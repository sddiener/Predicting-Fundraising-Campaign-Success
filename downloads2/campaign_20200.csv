<h3>What shuts you down? </h3>
<h3>What really makes you HAPPY?</h3> <p></p>
<div>These are the types of questions we asked ourselves while conceiving this world premiere play, <i>Happy</i> by Liz Thaler, premiering in F*ckFest, a sex positive theatre festival at The Brick (Williamsburg, NYC) in June 2015.</div>
<div>This multi-faceted, funny, and, above all, honest portrayal of kink culture was created to represent this much-misunderstood and maligned community with respect and realness (think: anti-<i>50 Shades</i>).</div>
<div>
<p>HAPPY originated as a 10 minute play in 3 parts, developed through Amios' monthly short play series SHOTZ, for December 2013's Erotica-themed <i>Voulez Vous Coucher Avec SHOTZ</i>?. This version was remounted for 6 performances at The Brick as part of the Winter Tens One Act festival in January 2014, taking second place in the two-week competition. </p>
<p>After such intense investigation into these characters, playwright Liz Thaler then expanded the piece, taking those first 10 minutes and following its players through their changing and challenging relationships. The full length was then given a public staged reading by Amios in April 2014 at Shetler Studios. </p>
<p>The play continues to evolve in an open collaboration with the creative team, who relishes an opportunity to produce a minimalist festival staging to further workshop the full-length piece before they embark upon a full run in 2015/16.</p>
</div>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Though our production costs are low, and we receive a lot of assistance from The Brick, we still need to compensate the artists involved with this premiere production. Your <u>tax-deductible </u>contribution through In Extremis' fiscal sponsorship with Fractured Atlas will go directly to paying the incredible team of artists a modest stipend for their time and talent, as well as helping offset the costs of all of the costumes, props, and set required to bring this show to life.</p>
<p>What do you get in return (other than the satisfaction of supporting new work and emerging artists)? Check out the perks to your right! You could receive a personal video from Liz and Lauren explaining the kink term of your choice, tickets to the show, invitations to the official cast party, or even take home an actual prop from the show!</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Your Impact</h3> <p>HAPPY's F*ckFest production will, in many ways, enable the creators to embark on a longer and more fully realized production run in the future. Through rehearsal, we will continue to discover and develop the script, and how we want to bring it to life. New audiences will be exposed to the work, including industry professionals who can assist the creative team in securing the connections and funding necessary for a full run in their own space. And, it is our hope that through this work we will shine a different light on the kink community than has been represented elsewhere in the media. </p>
<p>Most importantly, we hope entertain and enlighten audiences from Brooklyn and beyond with this challenging and thoughtful new work.</p>

<p><b>OUR STORY</b></p>
<p>Kelrik has been dedicated to
providing quality live theater in San Luis Obispo and Los Angeles for years. Our
goal is to challenge, motivate, enlighten and captivate our audiences; to
introduce young children to, and foster their appreciation of live theater; to
evoke thought and change, both personally and within our society; and, of
course to entertain. After the loss of our beloved home at Unity in 2013 we
have diligently searched or a new place to call home.  However the process has been a little bumpy
financially.</p>

<br/>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">WHY DO WE NEED IT?</b></p>
<p>Producing Theatre is a huge
undertaking and isn’t possible without the support of our community. While we
at Kelrik are masters of making the most out of very little, with two major
productions coming up, we need your help getting them up and running to their
highest quality. The cost of putting up Peter Pan alone, will be about $50,000.
Willy Wonka is close to $30,000.</p>
<p>Only 50% of a theatre company’s
income is achieved  by ticket sales.  For any theatre company to
flourish and remain financially stable, it relies on donations from
organizations, private donors, volunteers, partnerships, corporate sponsors,
grants, and fundraising efforts.   That means we have to rely on our
community for support.</p>
<p>We need some financial LOVE from you
in order to cover all the production costs including:</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>*Performance Rights and Music</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>*Theater and Rehearsal rental space</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>*Director, Choreographer, Musical Director, Designers</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>*Costumes, Props and Sets</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>*Lighting</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>*Promotion and Advertising</p>
<p>We are committed giving our actors and audience a
professional theater experience.  Every dollar raised will go toward
production costs for our 2015 CELEBRATE season.  With your help, this
season will be a year of growth, change and opportunity for many exciting and
challenging entertaining productions.  </p>

<div>We are Christine Noah, Quincy Newkirk, and Amos McCandless, and together we are The Avant Guardians, a new local theatre company in Charlotte, NC committed to producing contemporary work and pushing boundaries. We are all Davidson College alumni who studied theatre and decided that our passion for our creative art could not be ignored. Of course, we have our day jobs to keep our lights on and our cupboards full of mac 'n' cheese: Christine works for a nonprofit, Quincy is the fellow for Davidson's Department of Theatre, and Amos is a college counselor. But we have all been witness to the transformative, subversive, and unifying power of theatre, and we are committed to sharing that power with our community.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>To that end, we have set out to produce the Regional Premiere of Mike Bartlett's BULL. First produced in 2013, BULL is described by Dramatists Play Service as ""an allegorical deathmatch between business colleagues—full of bizarre power plays and one-upmanship—wherein one of three employees is allegedly going to be fired. The odds against our protagonist are stacked from the outset: rumple-faced sad-sack Thomas never quite gets his footing against opponents Tony, a shark in wolf's clothing, and Isobel, a snaky number with a talent for undermining."" </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>British playwright Bartlett got the idea for the play from watching an actual bull fight in Mexico. ""It’s a hard and complicated thing to see something you really disapprove of and hate but that does things to your animalistic instincts, which is thrilling,” he said in an interview with the Evening Standard. “You can see why Christians and lions happened, why people turned out for public hangings, why people love seeing these things on the internet — it activates something primal and unsanitised.” </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Bartlett said he wanted above all to show “how bullying works when you are an adult, which is quite a different thing to how it happens when you are a child. It is quite difficult to see it but if you are on the receiving end you feel it straight away. In an office, often you don’t notice it until it is already happening and you are complicit in it. Sometimes it is almost as if the person being bullied is playing up to the role they have been cast in because it’s a way of taking part.” This subject is something that real people with real jobs and real lives can relate to--something Bartlett thinks is essential for work to connect with audiences.</div>

<div>If we do not reach our goal, we will reduce our production costs as much as we can and fund it ourselves, using our box office proceeds to fill in the gaps.

<p>Based on a
true story of a young woman who fled Uganda to escape an honor killing at the
hands of her father, <i>Asylum</i> is a vivid display of courage and an unyielding
will to live. Philadelphia was at the heart of this production from the very beginning (the cast and crew from the world premier were all from the Philly region), and it's fitting that we strive to bring it to our home city---the city of Brotherly Love--one that is known for having passionate people who stand up for what's right whether it's easy to do so or not. </p>
<p><i>Asylum</i> is an
award-winning play (NYC 2012 Downtown Urban Theater Festival) that is about
human rights, gay rights and women’s rights. It is more than entertainment. It

PHILADELPHIA SPRING 2015!
Based on a
true story of a young woman who fled Uganda to escape an honor killing at the
hands of her father, Asylum is a vivid display of courage and an unyielding
will to live. Philadelphia was at the heart of this production from the very beginning (the cast and crew from the world premier were all from the Philly region), and it's fitting that we strive to bring it to our home city---the city of Brotherly Love--one that is known for having passionate people who stand up for what's right whether it's easy to do so or not. 
Asylum is an
award-winning play (NYC 2012 Downtown Urban Theater Festival) that is about
human rights, gay rights and women’s rights. It is more than entertainment. It
is bigger than theatre. It is about the courage to fight for one’s right to dignity, and the most primal and deepest human need of all: LOVE. Though the
story delves into religious intolerance and violence against
women, it still manages to capture the power of faith, the force of will and
the audacity of hope. Asylum has a raw honesty that’s not only unique to the story,

<p>A tale emerges of two women unraveling the sacrifices expected of them for migration, survival, and love. Between dreams, nightmares, and islands, they attempt to grasp the ways that hands have touched their bodies. Emerging Black playwright Phanésia Pharel brings her magical play LUCKY to the Conch Shell New Works Reading Series. Inspired by Cuba and the island of Quisqueya, the play challenges audiences as these women come to terms with sexual trauma and discover the power of healing through writing. Simply put: <i>When the black girls dance, God smiles and the world becomes alive.</i></p>
<p>LUCKY will be presented on Saturday, October 12th, 2019 at A.R.T./NY Studios.</p>
<h3>Past, Present, Future</h3>
<p>LUCKY was first presented as a developmental workshop at Barnard College in March 2019. The staged reading featured a full creative team and cast of seven, and was produced by the student theatre association NOMADS (New and Original Music Authored and Directed by Students). The five-week workshop process centered on character-building discussions, consent workshops, and strengthening the historical and cultural foundations of the play. The final presentation played to a full house, selling out in less than one day. </p>
<p>Now we’re pushing the story further with a professional reading at the Conch Shell New Works Reading Series, a company dedicated to developing and producing new works by Caribbean-American writers. We’re looking to use this opportunity to workshop the play and discover what it needs to be the best it can be. We’re excited to explore the rhythm of LUCKY by working with some of the best talents in New York City and presenting it in a space centered around Caribbean voices. We value our artists’ time and will not be asking anyone to work for free. Our anticipated budget is divided into 2/3rds for cast and creative stipends and 1/3rd for other production costs.</p>
<p>LUCKY will have a life past this workshop. It is an important, powerful, and timely story that deserves to be on the stage. As with any great art, it takes time to create and revise and fully realize. Thank you for taking a chance on emerging artists and supporting new work.</p>

<p><i>SeaBus is a small collective of movers that reside in Columbus, Ohio, who share interest in researching, improvising &amp; performing together. Co-Directors, Kelly Hurlburt &amp; Josh Hines, along with the collective, navigate the ""dance"" between the collision of form (technique &amp; choreography) with improvisation (instincts, and impulse.) SeaBus is fueled by collaboration and it's frame constantly fluctuates as opportunities to work and perform with artists arise both near and far.</i></p>
<p><i>Milk &amp; Bones, our newest collaborative evening-length venture, will premiere at The Fisher Theatre on February 16th at 8pm and 17th at 2pm.

</div><div>
<p><i>We need supporters and backers like you to lift us up and into action! A contribution of any amount is a huge help. By contributing to our project, you are supporting a niche and nurtured form of dance art that is rarely seen in a performance setting, let alone in the midwest. </i></p>
<p><i>A challenge dancers and artists are constantly facing is being underpaid for hours of hard work. There is a common stigma that dancers cannot make a living doing what they love to do.

</div><div>
<h2><i>THE IMPACT</i></h2>
<p><i>Dance improvisation, when used as a means of performance, creates surprising and daring compositions in real-time. We listen, support, and grow by sharing space with one another. Being an improvisational dance company means that we have the opportunity to be vulnerable, sensitive, and trusting in order to create arresting, yet ephemeral compositions in the moment. This is the draw of dance improvisation; this is the reason we want to share it with all of you!</i></p>
<p><i>We intend to demonstrate how dance improvisation is a valuable and enriching medium, while also bringing contemporary dance to the forefront of an already rich visual and musical arts community in Columbus. The performers will come together for a week long rehearsal intensive that culminates in a weekend of performances at Columbus Dance Theatre's resident space, The Fischer Theatre.  This project will not only make contemporary dance accessible throughout the greater Columbus community, but it will also provide educational opportunities through community events, including workshops, open rehearsals, and “talk-backs” after each performance</i></p>
</div><div>
<h2><i>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</i></h2>
<p><i>Starting a dance company is no easy task, when we can find the time in our busy everyday work lives and gather in one location and create a cohesive work, the process can be quite demanding. At the end of the day, we are all improvising, which means anything can and does happen. However, attuning to ten other people in a space and being able to come to an understanding is the reason why we dance in the first place. There is something so special about having an unspoken, mind-reading, ""aha"" moment with ten other people. And then that moment is gone.</i></p>

<h2>OLIVES AND BLOOD</h2>
<p><strong>By Michael Bradford, Directed by May Adrales</strong></p>
<h3><strong>June 9th - 24th</strong></h3>
<p><strong><em>It is said in Spain that the dead are always more alive than the day they were born. </em><em>So it is for the presumed murderer of Federico Garcia Lorca, Juan Luis Trescante Medina. Sixty years after Lorca's death, the aging fascist, Trescante, fights to hold onto the myth of a murder that defined his life. But in Spain, sixty years is little more than a breath, and a reckoning is all but inevitable.</em></strong></p>
<p>Being presented at HERE as part of the prestigious <strong>HEREstay program</strong>.</p>
<div>
<h3>From the Playwright...</h3>
<p>I fell in love with Lorca's poetry and plays, his voice and his elegiac conversation about ""duende,"" which can be loosely translated as <em>having soul</em>, expression and authenticity. I was also intrigued about his murder in 1936 and the myriad of conversations about Lorca’s works that are still so prescient in the contemporary moral and political conversation in Spain.<br/>  <br/> The play speaks to issues all along the spectrum of humanity; arrogance, fear, self-delusion, dignity, love and redemption. The play takes the time to look at a human being at a specific moment in time, from every angle, and lets each audience member take away what speaks to him or her.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>About the Playwright...</h3>
<p>""Michael Bradford is one of those rare playwrights who captures the depth, power, and soul of his characters. His work is both theatrical and poetic; it is poignant and relevant. When I experience a Michael Bradford play, I am stepping into a world that is full of life and longing.""  --- Daniella Topol, Past Artistic Programming Director of the Lark Play Development Center</p>

Gog is produced by North Shore natives Jason Lindner (Yale MFA Playwright) and 
Brant Russell (Northwestern MFA Director) and stars Steep Theater ensemble member 
Michael Salinas. The darkly comic tale is a twisted glimpse into how an underbelly 
artist conjures energies beyond his control. Equal parts indictment, satire, and 
cautionary tale, The Gog/Magog Project  is an absurdist nightmare in a cage.  



The Impact


This bold and daring project is based on the mysterious demise of performance 
artist Alexander Gog, an event still shrouded in rumor and supposition, and which, 
due to ongoing legal considerations, must be presented in this fictionalized manner. 
When Gog began his askew project â€“ to lock himself in a theatre for a year and 
perform ever night at eight, Sunday matinees at two â€“ he had no way to know what 
had been set in motion. Fifteen years of confinement later, scant remaining notes of 
the project reveal disturbing images of torture by Banana Moon Pie, exploitation by 
â€œBig Pharma,â€ and involvement from security agencies of a secret derivation. 
Ragged pages, many hastily burnt or hopelessly redacted, can only hint at the 
hundreds of humiliations piled on an unsuspecting victim in the name of the

<h3>The Importance of Running in My Life</h3>
<p>   My name is Michelle Landry, I am 27 years old, and have been running ever since I could walk.  Growing up I was always playing with the neighborhood kids, out running the boys, and lucky enough to be involved in organized sports (soccer, basketball).  In high school I went on to finding my niche in running hurdles and competing in high jump, long jump, and triple jump on the track team.</p>
<p>     However, there were many obstacles to over come such as multiple sports injuries such as Patella Femoral Syndrome-which I had to see a physical therapist for, shin splints, and other muscle strains/ scrapes and bruises.  Having supportive friends, family members, teachers, and coaches, helped me to increase my self confidence as an awkward and lanky 5'8"", 105 lb teenager. They also helped me push myself to qualify for and compete in state meets and receive multiple sports honors such MVP.  With my new found confidence I was able to find a defined career path and future helping others, as a physical therapist, just as I had been helped.</p>
<p>    But I am one of the lucky ones who had a supportive community and network of role models to guide me in the right direction, of whichever life path I chose.  There are many girls who are not so lucky.</p>
<p>    So I hope that by running my first full marathon (26.2 miles!!!) in Chicago this October, I can give back, in the hopes that girls like myself, will grow up to be strong individuals who will enrich their community. As the money I raise will create valuable scholarship funds for girls who can't afford to be part of this amazing organization.   </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Charity!!</h2>
<p>I see Girls On The Run as an active 'Girl Scout' Group who try to inspire girls to be healthy and confident. They manage fun, after-school programs involving running, and training for a team based 5k event.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>""Over the past 13 years, Girls on the Run-Chicago has served more than 27,000 girls aged 8-14 across 6 Chicagoland counties. In 2013, more than 1,000 coaches will mentor 8,000 girls - empowering them with the confidence and character they need to become strong, healthy women.""</p>

</h3><p></p>
<blockquote><p align=""justify""><i>Go into the arts. I’m not
kidding. The arts are not a way to make a living. They are a very human way of
making life more bearable. Practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a
way to make your soul grow, for heaven’s sake. Sing in the shower. Dance to the
radio. Tell stories. Write a poem to a friend, even a lousy poem. Do it as well
as you possibly can. You will get an enormous reward. You will have created
something.</i></p></blockquote><h3><i>
</i></h3><p align=""right""><i>= KURT VONNEGUT</i></p>
<p>
</p><h3></h3><p></p><p>OUR MISSION is to do what Kurt Vonnegut said: practice our art and make our souls grow.</p><p></p><p>We
are a group of family and friends who remember how much fun we’ve had through
the years doing plays. In fact, many of us became friends – and family – doing
theater. Though most of us have jobs and responsibilities that fill up our
lives, we still find ourselves thinking:<span> 
“You know, it’s time for me to get back on the stage.”  Or:  “It’s about time I heard that piece performed.”  But when, or how?  Well, collectively, we’ve decided that we
don’t need to wait for an invitation to pursue our dreams. With your help, we
can provide an opportunity for ourselves. </span></p>
<p>And
in making theater <u>now</u>, we celebrate a new wave of participatory life. We
strike a blow against virtual experience.  We come together to have fun
and give wing to the dormant spirits inside us.  Perhaps the same is true
for you?</p>
<p>Our
festival consists of 8 short pieces. They are each original in every sense of
the word.<span>  They are also varied in
style and genre, their multiplicity reflecting the differences in our life
experiences, which you can see in our bios below. But they all have one thing
in common:  each will have been carefully
nurtured and produced by talented and dedicated people.</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p>
<h3>WHAT WE NEED </h3>
<p>To make F-Fest possible, we need
a dozen actors, at least three directors, and two stage managers.<span>  We need to build a set, find props,
design lights, and create a sound design that suits 8 pieces.  And of course, we need to rent a
theater.</span></p>
<p>Our goal for all this was $5,000.</p><p><br/></p>
<h3>WHAT YOU GAVE<br/>
</h3>
<p>You gave more than we asked, which is the height of generosity.  Though all who gave are listed under the Funders tab above, we believe you deserve to be publicly lauded here and now.</p><p>A titanic thank you, then, to <b>Rob Mason, David Goodman, Ava

kidding. The arts are not a way to make a living. They are a very human way of
making life more bearable. Practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a
way to make your soul grow, for heaven’s sake. Sing in the shower. Dance to the
radio. Tell stories. Write a poem to a friend, even a lousy poem. Do it as well
as you possibly can. You will get an enormous reward. You will have created
something.
= KURT VONNEGUT

OUR MISSION is to do what Kurt Vonnegut said: practice our art and make our souls grow.We
are a group of family and friends who remember how much fun we’ve had through
the years doing plays. In fact, many of us became friends – and family – doing
theater. Though most of us have jobs and responsibilities that fill up our
lives, we still find ourselves thinking: 
“You know, it’s time for me to get back on the stage.”  Or:  “It’s about time I heard that piece performed.”  But when, or how?  Well, collectively, we’ve decided that we
don’t need to wait for an invitation to pursue our dreams. With your help, we
can provide an opportunity for ourselves. 
And
in making theater now, we celebrate a new wave of participatory life. We
strike a blow against virtual experience.  We come together to have fun
and give wing to the dormant spirits inside us.  Perhaps the same is true
for you?
Our
festival consists of 8 short pieces. They are each original in every sense of
the word.  They are also varied in
style and genre, their multiplicity reflecting the differences in our life
experiences, which you can see in our bios below. But they all have one thing
in common:  each will have been carefully
nurtured and produced by talented and dedicated people.
WHAT WE NEED 
To make F-Fest possible, we need
a dozen actors, at least three directors, and two stage managers.  We need to build a set, find props,
design lights, and create a sound design that suits 8 pieces.  And of course, we need to rent a
theater.
Our goal for all this was $5,000.
WHAT YOU GAVE

You gave more than we asked, which is the height of generosity.  Though all who gave are listed under the Funders tab above, we believe you deserve to be publicly lauded here and now.A titanic thank you, then, to Rob Mason, David Goodman, Ava
Seave, Miriam King, webernyc, jhharding, rcrispinojr, Marsha Norman, winter1,

<h2><strong>WHY WE ARE</strong></h2>
<p>Etta's Eyes Only was born from a mind-meld of ecstatic-high-school-aged-stary-eyed-naive-optimists, trying to prove that the world is an optimistic-naive-stary-eyed-ecstatic-high-schooler, itching to break traditions- and create them. We do what we do with what we have because we can. We are a haven, an exploration and a release, an artistic fix.</p>
<h2><strong>WHO WE ARE</strong></h2>
<p>We are made up of a ten member ensemble, all between the ages of 14 and 21. We have a technical crew of 15, also between the ages of 14 and 21, and we have a non-traditional quartet, still between the ages of 14 and 21.</p>
<p>Although Etta's Eyes Only (EEO) has grown from a figment of imagination into a fully functioning company- complete with actors, a director, a playwright, a costume department, a props department, a set, a master electrician, a publicity department, and a home venue- we're still naive, optimistic high-schoolers and college kids. And it's worked out pretty well for us so far. </p>
<h2><strong>OUR MISSION</strong></h2>
<p>The mission of Etta’s Eyes Only-Youth Theatre Company is to maintain an entirely youth-ran platform, thereby eliminating the confines of a school, or ""supervisor"" based program, and allowing aspiring theatre artists to explore and experiment with their art in whichever way they see fit. The company strives to present brave, important, artistic, and thought provoking theatre- proving that the youth is a truly important part of the artistic community.</p>
<h2><strong>OUR PRODUCTION</strong></h2>
<p>On August 1st, 2nd and 3rd at 7pm, we will be performing a home-grown version of Charles Mee's BIG LOVE at The State Theatre in down town South Bend. We have uniquely shaped the show to fit our ensemble, which creates a truly artistic piece of stage-craft. Charles Mee gives the following explanation of the show--</p>
<p>Fifty brides flee their fifty grooms and seek refuge in a villa on the coast of Italy in this modern re-making of one of the western world's oldest plays, The Danaids by Aeschylus. And, in this villa on the Italian coast, the fifty grooms catch up with the brides, and mayhem ensues: the grooms arriving by helicopter in their flight suits, women throwing themselves over and over again to the ground, pop songs and romantic dances, and, finally, unable to escape their forced marriages, 49 of the brides murder 49 of the grooms-and one bride falls in love. About the same odds as today.</p>
<p>The show was chosen because of its importance to the theatre community, it's creative opportunities, and its brave subject matter- which the members of EEO would not be able to experience in their high school funded theatre programs. </p>
<h2>WHERE YOUR MONEY GOES</h2>
<p>EEO is rich in all aspects but fiscally. And as such, we are desperately in need of funding to pay for things like: props, costumes, paint, lighting equipment, programs, posters, publicity, and other items which will help the production to have the largest impact it can on the local theatre world. </p>

There, </b>
</p>
<p>Good Day Ladies and
Gentlemen, and welcome to the indiegogo campaign page for Fishes, a
play by David Fennelly which will be returning to the stage this year
with your help. This play has already enjoyed a successful run in the
Collaborations Festival in Dublin. But we would like your help to
make it even bigger and better this time round. 
</p>
<p>	As you can see we are
asking for a total of €1,500 but every little helps, this money
will be used to fund the production costs of the play, such as the
lighting, materials for the set, costumes, and rental of a rehearsal
space, so that we can make sure the final performance is as perfect
as we believe it can be. So help us get this production off the
ground, and not only can we promise you an interesting, insightful,
darkly comic, and, let's face it, just downright kick ass, play at
the end of it all (the 3<sup>rd</sup> to 11<sup>th</sup> of December
in Smock Alley Boys’ School in Dublin to be exact) but we can also
offer you some interesting perks for helping us out!! For more
details read on. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Give
us your money!! We’ll make it worth your while: </b>
</p>
<p>Now we certainly don’t
expect you to just hand us your hard earned Spondooligs without at
least attempting to give you some form of reason to want to give them
to us. So, bear with me for the briefest of moments and I shall break
down some of what you get for being the hero we all know you are and
forking over the cold hard digital donations, and so you know we’re
not just asking you for money for the sake of asking I’ll give you
some details of where this money is going to go; 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><u>Rehearsal
	Space</u>: much as we love holding rehearsals in bedrooms, and
	living rooms. We would like to have the space for our actors to
	properly spread their arms, legs and other movement related
	appendages without slapping each other in the face, in order to make
	this play the absolute best that it can be. One of the first things
	we will be using your warm-hearted and incredibly kind donations for
	is the rental of a rehearsal space</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Lighting:</u>
	We do not want to have to perform in the dark, as interesting as
	that would be, this play calls for very specific lighting, and we’d
	like to know that when the curtain goes up, you will be able to see
	our actors’ faces. Believe me, they are a sight not to be missed. 
	Your kind donations will go a long way in shedding light on this
	fact, so please help (if you smiled at that pun make sure your
	friends, family, pets and other interested parties don't miss out on
	the fun by sharing this page on your social media site of choice)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Set Design</u>:
	Remember how I said we needed lights so that you could see
	our actors’ faces? You should, I literally just said it, we also
	need a set for them to act on, there would be nothing worse than
	having our actors have to mime opening and closing doors, and
	pretend to sit on chairs that aren’t really there. I don’t want
	to have to tell them they can’t have seats on the stage, or walls,
	so please, please help us give them the set they deserve, all of
	this will just make the already awesome play even more awesome.

Stop Press: A generous supporter is matching our contributions--up to
$5,000. Your donation will go even further to help develop the new
play about outsider art: The Strange Case of Henry Darger.</i> Proceeds from our performances will benefit the gallery in Chicago that has a
permanent installation of Henry Darger's studio - with the goal of promoting
contemporary self taught artists.</p>
<p><b>Our
project?</b></p>
<p>To
build awareness about the life and mind of an extraordinary man. He struggled as
a blue-collar worker with emotional difficulties. He made his art the passionate
focus of his life and did not seek an audience but after his death, it is
inspiring people around the globe. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">To create this body of work, despite such financial and personal suffering and hardship is testament to the drive and optimism of a pure artist. It has a giddily uplifting impact - that's our belief.</span></p>
<p><b>Who are we?</b></p><p><b>We are a team of drama professionals committed to developing this new stage play. It is a process that involves writing, workshopping with actors, editorial sessions with the director, more workshopping, reading in front of a live audience and getting feedback from question and answer sessions. And then back to the drawing board for the next bout in the hope of attracting a major theater company that will be able to take on the scope of this very visual play.</b></p><p><b>David Kersnar</b>, founding member of Lookingglass Theatre in Chicago
is haunted by the life and mind of a reclusive hospital cleaner <b><span>Henry Darger
(1892 - 1973)</span></b> who painted an astonishingly dramatic, beautiful epic
work over sixty years in his attic room in Chicago and wrote an accompanying
15,000 page novel about a war waged by soldiers who enslaved children and the
brave little androgynous girls who fought for freedom. </p>
<p>The play will have two
performances at the <span>Intuit Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art in Chicago on
August 8th and 9th. Box office proceeds will go to the museum/gallery,
which houses a permanent installation of Darger's astonishing studio. It is the only non profit in the USA that is dedicated solely to promotion the work of outsider and self-taught artists with exhibitions, resources and educational programming.</span></p><p><span> Henry Darger is undoubtedly now one of the best-known
outsider artists in the world. His troubled life in a school for the feeble
minded, the abuse he suffered and his stoic resilience are key to the reasons
for his fame. However even though his life story is poignant, his fame is
ultimately due to the brilliance of his art: the mixed media work that is
stunningly contemporary (elements of manga, graphic novel, cartoon, comic book,
and fantasy art) that is both unsettling and mesmeric.</span></p>
<p>David and Lookingglass
actor <b><span>Troy
West </span></b>have teamed up with journalist and veteran BBC radio producer,
playwright and director <b><a href=""http://www.judithkampfner.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Judith Kampfner</span></a></b>. Her play ‘
The Strange Case of Henry Darger’ has already had a reading at Lookingglass.
The team has taken it upon themselves to develop the play further and then shop
it to theaters around the globe in the hope of taking Darger to a new audience.</p>
<p>The team has carved out
time over the summer for two weeks of workshops over
June and July in Chicago, which will culminate in the Intuit Gallery Benefit
performances.  </p><p>This is a wholly independent project, which represents enormous challenges in turning it into a substantial stage production.  So, we are turning to friends and colleagues like you to help support it and spread the word.  This grassroots model is becoming more and more common in the arts and beyond, and we are striving to meet this challenge in a way that involves you and other fans.</p>

$5,000. Your donation will go even further to help develop the new
play about outsider art: The Strange Case of Henry Darger. Proceeds from our performances will benefit the gallery in Chicago that has a
permanent installation of Henry Darger's studio - with the goal of promoting
contemporary self taught artists.
Our
project?
To
build awareness about the life and mind of an extraordinary man. He struggled as
a blue-collar worker with emotional difficulties. He made his art the passionate
focus of his life and did not seek an audience but after his death, it is
inspiring people around the globe. To create this body of work, despite such financial and personal suffering and hardship is testament to the drive and optimism of a pure artist. It has a giddily uplifting impact - that's our belief.
Who are we?We are a team of drama professionals committed to developing this new stage play. It is a process that involves writing, workshopping with actors, editorial sessions with the director, more workshopping, reading in front of a live audience and getting feedback from question and answer sessions. And then back to the drawing board for the next bout in the hope of attracting a major theater company that will be able to take on the scope of this very visual play.David Kersnar, founding member of Lookingglass Theatre in Chicago
is haunted by the life and mind of a reclusive hospital cleaner Henry Darger
(1892 - 1973) who painted an astonishingly dramatic, beautiful epic
work over sixty years in his attic room in Chicago and wrote an accompanying
15,000 page novel about a war waged by soldiers who enslaved children and the
brave little androgynous girls who fought for freedom. 
The play will have two
performances at the Intuit Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art in Chicago on
August 8th and 9th. Box office proceeds will go to the museum/gallery,
which houses a permanent installation of Darger's astonishing studio. It is the only non profit in the USA that is dedicated solely to promotion the work of outsider and self-taught artists with exhibitions, resources and educational programming. Henry Darger is undoubtedly now one of the best-known
outsider artists in the world. His troubled life in a school for the feeble
minded, the abuse he suffered and his stoic resilience are key to the reasons
for his fame. However even though his life story is poignant, his fame is
ultimately due to the brilliance of his art: the mixed media work that is
stunningly contemporary (elements of manga, graphic novel, cartoon, comic book,
and fantasy art) that is both unsettling and mesmeric.
David and Lookingglass
actor Troy
West have teamed up with journalist and veteran BBC radio producer,
playwright and director Judith Kampfner. Her play ‘
The Strange Case of Henry Darger’ has already had a reading at Lookingglass.
The team has taken it upon themselves to develop the play further and then shop
it to theaters around the globe in the hope of taking Darger to a new audience.
The team has carved out
time over the summer for two weeks of workshops over
June and July in Chicago, which will culminate in the Intuit Gallery Benefit
performances.  This is a wholly independent project, which represents enormous challenges in turning it into a substantial stage production.  So, we are turning to friends and colleagues like you to help support it and spread the word.  This grassroots model is becoming more and more common in the arts and beyond, and we are striving to meet this challenge in a way that involves you and other fans.

Endorsements:
A very intriguing and imaginative interpretation of Darger’s life and work. I thought your play was ambitious and thought provoking.- Michael Bonesteel. Adjunct professor at School of the Art Institute of Chicago and Darger biographer. Judith Kampfner's work in progress is a trip down a theatrical rabbit hole. It's  deftly zig-zagging script makes the life of this fascinating outsider artist from Chicago even more enchanting, tragic and intriguingly strange. The play also brims with choice details of everyday life in early 20th century Chicago making it not only great drama but a time-traveling experience.- Tony Macaluso, Director of Syndication the WFMT Radio Network / The Studs Terkel Radio Archive
The Strange Case of Henry Darger,
brings both fictional intrigue and historical perspective to the ongoing public
fascination with the life and times of one Mr. Henry Darger .... While factual
in many ways, Judith Kampfner's engaging  fictional re enactment of an
important but still undetermined episode in Henry Darger's life, piques
 even further the curiosity surrounding his supposed involvement in a
horrible criminal act. 
- Carl Hammer of The Carl
Hammer Gallery in Chicago Judith Kampfner and Troy West

<p>We are a small group of people against the greed and corporations of america!...</p>
Not really.
<h2>The Story</h2>
<p>University of North Texas students, Book Writers Amir Ellis and Stephanie Clausen along side with Lyrist Corbin Young and Composer Grant Michael Goldberg have created an original full length musical. <br/><br/><em>Occupy:The Musical </em>is loosely based upon the occupy movement. It follows  two best friends, Riley and Sam, who leave their white-picket fences of suburbia for the hustle and the bustle of a nearby city to attend a Star Trek convention, when they stumble upon a local occupy movement. There they meet a cast of loveable misfits, a purpose for the occupy movement, and a purpose for themselves.</p>
<h3>How It All Started</h3>
<p>Ellis and Clausen watnted to work on a project together, and being students tasked with work and studies barely found the time or ideas. Until one day leaving a university theatre production and passing by the local occupy camp, an idea struck Ellis, 'Occupy The Musical', and for once Clausen didn't grimice at the idea.<br/>Soon after they found Young for lyrics, and Goldberg for musical scoring. What was a small idea soon became a full fleshed reality with the help of an on-campus student organization, Bored In Denton.<br/>BID provided some resources and space to put on a preview performance in November, and now with BID and your help, we are now ready for a full production for Spring 2013.<br/><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>The Financial Breakdown</h2>
<p>Through Bored In Denton, <em>Occupy: The Musical</em> has options for performance space, but not the funding for it or other expenses such as, printing, marketing, sets, costuming, and tech.</p>

Not really.
The Story
University of North Texas students, Book Writers Amir Ellis and Stephanie Clausen along side with Lyrist Corbin Young and Composer Grant Michael Goldberg have created an original full length musical. Occupy:The Musical is loosely based upon the occupy movement. It follows  two best friends, Riley and Sam, who leave their white-picket fences of suburbia for the hustle and the bustle of a nearby city to attend a Star Trek convention, when they stumble upon a local occupy movement. There they meet a cast of loveable misfits, a purpose for the occupy movement, and a purpose for themselves.
How It All Started
Ellis and Clausen watnted to work on a project together, and being students tasked with work and studies barely found the time or ideas. Until one day leaving a university theatre production and passing by the local occupy camp, an idea struck Ellis, 'Occupy The Musical', and for once Clausen didn't grimice at the idea.Soon after they found Young for lyrics, and Goldberg for musical scoring. What was a small idea soon became a full fleshed reality with the help of an on-campus student organization, Bored In Denton.BID provided some resources and space to put on a preview performance in November, and now with BID and your help, we are now ready for a full production for Spring 2013.


The Financial Breakdown
Through Bored In Denton, Occupy: The Musical has options for performance space, but not the funding for it or other expenses such as, printing, marketing, sets, costuming, and tech.
That's where you all come in handy.
Every dollar counts, every contribution is necessary in making this original student production a reality.
Every penny, dime, and dollar will go strictly into printing for cast, posters and programs; marketing to help get the word out and to fill every seat; sets will be limited to what we can find at local thrift stores and garage sales; costuming budget will be used for raw supplies; and the money for tech goes into paying for the people who will run the facility on campus.
Any leftover money, if any, will be donated to our sponsor, Bored In Denton, for them to use to help them put on more events on campus to showcase original UNT talent, like us!


The Purpose
We are all UNT students. This is a full student-run, created, and so far produced original musical to ever be done on campus at UNT. From our diverse cast of 30 actors and singers to the people who help run the technical equipment, we are all students.We've dedicated time, talent, and resources into making this a successful project. In November we debuted a preview for friends, student organizations, and sponsors to great sucess.Our cast is from diverse majors and backgrounds, but a passion for singing and performing.Together we have created an event in hopes to inspire others to do the same.

<p>The Penn Dixie ensemble is --&gt; Natalia Chami, Alex Suha, Julia Correa, Gaidig Mercier, Klas Lagerlund, Cecilie Solberg Knudsrod, Anisa George, and Mat Hare.</p>
<p>We live in seven different coutries --&gt; Argentina, USA, Brazil, UK, France, Sweden, and Norway.</p>
<p>We are trying to do the impossible --&gt; to overcome geographical and financial limitations which threaten our creative collaboration and to develop phenomenal work for international audiences.  </p>
<p><strong>The Story:</strong></p>
<p>We met at the London International School of Performing Arts, where we studied devised theater, and at the end of two years of training we decided to develop a tiny piece about the poet Arthur Rimbaud and his renunciation of art. It was about 12 minutes long. People really liked it. One of our teachers even said he laughed so hard he cried. So we decided to carry on to ...  </p>
<p>---&gt; <strong>PHASE 2 </strong>Where we rented some rehearsal space in London and tried to turn the baby piece into a full grown work. We invited some people to see our rough cut, and even though they were very encouraging we knew we had a long way to go. </p>
<p>---&gt; <strong>PHASE 3</strong> In the summer of 2011 we gathered together in a barn in Pennsylvania to get back to work and see what we could improve. We worked non-stop for a month building a set, gathering costumes, throwing out half of the material we had made, and reinventing a new half. At the end we all agreed the show was much improved. We even showed it to some audiences at the Philly Fringe, but we knew that - it still wasn't done!</p>
<p>Each time we return to <em>The Seer</em> it gets fiercer, deeper, and more potent. We are now seeking support to bring the play to its final and ultimate stage - to produce a professional theatrical run of it at the Edinburgh Festival in the summer of 2013. </p>
<p>The Edinburgh Festival is considered by many to be one of the most important, and certainly one of the largest theater festivals in the world. It provides an opportunity for young companies like ours to try and make a name for themselves on the international stage. Producing a play at Edinburgh presents some of the most difficult logistical and financial challenges a company can face. It is a mad chaotic marketplace where sometimes miracles happen. </p>
<p>We have received official offers from a number of venues who would like to present our show. To follow through with these offers we require financial support, and so we are turning to you.</p>
<p>---&gt;<strong> THE FINAL PHASE </strong>is up to you!</p>
<p>We need to raise $23,000 to make <em>The Seer</em> happen this year. Because we are a truely international company we are disqualified from many govermental grants. National grants want to fund their own national citizens, and our company does not belong to one nation - it belongs to seven! But we don't want the fact that we don't qualify for limited regional funding to limit our creative lives. We are dreaming big and turning to you - our new govenment - for support. </p>
<p>This is our first time trying Indiegogo - a grassroots, crowd funding method developed to assist emerging artists and creators of all kinds to produce their work. If you feel moved to donate, we've got some nifty gifts on offer to reward you. If you can't give, then spread the word! If you can't spread the word, then just send us some positive vibes. </p>

<div>By coincidence, we met in November of 2012 at a ballroom dance studio and very quickly decided to partner together and explore our shared passion for dance. For Kiri, competing in ballroom dance was a second chance to perform and entertain audiences with her years of technical training and experience. For Marc, competing in ballroom dance was an oppurtunity to make a substantial achievement in a second career, after having found his passion for dance late in life.  We invite you to join us on our journey as we prepare to compete!</div>

As part of the site-specific category, we are performing in a Toronto bar where every corner, stool, rail, and window is the stage. There's lots of fun in store and on tap! Seriously. It could get crazy. We aim to use our show as vehicle to create a one-of-a-kind theatrical experience where both the audience and artist may be surprised by what takes place. Hey nonny nonny hey!</span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"">
<span>The Show: </span><em>Surviving Speares</em>
</h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>“I had a dream last night, where I was in a bar, with Shakespeare and all of his characters, and they spoke in rhyme, and we all drank beer, and then Juliet whipped out a guitar, and we all sang. I forget how it ended. But it was crazy. It was fun.”</span>- <em>Cast member, </em>Andrew Petker<em>, (Hamlet) gives his synopsis of <strong>Survivng Speares</strong>.</em></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In our premier show, we combine our homegrown script with improv and clowning styles (based on the teachings of Jacques Lecoq) to push the audience-artist relationship to the limit (wherever that is). Juliet may ask you on a date, Shakespeare may interview you to be his new muse...We know where it starts but we don't know where it will end. In this show, audience and artist are allies, so get ready patrons, because the bard is in!</p>
<h2 dir=""ltr"">A bit about us - Charlatan Remedies:</h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>We are a theatre company committed to concocting cures for social stiffness.</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Co-founders, A. Massoud, A. Simpson, and R. Liddiard, are three young ladies who are seriously aware that we are part of a fast-paced generation, living in a fast-paced world. Everyday we are uncomfortably aware that ours is a time where a million, delightful opportunities are missed, simply because we have lost the incentive to properly interact - that is, converse face-to-face (iPhone FaceTime doesn't count!) We refer to this epidemic as “<em>social stiffness</em>”.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We began <strong>Charlatan Remedies</strong> to find cures for this social ailment via original dramatic works (written by us) that seek to inspire new camaraderies in our audiences that (we hope!) they will carry out into the community.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">For our first demonstration, we have been accepted into the Toronto Fringe Festival with an original show, <strong><em>Surviving Speares</em></strong>.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> “the Stranger” -- an ongoing study and discourse, is inspired by Latino choreographer David Herrera’s experience growing up poor in Hollywood, CA. Using the personal stories of the director and cast, “the Stranger” presents the difficulty of finding and defining oneself through one’s inclusion and exclusion from different communities when poverty, culture, and media images intercede. In this current episode DHPCo. reveals how a person’s position within America’s class system affects their paths of self and community identity, and the consequences those chosen paths may have.</p>
<p>“Growing up, I didn’t realize I was poor”, explains Herrera. “We were just living, and in my child’s eyes, quite happy. It wasn't until I became an adolescent that I began to see the difference between me and my schoolmates. The clothes they wore, the things they did or DIDN’T have to do, and things they possessed that were clearly out of my parents’ (and my) reach”.</p>
<p>Through a seamless fusion of modern dance, theater, and text, Herrera lends a voice to “the Stranger” that bears from the inner struggle of someone growing up within conflicting communities, in this case the working-class and middle/upper-class. In particular, Herrera sheds light on the complexities of someone making personal choices in regards to identity within the structures of status and class limitations.</p>
<p>Can we come to define and identify ourselves (and be at peace with those decisions) by pushing away culture and even family? Or are we in danger of becoming a permanent stranger to the self by doing so? “the Stranger” brings to life the complexities of inclusion and exclusion that the working class may experience, and the struggle to understand and find oneself within all this terrain.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are hoping to raise $2,800+ to pay for our two weekends, a total of 6 shows at Dance Mission Theater in San Francisco.  If you help us obtain this milestone we will be able to offset the cost of theater rental freeing up the ticket sales to pay our performers which is the ultimate goal.  </p>
<p>*NOTE: most dancers make under minimum wage via stipends but deserve much much more for the time, commitment, energy, and body work they put into a full season of rehearsals, tours, and performances.  We at DHPCo. are working hard to fulfill this obligation but we do still need your assistance.  </p>
<p>Last year we had a very successful fundraising season in part thanks to you and the many who attended the show. WE hope to continue our ongoing relationships with all of you, consider donating once again.</p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>With modern dance as our medium DHPCo presents work that tell stories of the human condition.  We make dance works accessible through narrative, story telling, and visceral  choreography.  We are particulary interested in bringing in a""non-traditional"" dance  audience including folks from underrespresented (i.e. Latino/Hispanic) and lower income communities who are seldom exposed to modern dance.  </p>
<p>In “the Stranger” DHPCo. exposes topics that are taboo or difficult for many to admit. In particular: shame, regret, and the consequences of having to choose one identity over another.  Herrera explains, “It is important to understand how our finances affect both communities and individuals alike.  We cannot go pretending that financial classes don't exist or even worse, that they don't affect us in long-lasting personal ways.” </p>
<p>We have a rich history of culturally influenced dance pieces including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A) A Modern World: Latino Perspectives (2009)</li>
<li>B) History of Flight: An Immigration Story (2009)</li>

<h2><strong>What Are We Doing? <br/></strong></h2>
<p>Orlando Shakespeare Theater in Partnership with UCF is preparing to do <em>Titus Andronicus</em> for the first time in 24 years. <em>Titus</em> is known as Shakespeare’s bloodiest and most violent work. In order to make this production a savage success, we need money to concoct enough fake blood to fill 15 bodies (so we will not have to actually slaughter our actors every night).</p>
<h3>Concept</h3>
<p>Here is the concept for the play from the director, Jim Helsinger:</p>
<p>""This is going to be a terrific Titus with a small cast in an intimate thrilling space, close-up and personal. The set is basically white and gets completely splattered in blood by the end of the show. Each death is choreographed to be both artistic and horrifying. They start out realistic and get more and more artistic with each death, until we are literally throwing buckets of blood in the last scene. People are stabbed, shot and sacrificed, hands cut off, a tongue cut out and it includes the most murders of any Shakespeare play. Simple, gory, horrific, sick and twisted, Titus was the most popular of Shakespeare's plays during his lifetime!""</p>
<h3><strong>How Much Blood???</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>About the Play </strong></h3>
<p>Shocking, savage, and outrageously entertaining – <em>Titus Andronicus</em> is a cataclysmic cycle of revenge between the families of Titus, the great Roman general, and Tamora, the sadistic Queen of the Goths. Each of their barbarous and diabolical acts begets more brutal acts of retaliation. Theatrically vivid and surprisingly moving, <em>Titus Andronicus</em> is what a summer blockbuster would be if it were written by the world's great genius of language and theater.</p>

What Are We Doing? 
Orlando Shakespeare Theater in Partnership with UCF is preparing to do Titus Andronicus for the first time in 24 years. Titus is known as Shakespeare’s bloodiest and most violent work. In order to make this production a savage success, we need money to concoct enough fake blood to fill 15 bodies (so we will not have to actually slaughter our actors every night).
Concept
Here is the concept for the play from the director, Jim Helsinger:
""This is going to be a terrific Titus with a small cast in an intimate thrilling space, close-up and personal. The set is basically white and gets completely splattered in blood by the end of the show. Each death is choreographed to be both artistic and horrifying. They start out realistic and get more and more artistic with each death, until we are literally throwing buckets of blood in the last scene. People are stabbed, shot and sacrificed, hands cut off, a tongue cut out and it includes the most murders of any Shakespeare play. Simple, gory, horrific, sick and twisted, Titus was the most popular of Shakespeare's plays during his lifetime!""
How Much Blood???
 1 Roman General
+  4 Martial Sons
+   1 Beautiful Daughter
+2 Imperial Contenders
+ 4 Lascivious Goths
+  1 Evil (volde)Moor(t)_________________________ 15 deaths x2½ gallons per performancex 38 performances _________________________
115 gallons of blood = GRAND TOTAL: $5000
 
About the Play 
Shocking, savage, and outrageously entertaining – Titus Andronicus is a cataclysmic cycle of revenge between the families of Titus, the great Roman general, and Tamora, the sadistic Queen of the Goths. Each of their barbarous and diabolical acts begets more brutal acts of retaliation. Theatrically vivid and surprisingly moving, Titus Andronicus is what a summer blockbuster would be if it were written by the world's great genius of language and theater.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><span>Constance has a dream Her dream is to become a member of the Martha Graham Dance Company. She has already taken steps to getting started. This summer she was asked to begin the Graham Program and start rehearsals with the Graham II, the second company of Martha Graham. Constance has proven time and time again that she will make her goals become realities. She graduated from Southern Methodist University with a degree in Dance. It was not the easiest road to walk. After being denied a spot in the Meadows Dance division twice, she showed everyone that she wasn’t going to give up. Being accepted finally to the program she became a force to be reckoned with. She became a strong worker, a reliable dancer, and even created some of her own works. She went from being a second thought in the dance world, to becoming a potentially great dancer in the real world. As her next goal to reach the top, she is going to start working with Graham II, and prove to them that she has what it takes to make it in their company. She cannot achieve this goal alone, and should you contribute to her goal, you will be part of her journey to the world stage, and she and her support team will be forever grateful. What She Needs Realistically speaking, this endeavor will cost somewhere in the range of $30,000. We are starting with an initial raise of $6000 to help get her through the first year of her work. Instructional lessons, travel, shoes, physical health management it is all needed to achieve this level. Constance's drive, passion, focus, and talent will make her goals a reality. She is limited only by the funds available to help make her dreams come true. The Impact Constance will become something great, and she will do this because she is blessed with such a strong and passionate support system. By becoming part of this system you too with impact the art world. We realize some of you won't be able to contribute but that doesn't mean you can't help!

Kore Theatre Project is a brand new company conceived by current students of the Stella Adler Studio of Acting. Kore Theatre Project aims to inspire, thrill, and educate audiences with productions that range from classics to new works. With a keen interest in physical theatre and a passion for Greek mythologies, this company hopes to ignite the imagination of the American theatre community with our innovative productions and original devised work. We strive to develop the minds and bodies of the next theatre generation.     This campaign will fund Kore Theatre Project's Inaugural production of Sarah Ruhl's Eurydice. Eurydice will premiere this August at the Bandshell in Jackie Robinson Park on 84 Bradhurst Ave, New York, New York. The performances will take place at 7 pm on August 14,15,16, & 17. Directed by Kore Theatre Project's Artistic Director, Elizabeth Lanier, this production will deal with love, memory, and what happens when we choose to gamble with fate. As a company, we are looking to reinvest in the actor's imagination. Therefore, this will be a minimalist production and the atmospheric elements will be entirely created by the actors' bodies and voices. Our fantastic cast is comprised of recent graduates as well as current students of the Stella Adler Studio of Acting: Eurydice.....................Ajna Jaisinghani
Her Father.................Greg Pragel
Orpheus......................Dustin Teuber
A Nasty Interesting Man/ The Lord of the Underworld.................George Bull
Little Stone................Palmyra Mattner
Big Stone....................Sara Witter
Loud Stone.................Frederika Reinhardt 

This production's Movement Coach is founding member and artistic associate, Cely Rivera. Our Music Director is artistic associate, Palmyra Mattner, who will also be playing the role of Little Stone!  By contributing to this campaign, you are enabling young artists to create innovative work which is easily accessible to the New York community. Additionally, you are helping Kore Theatre Project get started from the ground up!

<p></p><h3>Short Summary </h3><p>Help us  bring our show to The Edinburgh Free Fringe and continue creating and devising Ideas Worth  a Penny!</p><p>We need your help to produce our first show, The Virgin and the Lamb,  where Mary and Jesus are satirical characters played by two outcasts who surrender everything for their dream to fly with a low cost airline.  They entertain the audience by making fun of society while asking the question: is it worth the sacrifice to follow society's idea of what is right?<br/><br/></p><p>Our brand new company, Ideas Worth a Penny, is an international cast of performers who were brought together in Paris at Ecole Philippe Gaulier. Carmen Arquelladas(Spain), Simone Tani(Italy), Miwa Nagai(Japan) and Duncan Cameron (Canada) are interested with focusing on themes through Bouffon, which questions the importance of the mainstream belief of happiness, and gives a point of view to the outcasts and those who have been rejected from society. These people come back from their shadows to show us the truths in the lies that we build our lives upon. </p><p>The Virgin and the Lamb, a highly original and subversive bouffon show combining darkly funny sketch with song, comedy and satire,  will be presented at the Balham Fringe Festival and at the Edinburgh Free Fringe Festival. </p><p>The first showings of bits of our show in London has been very successful, we need your help to go further.<br/></p>With your funding you can help us to move our first steps as a company and take our work at the biggest theatre festival in Europe.<br/><br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>We are raising £2,200 which constitutes a portion of the budget for our show.

As well as taking the pressure off of our budget for costume and props, travel costs and accommodation in Edinburgh.  Your funding would give us more freedom to develop ideas that would have otherwise been out of our price range. We then would be able to look into the option of  creating a higher quality promotional video along with flyers that will aid us to be seen among the many other shows in Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Having a good promotional pack will open doors to future opportunities and help us grow as a company.</p><p></p><p>Your help, is vital even a small donation can make a big difference.</p><br/><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>With your contribution you'll give legs to a brand new international theatre company. Your support is vital for us in this moment, because budget for brand new theatre companies is a great challenge. </p><p>With your contribution you'll help us to give a voice to the societies rejects. We like to lead the audience through
a short journey of self doubt and questioning. Also showing them how
people regarded as awful, and not even worth the pity, can show the
beauty of humanity. How do they see what is regarded as important for
life and happiness?  How do they parody these beliefs?</p><p>
</p><p>We
are also looking to create theatrical experiences where we involve,
and arouse, laughing from the audience as well as a sickening feeling
that they are not innocent.  We explore themes such as the
maltreatment of elderly, by exposing care home abuse. Gay exclusion,
by revealing homophobia, and racism by presenting differences in
cultural beliefs.  As these themes can be quite risky and heavy, we
work a lot with humor to keep the scenes light in appearance but deep
in concept, this is something we are proud of and we hope to get your support to keep developing it.

Siamo interessati alle tematiche di solito affrontate con la tecnica del ""buffone"", che mette in discussione l'importanza di quanto dato per scontato dalla società come giusto da perseguire e fonte di felicità. Il buffone fornisce il punto di vista degli esclusi e degli emarginati. Questi personaggi escono dall'ombra, in cui sono invitati a stare, per metter in luce la verità tra le maglie  delle bugie su cui è costruita la nostra società.<br/><br/>""The Virgin and the Lamb"", è uno spettacolo originale e sovversivo che combina umorismo nero, sketch comici musicali e satira.

Il tuo supporto ci renderà più liberi di sviluppare idee che sarebbero altrimenti fuori dalla nostra portata dal punto di vista finanziario. Inoltre saremmo in grado di creare un video promozionale di buona qualità e dei volantini che ci permettano di essere visibili tra la marea di spettacoli presenti al Fringe Festival.

<p></p>
<p>Ayúdanos a llevar nuestro espectáculo al Free Fringe Festival de Edimburgo
y seguir creando nuestra compañía: Ideas Worth a Penny.</p>
<p>Necesitamos tu ayuda para poder producir nuestro primer espectáculo, La Virgen
y el Cordero. Una obra donde María y Jesús son  satíricos personajes interpretados por  marginados de la sociedad, que sacrifican todo
por el sueño de volar con una compañía de bajo coste. Entretienen al público riéndose
de la sociedad mientras formulan la pregunta: ¿vale la pena sacrificar la vida
por lo que la sociedad dice que es justo y digno?</p>
<p>Nuestra nueva compañía, Ideas Worth a Penny, está compuesta por actores
internacionales que se formaron juntos en la Escuela de Philippe Gaulier en
Paris, Carmen Arquelladas (España), Simone Tani (Italia), Miwa Nagai (Japón) y
Duncan Cameron (Cánada) estamos interesados en tratar los temas a través de la técnica
del ¨Bouffon¨, que pone en duda lo que la sociedad da por sentado como búsqueda
de la felicidad, y da el punto de vista de los excluidos y marginados. Estos
personajes salen de las sombras en las que se les pidió estar para poner luz en
las verdades que fueron escondidas tras las mentiras que construyó la sociedad.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“La Virgen y el Cordero” es un espectáculo original y subversivo que combina
humor negro, sketch cómico y musicales con la sátira. Será presentado en el
Balham Fringe Festival y en el Free Fringe de Edimburgo.</p>

locales de ensayo, que nos ayudará a continuar con el desarrollo de nuestro
trabajo en un ambiente creativo. También nos permite aliviar la presión sobre

Edimburgo. Tu apoyo nos hará más libres para desarrollar ideas que de otra
manera estarían fuera de nuestro 
presupuesto. Además, nos gustaría ser capaces de crear un video
promocional de  buena calidad y los
folletos que nos permitan promocionar nuestro espectáculo entre toda la marea
de obras del Fringe Festival. Un buen paquete promocional nos abrirá las

compañías de teatro es un gran reto.</p>
<p>Con tu contribución nos ayudarás a dar voz a los marginados. </p>
<p>Nos gusta guiar al público por un viaje de dudas y preguntas sobre la
sociedad actual. Nos gusta mostrar como las personas consideradas como horribles
e indignas pueden mostrar la belleza de la humanidad. Cómo ven lo que se
considera importante para la vida y la felicidad. Cómo parodian estas creencias.</p>
<p>Nos dedicamos a la investigación que nos lleve a crear experiencias teatrales
que nos involucren, provoquen  y hagan
reír al público, pero al mismo tiempo creen una sensación de incomodidad  y un sentimiento de no ser inocente.
Exploramos temas sociales como el abuso de ancianos en las residencias, la
exclusión social de los homosexuales revenado la homofobia; el racismo
representado por las diferencias entre las distintas creencias culturales.</p>
<p>Dado que estos temas pueden ser muy arriesgados y duros, trabajamos con el humor
 a fin de realizar  escenas de apariencia ligera pero con unos conceptos
profundos. Estamos orgullosos de nuestro trabajo y esperamos contar con tu
apoyo para continuar con su desarrollo.</p>

Carmen Arquelladas(Spain), Simone Tani(Italy), Miwa Nagai(Japan) and Duncan Cameron (Canada) are interested with focusing on themes through Bouffon, which questions the importance of the mainstream belief of happiness, and gives a point of view to the outcasts and those who have been rejected from society. These people come back from their shadows to show us the truths in the lies that we build our lives upon. The Virgin and the Lamb, a highly original and subversive bouffon show combining darkly funny sketch with song, comedy and satire,  will be presented at the Balham Fringe Festival and at the Edinburgh Free Fringe Festival. The first showings of bits of our show in London has been very successful, we need your help to go further.With your funding you can help us to move our first steps as a company and take our work at the biggest theatre festival in Europe.What We Need & What You GetWe are raising £2,200 which constitutes a portion of the budget for our show. At the moment this production has been funded entirely by our sweat.Firstly, what we rise will go to rehearsal space, that will help us continue our work in a creative atmosphere. As well as taking the pressure off of our budget for costume and props, travel costs and accommodation in Edinburgh.  Your funding would give us more freedom to develop ideas that would have otherwise been out of our price range. We then would be able to look into the option of  creating a higher quality promotional video along with flyers that will aid us to be seen among the many other shows in Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Having a good promotional pack will open doors to future opportunities and help us grow as a company.Your help, is vital even a small donation can make a big difference.The ImpactWith your contribution you'll give legs to a brand new international theatre company. Your support is vital for us in this moment, because budget for brand new theatre companies is a great challenge. With your contribution you'll help us to give a voice to the societies rejects. We like to lead the audience through
a short journey of self doubt and questioning. Also showing them how
people regarded as awful, and not even worth the pity, can show the
beauty of humanity. How do they see what is regarded as important for
life and happiness?  How do they parody these beliefs?
We
are also looking to create theatrical experiences where we involve,
and arouse, laughing from the audience as well as a sickening feeling
that they are not innocent.  We explore themes such as the
maltreatment of elderly, by exposing care home abuse. Gay exclusion,
by revealing homophobia, and racism by presenting differences in
cultural beliefs.  As these themes can be quite risky and heavy, we
work a lot with humor to keep the scenes light in appearance but deep
in concept, this is something we are proud of and we hope to get your support to keep developing it. 
Other Ways You Can HelpHelp our voice reaching as many people as possible. This is also a concrete way you can contribute to this campaign. Please take a moment to share this campaign on Facebook, Twitter and all other social networks. Please invite your peers to donate and to watch the show. ITALIAN In breve
Aiutaci a portare il nostro spettacolo al Free Fringe Festival di Edimburgo ed ad avviare la nostra compagnia: Ideas Worth a Penny!Abbiamo bisogno del tuo aiuto per produrre il nostro primo spettacolo, ""The Virgin and the Lamb"" (La Vergine e l'Agnelllo), in cui Maria e Gesù sono due personaggi satirici, interpretati da due emarginati, che abbandonano tutto per il sogno di volare con una compagnia aerea low-cost. Intrattengono il pubblico prendendo in giro la società e ponendo la domanda: vale la pena di sacrificare la propria vita per seguire ciò che la società ci dice essere giusto e degno di valore?La nostra neonata compagnia, Ideas Worth a Penny, è composta da un cast internazionaleche si è formato a Parigi all scuola Ecole Philippe Gaulier: Carmen Arquelladas(Spagna), Simone Tani(Italia), Miwa Nagai(Giappone) e Duncan Cameron (Canada). Siamo interessati alle tematiche di solito affrontate con la tecnica del ""buffone"", che mette in discussione l'importanza di quanto dato per scontato dalla società come giusto da perseguire e fonte di felicità. Il buffone fornisce il punto di vista degli esclusi e degli emarginati. Questi personaggi escono dall'ombra, in cui sono invitati a stare, per metter in luce la verità tra le maglie  delle bugie su cui è costruita la nostra società.""The Virgin and the Lamb"", è uno spettacolo originale e sovversivo che combina umorismo nero, sketch comici musicali e satira. Sarà presentato in anteprima al Balham Fringe Festival a Londra ed al Free Fringe Festival di Edimburgo. Abbiamo mostrato alcune brevi parti dello spettacolo in diversi cabaret a Londra ed è stato un successo. Abbiamo bisogno del tuo aiuto per continuare e arricchire lo spettacolo di nuovi contenuti e presentarlo al più grande festival teatrale in Europa.Di cosa abbiamo bisogno ed i premi per te
Stiamo raccogliendo £2,200 che costituiscono parte degli investimenti necessari per portare lo spettacolo a Edimburgo. Al momento la produzione è stata finanziata con i nostri sacrifici e con il nostro lavoro.Quanto raccolto, come prima cosa andrà a finanziare il costo delle sale prove, per permetterci di continuare lo sviluppo dello spettacolo in un atmosfera creativa. Inoltre ci permetterà di allentare la pressione sul budget per i costumi e gli oggetti di scena, le spese di viaggio e alloggio a Edimburgo. Il tuo supporto ci renderà più liberi di sviluppare idee che sarebbero altrimenti fuori dalla nostra portata dal punto di vista finanziario. Inoltre saremmo in grado di creare un video promozionale di buona qualità e dei volantini che ci permettano di essere visibili tra la marea di spettacoli presenti al Fringe Festival. Un buon pacchetto promozionale ci aprirebbe le porte per accedere a opportunità future e ci permetterebbe di crescere come compagnia.Se doni riceverai un piccolo segno della nostra riconoscenza ecco la lista dei premi disponibili:- 5 sterline: Check-inUn sentito ringraziamento su  Facebook e Twitter.- 15 sterline: Allaccia le cintureSei un performer?

SPANISHBreve Resumen 


Ayúdanos a llevar nuestro espectáculo al Free Fringe Festival de Edimburgo
y seguir creando nuestra compañía: Ideas Worth a Penny.
Necesitamos tu ayuda para poder producir nuestro primer espectáculo, La Virgen
y el Cordero. Una obra donde María y Jesús son  satíricos personajes interpretados por  marginados de la sociedad, que sacrifican todo
por el sueño de volar con una compañía de bajo coste. Entretienen al público riéndose
de la sociedad mientras formulan la pregunta: ¿vale la pena sacrificar la vida
por lo que la sociedad dice que es justo y digno?
Nuestra nueva compañía, Ideas Worth a Penny, está compuesta por actores
internacionales que se formaron juntos en la Escuela de Philippe Gaulier en
Paris, Carmen Arquelladas (España), Simone Tani (Italia), Miwa Nagai (Japón) y
Duncan Cameron (Cánada) estamos interesados en tratar los temas a través de la técnica
del ¨Bouffon¨, que pone en duda lo que la sociedad da por sentado como búsqueda
de la felicidad, y da el punto de vista de los excluidos y marginados. Estos
personajes salen de las sombras en las que se les pidió estar para poner luz en
las verdades que fueron escondidas tras las mentiras que construyó la sociedad.

“La Virgen y el Cordero” es un espectáculo original y subversivo que combina
humor negro, sketch cómico y musicales con la sátira. Será presentado en el
Balham Fringe Festival y en el Free Fringe de Edimburgo.
Hemos representado partes del espectáculo en diferentes cabarets en Londres
y el resultado ha sido bastante satisfactorio. Necesitamos tu ayuda para
continuar y mejorar nuestro trabajo y llevarlo al festival más grande de teatro
de Europa.

manera estarían fuera de nuestro 
presupuesto. Además, nos gustaría ser capaces de crear un video
promocional de  buena calidad y los
folletos que nos permitan promocionar nuestro espectáculo entre toda la marea
de obras del Fringe Festival. Un buen paquete promocional nos abrirá las

El Impacto 


Con tu contribución nos estás ayudando a poner los pilares a nuestra nueva
e internacional compañía de teatro. Tu ayuda es vital para nosotros en este momento,
ya que conseguir  presupuesto para las nuevas
compañías de teatro es un gran reto.
Con tu contribución nos ayudarás a dar voz a los marginados. 
Nos gusta guiar al público por un viaje de dudas y preguntas sobre la
sociedad actual. Nos gusta mostrar como las personas consideradas como horribles
e indignas pueden mostrar la belleza de la humanidad. Cómo ven lo que se
considera importante para la vida y la felicidad. Cómo parodian estas creencias.
Nos dedicamos a la investigación que nos lleve a crear experiencias teatrales
que nos involucren, provoquen  y hagan
reír al público, pero al mismo tiempo creen una sensación de incomodidad  y un sentimiento de no ser inocente.
Exploramos temas sociales como el abuso de ancianos en las residencias, la
exclusión social de los homosexuales revenado la homofobia; el racismo
representado por las diferencias entre las distintas creencias culturales.
Dado que estos temas pueden ser muy arriesgados y duros, trabajamos con el humor
 a fin de realizar  escenas de apariencia ligera pero con unos conceptos
profundos. Estamos orgullosos de nuestro trabajo y esperamos contar con tu
apoyo para continuar con su desarrollo.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>After meeting and working together at NYU and the Stella Adler Studio, Stacy Osei-Kuffour and Michael Sutherland have continued the partnership by producing, co-directing and performing Stacy's original plays.  We have strived to perform work with socially relevant ideas, and the plays have looked at themes of race and gender identity and serve to really put out important and provocative thoughts.  The most recent project, The Painter, was a finalist in the 2011 Samuel French OOB festival, (13 out 1000+) which Exeunt magazine called ""a powerful and suspenseful drama""  (7/27/11).  Previous work together includes an earlier workshop of Breathless at the Downtown Urban Theater Festival, The Painter at the Strawberry Festival, a reading of Red Red with On the Square Productions, and In the Evening at the Stella Adler Studio.  </p>

It was founded in 2009 by four long- term friends, most of whom met at the Ailey School over twenty years ago. Three of the women are over forty, one is over thirty, all are of culturally diverse backgrounds, have danced professionally in either New York or Northern California throughout their careers, and continue to teach and perform.  We seek to bridge the older generation with the younger generation, and the usually ""non dance attending"" audience with concert dance, in order to pass on both artistic and cultural knowledge.</span></p>

<p>We are a theatre company entering our seventh season. Our work explores the diverse life of our city and attempts to tell the Chicago story from as many perspectives as possible. Since 2007, our sixteen productions have been seen by 12,000 audience members, been nominated for 3 Jeff Awards and 2 Black Theatre Alliance Awards and earned the company the 2012 Emerging Theatre Award from Broadway in Chicago.</p>
<h3><strong> </strong></h3>
<h2><strong>I Am An Artist</strong></h2>
<p>Theatre Seven's extended family of artists represents a diverse, talented community of over 250 of Chicago's best and brightest theatrical artists. This summer, we gathered some of our favorite collaborators to talk about their lives, their hopes, their crafts, their dreams. This project is the result of those conversations - a campaign to honor, celebrate, and continue supporting the brilliant array of artists that work on our stages.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What is Artist-Supportive?</h2>
<p>What does it mean when we say we believe in creating artist-supportive experiences? It means we believe artists deserve to be paid for their work. It means we believe artists succeed when an institution has the time and resources to fully support their efforts. It means we believe that if Chicago's best young actors, directors and designers are given a safe space, the right tools, and as much compensation as we afford to offer...magical things will happen. And Chicago will benefit.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Why Now?</h2>
<p>As we approach the end of our fiscal year (Aug 31), we want to finish the year strong to ensure we can continue supporting artists to the degree we have in past years. In 2012-13, we undertake an ambitious four production season, which will include a production at the Steppenwolf Garage and a year-long short play festival about extraordinary Chicago women. It is important that we finish this fiscal year strong so that, in planning for future seasons, we are able to continue offering the utmost support to the artists whose work brings our visions to life.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What's In It For You</h2>
<p>Donations of any size come with cool perks, anything from a personalized Facebook status to a subscription for 2 to our ridiculously awesome upcoming season. But the most important thing you get with a donation is knowing that YOU helped support artists today. When you donate to Theatre Seven, you can be assured that every dollar goes to support an organization that is shaping the future of Chicago theatre, by both supporting the city's finest artists and bringing their work to life.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Nuts and Bolts</strong></h2>
<p>Theatre Seven IS a 501(c)3 charity in the state of Illinois. Every donation to thsi campaign is tax-deductible in accordance with the laws where you maintain residence, and will be issued a written thank you within a month of donation and a year end tax receipt from Theatre Seven.</p>

<h3>Hello puppet pals,</h3>
<p>Michael Rosenbaum here, creator of the puppet improv group<a href=""http://puppetmayhem.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> “Puppet Mayhem”</a>, which is an Improv show with a kid’s show format, but for adults (like avenue Q). There are puppets and humans interacting with each other. Teaching life lessons, learning the letter of the day, how to count, singing songs, and meeting special guests in the same cheery demeanor as Sesame Street, but geared towards adults.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why we need your help</h3>
<p>Puppet mayhem has entered into the <a href=""http://www.hollywoodfringe.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hollywood fringe festival</a>, which is an exciting festival held every year in june to celebrate the performing arts.</p>

</div></div>","Hello puppet pals,
Michael Rosenbaum here, creator of the puppet improv group “Puppet Mayhem”, which is an Improv show with a kid’s show format, but for adults (like avenue Q). There are puppets and humans interacting with each other. Teaching life lessons, learning the letter of the day, how to count, singing songs, and meeting special guests in the same cheery demeanor as Sesame Street, but geared towards adults.

$20 gets you a cartoon of yourself in puppet form.

<p><strong>About Recovery</strong></p>
<p>Ten years ago, I started writing a play about two people I'd met while undergoing treatment for leukemia.

<strong>DiMay</strong> <strong>Productions</strong> is a multiplatform production company created by <strong><em>DI</em></strong>ana Sanchez and <strong><em>MAY</em></strong>lin Castro, which promotes multimedia projects that are Bold, Innovative and outside the box.

<div>
<p>It is our deeply held belief to give power back to the artist. We believe that all artists should have a say in what they put out into the world, and this is what DiMay is all about. We each have a journey which is colored by our ideals and beliefs.</p>
<p>We see what is being fed to us in the industry and DiMay Productions is taking a stand by having an inclusive casting process, what we want to see is what we see out in the real world all colors, all backgrounds, all faiths interconnected beyond stereotypes, and ""ideas"", but rather an interconnectedness, within these human stories.</p>

My name is Ben King and I am a contemporary dancer. I have been given the opportunity to train at <strong>Trinity Laban Conservatoire for Music and Dance</strong>, an internationally established conservatoire that trains contemporary dancers to the highest level.</p>
<p>The last 3 years of my life have been focused on becoming a professional dancer. Having NO contemporary dance experience I auditioned for Northern School of Contemporary Dance, I was unsuccessful. So for a year I worked in a bar and spent my free time developing my abilities when I successfully auditioned for a place at The Scottish School of Contemporary Dance. I have been training here for 2 years and with only £3500 of support from Student Finance England over the full two years, I have worked to support myself and pay my tuition fees. I have worked incredibly hard to develop myself as a dancer and want to continue this in London.</p>
<p>I want to study at <strong>Trinity Laban</strong> because it holds a WORLD CLASS reputation for training professional dancers. The school is multicultural with students from all over the world travelling to be part of it. The <strong>BA (hons) Contemporary Dance</strong> course has some of the leading lecturers in the country. I will be able to learn a lot from these teachers and their wealth of experience will help me to become a strong and versatile dancer.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>We are a new theater company in Los Angeles, and have decided to start off with a bang by doing RENT, by Jonathan Larson. This piece won a Tony Award for Best Musical in 1996, and was groundbreaking and ""the first of its kind"", when it hit the stage. We decided to make RENT our first official Mainstage Production, because it has had a massive and personal impact on so many people. The late Jonathan Larson wrote it to bring light to the AIDS epidemic that was so prominent in New York in the 80's, and to tell the stories of struggling yet passionate artists, many of whom were outcasts in one way or another. Most people who see this show, see a version of themselves in at least one of the very colorful characters in this ensemble piece. Everyone in our company and cast is passionate about this piece, and we hope you will be too!</p>
<p>We have also established partnerships with AIDS Project LA (APLA), Being Alive, and AIDS Research Alliance (ARA), which are all local organizations that provide AIDS research and support, and we are working on a few more local partnerships, where some proceeds from our ticket sales will go to supporting those causes. RENT is a massive undertaking because it demands high quality in sound equipment, set design and construction, costumes and props, lighting design and equipment, music, etc., and we are determined to bring Jonathan Larson's story to life thoroughly and completely!</p>
<p>We are also putting up a second production that will run simultaneously, twice a week, during the run of RENT. That production is going to be Steven Dietz's PRIVATE EYES. This is a very intelligent, hilarious, dark comedy that will run on Thursday nights and Saturday matinees, every week that RENT is running, as a sister-production.</p>
<p>Therefore, we are doing a three-part <span class=""il"">indiegogo</span> campaign, and there will be special perks for donating to all three campaigns. This is the first leg, and we are looking to raise $2000 for our initial production costs, i.e. theater rental, royalties, and paying our top-notch production staff. But let's try and surpass that, and get our next two campaigns going before they even start! Any and all contributions are much appreciated, and there will be perks like free tickets to the shows, and some to our opening night reception and gala, free refreshments at the theater, posters and programs signed by the cast, tickets to our fall show, and even getting your name spray painted on our set!</p>
<p>If we do not make our goal, a larger portion of what we do raise is witheld from us, so it's very important that we reach it! If it is not possible for you to contribute, you can still help us by spreading the word. Sharing this event on Facebook, twitter, and telling your community about us in whatever way you can, helps out too! </p>
<p>Plese check out our website at <a href=""http://www.kboulepictures.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.kboulepictures.com</a> to read reviews of our last show, <em>The Last Five Years</em>, and to find out more about our company.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>7 Potencias presents a rich and vibrant culture from the lesser known part of eastern Cuba, known in Cuba as the Oriente.<br/></p>
<p><b>7 Potencias is a music and dance troupe based in Cuba!</b></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<div>
<p>This will be our first ever U.S. appearance! 7 Potencias will be arriving on November 10, 2013 to the U.S. for a series of workshops and performances in preparation for the 15th anniversary of the company. We want to showcase our work that spans across the years. This series of workshops and performances will be for a month in the San Francisco Bay Area. </p>
<p> 7 Potencias is unique in that it is able to present authentic folkloric traditions. Many of its members are descendants of immigrants from Haiti, Jamaica, and other Caribbean islands which informs their work. Putting this investigative work on stage and highlighting the stories learned from family members makes it one of the more reliable groups presenting this lesser known Cuban folklore. </p>
<p> 7 Potencias was founded by close friends who all grew up in the same small city in the Oriente (Eastern) part of Cuba and studied together at performing arts schools and universities in Oriente and Havana. This close-knit group of musicians and dancers had been a part of many other dance troupes and participated in numerous national and international events and festivals. We decided to share our love of Afro-Cuban traditions and especially the lesser-known Oreinte traditions with wider audiences.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
</div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We need funds to cover initial costs of the flights, visas, accommodations and costumes for the members of 7 Potencias. We want to expand their work and share it with wider audiences.</p>
<p>Reaching the $12,000 goal will help to cover the initial production costs of 7 Potencias' U.S tour 2013. This will be a great start in funding the entire cost of putting on this U.S. premiere tour of 7 Potencias.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>
<p>In 2003, I began the endeavor to bring 7 Potencias to perform in the U.S. At that time, because of the regulations and the papers needed between countries, we got the U.S. permits, but not the Cuba permits on time. The following 5 years no Cuban groups were coming into the U.S at all. In 2009 I tried again, and was able to get the U.S. permits, but the Cuban permits were delayed.</p>
<p>NOW WE’RE READY! This year we re-applied and we have permits from both countries and that is why we are asking for your help to make this dream project a reality.</p>
<p>This is the dream of the last 10 years that we never gave up on. We need more dance companies like this that do investigative work and research in order to go beyond the popular and share their cultural heritage and roots on stage.</p>

<p><span>Wow! We reached our production goal of $1,000 in under 2 weeks. THAT'S INCREDIBLE! We are so floored by the generosity of our
community. So we thought, since we have two weeks left at Indiegogo, let's give back to the community. We are now endeavoring to raise another $300 for charity! </span></p>

<p>R I B S is teaming up with Girls Inc. NYC - a non-for-profit
dedicated to celebrating and supporting young women across the five boroughs —
to bring high school girls to the show, free of charge. This is a show for

<p><b>SO THE STORY GOES</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Hello! We're the cast and creative team of R I B S, a new poetic-theatre piece that explores women's relationships with beauty and the body.</p>
<p></p>
</div><div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">What does it mean for women to shrink in this world, contort themselves to impossible and pervasive standards? How do we celebrate the resiliency of (all) women? </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Since 2013, the playwright, Geneviève Beaudoin, has been interviewing women in New York City about beauty. These words have transformed into the poetry project known today as R I B S - a play that continues to be workshopped through performance. </span>
</div><div><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div><p><span><b>HERE’S WHERE YOU COME IN</b></span></p><p>R I B S  will perform at Planet Connections Theatre Festivity this June. We are producing the show without the financial help of an existing theatre company, which is why we need your help to make it happen.</p><p>Here's where your support goes:</p><ul><li><p>Precious real estate aka REHEARSAL SPACE  in the city</p></li></ul><ul>
<li><p>Professional photo and video documentation (check out the great team at <a href=""http://www.sub-urbanphotography.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sub/Urban Photography</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>General production costs</p></li>
<li><p>Printing scripts &amp; festival posters</p></li>
<li><p>And most importantly, artist stipends</p></li>
</ul><p>While this is a passion project for so many of us, we believe artists should be paid for their work and we want to extend a gesture to our cast and crew. Your contribution will help us pay our actors, musicians, audio engineer, lighting designer and board op., stage manager, etc.</p><p>And once you donate, we won’t leave you in the dark. We’ll be posting photo and video updates each week -- showing you what we’re up to in rehearsals. </p><div>
<h3></h3>
<p><span><b>WTF IS THAT RIB NOW?</b></span></p>
<p>R I B S believes there is power in sharing stories -- with humor and heart and all the messy contradictions of being human. </p>
<p>These stories are born of particulars and aren’t meant to represent the full spectrum. We welcome the stories still yet to be heard, and those who own them.</p>

Wow! We reached our production goal of $1,000 in under 2 weeks. THAT'S INCREDIBLE! We are so floored by the generosity of our
community. So we thought, since we have two weeks left at Indiegogo, let's give back to the community. We are now endeavoring to raise another $300 for charity! 


R I B S is teaming up with Girls Inc. NYC - a non-for-profit
dedicated to celebrating and supporting young women across the five boroughs —
to bring high school girls to the show, free of charge. This is a show for
them. Help us make it happen! 
More info about Girls, Inc. NYC here:

SO THE STORY GOES

Hello! We're the cast and creative team of R I B S, a new poetic-theatre piece that explores women's relationships with beauty and the body.


What does it mean for women to shrink in this world, contort themselves to impossible and pervasive standards? How do we celebrate the resiliency of (all) women? Since 2013, the playwright, Geneviève Beaudoin, has been interviewing women in New York City about beauty. These words have transformed into the poetry project known today as R I B S - a play that continues to be workshopped through performance. 
HERE’S WHERE YOU COME INR I B S  will perform at Planet Connections Theatre Festivity this June. We are producing the show without the financial help of an existing theatre company, which is why we need your help to make it happen.Here's where your support goes:Precious real estate aka REHEARSAL SPACE  in the city
Professional photo and video documentation (check out the great team at Sub/Urban Photography)
General production costs
Printing scripts & festival posters
And most importantly, artist stipends
While this is a passion project for so many of us, we believe artists should be paid for their work and we want to extend a gesture to our cast and crew. Your contribution will help us pay our actors, musicians, audio engineer, lighting designer and board op., stage manager, etc.And once you donate, we won’t leave you in the dark. We’ll be posting photo and video updates each week -- showing you what we’re up to in rehearsals. 

WTF IS THAT RIB NOW?
R I B S believes there is power in sharing stories -- with humor and heart and all the messy contradictions of being human. 
These stories are born of particulars and aren’t meant to represent the full spectrum. We welcome the stories still yet to be heard, and those who own them.
Please consider joining us in the conversation. A donation of any kind will go far in supporting R I B S and bringing the kind of discussion it begs one step closer to our communities. Thank you.

<h2>The Story</h2>
<p>On September 23 and 24 I will be premiering <strong>""Solo un poco,""</strong> a solo choreographed by <strong>Idan Sharabi</strong> for <strong>2015 McKnight Dance Fellow, Alanna Morris-Van Tassel</strong>, at the <strong>Cowles Center</strong> in Minneapolis as apart of the McKnight SOLO concert.  The first phase of the creative process was completed in New York in June 2016 with the support of the McKnight Dancers Fellowship.</p>
<p><strong>An Israeli-based choreographer, your contribution covers the cost of Idan's flight from Tel Aviv to Minneapolis, applicable transfer fees, and his travel expenses for the tech week and premiere. Being able to bring him to the States in September means we can successfully complete this project, marking a significant milestone in my career!</strong></p>
<p>""Solo un poco"" embodies the practice of being in the ""now,"" or the present moment.  Through Idan's movement language, I enjoy and play with time, stretching and capturing the moment, finding limilitess potential in dissonnace and intensity.  Working one-on-one is an exceptional opportunity for artistic growth.  It is empowering and challenging and causes us to discover more about our own power and potential.  </p>
<p>The McKnight Dancers Fellowship is a recognition of artistic excellence for mid-career dancers in Minnesota. Three dancers are awarded fellowships each year and are given the opportunity to perform a commissioned solo from a choreographer of their choice.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Risks and Challenges</h2>
<p>It takes a lot of effort to bring an international choreographer to the States and is very costly.  McKnight Dance Fellows often choose local or national artists for that reason.  On occasion, but rarely, an international choreographer is not able to come for the SOLO tech week/premiere; and it places a lot of responsibility on the dancer to see the work through to opening night. </p>
<p>""Solo un poco."" is a NEW creation and currently a work-in-progress.  Idan's presence in Minneapolis would be best to finalize the work, as it relates to technical, theatrical, and artistic decisions. </p>
<p>This will be an extraordinary occasion for the Twin Cities dance community to build connections with a well-known, emerging voice of contemporary dance.  Public talks with the choreographer will be held at the Cowles Center on Tuesday 9/20 and as Friday 9/23.  Additionally, there will be a  reception post-performance on Friday 9/23.</p>

It was labeled, by elder critics, as being „outrageous”, „obscene”, „vulgar”. At the same time the play has been widely acknowledged by theatre professionals, who saw it as a rebirth of new Romanian playwriting. The text deals with language, Romanian (and global) hypocrisy, and a form of updated, post-modern existentialism in a hyper ironic way, that’s both challenging and guilty pleasure fun. Nevertheless, the play is an unconventional plea for happiness. For six years it was a taboo to stage this play in Romania, although it won one of the most important new playwriting awards (dramAcum, 2002) and was presented in highly acknowledged festivals such as The New Writing Bienalle in Wiesbaden, Germany (2006). In 2008 the MONDAY Theatre @ Green Hours (</span><span style="""">probably THE place to go if you want to see the most exciting indie/off theatre productions in Romania) </span><span style="""">dared to produce it, under the stage direction of the author himself. Ever since, the show has been a sold out hit, in its’ Romanian version. In 2011 Peca, an internationally acclaimed playwright (Juilliard Finalist 2010, one of the 5 Authors in the Berliner Stuckemarkt 2010 (Germany), Winner of Heidelberg’s Stuckemarkt Innovation Award 20007 (Germany)), has rewritten the play so we can share the performance with international audiences (both in Bucharest and abroad). Nils’ Fucked Up Day (the new English title) is now a mix of Romanian and English, powered by one of the best VJ’s in Romania (CINTY) combining multimedia, interactivity and a very inciting way to look at the world and its stereotypes. </span></p><p></p></span><p></p>

The performaces will take place at Dixon Place Theatre, in the Lower East Side. To get six performers from Eastern Europe to New York is a costly, difficult challenge. There are VISA and work permit expenses, accomodation and travel expenses that are much higher than for a local company. Though we had the most difficult part covered (the plane tickets and accomodation for 5 of the performers), through the very generous support of the Romanian Cultural Institute in New York - we are still missing 6000 dollars for the other expenses - such as accomodation for the rest of the team, hiring a local light board operator, and minimum perdiems. As you all know - New York is not the cheapest place in the world and through this campaign we are only aiming to cover the minimum, decent costs of living of 6 performers in the Big Apple for the month of August.</span></p>

<p style=""""><strong></strong> </p>
<div>
<p>The money goes to partial accomodation of 3 members of our team (the others will be staying at the RCI NY) local transportation (6 30 day Metro Cards for the performers), hiring a local board operator (which is extremely important for the show), building a wood pannel necessary for the set, paying the venue director (the person that takes care of our set), consumable props (used in the play - we can't get them from Bucharest), the participant's Festival fee (which is 600 dollars per company) and a small amount of pocket money for each actor. All of this is very likely to go over 6000 dollars but we are trying to be as realistic and economic as possible. We are trying to fundraise from other sources, and we do have the support of the Romanian Cultural Institute in NY (they covered our plane tickets and part of the accomodation) but each cent in this campaign will help the show happen in its best format. </p>

Share this campaign - you can share it on Facebook, Twitter, post the You Tube clips - spread the word as much as possible.

It's fun, fresh, and something they don't get to see for the rest of the year on the NY theatre scene.</p>

The text deals with language, Romanian (and global) hypocrisy, and a form of updated, post-modern existentialism in a hyper ironic way, that’s both challenging and guilty pleasure fun. Nevertheless, the play is an unconventional plea for happiness. For six years it was a taboo to stage this play in Romania, although it won one of the most important new playwriting awards (dramAcum, 2002) and was presented in highly acknowledged festivals such as The New Writing Bienalle in Wiesbaden, Germany (2006). In 2008 the MONDAY Theatre @ Green Hours (probably THE place to go if you want to see the most exciting indie/off theatre productions in Romania) dared to produce it, under the stage direction of the author himself. Ever since, the show has been a sold out hit, in its’ Romanian version. In 2011 Peca, an internationally acclaimed playwright (Juilliard Finalist 2010, one of the 5 Authors in the Berliner Stuckemarkt 2010 (Germany), Winner of Heidelberg’s Stuckemarkt Innovation Award 20007 (Germany)), has rewritten the play so we can share the performance with international audiences (both in Bucharest and abroad). Nils’ Fucked Up Day (the new English title) is now a mix of Romanian and English, powered by one of the best VJ’s in Romania (CINTY) combining multimedia, interactivity and a very inciting way to look at the world and its stereotypes. 
The cast is made up of 5 of the best young actors in Bucharest, in the tradition of the MONDAY Theatre. Some of them have been in the films of the new wave in Romanian cinema. (You can watch them here in our teasers for this campaign: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yY42FIlW-c)
The show was selected in this year's edition of the FringeNYC and now the company needs to go to New York City in August and present this innovative story to New York audiences. The performaces will take place at Dixon Place Theatre, in the Lower East Side. To get six performers from Eastern Europe to New York is a costly, difficult challenge. There are VISA and work permit expenses, accomodation and travel expenses that are much higher than for a local company. Though we had the most difficult part covered (the plane tickets and accomodation for 5 of the performers), through the very generous support of the Romanian Cultural Institute in New York - we are still missing 6000 dollars for the other expenses - such as accomodation for the rest of the team, hiring a local light board operator, and minimum perdiems. As you all know - New York is not the cheapest place in the world and through this campaign we are only aiming to cover the minimum, decent costs of living of 6 performers in the Big Apple for the month of August.
The Impact
“Nils’ Fucked Up Day” by Peca Ştefan isan introduction to Postmodern Trash Punk Existentialism in Ro-English, which we think is a deeply original format. We have 5 scheduled performances in New York City at Dixon Place in August as follows: SUN 14 @ 4:15; MON 15 @ 7; THU 18 @ 7:45; SAT 20 @ 4:15; MON 22 @ 3:45.
We hope to have as many New Yorkers as possible being introduced to the best quality indie theatre in Romania (which is not at all present on the NY theatre scene). As a spinoff to the play we want to make a vlog and a YouTube series about the adventures of these Romanian actors in NYC - all of them will be there for the first time in their life - which is quite a culture clash. It's not Borat - it's real!
 
What We Need & What You Get
 

The money goes to partial accomodation of 3 members of our team (the others will be staying at the RCI NY) local transportation (6 30 day Metro Cards for the performers), hiring a local board operator (which is extremely important for the show), building a wood pannel necessary for the set, paying the venue director (the person that takes care of our set), consumable props (used in the play - we can't get them from Bucharest), the participant's Festival fee (which is 600 dollars per company) and a small amount of pocket money for each actor. All of this is very likely to go over 6000 dollars but we are trying to be as realistic and economic as possible. We are trying to fundraise from other sources, and we do have the support of the Romanian Cultural Institute in NY (they covered our plane tickets and part of the accomodation) but each cent in this campaign will help the show happen in its best format. 
We are offering a mention for each 15$ donor on our website as ""Friends of Nils"". For each 60$ donation you get mentioned on our YouTube series and on our website as ""Nils' room mate"". For a 100$ donation you get metioned on our website, series and printed programme as ""Nils' landlord"". For a donation between 200$ - 500$ you get to be ""Nils' building owner"", get all a landlord gets plus free tickets to the show (from 2 to 5, according to your donation). For donations $600 and above you get on our poster, series, website and 6 free tickets as ""Nils' Zone Master""... and free accomodation for when you'll be in Bucharest Romania (for 1000$ and up):) 


Other Ways You Can Help
Even if you don't have the possibility of financially helping our trip to NYC, there are others way you can help. Share this campaign - you can share it on Facebook, Twitter, post the You Tube clips - spread the word as much as possible. And if in New York City - tell your friends, boyfriends and girlfriends, work mates and generally everyone you know:) that they're welcome to this very special show from Romania, performed in Ro-English. It's fun, fresh, and something they don't get to see for the rest of the year on the NY theatre scene.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>The Rage of the Stage Players are currently attempting to raise $1,800 to produce the world premiere of James Michael Shoberg’s latest stage adaptation, <em>Hooked</em>. It is a grim, violent twist on J. M. Barrie’s novel, <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Peter and Wendy</span>, set in a future London, overwrought with crime and drugs, where societal decay has left the city a ruined husk of what it once was. When an injured young punk, referring to himself only as ""Pan,"" crosses paths with a girl named Wendy Darling, she and her two brothers, John and Michael, are drawn deep into the heart of the city, where even the junkies, prostitutes, gangs, and piratical thugs have something to fear...a disfigured drug lord named James...better known on the streets as ""Hook.""</p>

<p>Your gift will allow The Rage of the Stage Players to proceed with our plans for our upcoming Fall 2012 season. It will allow Western Pennsylvanians to see new and extremely visceral theatre, and allow actors and production crew to continue to practice and share their work with audiences. All gifts are <strong>tax-deductible</strong> to the full extent of the law. Every gift is deeply appreciated and makes a huge difference. </p>

<h2><strong>Who We Are</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>The Rage of the Stage Players are a not-for-profit fringe theatre group that produces original works, with predominantly dark and mature themes. We are, in fact, the only group in Western Pennsylvania that performs such material not merely as seasonal Halloween fare…but instead, as the core of our company’s productions. The Rage of the Stage Players extend the opportunity to any student (18 years of age and older) or adult in the community, who wishes to apply an artistic skill in a theatrical setting. We strive to satisfy darker tastes in art, and thusly, have developed a fan-base composed of those who seek it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em><strong>When I was traveling from West Chester to work with Rage, I was commuting about 350 miles. There are a lot of reasons that I was willing to do this, but two were most prominent. Firstly, it was the most fun I’ve consistently had to this day. The people I met through Rage quickly became, and still are, some of my closest friends. And secondly, our shows were fantastic. The attention to detail in the scripts, costumes, set designs, props, etc., made it feel like a different world. I was excited for every show to go up, because I was proud of all the things we did. I couldn’t wait for my friends and family to see what we had been creating.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>-Sean Michael Gallaher, Actor</strong></em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em><strong>I keep coming to Rage performances because the company never fails to deliver creative, witty, edgy and delightfully deviant theater.  It makes me smile and shake my head at the same time, with its unique twists on familiar stories and hilarious takes on the darkest sides of life.  It's entertaining in the most inappropriate ways, and I really love that.</strong></em></p>

<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em><strong>When I returned to Pittsburgh after ten years, I had been annihilated by “Annie,” beaten by Beckett, shaken from Shakespeare, and rocked from “The Rocky Horror Show.” I wanted something fringe, frightening, and fresh. I chose The Rage of the Stage Players and luckily, they chose me, too.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>-Lori Howsare, Actress/Artistic Director of One Mom Productions</strong></em></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><strong>Rage has made every mile I traveled worth it. There is simply no other theatre company that puts such immense detail, not only into the original writing, but into creating the magical world, which appears on that page. Every stroke of makeup, fabric of a costume, and board of scenery is so beautifully crafted, that there is no other comparable theatre experience. You aren’t just acting in a play…you are, for at least a brief period, living in this fantastical world of make-believe.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>-Alyssa Herron, Actress</strong></em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em><strong>I started working with Rage because of the intense creativity and passion that they put into every show. I'm a traditionally and classically trained actor and a lot of that training can make us complacent and a little stale as artists. Rage challenges me to think differently and to use my skills in new and unusual ways. It's just a lot of fun!</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>-Dek Ingraham, Actor/Managing Artistic Director of Phase 3 Productions</strong></em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><strong><em>Rage consistently promises visually and emotionally engaging productions. Having known the Founders/Producers for man</em><em>y years, I hold them to that promise.  While other theatre groups may fall short, Rage never fails to draw me in, while immersing me in their twisted, dark,</em><em> and humorous world.  Having personally been able to participate in one of their shows (even in a small capacity), I can say their level of professionalism and dedication to the craft is fantastic. Not to mention, the experience was a </em><em>lot of fun as well! A few years ago I moved away from Pittsburgh. However, I still make every attempt to return home and catch one of Rage's new productions. Recently I flew home from Florida to attend their production of ""The Ha</em><em>miltons,"" and was blown away, as usual. I will continue to support Rage in the future and am proud to tell people about the great work Jim and Carrie do. I am looking forward to the next time I can escape for a few hours, forget about life's troubles and enjoy the show.</em></strong></p>

<p>James Michael and Carrie L. Shoberg co-founded The Rage of the Stage Players in 2001. Our independent group is comprised of fringe artists, who travel long distances from within Pennsylvania and the Tri-state area to work with us. Lovers of our unique brand of theatre, these artists volunteer hundreds of hours to making The Rage of the Stage Players a success. They appreciate the opportunity to hone their various talents in a theatrical setting. This is best illustrated in the case of The Rage of the Stage Players’ makeup and special effects designer, Greg Lightner, another of our volunteers, who was recently chosen to compete on the second season of  the SyFy Channel’s makeup/special effects reality show, “Face Off.”</p>

<p><em><strong>I really have to thank Jim Shoberg, personally, for believing in me, and coming up with these amazing concepts for Rage. I was really only ever an instrument, a medium to realize his vision. In the end, it was Jim, who was muse to me, and inspired every creation.

<p>Throughout the company’s ten-year history, most of the productions have been original works conceived by Co-Executive Producer and Artistic Director, James Michael Shoberg.  We have, however, had the occasion and privilege to debut the writing of other local playwrights, as well. This past fall, James received permission fromThe Butcher Brothers and Lionsgate Films, to adapt their award-winning, independent horror film, <em>The Hamiltons</em>, into a live stage play. The Rage of the Stage Players overwhelmingly well-received production of <em>The Hamiltons</em> was featured in Fangoria.com, Pittsburgh Exhumed, Pittsburgh Magazine, and Rue Morgue Magazine. (See <strong>Recent Media Coverage</strong> below.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Additionally, The Rage of the Stage Players are an annual participant in The Pittsburgh New Works Festival, the only one-act play festival of its kind, helping other playwrights to improve their plays through the process of a first full production. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>We Need Your Help</strong></h2>
<p>The Rage of the Stage Players, supported solely from ticket sales and individual donations since our inception in 2001, have never received grant money.  Ticket sales cover only 25% of our costs.  We depend on people just like you to donate the rest of the money to help us bring our vision of theatre to the stage. Our seasons are comprised of two shows, one in the spring and one in the fall. Monies made from each production are used to mount the next, with the success of each, determining the scale of the one to follow. The actors and production crew work on a strictly-voluntary basis, donating both time and talent. Though we’ve proceeded independently without significant outside financial support over the past ten years, The Rage of the Stage Players are now in need of funding to continue creating a brand of theatre that is uniquely our own. That is why we are embarking on our first large fundraising campaign. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>PurpleCoat Productions are a rising theatre and film group based in Liverpool and have been developing for the past four years. Our work has gained us the thumbs up from the likes of Stephen Fry, Sir Ian McKellen and Richard Wilson. We are now being recognised by some of the top players in theatre.</p>
<p>Firstly, we have been invited to perform as part of the 2012 International Youth Arts Festival. Companies come from across the globe in a huge celebration of theatre across two weeks in Kingston, London. Our production of Romeo and Juliet is booked as one of the headline acts at the 900 seat Rose Theatre. Judi Dench recently performed A Midsummer Nights Dream there. In addition, we have been selected by the Royal Shakespeare Company to perform A Midsummer Nights Dream and, with your support, Titus Andronicus at their venues in Stratford.</p>
<p>This is a massive opportunity for us. We have been working relentlessly towards this for the past four years. Now that we are beginning to be recognised we are hoping for all the support that we can get. These shows have been performed in Liverpool by us to rave reviews and now we want to showcase our talent on a bigger scale. This is where we need your help.

Short Summary
PurpleCoat Productions are a rising theatre and film group based in Liverpool and have been developing for the past four years. Our work has gained us the thumbs up from the likes of Stephen Fry, Sir Ian McKellen and Richard Wilson. We are now being recognised by some of the top players in theatre.
Firstly, we have been invited to perform as part of the 2012 International Youth Arts Festival. Companies come from across the globe in a huge celebration of theatre across two weeks in Kingston, London. Our production of Romeo and Juliet is booked as one of the headline acts at the 900 seat Rose Theatre. Judi Dench recently performed A Midsummer Nights Dream there. In addition, we have been selected by the Royal Shakespeare Company to perform A Midsummer Nights Dream and, with your support, Titus Andronicus at their venues in Stratford.
This is a massive opportunity for us. We have been working relentlessly towards this for the past four years. Now that we are beginning to be recognised we are hoping for all the support that we can get. These shows have been performed in Liverpool by us to rave reviews and now we want to showcase our talent on a bigger scale. This is where we need your help. To put on these shows requires us to cover costs including rehearsal space, props, set and costume. Although we will invest as much as we can into the productions, any financial support gained would help massively.
'They are clearly onto a winner with the cast of talent on view.'

<h3>IMPRO 2012: Die Gorillas' improv festival in Berlin<br/>
</h3>
<p>The festival ""IMPRO"" is THE international happening for improvised theater in Berlin, Germany. Since 2001 the Berlin based ensemble ""Die Gorillas"" is hosting this big annual festival. For the 2012 edition, we have invited 35 artists from 12 countries to perform, teach and learn in Berlin. The festival takes place from march 23rd till april 1st with several (parallel) daily shows. Since its beginnings, IMPRO has aimed to bring amazing performers together to develop new forms of improvisational theatre and to have people from all over the world get (to work) together, inspire each other and develop the art form of improv theatre. First and foremost, IMPRO is a ten days-festival for the audience, that gets to choose from a variety of 30 shows that present improv theater in all its aspects: the funny and the dark, the absurd and the emotional, the old and the new - thats why the slogan for our next festival is: Improv can do anything!</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need your support to close the gap in our budget. We are facing rising costs in e.g. board and lodging for our artists, while we're still not able to pay ourselves or the artists for performing here. We do not get funding for this festival, it is mainly financed by ticketing, workshops and small allocations by some embassy or small companies. We have been hosting this festival with a lot of enthusiasm, passion and
 gratefulness in the previous years. With your help, we can keep up the 
festival in its size and internationality. We would like to do so to 
keep this festival as an inspiration for both our artists and audience, a highlight of the year.<br/>
IMPRO was and is a festival that wants to live the close contact between
 audience and artist. In supporting the festival beyond seeing a show 
(hey, come see shows at the festival!), you can help to keep this idea 
alive and be a part of IMPRO 2012 for example by coming to the BIF days,

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><i>Two Days 'til Dawn</i> will be having it's World Premiere at the Gene Frankel Theatre, NYC. Tragic, Beautiful and Dream-like, this play will take you on a psychological roller-coaster.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Open Lab Collective is going to be running a production of Tyler Ham Pong's original play, <i>Two Days 'til Dawn</i> at the Gene Frankel Theatre as part of the Planet Connections Theatre Festivity. <i>Two Days 'til Dawn</i> deals with a writer who is searching for inspiration, but ultimately finds madness as he encounters the ghosts of historic literary figures. This play fringes on the pressures of expectation, idolization and responsibility.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Laura Sisskin-Fernandez is no stranger to straddling the line of farce and tragedy, having assistant directed the sold-out run of <i>The Cherry Orchard</i> at the Terry Schreiber Studio. Tyler Ham Pong's previous play, <i>Moony Mercury</i>, was a science-fiction about philosophy, politics and religion. While <i>Two Days 'til Dawn</i> avoids time travel and zombies, it continues his trend of hyper aware dialogue, and analysis of the human condition. Although the dream-like elements will appeal to fans of experimental theatre, the play is also intended for a larger audience, given it's themes of family, trust and love.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;white-space:normal !important;""></span>The production will be helping raise awareness of environmental issues through supporting the Lower East Side Ecology Center and will be promoting ways to eliminate energy waste. Performance dates are: </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Wednesday, June 8th @ 9:30pm </p>
<p>Saturday, June 11th @ 3pm </p>
<p>Sunday, June 19th @ 6pm </p>

<h3>Director's Vision</h3>
<p>With Director Laura Sisskin-Fernandez's passion for theater as a means to understand daily life rather than to escape it, she dissects the origins and workings of the given circumstances in <i>Two Days 'til Dawn</i>, dealing with themes of the wasted life, mortality, and the artistic struggle. Various levels of reality are established throughout the play, encouraging an objective experience rather than a personal journey. In a society, and especially in such a city as New York, where achieving success has become the highest of priorities, it is easy to relate to the desire to make an impact on the world, while maintaining a connection to one's personal values. </p>
<h4><br/></h4>
</div><div>
<div style=""""><h3 style="""">What We Need &amp; What You Get<br/>
</h3></div>
<p>It is our goal to carry out a production worth being picked up Off-Broadway. Money raised goes towards set, props, costumes, and promotion.  The higher the quality of the visuals, the more detailed and artistically expressed the production will be. Also, the more we can afford to spread the word (via flyers, t-shirts, etc) and get reviewed by the press, the better our chances are to share the wonderful and complex voices discovered in this play with more audiences. </p>

</div></div>","Our Story
Two Days 'til Dawn will be having it's World Premiere at the Gene Frankel Theatre, NYC. Tragic, Beautiful and Dream-like, this play will take you on a psychological roller-coaster.

Open Lab Collective is going to be running a production of Tyler Ham Pong's original play, Two Days 'til Dawn at the Gene Frankel Theatre as part of the Planet Connections Theatre Festivity. Two Days 'til Dawn deals with a writer who is searching for inspiration, but ultimately finds madness as he encounters the ghosts of historic literary figures. This play fringes on the pressures of expectation, idolization and responsibility.

Laura Sisskin-Fernandez is no stranger to straddling the line of farce and tragedy, having assistant directed the sold-out run of The Cherry Orchard at the Terry Schreiber Studio. Tyler Ham Pong's previous play, Moony Mercury, was a science-fiction about philosophy, politics and religion. While Two Days 'til Dawn avoids time travel and zombies, it continues his trend of hyper aware dialogue, and analysis of the human condition. Although the dream-like elements will appeal to fans of experimental theatre, the play is also intended for a larger audience, given it's themes of family, trust and love.

The production will be helping raise awareness of environmental issues through supporting the Lower East Side Ecology Center and will be promoting ways to eliminate energy waste. Performance dates are: 

Wednesday, June 8th @ 9:30pm 
Saturday, June 11th @ 3pm 
Sunday, June 19th @ 6pm 
Monday, June 20th @ 4:30pm 
Wednesday, June 22nd @ 7pm 
Saturday, June 25th @ 5pm


Director's Vision
With Director Laura Sisskin-Fernandez's passion for theater as a means to understand daily life rather than to escape it, she dissects the origins and workings of the given circumstances in Two Days 'til Dawn, dealing with themes of the wasted life, mortality, and the artistic struggle. Various levels of reality are established throughout the play, encouraging an objective experience rather than a personal journey. In a society, and especially in such a city as New York, where achieving success has become the highest of priorities, it is easy to relate to the desire to make an impact on the world, while maintaining a connection to one's personal values. 


What We Need & What You Get

It is our goal to carry out a production worth being picked up Off-Broadway. Money raised goes towards set, props, costumes, and promotion.  The higher the quality of the visuals, the more detailed and artistically expressed the production will be. Also, the more we can afford to spread the word (via flyers, t-shirts, etc) and get reviewed by the press, the better our chances are to share the wonderful and complex voices discovered in this play with more audiences. 



Other Ways You Can Help
You can also help raise money simply by spreading the word! Please share this page with others -- friends, family, anyone you think would appreciate this type of production. The future of Two Days 'til Dawn will not be the same without you!

Tyler Ham Pong (playwright) has collaborated with playwright Saviana Stanescu in developing the play E-Dating, directed by Gia Forakis, and has written, produced and starred in Moony Mercury at the Manhattan Repertory Theatre. He has also starred in countless festival-bound short films, and is currently producing his own short film, Dreamer In Exile: a screenplay that has received much attention in more than half a dozen screenplay writing festivals, and was workshopped in Oklahoma for the 2010 Bare Bones International FIlm Festival. His most recent screenplay Breakup Brody won the 2011 Award of Excellence at the Canada International Film Festival. 

Laura Sisskin-Fernandez (director) started directing at Emerson College where she was awarded a grant through the Penelope Hirsch Student Director Award for her production of The Last Days of Judas Iscariot. She continued honing her skills alongside renowned director Terry Schreiber as his assistant director on the sold-out run of The Cherry Orchard at The Gloria Maddox Theater. Currently, she is working with the acclaimed Italian director, Orietta Crispino at TheaterLab.

Two Days 'til Dawn stars Anthony Ames, Mary Monahan, Geoffrey Pomeroy and Jillian K. Waters.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am the girl that ran away from the circus to find her own way to dance, to tell stories and express joy through aerial dance. I am an artist and variety performer specialising in hula hoop and low flying aerial dance. Only lately I have nowhere to fly. After 5 years training I find myself dancing alone from the confines of a rickety hammock frame. I need more space, I need a place to float.</p>
<p>My campaign is to escape the hammock frame and get a portable, freestanding rig to devise my own aerial stories and let others come and learn and play on it in a tranquil and intimate setting. This would change me from dancing alone in a stinky bedsit to collaborating with film makers and sharing skills with others but also a greater freedom of movement to express mysef without whacking metal poles. Mostly it will just bring me joy.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<p>The money pledged will be spent on a 13ft portable aerial rig that is small enough to fit in a studio but big enough for aerial hammock and aerial hoop/dance trapeze. I also need an aerial hammock and the accessories to hang it from.</p>
<p>In return for pledges my perks include artwork, free aerial dance sessions, hula hoops and even the chance to have my future studio named after you.</p>
<p>If the target isn't raised any money pledged will be saved until I have managed to save the full amount needed to purchase a rig.</p>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>For years now aerial dance and circus has been the love of my life. I have never proclaimed to be great but even the simplest balances, spinning upside down bring this feeling of peace and elation. My little dances are often like songs to me, full of messages and memories and for the last year I have felt kind of inhibited by lack of space. I would love to bring the childish, giddy, 'at one' sensation of floating in dance to others either through performing on film or letting them try it. I want others to feel no pressure, that they can learn a whole routine or just lie and nap suspended to relax a while. If I can not find a studio to put this in I will put it in fields and parks and rooftops, mountain tops anywhere so there is a place to dance like this.</p>
<p>My track record includes 5 years of circus training (some self taught) and performing. My performance work has included the Paralympic Ceremony 2012, cabarets and outdoor events. I have a degree in Theatre Design and Practise and have taught circus skills to adults and children.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>This project is also looking for suitable spaces to erect the rig and if you can help in that way at all please get in touch.</p>

<p>Whitman Drama teamed with Theater Unlimited DC is a troupe of college bound and college level performers from the greater Washington, DC area. These young people have come together to explore the struggle of adolescence in Duncan Sheik &amp; Steven Sater’s musical Spring Awakening through the eyes of those closest to its content: themselves. The company is composed of over 30 student perfomers, musicians, technicians, designers and 3 mentoring adults (chaperones).Our production has already been accepted to perform in the 2013 Edinburgh Fringe Festival at:</p>
<p>Augustine's - The Sanctuary<br/>located in Augustine United Church<br/>41 George IVth Bridge</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://photos-g.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/165143_188612551149731_1290703_a.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We need your help getting there by supporting our campaign to raise funds for production expenses.</p>
<h3><em>What We Need &amp; What You Get</em></h3>
<p>The cost to transport the students and the show to Scotland and participate in the festival will be approximately $130,000.</p>
<p>Each student is paying for his/her own travel food and lodging expenses, and as a group, the students are committed to a wide variety of fundraising activities in an effort to secure the necessary financial support. </p>
<p>Donations will go to renting the theater space, attainting the legal rights of the show, costumes, set design, shipping of insturments, lighting and sound equipment. </p>
<p>Additionally you can see our ""perks"" listed to the side in consideration for your generous support.</p>
<h3><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.whitmandrama.com/style/nameplate.png"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></h3>
<p><span><span>Whitman Drama is an award-winning high school drama department directed by theater professional Christopher Gerken. </span>Whitman Drama is structured very much like a conservatory program. The department's primary focus is on the process of artistic development rather than the end-product. Students are responsible for ALL aspects of theater production. They participate in multiple theater components — everything from on-stage performance to design to technical and production management. The organization has an annual Student Producer, annual Student Stage Manager, annual Student Technical Director, and assistants to these positions who change per production. It strives to promote intelligence, commitment, diversity and an understanding of the human condition by applying techniques based in realism. Whitman Drama especially emphasizes student involvement and ownership. The program is based in Bethesda, Maryland.

<div>
<p><span>SPRING AWAKENING is a tragedy and the themes and issues that the main characters deal with in SPRING AWAKENING produce tragic consequences still today.

The famous playwright, Bertolt Brecht, once said of theater that, “The point is not to leave the spectator purged by a catharsis but to leave him a changed man (or woman), to sow within him the seeds of changes which must be completed outside the theater”.

</div></div>","ABOUT THE PROJECT
Whitman Drama teamed with Theater Unlimited DC is a troupe of college bound and college level performers from the greater Washington, DC area. These young people have come together to explore the struggle of adolescence in Duncan Sheik & Steven Sater’s musical Spring Awakening through the eyes of those closest to its content: themselves. The company is composed of over 30 student perfomers, musicians, technicians, designers and 3 mentoring adults (chaperones).Our production has already been accepted to perform in the 2013 Edinburgh Fringe Festival at:
Augustine's - The Sanctuarylocated in Augustine United Church41 George IVth Bridge

 
We need your help getting there by supporting our campaign to raise funds for production expenses.
What We Need & What You Get
The cost to transport the students and the show to Scotland and participate in the festival will be approximately $130,000.
Each student is paying for his/her own travel food and lodging expenses, and as a group, the students are committed to a wide variety of fundraising activities in an effort to secure the necessary financial support. 
Donations will go to renting the theater space, attainting the legal rights of the show, costumes, set design, shipping of insturments, lighting and sound equipment. 
Additionally you can see our ""perks"" listed to the side in consideration for your generous support.

Whitman Drama is an award-winning high school drama department directed by theater professional Christopher Gerken. Whitman Drama is structured very much like a conservatory program. The department's primary focus is on the process of artistic development rather than the end-product. Students are responsible for ALL aspects of theater production. They participate in multiple theater components — everything from on-stage performance to design to technical and production management. The organization has an annual Student Producer, annual Student Stage Manager, annual Student Technical Director, and assistants to these positions who change per production. It strives to promote intelligence, commitment, diversity and an understanding of the human condition by applying techniques based in realism. Whitman Drama especially emphasizes student involvement and ownership. The program is based in Bethesda, Maryland. Whitman Drama has successfully performed at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival twice before with productions of Songs For A New World (2008) and The Laramie Project (2011).

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Wild Woman Theatre aims to empower Indigenous women through story and providing artistic opportunities to emerging artists.</p>
<p>Originally developed through Native Earth’s Annimikiig program, SPAWN has since had two workshop readings as part of the Weesageechak Festival in November 2014 and 2016. This spring the play will be presented at a festival in Vancouver, BC at the Vancity Culture Lab. Unfortunately, we did not receive government funding but we are still accountable to the festival. Therefore, we are reaching out to the community for your help.</p>
<p>SPAWN is a new Canadian play that weaves traditional Coast Salish stories with dance and multi-media to tell the story of death and new life. It is the struggle to reconnect to family, culture, community, and land. </p>

<h3>FreakFest is a weekly alternative comedy show.</h3>
<p>It's a place where performers can show off their weirdest, most outrageous material. No stand up, no improv, all insanity. We've had: a guy eat a cardboard box, a mime instruct two people in one big shirt to peel an orange, and presentations on everything from queer theory to cannibalism.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We believe in paying our performers. We also need to pay rent to our theater each week. We are asking for your support so we can continue to afford both of these expenses. Any and all donations we receive will go directly to our rent and our performers, and any extra will go to doing bigger and better shows in the future (advertising, touring acts, props, etc.).  </p>
<p>There are a bunch of prizes you can claim when donating through Indiegogo. We have posters, t-shirts, and some wacky chores we're willing to do for you: like being your butler for a day or walking your pet. We will also be auctioning off more silly stuff at our fundraiser show!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please come out to our fundraiser show to show your support for your fellow freaks! August 31st! 10 PM! Under The Gun Theater in Chicago, IL!</p>
<p>Any donation of $15 or more will grant you admission to this special show, but tickets will also be available at the door! </p>

There are a bunch of prizes you can claim when donating through Indiegogo. We have posters, t-shirts, and some wacky chores we're willing to do for you: like being your butler for a day or walking your pet. We will also be auctioning off more silly stuff at our fundraiser show!

Other Ways You Can Help
Please come out to our fundraiser show to show your support for your fellow freaks! August 31st! 10 PM! Under The Gun Theater in Chicago, IL!
Any donation of $15 or more will grant you admission to this special show, but tickets will also be available at the door!",2.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Who &amp; What Is Struck?</h3>
<p><b>STRUCK</b> is a hybrid play/documentary/rock concert drawn from an eclectic group of source materials: Shakespeare’s <i>The Tempest</i>,  Oliver Sacks’ <i>Musicophilia</i>,
 and co-writer/composer Rebecca Hart’s personal account of a lightning 
strike in her early composing days.  Struck tells the story of nomadic 
cult-rock performer Beth Prosser, whose abilities were spawned by a 
lightning strike that could have killed her at the age of 18. Gifted 
with music but burdened with a worsening neurological condition as a 
result, she roams the country in a non-stop tour called the <b>Transient Luminous Event</b>.
  When a mysterious storm strands her in her hometown on the ten-year 
anniversary of the strike, she must confront her family, her past, and 
herself. Rock music, epilepsy, neuroscience, weather patterns, and a guy
 in a lion suit.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Robert Saietta</b> and <b>Rebecca Hart</b> are highly accomplished downtown stalwarts who are collaborating on STRUCK. Mr. Saietta is the Producing Associate Director of <b>International WOW</b>, performing and creating over 20 plays in NYC and abroad. Writing Credits include: <i>Yudkowski Returns!, Robert Saietta is a Liar, Mrs. Sweetney, Ordinary Days, Crime Scene Cleaners</i> and others. Ms. Hart is an actor/musician who divides her time between fronting a rock band (<a href=""http://www.rebeccahart.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.rebeccahart.net</a>) and acting. Most recently she created the role of ‘Lois_L’ in Anne Washburn’s <i>A Devil at Noon</i> at this year’s O’Neill Conference and at the 2011 Humana Festival (ATL).<br/></p>

<h3>Why Do We Need Your Help?</h3>
<p>We have been given the opportunity to kick off this year's Ice 
Factory Festival, presented annually by Soho Think Tank.  While STT 
graciously provides the space (this year at the glorious 3LD space 
downtown) and resources (lighting equipment, tech time, marketing), we 
still have a lot of overhead to cover, from paying our actors, 
musicians, director, and designers, to covering the cost of rental space
 for rehearsals, printing costs for scripts, and the dozens of other 
little costs that add up to a big chunk of money.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Although we have a few sources of income for this project, we are 
relying heavily on our friends and fans to donate through 
indiegogo.com/Struck! for support.  Your dollars will go a long way in 
helping us meet our budget goals.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So we have some funding trickling in from here &amp; there, friends 
&amp; family kind of stuff, with some generous donations underwriting 
parts of the show's budget... but we also have last minute costs (quite a
 few, actually), and the more we can raise in the next couple weeks, the
 more splendiforous we can make this show!  Since it's based around the 
musical stylings of a new-agey rock guru, we thought it would be fun to 
come up with perks that would allow you to do some 21st Century 
entertaining, like having Rebecca come to your party and do some Tarot 
card readings ($100), or have her band play a private concert ($1000). 
 So not only are you supporting a great cause, you are getting a great 
par-tay as well! </p>

<p><b>THE TURN OF THE SCREW</b></p>
<p><i>Adapted by Jeffrey Hatcher from the story by Henry James</i></p>

THE TURN OF THE SCREW
Adapted by Jeffrey Hatcher from the story by Henry James
Based on the provocative tale of suspense, horror and repressed sexuality, this adaptation gives the famous story yet another turn of its own!
A young governess journeys to a lonely English manor house to care for two recently orphaned children. But she is not their first governess. Her predecessor, Miss Jessel, drowned herself when she became pregnant by the sadistic valet, Peter Quint, who was himself found dead soon after under mysterious circumstances.

<p><b></b></p><p><b>Hi! We’re MEENA’S DREAM TEAM - Anu, Anjna, Rajna, Sam, and Ronee, and more – and we want you to join our campaign to give our play a future life after the January 2014 World Premiere at Forum Theatre.</b></p><p></p><p><b>Our Story Begins with Anu Yadav, actress and playwright.</b></p><p>""I started writing Meena's Dream, a play about a young dreamer who fights the evil ‘Worry Machine’, to help me not blame myself for when times got hard – when I was displaced and in need of housing, without health insurance, when money was tight. In our society, more of us are living without our basic needs. I was 12 when my father died, as my mom successfully juggled caring for my brother and I, going to night school, and working various jobs so we could have enough.  Social security helped us not fall through the cracks. I worried, “What if something happened to my mother?” I got scared. Growing up Hindu in Iowa, at night I dreamed that Lord Krishna sat on my bookshelf watching me sleep. My dreams would lead me to be a playwright and actress. But the worries of my youth no longer held me captive. </p><p></p><p>We live in an abundant society, yet somehow we get the message that living with scarcity is an individual problem due to our personal failings. We are alone. This is the heart of the Worry Machine. People remain homeless while homes remain empty. Patients go without medicine as medicine is thrown away. This is the struggle of young Meena.  I'm hoping this play can help support public dialogue about these contradictions, invite people to remember their own childhood dreams, and keep envisioning the possibilities for a world where everyone has enough.</p><p></p><p>This January Forum Theatre will produce the World Premiere of Meena's Dream. I’m working with three incredible musicians, Anjna Swaminathan, Rajna Swaminathan and Sam McCormally, who have created a live original score for the play."" </p><p></p><p></p>

<p><b>Then Entered the
Band: Anjna, Rajna and Sam</b></p>
<p>""When Anu invited us to work on the music
for Meena's Dream, the three of us were coming from very different musical
backgrounds. As we began working together on composing the score, we formed a
mutual aesthetic and rapport that fluidly combined all of our influences into a
unique sound. Over the past two years, we have continued to learn from one
another, and discovered that the music we've created has the scope to impact
people beyond the context of the play. We call our band The Worry Machine. What
is particularly noteworthy is the cross-cultural nature of this music: the
South Indian classical tradition is being used in a novel way in conjunction
with other textures derived from jazz and indie folk to evoke the complex yet
universal emotions of the play. Just like the play, the music straddles
multiple worlds and identities, and conveys a message of its own.</p><p><b>Enter our Directors: Caleen, Paige, and Patrick</b></p><p>Meena was lucky to have not one, but over three directors contribute to it's development and life. Caleen Sinnette Jennings directed the reading of Meena's Dream at Arena Stage, Paige Hernandez directed the workshop production at University of Maryland, and Patrick Crowley is currently directing the world premiere at Forum Theatre. All made a distinctive and invaluable contribution.</p>
<p><b>Going National: Ronee, our Touring Producer</b></p>
<p>""I started working with Anu
because I was inspired by her passion for people and for change. I was
surprised by how deeply Meena’s Dream affected me. The play courageously looks healthcare and poverty in
the eye, and makes us grapple with what to make of it. With humor, imagination,
and great artistry, this body of art works a little magic - bringing each
audience member to a vulnerable place where they can imagine something better. I’m passionate about bringing <i>Meena’s
Dream</i> to a larger audience.""</p>
<p><b>Our Goal: We want to make
a video, a music album and begin touring the play. Will you help us?</b></p>
<p>Making a theater production is tough. Trying
to also produce a music album and a high-quality video that captures the spirit
of the live performance at the same time is even harder. We want this to live
on past the walls of the theatre, and hopefully inspire more dialogue about the
kind of world we should all keep hoping and fighting for. </p>

Machine.</i> <i>Contribute today.</i></p>
<p><b>WHAT WE NEED:</b></p>
<p><b>Meena's Dream Music Album
= $4,000</b></p>
<p>Sometimes finances and scheduling don't allow
all key artists to be present on tour. Meena's Dream will need a high-quality
recording of the musical score created by Anjna, Rajna, and Sam so that
audiences can experience the full work as envisioned, even if our musicians
can't be present with Anu. If we reach our $4,000 goal we can record a
full album- a soundtrack with extended versions of the pieces from the score,
but also including some pieces that didn't find their way into the show.</p>
<p><b>Meena's Dream Video =
$10,000</b></p>
<p>For theatre presenters and producers far from
Washington, DC to consider booking Meena's Dream, they need a video of the
performance so they can evaluate the work. The $10,000 goal would allow the
Meena's Dream team to go even further and create a high-quality film for
potential audiences who can't get to the play. This video is critical for
the artists to represent and advance their work locally, nationally, and
internationally and generate interest in a future life for Meena's Dream.</p>
<p><b>Meena's Dream Tour
Start-Up Funds = $2,000</b></p>
<p>Getting on the road often means self-producing
at first. The $2,000 will provide seed funds for the first traveling production
of <i>Meena's Dream</i>, which will require funds for travel, housing, and
publicity.</p>

<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<p>This spring marks the 5th year anniversary of NYC (and formerly Boston) based contemporary/modern company Grant Jacoby &amp; Dancers. Over the past five years, we have been beyond fortunate to have the opportunities to present work throughout New England, New York City, and beyond, including, but not limited to: La MaMa Experimental Theater Club, Movement Research, Green Space, The Dance Complex (Boston Globe Critic's Pick 2014 &amp; 2015), Green Street Studios (Boston Globe Critic's Pick 2016), AS220 (Dorry Award 2016), RAW Boston (2014 Performer of the Year), and The International Festival of Arts &amp; Ideas.</p>
<p>This April, in line with our five year mark, Grant Jacoby &amp; Dancers will present a brand new work, entitled ""American Pearl,"" at Triskelion Arts in Brooklyn, NY as a part of their Split Bill Series. This opportunity is a huge step forward in our audience visibility and networking presence here in NYC. However, we need your help to make it all happen!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Is This All For?</h3>
<p>In order to keep us up and running through this project, as well as the remainder of our 2019-2020 season, we are hoping to raise $5,000 to cover our various rehearsal and production costs. We have a lot of exciting things on the books, including, but not limited to, the premiere of “American Pearl"" in April , an encore of the work as a part of The Dance Complex’s Festival of Us, You, We, &amp; Them in June, and an upcoming under-wraps (for now) project, set to premiere in NYC in early 2020.</p>
<p>The entirety of the funds raised, regardless of if we reach our goal, will go towards the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compensating the artists involved with ""American Pearl"" (3 dancers, a composer, and an administrative assistant) for their hard, dedicated dancing work.</li>
<li>Reimbursement for studio rental space; we have been fortunate to receive a subsidized grant from Triskelion Arts, supported by the New York State Council on the Arts and the Mertz Gilmore Foundation, however there is still much more than needs to be covered!</li>
<li>Promotional materials that include: photo and video documentation of the performance, flyers/postcards, etc.</li>
<li>Securing funds for our next project, set to premiere in early 2020</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Your Impact</h3>
<p>Making dance professionally, and independently, is hard work! All of the artists involved have donated countless hours &amp; energy to make this project come to life; it only seems right that they are all compensated for their diligent efforts. However, funding for the arts is extremely difficult to come by, and many choreographers, like myself, have to reach out to supporters like you to make it all happen!</p>
<p>It has been a dream come true to run this dance company for the past five years, and it has all been possible because of generous donors who have helped ensure our success. No matter what, we plan on being around for another five years, and beyond, but anything you can do to help us out in the interim is beyond appreciated!!</p>
<p>For your generosity, we are offering the following in terms of compensated perks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Bronze Patron ($10) - Shout out on social media!</p></li>
<li><p>Silver Patron ($25) - Shout out on social media and a personalized thank you letter!</p></li>
<li><p>Gold Patron ($50) - Shout out on social media, personalized thank you letter, and footage of the April 2019 performance!</p></li>

<p><strong>LEMONS</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">What does it mean to be inside or outside of one’s own body?</p> <p>This is the question that led Rebecca to her new play <i>lemons</i>, largely constructed from pieces of direct transcript of Laura (Rebecca's mom) discussing what feeling grounded in the body means to her. There is no separating Laura's--or Rebecca's--understanding of this topic from Laura's 30+ years living with lupus (she was diagnosed at age 20, the same age Rebecca was when she wrote the play). Between her mother’s words are short vignettes from Rebecca’s own life, exploring how these topics inform their relationship with each other and the bodies they call home. Rebecca may perform alone but the play is a conversation between these two women. <i>lemons</i> reveals an honest, complex story of life with chronic illness--one that never resorts to heroic or tragic cliches, one that leaves room for humor, bitterness, and joy.</p> <p>Where?</p>
<p><i>lemons</i> has been accepted into two upcoming festivals in 2019. The first production will be through NYC Summerfest and performed at the Hudson Guild Theatre on W26th St on August 29, August 31, and September 1. The play will next be produced by United Solo at the historic Theatre Row on 42nd St on October 30 with the possibility of more performances later that fall.</p>

<li>A Gathering of the Tribe has been a home for hungry artists since 1991. Steve Cannon has been a mentor to Phoebe Mar for six years, helping her navigate her career and artistic life. Katelyn Pearce and Phoebe Mar met 7 years ago during a production of THE LIBATION BEARERS at another NY institution, American Theatre of Actors. Since then they have not stopped collaborating in film and tv... and now they want to go back to their roots on the stage. <a href=""http://www.tribes.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.tribes.org/</a>
</li>
<li>There is no substitute for live theater... even when we use it to talk about TV. Live theater creates a relationship between audience and actor that is magical and ephemeral. They are in the moment together, effecting one and other. The audience is essential to this moment, which can be created in no other medium. </li>
<li>From the seeds of a simple idea, ""let's put on a play,"" Phoebe and Katelyn have already brought an artistic community together that will keep growing and creating work for artists... especially because everyone who is a part of the this project is being compensated for their time and talent, which so often doesn't happen. </li>
<li>C.S. Hanson is a powerful female voice in the theater world. She has already given us opportunity and we want to shine more light on her unique voice. </li>

Our experience in performing and producing has prepared us to tackle this challenge. You want proof? Check out both seasons of our multi-award winning web series So SOHA on YouTube: http://www.sosohatheseries.com/

Here is the show info: http://www.triskelionarts.org/split-bill-january-3
 

You & Us

- We need your help to offset the costs of creating this piece. Funds we generate from this campaign will go to paying the 6 dancers and 3 musicians first and foremost, who have collectively put in around 70 hours of rehearsal time during this process, with more to come! 
-Our goal is to raise $2000. $1300 will be paid to the dancers, $200 will be paid to the musicians, and $500 will go towards the cost of renting rehearsal space, costumes, and props.
-Anything and everything helps. Please consider donating in the name of art, or the holidays, or whatever may motivate you. There are a few perks you can receive in return as well!
 The Impact
 By donating to the premier of Gateway Dance at Triskelion Arts, you are supporting the arts in a direct way. Gateway Dance will be a 30 minute piece that showcases the talent and voices of young artists trying to do what they love in NYC. We hope to offer you a visual feast of dance, music and costumes that make you feel, think and smile.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>My Story</b></p>
<p>I have been dancing
since I was 6 years old.  I currently dance 5-6 hours each day
training in classical ballet, modern, jazz and contemporary. </p>
<p> My mom is divorced and the sole provider for
our family.  She is working to support me and my sister while she is
attending college to complete her degree and working on a non-profit to help
women leaving domestic abuse.  She has always kept me dancing no matter
what!  </p>
<p>I have
auditioned for Ailey since I was 10 years old.  I was accepted each time
but unable to attend financially.  Last year, thanks to a 50% tuition
scholarship and a successful fundraiser, I was able to attend Alvin Ailey’s
Summer Intensive-Professional Division.  I worked hard while I was there
and I loved every moment.  The instructors were amazing.  It was a
very successful learning experience which helped me earn a full tuition scholarship
at this year’s summer intensive audition. 
 </p>
<p>At my age and level it is critical for me to be able
to attend this intensive in New York to receive the training specific to Ailey
that isn't available in my area so I will be prepared to audition for
acceptance to the Certificate Program of the Ailey School next year.  My short-term goal is to get to
New York this year to attend Ailey’s summer intensive to have training and
performance opportunities with them and for them to be able to assess my ability, work ethic
and focus.  Then I will return home to
complete my senior year of high school since I won’t meet the age requirement to
stay in the housing.  When I am 18, I will audition for the Professional
program and hopefully begin a long, successful career with Ailey. </p>
<p> Any generosity that helps me overcome our
family's financial struggles so I may achieve my fundraising goal to continue
pursuing my dream of dancing with Ailey will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p><b>My Fundraising Goal = $5,000</b></p>
<p>The
tuition for the 6-week Alvin Ailey program is $2,755.  Fortunately, I
received a tuition scholarship to cover all of that except for fees of
$430.  However, I still need to raise a substantial amount of money to be
able to attend the Summer Intensive.  Almost $3000 is required for the
Ailey housing at Fordham University.  Ailey estimates additional costs of
meals and other living expenses of $1800+ and I will need travel expenses to
and from NYC.  I am planning local fundraisers to try to offset the
additional costs for dance clothing, etc. </p>
<p><b>The Difference Your
Contribution Will Make in My Life</b></p>
<p>When I went to Alvin Ailey last year, I felt
like I belonged there.  I knew I had found my path.  I grew so much
as a dancer during my six weeks at Ailey last summer and I know I will gain
even more this summer. During the 2014 Ailey Summer Intensive an audition
was held for scholarship and admission to the year-round school.  I was
accepted with a full scholarship except fees but unable to stay in the housing
since I had just turned 16. I believe I will have a successful experience at
this year's summer intensive also and you will not waste your money by helping
me get there. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>My Dream</b></p>
<p>I hope to be a company
member with Alvin Ailey in the future. I plan to gain everything possible from this
year’s summer intensive at Ailey, and then audition for the year-round school
once I turn 18 and achieve my high school diploma.  From the school, I
will be trying to get accepted into Ailey II and hopefully one day the
company.  I realize there are no guarantees on any of this but this is dream and has become my
life’s goal.  Your contribution would mean the world to me.  It may
mean the difference between whether I am able to continue to pursue my dream of
becoming an Ailey dancer.   You will be helping a dedicated dancer
who doesn’t have the necessary financial support to participate in the training
she needs to become a professional dancer.  </p>
<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<p>It
will be challenging to raise this amount of money in 60 days but I am hopeful
there will be enough people in the world who would like to enjoy an Ailey
performance one day and have the additional joy of knowing they helped one of
the dancers make it to that stage.  </p>
<ul>
<li>My life has had challenges
     financially but I never quit.  I
     always give my art everything I have in me.  </li>
<li>Indiegogo wants to know what
     I will do with the money if I don’t achieve my goal.  I don’t believe that will happen, but if
     I don’t raise all the money needed, I believe I will still make it to
     Ailey.  Even if I have to go for a
     shorter time, I need to be there. The money will be used for Ailey
     training no matter what.  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your
contribution!  I know sometimes you want to help but you can’t contribute
financially.  That doesn’t mean you can’t help though!</p>
<p>Please
share this on your Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. and ask your friends to
help spread the link to their friends.  Please help me get the word out
about what I am trying to achieve.  I don't have much time to make this
happen!  Thank you so much!</p>
