<p style=""text-align: left;"">Nature’s way of creating heat or burning calories is to shiver.  As you get colder you shiver more intensely but at the same rate (7-8Hz).  This is because the energy consumption is not related to the force or tension generated but rather the shortening and lengthening of the muscle fibers.  What happens is that more muscle fibers contract and relax at this magic rate for maximal calorie burn per muscle fiber. <br/> <br/>Impulses through the BionicGym Wraps stimulate the motor-neurons [nerves-to muscles] in the legs and glutei [bum] telling them to contract repeatedly.  (They relax or lengthen by themselves).  If enough muscle is actively contracting at optimal rates they will shout out for blood to supply the oxygen and energy.  Your cardiovascular system [heart and blood vessels] works harder to deliver this blood, i.e. it trains.  You’ll become more breathless and in time heat up – even sweat… after all it is nature’s way to warm up. Crazy right?</p>

So in an effort to help moms and dads enjoy every minute with their kids (even the crappy ones), we spent years crafting the perfect play based solution that would actually make kids want to embrace the potty. We went one step further and added in a Parent’s Guide and a Children’s Book to save parents money, time and mistakes by doing things the right way the first time. Then we went even one step further and crafted reward activities that would enhance and advance your child’s development. And now, we’re happy to share years of potty training expertise and creativity with you. We want nothing more than for you to enjoy Tot on the Pot with your kids while teaching them valuable lessons along the way.We realized we had a real opportunity to positively impact parenting...and so we did.",21.0,1,"1 Campaign

FastPong sensors require sophisticated mounting and we have to make sure as the production number increases the quality of the mounting does not drop. We have communicated this with our manufacturers to make sure they are aware of the difficulties ahead of time and prepare for high volume production. Since FastPong is a relatively large device, we may face challenges with shipping and packaging. We have been in touch with experts in the field to make sure we reduce the risk as much as possible, but due to various rules and regulations in each country, this may become more challenging for some countries and the shipping date may be delayed.

 You can easily pack Fastpong by folding it. Fold it, bring it anywhere, and simply unfold on any table. Every human has an error but Fastpong’s sensors can find where exactly your weakness is. By detecting where the ball is coming at you and where in ping pong table you cannot send the ball to as well as your ball speed, the application allows you to:
Compare your results with your friends to see who’s better.
Find out your weaknesses
Design your own training program on the app or device to improve your weaknesses
Fastpong software is AI-powered and through machine learning, it analyzes your strengths and weaknesses and will create a customized training program for you.Our data analysis system follows up your performance accuracy data and your ball speed data while you are training. With a special algorithm, it analyzes your game and it provides you the best training program as well as tells you how much time you need to train to achieve your goals, according to your improvement.  The app not only analyzes your performance but also lets you record it. Checking your own posture allows you to reflect from a whole new perspective.  Now that you’ve collected the data and recordings on your performance, you can share them with your coaches. No matter how far away they are, your coaches will be able to receive the data and provide you with feedback.  Based on the data and the video of yourself collected on the app, you can start designing your own training program. Simply choose one exercise to target your biggest weakness or mix different exercises to simulate actual table tennis games.FastPong graphs enable users to see all the details about their weakness and strength and also compare their improvement with each other as well as see their progress. It can be tool for coaches to show their students about their progress.   Play alone to master your weaknesses, then show off your skills and beat your family, coworkers, and friends.  FastPong enables you to create your specific game strategies based on your opponent’s weakness or your tactics. By training to limit the available time to change the direction of sending ball into a different specific area in response to different visual stimuli, Fastpong can improve your reaction time and accuracy.A scientific research proved that using Fastpong was more efficient than using a ball throwing machine. Within six weeks, intermediate level players who trained with Fastpong had better improvement rates than players who trained with a ball throwing machine.In this research, 18 players trained for 20 minutes, 3 times a week.After using Fastpong for 6 weeks, their accuracy rate doubled and their choice reaction time improved by 16 percent.Source: https://bit.ly/37rNLEa    Our story starts when I was a national table tennis player and I was always wondering how can I improve my skills. Not until I was a sports science researcher, I came out with a theory with my professor about the reason why reaction time and decision making of athletes improve. In order to test that theory, we needed to create a device to test our theory that we found out it can actually help athletes to improve in a very short time. And now that device transformed to FastPong.A working prototype has been developed, tested and is going through rigorous testing in various scenarios and environments.In order to start manufacturing and bring the product to you, Fastpong needs the support of the crowdfunding community. It will help us and our investors to, first of all, be sure that table tennis player willing to purchase Fastpong as well as cover the cost making molds for the manufacturing and turning the prototype into a manufacturable product. The funds gathered here will go into turning the prototype into a real product. ""I PLAY EACH POINT LIKE MY LIFE DEPENDS ON IT""By purchasing FastPong T-shirt for 30$ you will receive a 20% off coupon (~120$) for the next FastPong device crowdfunding campaign. Fastpong is a revolutionary sport device that everyone or anyone can enjoy. We are not just building a product, we are building a vision that fits anyone in the sport industry.We have made our MVP so far and now we are finalizing the manufacturing settings and also the design of the mold. In this campaign, FastPong would be familiar with crowdfunding and its logistic difficulties to be ready for the main campaign to offer fastpong device in March. We need your support now.    Manufacturing FastPong in very large quantities may become more challenging, however, we have been continuously working with manufacturers and other parties involved to make sure we can increase the production number rapidly, after our campaign. FastPong sensors require sophisticated mounting and we have to make sure as the production number increases the quality of the mounting does not drop. We have communicated this with our manufacturers to make sure they are aware of the difficulties ahead of time and prepare for high volume production. Since FastPong is a relatively large device, we may face challenges with shipping and packaging. We have been in touch with experts in the field to make sure we reduce the risk as much as possible, but due to various rules and regulations in each country, this may become more challenging for some countries and the shipping date may be delayed.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p></p>
<div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><font>We are champions of women's rights making a push for safety when lone women interact with police officers. Sexual assault by officers at traffic stops is an estimated at least 60 incidents per year (I).  Police misconduct has unfortunately increased 25% since 9/11 (II).</font></span></div>
<div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><font><br/></font></span></div>
<div>
<font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000""><div>My fiancee and I personally got involved with this issue after I pulled over at what looked like an open store while driving alone past midnight on the Pacific Coast Highway. The sheriff said my headlight was out, and walked away silently leaving a $500 additional citation on my ticket citing I had ""failed to yield"" because I sought to pull over in a lit, populated area. I chose to pull over near a store for safety, having read numerous articles of officers sexually assaulting women at traffic stops. My rights were violated when I was fined $500 for doing something reasonable to protect myself. I was suspicious upon seeing the patrol car drive alongside me to peer inside my vehicle, when I was going the speed limit. This suspicion was combined with my previous encounter with a New Jersey police department whose chief was fired for promoting prostitution. As long as there are incidents of police misconduct with lone females, it is our right to take reasonable means to protect ourselves. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>My fiancee and I spoke numerous times to the Malibu City Council about this incident. We learned how in September 2009 Mitrice Richardson, after witnesses at a restaurant said she exhibited signs of mental health instability, was detained then released from the Malibu/Lost Hills sheriff station at 1:25AM, alone, without money or a cell phone. After release Mitrice fell victim to an unknown attacker and her remains were found less than three miles from the station. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Incidents like these clearly demonstrate the need for greater understanding and regard for women's safety by law enforcement. Law enforcement should take into account that women are targeted for rape and often their best defense is to not be alone in desolate areas. It is unacceptable that lone female drivers under non-emergency situations are cited $500 tickets for stopping in populated areas instead of desolate stretches of highway at night.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>What my fiancee and I accomplished so far, by speaking up, was to have the Malibu/Lost Hills sheriff protocols reviewed at a Malibu Public Safety Commission meeting. Some of Mitrice's family and/or friends attended the meeting and spoke about their concerns as well. The sheriff department's position was that, the city Public Safety Commission did not have power to change their protocols, and could only make recommendations. Upon hearing how women's purses were sometimes locked away with impounded vehicles, and women detained would be released without cell phones or money at night, the Commission voted 3 to 1 in favor of recommending sheriff protocol improvements to ensure essentials like money and cell phones are provided to released detainees, even if those items are kept in purses.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>This was a small but significant step by the city, with no guarantee the recommendation will be followed. We are asking donors to help compensate our time and further our ability to fight for safety rights. Our actions for public safety were done at our own expense, to the point we are broke and cannot continue putting in time without support.</div>

</h3></div></div>","Our Story

We are champions of women's rights making a push for safety when lone women interact with police officers. Sexual assault by officers at traffic stops is an estimated at least 60 incidents per year (I).  Police misconduct has unfortunately increased 25% since 9/11 (II).


My fiancee and I personally got involved with this issue after I pulled over at what looked like an open store while driving alone past midnight on the Pacific Coast Highway. The sheriff said my headlight was out, and walked away silently leaving a $500 additional citation on my ticket citing I had ""failed to yield"" because I sought to pull over in a lit, populated area. I chose to pull over near a store for safety, having read numerous articles of officers sexually assaulting women at traffic stops. My rights were violated when I was fined $500 for doing something reasonable to protect myself. I was suspicious upon seeing the patrol car drive alongside me to peer inside my vehicle, when I was going the speed limit. This suspicion was combined with my previous encounter with a New Jersey police department whose chief was fired for promoting prostitution. As long as there are incidents of police misconduct with lone females, it is our right to take reasonable means to protect ourselves. 

My fiancee and I spoke numerous times to the Malibu City Council about this incident. We learned how in September 2009 Mitrice Richardson, after witnesses at a restaurant said she exhibited signs of mental health instability, was detained then released from the Malibu/Lost Hills sheriff station at 1:25AM, alone, without money or a cell phone. After release Mitrice fell victim to an unknown attacker and her remains were found less than three miles from the station. 

Incidents like these clearly demonstrate the need for greater understanding and regard for women's safety by law enforcement. Law enforcement should take into account that women are targeted for rape and often their best defense is to not be alone in desolate areas. It is unacceptable that lone female drivers under non-emergency situations are cited $500 tickets for stopping in populated areas instead of desolate stretches of highway at night.

What my fiancee and I accomplished so far, by speaking up, was to have the Malibu/Lost Hills sheriff protocols reviewed at a Malibu Public Safety Commission meeting. Some of Mitrice's family and/or friends attended the meeting and spoke about their concerns as well. The sheriff department's position was that, the city Public Safety Commission did not have power to change their protocols, and could only make recommendations. Upon hearing how women's purses were sometimes locked away with impounded vehicles, and women detained would be released without cell phones or money at night, the Commission voted 3 to 1 in favor of recommending sheriff protocol improvements to ensure essentials like money and cell phones are provided to released detainees, even if those items are kept in purses.

This was a small but significant step by the city, with no guarantee the recommendation will be followed. We are asking donors to help compensate our time and further our ability to fight for safety rights. Our actions for public safety were done at our own expense, to the point we are broke and cannot continue putting in time without support.

The Impact



This is a local (Lost Hills / Malibu Sheriff Dpt.), State, AND National Issue.

Please watch the videos on these 2 links:
http://youtube.com/watch?v=ibSwITK4jjQ


http:// 
These videos show women being restrained for pulling their cars over in populated areas to keep themselves safe during traffic stops.  One of the women had on her hazards.
Each woman are each from separate states.  It's really important women all over the nation may safely pull over in a populated, open public, lit area without fearing heavy financial penalty (as I was in Malibu, CA), being pulled out of the car, being restrained on the ground, and/or being handcuffed as in seen in the above cases.   

According to The National Police Misconduct Statistics and Reporting Project's Quarterly Q1 Report (Look here http:// ), police are accused 3 times more than the rest of the population for sexual assaults on women.
There are enough stories on a weekly basis of real and fake law enforcers raping women.  Many of these are at traffic stops.  Without a national protection in place, situations like these will continue to happen making women vulnerable to sexual assault, bodily and emotional trauma, and/or financially penalties. 

What We Need & What You Get


We need approximately $500 to appeal our case, pleading innocent for attempting to pull my car in an area where a store was open.  The rest of what we are asking for is to continue to speak at meetings, call legislators, contact civil and women's rights organizations, and keep the press involved to change policy as it stands.

<p>Several years ago, while preparing for medical school, Jo was t-boned by a semi-truck during a cross-country bike trip. The accident left her in chronic pain followed by weight gain, depression, and worst of all, the hopeless realization that she would be disabled for the rest of her life. </p>
<p>Not wanting to accept over 20 doctors’ advice, which was Prozac for her depression and Percocet for her pain, she went on journey to heal herself the only way she knew how – through eating a whole foods diet. </p>

</div></div>","Help us create the Conscious Cleanse On Demand.  Cleanse anytime with the support of a health coach. 

The Conscious Cleanse is a 14-day program that will will help you kick start weight loss and better health. We've helped thousands of people achieve amazing results and now we need your help to create a subscription model with an automated, video-based membership program that people can access anytime and anywhere.



The Conscious Cleanse is not a diet, nor is it a traditional ""cleanse."" There are no calorie restrictions, you will not starve yourself, or be required to buy expensive supplements.On the Conscious Cleanse you'll eat REAL FOOD! (Check out the mouth-watering cleanse-friendly food below.) You'll eliminate processed foods, caffeine, alcohol, sugar, 
and other foods that are slowing you down. The results are nothing short of astonishing. 
The effects of the cleanse often go much beyond weight loss: 

 Boundless energy

Relief from aches and pains 

Eliminate cravings and addictions 

Better sleep
Renewed confidence
Improved digestion and elimination
Eliminate gas and bloating
Identify food allergies

Reduce fine lines
Glowing skin

And much more.....











We've sold over 30,000 copies of our book The Conscious Cleanse: Lose Weight, Heal Your Body, and Transform Your Life in 14 Days,"" and we're only getting started. 

The Problem 
There are two challenges with our current model:
1. Currently we run our live supported cleanse online 5 
times per year with specified start dates. If one of our start dates doesn’t work for 
you, you’re left to do it alone without the support of the community or access to a health coach. 
2. People feel great after the program, and for years they have asked us, ""what's next?"" With the Conscious Cleanse On Demand we'll be able to offer tools and support so people can live the Conscious Cleanse lifestyle (what we call the 80:20) all year long. 





Our passion is people. Every story matters and
 every person counts. When you sign up for one of our online programs 
you will get personalized attention and customer support that is unparalleled in our industry. 
The Conscious Cleanse On Demand will be an online platform where 
people can access the Conscious Cleanse at anytime–and get the support 
to match it year round.  


The $25,000 that we're raising will help cover a small portion of the overall cost needed to create an automated, video-based membership program.  

With your help, we'll be able to: 

Start filming 14 days of inspirational videos plus bonus content
Start building the membership site 

Continue to grow our team of health coaches so we can provide year-round support


Together we're creating a ripple effect because when more of us are healthy, more of us will reach our true potential. 
What's in it for You











Our Story


Do you ever feel like you’ve been hit by a truck? 
Well, Jo Schaalman has, and she is an expert in recovery and healing the body. 
                
Several years ago, while preparing for medical school, Jo was t-boned by a semi-truck during a cross-country bike trip. The accident left her in chronic pain followed by weight gain, depression, and worst of all, the hopeless realization that she would be disabled for the rest of her life. 
Not wanting to accept over 20 doctors’ advice, which was Prozac for her depression and Percocet for her pain, she went on journey to heal herself the only way she knew how – through eating a whole foods diet. 

Jo and Jules are the co-founders of the Conscious Cleanse and the co-authors of the book The Conscious Cleanse: Lose Weight, Heal Your Body and Transform Your Life in 14 Days. 
They came together based on a mutual passion for healing the body by looking at food as medicine. They are an ""odd couple"" of health innovators with entirely different nutrition profiles. However, their firsthand experience proves that there is no one-size-fits-all-approach to cleansing or health. Together they’ve led thousands of people through their online supported 
cleanse through their accessible and lighthearted approach. They’ve been
 dubbed “the real deal” by founder and chief creative director Bobbi 
Brown, of Bobbi Brown Cosmetics, beauty editor of the TODAY show. Vibrant health is something that everyone can access. We can make a difference with your help!

Aside from contributing financially, there are other ways to join the Conscious Cleanse Revolution. Please help us spread the word by sharing this campaign 
with your own friends and family through your social media networks. Like us on Facebook and follow us on Instagram and Twitter, and please 
reach out to us any time with thoughts, suggestions or anything else. We would love to hear from you! 
Thank you for your support!

<p>Throughout the reservations many of the communities have local
Wellness Centers or Fitness Facilities that provide fitness classes and exercise equipment
for patient and public use. Many of these communities are located hundreds of miles
from the nearest major city and because of the remote locations many of these
centers have equipment that are in poor condition or not working due to lack of
proper maintenance. With a repair time of one to two weeks before the nearest
service provider is available, this is a discouragement to those who come to
these facilities.  As an Indoor cycling
instructor I need the bikes to be operating and well maintained, any bike that
is not operating is one person that will not be able to attend the class. The
same goes for a treadmill, elliptical or any fitness machine. Because of this I attended a service tech training in 2014 to become a certified service
technician with one of the major fitness equipment manufacturers that distributes four well-known brands in the fitness market today. My re-certification comes
due in September 2016 and once completed I will be starting my own business and
would like to provide the repair services that are needed across the
reservation and surrounding communities. </p>
<p>The Fitness Industry today has a wide variety of
manufacturers carrying similar product lines, so each facility carries a
different variety of those manufacturers equipment. Which brings me to the
purpose of this campaign. I am looking to expand and attend another major
manufacturer’s factory service provider certification training to be held in
St. Louis, Missouri in November 2016. Having the support of two major companies
will greatly enhance the success of my venture, but the real success for this
venture comes from backers, supporters and believers like you who are the
foundation of any business today! People who have that same desire and dream of
starting a business and taking the steps to make it happen. The past couple
years my dream of this business has always been that, a dream, but now I am
putting it in motion and with your help we can make this dream a “REALITY”. </p>

Great for those who sit for prolonged periods of time, weight lift (carrying around children counts), or use their shoulder for any rotating movement (throwing, swimming, etc). Doctor's Note: Rolling your upper back or postural muscles can help alleviate neck or upper back pain associated with sitting for long periods of time (at a desk, in a car, etc). Great way to release tension and improve posture.Doctor's Note: Rolling the quadricep can alleviate pain at the knee and hip.

<p><strong>Mission</strong></p>
<p>The time when <strong>men</strong> were required to be indifferent to health and wellness has come to an end.  Focus on <strong>physical exercise </strong>in gyms or on teams, attention to <strong>nutrition</strong> and concern for fashion and <strong>style</strong> are truly the norm.  However, one element of good health has been overlooked and underserved – <strong>skincare</strong>.  Healthy skin is just as important as any other category of wellness, yet few have attempted to create products that truly meet the needs of a man - lightweight, simple and easy to use moisturizers that protect the skin without leaving any residue or shine. <strong>For every man whose aim is self-improvement, whose aim is to be better than the day before – Ruffhaus crew is here to serve you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>About Ruffhaus Crew</strong> </p>

High moisturization, low residue with a cool refreshing feel are the defining characteristics of every product.  Located in Montreal, Quebec, the products have been developed with the harshness of the Canadian winter in mind. <strong>Expect high performance from the Ruffhaus Crew Moisturizers with BCAAs.</strong></p>

Mission
The time when men were required to be indifferent to health and wellness has come to an end.  Focus on physical exercise in gyms or on teams, attention to nutrition and concern for fashion and style are truly the norm.  However, one element of good health has been overlooked and underserved – skincare.  Healthy skin is just as important as any other category of wellness, yet few have attempted to create products that truly meet the needs of a man - lightweight, simple and easy to use moisturizers that protect the skin without leaving any residue or shine. For every man whose aim is self-improvement, whose aim is to be better than the day before – Ruffhaus crew is here to serve you.
About Ruffhaus Crew 
Ruffhaus Crew is a boutique men's skincare brand that is completely new to the market - and you can expect products unlike anything else available. High moisturization, low residue with a cool refreshing feel are the defining characteristics of every product.  Located in Montreal, Quebec, the products have been developed with the harshness of the Canadian winter in mind. Expect high performance from the Ruffhaus Crew Moisturizers with BCAAs.
Products
Moisturizers formulated to fit healthy, active, lifestyles.  Use morning or night time. Before or after a workout.  Or any other time your skin needs a fix. Get the job done. Nothing more and nothing less.
Face Moisturizer 25 ingredients that are perfectly combined to moisturize, repair and protect.  Take care of your skin - it's going to be with you for awhile. Hand Moisturizer A specially formulated treatment for your hands.  You put your hands through a lot! They deserve the same care as everything else.     Lip Balm Beat the dry weather and keep lips smooth and hydrated.Formulation Highlights:BCAAs Branched Chain Amino Acids.  This is the good stuff and the cornerstone of Ruffhaus products. They are good for your muscles but great for your skin too.  Just a fractional amount repairs the damage that we do on a daily basis.Essential Oils - Eucalyptus, Jojoba, Rosemary, LemonThese oils do double duty - they nourish the skin and form a protective layer that prevents moisture from leaving your skin.  Essential oils pack a punch but they're lightweight and did we mention they smell great! (You'll thank us for these!)Caffeine You've heard of it before - it reduces inflammation and redness through vasoconstriction.  It works in concert with the other ingredients to keep your skin looking great.Provitamin B5 It's like glycerin but better!  Higher impact ingredient that doesn't irritate the skin and isn't sticky.  All the good stuff without the mess.Vitamin E It's the anti-oxidant we know and love.  Not all forms of it are active though. Ruffhaus uses tocopherol - the best kind.Benefits:

V-Meds, with its nano-mist technology, can deliver its all-natural and homeopathic formulated solution deep into the lungs as nano-mist, where it reaches the small air sacs - allowing the natural healing and cleansing process to begin.</div>
<div style=""text-align:center;font-size:20px;padding:20px 0;font-weight:bold;"">Natural Lung Cleanse Works Better then Cortisone Inhalers, and Greatly Reduces for Many! Over 3000 units now in use!</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Nano-mist is a concentration of droplets that are measured in nano-meters. Droplet size can very from 50 nano-meters to 400 nano-meters. To give you a perspective of how small that is: an atom is 1/10 to 5/10 of a nano-meter. That is how it penetrates  so deep into the lungs. It is the size of the droplets that can carry even smaller particles of ingredients all the way to the deep alveoli region of the lungs and providing soothing relief.</span></div>

Say Goodbye to Unhealthy Lungs
V-Meds' Lung Cleansing Therapy is the only all-natural and homeopathic lung treatment that uses no cortisone and no steroids. The best thing about this is, there aren't any side effects.Works better than inhalers, many customers claim.Breathing is a big thing. It affects mobility, sleep, mood, and longevity. There's nothing worse than feeling your chest tighten making it hard to breathe. This could happen to anyone suffering from asthma, COPD, bronchitis, and other lung problems. With V-Meds' all-natural and homeopathic formula, you can:


Alleviate congestion and clear your airways


Suppress coughing, and

Stop wheezing fast







 

How It Works
V-Meds, with its nano-mist technology, can deliver its all-natural and homeopathic formulated solution deep into the lungs as nano-mist, where it reaches the small air sacs - allowing the natural healing and cleansing process to begin.
Natural Lung Cleanse Works Better then Cortisone Inhalers, and Greatly Reduces for Many! Over 3000 units now in use!
Nano-mist is a concentration of droplets that are measured in nano-meters. Droplet size can very from 50 nano-meters to 400 nano-meters. To give you a perspective of how small that is: an atom is 1/10 to 5/10 of a nano-meter. That is how it penetrates  so deep into the lungs. It is the size of the droplets that can carry even smaller particles of ingredients all the way to the deep alveoli region of the lungs and providing soothing relief.




 

What Is It Made Of?


 


What We Need and What Perks You Get
Most of our funding will go toward purchasing and building a new larger Clean Room. The balance will be used for research and development. We have plans to formulate new solutions for other medical conditions. 
What People Are Saying
Thousands of our Lung Cleansing Kit are in use right now. Many customers have claimed we saved or radically improved their lives. Some even cry on the phone with gratitude. Many of our customer have replaced cortisone inhalers and are now repeat customers. And the fact that we are selling hundreds more of our refills demonstrates that our product works for LIFE.

My granddaughter got rid of a bad cold in 24 hours. Expelled tons of mucus.

<p>Hi, I'm Jackie Prell. My project combines two passions: good, organic, nutrient-dense food and how to grow it.</p>
<p>I started a certified organic sugarcane juice business a few years ago. My husband and I grow the sugarcane, limes, lemons, tumeric and most of the other ingredients that go into the juice on our two farms in Hawaii. People love the juice, it's delicious and good for you. It's a golden ambrosia, an ancient food that your body recognizes and assimilates easily, the opposite of the processed white sugar we're all familiar with. It's got electrolytes, anti-oxidants, B vitamins and more. It's low in simple sugars and rich in complex carbohydrates, sustaining your energy level all day long.</p>
<p>Our juice business has grown organically, with no debt, and being farmers first, we'd like to keep it that way, which is where you come in.</p>
<p>Last summer, in the midst of building a new certified kitchen for our juice operation, I applied for a USDA Producer Value-Added grant (matching funds...), which I was recently awarded. This is great news, except the matching funds have been spent on renovations and other start-up costs.  For every dollar I spend, I'll be reimbursed by the USDA for half that amount. This means, every dollar you contribute will actually be worth a dollar and a half. </p>
<p>The $24,000 will go towards bottles and the $12,000 we're reimbursed towards a new freezer and 2 cane cleaners, rounding out our business wish list and assuring us of a supply of bottles at the very lowest cost. If we're partially funded, our project will be scaled down to match the funds raised.</p>
<p>Your reward? Juice, and lots of it! And a <em>Cane Rush</em> cartoon book. We're also offering as rewards, organic dried apple bananas, spicy kale chips, tumeric-infused hot sauce, farm tours and lessons in Natural Farming, and private dinners at Sweet Cane Cafe. <em>Cane Rush</em> t-shirts too! Boost us with a large enough donation and we'll name a juice after you!</p>
<p>And the how-to-grow nutrient-dense food part? I'm including instructions on making your own organic soil inoculant, which revitalizes soil by encouraging the growth of mycorrhizae. Mycorrhizae form a symbiotic relationship between plants and the soil, benefiting both. They provide nutrients and water from the soil to the plant and they take waste products from plants, sequestering carbon in soil humus. Check out my website, <a href=""http://www.kalapanaorganics.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.kalapanaorganics.com</a>  and help spread the word about Korean Natural Farming. Korean Natural Farming is awesome: cheap, effective and do-it-yourself. Even if you can't donate, please pass on this information to all those urban farmers, school gardeners, roof-top gardeners, non-profits, ag professors, organic and conventional farmers, and other green thumbers that you may know. It's knowledge that can help change the world.</p>
<p>The ripple effect of our success: we'll support other local organic farmers by buying their produce and products. We'll continue mentoring, provide jobs, and launch new products, such as kale chips, tumeric-infused hot sauce, and taro burgers.</p>
<p>My husband and I have been farming in Hawaii a combined 50+ years, a noble but necessarily profitable endeavor. Thank you for helping us to succeed in our farm-to-entrepreneur venture. You're making Hawaii and the world a sweeter place.</p>

<p>Lisa is a wonderful person.  She has lost the little self confidence she had due to her loss of hair, scars, and now her teeth breaking off.   Lisa has stage 3 breast cancer.  It was diagnosed late and it was aggresively treated.  She did 6 months of weekly chemo and 35 straight days of radiation.  These along with her medications has caused her teeth to decay and break and has her in great pain.  No dental insurance.  No family to help.  Her friends love her dearly but have no funds to help.  The estimate to surgically remove her teeth and make dentures is just under $9000.  </p>
<p>Lisa is disabled with PTSD due to a childhood of obscene torture.  She loves people in spite of the abuse and wants to help others.  She always kept a great attitude during cancer treatment and made an effort to cheer other patients and listened to their problems and fears.  Even though she is in pain daily with hand and foot syndrome along with the dental pain she still cares so much about the pain of others.  She wants to continue helping others.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Cheryl Neuman, and I was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer in May of 2011. I am the one in the picture holding the dog.  A Petscan in October of that year, showed no cancer, but another scan in January 2012 showed the cancer reoccurring in the form of 4 tumors, one rather large at over 3 cm. I am in my second round of chemotheray treatments, and the doctors indicate to be as aggresive as we can be in treatment, radiation therapy should be added to the chemo.  Our insurance company is refusing to pay for a Petscan needed to adequately guage the radiation field for treatment, as well as to adequately guage the cancer growth to formulate other treatment options, as well.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We need to raise $4,000, to pay for a Petscan Blue Cross/Blue Shield is refusing to cover. By letter they said in effect, ""a Petscan for this type of recurring cancer is not an effective, or approved theray"".  They are in effect saying that their view of  the prognosis is not good enough for them to cover the scan cost.  In an Appeal subsequent to their denial, part of the process was a conversation our Radiologist had with a Blue Cross/Blue Shield doctor, who said, ""if it were my patient, I would be wanting to do exactly the same thing, but unfortunately we won't cover the cost"".</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The scan could lead the way to adding radiation treatment to help in this fight against a particularly aggresive and lethal cancer form, as well as to determine other treatment, once the extent of the tumor growth is adequately measured.....a Catscan last week is showing the large tumor to be growning, and radiation would definitely go a long way in fighting that growth.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Any help is appreciated with hearfelt gratitude.  Should monetary assistance not be possible, I understand, as we are having a tough time too with medical  bills and everything else.....if dollars are not possible, I repectfully ask for any prayers you can contribute.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

Any help is appreciated with hearfelt gratitude.  Should monetary assistance not be possible, I understand, as we are having a tough time too with medical  bills and everything else.....if dollars are not possible, I repectfully ask for any prayers you can contribute.

Rainwater Harvesting tank for Eugemot Orphanage in Ghana. The children
currently fetch water from a stream and use it for drinking, bathing, cleaning,
and cooking. The water they fetch is a light brown color. Many of the children
suffer from skin rashes and ailments and other health problems due to improper
sanitation conditions. I want to get this water tank for them in order to
improve their quality of life by improving their health and sanitation
conditions. </p>
<p>I visited Ghana last
summer and volunteered at a rural family health clinic. I went to the Orphanage

should have access to clean drinking water. Your donations will make that a
reality for these children.  </p>

We are fortunate to have a family cottage on a peaceful, quiet lake surrounded by 3 acres of mature forest.  The century old log cottage is rustic thiand authentic and nurtures the body and spirit.  We've owned this cottage for 10 years now.  The previous owners who had loved it for over 32 years had called the cottage their ""Little Piece of Paradise"".</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We would love to donate time at our piece of paradise to families of cancer survivors through the Cottage Dreams loan program and to families with loved ones who are wheelchair dependent.</div>

<div>For those of you who are fortunate enough to have a cottage get away, you will already know how magical it is to just spend time looking out at nature, at times spottig small or big wildlife, and sharing meals in the great outdoors.  We are very fortunate to own a uniquely rustic, century old log cottage that wraps its visitors in warm and lulls them to relax, and get refocused on the truly meaningful things in life of time with loved ones.</div>

<p></p>
<p>More people die each year from unsafe water than from all forms of violence, including war. To put an end to such avoidable deaths, it is imperative to supply clean, potable water to those who have no access to it. This, in turn, will slow and eventually stop the spread of water born diseases and make a serious dent in the 5 million deaths per year caused by water related diseases. Each well provides water for about 500 people for 20 years, and we'll also provide hygiene and sanitation education to the youth and women of the village in order to help ensure the projects sustainability. </p>
<p>Water is a fundamental human need. Each person on Earth requires at least 20 to 50 liters of clean, safe water a day for drinking, cooking, and simply keeping themselves clean.</p>
<p>Polluted water isn’t just dirty—it’s deadly. Some 1.8 million people die every year of <a href=""http://www.drinking-water.org/html/en/glossary.html#gloss38"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">diarrheal diseases</a> like<a href=""http://www.drinking-water.org/html/en/glossary.html#gloss23"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">cholera</a>. Tens of millions of others are seriously sickened by a host of water-related ailments—many of which are easily preventable.</p>
<p>I have traveled through a lot of the world but Africa has always been on my list of place to go when I had a really good reason. So when E.P.I.C (Everyday people initiating change) invited me to be one of 8 people to build a clean water well I said YES immediately. I've already bought my ticket, the three thousand is for the well and to see where We can be of assistance around the villages.  Little things go a long way, and just to know that we as a human family have each others back is a huge thing. I do these types of things every where I go including in Los Angeles and the feedback is always the same, people are blown away that people still care. So this is our opportunity to do it in Africa. One of the main points I want to stress is that, this is not charity for the ""poor africans"", this is family doing what family should do when people don't have basic needs like water and proper sanitation. People often ask me what I'm willing to die for and this is something that I'm willing to put my life on the line for. We must stand up and be living examples of the good/change we wish to see in this world. </p>

I am the son of Ms. Jane Seidel. I have decided to create a fund for my mother called ""Purple Kisses and Kidneys"". Some of you may know that she is in the midst of kidney failure and is suffering from a rare kidney disease called Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis.
Ms. Jane is Director of Washington Catholic's Early Childhood Program as well as the head preschool teacher at the school. She has been involved in the program for 15 years allowing the early childhood of the town to flourish into something magnificent. 
She picked up a second job as a waitress at the local country club to help save money for her expenses. She also tutors children with the little amount of free time that she can make.
 She has done so much for the community of Washington, Indiana. She has touched so many lives and I am proud to call her my mother. This is a way for people to help her in her time of need. She is constantly donating her time as a helping hand and I hope to see this foundation excel.    Donations There are countless expenses involved for Ms. Jane's situation
The funding is set at a small goal of $1500. I hope to coordinate much more money and contributors may donate after the goal is achieved.
 Surgery costs, doctor visits, room costs, etc.
 Ms. Jane will be out of work for some time so the expenses will be hard to cover.

<h4>1.  What are the essential criteria for a good toothbrush?</h4>
<p></p>
<p><b>High Cleaning
     Efficacy</b>: Bristle tips should have positive displacement to get the job
     done.  Many vibrating or oscillating type toothbrush bristle tip have
     large stagnation areas in their motion, therefore reducing their cleaning
     efficacy.  Helix's continuous circular motion guarantee
     positive displacement.  <a href=""http://www.dentistry.bham.ac.uk/dentalultrasonics/docs/DentalHealthToothbrushes.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bristle Tip Displacement Article</a></p>
<p><b>Over brushing
     protection:</b> over brushing is the 2nd largest cause of gum recession.
     Helix's Haptic Overbrushing Feedback Protection warn the user when too
     much pressure is about to be applied.</p>
<b>Gentle:</b> There have been complaints of people becoming nauseous
     during use of power toothbrushes that vibrate.  Helix’s circular
     motion not only does a great job cleaning, but also saves energy.<br/><b><br/>Easy to recharge</b>: Helix is the only toothbrush that can be directly charged from any USB
     port.  And one charge lasts
     30 days.<b><br/><br/>Tongue
     cleaner</b>: The tongue is a huge harbor of microorganisms.  The
     Helix has dedicated tongue cleaners that break up and break loose the
     colonies on your tongue.<b><br/><br/>Water resistant:</b> Many electric toothbrushes fail when water enters the internal mechanism. 
     Helix is water resistant. <br/><br/><p><b>Timer:</b> 
Helix
has 2-minute timer to ensure sufficient cleaning time is achieved.

     done.  Many vibrating or oscillating type toothbrush bristle tip have
     large stagnation areas in their motion, therefore reducing their cleaning
     efficacy.  Helix's continuous circular motion guarantee
     positive displacement.  Bristle Tip Displacement Article
Over brushing
     protection: over brushing is the 2nd largest cause of gum recession.
     Helix's Haptic Overbrushing Feedback Protection warn the user when too
     much pressure is about to be applied.
Gentle: There have been complaints of people becoming nauseous
     during use of power toothbrushes that vibrate.  Helix’s circular
     motion not only does a great job cleaning, but also saves energy.Easy to recharge: Helix is the only toothbrush that can be directly charged from any USB
     port.  And one charge lasts
     30 days.Tongue
     cleaner: The tongue is a huge harbor of microorganisms.  The
     Helix has dedicated tongue cleaners that break up and break loose the
     colonies on your tongue.Water resistant: Many electric toothbrushes fail when water enters the internal mechanism. 
     Helix is water resistant. Timer: 
Helix
has 2-minute timer to ensure sufficient cleaning time is achieved. 




   
 Manufacturing and Assembly:The Helix pushes the envelope of manufacturing technology. Many components were vetted through dozens of companies before they could be reliably made. Some critical components have multiple backup suppliers that are ready on short-notice. We have chosen an experienced team of reputable manufacturing vendors that are working together to bring the Helix to our backers.Shipping and Customs:Lithium Ion Batteries are surprisingly difficult to transport quickly, and shipments sometimes get delayed. We have sourced multiple reliable carriers and worked out timelines to have the Helix to be shipped by July 2015.  Unfortunately we will be unable to ship to Germany, Italy, and Laos.Schedule:Late April  - Launch Indiegogo for 40 days May 2015  - Fine tune of molds, jigs, fixtures, tests and SOPs June 2015  - Enters pilot run and advance to mass production  (Manufacturing, Receiving Inspection and Assembly) July  2015  - Packaging and Shipping",37.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>Our world's population is ageing fast. According to the United Nations, global population aged 60 and above is growing at a faster rate than the total population. With an ageing population it will come with mental challenges like dementia. In fact, it is estimated that 46.8 million people worldwide currently have dementia and is set to double every 20 years, reaching 74.7 million by 2030.

<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div>
<p><b>1. PRODUCT</b></p>
<p><b>1a: How will the Neeuro SenzeBand and Neeuro Memorie App help me? </b></p>
<p>It is a brain training solution that works together; regular use of which will enhance your attention, decision making, memory, multitasking and spatial skills.</p>
<p><b>1b. How does the Neeuro SenzeBand work? Is it safe?</b></p>
<p>With its four front EEG sensors and two reference sensor electrodes, the headband accurately reads the brain's cognitive signals. The sensors use highly conductive elastomers, which capture very low frequency signals. When the headband is placed around your forehead, it records your brain's activity and senses its overall health. It is non-intrusive and safe to use, with no current or electromagnetic waves that will be sent into your brain. The Neeuro Senzeband has been internationally certified with FCC, IC and CE.<br/></p>
<p><b>1c. What is EEG and how does it work? </b></p>
<p>Electroencephalogram, or EEG, records the brain's electrical activity, through electrodes attached outside of the head, which then transforms the electrical activity into patterns, called brain waves. Read more <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/eeg/basics/definition/prc-20014093"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<p><b>1d. Is there scientific basis for EEG (electroencephalogram)? </b></p>
<p>Yes. An EEG test is done to check brain activity and diagnose problems in the brain or in the nervous system. Read more on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p><b>1e. What is the Neeuro Memorie App? </b></p>
<p>It is a game app best used with the Neeuro SenzeBand. It contains 15 games plus regular new games to be introduced, which are designed to train different aspects of the brain's cognitive functions - attention, memory, multitasking, spatial and decision-making skills. Memorie evaluates your performance, and guides you through the lively games to achieve the desired results. Read more <a href=""http://www.neeuro.com/memorie/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>
<p><b>1f. Why is the Neeuro Memorie App not free like in most wearable devices? </b></p>
<p>This is the paid version of the app that comes along with the Neeuro SenzeBand. It will contain 15 games as a start and more games will be released regularly. You will be enjoying continual upgrades and frequent new games with this package.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>2. SCIENCE</b></p>
<p><b>2a. What is the science behind this? How do I know if this works?</b></p>
<p>Research in this field is on-going and there have been positive results based on certain conditions. We are in the midst of doing our own studies and have compiled a science whitepaper and an animated science explainer video for easy understanding. View them <a href=""http://www.neeuro.com/science/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>
<p>Training for a few hours across a wide variety of brain functions like in some studies, would most likely not gain any real-world benefits in the same way as going to the gym a couple of times per month and doing undirected exercises. It has to be targeted and consistently done.</p>
<p><b>2b. How often do I need to play the games to see an improvement? </b></p>
<p>Based on existing research such as the <a href=""http://gazzaleylab.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Anguera_Nature_2013-Video-game-training-enhances-cognitive-control-in-older-adults.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nature publication</a> [PDF] in 2013, we recommend play to be at least 15-20 minutes per day.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>2c: Who is this suitable for?</b></p>
<p>We want a solution that is suitable for as wide an audience as possible starting from 6 years onwards. If someone already has cognitive decline or a brain condition, we recommend that you consult your doctor first. Just like exercising in a gym will not guarantee that you will not get a heart attack, we cannot claim that using our solution will guarantee that you will not experience cognitive decline or brain diseases.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>3. PURCHASE &amp; SETUP</b></p>
<p><b>3a: Do I need one headband for each person in my family? Or is this sharable?</b></p>
<p>The Neeuro SenzeBand is sharable, but there will be no individual scores for you to track and thus the analytics for that account will not be useful. This is not ideal if you want to have own tracking of performance. We recommend that you consider backing the Neeuro Duo or Neeuro Family perks if you want to have more than one person use it.</p>
<p><b>3b: What colors does this come in?</b></p>
<p>We currently only have a white version. However, we would love to hear your feedback on other colors you would prefer, so email us at support@neeuro.com to let us know! </p>
<p><b>3c: How easily can I set this up?</b></p>
<p>You need to download and install Neeuro Memorie when it’s released. Then go to the settings option in the app and click “Device”. Make sure Bluetooth is enabled on your device. Pair the app with the Neeuro SenzeBand by clicking the “Add Device” button. Once it’s connected, you’re ready to go play the games!</p>
<p><b>3d: What if I have any troubles with my product or software?</b></p>
<p>If you face any issues with the product or software, please reach out to us at: <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">support@neeuro.com</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>3e: How do I know if the Neeuro SenzeBand can fit on my head comfortably?</b></p>
<p>The headband can be extended to different sizes. You can adjust it by pulling out the band that goes over your forehead until the reference hook fits comfortably at the back of your ears. Make sure the electrodes are placed at the centre of your forehead. It will fit head sizes with a circumference between 20 to 24 inches (51 to 61 cm).</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>4. BUYING &amp; SHIPPING</b></p>

We exercise to keep ourselves physically fit and healthy, to reduce the risk of diseases like heart attacks and strokes. We are able to do the same for our brains. 
Neeuro's solution is a combination of a mobile application containing games and a headband that monitors brainwaves. These games, designed by neuroscientists, game developers and data scientists, are played to stimulate and strengthen the mind.






The mobile application Neeuro Memorie, which works on both tablets and mobile phones, paired with the headband Neeuro SenzeBand, creates a unique combination that effectively measures brain activities for mind stimulation. This combination helps in the following cognitive functions:






  






Although there are some controversy about the ""brain training"" applications out there, science has proven that you are able to increase your ""fluid intelligence"" that can help you be faster and smarter in solving new problems. Think about how Sherlock Holmes solves crimes! 



Bestselling author Barbara Bradley Hagerty, who wrote the article, Forget About It: Your Middle-Aged Brain is Not on the Decline, discusses her 75% improvement in fluid intelligence after one month of a brain training game called n-back conducted by researchers at the University of Maryland.

She concludes that the middle-aged brain can still get smarter with new and challenging tasks.

The Neeuro SenzeBand, a sleek, easy-to-use wearable, paired with games designed by neuroscientists, does just that from the comfort of your home.
Our equivalent game is called Sushi Recall that engages players in a fun way to think faster and improve memory and attention, which is our fluid intelligence.



This animation gives you a peek into the science behind brain training:






Studies have shown that our brain's performance peaks in the early 20s and the decline begins towards the late 20s. This decline is linear as we advance in age beyond our twenties. With proper brain training, this decline can be delayed, thereby improving cognitive performance.

Neeuro Memorie uses games to stimulate the brain’s cognitive function in the areas of attention, decision making, memory, multitasking and spatial skills. These games are designed based on neuroscience to ensure focus on the specific cognitive skills.
By playing fun games, the EEG-based Neeuro SenzeBand reads your brain waves and tracks your progress, gives feedback for improvement. With the Neeuro SenzeBand, too, you can control the games with your thoughts, giving it a mind-controlling feature not present with other headbands and training game apps.


Neeuro helps you get back to the basics of mind wellness, and giving you the ultimate brain training experience.
Unlike most brain training applications, Neeuro Memorie uses an EEG headband, called Neeuro SenzeBand, to monitor brain activities during game play. The Neeuro SenzeBand measures brain activities for proper brain stimulation.
Simply put on Neeuro SenzeBand, pair it up with Memorie and start playing the games. Play it yourself, with children, parents, grandparents and all your loved ones; or enjoy it as a family.







For an effective brain training, spend a minimum of 15 minutes a day playing the games. Over time you will see an improvement in your cognitive performance. 


Track your performance in the games and understand your overall cognition in the areas of Memory, Attention, Spatial Skills, Multitasking and Decision Making. 


Children too, can play the cognitive games that are designed to be fun and entertaining.  They will be stimulating their minds and giving themselves all the opportunities to enhance their cognitive abilities.


Neeuro Memorie will have 15 games when released. This video highlights 5 games:


On top of that, there will also be games that require you to use your attention in order to control the games!

The MindCopter game trains you in attention and focus.  You have to concentrate and pay attention to enable the helicopter to fly.

The Psychic Cyclist game makes you practice to stay focused, so you can control the bicycle moving forward.













  
















A perfect companion to the Neeuro SenzeBand, this sleek casing can hold the headband for safe keeping and travel. Stylish yet practical.
Designed specially for the Neeuro SenzeBand and all the accessories, this will give your peace of mind when you keep your headband whether for daily use or otherwise.
Get the Neeuro SenzeBand case, by adding the Casing Perk for it. 







During game play, Neeuro Memorie continuously measures and evaluates your performance through the Neeuro Learning Matrix (NLM). This is a key differentiation of Neeuro’s Memorie.
The patent pending system and method, NLM, provides a concise analysis for behavioural and mental stages while training your brain with the Neeuro Memorie games.
Find out more information about the NLM here.



 

We set out to change the way people perceive using wearable technology that incorporates measuring brainwaves. We wanted a brain training solution that is easy, accessible and affordable for everyone. The following table shows comparisons with other brain training alternatives:
























Our world's population is ageing fast. According to the United Nations, global population aged 60 and above is growing at a faster rate than the total population. With an ageing population it will come with mental challenges like dementia. In fact, it is estimated that 46.8 million people worldwide currently have dementia and is set to double every 20 years, reaching 74.7 million by 2030. The estimated cost of dementia is US$818 billion in 2015.



Neeuro strongly believes that early diagnosis and early intervention are key mechanisms that can close this treatment gap. It's always better to seek preventive methods rather than to find a cure. 


   

At Neeuro, we want to be part of this solution towards addressing this challenge, as with many nations addressing an ageing population under Smart Nation and Smart City initiatives. At the same time, we want to reach out and provide our solution to as many people as possible.


Neeuro is a social enterprise and a member of Singapore Centre for Social Enterprise “raiSE”. Neeuro’s mind stimulation solution has a social mission as the company resolves to aid seniors, care centers, communities and health service providers with brain training.







Neeuro has done all its research and have spent over 2 years creating this mind stimulation solution. We would like to reach out to users to help make it even better. With more users, we will be able to do much more, push its accuracy even further and discover even more with what we can do with our minds. 
The Neeuro SenzeBand and Neeuro Memorie will retail for US$299 and US$149 respectively. For this campaign, we want you to be part of what we do and support our cause. In doing so, especially for this period, we will give the Neeuro SenzeBand for FREE.



















We have assembled an incredible team of people, consisting of designers, engineers, neuroscientists, industry experts, marketeers and PR practitioners that all have a common vision to create the best product for mind stimulation.











We have been working on Neeuro products for the past two years, we have done various prototypes and tests. Now, we have finalised our working prototypes and we currently are in the final stages of:


Finalising the detailed engineering schematics for the final product.
Iterating on the user experience of the mobile application.
Developing and iterating more games so that users will have continual upgrades to new games.

We will begin the process of:

Designing the packaging.
Preparing to get product certifications.
Planning out the supply chain process to ensure the materials are ready for production.
Tooling. 
Procuring materials.
Production.




We've come a long way since we had a vision for Neeuro when it was founded in 2013.  It had been a journey of discovery, fact finding, facing different challenges and iterating our designs and methodologies until we got them right. But now we need your help. Your support will allow us to go to the next phase of our project that will help kick start the manufacturing process.  


We want to make Neeuro Memorie and Neeuro SenzeBand available to you and everyone who wants to start having healthier minds through brain training. Allowing you and your loved ones to keep their minds active, understand their cognitive performance and head towards a healthier mind. Let's make this project a success so that we can give back to communities, helping us, as a social enterprise  support those that need help with their mental well being. Let's do this together! 


Why support us?



Be the first to get it!
You've always wanted to help yourself or your loved ones improve their cognitive functions.
You always wanted a product that can measure your brainwaves and use them in a meaningful manner to enhance your cognition.
Help us to give back to communities that need help on mental well being.

7. OTHER QUESTIONS



1. PRODUCT
1a: How will the Neeuro SenzeBand and Neeuro Memorie App help me? 
It is a brain training solution that works together; regular use of which will enhance your attention, decision making, memory, multitasking and spatial skills.
1b. How does the Neeuro SenzeBand work? Is it safe?
With its four front EEG sensors and two reference sensor electrodes, the headband accurately reads the brain's cognitive signals. The sensors use highly conductive elastomers, which capture very low frequency signals. When the headband is placed around your forehead, it records your brain's activity and senses its overall health. It is non-intrusive and safe to use, with no current or electromagnetic waves that will be sent into your brain. The Neeuro Senzeband has been internationally certified with FCC, IC and CE.
1c. What is EEG and how does it work? 
Electroencephalogram, or EEG, records the brain's electrical activity, through electrodes attached outside of the head, which then transforms the electrical activity into patterns, called brain waves. Read more here.
1d. Is there scientific basis for EEG (electroencephalogram)? 
Yes. An EEG test is done to check brain activity and diagnose problems in the brain or in the nervous system. Read more on Wikipedia.
1e. What is the Neeuro Memorie App? 
It is a game app best used with the Neeuro SenzeBand. It contains 15 games plus regular new games to be introduced, which are designed to train different aspects of the brain's cognitive functions - attention, memory, multitasking, spatial and decision-making skills. Memorie evaluates your performance, and guides you through the lively games to achieve the desired results. Read more here.
1f. Why is the Neeuro Memorie App not free like in most wearable devices? 
This is the paid version of the app that comes along with the Neeuro SenzeBand. It will contain 15 games as a start and more games will be released regularly. You will be enjoying continual upgrades and frequent new games with this package.


2. SCIENCE
2a. What is the science behind this? How do I know if this works?
Research in this field is on-going and there have been positive results based on certain conditions. We are in the midst of doing our own studies and have compiled a science whitepaper and an animated science explainer video for easy understanding. View them here.
Training for a few hours across a wide variety of brain functions like in some studies, would most likely not gain any real-world benefits in the same way as going to the gym a couple of times per month and doing undirected exercises. It has to be targeted and consistently done.
2b. How often do I need to play the games to see an improvement? 
Based on existing research such as the Nature publication [PDF] in 2013, we recommend play to be at least 15-20 minutes per day.

2c: Who is this suitable for?
We want a solution that is suitable for as wide an audience as possible starting from 6 years onwards. If someone already has cognitive decline or a brain condition, we recommend that you consult your doctor first. Just like exercising in a gym will not guarantee that you will not get a heart attack, we cannot claim that using our solution will guarantee that you will not experience cognitive decline or brain diseases.

3. PURCHASE & SETUP
3a: Do I need one headband for each person in my family? Or is this sharable?
The Neeuro SenzeBand is sharable, but there will be no individual scores for you to track and thus the analytics for that account will not be useful. This is not ideal if you want to have own tracking of performance. We recommend that you consider backing the Neeuro Duo or Neeuro Family perks if you want to have more than one person use it.
3b: What colors does this come in?
We currently only have a white version. However, we would love to hear your feedback on other colors you would prefer, so email us at support@neeuro.com to let us know! 
3c: How easily can I set this up?
You need to download and install Neeuro Memorie when it’s released. Then go to the settings option in the app and click “Device”. Make sure Bluetooth is enabled on your device. Pair the app with the Neeuro SenzeBand by clicking the “Add Device” button. Once it’s connected, you’re ready to go play the games!
3d: What if I have any troubles with my product or software?
If you face any issues with the product or software, please reach out to us at: support@neeuro.com

3e: How do I know if the Neeuro SenzeBand can fit on my head comfortably?
The headband can be extended to different sizes. You can adjust it by pulling out the band that goes over your forehead until the reference hook fits comfortably at the back of your ears. Make sure the electrodes are placed at the centre of your forehead. It will fit head sizes with a circumference between 20 to 24 inches (51 to 61 cm).

<p>Our goal was to design a device that anybody can easily use. We intend to give a product that is available to everyone and which helps in the prevention of life threatening diseases like Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA) and Afib-related Stroke.</p>
<p>What we created helps to give people confidence that their heart is in good condition so they don’t have to worry about it.</p>
<h1>How it works?</h1>
<p><b>The WIWE system consists of two parts:  </b></p>
<ul>
<li>The WIWE device  </li>
<li>WIWE application</li>
</ul>
<p>WIWE’s main function is recoding ECG, the electrical activity of the heart over a period of time. For this it uses the first limb lead (Lead I), meaning that the device evaluates the voltage between the left arm (positive electrode) and the right arm (negative electrode).</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452522748/xypmtzsohupwsihamtpz.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The time period for recording in the case of WIWE is 60 seconds. That’s around 60 cardiac cycles for a person in a calm environment.</p>
<h1>The WIWE device</h1>
<p>Is a cardiological diagnostic device. Its priority is evaluating the risk of Atrial Fibrillation and if there is a change in Ventricular Heterogenity. For this we use a unique and worldwide new method.  </p>
<p>You can also measure your Blood Oxygen Level and Heart Rate when you record your ECG.</p>
<p>On top of these we wanted WIWE to also function as a pedometer. You can record the steps you take, the calories you burn and there are exciting badges and milestones waiting for you.</p>
<p><b>Recording with WIWE is as easy as 1-2-3:</b></p>

<p>They wanted to create something, that could be efficent in preventing Sudden Cardiac Arrest and Afib-related Stroke. For this they needed a risk calculation algorithm which can evaluate if there is a risk for Atrial Fibrillation or change in the Ventricular Heterogenity. After this came the idea to use not 12 Lead just One Bipolar lead for measuring the above stated risks and using a phone for checking the results of the recordings. This was the basic concept of WIWE. The part of Gregory in the project is the development of the WIWE ECG/SpO2 signal processing and evaluating modules and the testing of the applied atrial fibrillation detection algorithm on reference ECG signals.</p>

</div><p></p><br/><p></p><p><br/></p></div>","Introducing WIWEWIWE is a pocket device that is thin, easy-to-use and evaluates your ECG to detect serious medical conditions as well as helps you live a healthier life. It works either with smartphones or tablets.

Easy to use: and easy to wear. It only takes 60 seconds to record your ECG and it’s the same size as a business card holder.


It does it all: you can take ownership of your health with it’s built in functions like the pedometer, pulse oximeter and calorie counter.


Prevention: at it’s best. Our main goal is to ask people to take care of their heart and body before it’s too late.

Real time capturing: of your ECG and evaluating the risks of a sudden cardiac arrest and afib-related stroke.


About Stroke and Sudden Cardiac Arrest:

According to WHO (World Health Organization) 15 million people suffer from a stroke wolrdwide each year.
Out of them 5 million die and other 5 million becomes permanently disabled.
CVD (Cardiovascular Disease, a class of diseases that involve the heart or blood vessels) is the leading cause of global mortality, accounting for almost 17 million deaths annually (30 % of all global mortality).
40-50 % of these are Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD) and 80 % of these are Ventricular Fibrillation/Tachycardia (VF/VT)

Who is WIWE for?
For Managers: 
Stressful days, working late and having less and less time. WIWE only takes a minute to take care of your health and it tells you if there is something you should deal with now.
For Athletes:


Just going forward, keep getting better and better and no time for stopping or letting loose. You can use WIWE anytime, anywhere to make sure, that your heart keeps up with you.
For Seniors:



As we grow older so do the risks of Heart Diseases. With WIWE it's easy for anybody to check if everything is fine.People taking care of the elderly:



Taking care of our elderly even if we can't be with them. With a built-in option to share it's easy to see our parents’ recordings from afar.
Health-conscious people:


WIWE shows us that we did enough for our body at the end of each day. Tracking how many calories you burn and how many steps you take has never been so easy.
Caring mothers:


Knowing that we can take care of our children for a long time still. Because WIWE helps us to prevent serious Heart Diseases.



Our goal was to design a device that anybody can easily use. We intend to give a product that is available to everyone and which helps in the prevention of life threatening diseases like Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA) and Afib-related Stroke.
What we created helps to give people confidence that their heart is in good condition so they don’t have to worry about it.
How it works?
The WIWE system consists of two parts:  

The WIWE device  
WIWE application

WIWE’s main function is recoding ECG, the electrical activity of the heart over a period of time. For this it uses the first limb lead (Lead I), meaning that the device evaluates the voltage between the left arm (positive electrode) and the right arm (negative electrode).


The time period for recording in the case of WIWE is 60 seconds. That’s around 60 cardiac cycles for a person in a calm environment.
The WIWE device
Is a cardiological diagnostic device. Its priority is evaluating the risk of Atrial Fibrillation and if there is a change in Ventricular Heterogenity. For this we use a unique and worldwide new method.  
You can also measure your Blood Oxygen Level and Heart Rate when you record your ECG.
On top of these we wanted WIWE to also function as a pedometer. You can record the steps you take, the calories you burn and there are exciting badges and milestones waiting for you.
Recording with WIWE is as easy as 1-2-3:


Put and keep your 2 fingertips on the electrodes  
Wait 60 seconds until the app says you can release  
Look through the evaluation screen presented to you

Important details of the evaluation:  
Ventricular Heterogenity (VH):  

WIWE analyzes the ingerated value of the QRST 
If these differ in the cardiac cycles, then there is a change in Ventricular Heterogenity

Atrial Fibrillation (AF):

It makes a Poincaré graph based on the R to R intervals  
Evaluates the variability of the length of intervals

The WIWE application
We wanted to put as much as we can into the application, yet keep it easy to use.


Evaluation screen:

ECG (ElectroCardioGraphy) button shows, if there is any abnormality in the majority ECG waveform  
AF (Atrial Fibrillation) button shows, if there is a risk for Afib-related Stroke
VH (Ventricular Heterogenity) button shows, if there is a risk for Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA)
Under these you can find your Blood Oxygen Level (SpO2) and Heart Rate (Bpm)

The WIWE device also functions as a pedometer:



Recording the steps you take  
Counting the calories you burned
WIWE has graphs and statistics about your activity


And there are interesting milestones for motivation
Please note for this to work the most precise way, detailed personal information are available under your user profile (Weight, Height, Age, etc.).
How we got here

Professor George Kozmann
The idea itself came from a famous Hungarian scientist, George Kozmann, professor (University of Pannonia), head of the Centre for Medical Informatics Research & Development, Faculty of Information Technology, Veszprém and his assistant, Gregory Tuboly (University of Pannonia, Faculty of Information Technology, Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Systems).


Gregory Tuboly
They wanted to create something, that could be efficent in preventing Sudden Cardiac Arrest and Afib-related Stroke. For this they needed a risk calculation algorithm which can evaluate if there is a risk for Atrial Fibrillation or change in the Ventricular Heterogenity. After this came the idea to use not 12 Lead just One Bipolar lead for measuring the above stated risks and using a phone for checking the results of the recordings. This was the basic concept of WIWE. The part of Gregory in the project is the development of the WIWE ECG/SpO2 signal processing and evaluating modules and the testing of the applied atrial fibrillation detection algorithm on reference ECG signals.

He said: „We tried for a long time in both Hardware and Software to make something that is capable of everything we wanted”.

„As we are starting to reach our goal the final concept is becoming clearer and clearer, although there were many prototypes on the way.”


We are working hard on both the software and hardware to solve every issue, but now we need your help!

Designed by a dad for all anxious parents who struggle with child's fever, Earmo wants to help you get your child recover as quickly and easily as possible. Earmo help you read accurate temperatures in 1 second. Adorable emoticons according to temperature readings set you and your baby at ease. It's also readable at night so no more fiddling with a smartphone light to see the temperature readings in the dark. 1 Second For Results = 1 Less Fussy BabyMeet Earmo, a completely upgraded experience from your old thermometers. It only takes 1 sec to get a reading instead of 3 mins, and you can view past results and current results clearly on its large LED display. Embedded with a highly sensitive infrared temperature sensor, Earmo enhances the response and has an accuracy of ±0.4℉ / ±0.2℃.Easy to View at Night
With Earmo’s intuitive screen automatically lighting up in a dim environment, you don’t have to wake your sick baby up and cause them to cry at night. Woo-hoo. Another peaceful night towards full recovery.Swipe to Compare with Previous Temps
You have already measured the baby’s temperature five times in an hour to make sure if the temperature is dropping. If you have more than one child, most likely you'll forget a temperature even if you took it 5 minutes ago. Earmo displays up to 5 readings. A swipe on the LED touchscreen reveals one temperature at a time.Get Suggestions to Combat FeverIt's hard to find a doctor willing to take a call at 3 in the morning, and going through tons of articles on Google isn't exactly your best option. With our Earmo app, you can get instant tips on what you should do next to help your baby. Another cool feature: You can share all the baby's recovery progress to your doctor immediately via text messaging or email.  Safe, Hygienic, and Saves Your MoneyNo lens filters are needed equals to No More “I run out of lens filters” or “I need to go to CVS to get extra filters” moments. It’s easy to disinfect with just an alcohol wipe. Without an invasive probe tip and lens filters, Earmo’s ABS plastic probe works as gentle and safe as possible to make taking temperatures easier than before. The probe tip is also smaller so it fits in the baby’s ears without too much ear pulling.Smiley Emoticons for EncouragementTaking care of your baby when they're sick is stressful. The high-temperature numbers can be scary, and we want to give some positive reinforcement. It's a great feeling when that frowny face turns into a happy one! Enhance Your Entire Family’s WellnessFrom kids to adults, Earmo can be used for tracking all your family’s health status and having health suggestions ready. If you have more than one child, you can separate every reading on the app, so it doesn't get mixed up. That way you can monitor every child's health. Adam Lou, CEO of Bongmi, plays with his son. Courtesy of Bongmi.When his wife was pregnant a year ago, Adam Lou, the CEO of Bongmi, wanted a thermometer that was accurate, safe, fast, and would not disturb his sick or sleepy son while taking temperatures. After a year of hard work, Earmo has arrived. With a shape of jade, Earmo draws comfort from its gentle surface when you hold it. Earmo’s revolutionary interface, which allows you to read previous temperature on the surface of the thermometer, brings the best user experiences in both the product and application.Earmo is built with kids in mind. Just like Adam designs Earmo from his care for his upcoming baby, Earmo wants to bring the fast and accurate measurements to you and your beloved children with your supports.Amy from Baby League, a YouTube hub of mommy Bloggers with 443,162 subscribers, shares her helpful hacks, including Earmo, taking care of sick kids. Let’s watch how Earmo becomes a game-changer for moms to manage children’s health.  The method of temperature reading – on a LED glass screen - has not changed since the first electronic clinical thermometer was invented in 1954. Even on so-called “smart” ear thermometers.We believe that the word smart in the ear thermometer industry calls for a revolutionary design that gives you a peace of mind. Earmo was designed to address your need for easy, accurate and convenient temperature reading without missing one tiny change on the thermometer.No need to take notes on your little one’s temperature. No need to wait your thermometer-compatible app receives the readings via Bluetooth. No need to guess if the temperature is declining. By swiping on the LED Screen, Earmo reads the past 5 sets of temperature instantly. We are Bongmi, the creator of Femometer, a smart fertility tracker. We launched Femometer Indiegogo campaign last year and raised $92, 730, which is over 240% funded. Thanks to our supporting community of backers, we continue evolving technologies to enhance wellness for every family.

<p>Me in the middle with my two amazing brothers!</p>
<p class=""ecxMsoNormal""><span><span class=""ecxapple-style-span"">My name is Vanessa<span>.</span> I am a graduate from McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario<span>,</span> where I received my Bachelor of Commerce, majoring in human resources. I have lived in Canada my entire 22 years, have a wonderful loving family, a true passion for animals and a strong desire to travel the world. I have always had an urge to start something big, something that will effect other's in a positive way and here I have found my calling.</span><br/><span class=""ecxapple-style-span"">This is where my story begins...</span></span></p>
<h3><strong><span>WHY am I doing This?</span></strong></h3>
<p class=""ecxMsoNormal""><span><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/77_22530665384_1138_n.jpg"" id=""ecx_x0000_i1025"" src="""" style=""""/><span class=""ecxapple-style-span"">Not too long ago a close family member of mine (my cousin Franky) was diagnosed with gastric cancer (cancer of the stomach). This is a very serious type of cancer and a difficult one to fight as it is often found at a later stage due to a lack of symptoms. At the prime of his life, my cousin was planned to be married and start his life with his new bride, but plans were quickly put on hold. Plans of having the time of his life were now turned to enduring the fight of his life. Surgery was immediately scheduled at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre to have 2/3 of his stomach removed. He was put into the caring and skilled hands of the surgeons at Sunnybrook and thankfully his surgery was successful. But his fight had just begun with a year ahead of chemotherapy and radiation. They say when someone is struck with cancer it effects the entire family as well as friends and I was now seeing this with my own eyes. With this tragic occurrence and the fighting battle that my cousin still has to endure I found a calling within me to start something special with my cousin in my heart.</span></span></p>

If my goal is reached, I will contribute a portion of the funds to help cover medical expenses. Franky is scheduled to be off work for more than one year and unfortunately expenses are adding up as the chemotherapy treatment which he is receiving is not covered by health care. </span></p>

The Tree of Life
About Me

Me in the middle with my two amazing brothers!
My name is Vanessa. I am a graduate from McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, where I received my Bachelor of Commerce, majoring in human resources. I have lived in Canada my entire 22 years, have a wonderful loving family, a true passion for animals and a strong desire to travel the world. I have always had an urge to start something big, something that will effect other's in a positive way and here I have found my calling.This is where my story begins...
WHY am I doing This?
Not too long ago a close family member of mine (my cousin Franky) was diagnosed with gastric cancer (cancer of the stomach). This is a very serious type of cancer and a difficult one to fight as it is often found at a later stage due to a lack of symptoms. At the prime of his life, my cousin was planned to be married and start his life with his new bride, but plans were quickly put on hold. Plans of having the time of his life were now turned to enduring the fight of his life. Surgery was immediately scheduled at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre to have 2/3 of his stomach removed. He was put into the caring and skilled hands of the surgeons at Sunnybrook and thankfully his surgery was successful. But his fight had just begun with a year ahead of chemotherapy and radiation. They say when someone is struck with cancer it effects the entire family as well as friends and I was now seeing this with my own eyes. With this tragic occurrence and the fighting battle that my cousin still has to endure I found a calling within me to start something special with my cousin in my heart.
Where do the funds go?
I have chosen the Odette Cancer Center at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, where a majority of the contributions of this campaign will go. If my goal is reached, I will contribute a portion of the funds to help cover medical expenses. Franky is scheduled to be off work for more than one year and unfortunately expenses are adding up as the chemotherapy treatment which he is receiving is not covered by health care. 

  Marta is another beautiful young individual who was diagnosed with stage IV stomach cancer just this year at age 30. I met her through my cousin (via internet) as he was in search of support from others who were going through the same battle as himself (its very unusual for someone so young to have gastric cancer). Marta calls herself and others facing cancer ‘warriors’ and she plans to kick cancers butt!! She has made a blog to inspire those to have strength and courage even when the odds are against them. Feel free to visit her blog page at www.diaryofaprettyface.com and her donation page to help cover her medical costs at http://www.youcaring.com/fundraiser_details?fundraiser_id=7338&url=teammarta.
 
       ""Give what you have. To someone, it may be better than you dare to think.""
                         - Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807 - 1882)
What is the Tree of Life?
The Tree of Life is my symbolic beginning to the campaign as I start to raise funds for the Odette Cancer Center. The Tree of Life defines an expression of life through a tree's growth, its trunk, its long growing branches and leaves and the various colours it goes through in each season with its connection to the Earth. I want the Tree of Life to represent growing and healing within ourselves and for it to be a reminder of how we are connected to the Earth – that we are all one and we are forever growing. This bracelet will be used to symbolize The Tree of Life and will be black in colour.
My goal is to raise $15,000 and to one day see these bracelets all across North America. When we see these bracelets we will be reminded of life, health and healing. To encourage this and promote the campaign, a number of perks will be available for everyone! Each perk has its unique offer allowing for more Tree of Life bracelets. 
          ""We make a living by what we get, we make a life by what we give.""
                                   - Sir Winston Churchill (1874 - 1965)
What YOU Get!!

This is what the silver and black Tree of life bracelet will look like.

This is a similar representation of what the Tree of Life pendant for the 'Gracious Donation' will look like!
All orders will be recieved once the campaign finishes.
Shipping to Canada and the United States is included.

<br/><br/>My name is Hahna. I lived in Miller Scholarship Hall from 2008-2012

 of Kansas. Miller Hall is a unique living situation for women who are academically
gifted and have financial need. Forty-nine women live in the hall, do all their
own cooking and cleaning, and work co-operatively.<br/><br/><p>This scholarship would provide unlimited yoga classes for the academic year
at <a href=""http://omtreeshala.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">OmTree Shala,</a> located half a mile from the hall, as well as a yoga mat and
non-plastic water bottle for the recipient. OmTree Shala is a beautiful studio with instructors
who are knowledgeable, kind, and encouraging. The studio offers hot hatha, power vinyasa, yin, and yoga nidra classes at all levels. <br/></p>

I firmly believe that yoga is an invaluable gift
to anyone. The effect that yoga, particularly the classes I’ve taken at
OmTree Shala, has had on my life has been profound. I
started my practice after graduation in 2012, soon after OmTree opened, and I
immediately recognized the impact it would have had on my life as a student.
Unfortunately, yoga essentials and classes are expensive and even though OmTree
is a particularly affordable option, many college students still don’t have the
money to spend on it. The goal of this scholarship is to provide the opportunity and necessary tools for a personal yoga practice. This scholarship has the ability to improve quality of life and provide skills and strength (both physical and emotional) for the recipient. <br/><h3><br/></h3>

<h2>What do we need and what's in it for indiegogo community scientists?</h2>
<p>CBD Health Innovations needs US$78,000 to fund machines which are needed to start a testing lab for recreational and medical marijuana to service our home state of Washington. The machines are:</p>
<p>1. High Performance Liquid Chromatograph (HPLC)<br/>2. Gas Chromatograph<br/>3. Shipping, installation and calibration of above (pre-owned) machines.</p>
<p>These will be used to conduct the state-legislated testing which is expected to be finalized in WA by the end of this summer. We want to hit the ground running in September, so time is crucial, and we are seeking your donation as an investment in the future of medicine.</p>
<p>CBDHI’s first lab will conduct testing for independent legal dispensaries in accordance with Washington State laws and Federal policy statements, and we plan to invest the proceeds into funding our vision to <strong>achieve a world-changing health breakthrough with potential to impact the lives of millions.</strong></p>

For every dollar you invest, CBD Health Innovations will donate the same in product to a charity of your choice, just as soon as our pills, tinctures and edible products are ready to ship. We'll even suggest a charity for you.
We are committed to investing at least 10% of all CBDHI profits from testing marijuana in WA to funding free distribution programs worldwide for our non-cannabis based nutraceuticals.
 
The community scientists CBD Health Innovations is looking for, will believe passionately in the nutraceutical potential of medical marijuana, and support the need for a legal, certified, safe, non-psychoactive form to be supplied to those who need it.
Indiegogo contributors will perhaps know or live with a parent, partner, child, sibling or friend who is suffering from an illness they believe could be treated by the benefits of cannabinoids without the high.
Our Indiegogo community will want an ethical, experienced and numbers-savvy small business to beat the odds in the fight to find a real replacement for the toxic soup of drugs supplied to the market in this era of cancer, HIV/AIDS, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma, addiction, posttraumatic stress disorder, and the throng of other diseases proven to benefit from medical marijuana.
They will also understand the need for State-legislated testing of medical & recreational marijuana, and support CBDHI’s strategy to harness the revenue potential of testing in the state of Washington, which will quickly provide the final funding needed to turn the research into a legal, nutraceutical health solution which is not derived from cannabis.
 


 
What if it was your wife, brother or daughter who was suffering the hideous side effects of chemotherapy to treat breast cancer, prostate cancer or childhood leukaemia, constantly nauseous and unable to hold down more than water?
Would you fight for your loved one’s right to use a legal nutraceutical if you knew it could help ease their pain when life becomes intolerable, help them eat a little when they are weak from the chemicals, calm them down when fear of the future brings anxiety and sleeplessness?
Wouldn't you want to buy shares in the company that based its vision on developing a legal nutraceutical to treat your baby daughter, your teenage brother, your life partner or your aging grandmother?

The team at CBD Health Innovations believe that cannabinoids can and must be developed into a non-psychoactive, natural and herbal treatment available to every patient, and it is our passionate mission to find that legal nutraceutical within 12-18 months.

 


Other Ways We are Helping
CBD Health Innovations is already working in a consultative role with the Washington State Liquor Board to assist with their research into a suitable framework to support the recreational marijuana legislation passed in December 2012. Our scientists have advised the Board on research data, published papers and best practices for the past three months. We are in the blocks and ready to sprint!
CBD Heath Innovations intends to develop 7 labs in WA before the end of 2014, and we have invested every available dollar to get the project off the ground, so we need passionate and practical community scientists to believe in the possibilities and participate in our research.
Even if you can't contribute, please help us get the word out to like-minded Real People looking for Real Health Solutions! You can help by using the Indiegogo SHARE tools.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are a young SME, spin-off of an Italian, public research agency. In 2009 we started an activity in the biotech domain, by attempting to provide a fast track for research innovations to the market. Our market is that of biotech services (particularly in the omic area; genomics, metabolomics, transcrittomics etc.). We are mainly focusing the services for medical diagnostics and we do actively collaborate with research institutes and general Hospitals for carrying out specific R&amp;D activities in the direction of realizing new techniques for diagnostics, identification of possible drug targets, particularly in rare diseases and in oncology. The company is made by young  scientists, highly motivated, with robust scientific and technical backgrounds.</p>
<p><i><b>The proposed funding campaign deals with the realization of an important project for us: the set up of a new diagnostic system to discover a patient's proneness to develop prostate cancer and to provide a further measure to quantify its advancement. </b></i></p>
<p>Prostate Adenocarcinoma is one of the most widespread male tumors. To date, several tests are available (PSA test) allowing to establish, through a simple blood analysis, the presence of some generic pathological process occurring at the level of the prostate. The PSA test is, however, not tumor-specific (PSA could grow also for non-malignant conditions) and it is positive only after the (eventual) process outbreak. The new type of test we are thinking of is related to biochemical modification of a few genes (of the type called ""onco-suppressor""): when a cell starts to abnormally proliferating, these genes are able to kill the cell. When they do not work properly, such a ""suicide"" mechanisms does not work and humans, whose prostate cells have such onco-suppressors in their modified form, are exposed to cancer outbreak.</p>
<p>Our methods analyses 4 of these onco-suppressors, indicated by scientific works as being related to prostate cancer. The extent of their modification (in terms of number of cells whose DNA contains these genes in the ""modified"" form) can be related to the cancer progression or, even more importantly, to the proneness of the patient to be victim of a future cancer outbreak.</p>
<p><i><b>To establish a correct (and robust) link between level of modification of these genes and the development of prostate cancer, we must analyze a large number of patients (extracting DNA from prostate cells taken after biopsy)  with or without cancer, at the different cancer severity indices, in order to correlate and rationalize the extent of the genes modification and the severity of the condition.</b></i></p>
<p>To this end, we need to collect at least 100 patients tissues (contained in hospital's patients tissues databases) for extracting DNA and assessing our working hypothesis by measuring genes modifications by appropriate molecular biology protocol (which we have designed and realized).</p>
<p><b><i>Funds will be needed to perform this work with a large set of patients data</i></b>: larger the set, more accurate and reliable will be the test. The analysis will involve several steps requiring different expertise's, different tools and dedicated scientists:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>selection of set of patients with tissues contained in the tissue bank<br/>
</li>
<li>DNA extraction</li>
<li>purification and amplification</li>
<li>use of specific molecular probes to detect modified regions on the different onco-suppressors</li>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need the required amount ($ 20.000) as we have to screen such number of patients (and healthy males) of different ages, with different prostate diagnosis (from verified cancer, at different levels of severity, to other, non tumoral, conditions) in a way to correlate the different genes modifications with their conditions.

After that validation, the method and the related protocol, could be seriously tested in the clinical practice and then, in appropriate and useful, proposed to the market.</span></p>
<p><b>We will make use of any amount that we will get from the campaign in this direction</b>.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As said, prostate cancer is a very common decease affecting a large fraction of males, particularly those in the class of age &gt;50 years. A large fraction of males with altered prostate conditions are (fortunately) not affected by cancer; however, preliminary results show that, in some cases, to this non-tumoral condition is also associated the onco-suppressors modification. This makes more probable a future cancer outbreak in these patients. Our test could discover molecular modifications which could ""transform"" a negative biopsy (no cancer detected at the histological scale) into a ""nearly positive"" biopsy; the patient could be thus invited to make more frequent prostate controls due to its ascertained proneness to develop a tumor for the presence of modified onco-suppressor genes in his prostate cells. </p>
<p>This would help saving lives.</p>
<p>For declared tumor conditions, our molecular test could increase the accuracy of the histological diagnosis, by exploring onco-suppressor modifications in patient's tissue regions not yet invaded by tumor outbreak. Results of this analysis could strengthen (or weaken) the surgery option and/or motivating (and driving) towards a pharmacological option.</p>
<p>We do believe that this system could be effective; our preliminary results confirm that the chosen set of genes is strongly related to the tumoral conditions and, thus, differently from PSA-type analysis, can perceive the presence of tumor or, even more importantly, the proneness of the individual to be affected. </p>

<p>With 3 days to go, this quite obviously didnt work. But hey, its was worth trying. Dont worry to those who did contribute I will make sure to get your perks to you as soon as possible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Why does the Nurburgring need saving?</h3>
<p><br/>Last year the government run facility delcared bankruptcy and this year they have put up a for sale sign. Many people fear that if it falls into private hands that it will then be closed to the public. Together we can stop this!</p>
<p><br/>My name is Craig Anderson and I have been passionate about motorsports since I was a child barely able to reach the pedals on a go-kart.</p>
<p>I have been active racing and pit crewing in various grassroots and semi-pro races such such as Formula Mazda, the MX-5 Cup series, Spec Miata,<br/>Formula D, SCCA AutoCross and SCCA RallyCross races.</p>
<p>Who better to manage and run the most iconic motorsports park in the world than a true grassroots motorsports enthusiast?</p>
<h3><strong>What can we do?</strong></h3>
<p>In order to keep the Nurburgring open a private company with the right goals in mind needs to purchase it for a price of $161,000,000.00</p>
<p>The other $19,000,000 in this indiegogo will go to keeping the park open during the interim time while we put together a progressive and profitable business model that will keep the park open for years to come, as well as the fees associated with this method of crowdfunding.</p>
<p>We are only trying to buy the Nordschleife and associated property, not the Ring°park. We feel that these two entities need to be seperated and while they can encourage tourism and increase business for each other they should not be run together as one entity. We want to keep the motorsports park a motorsports park, not a theme park.</p>
<h3><strong>Whats in it for you?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>For every $25 contribution you will recieve a certificate with your name on it showing that you helped save the ring!</li>
<li>For every $100 contribution, you will recieve a certificate AND an exclusive shirt that proclaims loudly to the world that you helped save the nurburgring!</li>
<li>For every $1000 contribution we will engrave your name on a commemorative placque that we will be installing near the main entrance to the park when it comes under our ownership.</li>
<li>For every $10,000 contribution we will give you two all access passes to any motorsport event weekend of your choosing, once the track comes under our ownership.</li>
<li>Corporate Sponsorships and advertising are also available, please contact us privately.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the event that we do not reach our goal, the funds raised will go to help grassroots motorsports and will help encourage the next generation of motorsports enthusiasts.</p>
<h3>Global Impact</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Every year the Nurburgring attracts hundreds of events and thousands of fans. Professional races are televised globally, and to most motorsports fans the Nurburgring is the most well known and loved racetrack in the world.</p>

</div></div>","** UPDATE **
With 3 days to go, this quite obviously didnt work. But hey, its was worth trying. Dont worry to those who did contribute I will make sure to get your perks to you as soon as possible.
 
Thank you,

Why does the Nurburgring need saving?
Last year the government run facility delcared bankruptcy and this year they have put up a for sale sign. Many people fear that if it falls into private hands that it will then be closed to the public. Together we can stop this!
My name is Craig Anderson and I have been passionate about motorsports since I was a child barely able to reach the pedals on a go-kart.
I have been active racing and pit crewing in various grassroots and semi-pro races such such as Formula Mazda, the MX-5 Cup series, Spec Miata,Formula D, SCCA AutoCross and SCCA RallyCross races.
Who better to manage and run the most iconic motorsports park in the world than a true grassroots motorsports enthusiast?
What can we do?
In order to keep the Nurburgring open a private company with the right goals in mind needs to purchase it for a price of $161,000,000.00
The other $19,000,000 in this indiegogo will go to keeping the park open during the interim time while we put together a progressive and profitable business model that will keep the park open for years to come, as well as the fees associated with this method of crowdfunding.
We are only trying to buy the Nordschleife and associated property, not the Ring°park. We feel that these two entities need to be seperated and while they can encourage tourism and increase business for each other they should not be run together as one entity. We want to keep the motorsports park a motorsports park, not a theme park.
Whats in it for you?

For every $25 contribution you will recieve a certificate with your name on it showing that you helped save the ring!
For every $100 contribution, you will recieve a certificate AND an exclusive shirt that proclaims loudly to the world that you helped save the nurburgring!
For every $1000 contribution we will engrave your name on a commemorative placque that we will be installing near the main entrance to the park when it comes under our ownership.
For every $10,000 contribution we will give you two all access passes to any motorsport event weekend of your choosing, once the track comes under our ownership.
Corporate Sponsorships and advertising are also available, please contact us privately.

In the event that we do not reach our goal, the funds raised will go to help grassroots motorsports and will help encourage the next generation of motorsports enthusiasts.
Global Impact


Every year the Nurburgring attracts hundreds of events and thousands of fans. Professional races are televised globally, and to most motorsports fans the Nurburgring is the most well known and loved racetrack in the world.

<h3><strong>UPDATE </strong></h3>
<h3>Thank you all so much for your support! Hannah is currently in Children's Hospital receiving her 2nd round of chemo. She is responding extremely well to chemo and according to the most recent ultrasound her tumor has been all but eliminated. She still will receive her 52 weeks of chemo, but her prognosis is looking good.</h3>

<p>Thank you everyone for your support and a special thank you to Children's Hospital!</p>
<h3>Hannah's Story</h3>
<p>After losing both their home and livelihood in one horrific fire one year ago, life was finally beginning to get back to normal for Hannah and her family. That was until Hannah started getting sick. Dozens of doctors visits and just as many misdiagnosis left the family feeling confused and frustrated, but it wasnt until Hannah's stomach began to grow that they got really concerned. After a handful of doctors visits and diagnosis' like bad posture and constipation the frustration was starting to set in, but it wasn't until Hannah started having trouble breathing and was airlifted to Vancouver Childrens Hopsital that the real nightmare began. </p>
<p>First a tumor in her stomach and a biopsy which showed that it wasn't a tumor, but inflammation left Hannah in critical condition for several days. Than the possibility that she may have lymphoma, then leukemia and finally, after almost a week of tests there was a diagnosis. </p>
<p>Stage 4, Rhabdomyosarcoma. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What your contribution provides</h3>
<p>Because Hannah's family is from Vancouver Island and she is being treated in Vancouver Childrens Hospital there are a great deal of transportation expenses. </p>
<p>Helping the family with these donations will allow both of Hannah's parents to remain on the mainland with her while she undergoes treatement. By keeping both parents close, not only are the trials of chemotherapy easier on Hannah, but it makes it possible for one parent to leave at a time to care for their baby daughter Hailey who is under the care of Hannah's grandmother.</p>
<p>Your dontations will also afford the family the ability to take Hannah to the zoo, the aquarium and any other venues that get her away from the hopsital when her condition improves.</p>
</div>

<p>By helping support this family you are helping them to eliminate the worries of financial obligations and you are allowing them to focus solely on being there for their daughter as she battles this horrific disease. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Joann Gonzalez has been a dear friend of mine for the past 18 years.  I have seen her go through many ups and downs, but never anything as serious as this.  She is in her late 30s and several months ago found out she has stage 4 colon cancer.</p>
<ul>
<li>I am Elizabeth Rivera a friend who wants to help someone who has impacted my life so much.</li>
<li>This campaign is to help Joann pay for the medical treatments that will help her beat cancer.</li>
<li>By donating any amount you will help me raise money so Joann can focus on getting better and not worrying about paying her bills after her job let her go.</li>
</ul>
<p>The friends and family of Joann Gonzalez appreciate any help you may provide.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Any money donated will help Joann pay for medical expenses and other bills:</p>
<ul>
<li>The amount raised through this site will be given to Joann to reduce the stress she is facing trying to make ends meet while battleing cancer.</li>
<li>Your perk is knowing you helped a wonderful person in need.</li>
<li>Regardless of the amount raised it will all go to Joann.  Every bit counts and anything will help.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This idea came to me after reading about the lady bullied on the bus and I thought this would be a wonderful idea to get help for my dear friend.  When I visit her I know she is worried about how she is going to pay for everything and that is not helping her recover.  After losing her job things have become much tighter and having to pay for COBRA plus other expenses is taking a toll on her.  She had a large tumor removed from her colon in April of this year and has been in and out of the hospital ever since with stage 4 cancer.  When I told her what I was thinking of doing she started to cry and told me how lucky she felt to have such great friends.</p>
<ul>
<li>This project will help Joann continue to fight her battle with cancer.</li>
<li>Everyone needs a helping hand once in a while and I hope everyone who reads this will help a friend fight cancer.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute please spread the word about helping my dear friend Joann:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about helping Joann battle stage 4 colon cancer.</li>
<li>Use indiegogo share tools, facebook, email, twitter, text, or even shout it from the roof tops, but please get the word out about this fundraiser.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>We all thank you in advance for any help provided.</p></div>","Short Summary

By donating any amount you will help me raise money so Joann can focus on getting better and not worrying about paying her bills after her job let her go.

The friends and family of Joann Gonzalez appreciate any help you may provide.


What We Need & What You Get
Any money donated will help Joann pay for medical expenses and other bills:

The amount raised through this site will be given to Joann to reduce the stress she is facing trying to make ends meet while battleing cancer.
Your perk is knowing you helped a wonderful person in need.
Regardless of the amount raised it will all go to Joann.  Every bit counts and anything will help.



The Impact
This idea came to me after reading about the lady bullied on the bus and I thought this would be a wonderful idea to get help for my dear friend.  When I visit her I know she is worried about how she is going to pay for everything and that is not helping her recover.  After losing her job things have become much tighter and having to pay for COBRA plus other expenses is taking a toll on her.  She had a large tumor removed from her colon in April of this year and has been in and out of the hospital ever since with stage 4 cancer.  When I told her what I was thinking of doing she started to cry and told me how lucky she felt to have such great friends.

This project will help Joann continue to fight her battle with cancer.
Everyone needs a helping hand once in a while and I hope everyone who reads this will help a friend fight cancer.



Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute please spread the word about helping my dear friend Joann:

Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about helping Joann battle stage 4 colon cancer.
Use indiegogo share tools, facebook, email, twitter, text, or even shout it from the roof tops, but please get the word out about this fundraiser.


We all thank you in advance for any help provided.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>What's Going On Here?</h3>
<p>Hello everyone, my name is Jonathan Wolf. I am a twenty-eight year old former US Navy Master at Arms, and disabled with multiple spinal injuries. Unfortunately, due to regulations that I can't figure out, I cannot get disability, or proper medical care here in the US. I have even had a law firm helping me attempt to get disability here. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What Do I Need?</h3>
<p>I have some amazing friends in Australia whom can help me get the medical care I need, which includes the possibility of multiple spinal surgeries.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is going to take a deccent amount of money to get my passport and visa, as well as my plane ticket.</p>
<p>I have nothing left at this point, having sold off anything and everything I own of value to pay bills where I live. I don't even have a bed anymore, or a proper pair of shoes, since I am trying to put everything I have into this move.</p>
<p>I will say that a portion of the funds I am trying to raise will go to clothing and other personal neccesities, but the gross majority will be paying for my travel expenses and getting situated in Australia.</p>
<h3>What Exactly Is Wrong?</h3>
<p>I have:</p>
<p>Multiple degenerating discs</p>
<p>Lateral herniation T12/L1</p>
<p>Anterior bulge L5/S1 with the disc impacting the thecal sac.</p>
<p>Multiple schmorl's nodes T5-T12</p>
<p>Facet Joint Arthrpathy throughout my spine</p>
<p>Those are all from my MRI done last year. Now I cannot sleep in any position without my arms and/or legs going numb. I am unable to walk any significant distance, and normally have to have a cane to get around. I cannot pick up anything heavier than a twelve pack without extreme pain.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my case is 'not of significant concern' to the doctors that are supposed to help me, and fix what is wrong with me. I have talked to other doctors, and they have expressed major concern for my case, but here in the USA, I cannot get treatment without really good insurance.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What Am I Expecting From This Campaign?</h3>
<p>Even if I don't raise enough to fund the whole move, if I can get enough to check one item off of my list, I am that much closer to my goal.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can donate anything, even a dollar, that is fantastic.</p>
<p>Spreading the word about my campaign is also a great way to help.</p>
<p>If you know off any veterans assistance groups that could help with the fundraising, please let them know. (I can gladly provide my DD-214 to prove veteran status)</p>
<p>Every little bit helps me get closer to a possibly pain free life.</p>
<p>If anyone is able to provide things I can use as perks, that would also be AMAZING, since I have nothing on hand to offer</p>

I will be undergoing a double mastectomy with nipple reconstruction to help me obtain a more masculine figure, hopefully this June. I've been receiving testosterone injections for a little over a year, and the further along I get, the more uncomfortable I become with my breasts. At this time, I wear what is called a ""binder"" to help compress my chest. I wear this for 12-15 hours per day, anytime I'm out of the house. It compresses my breasts down to the point that they are barely noticeable, but at the cost of my comfort. At times it becomes constrictive and hard to breathe. It makes the simplest tasks, such as bending over to pick something up or going from sitting to standing difficult, because it constantly needs to be readjusted. It's unnerving to walk into the men's restroom and wonder if anyone ""knows"". I haven't had any issues as of yet, but it is a legitimate safety concern of mine. Binding is also known to cause issues with the lungs, and sometimes even fractured ribs. Most importantly is the fact that having breasts as a male is not ""normal"", according to society. This causes severe body dysphoria, or a severe discomfort and disconnect with one's body. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>At this point in my transition, I'm finally becoming the ""me"" that I've always felt I was inside. As each months passes, I'm able to look back and be proud of the changes I've made, both physically and within myself. I've become a better person. I've even considered going back to school, because I've FINALLY decided on something I'd like to do for a living. That's a big step for me, as I've had a very difficult time making a solid decision on my career path. I'm truly becoming one with myself and finally figuring out what I want and need out of life. This surgery is the only thing that holds me back from being my whole, true self. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I've been working 60 hours per week, between my 3 jobs, for the last few months trying to save up enough money for this surgery. I'm tired, but I'm keeping in good spirits. This surgery will be life-changing, so I've used it as my motivation. Unfortunately I'm having a very difficult time saving the money. It's not that I don't put the work in, I just think I'm overwhelmed with the thought of saving such a large amount of money in such a short amount of time. I get discouraged and I give up. I'm asking for help with this one, because I can't do it on my own. I'm not a beggar, and I certainly understand that there are more pressing issues out there that could use not only your attention, but mine as well. That's why I will continue to donate to other causes whenever I can, and I would completely understand if you would feel your dollars are more suited to someone else. Please just remember that ANY amount helps and is most definitely appreciated. Also, please note that there are options to donate anonymously, if you choose not to share your identity. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Any money I raise over my ""goal"" will be passed on to another transgendered individual in my area, to assist in their surgery costs. There are more people out there just like me than a lot of people realize, and unfortunately they will encounter the same issues as I have. Insurance companies do not typically cover ANY transgender related health issues. Mine doesn't cover hormones, surgeries, even ""trans-related"" doctor visits, which means I pay the full amount for all of it. It gets very expensive and has proven to be quite discouraging. Furthermore, if I raise double my goal amount, I will donate 25% of the proceeds to Transgender Youth programs in the Minneapolis area. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I sincerely appreciate you taking the time to read this and I hope that you have learned a few things about who I am and why I'm doing this. I can't speak enough of the overwhelming support I've received from my friends, family and aquaintances in regards to this transition.

<p>Nicholas became interested in racing back in February of 2001 when he was down in Florida. Right away his favorite driver became Dale Earnhardt Jr. Nicholas wanted to become more involved with racing to the point where he decided that he didn't want to play football or t-ball but wanted to race go-karts. He started out in karts from 2003 to 2009. In that time he had become one of the best junior karters out of the Northeast and wanted to move on into bigger and better things. One of the very fortunate opportunities that Nicholas has had back in 2009 was being able to have breakfast with Joey Logano talking about racing along with each other’s goals and how to achieve them. Nicholas started out in 2010 racing a Bandolero Car at Waterford Speedbowl. After the 2010 season Nicholas ended up accomplishing more than he had expected, especially winning the Bandolero National Qualifier. In 2011 Nicholas had won again the Bandolero National Qualifier and started racing a Legend Car. For 2012 Nicholas had competed in 32 Legend Car races and had 22 young lion division top 5’s and 5 young lion division wins. At the end of the year Nicholas had finished 4<sup>th</sup> in points at the Waterford Speedbowl for Wednesday Nights along with getting the Sportsmanship Award for the Legend Car division.</p>
<p>Besides just racing Nicholas is involved in a whole lot more. Back in middle school he was president of the student council and on the schools basketball team. While in middle school he started up his own charity. At Christmas time he would go around school collecting money to buy gifts for the children at the Connecticut Children's Medical Center.  While in middle school Nicholas was able to achieve High Honors every semester along with being busy with racing and community service. Along with those charitable things Nicholas is also in the church choir and an alter server. This year Nicholas is in his junior year of high school at Xavier High School where he is doing Cross Country, Indoor, and Outdoor Track. He still continuously achieves Honors for his grades.</p>
<p><strong>Why I’m doing this</strong></p>
<p>I’m trying to raise money for Lung Cancer Alliance and to spread awareness of lung cancer through my racing. November is lung cancer awareness month. I came into partnership with Lung Cancer Alliance when a fellow competitor approached my mom about donating money to lung cancer. I was not affiliated with any lung cancer organization at that time. My mom, a lung cancer survivor, contacted Lung Cancer Alliance about going into partnership with their organization. Lung Cancer Alliance agreed and our partnership was formed. With your generous donation I will be able to give half of the money raised to Lung Cancer Alliance and the other half will be used for my racing. With the money raised I will be able to travel the United States to spread lung cancer awareness. If you do not feel comfortable donating directly to me, please feel free to donate to <a href=""http://www.lungcanceralliance.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.lungcanceralliance.org</a>.

I seemed to fit in pretty quickly. The first couple days I just rolled with everything that I was seeing, learning tons, and trying to help and teach as much as I could. Tuesday was the day that changed everything for me. We switch shift at 7:00 am and I got report from another EMT. One of the patients was a young woman who had been assaulted. She was injured so badly that she required surgery and was waiting for the OR to be open. This young woman was lying on a black plastic mattress, unable to make eye contact with anyone, crying. It was difficult not to notice her tears rolling down the mattress. There were other patients and emergencies through the day. In the early afternoon a young mother brought her 9 month old in. The baby had fallen and hit her head many days before. The baby was lethargic and no longer eating normally. This was the first baby I had drawn blood on, really the first baby I have seen in an emergent situation, the hospital I work in does not see children. The baby had a head CT and it confirmed that there was a head bleed and there was nothing that could be done but to watch her and hope for the best. Just before the end of my shift she passed away. It was, by far, the hardest day in my professional career. By the end of the day I was standing in the courtyard of the hospital, crying and wondering why I hadn't paid $75.00 to bring an additional bag. And for that matter $150.00 two more bags! I really couldn't change what had happened, but I could change other things. On my second trip I brought 20+ sheets(the hospital has none, and the pt's only get one if we give it to them or their family brings it) and all the supplies I could. All of my trips since, I have had 3 bags and I try to get everyone on the trip to carry 3 as well.<br/></p><p><br/></p></div>","This will be my 5th trip to Port-au-Prince, Haiti.  I'll be traveling November 8th thur the 15th.  I am an EMT and I work at Abbott Northwestern Hospital in Minneapolis, MN.  I will be going for 8 days to work at Hospital Bernard Mevs, the only critical care hospital in Haiti.  The organization that I volunteer with is Project Medishare for Haiti.  Project Medishare has been in Haiti, helping since 1994.  Project Medishare also mobilized the first medical team on the ground in Haiti just 12 hours after the devastating 2010 earthquake.  I'm proud to volunteer with an organization that is so connected to Haiti and are truly rooted in helping the country help themselves.  As a volunteer, we pay $700.00 to cover the expenses of flight from Miami, food that is made for us, and the rest to help them continue to run the hospital and several clinics in rural areas.  I will also need to cover the cost of my flights to and from Miami and a night in a hotel in Miami.Any funding over my goal will be used for buying medical supplies and pay the airline for extra fees for checked bags.  I bring a total of 3 bags-$75.00 for the second and third bag-on each flight, one to Miami and from Miami to Haiti.I learned on the first trip that up front $75.00 each for 2 extra bags seems like a lot of money.  After you are in Haiti and see how much they have and how much they need that concern is trivial.My first trip was three years ago.  I packed and repacked so that I had I carry on bag and 1 checked bag, to keep expenses down. We started right away on Saturday when we got there in the early afternoon. I seemed to fit in pretty quickly. The first couple days I just rolled with everything that I was seeing, learning tons, and trying to help and teach as much as I could. Tuesday was the day that changed everything for me. We switch shift at 7:00 am and I got report from another EMT. One of the patients was a young woman who had been assaulted. She was injured so badly that she required surgery and was waiting for the OR to be open. This young woman was lying on a black plastic mattress, unable to make eye contact with anyone, crying. It was difficult not to notice her tears rolling down the mattress. There were other patients and emergencies through the day. In the early afternoon a young mother brought her 9 month old in. The baby had fallen and hit her head many days before. The baby was lethargic and no longer eating normally. This was the first baby I had drawn blood on, really the first baby I have seen in an emergent situation, the hospital I work in does not see children.

 The ""Kicker""









Aquawing was initially design for pool swimming and water recreation (above). The Aquawing 'open-water' concept (below) is optional add-on.   We have  indications that it could also be suitable for water sport activity such as sea-swimming, bodyboard alternative for wave surfing,  and lifeguards equipment,  but yet to be proven.




Key Features



Swim faster! glide on water with super
efficient hydrodynamic design


Replaces most types of kickboards and
pull-buoys whether held by hand, knees or feet


Connectible units make possible to adjust
buoyancy for different weights


An ergonomic and organic design that
feels natural and is easier to hold.


Kids delight with infinite playful water
float configurations (incl. full body support!)

Advantage


Competitive advantages over conventional
kickboards:


Superior Streamline Swimming


Adjust amount
of workout by connecting more or less Aquawings modules.


Comfortable and fun grab.  Aquawing can
be held by one hand. Can alternate hands or even
use two aquawings, one in each hand.
The easy-grab makes it suitable for open-water, sea-swimming, not only pools


Does more! Swimmer can even
flip-turn with Aquawing (similar to supersonic ""tuck""
in flying wings, aquawing fluid-dynamics design may help push-up
or roll in flip-turns)



Technology


Our patented device uses advanced fluid-dymanics technology to
improve the motion of hand-held bodies under, through and over water, including
(but not limited to) controlling buoyancy flexibility using modularity and
connectibility of these bodies.
  Risks & Challenges  We have a great start with working prototype, patent protection and initial traction, but we know that getting a product to market is a long road. As we learn from comparable consumer products, the number of iterations to perfect the device's snap-fit using the right combination of materials and water-proofing could vary from 3 to as much as 15.     As a founder I am a ""swiss-army-knife"" and stops at nothing in reaching our goal. My record speaks for itself as an effective leader.
 To overcome these challenges I have developed a clear roadmap: 

We will continue to work lean and clean in product development. 

We will work diligently to secure sales channels. 

We will make every effort to work with the right strategic partners. 
    Other Ways You Can Help We know that not everyone can contribute with cash, but that doesn't mean you can't help:  Please get the word out and make some noise about our campaign.

Use it daily for only 15 minutes to completely unwind and reach a deep state of relaxation.GoRelax helps relax the nervous system by replicating the feeling of getting a massage. A massage everyday can become your reality with GoRelax.  GoRelax works on the principle of Acupressure. Acupressure is one of the oldest natural therapies used for relief against stress, back pain, neck pain & insomnia. However, society at large hasn’t had access to it until now. With GoRelax, we are working to put Acupressure in a form that is accessible to everyone.     You can simply unzip it and use it anywhere you want. This makes the mat versatile and easy to carry. Use any section you want as per your need.       You can easily fold GoRelax to 1/3rd of its size which makes it easy to carry on the go. It also occupies less space and is very convenient to store.  Crafted with 100% Eco-friendly material that is good for you and the environment. The outer fabric is made of 100% cotton fabric filled with natural coconut fiber.     GoRelax is labelled with foot and hand reflexology charts. It showcases how different organs are being stimulated by applying pressure on different parts of the body.   It is designed scientifically and contours perfectly to your body. GoRelax is unique specially because of the curvature around the neck. You don't have to buy a separate pillow for your neck pain.   All branches of medical science agree that human body possesses immense natural strength to cure itself from any health problem. By utilizing our body’s natural energy system, GoRelax stimulates pressure points within our body which increases blood circulation and helps reduce muscle tension and aids in the body’s natural healing process. When you lay on GoRelax, the muscle tension on your back yields to the pressure generated by the lotus simulators. It enables muscle fibers to elongate and relax, blood to flow freely, and endorphins (natural pain relieving hormones) to be released.    With high endorphin levels, we feel less pain and fewer negative effects of stress.  There are several studies and clinical trials conducted that prove that 2 weeks of daily use of Acupressure Mats for 15-20 minutes helps relieve pain and reduce stress.   GoRelax is for everyone - office workers, new moms, sports people, insomnia sufferers, weight watchers, healthy living advocates. Just take out 15 minutes from your daily routine and make GoRelax your wellness habit.  Hey Kickstarter, we are Aditi and Akshay, the founders of GoRelax.

It not only helped ease pain but Aditi felt a lot more relaxed and energetic during the day.This incident is what triggered the idea of GoRelax. If there was knowledge transmitted over generations that worked, why not validate with research, and create something usable by others? With a lot of research and validation from various medical and renown acupressure bodies, we came up with a product design, created experiments, and perfected our product over the next year. After countless hours of toil, we’re immensely proud to bring our product to market and hope to see millions benefit from this ancient wisdom, solving for some of the most chronic stress and posture induced problems.We hope our story resonates and gives others like us a simple respite to this chronic problem. Join us in our quest to GoRelax!  - Aditi and Akshay    Lead Marketing Partner:This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with700+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $300MM raised between them.  Other Partners:   Customs & duties informationGoRelax cannot mark orders as gifts.

 Think about the things healthy lungs can do for you. Rooting for your favorite team, singing to your jam, yelling at someone who drives you crazy, holding your breath, climbing up the stairs, dancing…With so many factors threatening your lungs, you need to consciously care for your lungs to be able to do these for the rest of your lifetime.  

 
  
 BULO is used to measure your breathing activity. It connects to the Bulo app and gives you data that you can use to train harder and adopt healthier lifestyle habits!  
 The Bulo app comes with a library of performance breathing exercise videos that also has a library of performance breathing exercises that will always be available to make sure that you can perform better at whatever task you're aiming to accomplish! 

 
 


 

  BULO stores the measurements and displays them weekly, monthly and yearly. Use this data and tailor it to your own regiments. 

 


 
BULO measures airflow at intervals of 10ms. It can precisely measure the amount of air that is being exhaled.  This data is then transferred to your smartphone via Bluetooth and is then calculated through our own algorithm to display the final figures.       About BuloBreathing is one of the most crucial daily activities that we engage in.

If you've been struggling to fall asleep or feeling stressed lately, then this blanket is for you. The moment you put on our blanket, you'll feel grounded. The heavy weight creates a natural calming effect that will help you relax — called a deep pressure stimulation that relaxes your nervous system. It ends up changing your nervous system from ""fight or flight"" mode to ""rest and digest"" mode. It has the same effect as a newborn baby being swaddled, which stops them from crying and being startled. As a result, it helps improve pain, sleep, anxiety and mood by increasing your happiness hormones.11 million Canadians are experiencing high levels of stress as people continue to stay home and isolate during the pandemic, so it’s no surprise it’s taking a toll on mental health. That’s 1 in 3 Canadians. And over 70 percent of Canadians have experienced one traumatic event, so it’s not a surprise that 1 out of 10 Canadians may develop PTSD at some point in their lifetime. Weighted blankets have a lot to offer, there are numerous benefits to someone’s health and they've become one of the top health trends in the last few years. But they’re not just a trend, they're an important medical device that’s been around since the 1990s.

Friends Breathe Oil Fumes on Aircraft: Contribute to Crew and Passenger Health Research Project  (GIVE TEN, GET TEN...)</b></p>
<p>We are re-launching our campaign on this important subject, having raised more than $3000 which has already been forwarded to the research team. We are again calling everyone who
flies to join our campaign to make air travel healthier. Please GIVE
$10 (or something comparable, any currency) to a talented university research team to finish developing an important blood
test for airline crews and passengers (more information below). Also, GET 10 more people (Facebook friends, any friends, anybody with a pulse...) to do the same.</p>
<p>Ever smelled dirty
socks during an airline flight? A dirty socks smell coming from the aircraft
air supply vents is likely to be engine oil fumes in the ventilation air. You
read that right: the air that comes through the cabin and flight deck vents is
first compressed in the engines, and it isn’t filtered before you breathe it.
Many crew unions around the world receive regular reports from members who
report dirty socks or musty fumes in the cabin supply air, followed by problems
with memory, balance, and speech, for example. Nobody thinks it will happen to
them, until it does.</p>
<p>Every day, just in the
US alone, there is an official report of toxic oil fumes contaminating the air
you breathe on regular commercial flights.  Let alone the many more
reports documented around the globe. Aviation engine oils contain neurotoxic
additives, so breathing the fumes can cause lasting damage to your brain. Also,
flight safety can be compromised when crews are impaired inflight. You will
meet some affected crew members in our video.  </p>
<p>As things stand, few
people  can  access the aircraft maintenance records to PROVE that
oil contaminated the cabin air. And there is no blood test specific to these
fumes, so airlines often say that “nothing was wrong” and that crews and
passengers are just imagining their disabling symptoms. Fortunately, a
dedicated research team at the University of Washington is developing a blood
test specific to the aviation engine oil. You can help by donating to this
campaign. </p>
<p>If you breathed oil
fumes on YOUR flight today, how would you prove it? If you’re a crewmember,
would the airline doctor listen and support you, or pressure to you to return
to work sick? Would your doctor tell you that you’re over 50 now, so maybe that
explains your memory problems? Can you afford to not work and not get paid for
a while? These are the stories that previously-healthy crewmembers share, and
passengers breathe the same air...</p>
<p>Everyone
who flies needs this blood test, so we all need to GIVE 10 of any currency and
GET 10 friends to do the same. If you are exposed to oil fumes onboard,
then you need to be able to prove it, and all of us need the industry to feel
more motivated to clean up the cabin air.</p>
<p>A single person’s TEN
DOLLARS won’t fund anything, but our GOAL is to bring ENOUGH people onboard
that ENOUGH ten dollar donations are received, that the research will be a
success, for the good of crews everywhere. So please, <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/toxic-oil-fumes-onboard-give-ten-get-ten#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">GIVE TEN, GET TEN</a>, and encourage your flying
partners, family, friends, people you don’t even like, your dog, your barista,
the guy who fixes your car, anyone and everyone, to do the same. </p>

You can make an anonymous donation, or you can put your name to it - either way
works.</p>
<p>Join us. Change the
way the industry handles the air you breathe on regular commercial flights.
Donate now! Currently, 95% of your donation goes directly to the researchers,
and 5% to Indiegogo, per their rules. We have been approved as a non-profit organization, such that contributions (made in the US, at least) will be
tax-deductible. EVERY dollar, euro, pound, peso and yen, every bit – however

<p>On September 25, 2012, David Faeller was diagnosed with Esophagus Cancer and it changed his life forever</p>
<p> </p>
<p>David Faeller, a Bellevue resident, was diagnosed with esophagus cancer on 9/25/12. We are asking for your love, support and help for David and his family at this time. Dave has always been a very caring and loving person to his family and friends. He is the loving father of three young girls, an uncle, a brother, a caring son and many other roles to people in his life. This incident happened a month before his 49th birthday.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>March 9<sup>th</sup>. Dave had emergency surgery; during surgery he had a minor heart attack. This fund will be given to the family to help pay for medical expenses, family travel, lost work and incidental expenses to help the family through this difficult time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now David needs your friendship and support so he can get through this difficult time and be there for everyone that needs him, especially his 3 young girls. His family needs our help too, so they can afford to take care of him and get him to doctor appointments, chemo appointments and Rehab in order for Dave to stay at home. He still has hope, but his life has changed forever.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>ANYTHING you can donate WILL help!  If you have spoken to him since he was diagnosed with Esophagus Cancer with , you know that he is staying positive and is thankful to be alive. In order for David to stay at home, and recover. David will need his rest and not worry about the medical bills or all of the rest of the bills such as rent. He would be more comfortable being able to recover at home with his family and friends around. We hope to at least help them fund this effort. Before this happened, David could not afford health insurance with his job as a truck driver. His medical costs are undetermined right now, but he already has several costly bills and many future expenses. No matter what amount you can donate it will greatly help him and his family with the related costs from his cancer</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If we do not reach the goal, the funds will still go to the same place and help his family with medical bills and associated costs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your donation will not only help Dave and his family with the costs they are incurring from this horrible situation, but it will ultimately show your love and support for his recovery. He needs this positive impact right now.  Becoming temporally disabled right now at the age of 49 and not being able to work right now to provide for his family is a lot to swallow, but not the end! You can also help Dave turn his life into something positive for other people facing similar issues.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you cannot give a monetary donation, there are many ways you can help and show support.</p>

<p>My mother, an OBGYN/LABOR/DELIVERY NURSE, was ending her 12 hour shift at her local hospital on August 10, 2013.  When suddenly she collapsed. She was immediately airlifted to a specialist hospital. Keep in mind she has never smoked, drank, or used any illicit drugs. She was diagnosed with  MRSA, with clots in both lungs, among a few other things. Taking Coumadin along with many other medications for clot reduction. She is having issues regulating her INR with medications. She is only one clot away from a heart attack, a dead lung, or even death.</p>
<p>My mother has been a registered nurse, working in the labor/delivery department for as long as I can remember (over 20 years). She has brought so many lives into the world, and been the one to console those, who at a time of joy had to endure sadness! Once she was released to go home, to relax and recooperate, she found her house in total disarray. To add to the turmoil of this life threatening incident, her now husband (soon to be ex) became extremely abusive, and in her weakened state was forced to leave her home. Temporarily staying with my brother, her son.</p>
<p>Now this is not the end. Due to ""red-tape"" and timing issues, she has no immediate income to support her. She will eventually start getting a temporary payment from her employer but there is no set date that will kick in. So, at this very moment she is struggling with day to day necessities.......even purchasing food. This breaks my heart!</p>
<p>As a single mother of five, living on a modest $1200 per month I can only contribute so much!</p>
<p>I am asking all of my friends, family, friends of family, anyone to help contribute. Even the smallest amounts help!</p>
<p>Please keep in mind my mother is a very proudfull person and her stubborness will not allow her to ask for help on her own. I literally had to pry the information I got from her to get the truth about her situation. Knowing she would never openly admit it.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Our tracking system has already come a long way before becoming an Indiegogo project. We developed the tracker for a pilot project at a company that was specifically looking for simplicity (both hardware and software wise), ease of use and low cost while also being able to be manufactured in non-optimal conditions: even soldered and assembled by hand with minimal training or older equipment. These goals were met within the pilot project; prototypes were produced on a small scale and the project was an overall success.</p>
<h3><img alt=""Tracker Diagram"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://193.239.210.15/~johan/indiegogo/tracker_diagram.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Tracker Operation""/></h3>
<p>After the pilot project, we intend to commercialize the tracker on a larger scale, with a roadmap leading to more advanced trackers. We first tried to do this through a Kickstarter campaign, but we believe our funding goals were set too high, even though there were good reasons for the amount of money we asked for. We went back to the campaign drawing board and took input from our Kickstarter backers and critics - and here we are.</p>
<p>We had to make a few concessions on the software timeline, scaled back the roadmap and developed more aspects of the project on our own without relying on crowd funding. This is the reason we were able to scale back the funding from 80.000£ to the current 20.000£. There have been no concessions on hardware, quality, and our aim to manufacture in Europe and the States.</p>
<p>So what do we need the remaining funding for? Besides finalization, some minor tweaks and an initial production run set-up: the plastics. Building custom plastic enclosures is expensive due to the moulds required. The design is kept simple to keep the costs of the molds low, but will still run in the thousands of Euros.</p>
<p>One more important thing to know: for every pledge equal to or greater than 89£ we donate a tracker to the non-profit <a href=""http://www.thetechfoundation.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Foundation"">Technology for Change Foundation</a> - in particular <a href=""http://www.thetechfoundation.org/?page_id=7970"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Technology for Change Foundation"">this project.</a> Should you desire to financially contribute to this project, just add the amount you wish to donate to your pledge and let us know.</p>

<h2>What can I track?</h2>
<p>Basically anything you want! Some use case examples:</p>
<p>- Track your children coming from and going to school.</p>
<p>- Track your loved ones when they go on a trip. It gives you the ability to feel much closer to them even when they are away. Plus, you can guide them to local sights to see even when you're 1000 Miles away.</p>
<p>- Add the tracker to your dog's collar just in case.</p>
<p>- Use as a GPS data logger for geocaching or mapping, or to replay that hiking trip or bike ride you took.</p>

<p>- In POWER OFF mode, using e.g., a motion sensor to activate the device, power consumption  is 10uA for the main system and 140uA for the sensor (both worst case, plus some leakage). This translates into a battery life between 1 to 2 years.</p>
<p>- Overall battery lifetime during active tracking is dependent on amount of tracking updates sent.</p>
<p>- Tracker has expansion port for sensors, data loggers, etc. and combinations. We currently have motion  sensor and microSD card logging. In the future we will add other sensors.</p>

<h3>Tracking Features</h3>
<p>- Request update at any time<br/>- Software control for tracking interval (10min, 30min, 1hour)<br/>- Tracking mode: instead of timely intervals, send updates based on target speed and heading changes</p>
<p>- logging of data to SD card automatically when present, and 'frequent logging' mode can be set through the software to log location to SD card in 15 second intervals (for hiking applications, etc).</p>
<p>- Mapping software supports Google maps and OpenStreetMap by default. Google StreetView is also integrated.</p>
<p>- Each tracking point contains location, speed, heading, time/date. These can be accessed through markers on the map. The software also supports showing tracks, geo-fencing and GPX export. SD card tracking logs can be imported and visualised.</p>
<p>- Multiple trackers can easily be managed through the software under different categories. All remote configuration of the trackers (e.g. pairing with the software) is done within the software.</p>
<p>- Supports both metric and imperial units</p>
<p>- Reporting in graph form showing speed and distance travelled</p>
<p>- Software is fully cross platform (Windows, Linux, MacOS and FreeBSD). Android application is under development. You can combine the PC software with Android for example to set which device is tracking which asset.</p>
<p>- Independent of third party service provider. Works with prepaid as well as contract SIM cards. This gives you maximum flexibility; if you don't track, you don't pay. No set-up fees, etc. and your sensitive data does not reside on a third party server somewhere.</p>
<p>- You can use Clickatell (<a href=""http://www.clickatell.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.clickatell.com/</a>) for the software to send SMS's to the tracker, or use the USB modem provided. This gives you flexibility to use whatever works out cheapest for your tracking station. When using Clickatell, the modem only needs to receive data from the tracker and thus won't need any credit.</p>

<p>There are plenty of other trackers out there, so what makes this one special? We see that most trackers today fall in two categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>uses hardware which is sold at a loss with a monthly contract to access the tracking data</li>
<li>sends tracking information to a cell phone using SMS where the user can see the coordinates and open a link in Google Maps</li>
</ol>
<p>Both have some serious disadvantages. The first one has a monthly cost attached even if you're not using the tracker. You could deactivate the subscription for a certain amount of time, but usually there is a reactivation fee when you want to use your tracker again. Furthermore, all the tracking data sits on a third party server. If there is a security breach or if the provider goes out of business your data could very well be compromised or lost.</p>
<p>The second one has a problem of usability. What if you want to track 3 or 4 or a lot more vehicles? How do you efficiently manage this data? Sending text messages to the tracker is prone to errors and can be very tedious. Getting the data back and clicking on a link to get you to a Google map might work for one tracking point, but what if you are tracking a vehicle over time and need to see a history?</p>
<p>The advantage of the second one however is that it uses SMS for the communication of tracking data from or commands to the tracker. Why SMS is a good idea over other technologies such as GPRS, EDGE or 3G/4G?</p>
<ul>
<li>Coverage: works even with connections that are not good enough for voice, and is available where other network services are not</li>
<li>The network itself acts as a buffer in case one of the communicating ends has no connection</li>
<li>The amount of power needed to send an SMS is much less than to e.g., set up a TCP connection over GPRS</li>
<li>Point to Point communication without the need for a server with static IP address</li>
</ul>
<p>These criteria make that SMS is a very good method. Our software eliminates the disadvantages mentioned before. The application handles all the data coming from the tracker (or trackers), manages settings, has a central map on which to see your data and allows for easy asset management including geofences, integrates Google StreetView capability and can produce a graph showing distance and speed over time.</p>
<p>The application is cross platform and runs already on Windows (XP/7/8), MacOSX, Linux and FreeBSD. It is written in Qt. To send commands to the tracker and receive the data, a simple GSM modem is used by the application. The Android version is being actively developed.</p>

<h2>Risks and challenges</h2>
<p>As always, there are some risks and challenges involved in a project like this, but we can mitigate most of them.</p>
<p>- Since this is based on an existing hardware platform with an existing software application, there is no development that needs to be done from scratch. The production version PCB is ready. The software is ready. Updates will always be possible to enhance functionality, but these are not critical to a fully working system.</p>
<p>- The experience of the team makes that none of the aspects of the project such as developing and commercializing hardware, writing and releasing software, managing projects and funds are new. Everyone on the team has a proven track record.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some other potential problems can arise:</p>
<p>- Component supply. If there are some components and modules with a larger than expected lead time, we might go over our estimated schedule. This is something we have experience with in the past, and we're trying to mitigate these situations to the best of our abilities, but it can be completely out of our hands. We have multiple suppliers lined up to mitigate this risk.</p>
<p>- Production. A lot of delays on projects like this one is producing in quantity. Building 200 units is not the same as building 2500. The logistics, set up times, and manufacturer choice are just a few of the variables here. For example, getting a batch of 100 units at a prototype facility may be all well and good, but if you suddenly need 1000 each month, this facility most likely will not be able to cover this. We have a range of suppliers and manufacturers lined up to make sure that we can produce any quantity we need. We don't rely on a single source for components, PCB's, etc. This alone means we can be as flexible as possible and not introduce delays due to lead times or congestion at one specific manufacturer.</p></span></span></div>","Thank you for checking out our project!

Introduction
Our tracking system has already come a long way before becoming an Indiegogo project. We developed the tracker for a pilot project at a company that was specifically looking for simplicity (both hardware and software wise), ease of use and low cost while also being able to be manufactured in non-optimal conditions: even soldered and assembled by hand with minimal training or older equipment. These goals were met within the pilot project; prototypes were produced on a small scale and the project was an overall success.

After the pilot project, we intend to commercialize the tracker on a larger scale, with a roadmap leading to more advanced trackers. We first tried to do this through a Kickstarter campaign, but we believe our funding goals were set too high, even though there were good reasons for the amount of money we asked for. We went back to the campaign drawing board and took input from our Kickstarter backers and critics - and here we are.
We had to make a few concessions on the software timeline, scaled back the roadmap and developed more aspects of the project on our own without relying on crowd funding. This is the reason we were able to scale back the funding from 80.000£ to the current 20.000£. There have been no concessions on hardware, quality, and our aim to manufacture in Europe and the States.
So what do we need the remaining funding for? Besides finalization, some minor tweaks and an initial production run set-up: the plastics. Building custom plastic enclosures is expensive due to the moulds required. The design is kept simple to keep the costs of the molds low, but will still run in the thousands of Euros.
One more important thing to know: for every pledge equal to or greater than 89£ we donate a tracker to the non-profit Technology for Change Foundation - in particular this project. Should you desire to financially contribute to this project, just add the amount you wish to donate to your pledge and let us know.

What can I track?
Basically anything you want! Some use case examples:
- Track your children coming from and going to school.
- Track your loved ones when they go on a trip. It gives you the ability to feel much closer to them even when they are away. Plus, you can guide them to local sights to see even when you're 1000 Miles away.
- Add the tracker to your dog's collar just in case.
- Use as a GPS data logger for geocaching or mapping, or to replay that hiking trip or bike ride you took.
- Use as an early car alarm system notifying when your car is moving when it shouldn't be.
- No more lost luggage, just drop the tracker in your case.
- Need to mail valuable items? Include your tracker in your package and you can follow it every step of the way.
- Moving home? Just pack a tracker and you’ll know exactly where your treasured belongings are.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Hi, my name is Philip Craig and I love changing peoples lives through fitness! <br/>As
 part of growing up the only thing I ever felt connected to was sports. I worked hard to be the best at everything I did, especially on the football 
field. Striving to be the best came at a heavy price with countless 
hours of training, going over plays, and pushing my body to places few 
people can go. This training encouraged me to graduate high school being
 first team all league and got me a football scholarship to college 
where I finished as an All American running back and received my BS in 
Movement of Sports Science. From there, I was given a once in a life time
 opportunity to travel to Germany to play in the European Football 
League.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Coming back from Germany, I tried countless NFL 
Combines where I just couldn't make my brake at the NFL. With failure all around me, one thing remained constant, 
my work ethic, which the Lord left me with  that changed not only my 
life but changed other peoples lives too. This work ethic pushed me to 
begin my own personal training business. As a trainer I was reliving my 
high school/college career through athletes by giving them the football 
knowledge I learned to get bigger, faster, and stronger and watch them 
grow as I did.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Just as my training career started, so did my 
CrossFit career. With crazy workouts, putting me on the floor, only 
after 5 minutes of work, I found a new way to push my body and a new 
way to implement athletes with training schemes and functional movements
 they could not only use on any field but in everyday life as well. 
After about a year of learning the methodology of CrossFit through the 
workouts, I decided to take my new found knowledge and apply it to 
everyday people to help them get fit, lose weight, compete against 
themselves and to have FUN! A year later, countless pounds and countless
 people have been changed due to CrossFit and Gods power to stick to a 
fitness program and reach their goals.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">That's where you come in.  
With your donation I will be able to get my own building to share my 
knowledge with countless people that want to get into shape, stay in 
shape or just give them something to do.  Each donation will bring me 
one step closer to achieving a plan to help the obesity crisis, giving 
children and kids activities and a  positive environment to be in and to
 be healthy.  Fitness, health, camaraderie, family, and competition are 
things I can bring to the table, all I need is capitol to make it all 
happen.  Please help me achieve a goal that I have set for myself, and 
when I achieve my goal it can help you achieve your goal of getting in 
shape! NOW GET OFF YOUR BUTT AND DONATE SO WE CAN GET TO WORK!!! </p>

<br/><br/><h3>What We Need</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This is the breakdown of what we are asking for:</p>
<p><br/></p></span><ul>
<li>Building ($5,000 Zoning Fee)</li>
<li>Gym Flooring ($3,000)</li>
<li>Pull Up Rig ($1,500)</li>
<li>Gym Name Fee ($3,000)</li>
<li>ANYTHING EXTRA WE MAKE WILL GO STRAIGHT TO THE GYM (WEIGHTS, DRY ERASE BOARDS ECT..) </li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<p>These are the main obstacles we're encountering with opening this gym.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We have a building location that is perfect but the zoning needs to be reevaluated for a fitness center. The City will approve the zoning once the fees are paid and all the necessary conditions of the facility are met.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Gym Flooring and Pull Up Rig come next. With heavy weight being lifted and dropped, we need thick rubber flooring that can absorb the shock. The Pull Up Rig is for doing Gymnastic movements such as Ring Pull Ups, Bar Muscle Ups and of course your regular Pull Ups and as well as being used for racking barbells for Squats, Bench Press and things alike when working out.</p>
<p>Last comes the Name of the Gym. We want to be affiliated as a CrossFit gym. There is a $3,000 fee that comes from the name alone.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">If we don't reach the funding, we will keep pressing forward. I will do anything and everything it takes to make this happen with relentless drive. This is important to me, and I will make it happen.</p>
<h3>The Impact<br/>
</h3>
<span class=""notranlsate""></span><span class=""notranlsate""></span><span class=""notranlsate""><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Bringing this fitness facility would make a huge impact on the community and the surrounding area. This is important because school athletes would have a place to workout to get better at their sport and get in shape as well as  adults and young children within the city. This would give residents an in-town place and not have to drive far to get a workout in. Exercising daily will help us be healthy and give us better lives and fight against the American obesity crisis.</p>

(Hoka Hey means, ""It's a good day to die."")


Matthew 16:25 ""For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it.""
We look at Hoka Hey twofold: As warriors willing to die for what we believe in and as men of God who seek the Lord by dying to ourselves everyday.



Hi, my name is Philip Craig and I love changing peoples lives through fitness! As
 part of growing up the only thing I ever felt connected to was sports. I worked hard to be the best at everything I did, especially on the football 
field. Striving to be the best came at a heavy price with countless 
hours of training, going over plays, and pushing my body to places few 
people can go. This training encouraged me to graduate high school being
 first team all league and got me a football scholarship to college 
where I finished as an All American running back and received my BS in 
Movement of Sports Science. From there, I was given a once in a life time
 opportunity to travel to Germany to play in the European Football 
League.
Coming back from Germany, I tried countless NFL 
Combines where I just couldn't make my brake at the NFL. With failure all around me, one thing remained constant, 
my work ethic, which the Lord left me with  that changed not only my 
life but changed other peoples lives too. This work ethic pushed me to 
begin my own personal training business. As a trainer I was reliving my 
high school/college career through athletes by giving them the football 
knowledge I learned to get bigger, faster, and stronger and watch them 
grow as I did.
Just as my training career started, so did my 
CrossFit career. With crazy workouts, putting me on the floor, only 
after 5 minutes of work, I found a new way to push my body and a new 
way to implement athletes with training schemes and functional movements
 they could not only use on any field but in everyday life as well. 
After about a year of learning the methodology of CrossFit through the 
workouts, I decided to take my new found knowledge and apply it to 
everyday people to help them get fit, lose weight, compete against 
themselves and to have FUN! A year later, countless pounds and countless
 people have been changed due to CrossFit and Gods power to stick to a 
fitness program and reach their goals.
That's where you come in.  
With your donation I will be able to get my own building to share my 
knowledge with countless people that want to get into shape, stay in 
shape or just give them something to do.  Each donation will bring me 
one step closer to achieving a plan to help the obesity crisis, giving 
children and kids activities and a  positive environment to be in and to
 be healthy.  Fitness, health, camaraderie, family, and competition are 
things I can bring to the table, all I need is capitol to make it all 
happen.  Please help me achieve a goal that I have set for myself, and 
when I achieve my goal it can help you achieve your goal of getting in 
shape! NOW GET OFF YOUR BUTT AND DONATE SO WE CAN GET TO WORK!!! 
THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS =)


What We Need

This is the breakdown of what we are asking for:

Building ($5,000 Zoning Fee)
Gym Flooring ($3,000)
Pull Up Rig ($1,500)
Gym Name Fee ($3,000)
ANYTHING EXTRA WE MAKE WILL GO STRAIGHT TO THE GYM (WEIGHTS, DRY ERASE BOARDS ECT..) 


These are the main obstacles we're encountering with opening this gym.
We have a building location that is perfect but the zoning needs to be reevaluated for a fitness center. The City will approve the zoning once the fees are paid and all the necessary conditions of the facility are met.
The Gym Flooring and Pull Up Rig come next. With heavy weight being lifted and dropped, we need thick rubber flooring that can absorb the shock. The Pull Up Rig is for doing Gymnastic movements such as Ring Pull Ups, Bar Muscle Ups and of course your regular Pull Ups and as well as being used for racking barbells for Squats, Bench Press and things alike when working out.
Last comes the Name of the Gym. We want to be affiliated as a CrossFit gym. There is a $3,000 fee that comes from the name alone.
If we don't reach the funding, we will keep pressing forward. I will do anything and everything it takes to make this happen with relentless drive. This is important to me, and I will make it happen.
The Impact

Bringing this fitness facility would make a huge impact on the community and the surrounding area. This is important because school athletes would have a place to workout to get better at their sport and get in shape as well as  adults and young children within the city. This would give residents an in-town place and not have to drive far to get a workout in. Exercising daily will help us be healthy and give us better lives and fight against the American obesity crisis.
We make it easy on you by planning out the workouts at weight for your strength, make it FUN and most of all make it FAMILY oriented to come in and reach goals we never thought possible.
My family impact
My family is the most important thing in my life!  I have a beautiful wife who is pregnant as we speak, and two handsome boys that are full of energy.  My wife who is a homemaker works tirelessly to take care of  my sons as I am working throughout the day.  With your help I will be able to take my business to the next level and provide for my family through the success of this venture.  The lord has provided so much for us and we use the talents that he has given us to empower others to reach their goals.

To help with both my passions, humans and animals, I would love to get certified as a Pet Therapy Team with my cat, Todd.

This amount adds up to between $215 and $265, depending on the cost of Todd's health certification. Indiegogo requires a minimum initial asking price of $500, so I've chosen the flexible funding option.

Are you a sea or water sports lover? Here is why you need this bag!Thousands of people become victims of theft at the beach every year, which leads to the unpleasant situation of not being able to relax because they must keep an eye out for their belongings, while instead, they should be chilling out and enjoying their vacation or their favorite water sport!Usually we place all our stuff in a sea bag and try to enjoy swimming. This can be quite an issue, since, no one really likes staying behind alone to watch out for such an occasion. We would hate to come back only to find everything stolen. A very unpleasant situation as you can imagine.Of course you could also try to hide them under the sand :)But don't worry. AquaSafeBag can solve this problem!What AquaSafeBag can do to solve this?AquaSafeBag deals with this problem by being made entirely of waterproof material, as well as having an airtight/waterproof case, that allows us to place our valuables inside and protect them from harm or theft. This special case, provides excellent protection against water and even if it is left unsealed, water still cannot penetrate it.Why is this so special? Well, we have taken it a step further by implementing a life preserver! In the small front pocket of the bag, we have placed an air cartridge that can make the life preserver spring out of its container and be fully fledged in less than 3 seconds by simply pulling a small cord.Just attach the air cartridge:Fold it and put it inside the bag:If you need to use it just pull the string:And the life preserver will automatically inflate in just 3 seconds:The preserver and the bag can be of course used as many times as you like, either by replacing the air cartridge or by just blowing in the tube.And don't worry about the cost of the air cartridge, we converted the air cartridge mechanism to use common affordable bike air cartridges (bike pumps) that can be found easily at various bike stores or other hardware shops.The life preserver can support enough weight for a big swimmer, and it is not just for personal use since it can be easily detached from the bag!Have you ever been for a swim and a person near you needs help?If we are not familiar with the correct way to assist that person, we might run into a very serious issue or other unpleasant scenarios.However by using AquaSafeBag, we can simply pull the cord:...and give that person the life preserver from a safe distance and then easily help that person swim out.So having AquaSafeBag with you makes you feel secure because it can help you in any case of panic, fear or sickness, while at the same time your personal items are secured with you.Use AQUASAFEBAG everywhereAquaSafeBag can be used in many cases where we cannot take things like our iPhone with us, since water can irreparably damage it. These cases could be:- All sorts of water sports like Water Ski, Kite Surfing etc- Swimmers- Fishers, sailers- LifeguardsOf course aside from the aforementioned uses, AquaSafeBag can be used for everyday activities since it's a really nice fit for men:or women:The idea is to just feel relaxed and secureBy using AquaSafeBag you can feel the required safety for you and your family since it can help someone in any case of panic, fear or injury when at the same time it keeps your belongings safe at all times.Fabric and design features:All fabric selections have been specifically chosen to make you feel great whilst everything is safe in the water resistant material. Zip pullers, size, heat transfer, labels and all accessories are carefully selected for best bag efficiency. Here's some of the technical details:

Nylon cloth: Nylon oxford (210D)

Nylon compound TPU: N210D / TPU 

Oral Tube: KQZ 

Webbing: D-66

How we did it (some history, some prototype designs and actual tests in the water)Christos invented the product after many different designs and variations. Here are some of the designs that he tried before the last improved design:Of course he didn't came up with the right combination right away! He spent many hours and effort and have designed many prototypes to get to the right one.Here are some of them:Prototype #3Prototype #6Prototype #7And here are some actual tests at the beach with different bags:And different life preserver sizes:And different inflation systems:Do you see the sand on the inflation devices? We tried it out over and over with as many different conditions as we could!Patent documentationChristos went a step further by filing a patent of his invention. Here is the PCT of the invention of AquaSafeBag:And here is the patent file for Greece (in Greek):AquaSafeBag has also made it to the Europe Enterprise Network web site which is the biggest European Technology Transfer Market!The next stepsWe are happy to be currently at final prototype stage on our first order batch. Our first 300 AquaSafeBags (first design version) are already here and have been quality control checked.On reaching our funding goal your money will go directly on moving the AquaSafeBag from final prototype stage into serious production numbers with a much lower cost. The original AquaSafeBag was created for local use but we decided to move it to production since the reviews to it from friends has been very enthusiastic.

I’m Mike, a local organic farmer here in Ottawa, Ontario.  Below
you will find more information about my certified organic market garden,
founded in 2012, currently completing it’s first year of operation on River
Road as well as my hopes for the future of Mike’s Garden Harvest.</p><p>It has been an excellent season!  I have grown vegetables for 32 local families,
been to the <a href=""http://www.farmersmarketsontario.com/MarketDetails.cfm?uSearchString=&amp;uPageNum=1&amp;uMarketID=88"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Parkdale Market</a> and become a member of <a href=""http://www.savourottawa.ca/profiles_en/mikes-garden-harvest.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Savour Ottawa</a> raising the
farm's profile among the restaurant community. My submitted crop plan to <i>MyPick Ontario</i> passed and I became a verified local commercial grower. I also managed to earn my organic certification from <i>Ecocert Canada</i>, after their rigorous inspection of my field.</p><b>
</b><p>Before
starting my current farm, I spent over a year searching to find a spot with
the ideal growing conditions. I feel truly fortunate to have found just such a
field with good earth, excellent airflow and full sunlight in such close
proximity to my current and potential markets.</p>
<p>After
looking at a lot of different models, I determined that my crop plan would
based on a farm of a very similar size located in southern Quebec run by a man
named Jean-Martin Fortier and his wife Maude-Helene Desroches. Now in their
tenth year, their emphasis is to ""grow better not bigger"", where they
have perfected a successful micro-farm system which is both highly productive
and profitable.</p>
<p>I
have my feet planted firmly in the soil; I don’t expect <i>Mike’s Garden Harvest</i>
to be able to immediately emulate <i>Les Jardins de la Grelinette</i>. <br/><br/>
My priorities this year have been to: <br/>
- increase my share base<br/>
- get the feel of the soil at my new location<br/>
- contrast my projected numbers with the results I achieved as my crop plan was
put in motion<br/><br/>
This might not sound very earthy but it needs to be done to ensure the farm is
viable.<br/><br/>
Which brings me to why I am seeking help funding my dream on Indiegogo. </p>
<p>As
I indicated in my video, building a system of raised 30"" beds with
18"" walkways using a BCS 739 two-wheel tractor to maximize the space I
have is the next step. It's a diesel tractor and very fuel efficient with  some very innovative attachments. 
The most important of which is the rotary power harrow that allows me to
work the surface without inverting the layers of the soil protecting its’
structure.</p>
<p>In
addition, floating row covers to protect my crops from frost and insects will
both lengthen my season and expand where I can sell my produce. It will cost
about 4,500 dollars in total but with care much of this can be used for a
number of years.</p>
<p>I
am also aiming to install high tunnels so I can string tomatoes and cucumber
protecting them from blights and bugs.  </p>
<p>Compared
to the conventional farming systems that I knew as a youth and studied at the University
of Guelph, the capital investment is marginal. However, from my vantage point
it, at this juncture, it is out of reach for me. </p>
<p>So...
this is me asking you, my neighbour, for a boost as I prepare my field for a
good start in 2015. I am quite resourceful and can make a little go a long way.
I already have an eye on a barely used BCS tractor and a complete set of
attachment for under $10,000. I also know where I can get some old greenhouse
hoops for cheap.  So your hard earned
support will work as hard for me as you did for it.</p><p><span>As
for me, it is fair to say that I am as far from a 'tree hugger' as you are
going to find in organic circles. But I truly believe in in the importance of
growing food honestly and with care, the way it is meant be grown. The way it is meant
to be consumed.</span></p><p><span><span>Thank
you for this time, your consideration of this project and please at the very
least I ask that your response be to share my venture with others who you
believe might share this passion. Any questions or insights that you might have
can always be directed to me. This is all of me in the writing and so with
that, I wish you and your family an excellent day! </span></span></p>

I’m Mike, a local organic farmer here in Ottawa, Ontario.  Below
you will find more information about my certified organic market garden,
founded in 2012, currently completing it’s first year of operation on River
Road as well as my hopes for the future of Mike’s Garden Harvest.It has been an excellent season!  I have grown vegetables for 32 local families,
been to the Parkdale Market and become a member of Savour Ottawa raising the
farm's profile among the restaurant community. My submitted crop plan to MyPick Ontario passed and I became a verified local commercial grower. I also managed to earn my organic certification from Ecocert Canada, after their rigorous inspection of my field.
Before
starting my current farm, I spent over a year searching to find a spot with
the ideal growing conditions. I feel truly fortunate to have found just such a
field with good earth, excellent airflow and full sunlight in such close
proximity to my current and potential markets.
After
looking at a lot of different models, I determined that my crop plan would
based on a farm of a very similar size located in southern Quebec run by a man
named Jean-Martin Fortier and his wife Maude-Helene Desroches. Now in their
tenth year, their emphasis is to ""grow better not bigger"", where they
have perfected a successful micro-farm system which is both highly productive
and profitable.
I
have my feet planted firmly in the soil; I don’t expect Mike’s Garden Harvest
to be able to immediately emulate Les Jardins de la Grelinette. 
My priorities this year have been to: 
- increase my share base
- get the feel of the soil at my new location
- contrast my projected numbers with the results I achieved as my crop plan was
put in motion
This might not sound very earthy but it needs to be done to ensure the farm is
viable.
Which brings me to why I am seeking help funding my dream on Indiegogo. 
As
I indicated in my video, building a system of raised 30"" beds with
18"" walkways using a BCS 739 two-wheel tractor to maximize the space I
have is the next step. It's a diesel tractor and very fuel efficient with  some very innovative attachments. 
The most important of which is the rotary power harrow that allows me to
work the surface without inverting the layers of the soil protecting its’
structure.
In
addition, floating row covers to protect my crops from frost and insects will
both lengthen my season and expand where I can sell my produce. It will cost
about 4,500 dollars in total but with care much of this can be used for a
number of years.
I
am also aiming to install high tunnels so I can string tomatoes and cucumber
protecting them from blights and bugs.  
Compared
to the conventional farming systems that I knew as a youth and studied at the University
of Guelph, the capital investment is marginal. However, from my vantage point
it, at this juncture, it is out of reach for me. 
So...
this is me asking you, my neighbour, for a boost as I prepare my field for a
good start in 2015. I am quite resourceful and can make a little go a long way.
I already have an eye on a barely used BCS tractor and a complete set of
attachment for under $10,000. I also know where I can get some old greenhouse
hoops for cheap.  So your hard earned
support will work as hard for me as you did for it.As
for me, it is fair to say that I am as far from a 'tree hugger' as you are
going to find in organic circles. But I truly believe in in the importance of
growing food honestly and with care, the way it is meant be grown. The way it is meant
to be consumed.Thank
you for this time, your consideration of this project and please at the very
least I ask that your response be to share my venture with others who you
believe might share this passion. Any questions or insights that you might have
can always be directed to me. This is all of me in the writing and so with
that, I wish you and your family an excellent day!

I went through nearly 2 years trying to get a diagnosis for what was wrong with me. That involved multiple expensive procedures (multiple MRI's, CT Scans, nerve conduction studies, heart monitoring, etc). Despite having health insurance, I had to pay for my diagnostic years on my credit card. I moved to a tiny house for cheap rent. Then, when I finally got a diagnosis and a treatment plan, I sold my favorite Subaru and rode a bike or scooter year round. After that money ran out, I took out 2 personal loans. After that money ran out, I tried to take out another loan, and was of course denied. As a last resort, I took the money out of my 401K. My debt to income ratio is now too high, my credit is maxed out, and I have nothing that I actually own. I am not saying this to paint a poor- pitiful-me picture. I am saying this, because I want you to know that I have tried. Also, I want people to know what a terrible situation Lyme patients are in with denial from insurance companies. Something has to change!<div>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">The Numbers</span><br/></p>
<p>Thankfully, I am able to work about 32 hours a week now, which I am incredibly grateful for! I work as a geologist in environmental cleanup. All of my income goes towards minimum payments on my multiple loans and credit cards from medical expenses, my student loans, rent, food, body work to help my muscles deal with infection and treatment, and regular visits to a somatic psychotherapist to help heal my damaged nervous system and learn how to live with chronic pain. Since I am still paying for previous treatment, I have no funds available to pay for current treatment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My current debt is $52,500.</p>
<p>My treatments costs $1,900 per month. That's $22,800 per year.</p>
<p>My treatment consists of multiple antibiotics, high-dose prescription vitamins, herbs, minerals, enzymes, and high-dose probiotics. </p>
<p>To give you an idea of where my cost comes from, just my probiotics alone cost $300 per month. </p>
<p>There is no Lyme doctor in-network for my insurance. </p>
<p>Insurance companies go by out-dated treatment guidelines for Lyme patients and therefore, deny new treatments.</p>
<p>Also, even if they did update their treatment guidelines, many of the things that are crucial to recovery from Lyme Disease, like high-dose vitamins, are never covered by any insurance company for any reason. </p>
<p>We all know the system is broken. We are going to have to help each other. I am humbly asking for help.</p>

<p></p>
<h3>It All Adds Up</h3>
<p></p>
<p>I am asking for enough money to cover the next 3 years of my treatment, which is about $68,000. The money will go directly into an account that I have created specifically for treatment alone and will not be used for anything else. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Every little bit that is contributed really adds up! If you can't contribute, it's just as important to share this campaign with anyone you can. Let's see how far we can spread awareness on an issue that is just recently gaining exposure!</p>
<p>I could reach my goal if 680 people donate $100. </p>
<p>Or if 6,800 people donate $10. </p>
<p>Maybe it's possible!</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact<br/>
</h3>
<p>If this campaign is successful, the impact it will have on my life will be monumental. Just the stress relief from knowing that I don't have to worry about what will happen if I have to stop treatment, is healing in itself. If this campaign is successful, I believe that I will fully recover (in time) from Late-Stage Lyme. I will be able to help so many others on their journey learn how to change their lifestyle for healing and move through this illness a little easier. </p>
<p>If my treatment is covered, I can think about my future in a different light. Maybe I would have the chance to buy a car again or have the option of having a family someday. </p>
<p>More importantly, if I recover faster and I am still in remission after 3 years, I will give the money to someone else to cover their treatment! How fun would that be?</p>
<p>Additionally, if I reach my goal of $68,000, I will donate $1,000 to the LymeLight Foundation. The LymeLight Foundation helps raise money to fund treatment for children. Please help me reach this goal and have the chance to change the life of a child with Lyme!</p>

My debt to income ratio is now too high, my credit is maxed out, and I have nothing that I actually own. I am not saying this to paint a poor- pitiful-me picture. I am saying this, because I want you to know that I have tried. Also, I want people to know what a terrible situation Lyme patients are in with denial from insurance companies. Something has to change!





The Numbers
Thankfully, I am able to work about 32 hours a week now, which I am incredibly grateful for! I work as a geologist in environmental cleanup. All of my income goes towards minimum payments on my multiple loans and credit cards from medical expenses, my student loans, rent, food, body work to help my muscles deal with infection and treatment, and regular visits to a somatic psychotherapist to help heal my damaged nervous system and learn how to live with chronic pain. Since I am still paying for previous treatment, I have no funds available to pay for current treatment.
 
My current debt is $52,500.
My treatments costs $1,900 per month. That's $22,800 per year.
My treatment consists of multiple antibiotics, high-dose prescription vitamins, herbs, minerals, enzymes, and high-dose probiotics. 
To give you an idea of where my cost comes from, just my probiotics alone cost $300 per month. 
There is no Lyme doctor in-network for my insurance. 
Insurance companies go by out-dated treatment guidelines for Lyme patients and therefore, deny new treatments.
Also, even if they did update their treatment guidelines, many of the things that are crucial to recovery from Lyme Disease, like high-dose vitamins, are never covered by any insurance company for any reason. 
We all know the system is broken. We are going to have to help each other. I am humbly asking for help.




It All Adds Up

I am asking for enough money to cover the next 3 years of my treatment, which is about $68,000. The money will go directly into an account that I have created specifically for treatment alone and will not be used for anything else. 

Every little bit that is contributed really adds up! If you can't contribute, it's just as important to share this campaign with anyone you can. Let's see how far we can spread awareness on an issue that is just recently gaining exposure!
I could reach my goal if 680 people donate $100. 
Or if 6,800 people donate $10. 
Maybe it's possible!




The Impact

If this campaign is successful, the impact it will have on my life will be monumental. Just the stress relief from knowing that I don't have to worry about what will happen if I have to stop treatment, is healing in itself. If this campaign is successful, I believe that I will fully recover (in time) from Late-Stage Lyme. I will be able to help so many others on their journey learn how to change their lifestyle for healing and move through this illness a little easier. 
If my treatment is covered, I can think about my future in a different light. Maybe I would have the chance to buy a car again or have the option of having a family someday. 
More importantly, if I recover faster and I am still in remission after 3 years, I will give the money to someone else to cover their treatment! How fun would that be?
Additionally, if I reach my goal of $68,000, I will donate $1,000 to the LymeLight Foundation. The LymeLight Foundation helps raise money to fund treatment for children. Please help me reach this goal and have the chance to change the life of a child with Lyme!




My Promise To YouI believe that we are all connected and we all need support at some time in our lives. If you are able to help me by contributing in any amount or by sharing my story with others, my promise to you is that I will live the rest of my life with gratitude and focus on community. I will help anyone I can whenever I can. I will work to raise awareness about Lyme Disease, educate others on prevention, and contribute to research working towards a cure. 

Spread the Word!
Please help spread the word about this campaign. Facebook, twitter, blogs, websites, emails. Part of my mission is to spread Lyme Disease awareness, so please share my story with everyone you can. Protect yourself and your family from Lyme Disease!

THANK YOU FOR BEING PART OF MY JOURNEY!
 
With So Much Love and Appreciation,
Lyndsey

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
Last week I was accepted to massage school.  On the spot I was offered a $1400 scholarship and was approved for financing. All that separates me from attending Kneaded Energy School of Massage is a deposit of $1000, ideally turned in by August 1st, but there is some wiggle room as far as that goes. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>But this is only the beginning of a much bigger goal of mine that, if I can get this license, will positively affect the lives of many.</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
My bare minimum needs are simply $1000.  Anything raised above that will contribute to my monthly tuition payments of $288 per month as well as any ongoing needs while in the program.  In a very optimistic situation, where my total tuition is covered, I will be using the leftover funds from this campaign to contribute to an organization that will bring ""good touch"" into the lives of those who had hope ripped from them.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I can't offer much in return immediately except offering to practice on you what I learn in classes.  I will be learning the basics of many different styles of massage for an array of personal needs.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Going to massage school is just the first step towards a much bigger, much more important goal of mine.  While in school, I will be working on a plan to start an organization that works closely with mental health care professionals in order to reintroduce ""healthy touch"" to survivors of physical and sexual abuse.</p>
<p>Touch is a basic human need and it's heart breaking to think of how many people get stuck in a cycle of returning to their abusers, either because it's all they know, or they are afraid of even good touch. With the help of other caring massage therapists and mental health care professionals, I aim to help these individuals regain their strength and confidence that not all touch is harmful.</p>
<p><br/>The massage therapists who get on board with this will train in counselling and to read the boundaries of these individuals, and only progress at a comfortable rate for the client.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
I understand if you can't help financially, but you can still contribute by spreading the word.  $1000 really is such a small amount of money, I just wasn't prepared to have dish it out so suddenly.</div></div>","Short Summary

A few months ago her teeth started breaking off, small pieces at a time. We knew she had a problem with dry mouth from medications and possibly from medical conditions but it turned out that her saliva is almost absent from her mouth. As a result, her teeth are ruined at no fault of her own. There was nothing she could do as reinforced by her dentist. We were told by her dentist that they can't be saved. Any repair work we have done on them will just need to be redone every 1-2 years and eventually they will become unrepairable. This was the second opinion, Individual dental implants will not work as the lack of saliva will undermine them and bone will erode. Her only option is implanted dentures. Dentures that are screwed into the bone. With regular denture use the bone in the jaw breaks down over time. Since she is only 20, that would disfigure her at a very young age. Implants into the jaw to fasten the dentures in her mouth act as tooth roots and prevent bone loss therefor preventing the disfiguring effects. We need your help badly. The cost of extracting the remaining teeth, the specialized dentures and the cost of implants is around $52,000. Insurance won't cover this type of surgical procedure. Katelyn helps everyone, human or animal. She is kind and thoughtful and never asks for anything in return. Those of you who know her know this well. But this time, she needs YOUR help. Katelyn is devastated by this new problem. She knows I can't afford what she needs and was hoping for help within the family because this problem is very embarrassing to her, but I just don't have the resources and she MUST have this type of procedure due to her tender young age.  Katelyn, (an honor student, an American Scholar)  plans on becoming a veterinarian,  and she will be a great one. Her compassion and kind heart will make her one of the best. She always helps anyone who needs help whenever she can and has saved 8 litters of kittens, a few dogs and even wildlife. She needs these specific type of dentures and soon. Her teeth are disintegrating on a daily basis and won't last long. I have to have the money secured before the dentist and oral surgeon will start the work which will take several months to complete.  I even tried The Ellen show, sending 4 requests a day for over a month with no luck.

Thanks.<br/></p></div>","My daughter, Katelyn, who just turned 20, has been dealing with some major medical issues since 2009 including a severe form of POTS. A few months ago her teeth started breaking off, small pieces at a time. We knew she had a problem with dry mouth from medications and possibly from medical conditions but it turned out that her saliva is almost absent from her mouth. As a result, her teeth are ruined at no fault of her own. There was nothing she could do as reinforced by her dentist. We were told by her dentist that they can't be saved. Any repair work we have done on them will just need to be redone every 1-2 years and eventually they will become unrepairable. This was the second opinion, Individual dental implants will not work as the lack of saliva will undermine them and bone will erode. Her only option is implanted dentures. Dentures that are screwed into the bone. With regular denture use the bone in the jaw breaks down over time. Since she is only 20, that would disfigure her at a very young age. Implants into the jaw to fasten the dentures in her mouth act as tooth roots and prevent bone loss therefor preventing the disfiguring effects. We need your help badly. The cost of extracting the remaining teeth, the specialized dentures and the cost of implants is around $52,000. Insurance won't cover this type of surgical procedure. Katelyn helps everyone, human or animal. She is kind and thoughtful and never asks for anything in return. Those of you who know her know this well. But this time, she needs YOUR help. Katelyn is devastated by this new problem. She knows I can't afford what she needs and was hoping for help within the family because this problem is very embarrassing to her, but I just don't have the resources and she MUST have this type of procedure due to her tender young age.  Katelyn, (an honor student, an American Scholar)  plans on becoming a veterinarian,  and she will be a great one. Her compassion and kind heart will make her one of the best. She always helps anyone who needs help whenever she can and has saved 8 litters of kittens, a few dogs and even wildlife. She needs these specific type of dentures and soon. Her teeth are disintegrating on a daily basis and won't last long. I have to have the money secured before the dentist and oral surgeon will start the work which will take several months to complete.  I even tried The Ellen show, sending 4 requests a day for over a month with no luck. I thought if we got on the show not only would Katelyn get help but also bring awareness of the severe damage dry mouth can cause. Any help you can give (donations, support, suggestions or even passing our story along) will be deeply appreciated. Your help will literally improve the life of someone kind-hearted and giving who gives every chance she gets.  P.S.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""> <h3>As I live and breathe.</h3> <p>I am very ill.  I have a degenerative lung disease called <i>Pulmonary Fibrosis</i>, the result of repeated bouts of pneumonia complicated by rheumatoid arthritis.  Simply put, fibres are growing in my lungs and reducing my ability to breathe.</p>
<p>My last Pulmonary Function Test (six months ago) measured my lung capacity at 50%.  I feel like it has deteriorated since then, but tests in September will show for sure where I am at.</p>
<p>My doctors and specialists estimate that, without treatment, I have three to five years before my lungs cease their function altogether.  </p><p>That is the <i><b>first option</b></i> presented to me by Dr. Ian Waters, my respirologist: Do Nothing.   He is a very nice man and a fine doctor with the difficult task of dispensing bad news.  He told me that I could carry on for a few years with just minor deterioration until a sudden decline takes away my remaining lung capacity in very short order.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Waters, my <b><i>second option</i></b> is treatment with pharmaceuticals.  The treatment is about 50% effective, that is: the pharmaceuticals work in about half the cases.  ""Work"" in this context means that treatment 'may' slow down the fibre growth. There is no cure, according to my doctors, but this option may extend my life a little.  There may be side effects with these pharmaceuticals, but Dr. Waters said that these can be dealt with by more pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>The <i><b>third option</b></i> is lung transplant.   <i>If</i>  I survive a lung transplant surgery, I will have a less than 50% chance of living 5 years.  I will live on anti-rejection drugs which have potential side effects affecting liver, kidney, heart and brain.  There are other pharmaceuticals that will address the side effects of the first.  I will be very sick for a while, immune system kaput and energy weak.  Quality of life can be okay after a lung transplant.  Dr. Waters likes to talk about one young fella who had a transplant and now rides the Rocky Mountains on a bicycle on his new lung.  I am not so optimistic about the odds.   I have a few good years (decades, even!) left in me, but I am not a young fella.  If my body rejects the transplanted lung, it is unlikely I will be eligible for another due to my age.  They generally balk at lung transplants when the recipient is over 65, as I will be in two years.</p><p>Lung transplants cost (according to the surgeon and the surgical nurse who interviewed me at the transplant clinic) between one and two million dollars.  Our socialized medical program will pay for this.  Remember this.  Our BC Medical will pay a minimum of one million dollars to give me another person's lung that may (or may not) help me to live another five years.<br/></p><p>There is something else.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">During the two years, while I was undergoing diagnosis, it became very obvious to me that I was deathly ill and, as my condition worsened, not one health practitioner, from the specialists and surgeons to the nurses and technicians offered me any hope of surviving this horrible disease beyond a few years.</span><br/></p><p></p><h3></h3><p>I am not despairing, however, and I will tell you why.</p><h3>What now?</h3><p>I decided to seek another route.</p>
<p>I called upon a doctor of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Dr. Fei Yang.  ( <a href=""http://www.drfeiyang.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.drfeiyang.ca/</a> )</p><p>When I told her, over the telephone, what my condition was Dr. Fei responded with ""We will fix those lungs of yours.""  What?  Fix my lungs?  Did she just promise to cure my incurable lung disease?</p>
<p>I went to visit her.  During that first consultation she confirmed that she would cure my Pulmonary Fibrosis.</p>
<p>Before we begin to work on my lungs, however, Dr. Fei said, we must address the cause of my illness, the rheumatoid arthritis, and cure it.</p>
<p>Over the last year and a half, we have done that.  I no longer have pain in my wrists, shoulders, hands and feet.  The swelling in those areas has gone.  </p>
<p>Although Western Medicine says that there is no cure for it, I no longer suffer from rheumatoid arthritis. </p>
<p>It has not been easy.  I got very sick at times and in addition, it was very expensive. Traditional Chinese Medicine is not covered by our wonderful health plan.</p>
<p>But I have made it this far.  For the first time in almost a decade, I can make a fist.  I can open jars and doors without pain.  I can sleep on my side without pain in my shoulders.  </p><p>Dr. Fei cured me.  I believe in her.  What is more important is that she has given me hope.  </p><p>Hope that we can cure my lung disease.</p>
<p></p><h3>The Cure.</h3><div>
<p>Dr. Fei says it will take two to five years to cure my Pulmonary Fibrosis.   She says I will become very ill, much more than present, because I must journey through this illness in order to confront it and expel it from my body.  We will do that, she says, through use of herbs and acupuncture, counselling  and nutrition and life style change.  </p>
<p>And I believe her.  </p>
<p>I will be cured.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>My Situation</h3>
<p>I am currently able to work only in flexible circumstances and with light physical requirements.  I tire easily and lack stamina.  Any exertion sends me running for my oxygen tank in order to catch my breath.  I cannot hold down or sustain a full-time job.  My income has been severely impacted by this disease. </p>
<p>I have approached Human Resources for assistance.  I am ineligible for a disability pension because I have been collecting my CPP ($130 per month!) for more than fifteen months.</p>
<p>So I need assistance, both with the fees associated with my treatment and with income in order to live when I become entirely unable to work.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>This is my campaign:</h3>
<p>To raise funds to pay for my treatment and to sustain and support me while I heal.</p>
<p>Like any system of medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine is expensive.  Unlike our Western Medicine, this treatment is not covered by our Canadian Health Care program.</p>
<p>I will be visiting Dr. Fei twice a week for treatment.  A single half-hour consultation costs $80.  This compares favourably to Western Medicine.  </p>
<p>The herbs and medicines used in my treatment also compare very well in price to Western treatments like chemotherapy or dialysis. </p>
<p>The combined cost of consultations,  and treatments such as acupuncture and herbal medicines will be 1,200 dollars per month.  Over five years, this amounts to 72,000 dollars.  I have chosen to be optimistic and have set a goal for three years of treatment, totaling 43,200 dollars.  </p>
<p>For the duration of this campaign, I have budgeted 1,000 dollars per month living expenses.  I currently have a small monthly pension and hope to work part-time during at least some of the time but I will likely have to give up much of my working income during the period of my treatment.  As Dr. Fei says, getting well is my full-time job now.  I gather that I will be too ill most of the time to do much else.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>The total goal of this funding campaign is 79,200 dollars.  This will see me through three years of treatment with support for living.</p>
<p>This is a huge amount, an ambitious goal and is som<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">ewhat daunting (though not as intimidating as this disease!).  I thought of breaking it down to yearly increments of 26,400 dollars and an annual breakdown will be my personal measure of progress for this fund raising campaign, by years rather than dollars.</span></p>
<p>26,400 dollars will see me through one year.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">52,800 dollars funds two years of treatment.</span></p>
<p>79,200 dollars will cover the three years I anticipate being in treatment.</p>
<p>If my treatment takes longer, then I will have to seek further funding to cover it.</p>
<p>I have considered what to do with the funding, should we not reach the ultimate goal.  </p>
<p>Whatever amount is raised will be applied to my treatment first and my living expenses second.  My goal is to get well.  That is what this campaign is all about: curing me of this disease so I can once again be healthy and productive.</p>
<p>Treatment alone for one year costs 14,400 dollars.  For two years 28,800 and for three years, 43,200 dollars.  </p>
<p>(Remember that a lung transplant would cost a minimum of 
one million dollars and BC Med would cover that cost.  It will not cover
 the cost of this treatment.)<br/></p>
<p>We plan on embarking upon treatment to save and restore my lungs in September.  By late September, I should have a good idea of how we stand in terms of fund-raising.  I hope to be close to our goal but understand that we may not fully succeed.  I will proceed with however much treatment I can then afford.  Perhaps I will launch another campaign in the future to help pay for any shortfall from this one.  </p>
<p>In the interim, I will focus on this campaign and hope that help will come from my friends and community and beyond.</p>

<p>As I live and breathe...</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div></div>","As I live and breathe. I am very ill.  I have a degenerative lung disease called Pulmonary Fibrosis, the result of repeated bouts of pneumonia complicated by rheumatoid arthritis.  Simply put, fibres are growing in my lungs and reducing my ability to breathe.
My last Pulmonary Function Test (six months ago) measured my lung capacity at 50%.  I feel like it has deteriorated since then, but tests in September will show for sure where I am at.
My doctors and specialists estimate that, without treatment, I have three to five years before my lungs cease their function altogether.  That is the first option presented to me by Dr. Ian Waters, my respirologist: Do Nothing.   He is a very nice man and a fine doctor with the difficult task of dispensing bad news.  He told me that I could carry on for a few years with just minor deterioration until a sudden decline takes away my remaining lung capacity in very short order.
According to Dr. Waters, my second option is treatment with pharmaceuticals.  The treatment is about 50% effective, that is: the pharmaceuticals work in about half the cases.  ""Work"" in this context means that treatment 'may' slow down the fibre growth. There is no cure, according to my doctors, but this option may extend my life a little.  There may be side effects with these pharmaceuticals, but Dr. Waters said that these can be dealt with by more pharmaceuticals.
The third option is lung transplant.   If  I survive a lung transplant surgery, I will have a less than 50% chance of living 5 years.  I will live on anti-rejection drugs which have potential side effects affecting liver, kidney, heart and brain.  There are other pharmaceuticals that will address the side effects of the first.  I will be very sick for a while, immune system kaput and energy weak.  Quality of life can be okay after a lung transplant.  Dr. Waters likes to talk about one young fella who had a transplant and now rides the Rocky Mountains on a bicycle on his new lung.  I am not so optimistic about the odds.   I have a few good years (decades, even!) left in me, but I am not a young fella.  If my body rejects the transplanted lung, it is unlikely I will be eligible for another due to my age.  They generally balk at lung transplants when the recipient is over 65, as I will be in two years.Lung transplants cost (according to the surgeon and the surgical nurse who interviewed me at the transplant clinic) between one and two million dollars.  Our socialized medical program will pay for this.  Remember this.  Our BC Medical will pay a minimum of one million dollars to give me another person's lung that may (or may not) help me to live another five years.There is something else.
During the two years, while I was undergoing diagnosis, it became very obvious to me that I was deathly ill and, as my condition worsened, not one health practitioner, from the specialists and surgeons to the nurses and technicians offered me any hope of surviving this horrible disease beyond a few years.I am not despairing, however, and I will tell you why.What now?I decided to seek another route.
I called upon a doctor of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Dr. Fei Yang.  ( http://www.drfeiyang.ca/ )When I told her, over the telephone, what my condition was Dr. Fei responded with ""We will fix those lungs of yours.""  What?  Fix my lungs?  Did she just promise to cure my incurable lung disease?
I went to visit her.  During that first consultation she confirmed that she would cure my Pulmonary Fibrosis.
Before we begin to work on my lungs, however, Dr. Fei said, we must address the cause of my illness, the rheumatoid arthritis, and cure it.
Over the last year and a half, we have done that.  I no longer have pain in my wrists, shoulders, hands and feet.  The swelling in those areas has gone.  
Although Western Medicine says that there is no cure for it, I no longer suffer from rheumatoid arthritis. 
It has not been easy.  I got very sick at times and in addition, it was very expensive. Traditional Chinese Medicine is not covered by our wonderful health plan.
But I have made it this far.  For the first time in almost a decade, I can make a fist.  I can open jars and doors without pain.  I can sleep on my side without pain in my shoulders.  Dr. Fei cured me.  I believe in her.  What is more important is that she has given me hope.  Hope that we can cure my lung disease.
The Cure.
Dr. Fei says it will take two to five years to cure my Pulmonary Fibrosis.   She says I will become very ill, much more than present, because I must journey through this illness in order to confront it and expel it from my body.  We will do that, she says, through use of herbs and acupuncture, counselling  and nutrition and life style change.  
And I believe her.  
I will be cured.

My Situation
I am currently able to work only in flexible circumstances and with light physical requirements.  I tire easily and lack stamina.  Any exertion sends me running for my oxygen tank in order to catch my breath.  I cannot hold down or sustain a full-time job.  My income has been severely impacted by this disease. 
I have approached Human Resources for assistance.  I am ineligible for a disability pension because I have been collecting my CPP ($130 per month!) for more than fifteen months.
So I need assistance, both with the fees associated with my treatment and with income in order to live when I become entirely unable to work.

This is my campaign:
To raise funds to pay for my treatment and to sustain and support me while I heal.
Like any system of medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine is expensive.  Unlike our Western Medicine, this treatment is not covered by our Canadian Health Care program.
I will be visiting Dr. Fei twice a week for treatment.  A single half-hour consultation costs $80.  This compares favourably to Western Medicine.

The Goal
The total goal of this funding campaign is 79,200 dollars.  This will see me through three years of treatment with support for living.
This is a huge amount, an ambitious goal and is somewhat daunting (though not as intimidating as this disease!).  I thought of breaking it down to yearly increments of 26,400 dollars and an annual breakdown will be my personal measure of progress for this fund raising campaign, by years rather than dollars.
26,400 dollars will see me through one year.
52,800 dollars funds two years of treatment.
79,200 dollars will cover the three years I anticipate being in treatment.
If my treatment takes longer, then I will have to seek further funding to cover it.
I have considered what to do with the funding, should we not reach the ultimate goal.  
Whatever amount is raised will be applied to my treatment first and my living expenses second.  My goal is to get well.  That is what this campaign is all about: curing me of this disease so I can once again be healthy and productive.

personally thank you for taking time to look at our product page.  Our
team is extremely passionate about Nite Track.  We have no doubt that
given the opportunity to succeed, it will change the way you look at night time
activities.2</p>
<p>Nite Track was created
by a group of four guys who came together through professional affiliations and
friendship. Our technical, market and product expertise is based on years of
technology application and operational experience in various industries. <i><b> Our overall goal with Nite Track is to provide outdoor enthusiasts  a great performing, hands free, night vision platform
at </b><u><b>an affordable price</b></u><b>. </b></i></p>
<p>If you’ve ever walked
through woods at night with a night vision monocular or tried to navigate a
small boat at night while holding a scope to your eye, you will appreciate Nite
Track’s enhanced situational awareness, depth perception and ease of use. 
Operationally, it will bring a high performance night vision system
on par with major marine systems costing over $10,000 at a small fraction of
the price.  Yet, Nite Track is much more adaptive and versatile.</p>
<p>We’ve been
collaborating on Nite Track for over a year and field testing for over six
months. As we’ve built prototypes, gathered data and accumulated results, we’ve
defined a product that meets our specifications for performance, ruggedness,
versatility and reliability.  We humbly yet confidently hope our project
will receive your support and enthusiasm! We know Nite Track is a viable and
innovative product with great potential and with your backing we can begin the
process of bringing it to production.  Please contact us if you have any questions or would like more information by using this email address:<b> <u>nitetrackinfo@gmail.com</u></b></p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>So, what is Nite
Track?</b></p>
<p>Nite Track is a new hands
free night vision product used by outdoor adventurers to safely increase their
activities into the night. Boating, off-road applications, hunting, farming,
ranching and anything else outdoors where being able to comfortably see at
night is important.</p><p><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'></span></p><p><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'></span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/984948/files/20141104054544-NT_Final.jpg?1415108744"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

</div><p><span>These features are particularly important for night time
boating and off road use.  Night
time navigation can be extremely challenging even for the most experienced
operators. Getting lost, running aground or colliding with other objects  is a very real hazard and keeps many people off the water at night and from many other night time activities.  Nite Track
has three main goals;</span></p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p><span>1.<span> 
</span></span>To be able to safely, comfortably and
confidently boat at night</p><div>
</div><p><span>2.<span> 
</span></span>To be widely affordable and simple to install
and use on any boat, vehicle or even structure</p><div>
</div><p><span>3.<span> 
</span></span>To positively enhance night time recreational
activities for the broadest range of people possible.<br/></p><div>
</div><p><b>Nite Track has several features that differentiate it from
anything else available.</b></p><div>
</div><p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>As a <i>hands free</i> system, Nite Track can be remotely placed and remotely viewed on a flat screen display.
Being able to refer to the displayed image as needed, the user doesn’t have
to hassle with mounting head-worn devices or holding a monocular up to their
eye. This<i> greatly</i> <b>improves overall situational awareness</b> and also allows
others nearby to share the image. </p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/972938/files/20141030175245-7_inch_monitor_on_dash.jpg?1414716765"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div>
<br/>
</div><p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>The black/white image allows for great detail,
even ability to read text. Thermal imagers cannot do this nor can they “see”
the stars, moon, clouds, buoy numbers or signs. </p><div>
</div><p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Unlike image intensifiers or thermal imagers,
Nite Track can use any standard video lens desired. The standard lens supplied
is an HD 35mm lens which produces <b>an image approximate to the human eye,</b>
meaning that images are about as far away as they appear. If however, a user
wants to use a zoom or wide angle lens, it is easily done. </p><div>
</div><p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Nite Track is <b>not vulnerable to image bloom and
white out</b> as many image intensification systems are, when subjected to
headlights, street lights etc..</p><div>
</div><p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>In extreme low light or zero light situations,
Nite Track features on-board near infrared illumination that can be switched on
as desired.  This <b>illumination is
essentially invisible to humans and won’t affect ones natural night vision</b> or
interfere with others ability to see.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/984951/files/20141104054713-screen_capture_of_monitor.jpg?1415108833"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><div>
</div><p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Nite Track can be powered from any 12 volt
source and doesn’t require special batteries or chargers. T<b>he Nite Track sensor
will operate on a minimum of 200 milliamps </b>and thus can be mounted on any kind of vehicle with an electrical system. It can also be powered
from standard AA, C or D sized batteries.</p><div>
</div><p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Nite Track does not require permanent
mounting to be used. It can easily be removed or swapped into another vehicle.</p><div>
</div><p><b><u>Why we’re doing
it:</u></b></p><div>
</div><p>There have been many technologies deployed for
years for military and law enforcement organizations that
improve an operator’s night time effectiveness, safety and survivability.  Usually, over a
period of years, these technologies filter down to commercial markets in the form
of surplus, or re-packaged commodities that do not meet the original quality assurances.</p><div>
</div><p>We
believe that if you want an excellent night vision system for a boat
it’s often better to design the system leveraging newer and evolving technologies from
multiple industries and disciplines into a tailored
design. This approach can generate truly
new solutions rather than simply recycling or re-purposing expensive hardware. We
don’t want people to have to strap devices on their heads to see where they’re
going or to spend exorbitantly for a remotely displayed thermal  imaging system.</p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p><b>Near Infrared (IR) Illumination:</b><br/><br/></p><p>Nite Track uses on-board near IR illumination. When switched on, these small illuminators emit a 10 degree beam of IR light that's near the peak spectral response of the CCD chip set. While essentially invisible to humans, the CCD sensor ""see's"" this light much as a human eye will see a spotlight.  This allows a user to illuminate a close in terrain or shoreline feature even in zero light conditions.  Nite Track utilizes two illuminators, one on each side of the CCD sensor. This allows uniform illumination overlaying the lens field of view. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/980160/files/20141102132447-Convergence.jpg?1414963487"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div>
</div><p><b>Low Light Sensitivity:</b></p><div>
</div><p>CCD (Charge Coupled Device) sensors are used in Nite Track. These are inherently low lite sensitive chip sets and widely used in surveillance applications. For Nite Track, the CCD's used are <b><i>far more sensitive</i> </b>than those used in a typical surveillance camera.  This is due to enhanced signal processing capabilities. These capabilities allow a wide dynamic range of exposure control based on ambient light levels and shuttering. This allows for better processing of low contrast environments, such as open water and/or gray horizons.  Terrain features such as grass, dirt, trees, leaves, rocks etc... are also highly reflective of IR  and allow for  highly detailed images. </p><div>
</div><p><b>Lensing: </b><br/></p><div>
</div><p>Nite Track utilizes a 35mm lens.  The lens is an f1.4 HD C-mount lens that allows an operator to view night time images at approximately the same distance as the human eye.  In practical terms, it allows you to see an object well before you run into it.  Objects appear to be approximately as far away as they actually are.  This is very important when navigating at night and you will quickly see why Nite Track instills the confidence it does. <br/></p><div>
</div><p><b>Mounts:</b></p><div>
</div><p>Nite Track units may be mounted with any 1/4-20 mount. A machined mounting plate on the bottom of both Explorer and Ranger is compatible with popular electronics mounts such as RAM etc...<br/></p><b><div> </div></b><p><b><u>How we will use our funding:</u></b></p><div>

Funding will be used for fixtures, fabrication,
component and finishing costs to do an initial low volume production run.<span>  We will also fabricate a mold and other
production related tooling that will allow us an economy of scale for long term
production. We have a solid supply chain in place with all critical components
fully sourced. All CAD files, drawings, schematics are completed. </span>

</div></div>","First, let me
personally thank you for taking time to look at our product page.  Our
team is extremely passionate about Nite Track.  We have no doubt that
given the opportunity to succeed, it will change the way you look at night time
activities.2
Nite Track was created
by a group of four guys who came together through professional affiliations and
friendship. Our technical, market and product expertise is based on years of
technology application and operational experience in various industries.  Our overall goal with Nite Track is to provide outdoor enthusiasts  a great performing, hands free, night vision platform
at an affordable price. 
If you’ve ever walked
through woods at night with a night vision monocular or tried to navigate a
small boat at night while holding a scope to your eye, you will appreciate Nite
Track’s enhanced situational awareness, depth perception and ease of use. 
Operationally, it will bring a high performance night vision system
on par with major marine systems costing over $10,000 at a small fraction of
the price.  Yet, Nite Track is much more adaptive and versatile.
We’ve been
collaborating on Nite Track for over a year and field testing for over six
months. As we’ve built prototypes, gathered data and accumulated results, we’ve
defined a product that meets our specifications for performance, ruggedness,
versatility and reliability.  We humbly yet confidently hope our project
will receive your support and enthusiasm! We know Nite Track is a viable and
innovative product with great potential and with your backing we can begin the
process of bringing it to production.  Please contact us if you have any questions or would like more information by using this email address: nitetrackinfo@gmail.com
So, what is Nite
Track?
Nite Track is a new hands
free night vision product used by outdoor adventurers to safely increase their
activities into the night. Boating, off-road applications, hunting, farming,
ranching and anything else outdoors where being able to comfortably see at
night is important.
Unlike traditional
night vision systems such as hand held image intensifiers (green display) or
Microbolometers (Thermal imaging), Nite Track offers a combination of wide
dynamic range video processing and switchable near infrared illumination. The
result is a hands free crisp black and white video image displayed on an HD
monitor.


These features are particularly important for night time
boating and off road use.  Night
time navigation can be extremely challenging even for the most experienced
operators. Getting lost, running aground or colliding with other objects  is a very real hazard and keeps many people off the water at night and from many other night time activities.  Nite Track
has three main goals;

1. 
To be able to safely, comfortably and
confidently boat at night
2. 
To be widely affordable and simple to install
and use on any boat, vehicle or even structure
3. 
To positively enhance night time recreational
activities for the broadest range of people possible.
Nite Track has several features that differentiate it from
anything else available.
· 
As a hands free system, Nite Track can be remotely placed and remotely viewed on a flat screen display.
Being able to refer to the displayed image as needed, the user doesn’t have
to hassle with mounting head-worn devices or holding a monocular up to their
eye. This greatly improves overall situational awareness and also allows
others nearby to share the image. 



· 
The black/white image allows for great detail,
even ability to read text. Thermal imagers cannot do this nor can they “see”
the stars, moon, clouds, buoy numbers or signs. 
· 
Unlike image intensifiers or thermal imagers,
Nite Track can use any standard video lens desired. The standard lens supplied
is an HD 35mm lens which produces an image approximate to the human eye,
meaning that images are about as far away as they appear. If however, a user
wants to use a zoom or wide angle lens, it is easily done. 
· 
Nite Track is not vulnerable to image bloom and
white out as many image intensification systems are, when subjected to
headlights, street lights etc..
· 
In extreme low light or zero light situations,
Nite Track features on-board near infrared illumination that can be switched on
as desired.  This illumination is
essentially invisible to humans and won’t affect ones natural night vision or
interfere with others ability to see.
· 
Nite Track can be powered from any 12 volt
source and doesn’t require special batteries or chargers. The Nite Track sensor
will operate on a minimum of 200 milliamps and thus can be mounted on any kind of vehicle with an electrical system. It can also be powered
from standard AA, C or D sized batteries.
· 
Nite Track does not require permanent
mounting to be used. It can easily be removed or swapped into another vehicle.
Why we’re doing
it:
There have been many technologies deployed for
years for military and law enforcement organizations that
improve an operator’s night time effectiveness, safety and survivability.  Usually, over a
period of years, these technologies filter down to commercial markets in the form
of surplus, or re-packaged commodities that do not meet the original quality assurances.
We
believe that if you want an excellent night vision system for a boat
it’s often better to design the system leveraging newer and evolving technologies from
multiple industries and disciplines into a tailored
design. This approach can generate truly
new solutions rather than simply recycling or re-purposing expensive hardware. We
don’t want people to have to strap devices on their heads to see where they’re
going or to spend exorbitantly for a remotely displayed thermal  imaging system.

Near Infrared (IR) Illumination:Nite Track uses on-board near IR illumination. When switched on, these small illuminators emit a 10 degree beam of IR light that's near the peak spectral response of the CCD chip set. While essentially invisible to humans, the CCD sensor ""see's"" this light much as a human eye will see a spotlight.  This allows a user to illuminate a close in terrain or shoreline feature even in zero light conditions.  Nite Track utilizes two illuminators, one on each side of the CCD sensor. This allows uniform illumination overlaying the lens field of view. 
Low Light Sensitivity:
CCD (Charge Coupled Device) sensors are used in Nite Track. These are inherently low lite sensitive chip sets and widely used in surveillance applications. For Nite Track, the CCD's used are far more sensitive than those used in a typical surveillance camera.  This is due to enhanced signal processing capabilities. These capabilities allow a wide dynamic range of exposure control based on ambient light levels and shuttering. This allows for better processing of low contrast environments, such as open water and/or gray horizons.  Terrain features such as grass, dirt, trees, leaves, rocks etc... are also highly reflective of IR  and allow for  highly detailed images. 
Lensing: 
Nite Track utilizes a 35mm lens.  The lens is an f1.4 HD C-mount lens that allows an operator to view night time images at approximately the same distance as the human eye.  In practical terms, it allows you to see an object well before you run into it.  Objects appear to be approximately as far away as they actually are.  This is very important when navigating at night and you will quickly see why Nite Track instills the confidence it does. 
Mounts:
Nite Track units may be mounted with any 1/4-20 mount. A machined mounting plate on the bottom of both Explorer and Ranger is compatible with popular electronics mounts such as RAM etc... How we will use our funding:

Funding will be used for fixtures, fabrication,
component and finishing costs to do an initial low volume production run.  We will also fabricate a mold and other
production related tooling that will allow us an economy of scale for long term
production. We have a solid supply chain in place with all critical components
fully sourced. All CAD files, drawings, schematics are completed. 



Stretch Goals

$100,000
Remote Controlled Pan/Tilt

A remote controlled Pan/Tilt OEM module has been sourced that we will integrate  as an added option to Nite Track units.  This will be a single cable integration providing the operator the ability to remotely move the sensor left and right 350 degrees and a tilt angle of 60 degrees.  

$150,000

Wifi Application

This will allow creation of an iPhone/Android application that will provide a real-time wireless connection to your smart phone allowing remote viewing and control of Nite Track.

When Chinese medicine speaks of organs, it refers more to the energetic function of each organ than to anatomy only, as in Western medicine. If a person has a weakness in a certain organ and an imbalance between organs, as part of the treatment protocol, the diet can be modified to reestablish the balance and strength.</p>

<p>Please
 note that this book is designed to help people who are under a health 
professional's care to prepare healthful recipes to assist the patient 
and their treatment plan. There are about 400 pages, without the final 
index included yet. 
</p>
<p> We are looking forward to your help with Volume I's completion so that we can complete Volume 2: Beauty and Longevity. 
Volume
 2 is complete as to the text, recipes and most, but not all, of the 
photography. The index also has to be completed on the book's 285 pages.
 Both of these volumes are  close to being finished and those of us on 
Dr. Hu's team are very excited. Preliminary drafts have been reviewed 
within a close circle and the feedback has been very positive!</p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What We Need to finish the eBook in Phase 1 &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are two-thirds finished at this point:
 the text, layout and design of the book are complete, and is available 
in a Draft version (not for circulation yet) but we need additional 
funds in this Phase 1 towards: </p>
<p> 1.  The completion of the photography and the purchase of copyrights to some necessary photographs. </p>
2.
  Preparing the comprehensive index to label the categories, information
 and recipes (and attach the page numbers) to over 400 pages and about 
300-400 recipes in Volume I. <p></p>
<p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 15.0px 0.0px; line-height: 26.0px; font: 16.0px Times; color: #2a2a2a;"">3. The numerous fees and costs to finalize the editing to prepare the book for publication as an eBook in different usable formats. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 15.0px 0.0px; line-height: 26.0px; font: 16.0px Times; color: #2a2a2a;"">4. Printing a very small initial print run for proofreading purposes to begin preparations for Phase 2 ( a later campaign): printing the hard copy so that the book is available to those people who prefer print. Right now, we are looking at a spiral bound version that will lay flat so that the reader can follow recipes more easily. We are open to suggestions as to later bindings, depending on what we raise in Phase 2 ( or in this Phase 1). The book is written with fairly large type so that people who may be ill or suffering from various conditions can read it with ease. This does make it a larger book, but it also makes it more accessible.</p>

With more funds, we could do more food photography to illustrate the recipes with quality work, and we could move on to Phase 2, printing the hard copies. If enough is is raised, a larger print run for the book can be achieved, bringing the book to more people.</p>

Help us complete the next phase towards publication of this comprehensive book that provides valuable information and recipes that can assist you to support your health with healing foods. Chinese Food Therapy Rx for Self Healing: Volume 1. A Thousand Years of Chinese Medical Wisdom is the second book by Helen H. Hu, OMD, L.Ac.,  a San Diego Doctor of Oriental Medicine and Licensed Acupuncturist. Her first book, Body Without Mystique, helps the reader understand, in layman's terms, Traditional Chinese Medicine, the basis of philosophy and treatments. Now you can finally understand the mysteries of diagnosis and treatment plans that you get from your practitioner!
Dr. Hu's biography: 
She was a medical doctor and a 
cardiologist in China, and was fortunate enough to also study with well 
known Traditional doctors, learning acupuncture and the use of herbs and
 food as medicine. She has been  practicing for over 25 years. Her biography can also be found at: http://www.bodywithoutmystique.com/about-the-author-dr-helen-h/
More about her practice can be found here: http://omdweb.net/



A Little About TCM: 
TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) teaches “food and herbs come from the same source.”  By using natural foods and herbs to balance the body, the body’s energy is restored which is crucial for wellness and longevity.
In our modern society, food and medicine are totally different entities, and nutritional values all point to supplements from vitamin A-Z, protein and fiber contents.  Unfortunately, we use the same modern jargon to classify natural plants and food.  However, we have left out something that doesn’t fit commercial jargon – the real healing power of food.
In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) the three most vital components for life are Jing (physical body), Qi (energy), and Shen (spirit).  These are the so-called “Three Treasures.” A good diet not only nourishes our physical body and our organs, giving us vital energy, but it also nourishes our spirit. When Chinese medicine speaks of organs, it refers more to the energetic function of each organ than to anatomy only, as in Western medicine. If a person has a weakness in a certain organ and an imbalance between organs, as part of the treatment protocol, the diet can be modified to reestablish the balance and strength.
This book provides recipes for treating diseases named as in Western Medicine and different recipes to fit each Pattern Diagnosis by TCM.
     Our goal is to educate and guide our readers to choose the right foods for a nourishing life and for healing. It requires a life time practice to reach our maximum life span (heavenly age). It is called Yang Sheng (Nourishing life).
     Your contribution can help us finish and deliver a helpful book that is easy to read and use and can help you
 with your self healing process. The book has fairly large type and 
large headings and includes the original Chinese brush stroke paintings 
by Dr. Hu as well as well known Chinese brush stroke artist Yue Juan. 
The Draft Contents Pages, without page numbers yet: 





In case the contents page pdfs do not load, the book is divided into
 several sections, with each section describing conditions in both 
Western terminology and with the TCM treatment patterns: How to Use This Book, What
 is TCM Food Therapy, The Healthy Pantry, Food Therapy for Circulatory 
Conditions, Respiratory Disease, Digestive System, Urology Disorders, 
Endocrine Disorders, Neurological and Psychological Disorders, 
Gynecology Disorders, and Auto-Immune Disorders. 


Each section has several subsections, for instance: in the Endocrine Disorders
 section, the book explains the disorder and provides recipes to assist 
people with Hypothyroidism, Hyperthyroidism, Diabetes, Gout and 
Osteoporosis. Each section follows a similar format.

Please
 note that this book is designed to help people who are under a health 
professional's care to prepare healthful recipes to assist the patient 
and their treatment plan. There are about 400 pages, without the final 
index included yet. 

 We are looking forward to your help with Volume I's completion so that we can complete Volume 2: Beauty and Longevity. 
Volume
 2 is complete as to the text, recipes and most, but not all, of the 
photography. The index also has to be completed on the book's 285 pages.
 Both of these volumes are  close to being finished and those of us on 
Dr. Hu's team are very excited. Preliminary drafts have been reviewed 
within a close circle and the feedback has been very positive!

What We Need to finish the eBook in Phase 1 & What You Get
We are two-thirds finished at this point:
 the text, layout and design of the book are complete, and is available 
in a Draft version (not for circulation yet) but we need additional 
funds in this Phase 1 towards: 
 1.  The completion of the photography and the purchase of copyrights to some necessary photographs. 
2.
  Preparing the comprehensive index to label the categories, information
 and recipes (and attach the page numbers) to over 400 pages and about 
300-400 recipes in Volume I. 
3. The numerous fees and costs to finalize the editing to prepare the book for publication as an eBook in different usable formats. 
4. Printing a very small initial print run for proofreading purposes to begin preparations for Phase 2 ( a later campaign): printing the hard copy so that the book is available to those people who prefer print. Right now, we are looking at a spiral bound version that will lay flat so that the reader can follow recipes more easily. We are open to suggestions as to later bindings, depending on what we raise in Phase 2 ( or in this Phase 1). The book is written with fairly large type so that people who may be ill or suffering from various conditions can read it with ease. This does make it a larger book, but it also makes it more accessible.
5. We can make do with about $2,800 in funds, bare bones, but we could use more in this phase. With more funds, we could do more food photography to illustrate the recipes with quality work, and we could move on to Phase 2, printing the hard copies. If enough is is raised, a larger print run for the book can be achieved, bringing the book to more people.
If that goal is not reached, whatever is achieved will be distributed throughout what is needed in Phase 1  in the most practical way. 
If a really substantial  amount is raised, an expanded herbal and food ""pantry"" section could be added to the the ebook and hard copy.
We are projecting completion in about 2 to 3 months, about November 2014, depending on how things go. We are hoping for earlier and are working towards an earlier release date.

Use AMPSound as personal hearing amplifiers, Bluetooth stereo headphones or a Bluetooth earpiece for phone calls. With the ability to enhance sounds, you’ll be able to hear the world around you better than you ever have before. Designed as regular in-ear earbuds, AMPSound headphones are easy to use, easy to wear and require no adjustments to give you the most comfortable fit.








AMPSound offers 16 levels of personalized sound. Whether you’re sitting in the back row at the movies straining to hear or in the middle of a busy coffee shop, you are in control of the noise around you. 





Forget about fidgeting with bulky hearing aids and painful earbuds. AMPSound Bluetooth Hearing Amplifiers are easy to use and easy to wear. Insert one of the three different earbud sizes for a custom fit that feels and looks natural. 



Enjoy high sound quality with or without the boost. To experience the gift of hassle-free, high-quality sound, simply hold down the “Mode” button for approximately two seconds to turn on the amplifier. If you decide you don’t need the amplifying feature, double click the Mode button again to turn it off. 



Enjoy music 24/7 with AMPSound’s compact “Portable Power Pack.” This Portable Power Pack allows for on-the-go charging and uses a built-in 3000 mAh capacity, which provides at least 21 cycles of charging. While you’re at it, feel free to charge your smartphone and other electronic devices with the Power Pack’s USB charging port! 


AMPSound is designed for everyone. Unlike other hearing aids, AMPSound Bluetooth Hearing Amplifiers can be purchased without a medical referral, making them accessible to anyone who wants a little help with their hearing! 
Take your daily phone calls and music streaming to the next level by easily connecting AMPSound to your mobile phone through Bluetooth. Want to jam out to your favorite tunes? Utilize the aptX technology and listen to your favorite songs in high quality.

Your individual talent and vitality and the enthusiasm of a winning crowd are the moving parts of a foundation whose impact is to enhance the health of nations and thus the joy of people.  Your activity inspires like minded enthusiasts to expand our cause.

<p>Two years ago my mother was diagnosed with breat cancer. She eventaullay had to undergo a degrading, horrible, and painful double mastectomy. At that point we thought her cancer was gone or in remission.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A month ago she fainted and lost control of her bowels and bladder. I had her rushed to the hospital. They found her blood levels to be low. She underwent a bone marrow biposy. Another painful thing for her. Well, they found cancer cells in her bone marrow. Which means it metastisized. She saw her oncologist a few days later and more tests were performed. The results of which were that they found the cancer metastisized to her bone marrow, her bones, her liver, her stomach, her chest cavity, and her brain.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They gave her two weeks to live.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This was three weeks ago.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She has declined so rapidly we had to move her to a hospice, because her oncologist said the cancer drugs were no longer working and that she lost the battle.</p>
<p>Her hemotocrit was 18 two weeks ago. It is now 10. She was told any breath could be her last.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>My mother has has a horrible life. In 1984 her husband committed suicide and she found the body, after a shotgun to the head. In 1991 our house burned completely to the ground and I barely escaped alive. In 2008 her dear son Daniel committed suicide. Now she is going to die with only two weeks notice. Her only dying wish is for her daughter to be taken care of, which I will do,She has no living will and no money for inheratince.  but I do not have the resources RIGHT NOW. That's why I need help desperately. Please don't send recommendations to contact civic groups that might help financially because I have looked into EVERYTHING. I have even contacted the media and they could care less. I absolutely HATE asking for money as we have always supported ourselves. But we are a family in desperate need. Please help in any way you can. We (and her) could care less about flowers now and at the funeral, so in lieu of those, please donate. Please pass this on to anyone and everyone. We were supported by my mother and so were her grandchildren. We dont know what to do.</p>
<p>This poor woman has had a terrible life, I just want to her die with dignity, happiness, and to be proud. She is the most wonderful person I have ever known and she will be dearly dealy missed. Please help in any way. If you cannot help, maybe recommend this to someone who can. People donate to charities hand over fist for lesser causes and if anyone deserves help, it's her and our family. 3/5 of our family will now be gone.</p>
<p>Contributions are 501k Tax Deductible (If contributed through paypal) Cedit card payments are not tex deducatble.</p>
<p>Please help in any way you can and also pass this along to as many people as humanly possible.</p></div>","My Mother Suzanne:

<p class=""p3"">Longboards are awesome between point A and point B, but once it is at a stopping point and picked up, it is often a clumsy distraction for both skaters and people nearby. As MIT engineers and longboarders, we want to change that by making a storable compacting longboard, but we need help to fund our project.</p>
<p class=""p4""> </p>
<p class=""p3"">Being President of the Skate and Longboarding Club at MIT, skating is a large part of my life. I take my board everywhere I go: class, flights, on-campus meetings, etc. However it often gets in the way once I arrive to my destination. I cannot lock it away like a bike, nor can I keep it near me without it being an awkward inconvenience or tripping hazard for others around me. Five other MIT engineers and instructors have also recognized this problem and have proposed to find a solution using student labs and machine shops. The goal is to create a longboard that can be stored easily and neatly out of the way, to be as well designed for storage as it is for motion.</p>
<p class=""p1""> </p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p class=""p3"">More convenient transportation is an actual issue, and as the popularity of long boarding continues to grow, this issue will affect more and more people. </p>
<p class=""p3"">If the prototypes prove the endeavor financially promising, the idea may be carried to market independently, or used to gain industry sponsorship and take the project even further.</p>
<p class=""p4""> </p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>What We'll Do</strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">Firstly, your donation wil only be accepted if we reach our minimum goal of $500. Nevertheles, all acquired funds will be put directly towards purchasing raw materials necessary to create proper prototypes. Machining costs will be generously donated by the multiple machine shops and laboratories at MIT. All of us dedicated would like to tackle it with all we can, and with the help of MIT mentors and generous machining and woodshops we will do just that.</p>
<p class=""p3"">Additionally, if we are unable to raise enough funds to reach our posted goal of $500, we will use whatever funds we do collect to begin creating proofs of concept and use those to further attract funds from other sources.</p>
