<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Andnothing is an apparel company that expresses and encourages empathy, human relationships, emotions, and actions. We had our start in late summer of '10 and over the past six months, we have found our inspiration in those around us. We believe in everyone's ability to recognize and embrace human emotions, to show compassion, and to find togetherness in those around you. We're about being a message, not a name.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We strive to empathize and relate on an everyday level. We want to be that constant reminder to anyone who wears our apparel, sees our apparel, or experiences anything we create. We express different messages through our art and offer you the opportunity to express those messages as well. By wearing or supporting our company, you take on the responsibilty to start that conversation, have an open mind, to show compassion, or simply put: Just Love. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>Through your donations you will be giving us the opportunity to expand and move our company beyond just apparel. As designers, Andnothing started as a way of expression for us and we would love to be able to translate our ideas and messages in all forms of art. For the '11 Holiday season we were able to produce personal Andnothing Mugs, and want to continue pushing the boundries of our apparel company.</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>With that, we're starting a project called 'The Empathy Project' where we'll be expressing ideas we believe in through custom screen prints, cards, electronic downloads, posters, words, pictures and everything in between which is due to release at the time of our new apparel line. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>You're donations will help our newest launch, but more importantly, you'll be giving us the means to take Andnothing to a height it hasn't had to opportunity to reach. We'll be able to print on more than t-shirts and expand into cardigans, sweatshirts, crewneck pull overs, beanies, and other means of apparel. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>As of now we're paying with the money our company has been able to make thus far, as well as out of our own pockets. If we don't meet our goal, we'll do the best to our ability to get you the products we want you to have and as much of the products we wish to create. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>As you can see, if all goes well, there are many exciting and one-time-only bundles we are offering for each contribution level! Every dollar counts, and we want to make sure you're getting everything you can for your dollar. </div>

Only what your beard needs.” What does this mean? Uncomplicated, organic, small-batch beard care for beards of all sizes and colors.<br/><br/>Why should you give your beard special care?</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Sensitivity:</strong> Your face is more sensitive than your scalp - and so is your beard. Hair products do more damage than good, as they're made for a different pH level. Beard care products are made to match your skin and beard needs.</li>
<li>
<strong>Itchiness/flakiness: </strong>When growing a beard, you'll probably suffer from itchiness and flakiness. A good beard serum hydrates your beard and the skin beneath, reducing <i>beardruff </i>and any discomfort.</li>
<li>
<strong>Split ends: </strong>Because your beard is exposed to the elements all day long, it may suffer breakage and split-ends. Your beard needs extra nutrients to grow healthy - and that's what a quality beard serum provides.</li>

Septembers get hot here in sunny Portugal, but ""winter was coming"" and a face blanket would come in handy.</p><p>Quickly, he got frustrated by not being able to grow it past the first few weeks (""thanks genetics!"").

Only what your beard needs.” What does this mean? Uncomplicated, organic, small-batch beard care for beards of all sizes and colors.Why should you give your beard special care?

Sensitivity: Your face is more sensitive than your scalp - and so is your beard. Hair products do more damage than good, as they're made for a different pH level. Beard care products are made to match your skin and beard needs.

Itchiness/flakiness: When growing a beard, you'll probably suffer from itchiness and flakiness. A good beard serum hydrates your beard and the skin beneath, reducing beardruff and any discomfort.

Split ends: Because your beard is exposed to the elements all day long, it may suffer breakage and split-ends. Your beard needs extra nutrients to grow healthy - and that's what a quality beard serum provides.
1. Choose a reward level. Choose the perk which you would like to acquire (including the aroma of products) and follow the instructions to check out. IndieGoGo allows you to choose only one reward level at a time. 2. That’s it!If you’ve chosen a ""Barbershop"" or ""Retailer"" perk, you will be contacted via e-mail to ask which aromas you would like after the campaign ends. Everyone will be contacted with their shipping details after the campaign ends.Follow us on Facebook | Instagram | Medium
On a warm September afternoon, almost three years ago, Bruno decided he was going to grow his beard.

<h1>How It Works:</h1>
<p>It works 100% exactly like in the video you just watched. </p>
<p>You simply wear your new Thin Ice Vest and it immediately starts to work - helping you to burn fat and lose weight. Burning an estimated 500 to 1,000 calories a day based on controlled-scientific studies that feature similar features and durations to the recommended use of Thin Ice. </p>

<p><b>Thin Ice is controlled by the super-easy-to-use app </b>. The technology strategically cools parts of the body with high concentrations of thermoreceptors which stimulate the brown adipose tissue (BAT) pathway.</p>
<p>This miraculous pathway burns white fat (bad fat) to produce heat, burning calories in the process!</p>
<p><b>More on the Battery</b></p>
<p>The battery will be located in the arch of the back and is being custom built to accommodate the shape of the average back. This is the best possible area to ensure most size accommodation while maintaining a sleek design under clothing. Here is a cartoon of where the battery is located:</p>
<div data-id=""13052546"">

</figure>
</div>
<p>The battery will be lithium ion and will snap into place on the back of the vest. The battery will be charged on a charging pad in between vest usages. The capacity of the battery is projected to be between 1-4 hours depending on the setting the vest is put on. I.e. lower temperatures sap more battery power than higher ones!</p>
<p>The battery is an important part of this revolutionary technology's ability to keep you cool and help you stimulate brown fat.</p>
<p><b>Brown Fat? Wait a Minute… Surely Fat Something I’m Trying to ‘Get Rid of’ Not Stimulate?</b></p>
<p>Actually the answer is “Yes!” and “No!”</p>
<p><b>Because you see, not all fat cells are created equal. </b></p>
<p>In fact, there 2 major categorizations of fat cells with very different applications:</p>
<div data-id=""12613763"">

</div>
<p><b>- White Fat, the ‘Couch Potatoes’ of the Body</b></p>
<p>White fat is what most of us know the most about and what we are trying to actively get rid of. White fat cells are designed to passively store fatty acids for use as energy in future activities. These cells expend very little energy to subsist, and thus have only few mitochondria which are the engines of the cell world. White fat cells are like the couch potatoes of the body. They sort of just ‘lounge around’ and wait for the body to request their fuel. </p>
<p>The problem with that is that with our sedentary lives, our bodies don’t often need a surplus of fuel and the white fat cells can sit around for years – making YOU fatter and fatter and fatter in the process.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p><b>- Brown Fat</b></p>
<p>Brown fat, also known as brown adipose tissue, is a tissue you probably don’t know as much about as white fat, but you should! </p>
<p>Brown fat cells are a much more active than their white cousins and have a very different function. Instead of passively storing fat, brown adipose tissue’s role in the body is to BURN fatty acids as a fuel source. </p>
<p>In this case, the fat is burnt to create heat which helps to keep the body warm, protecting it from cooling down.</p>
<p>Here is a helpful chart that compares the different kinds of fat cells in our body:</p>

<p>Thin Ice technology might sound too good to be true but we are proud to say its creation has been based on science. The peer-reviewed literature on the ‘Brown adipose tissue pathway and its calorie burning properties’ has guided our every move throughout the entire project. </p>

<h1>Amazing Real-World Examples of the miracle of BAT...</h1>
<p>Besides the scientific articles on the subject matter there are also a tonne of anecdotal examples of the same temperature-related weight-loss effects at play. </p>
<p>One of the most salient examples is that of Michael Phelps’ diet as he trained for the Beijing Olympics. During that time, <b>he ate the 12,000 calories</b> on a daily basis. See his diet pictured below:</p>
<div data-id=""12614233"">

</figure>
</div>
<p><b>FACT: Phelps was able to eat all of that (6 times more than the average person) while staying ripped</b>. Only about half this calorie intake is explainable by his exercise regime and basal metabolic rate. The thousands of missing calories are accounted for by considering Phelps trained in a pool as opposed to land for 4 hours a day.</p>
<p><b>FACT: Water is 42 times more thermally conductive than air is.</b> This means heat was leaving Phelps’ body much faster than it would have if he was on land leading to massive calorie burning to create heat to keep him warm.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p><b>This is the exact same process that is at play with Thin Ice products</b>, albeit without the sogginess!</p>
<p><b>BAT also helps to explain why</b>: People scaling Mt. Everest need to pound back sticks of butter not to die of starvation and why people living in climates with more pronounced seasons (including cold ones) tend to have a slightly easier time keeping off weight.</p>

</div>","THIN ICE: The Most Exciting and Truly Satisfying Thing You’ll Buy All Year Has Just Arrived…
Once or twice in a generation a truly amazing event takes place.

A technological breakthrough takes place that is so different, profound, innovative and truly user-friendly, it is destined to impact literally BILLIONS of lives worldwide.
We’re biased. But with very good reason.
Because we know beyond any shadow of doubt, that the moment you try it, you’ll feel 100% convinced that Thin Ice – the world’s first ‘wearable’ weight loss clothing line, is such a breakthrough.





It has been described as being ‘Like something from a science fiction movie from the 22nd Century’ 
But in this case, while the technology definitely deserves the title ‘space-age’ it is 100% real. And it is available for you to start enjoying today!
This is the Thin Ice Vest 1.0 that had been already developed with your help. Now we have a prototype of Thin Ice Vest 2.0 that is thinner with longer battery life and controlled by an application. 
Thin Ice Vest 1.0:





 Thin Ice Vest 2.0:





You can use the Thin Ice Vest 2.0 anywhere, anytime doing you day-by day stuff including work, sleep, watch TV...





How It Works:
It works 100% exactly like in the video you just watched. 
You simply wear your new Thin Ice Vest and it immediately starts to work - helping you to burn fat and lose weight. Burning an estimated 500 to 1,000 calories a day based on controlled-scientific studies that feature similar features and durations to the recommended use of Thin Ice. 





Thin Ice is controlled by the super-easy-to-use app . The technology strategically cools parts of the body with high concentrations of thermoreceptors which stimulate the brown adipose tissue (BAT) pathway.
This miraculous pathway burns white fat (bad fat) to produce heat, burning calories in the process!
More on the Battery
The battery will be located in the arch of the back and is being custom built to accommodate the shape of the average back. This is the best possible area to ensure most size accommodation while maintaining a sleek design under clothing. Here is a cartoon of where the battery is located:





The battery will be lithium ion and will snap into place on the back of the vest. The battery will be charged on a charging pad in between vest usages. The capacity of the battery is projected to be between 1-4 hours depending on the setting the vest is put on. I.e. lower temperatures sap more battery power than higher ones!
The battery is an important part of this revolutionary technology's ability to keep you cool and help you stimulate brown fat.
Brown Fat? Wait a Minute… Surely Fat Something I’m Trying to ‘Get Rid of’ Not Stimulate?
Actually the answer is “Yes!” and “No!”
Because you see, not all fat cells are created equal. 
In fact, there 2 major categorizations of fat cells with very different applications:





- White Fat, the ‘Couch Potatoes’ of the Body
White fat is what most of us know the most about and what we are trying to actively get rid of. White fat cells are designed to passively store fatty acids for use as energy in future activities. These cells expend very little energy to subsist, and thus have only few mitochondria which are the engines of the cell world. White fat cells are like the couch potatoes of the body. They sort of just ‘lounge around’ and wait for the body to request their fuel. 
The problem with that is that with our sedentary lives, our bodies don’t often need a surplus of fuel and the white fat cells can sit around for years – making YOU fatter and fatter and fatter in the process.





- Brown Fat
Brown fat, also known as brown adipose tissue, is a tissue you probably don’t know as much about as white fat, but you should! 
Brown fat cells are a much more active than their white cousins and have a very different function. Instead of passively storing fat, brown adipose tissue’s role in the body is to BURN fatty acids as a fuel source. 
In this case, the fat is burnt to create heat which helps to keep the body warm, protecting it from cooling down.
Here is a helpful chart that compares the different kinds of fat cells in our body:





Thin Ice technology might sound too good to be true but we are proud to say its creation has been based on science. The peer-reviewed literature on the ‘Brown adipose tissue pathway and its calorie burning properties’ has guided our every move throughout the entire project. 
If you want to look into some of the articles that inspired us and learn more about the fascinating science of the BAT pathway, please check out these articles and publications:

Amazing Real-World Examples of the miracle of BAT...
Besides the scientific articles on the subject matter there are also a tonne of anecdotal examples of the same temperature-related weight-loss effects at play. 
One of the most salient examples is that of Michael Phelps’ diet as he trained for the Beijing Olympics. During that time, he ate the 12,000 calories on a daily basis. See his diet pictured below:





FACT: Phelps was able to eat all of that (6 times more than the average person) while staying ripped. Only about half this calorie intake is explainable by his exercise regime and basal metabolic rate. The thousands of missing calories are accounted for by considering Phelps trained in a pool as opposed to land for 4 hours a day.
FACT: Water is 42 times more thermally conductive than air is. This means heat was leaving Phelps’ body much faster than it would have if he was on land leading to massive calorie burning to create heat to keep him warm.





This is the exact same process that is at play with Thin Ice products, albeit without the sogginess!
BAT also helps to explain why: People scaling Mt. Everest need to pound back sticks of butter not to die of starvation and why people living in climates with more pronounced seasons (including cold ones) tend to have a slightly easier time keeping off weight.
This weight-loss method has been hiding in plain sight throughout our struggles and failed weight-loss attempts. 
Don’t let it sneak away again! Contribute NOW and get your very own 2.0 Thin Ice Vest!





What Do I Get In My Thin Ice System?
Finally, a weight-loss solution that was invented with science in mind. But, you ask, what EXACTLY do I get when contribute for a Thin Ice system? Well, in short, you get an absolute bucket load of seriously amazing stuff!





But don’t take our word for it. Take an in depth look into each amazing part of the 2.0 Thin Ice System:

Instead, what we want to do is make people enjoy interacting with their brush for the first time ever, potentially encouraging them to brush for a little longer, with a little more care and maybe even more often and in different locations. Then, further down the line with people bought into our idea, thanks to our modular design, we will partner with different oral health foundations and dentists to bring more advanced Vibration Modules and replaceable heads and accessories to more drastically increase brushing performance.</span></p>

It’s an
essential part of our daily routine that is overlooked by most. We invest more
than ever in other health gadgets but teeth are ignored, yet damage to teeth is irreversibleNo single brush type, regardless of cost, is best. Dentists simply advise to choose what you feel most comfortable with, that encourages you to brush well, regularly & correctly A modular brush providing a premium experience to all, allowing you to simply & easily adapt its ergonomics, aesthetics, functionality & performance to match your needs & cherish for lifeCreate your own brush, from minimal and manual to flashy and electric
CUSTOMIZE-ABLE HANDLE - aesthetic and ergonomic customization

UPGRADE-ABLE VIBRATION MOTOR - drop in a vibration module to make it electric

RENEWABLE SUBSCRIPTION HEADS - Replacement head mailed every 3 months

VERSATILE CAP - protect bristles while mounted to wall or in bag
Its the start of a platform that can revolutionize the industry. New Ergonomic handles, Smart Vibration Modules & Performance head attachments can keep this brush adapting for yearsResearching with dentists and partnering with a leading brush manufacturer, we bring the same Soft Dupont bristles, Tongue Cleaner & Electric motor used by leading brandsThe basic brush starts at just $19, an electric upgrade adds $20 and head subscription only $4/ cycle, easily competing with manual brush costs and far cheaper than electricsOnly available here, at campaign end we start production. After honing manufacturing & logistics we ship the brush to you, free of charge, summer 2014 (September at latest)To raise funds needed for mass production and learn what our consumers want Instead of losing our vision to investors, you are the investors & get a brush as a thank you!byDEFAULT, a new design brand based in New York, headed by Simon Enever and partnered with other leading Designers, Engineers & Researchers around the worldFor a product so important to our health, that we use twice a day our entire lives, its amazing how little attention we pay to the act of brushing our teeth and the products we buy to do so. Cheap, gimmicky manual brushes and overpriced, overweight electric ones are ubiquitous, whatever the brand and we seem to accept that. But people are starting to care more about the wellness products they buy and we wanted to be the first in the industry to cater to that desire for well designed, intelligent & forward thinking productsThe only consistent thing that dentists agree on is that everyone has different brushing needs and no one brush is best for all, regardless of cost or feature set. Tests have proven that even the most high performance brushes can only increase effectiveness by 7% at most, and can actually be damaging to most if not used correctly. Above all, dentists simply advise to choose a brush that you feel most comfortable with, that will encourage you to brush well, regularly and correctly and that is the core of our thinking A beautifully crafted brush that has had the same attention to detail as our other, less important, everyday objects. Providing an entry point to all budgets, but the same premium brushing experience to all and designed to be kept and adapted for life using a modular construction that allows users to easily adapt its ergonomics, aesthetics, functionality & performance to match their unique needs and keep up with technology
CUSTOMIZEABLE HANDLES - personalized ergonomics and aesthetic
UPGRADEABLE VIBRATION MODULE - manual or electric functionality
RENEWABLE SUBSCRIPTION HEADS - convenient performance
VERSATILE TRAVEL CAP - Hygiene and convenience
Create or choose your own brush to match your unique Aesthetic, Ergonomic and Functional brushing needs. From a minimal and manual brush to a flashy electric oneEvery buyer will receive theDEFAULT brush fully assembled and you can quickly and easily swap in custom handles using the penny slot screw on the base of the brush ""theDEFAULT"" - NO MORE FUSSTacky colors, gimmicky features and clunky construction are replaced with premium design and engineering, ""theDEFAULT"" matte white plastic toothbrush has a beautifully minimal aesthetic and an attention to detail not seen before on a toothbrush""byDEFAULT"" - PREMIUM LIFESTYLETo bring the brush level with our other premium lifestyle products, we created the  ""byDEFAULT"" range of premium handles. Starting with Aluminum and Wood designs, this collection provides consumers with materials and finishes to match their modern lifestyle.""myDEFAULT"" - TOTALLY UNIQUEBy partnering with designers and listening to users we are also building a growing catalog of printed plastic handles in our ""myDEFAULT"" collection. You can choose from numerous colors and unlimited forms, patterns textures and features to match your stylistic, ergonomic or functional needs.Vibrating brushes have grown in popularity but current solutions are bulky and wasteful. By dropping an AAA battery and our vibration module into the handle of your manual DEFAULT brush & tapping the touch sensitive logo, it will transform into an electric one without compromising on size or style. 


Remembering to replace your toothbrush is not easy so we are offering a subscription service that will send you a replacement head at dentist recommended 3 month intervals as a reminder. At only $16 / year ( 4 brush heads), incl. shipping, the cost is well below competitors and on a par with replacing a cheap manual brush every 3 months. The snap on head, containing Soft Nylon bristles and rubber tongue massager, makes replacement quick and easy while reducing toothbrush landfill by up to 80%. Our bundled cap accessory uses an integrated strip of micro suction film to allow mounting of the brush to any smooth surface without residue, providing a convenient, germ free stand when not in use and sealing the brush during travel, keeping the bristles and your bag protected when you to take your brush to work or on vacation



This is the start of a platform that can revolutionize a tired industry. New Ergonomic handle designs, Smart, Connected, Vibration Modules & Unique Performance head attachments can keep this brush adapting for years to comeWhile carrying out research with dentists and being partnered with a certified toothbrush manufacturer from the early stages of the project, we are not creating a brush that tries to make rash claims about brushing performance. Instead, what we want to do is make people enjoy interacting with their brush for the first time ever, potentially encouraging them to brush for a little longer, with a little more care and maybe even more often and in different locations.

<p>Cirri is a startup formed by the 3D technology pioneers going back over 30 years. Most of the 3D scanning technology is based on the Cirri team's developments. Cirri's goal is to make 3D as easy as 2D. Our strategy is based on delivering high
quality, accurate scanning results. We know that you've got to
start with quality. Low quality scans = frustration. High quality scans =
endless possibilities. We can deliver that.</p>

uniform, dense point cloud captures the essential detail needed to use the
model in other applications</span></p>
<p>We’re launching our first Crowd funding campaign to bring you professional grade 3D scanning capabilities. If you
don't know what that means, consider that professional grade 3d scanning tools
can cost from  $15,000 to $30,000 for software, and rising to over
$100,000 for some hardware scanners. Our software provides the same professional
quality results at price points that the rest of us can afford.</p>
<h1><b>What makes a Cirri scanner Unique?</b></h1>
<p>Cirri's technology is better than anything in the market today, including what's used by Microsoft, Apple, Autodesk, 3D Systems or any other. We have lead 3D technology developments for over 30 years. We continue to push all boundaries.</p><p>Unlike any other scanning devices in
the market today that require additional hardware, suffer from poor resolution
outside of a narrow parameter, limited range of subject or object size,
proximity limitations, a large number of photos of the object, poor quality of scan data and no accurate scale; Cirri
combines professional quality scanning results, accurate, to scale, high
resolutions scanning, almost unlimited range of object size or geographic feature, minimal number of photos (2 per visual face) all at a remarkably low price. Cirri is developed and supported by a team of true technological pioneers and visionaries in the realm of 3d scanning. We know what is needed.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/210393/files/20131119180703-Fgallery1-4.jpg?1384913223"" src="""" style=""""/></p>A cathedral scanned, measured and modeled.<p></p>
<h2>
<b style=""font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">How accurate and
how much detail?</b><br/>
</h2>
<p>Cirri scanners can with the proper
setup achieve accuracy of less than one third the thickness of a human hair
with sufficient resolution to capture the shape of the relief on a coin.</p>
<p>Cirri products are based on 3D tools
used today by major video game and movie studios, as well as universities and a
cross section of Fortune 500 companies. The products and their underlying
technology were developed by Cirri’s chief technology advisor and partner, Gary Robertson,
a pioneer in the field of close range photogrammetry. Gary’s ShapeCapture
product suite enables professionals to create point clouds of the highest
quality. Cirri uses a modified scanning engine from ShapeScan to drive results.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/210058/files/20131119160536-Carla2_7.gif?1384905936"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span>Zooming in you can see the uniformity of the point
cloud</span></p>
<h4><b>Point Clouds Rule</b></h4>
<p>Point Clouds form the foundation of
all 3D scanning. They define shape and detail and they look, somewhat, like
Cirrus clouds which is how we chose our name. If you Google point cloud;
passive stereo imaging, photogrammetry, metrology, normal mapping, and cirrus
clouds, you’ll get the gist.</p>

<h2><b>Who is Cirri for?</b></h2>
<p>If you've read this far it's for you!</p>
<p>It would help if you knew a little bit about 3d because it is a bit more involved than clicking a camera shutter. But have no fear our mission is to make it easy. That's why we require funding to create a user interface that walks you through the process. Cirri is for a
professional or anyone demanding professional results with all the demands of perfection. Yet we're going to make it a
tool useful for people (like you) who might be pros or dedicated lovers of 3d or the super interested who want to capture your world without needing a manual. Our point is we intend to make it easy. The long term goal we're striving for is to make 3d modeling of the real world as easy as, well, taking a photo. But that's in the future. Right now we know there's a little more work. So Cirri today is for:</p><p>An animator, artist, modeler, heritage stone works fabricator, designer, studio manager, landscaper, paleontologist, gamer, photographer, sign maker, theme fabricator, entrepreneur, product designer, marketer, producer, fabricator, 3d printer, cnc fabricator or the merely curious. Cirri brings fun and utility dimensionalizing our world. </p><p>Okay more app potentials: You capture 3d models of loved
ones to be treasured forevermore, and don't forget the dog. You're a <span style=""line-height: 1.45em; font-size: 15px;"">geologist, historian, an

<p><b>From Point Cloud to
anywhere...</b></p>
<p>There are literally thousands of uses
for a quality, accurate 3D scan. To that end, we’ll map out paths to go from
the point cloud into an array of applications. Paths to video gaming, movie
animation, 3D printing, CNC cutting, metrology, reverse engineering, mapping,
cataloging, 3D image viewing. We will keep adding new paths and give you the
ability to contribute tutorials and post helpful tips and techniques on our web
forums and user groups.</p><p></p><h1>It sounds too good to be true, </h1><p>and as the saying goes... </p><p>...but in this case it is true. Cirri
is a disruptive product. We know it works because at its working core is the
same software as its more expensive parent that is in use every day around the world. The parent product targets a
different crowd that require huge computing
horsepower. For Cirri we limit calculations to around one million measured points
and provide high, but not subpixel, accuracy. We recognize the world is fast
evolving in 3d where desktop 3d printers, dimensionalized websites and
immersive and personalized video gaming is fast approaching. 3d is stepping out
from the realm of the professional. Not to be boastful but we know our underlying
scanning engine, algorithms and techniques are far ahead of the other
approaches. </p><p>To gain traction 3d has to have a foundation of quality. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The other
approaches that </span><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">sense</i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> 3d or require a </span><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">huge</i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> </span><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">number</i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> of
photos as input, in the end, lead to disappointment and disillusionment. </span></p><p>So we created Cirri, We priced it fairly and we will streamline the user interface so you don’t need to be a
professional to use it – though we hope professionals too will love it.</p><h2>The game plan</h2>
<p>Automate the parameters based on a few simple
input steps. </p>
<p>1.<span>  </span>Tell
Cirri about your camera by inserting a calibration file (which we walk you
through how to make), and choose how many megapixels in the photos. Once this
is setup it can be used over and over, or you could setup several cameras then
choose the camera like you choose a printer.</p>
<p>2.<span>  </span>For
each scan session you take photos of the object you want modelled.</p>
<p>a.<span> 
</span>Enter the approximate distance you are from the object you’re
photographing, </p>
<p>b.<span> 
</span>Choose one of (6) images that most closely represents the scan
ie: trinket, , face, body, wall carving, building, mountain. These choices
automatically establish the initial  scan parameters. </p>
<p>c.<span>  Enter a scale which makes the measurements accurate in real world coordinates</span></p>
<p>d.<span>  C</span>lick to make the model. After partial number crunching
Cirri gives you three preview results. </p>
<p>e.<span> 
</span>You choose what looks like the best result. </p>
<p>f.<span> 
</span>The finished 3d scan emerges</p>
<p>g.<span> 
</span>There may be more tweaking through slide bars and/or another
round of preview images – this will be determined by our beta testers.</p>
<p>h.<span> 
</span>The finish result is a high resolution model created from the photos (including full 360 degrees. As well the photo images are blended and matched to the surface so that it appears as if photographed from one image. </p>
<p>i.<span> 
</span>We’ll have send-direct-to-other-software/utility options, o<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">r the 3d model can just be saved using a number of common 3d
file formats.</span></p>

<b>A real world example</b> </h2><blockquote>If you want to see more please scroll down to the application area further on in this presentation.<span style=""line-height: 1.45em; font-size: 15px;"">Here's an example of the steps to go from - an original carving - to Cirri </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; font-size: 15px;"">scan - to CNC toolpath software - to CNC machine - to finished replicated carving. </span>
</blockquote><p></p><h3><b>CNC fabrication</b></h3><p>Similar to 3D printing, a CNC machine benefits from capturing as much detail as possible in the scan. The limit on a CNC is the diameter of the cutting bit used to route into the material. Fine variations or knife style cuts don't reproduce on the cnc. The exception is if you expand the original scan significantly larger then those details may be utilized. This is common practice in the Theming industry.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/210263/files/20131119172446-1c.jpg?1384910686"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Original Carving - take a couple of photos and load them into the Cirri software<p></p><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; font-size: 15px;""></span></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe border=""0"" height=""326"" src=""https://media.embed.ly/1/frame?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsketchfab.com%2Fshow%2F50b99dba00a0467fb8771e04d954b4ba&amp;width=580&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;height=326&amp;secure=true"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; font-size: 15px;"">Made into a digital model by Cirri Lite</span></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; font-size: 15px;"">Import the model in a CAD/CAM software for CNC machining.

<h2><b>What if I'm an
application developer?</b></h2>
<p>Our industry standard file formats
provide a vast opportunity for application developers and partners to package
up your own solutions. We've established a special reward category just for
you! What that category means is that you'll have an open line to us while
we're evolving the user interface, and you're developing solutions that
leverage our quality point cloud.</p>
<p>We encourage all developers to create
your own apps that adhere to the overriding parameters of quality, intuitive
user interface and an abundance of tutorials. We want users of our tools to
always knows how to get to there from here. You as developers will use the
point cloud in ways we might never have imagined. We will work together to
create an online space to share or sell your applications. We’re itching to
go. </p><h2>Can I OEM Cirri in my own product?</h2><p>Quick answer is yes. OEM arrangements are a negotiated arrangement often involving non-recurring development costs and minimum quantities. We are happy to discuss these arrangements with you. We've opened up a special reward section for companies and individuals called OEM Partners. Our engineering and development resources are limited, so to be fair we allocate resources to OEM partners on a first come basis.</p>

<h1><b>Cirri</b></h1>
<p>The first product from Cirri is based
on our version of a passive image stereo match technology. We call it Cirri after the company name and the cloud formation it resembles.
It’s a fantastic tool that lets you capture textured objects as diverse as
faces, to sculptures, to mountain sides - all using a standard digital camera
or smart phone. We are starting our Crowd funding campaign with pre development completion pricing for
Cirri from $479 up to $599, depending on how soon you sign up. Cirri allows you to scan to very high accuracy
and includes full colour textures and ground based measurement coordinates.
Those coordinates apply an accurate scale to the dimensions which is important
for many applications. </p>
<p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/210383/files/20131119180321-DenverNEWORIN_0_rectified.jpg?1384913001"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Cirri allows you to accurately scan a mountain

<h2><b>Cirri Lite</b></h2>
<p>We will also release a reduced
feature scanner called Cirri Lite. This will still produce the same high
quality point cloud as Cirri but will not have features like scale or
ground base coordinates built into it. The bonus is we can offer it at a much
lower price. Our theory is if you don't need that stuff, why pay for it. We have student pricing available - see the rewards section for how that
works.  </p>
<p>The objective of the campaign funds
are to make the creation of professional grade point clouds accessible to even
casual users. To do this we will create simplified user interfaces for
Cirri and Cirri Lite, training videos, manuals and map out directions to
go from the point cloud to an array of end user applications.  </p>

<p>Our goal is to get Cirri into the hands of early adopters, product development partners and the curious
like you as soon as possible to help us shape product development leading up to
the first release version. We're passionate about 3D. We know that starting
from quality changes the purpose of a scan from a fun, cool gimmicky
thing to a useful tool providing extraordinary utility for a range of
applications. We want partners to create products that use the quality scan as a foundation to their own great products to the benefit of everyone. Indiegogo gives
us access to an extended community that helps us shape the direction and
functionality of Cirri.</p>
<h2><b>Specifications</b></h2>
<h3><b>What Digital
Cameras will work?</b></h3>
<p>Cirri is not specific to any
particular digital camera. Generally the better the camera the better the
result. A two mega pixel camera will provide the minimum resolution. Clear
focus is important. The quality of the camera's sensor is also important. The
digital camera built into the iphone 5S or 5C passes the mark. Here are a
few of the hundreds of cameras that will produce great scans.</p>

<h3><b>Do I need to calibrate the camera?</b></h3><p>Perhaps. It depends on the camera. The scan of the Indian wood carving was created with an uncalibrated Sony NEX camera and it turned out fine. Some digital camera sensors have significant distortion, which affects cirri's ability to create a model. Fortunately these are constants and can be corrected through calibration. It is a simple process and once that calibration is known by cirri you don't have to worry about it.</p><h3><b>Minimum Computer
Spec</b></h3>
<p>Cirri currently functions best on
a minimum Windows 7, 64-bit operating system with 8 Gb RAM and a video card.
 </p>
<p>Don't despair if you don't have that
computer configuration. Cirri can function on a lesser spec,
but you will have some limitations mostly based around resolution, which
affects file size. So you can use a computer with only 4 gig RAM. A lot of us
use the 32-bit Windows version even though 64 bit is available at the same
price. 64-bit did have its issues but since Windows 7 those are mostly resolved
and you do get far more processing activity. We have the capability to create a
32-bit compatible Cirri and will do that if required, so no worries.</p>
<p>We are not Mac compatible but again
that is because we have not had a need to be. We do have the capability to
become Mac compatible if there is sufficient demand. So please let us know.</p>
<p>Like Mac compatibility we also have
the capability to have CIRRI available as a Cloud based application. Lots of
good reasons exist for that to happen, we just need (enough of) you to tell us
that is what you want.</p>
<h3><b>Cirri Scanning
Limitations</b></h3>
<p>Cirri works best for objects with
texture. Texture is best described as non-uniform surfaces with lots of detail.
Look around you. Most items within eyesight have lots of texture and produce
great scans. But not all. Objects like a boat hull or a plain white wall do not
scan well with Cirri.  There are techniques to
help Cirri take measurements but they require additional
steps. </p>
<h1><b>Applications</b></h1>
<p>An application starts from the
Cirri scan, then by combining different components or techniques an
application takes you to a place of new utility or fun. The possibilities are
endless. We've already posted a work flow for CNC applications (see above). This also applies to many applications including set design, theming, architectural features. So let's take a look at some others:</p><h2>3D modeling for Video Games, Movies and Animation</h2><p>A wide array of software is employed to transform a Cirri scan into elements used in video games, animation, movies and other digital art and media. If you're in that world then you are likely already familiar with what you need and what to do. If you're new to this space and want to learn more we will be supporting user forums and support groups to help you go from a cirri scan to whatever you need to do.</p><p>In this section we'll show you screen captures of some of the most popular software that can import a cirri scan directly. Software programs are listed in no particular order. We'll keep adding as we get more screen captures.

<h2><b>Posting 3d images online</b></h2>
<p><b>How a 3d scan is
changed so it can be posted online (Explainer)</b></p>
<p>As you might have
imagined quality 3d scans have lots and lots of data in the form of three
dimensional topology with a photo wrapped overtop. The files are large. Too
large to upload then download in any reasonable time frame. These files are
referred to as being <i>heavy</i>.
The magic with posting online is to make a <i>heavy </i>file <i>light </i>while retaining the visual detail captured from a
high resolution scan. Next is a heavy file made up of 950,000 triangles (Sketchfab does a great job of opening it, but it's still pretty slow). I've zoomed into a portion of the corbel so you can view the triangles. Click on the full model to view in Sketchfab.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/211083/files/20131120035400-950K_triangles.JPG?1384948440"" src="""" style=""width: 568px; height: 246px;""/></p><br/><p></p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe border=""0"" height=""326"" src=""https://media.embed.ly/1/frame?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsketchfab.com%2Fshow%2F3b34916b234d49e4a8648b07fde543a5&amp;width=580&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;height=326&amp;secure=true"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p>3D model above has 950,000 triangles defining the shape. The same 3D model below has been decimated with the normals burned into the texture by our friends at Allegorithmic. It now has only 1,500 triangles. If this were used in a video game that would be further reduced to 10 or 12 triangles, just enough to show dimension but the texture still captures the visual appearance of 950,000 triangles. This is why it's so important to start with quality - high resolution - high accuracy.</p><p>Here's a photo of the object showing the outline of each of the 1500 triangles. Following it is the same image as an interactive model.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/211073/files/20131120034205-1500_triangles.JPG?1384947725"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe border=""0"" height=""326"" src=""https://media.embed.ly/1/frame?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsketchfab.com%2Fshow%2F7b22fb2a17164621a890fe43764f4d6a&amp;width=580&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;height=326&amp;secure=true"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p>To do this you want
to retain the topographical detail (wrinkles and bumps) inherent in a <i>heavy </i>file
yet get rid of file size. And that's just what is done. It's called <i>burning a normal map (or height map)</i>. To understand what a normal map is, you need to
separate a wrinkled surface into two parts. The top part is a photograph. The
second part is the underlying physical shape of that wrinkled surface. A <i>normal </i>is
kind of a third element to all of this. It looks like an arrow and is
positioned perpendicular to the direction of each point on the underlying
shape. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/211088/files/20131120035756-normalVectors.png?1384948676"" src="""" style=""""/></p>A normal map<p></p><p>A <i>normal </i>determines the intensity of the light reflected on
each point on a wrinkle in relation to the direction of the light. A normal
pointing at a light source glows intensely. A normal angled away from the same
light source appears in shadow. As the sun crosses the sky the <i>normals </i>visually
reveal the shape of the wrinkles on the surface of the earth, like a canyon or
a creek bed. N<i>ormals </i>also
reveal the details in a coin or the bush strokes on a painting. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So the magic occurs
when you<i>""burn"" those normals </i>and
forever lock the direction of each arrow without dependency on the underlying
shape. The photo itself now holds the normal. The underlying shape is redundant
and most of it along with most of the <i>weight </i>of the file, can be removed. The detail is retained
the shape is mostly gone so the file very much <i>ighter</i>.
Light enough to post online. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/211089/files/20131120035918-800px-Normal_map_example.png?1384948758"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>Here's another example of the before and
after borrowed from Wikipedia: <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">4
million points reduced to 500 triangles - now you can post it online</span></p>
<p>This illustrates why creating a professional quality 3d scan is
critical to being useful regardless of the minimum allowed file size for
eventual output. Cirri and normal maps are best friends.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2><b>3D Printing</b></h2>
<p>Some 3D printers fabricate only a
shape while others print the shape with a full colour surface (texture). The
resolution of the print can vary considerably from one model to the next.
Cirri can produce all of that. In 3D printing you don't want to reduce the
resolution like you do in a video game. You need the 3D printer to deposit
material in every nook and cranny from the scan so the output represents the
real object. For uses in reverse engineering or product prototyping accuracy of
scale is critically important.</p>
<p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/211091/files/20131120040116-3Dprinting_2.jpg?1384948876"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><span>3D Printed mono-color heads</span></p>

<p>The issue in 3D printing is that the
scan must not have holes along a continuous surface. This is referred to as
being watertight. A 3D printer doesn't like blank areas and a scanner can only
measure what it can see. So there are often inherent blank areas or
""confused"" gaps that prevent a watertight object. We have simple
techniques to deal with that:</p>
<p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/211098/files/20131120040507-geomagicHoleB.jpg?1384949107"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Finding and patching holes to make a watertight

<h2><b>Google Earth </b></h2>
<p>I was explaining Cirri's unique ability to capture 3 dimensional swaths of the earth's
topology to a friend who is an avid mountain climber. She pointed out that Google
Earth already provides terrain dimension information and wondered how
Cirri can improve upon that. Google Earth is an excellent resource but their
sampling rates can vary between about 15 feet up to over 100 feet.</p>
<p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/211096/files/20131120040238-2k2.jpg?1384948958"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Google earth terrain - excellent reference but
needs detail<p></p>
<p>Cirri compliments Google Earth
by overlaying higher resolution, more accurate dimensions and visual detail
within Google Earth. For instance
Cirri can measure the precise pitch of a rock face to within feet or inches;
 the distance from one face to the next; the angle of a ski slope to
negotiate a turn from one gate to another.</p>
<h4><b>Here's how Cirri works within Google Earth.</b></h4>
<p>Using my GPS I can enter real earth
coordinates at a few points on my Cirri scan. Cirri embeds that
information and outputs the scan in a Google Earth friendly format. Now the
scan opens up directly in Google Earth and my scan (of the rock face) shows the
high resolution and accuracy I desired yet still having the perspective of the
rest of Google Earth interface to use as I please. It's an extraordinary tool.</p>

<h2><b>Reverse Engineering, Inspection</b></h2>
<blockquote>I<i>mportant note. Cirri does have scanning limitations (see Limitations section above), and these limitations can be more pronounced in man-made objects that are often the focus of reverse engineering and inspection. Please understand these limitations or contact brad@cirri.co for more information.</i>
</blockquote><p><i><br/></i>An accurate point cloud is an invaluable component of part inspection and reverse engineering. The basic idea of how it works is that a manufactured part that originates from a 3 dimensional CAD design can be inspected using a 3d scanner to measure what was manufactured. The point cloud can then be overlayed on the original CAD model. Deviations from the original model to the real part are calculated and determined if the part is within acceptable tolerances. This requires additional software to perform.</p><p>Here's how that usually looks:</p>
<p><span></span></p><p></p><p></p>

<h2><b>Prosthetic and medical

<h1>Risks and challenges<br/>
</h1>
<p>The risks with completing
our Indiegogo campaign funded project are minimal. The key risk is mitigated
because the underlying scanning software engine already exists and in use
everyday. One hurdle we face is the work required to create a streamlined user
interface for Cirri and Cirri Lite. We are confident that we can do that
owing to our decades of experience creating software products. In addition part
of our development strategy is to seek feedback from the development partners
and beta testing groups that joined us from this campaign.<br/>
We are not relying on any one of us as developers and managers but have split
the work among several people so if something should happen we are not left
without an alternative.<br/>
There is a risk with timeline. However we have managed dozens of software and
hardware development projects over careers that span decades and feel with
confidence that the dates in our production plan are achievable.</p>
<p>So we think we're in a
pretty good position to deliver good on our word.<br/>
This is what we do for our livelihood and it would certainly not be in any of
our interests to deliver on less than our word.</p>

<p></p><p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Here are answers to questions we've been getting.</p><h4>Can you scan hair?</h4><p></p><p>Yes cirri can scan hair, you can see an example of that on our
campaign site. However the hair does end up looking somewhat like a helmet, but
for 3d printing, say, you need that solid structure anyway.  If a human
face is being used in a movie or videogame the hair is usually pulled back so
that an animated hair can be re inserted during animation or special effects
sequences. </p><h4>What happens to the areas that are not seen in the photos - does Cirri leave a hole?</h4><p></p><p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">If you look at the gargoyle  or if you look at the image of the
actor's face, you can see the pair of photos does not cover per say the inside of the nose
on the face. For example you see the left from the left but not the right etc. That does not leave a hole. Cirri fits and fills that occlusion and models it to the surface. Cirri does not need to have a matched pair for all surfaces. It will use coordinate geometry in sync with stereo match photogrammetry. It is one of the methods we employ to reduce the number of photos.</p><p></p><h4>How many photos do you need to create a scale 3d model?</h4><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style='font-family: ""Corbel"",""sans-serif"";'></span></p><p> </p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">You need two overlapping photos per measured view. So
it you can’t see a face then you need to move around an object until you can
see the face. That’s about the best way to figure it out. You don't need to
overlap everything, but you need to see everything you want to model (see
above).

Our Pedigree: The Cirri technology team has been at the forefront of 3D scanning developments for the last 30 yearsDo you know that Cirri co-founder and chief of technology, Gary Robertson, developed the world's most accurate scanner in the early 1980s, with an accuracy of 1 part in 300,000. Then in 1986 developed the worlds first scanner that used photographs to generate the 3d model almost 8 years before the term photogrammetry (using photos to make a 3d model) was even coined. His 67 published and peer reviewed papers have been at the forefront of almost all developments in 3D for over 30 years. That's the pedigree of Cirri.Interactive 3D models: Click on any image with a box in a circle to open a 3D model created by Cirri. When the model opens use your mouse and scroll wheel to interact with it.

your WorldTwo photos of the gargoyle used in the scan. The whole model seen below was captured from 3 pairs of photos.A scan creates digital models from the real world. This scan was captured
by talking two photos of this gargoyle from the sidewalk and turned into a 3d model. How is that possible? Read on. We also have an FAQ section at the bottom of the campaign that answers specific questions we've received. If you're unclear just post a question.Above: The gargolye scan loaded into Lightwave (courtesy of Lightwave)What is our Project?Our project is to create a new 3d scanner based on the smarts underlying the worlds best professional scanning technology. Our project will consolidate the hundreds of parameters used in that technology into a step-by-step, easy to understand process appreciated by both professionals and amateurs to capture the real world in 3D as it actually is. This project will generate two new software based scanning products called Cirri and Cirri Lite, that transform digital photos into 3d models. Cirri provides scale, ground based coordinates and accurate measurements. The Lite version captures the model but without scale and coordinates. Both products will be supported by online training tutorials and teaching manuals - Help is a click away. There is no compromise to quality. Cirri is no gimmick. You will create point clouds of intense beauty, utility or both.Every scan and resulting model shown on the Cirri 3d Scanner Indiegogo campaign, and our website www.cirri.co, were captured with parameter sets that will be automated in the Cirri user interface. The scan results you see in the campaign are the scan results you’ll get from Cirri. (scroll down to: It sounds too good to be true, for more about this and our Game Plan). More questions? There is an FAQ sections at the very end of the presentation.It's all about the Quality
Cirri is a startup formed by the 3D technology pioneers going back over 30 years. Most of the 3D scanning technology is based on the Cirri team's developments. Cirri's goal is to make 3D as easy as 2D. Our strategy is based on delivering high
quality, accurate scanning results. We know that you've got to
start with quality. Low quality scans = frustration. High quality scans =
endless possibilities. We can deliver that.
A
uniform, dense point cloud captures the essential detail needed to use the
model in other applications
We’re launching our first Crowd funding campaign to bring you professional grade 3D scanning capabilities. If you
don't know what that means, consider that professional grade 3d scanning tools
can cost from  $15,000 to $30,000 for software, and rising to over
$100,000 for some hardware scanners. Our software provides the same professional
quality results at price points that the rest of us can afford.
What makes a Cirri scanner Unique?
Cirri's technology is better than anything in the market today, including what's used by Microsoft, Apple, Autodesk, 3D Systems or any other. We have lead 3D technology developments for over 30 years. We continue to push all boundaries.Unlike any other scanning devices in
the market today that require additional hardware, suffer from poor resolution
outside of a narrow parameter, limited range of subject or object size,
proximity limitations, a large number of photos of the object, poor quality of scan data and no accurate scale; Cirri
combines professional quality scanning results, accurate, to scale, high
resolutions scanning, almost unlimited range of object size or geographic feature, minimal number of photos (2 per visual face) all at a remarkably low price. Cirri is developed and supported by a team of true technological pioneers and visionaries in the realm of 3d scanning. We know what is needed.A cathedral scanned, measured and modeled.

How accurate and
how much detail?

Cirri scanners can with the proper
setup achieve accuracy of less than one third the thickness of a human hair
with sufficient resolution to capture the shape of the relief on a coin.
Cirri products are based on 3D tools
used today by major video game and movie studios, as well as universities and a
cross section of Fortune 500 companies. The products and their underlying
technology were developed by Cirri’s chief technology advisor and partner, Gary Robertson,
a pioneer in the field of close range photogrammetry. Gary’s ShapeCapture
product suite enables professionals to create point clouds of the highest
quality. Cirri uses a modified scanning engine from ShapeScan to drive results.Zooming in you can see the uniformity of the point
cloud
Point Clouds Rule
Point Clouds form the foundation of
all 3D scanning. They define shape and detail and they look, somewhat, like
Cirrus clouds which is how we chose our name. If you Google point cloud;
passive stereo imaging, photogrammetry, metrology, normal mapping, and cirrus
clouds, you’ll get the gist.
It's Easier than it Looks
A face captured for a movie - the points are used by animators, not for the Cirri. The full 3d head to the right was captured separately to the actor's face and used as part of a movie's special effects. It allows the actors face to replace that of the stunt person during action sequences (pop goes that bubble).Creating professional grade three
dimensional models can look and feel a little bit daunting, We get it that this
might be all new to you - I'm here to tell you that you don't need to be a
techy or some kind of computer programmer to create everything we're showing
you. You only need a desire to create quality three dimensional models of the
real world - of your world. That's all you need. We'll give you the tools and
training to make it so. So please read on to learn more about what you can do
and how you can help us get you there.From photos to 3d model
Who is Cirri for?
If you've read this far it's for you!
It would help if you knew a little bit about 3d because it is a bit more involved than clicking a camera shutter. But have no fear our mission is to make it easy. That's why we require funding to create a user interface that walks you through the process. Cirri is for a
professional or anyone demanding professional results with all the demands of perfection. Yet we're going to make it a
tool useful for people (like you) who might be pros or dedicated lovers of 3d or the super interested who want to capture your world without needing a manual. Our point is we intend to make it easy. The long term goal we're striving for is to make 3d modeling of the real world as easy as, well, taking a photo. But that's in the future. Right now we know there's a little more work. So Cirri today is for:An animator, artist, modeler, heritage stone works fabricator, designer, studio manager, landscaper, paleontologist, gamer, photographer, sign maker, theme fabricator, entrepreneur, product designer, marketer, producer, fabricator, 3d printer, cnc fabricator or the merely curious. Cirri brings fun and utility dimensionalizing our world. Okay more app potentials: You capture 3d models of loved
ones to be treasured forevermore, and don't forget the dog. You're a geologist, historian, an
architect, archaeologist, anthropologist, a CSI investigator, a prospector, a
developer or a cartographer. You're an athlete finding the edge; a cinematographer enhancing realism or a granite contractor requiring precise dimensions of a building facade -
the list is almost endless. Cirri can take you there on a foundation of quality
and simplicity.Capture highly detailed geometry from the sidewalk
From Point Cloud to
anywhere...
There are literally thousands of uses
for a quality, accurate 3D scan. To that end, we’ll map out paths to go from
the point cloud into an array of applications. Paths to video gaming, movie
animation, 3D printing, CNC cutting, metrology, reverse engineering, mapping,
cataloging, 3D image viewing. We will keep adding new paths and give you the
ability to contribute tutorials and post helpful tips and techniques on our web
forums and user groups.It sounds too good to be true, and as the saying goes... ...but in this case it is true. Cirri
is a disruptive product. We know it works because at its working core is the
same software as its more expensive parent that is in use every day around the world. The parent product targets a
different crowd that require huge computing
horsepower. For Cirri we limit calculations to around one million measured points
and provide high, but not subpixel, accuracy. We recognize the world is fast
evolving in 3d where desktop 3d printers, dimensionalized websites and
immersive and personalized video gaming is fast approaching. 3d is stepping out
from the realm of the professional. Not to be boastful but we know our underlying
scanning engine, algorithms and techniques are far ahead of the other
approaches. To gain traction 3d has to have a foundation of quality. The other
approaches that sense 3d or require a huge number of
photos as input, in the end, lead to disappointment and disillusionment. So we created Cirri, We priced it fairly and we will streamline the user interface so you don’t need to be a
professional to use it – though we hope professionals too will love it.The game plan
Automate the parameters based on a few simple
input steps. 
1.  Tell
Cirri about your camera by inserting a calibration file (which we walk you
through how to make), and choose how many megapixels in the photos. Once this
is setup it can be used over and over, or you could setup several cameras then
choose the camera like you choose a printer.
2.  For
each scan session you take photos of the object you want modelled.
a. 
Enter the approximate distance you are from the object you’re
photographing, 
b. 
Choose one of (6) images that most closely represents the scan
ie: trinket, , face, body, wall carving, building, mountain. These choices
automatically establish the initial  scan parameters. 
c.  Enter a scale which makes the measurements accurate in real world coordinates
d.  Click to make the model. After partial number crunching
Cirri gives you three preview results. 
e. 
You choose what looks like the best result. 
f. 
The finished 3d scan emerges
g. 
There may be more tweaking through slide bars and/or another
round of preview images – this will be determined by our beta testers.
h. 
The finish result is a high resolution model created from the photos (including full 360 degrees. As well the photo images are blended and matched to the surface so that it appears as if photographed from one image. 
i. 
We’ll have send-direct-to-other-software/utility options, or the 3d model can just be saved using a number of common 3d
file formats.
The video below shows the results from scanning a vehicle test track from photos taken from a boom lift 21 feet above the road.
A real world example If you want to see more please scroll down to the application area further on in this presentation.Here's an example of the steps to go from - an original carving - to Cirri scan - to CNC toolpath software - to CNC machine - to finished replicated carving. 
CNC fabricationSimilar to 3D printing, a CNC machine benefits from capturing as much detail as possible in the scan. The limit on a CNC is the diameter of the cutting bit used to route into the material. Fine variations or knife style cuts don't reproduce on the cnc. The exception is if you expand the original scan significantly larger then those details may be utilized. This is common practice in the Theming industry.Original Carving - take a couple of photos and load them into the Cirri softwareMade into a digital model by Cirri LiteImport the model in a CAD/CAM software for CNC machining. In this example I've only chosen the middle section of the carving. In the CNC toolpath software I re-sized the model to fit my material. In this case my material is smaller than the original carving. I also smoothed out some detail as the bit diameter will not pick it up in the carving and the machine runs quicker over a smoother surface.Carving inserted into CAD/CAM software program (Aspire, by Vectric, U.K.)View Simulation of the machine carving to make sure it looks right. Finished CNC simulation in hardwood looks goodRun toolpath on a CNC machine. CNC on the finishing pass of Carving (Intelicam, CNC router)Here's a video showing the finish pass using 3mm ballnose router bit.The finished CNC carving.

What if I'm an
application developer?
Our industry standard file formats
provide a vast opportunity for application developers and partners to package
up your own solutions. We've established a special reward category just for
you! What that category means is that you'll have an open line to us while
we're evolving the user interface, and you're developing solutions that
leverage our quality point cloud.
We encourage all developers to create
your own apps that adhere to the overriding parameters of quality, intuitive
user interface and an abundance of tutorials. We want users of our tools to
always knows how to get to there from here. You as developers will use the
point cloud in ways we might never have imagined. We will work together to
create an online space to share or sell your applications. We’re itching to
go. Can I OEM Cirri in my own product?Quick answer is yes. OEM arrangements are a negotiated arrangement often involving non-recurring development costs and minimum quantities. We are happy to discuss these arrangements with you. We've opened up a special reward section for companies and individuals called OEM Partners. Our engineering and development resources are limited, so to be fair we allocate resources to OEM partners on a first come basis.

Cirri
The first product from Cirri is based
on our version of a passive image stereo match technology. We call it Cirri after the company name and the cloud formation it resembles.
It’s a fantastic tool that lets you capture textured objects as diverse as
faces, to sculptures, to mountain sides - all using a standard digital camera
or smart phone. We are starting our Crowd funding campaign with pre development completion pricing for
Cirri from $479 up to $599, depending on how soon you sign up. Cirri allows you to scan to very high accuracy
and includes full colour textures and ground based measurement coordinates.
Those coordinates apply an accurate scale to the dimensions which is important
for many applications. 
Cirri allows you to accurately scan a mountain

Cirri Lite
We will also release a reduced
feature scanner called Cirri Lite. This will still produce the same high
quality point cloud as Cirri but will not have features like scale or
ground base coordinates built into it. The bonus is we can offer it at a much
lower price. Our theory is if you don't need that stuff, why pay for it. We have student pricing available - see the rewards section for how that
works.  
The objective of the campaign funds
are to make the creation of professional grade point clouds accessible to even
casual users. To do this we will create simplified user interfaces for
Cirri and Cirri Lite, training videos, manuals and map out directions to
go from the point cloud to an array of end user applications.  
Production Plan

Why Indiegogo?
Our goal is to get Cirri into the hands of early adopters, product development partners and the curious
like you as soon as possible to help us shape product development leading up to
the first release version. We're passionate about 3D. We know that starting
from quality changes the purpose of a scan from a fun, cool gimmicky
thing to a useful tool providing extraordinary utility for a range of
applications. We want partners to create products that use the quality scan as a foundation to their own great products to the benefit of everyone. Indiegogo gives
us access to an extended community that helps us shape the direction and
functionality of Cirri.
Specifications
What Digital
Cameras will work?
Cirri is not specific to any
particular digital camera. Generally the better the camera the better the
result. A two mega pixel camera will provide the minimum resolution. Clear
focus is important. The quality of the camera's sensor is also important. The
digital camera built into the iphone 5S or 5C passes the mark. Here are a
few of the hundreds of cameras that will produce great scans.
Many different digital cameras will work fine.
Do I need to calibrate the camera?Perhaps. It depends on the camera. The scan of the Indian wood carving was created with an uncalibrated Sony NEX camera and it turned out fine. Some digital camera sensors have significant distortion, which affects cirri's ability to create a model. Fortunately these are constants and can be corrected through calibration. It is a simple process and once that calibration is known by cirri you don't have to worry about it.Minimum Computer
Spec
Cirri currently functions best on
a minimum Windows 7, 64-bit operating system with 8 Gb RAM and a video card.
 
Don't despair if you don't have that
computer configuration. Cirri can function on a lesser spec,
but you will have some limitations mostly based around resolution, which
affects file size. So you can use a computer with only 4 gig RAM. A lot of us
use the 32-bit Windows version even though 64 bit is available at the same
price. 64-bit did have its issues but since Windows 7 those are mostly resolved
and you do get far more processing activity. We have the capability to create a
32-bit compatible Cirri and will do that if required, so no worries.
We are not Mac compatible but again
that is because we have not had a need to be. We do have the capability to
become Mac compatible if there is sufficient demand. So please let us know.
Like Mac compatibility we also have
the capability to have CIRRI available as a Cloud based application. Lots of
good reasons exist for that to happen, we just need (enough of) you to tell us
that is what you want.
Cirri Scanning
Limitations
Cirri works best for objects with
texture. Texture is best described as non-uniform surfaces with lots of detail.
Look around you. Most items within eyesight have lots of texture and produce
great scans. But not all. Objects like a boat hull or a plain white wall do not
scan well with Cirri.  There are techniques to
help Cirri take measurements but they require additional
steps. 
Applications
An application starts from the
Cirri scan, then by combining different components or techniques an
application takes you to a place of new utility or fun. The possibilities are
endless. We've already posted a work flow for CNC applications (see above). This also applies to many applications including set design, theming, architectural features. So let's take a look at some others:3D modeling for Video Games, Movies and AnimationA wide array of software is employed to transform a Cirri scan into elements used in video games, animation, movies and other digital art and media. If you're in that world then you are likely already familiar with what you need and what to do. If you're new to this space and want to learn more we will be supporting user forums and support groups to help you go from a cirri scan to whatever you need to do.In this section we'll show you screen captures of some of the most popular software that can import a cirri scan directly. Software programs are listed in no particular order. We'll keep adding as we get more screen captures.

Posting 3d images online
How a 3d scan is
changed so it can be posted online (Explainer)
As you might have
imagined quality 3d scans have lots and lots of data in the form of three
dimensional topology with a photo wrapped overtop. The files are large. Too
large to upload then download in any reasonable time frame. These files are
referred to as being heavy.
The magic with posting online is to make a heavy file light while retaining the visual detail captured from a
high resolution scan. Next is a heavy file made up of 950,000 triangles (Sketchfab does a great job of opening it, but it's still pretty slow). I've zoomed into a portion of the corbel so you can view the triangles. Click on the full model to view in Sketchfab.

3D model above has 950,000 triangles defining the shape. The same 3D model below has been decimated with the normals burned into the texture by our friends at Allegorithmic. It now has only 1,500 triangles. If this were used in a video game that would be further reduced to 10 or 12 triangles, just enough to show dimension but the texture still captures the visual appearance of 950,000 triangles. This is why it's so important to start with quality - high resolution - high accuracy.Here's a photo of the object showing the outline of each of the 1500 triangles. Following it is the same image as an interactive model.To do this you want
to retain the topographical detail (wrinkles and bumps) inherent in a heavy file
yet get rid of file size. And that's just what is done. It's called burning a normal map (or height map). To understand what a normal map is, you need to
separate a wrinkled surface into two parts. The top part is a photograph. The
second part is the underlying physical shape of that wrinkled surface. A normal is
kind of a third element to all of this. It looks like an arrow and is
positioned perpendicular to the direction of each point on the underlying
shape. A normal mapA normal determines the intensity of the light reflected on
each point on a wrinkle in relation to the direction of the light. A normal
pointing at a light source glows intensely. A normal angled away from the same
light source appears in shadow. As the sun crosses the sky the normals visually
reveal the shape of the wrinkles on the surface of the earth, like a canyon or
a creek bed. Normals also
reveal the details in a coin or the bush strokes on a painting. 

So the magic occurs
when you""burn"" those normals and
forever lock the direction of each arrow without dependency on the underlying
shape. The photo itself now holds the normal. The underlying shape is redundant
and most of it along with most of the weight of the file, can be removed. The detail is retained
the shape is mostly gone so the file very much ighter.
Light enough to post online. Here's another example of the before and
after borrowed from Wikipedia: 4
million points reduced to 500 triangles - now you can post it online
This illustrates why creating a professional quality 3d scan is
critical to being useful regardless of the minimum allowed file size for
eventual output. Cirri and normal maps are best friends.

3D Printing
Some 3D printers fabricate only a
shape while others print the shape with a full colour surface (texture). The
resolution of the print can vary considerably from one model to the next.
Cirri can produce all of that. In 3D printing you don't want to reduce the
resolution like you do in a video game. You need the 3D printer to deposit
material in every nook and cranny from the scan so the output represents the
real object. For uses in reverse engineering or product prototyping accuracy of
scale is critically important.
3D Printed mono-color heads
Color 3D printed head
The issue in 3D printing is that the
scan must not have holes along a continuous surface. This is referred to as
being watertight. A 3D printer doesn't like blank areas and a scanner can only
measure what it can see. So there are often inherent blank areas or
""confused"" gaps that prevent a watertight object. We have simple
techniques to deal with that:
Finding and patching holes to make a watertight
object
Google Earth 
I was explaining Cirri's unique ability to capture 3 dimensional swaths of the earth's
topology to a friend who is an avid mountain climber. She pointed out that Google
Earth already provides terrain dimension information and wondered how
Cirri can improve upon that. Google Earth is an excellent resource but their
sampling rates can vary between about 15 feet up to over 100 feet.
Google earth terrain - excellent reference but
needs detail
Cirri compliments Google Earth
by overlaying higher resolution, more accurate dimensions and visual detail
within Google Earth. For instance
Cirri can measure the precise pitch of a rock face to within feet or inches;
 the distance from one face to the next; the angle of a ski slope to
negotiate a turn from one gate to another.
Here's how Cirri works within Google Earth.
Using my GPS I can enter real earth
coordinates at a few points on my Cirri scan. Cirri embeds that
information and outputs the scan in a Google Earth friendly format. Now the
scan opens up directly in Google Earth and my scan (of the rock face) shows the
high resolution and accuracy I desired yet still having the perspective of the
rest of Google Earth interface to use as I please. It's an extraordinary tool.

Reverse Engineering, Inspection
Important note. Cirri does have scanning limitations (see Limitations section above), and these limitations can be more pronounced in man-made objects that are often the focus of reverse engineering and inspection. Please understand these limitations or contact brad@cirri.co for more information.
An accurate point cloud is an invaluable component of part inspection and reverse engineering. The basic idea of how it works is that a manufactured part that originates from a 3 dimensional CAD design can be inspected using a 3d scanner to measure what was manufactured. The point cloud can then be overlayed on the original CAD model. Deviations from the original model to the real part are calculated and determined if the part is within acceptable tolerances. This requires additional software to perform.Here's how that usually looks:

The scan data is combined with the original CAD
Prosthetic and medical
devices
Cirri captures the complex shape
of the human body which makes it a useful tool for designing a prosthetic, as
illustrated in the following examples (note these prosthetics did not originate
from a Cirri scan and are for illustration purposes):
Underlying
scan geometry of the hand was used to create prosthetic
A precise scan of the limb is used to model an
optimal fit.
Risks and challenges

The risks with completing
our Indiegogo campaign funded project are minimal. The key risk is mitigated
because the underlying scanning software engine already exists and in use
everyday. One hurdle we face is the work required to create a streamlined user
interface for Cirri and Cirri Lite. We are confident that we can do that
owing to our decades of experience creating software products. In addition part
of our development strategy is to seek feedback from the development partners
and beta testing groups that joined us from this campaign.
We are not relying on any one of us as developers and managers but have split
the work among several people so if something should happen we are not left
without an alternative.
There is a risk with timeline. However we have managed dozens of software and
hardware development projects over careers that span decades and feel with
confidence that the dates in our production plan are achievable.
So we think we're in a
pretty good position to deliver good on our word.
This is what we do for our livelihood and it would certainly not be in any of
our interests to deliver on less than our word.

Here are answers to questions we've been getting.Can you scan hair?Yes cirri can scan hair, you can see an example of that on our
campaign site. However the hair does end up looking somewhat like a helmet, but
for 3d printing, say, you need that solid structure anyway.  If a human
face is being used in a movie or videogame the hair is usually pulled back so
that an animated hair can be re inserted during animation or special effects
sequences. What happens to the areas that are not seen in the photos - does Cirri leave a hole?If you look at the gargoyle  or if you look at the image of the
actor's face, you can see the pair of photos does not cover per say the inside of the nose
on the face. For example you see the left from the left but not the right etc. That does not leave a hole. Cirri fits and fills that occlusion and models it to the surface. Cirri does not need to have a matched pair for all surfaces. It will use coordinate geometry in sync with stereo match photogrammetry. It is one of the methods we employ to reduce the number of photos.How many photos do you need to create a scale 3d model? You need two overlapping photos per measured view. So
it you can’t see a face then you need to move around an object until you can
see the face. That’s about the best way to figure it out. You don't need to
overlap everything, but you need to see everything you want to model (see
above). Generally you can capture 360 degrees in about 7 or 8 photo pairs.  Can I scan an airplane?An airplane starts to
fall within the limitations as the software, which requires texture
(variability of the surface), and this is not typical of an airplaneWhat differentiates you from 123D?The 123D algorithm is based on an open source freeware and requires a large number of photos and hence
significant computing power to create anything. Cirri requires 2
photos per viewable face and can fill in the rest. In addition our point cloud generation is more
even/regular hence more usable (a prerequisite part of making it easy). The Cirri output has a very clean, dense point cloud which you control - quality is key. Cirri has ground based coordinates. Lastly you can own cirri and the 3d models you create without uploading anything. Can you do 3d capture from video?Yes provided each video image meets our minimum recommended spec (2Mp).How do I know I'll be chosen to be a beta tester?The first 100 people who sign up as beta testers are accepted. After that it is closed. Please go to the Perks contribute section (right side column) to sign up.Which CNC machines will your software support?Cirri can output an stl file format into a CNC machine's CADCAM software. The CADCAM software is what drives your machine. Stl (stereo lithography) is the most common 3d mesh type of file used in CNC machining. That is the file output I used on the example of carving the Indian carving scan in this campaign. For that example I used Vectric's Aspire. Many of the most common CADCAM software can open, manipulate and toolpath a 3d mesh based file. Popular CADCAM software that comes to mind are ArtCam, Type 3, MasterCam, RhinoCam, MeshCam, FreeMill, Deskproto, PowerMill and many more that work, Rhino3D has an excellent resource page on their website. All of those softwares can load a 3d mesh model, toolpath, generate an NC code and drive your machine. This means that Cirri (indirectly) supports any CNC machine that accepts G-code from these softwares (which is pretty much all CNCs).",45.0,9,"1 Campaign

diseñadora & Gloria Bendita

Magdalena
Brasa, apasionada por la moda, comenzó su andadura en el sector
textil en el año 1984 en
Ibiza.
 


Tras
años de experiencia colaborando con varias marcas de la isla, la
diseñadora indagó y puso en cuestión algunos de los procesos de
fabricación textil que las industrias llevaban a cabo, hasta poner
en marcha en el año 2000 un proyecto personal en búsqueda de un
verdadero cambio en la sociedad y el medio ambiente: Gloria Bendita.
Moda ética y sostenible. Años más tarde el proyecto trasladó
su filosofía hasta Andalucía, donde actualmente reside y cuenta con
buena acogida.
www.gloriabendita.es



Nuestros
importantes objetivos

Queremos
llegar a un público final, preocupado por el futuro de la sociedad y
el medio ambiente, así como la ropa que viste, su procedencia y su
método de elaboración.

Apostamos
por la creación de ropa a base de materiales naturales y ecológicos
como la lana, que sin perder atractivo en diseño sean respetuosos
con el medio ambiente, las personas que intervienen en su proceso de
creación y el consumidor final.

Como
no sólo queremos un cambio medioambiental sino también social,
desde el nacimiento de la marca apostamos por la mano de obra
artesana y por tanto por la inserción laboral de familias españolas.



Es
por ello que nuestras prendas de lana son elaboradas por mujeres
andaluzas de familias en riesgo de exclusión socio-laboral,
pertenecientes a la Asociación
Sevillana de Tejedoras “Con nuestras manos”.



Por
y para todo lo anterior queremos relanzar la marca presentando la
nueva colección femenina “Flowers”,
que inspirada principalmente en las mujeres pretende defender la
dignidad de ellas en el entorno socio-laboral.

El
nombre
'Flowers'
nace bajo el pensamiento
""cada
flor es una mujer y hay que regarla para que crezca"".
Por tanto, parte
del dinero con el que adquieres nuestras prendas irá destinado a
integrar, formar y dar empleo a mujeres en riesgo de exclusión y por
tanto a mejorar la situación social y alimentaria de muchas familias
españolas que rozan el umbral de pobreza. 


Trabajamos con materiales naturales y orgánicos como la Lana

<h4><b><b>SHORT SUMMARY</b></b></h4><b>
</b><p>Andrea Piñeros and Paula Gamboa have been best friends since their
teens. With over 30 years of experience between them in fashion, design, and
business, they are working together to solve a problem that hits close to home!
2 out of 3 women in the Latin-American population alone are Curvy. But the
lingerie choices available come in two sizes - thin and thinner! With fashion
forward designs and beautiful fabrics, Bodicelli is bringing the plus size
revolution to women that need it most! </p>
<p></p>
<p><b><i>RESEÑA BREVE</i></b></p>
<p><i>Andrea Piñeros y Paula Gamboa son amigas desde el colegio, entre ellas
hay más de 30 años de experiencia en moda, diseño y negocios. Ellas están trabajando
para resolver un problema cercano a su corazón, ya que 2 de cada 3 mujeres
latinoamericanas son Curvy. Lamentablemente en la industria de la ropa interior
solo se ofrecen 2 tallas, pequeña y más pequeña. Con diseños modernos y
vanguardistas, con telas suaves y hermosas, Bodicelli está revolucionando el mercado
de las mujeres que más lo necesitan… las Curvy!</i><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></b></p><p style=""display: inline !important;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1064796/files/20141202073751-founders.png?1417534671"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/></p><p><b>WHAT WE NEED</b></p>

 importance of recycling textiles is increasingly being recognized. Over
 80 billion garments are produced annually, worldwide. In 2010, about 
five percent of the U.S. municipal waste stream was textile scrap, 
totaling 13.1 million tons. The recovery rate for textiles is still only
 15 percent. </p><p>In Canada, for example, over $30 billion is 
spent on new clothing each year, translating to approximately 1.13 
billion garments, and with an average growth rate of 5.16 percent per 
year. On average, Canadians discard seven kilograms (over 15 lbs.) of 
clothing per capita each year. </p><p>Textiles constitute five 
percent of municipal solid waste by weight. As such, they, along with 
other segments of the solid waste stream such as organics are a 
significant segment to be addressed as we strive to move closer to a 
zero landfill society.</p><p>Natural fibers can take hundreds of 
years to decompose, and once in the landfill may release methane and CO2
 gas.into the atmosphere. The even more durable textiles manufactured 
from synthetics are designed not to decompose. In the landfill they may 
release toxic substances into groundwater and surrounding soil. </p><p>During
 production, synthetics release nitrous oxide, which is a much more 
powerful greenhouse gas than CO2, absorbing as much as 270 times more 
heat. <br/><br/>source:  <a href=""http://recycling.about.com/od/Glossary/a/About-Textile-Recycling.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://recycling.about.com/od/Glossary/a/About-Textile-Recycling.htm</a></p><p></p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/492329/files/20140408031026-allies.jpg?1396951826"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/495705/files/20140409073908-sample1.jpg?1397054348"" src="""" style=""""/></p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><p></p><h2>Company Background...<br/>

Founded in the Year 2013, Havrilla Heavy Denim is a small family business, located
in Riemerling, on the southern outskirts of Munich, Germany.  We manufacture Bags and Home-Accessories,
made from 100% Recycled Denim. All of our products are Handmade and Made In
Germany. Each denim-bag takes 6 labor
hours, 700 meters of thread, 2-6 denims of different strength and a variety of
accessories to design and produce the perfect finished product.  Each product is unique in its design and a
one of a kind piece.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Why Recycled Denim?

Each
year, tons of newly produced and unused textiles are thrown away by the
industry worldwide.  My company not
only  produces stylish Bags and Home-Accessories
made from 100% Recycled Denim, but we are committed to doing our part in
establishing a sustainable future.  Although the idea of recycling in not new, we have created a unique
Recycling-Process using Denim. Each
pair of jeans we recycle, is one less thrown away.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Here are some facts found on the internet:The
 importance of recycling textiles is increasingly being recognized. Over
 80 billion garments are produced annually, worldwide. In 2010, about 
five percent of the U.S. municipal waste stream was textile scrap, 
totaling 13.1 million tons. The recovery rate for textiles is still only
 15 percent. In Canada, for example, over $30 billion is 
spent on new clothing each year, translating to approximately 1.13 
billion garments, and with an average growth rate of 5.16 percent per 
year. On average, Canadians discard seven kilograms (over 15 lbs.) of 
clothing per capita each year. Textiles constitute five 
percent of municipal solid waste by weight. As such, they, along with 
other segments of the solid waste stream such as organics are a 
significant segment to be addressed as we strive to move closer to a 
zero landfill society.Natural fibers can take hundreds of 
years to decompose, and once in the landfill may release methane and CO2
 gas.into the atmosphere. The even more durable textiles manufactured 
from synthetics are designed not to decompose. In the landfill they may 
release toxic substances into groundwater and surrounding soil. During
 production, synthetics release nitrous oxide, which is a much more 
powerful greenhouse gas than CO2, absorbing as much as 270 times more 
heat. source:  http://recycling.about.com/od/Glossary/a/About-Textile-Recycling.htm------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Company Background...

The last
8 months we were busy developing a collection of bags with different
styles, in various sizes that were easy to handle and had lots of room. We made sure to include lots of pockets in
both our men’s and women’s line. 
We sent
our bags out to be enjoyed by various people in all walks of life and feedback
was extremely positive. We compiled the data and used the input to revise our
original product to better meet consumer preferences. You can see these
upgrades here on our homepage: http://www.havrillaheavydenim.com


Until
this point, we have used private funding to purchase machinery, textiles,
parts, and to create our site. The structure of our company is now in place and
Havrilla Heavy Denim is good to go.
Our partners include...
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Perks!We need your help...
To set up
the next generation of Bags we need to upgrade all our machinery. Thus far, we
have been able to create our bags on sewing machines made for home use.  With our new design, it has become
increasingly difficult to handle 6 layers of denim on our current
machines.  It is time to put some power
behind our product to be able to handle the expected demand.  
Help us
power up to go on.

My name is Donna Ponessa. I am one of the top five ranked Para-dressage riders in the US and I am vying to make the US team for the 2012 Paralympics in London this summer.  I have a rare form of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) called Deviac’s disease and am paralyzed from the chest down and need the assistance of a ventilator to breathe.  In order to finish out the season training and competing to make the US Team selection trials in June, I need to raise funds.
 
I began showing horses when I was a child, but as the disease progressed, I had to stop riding and sell my beloved horse. My desire to be involved with horses again never wavered, so in 2007, after stabilizing the MS, I began riding again and immersed myself in the art of dressage.
 
Exploring how to achieve the highest level of the sport, I attended a Para-Equestrian training camp in California, where I was told I had the raw talent to become a leading Para-Equestrian contender at the 2012 Paralympic Games in London.
 
In May 2011, I began working with Wes Dunham of Woodstock Stables in Millbrook, NY and after being internationally certified a Grade 1a Para-Equestrian by the Fédération Equestre Internationale (FEI) – the class for the most severely impaired riders – I have since garnered these wins:
 

Grand Champion and Reserve Grand Champion at the USEF Para-Equestrian Dressage National Championship at the NEDA Fall Festival in Saugerties, NY Sept. 2011

Selected among eight riders to attend the prestigious Robert Dover Para-Dressage Clinic at the U.S. Equestrian Team Foundation (USET) center in Gladstone, NJ Nov. 2011

Chosen by the USEF High Performance Para Equestrian Selection Committee to compete in Mexico City, Mexico Nov. 2011 and scored gold in all three competitions: Freestyle, Individual, and Team*

Chosen by the USEF High Performance Para Equestrian Selection Committee to compete in Werribee, Australia Dec. 2011 and scored gold in all three competitions: Freestyle, Individual, and Team*
         *Both of these performances helped bring the US Team Gold medals. 
 
Today I work fulltime as program manager for the Westchester/Putnam Independent Living Center.  In addition to my daily dressage training, I am in the gym early every morning working out in order to stay strong. 
 
The Impact
My disability has taught me to live day-by-day, and learn how each day presents a clean slate.  Despite this progressive disability, I am relentlessly driven to make the most of my life.  I refuse to be defined or limited by my disability.  I hope that my determination and drive will help and inspire other Para-athletes to reach the highest echelon in their sports.
 
While it would be the ultimate honor and privilege to be a medal contender for and represent the United States at the next Paralympic Games, I realize that due to a lack of funding I might not be able to continue training or even be able to afford to ship my horse to London.  Please know that every dollar donated goes towards my goal of bringing home the gold medal for the US Team.
 
The Campaign
I need to raise funds to help defray costs such as training, horse maintenance (vet bills) and general upkeep (hay, feed, vitamins); horse show fees; travel and accommodations to and from the shows (for both humans and horses!); plus coaching, maintenance and equipment.

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Transitioning to a plant-based lifestyle, we found that one of the biggest hurdles was getting dressed for the office. Business wear for men typically includes leather, wool, silk, and other animal-derived fabrics. Not wanting to contribute to animal suffering, we researched and learned about a supply chain where human and animal suffering are a standard part of business.</p>
<p>Resolving to fix this, we partnered with a fair labor factory to create a briefcase. And with that, a vision was born.</p>
<p>Your contribution doesn't go to a briefcase. This briefcase is just the start. Our vision is a full menswear line which leaves you confident and comfortable that you not only look great, but your choices contribute to a better world.</p>
<p>Our products are made free of animal testing, animal-derived ingredients, and unethical labor practices. And they always will be.</p>

</div></div>","The Story
Transitioning to a plant-based lifestyle, we found that one of the biggest hurdles was getting dressed for the office. Business wear for men typically includes leather, wool, silk, and other animal-derived fabrics. Not wanting to contribute to animal suffering, we researched and learned about a supply chain where human and animal suffering are a standard part of business.
Resolving to fix this, we partnered with a fair labor factory to create a briefcase. And with that, a vision was born.
Your contribution doesn't go to a briefcase. This briefcase is just the start. Our vision is a full menswear line which leaves you confident and comfortable that you not only look great, but your choices contribute to a better world.
Our products are made free of animal testing, animal-derived ingredients, and unethical labor practices. And they always will be.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is James. I was born and raised in Montreal and have worked in men’s fashion for the better part of 20 years. Rich in art and design, the city has provided a sense of architectural beauty and a population of fashion forward thinkers. The 4 seasons in this city are drastically different with very wet falls and springs, hot summers and snowy winters. Making snowmen, skiing and sipping whisky in the winters are loads of fun but we also face a multitude of challenges, such as icy sidewalks and knee high snow banks. Proper winter boots are a must! However, wearing bulky, heavy and sometimes uncomfortable winter boots are a nuisance. I wanted to create something that would both fuse style and functionality where someone could not only feel safer walking on treacherous terrain but look good doing it. If we can attain our campaign goal, it will effectively launch the product and facilitate the production of our first lot to be delivered to our contributors and initial retail sales channels. From there, we would like to add to our product line in terms of offering new color ways and even printed styles.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our campaign goal is $100,000. </p>
<p>This will finance the creation of the moulds and the production of the first lot of galoshes. </p>
<p>As a contributor, you will receive a pair of Kraken galoshes at a fraction of the retail cost and be the first to showcase these stylish accessories. </p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal, we will evaluate if the project can still be launched. This would all depend of course on the total funds raised.  If we deem that it will not be feasible, then we will reimburse the amount. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As a contributor you will help create a unique product that provides a fine balance between functionality and style. In Montreal alone, we have thousands of cases of injuries due to icy conditions every winter. We truly believe that our galoshes will help prevent those nasty falls. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We appreciate all contributions no matter how big or small because you are helping us achieve our dream by bringing a well made and thoughful product to the market. Can't contribute, no problem, you can help us get the word out. Share our indiegogo, facebook, instagram pages, sign up to our newsletter so we can keep you updated, get people engaged and help us Unleash the Kraken!</p>

We use ""womxn"" because we fully agree and wholeheartedly support how ""‘womxn’...stress[es] the concept that womxn are their own separate individuals, capable, operational on their own, and without a man to help them.

<h3>A Note from Our Founder and Designer</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Jene' Jackson. I'm an <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Oat-Project-Faced-Finally-Summer/dp/0997925108"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">author</a>, <a href=""https://jenejackson.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">speaker</a>, and long-time passionate amateur <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/spiralspiral/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">photographer </a>and now, designer! I see the world in terms of light and shadow...<i>drama</i>. And I love seeing how people express themselves through clothing. Though I don't play well with sewing machines, I still have a portfolio full of designs sketched in high school in a box somewhere.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1601646477/riuajgusjo9xe5236veq.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>When I lost my job due to COVID-19, as many of us did, I decided it was time to unite my passions to design products that express confidence in womxnhood and beauty, using my photography as the raw material. I've been dreaming and planning a store to share with the world for years, working on the YoniFlower concept for over a year, and now, I'm building it for real.</p>
<p>I'm a creative. I have more books to write, more <a href=""https://churchofwild.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">thoughts to share</a>, more <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7VXgO3PVpCsdKeINOuwWKA/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">stories to tell</a>. Those will come. But with YoniFlower and the <a href=""http://churchofwild.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Church of Wild</a> Collections store, I hope to make our world a brighter, lovelier, cheekier place, to galvanize and encourage confidence in womxn's lives, to more fully support our community, and to rile up a lot of fun!</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>What Your Backing Means &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The goal for this first YoniFlower launch is $10,000. We see that number in terms of impact. <strong>$10K equals a little over 130 pairs of YoniFlower leggings running around out in our world, proclaiming strength, sass, and confidence in womxnhood!</strong></p>
<p>Raised funds will go towards producing your perks, design tools, creating long-term marketing with respected systems, and building out YoniFlowers' home, the Church of Wild Collections online store. Getting each design just right takes much longer than you might imagine; they're not just slapped on. If this campaign doesn't meet the goal, every penny raised will still help strengthen the store and scale up faster.</p>
<p><strong>You will be our first round of customers! Your experience with YoniFlower leggings matters and will inform next steps.</strong></p>
<p>This flagship collection is only the beginning. You can look forward to new YoniFlower designs when the Church of Wild Collections store launches, as well as matching sports bras, masks, and sweatpants, botanical prints that are a little less in-your-face but just as striking, and designs using Jene's photography of plants, abstract/urban, and patterns, and more. We can't <i>wait </i>to release collection after collection based on seasons, themes, always with new photos and fascinating vistas!</p>

<h3>Giving Back</h3>
<p>We are thrilled to support our local community with the YoniFlower line. 10% of what the campaign makes and of the YoniFlower line, when the online store opens, will be donated to organizations and endeavors that support womxn of color and promote safety and life.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What are ""Meggings"" and Why Do We Offer Them?</h3>
<p>We believe even men have at least a bit of the yoni in their nature. The Church of Wild Collections store will eventually offer an entire men's line, but we know men who will want to celebrate their yoni-ness and show solidarity with womxn by wearing YoniFlower ""meggings.""</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>DESIGN: We are already working with our production teams to make sure what you see in the product mockups is what ends up in your hands. For example, as the sizes increase, more of the printed material is sewn together in the yoni area. You wouldn't want a YoniFlower with <i>two</i> flower centers ""right there."" So we're working to mitigate that through trial and error and ordering samples, then more design.</p>
<p>COVID-19: Our production partners have been practicing vigilant protection measures at their factories, hiring and ramping up operations to meet increased demand, and are doing all they can to prevent delivery delays. We will let you know immediately if there is any change in expected delivery times.</p>
<p>From Jene': At the beginning of the 2020 pandemic, in March, I was preparing to launch...wait for it...a travel retreat company. TRAVEL. As the world shut down and we all found new ways to work and be in community, I had to shift.</p>
<p>YoniFlower is my shift. And though I could shift again, the words <strong>""grit,"" ""hustle,"" and ""determination""</strong> come to mind. I'm <i>not </i>going to stop making this audacious YoniFlower vision real, as long as one person wants these, I will make them.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>You Can Help in Many Ways</h3>
<p>If funds are tight right now, we hear you, so dang much. Take advantage of the Early Bird perks, find a way to save up for your favorites, and stay tuned for occasional flash sales when the store opens. The everyday self care of what we wear is worth it when it brings a smile and sass, in the YoniFlower spirit. We honor you.</p>
<p>For now, you can help by getting the word out and making some noise about this campaign and the spirit of YoniFlower. Share, share, share!</p>

A Note from Our Founder and Designer
Hi! My name is Jene' Jackson. I'm an author, speaker, and long-time passionate amateur photographer and now, designer! I see the world in terms of light and shadow...drama. And I love seeing how people express themselves through clothing. Though I don't play well with sewing machines, I still have a portfolio full of designs sketched in high school in a box somewhere.

When I lost my job due to COVID-19, as many of us did, I decided it was time to unite my passions to design products that express confidence in womxnhood and beauty, using my photography as the raw material. I've been dreaming and planning a store to share with the world for years, working on the YoniFlower concept for over a year, and now, I'm building it for real.
I'm a creative. I have more books to write, more thoughts to share, more stories to tell. Those will come. But with YoniFlower and the Church of Wild Collections store, I hope to make our world a brighter, lovelier, cheekier place, to galvanize and encourage confidence in womxn's lives, to more fully support our community, and to rile up a lot of fun!

 
What Your Backing Means & What You Get

YoniFlower is my shift. And though I could shift again, the words ""grit,"" ""hustle,"" and ""determination"" come to mind. I'm not going to stop making this audacious YoniFlower vision real, as long as one person wants these, I will make them.

The fulfilment and effectiveness of this new program highly boost our confidence in Flowtime.
Designs and working prototypes have been developed. We are going to do small-batch production soon. Based on our experience of production and distribution worldwide with our last two crowdfunding campaign, we are confident that we will be able to produce the final product with exceptional quality and to also complete it on time.",42.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<p>Hello, I'm Sailor! During the peak of the Naruto fandom years back, I was quite into NaruSasu and practically gobbled up any content I could get my hands on. I wasn't all that confident with my art then though and never contributed content myself. Now that I've returned to the fandom and have gotten a lot better and more confident in my skills as an artist, it's high time to finally churn out some NaruSasus that fellow shippers could enjoy!</p>

<p>Since Indiegogo projects can't be backed through paypal, I'll also open paypal orders in my online shop for a limited time when the project reaches the minimum funding goal ($500). During that period, customers can avail of the perks below for the same price as Indiegogo backers. The period for paypal purchases will last two weeks, the same amount of time this Indiegogo campaign will run.</p>

It's much more resilient that normal leather, it's all natural, eco friendly and really smells good too.

To release the belt, pull the end that pokes out of the buckle whilst pushing the buckle release knob and push the belt back through the buckle. Once you’ve done it a couple of times it becomes second nature. When you get the belt, the leather part is long enough to fit the widest waist (within reason). Wrap the belt around you and cut to length so what the middle of the ratchet on the front end of the belt meets the cut end of the belt. Best to cut longer and then fit the buckle. You can always trim a bit more so that it eventually it is cut to your size. There is a small cream leaflet that comes with the belt and buckle that shows all this.

WE'RE BACK!     We are Harmattan Design (Holt Evans & Radu Zarnescu), Kickstarter veterans and Enthusiastic Creators. Last year, our fifth campaign The Smart Belt 2.0 became the most funded fashion accessory in history surpassing our own record from a year before (2017) when we introduced The Smart Belt.We sent out all the pledges and wanted to know what our backers had to say. To our delight, 96% of our backers where happy with The Smart Belt and manny thousands wanted more.We picked the most popular demands and integrated them into The Smart Belt 3.0. TAKE A LOOK!    What we believe is that there is no one thing that made our SMART BELT 2.0 such a huge success, but the combination of all our innovations bundled into a nice and elegant, finely tuned package with all our 4 INNOVATIONS made even better.    Firstly, replacing the 5 hole system with 32 adjustments brings a world of comfort and a whole new dimension of adjustability. Not many people think about it or realize it but, our waist changes as we go about our business throughout the day. A classic belt does not adjust correctly because holes are too far apart.   Forget feeling tight or loose, you'll forget you have a belt on but your pants will stay exactly where they're supposed to.         Our Kevlar® Core built with Kevlar® fibres is our staple innovation. Belts wear out because the leather flexes longitudinally and loses structure. Our Kevlar® Core prevents that from happening by reinforcing the whole structure like nothing else. It makes the whole thing highly durable yet light and comfortable.  We are the only licensee authorized by DuPont to make belts using the Kevlar® brand.DuPont™ and Kevlar® are trademarks or registered trademarks of E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company used under license by Harmattan Design LLC  (Project Creators).    The Leather we use is the most exclusive leather anywhere in the world. Vegetable Tanning is almost a lost art. Because it takes longer to tan the leather with natural tannins it has been replaced by chromium tanning at the turn of the century. We get our leather from a small valley in Tuscany, Italy, one of the hand-full of places in the world where this is still done. It's much more resilient that normal leather, it's all natural, eco friendly and really smells good too. It will come with a certificate of authenticity and a serial number.    Have you ever had a problem with a wrong size or buying a present for someone, ever been in between sizes? Not our Smart Belt 3.0. You will get to make your own size, so no chance of getting it wrong. Please remember that our belt will cover a max. waist size of 115 cm / 45"".    For this year's Smart Belt 3.0 we have introduced a new type of leather finish that we call CROC. We have also kept all buckle types from last year. Have a look below.     We have a total of 36 possible combinations, you can get any. IF YOU WANT TO SEE ALL BUCKLE / STRAP COMBINATIONS IN HIGH RES CLICK HERE            Here's our secret to starting to ship in October, we're already making the straps and we have the buckles already.We are now shipping Kickstarter orders and Indie will follow. 
 On the experience of a Super Project last year, The Smart Belt 2.0 with 20.000 backers the one before that with 15.000 happy backers we know what it takes to get this done right . We are manufacturing beforehand and using a bit of stock as a buffer for any hurdle we might encounter. We will start shipping in August and fulfil in order of backer number at a rate of about 5000 backers per month with a better courier service this time.   SATISFACTION SURVEY TO 36.000 BACKERS !           We send out a satisfaction survey each year, to our knowledge we are the only Kickstarter Project to do so. We do it because we want to know if where doing right by our backers or not. Our result speak for themselves,  the numbers below are from last year's Smart Belt 2.0.       VIDEO REVIEWS FROM BACKERS  Smart Belt 2.0 - Some of our backers even sent us videos!Check them out here:  Smart Belt 1.0 - And these backers are from 2017.Check them out here:

Where can I buy another one?”Kickstarter, Backer #12302,  comment:“I got mine! And i like it a lot! Thx team”Kickstarter, Backer #13039,  comment:“the belts have just arrived in Surabaya, Indonesia. Everything about the belts are simply amazing. ????????”Kickstarter, Backer #10475,  comment:“The belt is tightened by pulling it through the buckle and the ratchet tightens in small steps. To release the belt, pull the end that pokes out of the buckle whilst pushing the buckle release knob and push the belt back through the buckle. Once you’ve done it a couple of times it becomes second nature. When you get the belt, the leather part is long enough to fit the widest waist (within reason). Wrap the belt around you and cut to length so what the middle of the ratchet on the front end of the belt meets the cut end of the belt. Best to cut longer and then fit the buckle. You can always trim a bit more so that it eventually it is cut to your size. There is a small cream leaflet that comes with the belt and buckle that shows all this. That’s how I did it, and it’s the most comfortable belt I have ever owned.”Kickstarter, Backer #159634,  comment:“I have just received my belts. Superior quality and excellent design. I would definitely order again. Many thanks!”Kickstarter, Backer #10455,  Bricks comment:“I received my belt yesterday. What a great design. Thanks.”Kickstarter, Backer #13032,  comment:“Got my belts today. Love them! Easy to put together, and they work great.”Kickstarter, Backer #9945, comment:“Arrived today in Tucson AZ.

<p><strong>INSPIRATION  </strong></p>
<p>The exquisite design of this timepiece draws inspiration from the magnificent race cars of the 40s and 50s, particularly the Maserati Type 250F, driven by Juan Manuel Fangio in his world famous victory at the 1957 Formula 1 Grand Prix race in Nürburgring. Our goal was to create a timeless but contemporary wristwatch, which, while both elegant and subtle, transmits a sense of excitement and speed; homage to an era of pioneers and mould-breaking engineering. Timeless and sophisticated in design, this timepiece is a reliable, precision instrument for everyday use.The DRZ_Type 250F is a dress watch with a sporting soul.</p>

<p>The design of the DRZ_Type_250F exudes passion and attention to detail.

<p><strong>CASE  </strong></p>

<p>With the aim of creating an unparallelled tactile experience, we have used a top quality, natural leather strap.

We have the pleasure to introduce you Direnzo’s first watch collection, a stylish timepiece born from a passion for modern design, tradition and motor racing. We hope you will accompany us as we embark on this exciting adventure. Hand-assembled in Switzerland, in an atelier specialised in high-end watches, each timepiece will be part of a limited series of 600 units. Each watch will be a unique, numbered piece.


READ WHAT THE PRESS SAYS:
Watchpaper:""To me, it is not the Maserati racing story that makes this watch fascinating, but the design, the proportions, the colours and the comfort on the wrist.""
The Time Bum: ""The fine lined and broadly spaced letters of the brand name at the top of the dial is balanced by a simple and effective rounded logo at the bottom. It is clean, legible, and highly attractive."" 
28 days earlier: ""The acid test for any watch is the time honoured question, “would you own one?” The answer here is a definite yes. The size is nice, the build is excellent with sapphire and the attention to detail. Most importantly though, it reminds me of being young, when the summer days seemed longer driving around with a few friends and the roof down.""
Watchtrotter: ""L’orologio trasmette a chi lo osserva grande passione e cura per i dettagli. Il quadrante è disegnato prendendo spunto dal tachimetro della Maserati Type 250F. I due grandi zeri che rimpiazzano le più classiche ore 12 danno un tocco di sportività e richiamano i vecchi cronografi."" 
MrMontre: ""C’est une montre construite pour durer, un instrument de précision parfait pour un usage quotidien. Au poignet, le rendu est équilibré et indéniablement élégant."" 
Watchisthis: ""The dial has a nostalgic appearance. The DRZ_Type 250f_B with a black dial and the DRZ_Type 250f_C with a white dial are a delightful combination of timeless design and an urban, modern look. Light and pleasant, the wrist feel is comfortable.""
Chrononautix: ""Das Gesamtpaket, welches Direnzo hier mit seinem Einstand abliefert ist hinsichtlich Preis-Leistung wirklich erste Sahne. Kurzum: Ihr dürft bedenkenlos zuschlagen, wenn euch das Vintage-Design gefällt. Insbesondere zu Beginn der Kickstarter-Kampagne lockt ein schnäppchenverdächtiger Preis von 270 CHF (ca. 235€). Dem Erfolg dürfte meiner Meinung nach nichts im Wege stehen – ich werde jedenfalls dabei sein und wünsche Sergio Di Renzo gutes Gelingen!""
Suave Watches: ""On the wrist, the DRZ_Type_250F is a pleasantly light-weight watch paired with a slim natural leather strap – soft and supple. The dial is extremely clear and appears much larger due to the slim bezel""
Relojes Increibles: ""Direnzo nos presenta, de este modo, el DRZ Type 250F, una pieza que reúne una serie de detalles seleccionados de una manera meticulosa. Sobre su esfera encontramos el primero de ellos; se trata del numeral 12, que ha sido sustituido por un 00, en un guiño a los cronómetros de mano de esa epoca.""
Petite Trotteuse: ""Les montres inspirées par l’automobile sont nombreuses, et provoquent toujours un ressenti agréable quand on les regarde ou qu’on les passe au poignet. Cette Direnzo ne fait pas tache dans la catégorie, avec une montre très réussie, de qualité, et résolument agréable à porter. Au poignet c’est un régal, tant au niveau du confort que de la lisibilité.""
Geargreed: ""Our honest opinion about the Direnzo watches is that they have put a lot of hard work into them and they honestly seem like they know what they are doing""

INSPIRATION  
The exquisite design of this timepiece draws inspiration from the magnificent race cars of the 40s and 50s, particularly the Maserati Type 250F, driven by Juan Manuel Fangio in his world famous victory at the 1957 Formula 1 Grand Prix race in Nürburgring. Our goal was to create a timeless but contemporary wristwatch, which, while both elegant and subtle, transmits a sense of excitement and speed; homage to an era of pioneers and mould-breaking engineering. Timeless and sophisticated in design, this timepiece is a reliable, precision instrument for everyday use.The DRZ_Type 250F is a dress watch with a sporting soul.

 DIAL  
The design of the DRZ_Type_250F exudes passion and attention to detail. The dial finds inspiration in the tachometer of the Type 250F, and in place of the number “12”, the dial displays “00” lending it a sporting touch, reminiscent of an old stopwatch. The calendar has been deliberately removed thus generating a meticulous design uncluttered by external elements that may upset the symmetry.

CASE  
Inspired by the dashboard gauges of old race cars, the polished 316L stainless steel case measures 40mm in diameter (without the crown), the height of the watch is visually reduced thanks to its dual-cylinder design: a floating bezel that rests on the main body.

HANDS  
The hands offer a delicate aesthetic, yet maintain a strong presence. Their colour, which contrasts with that of the dial, ensures effortless readability; a design priority throughout. The red second hand on both versions is a nod to the Maserati Type 250F.

AUTOMATIC MOVEMENT  
The caseback houses the robust Japanese Seiko NH35 automatic movement with hacking function. This movement is an exceptional high-spec, Japanese-made automatic movement featuring a 42-hour power reserve. The caseback is screwed down to ensure maximum water tightness.

SAPPHIRE CRYSTAL  
It features a double-domed sapphire crystal with double sided anti-reflective coating; a material that is known for its excellent scratch-resistant qualities, allowing the watch to look like new for many years.

WRISTBAND  
With the aim of creating an unparallelled tactile experience, we have used a top quality, natural leather strap. As an added detail, traditional hand-sewn stitches are reminiscent of the old-fashioned straps from the 50s, affording the watch an aesthetic that is both vintage and sporty. The wristband contains a quick release spring bar, so that the straps can be swapped in seconds without the need for special tools.

Inspired by the old-fashioned tool rolls used in car races in the 50s, this wallet has been designed to accompany you in your journeys and adventures. It has a special pocket for your passport, the warranty (or credit) card, two DRZ's or a watch plus additional strap.

Next, simply loosen the cord locks and use the soft handle to guide the straps under all your top layers. Then just slip out of The Undress, and you’ll be in your new outfit!
The Undress changes to fit YOU. Women’s bodies are very different, but most clothing companies design clothes to fit their idea of ONE ideal shape. So, we sought to challenge the norm and solve a complex problem with a simple, elegant solution - our brand new EVERFIT SYSTEM.With three adjustment points, The Undress transforms to your own perfect fit!  The Undress is so size friendly and adjustable, that Size “B”, fits women from Extra Small through Large, Size “C” fits women sizes XL-3XL, and we now have Size ""A"" for Youth! The Undress changes to match your style - Transform The Undress in 4 ways by using a combination of the cords, cord locks, and belt loops. It’s like 4 dresses in one!The Undress IS wearable everyday, and we hope it becomes a favorite item in your wardrobe that you wear on a regular basis.  NEW! Built-in Bra Padding: The Undress Version 3 has a brand-new soft padded lining that provides additional coverage in the chest area of The Undress. The padding is pliable (like swimsuit padding) and gives you perfect coverage. You can now wear The Undress casually, and without a bra if needed. Built-in, removable shelf bra (add-on option):  If you need support, quickly add an optional, fully adjustable shelf bra strap to provide better coverage and support for those who prefer it! Two Hidden Pockets: The Undress has zippered side-access openings with convenient hidden pockets to hold your small items like a cell phone, keys, and more. Self Packing: Convert The Undress into a small shoulder bag to take small items with you. You can also pack it away in your gear bag or car so you are prepared for everything! Car Seat Cover: Don’t have time to change out of your sweaty clothes after a workout? Don’t get you car seat dirty - use The Undress as an emergency car seat cover instead. It’s built to be as tough as you are. The Best Dress for Travel: The Undress is versatile and perfect for any destination. From the beach, the bar, a night on the town, or after a run - you’ll be prepared for anything on your travels. You can even change on a crowded tour bus or plane! Love it, or send it back! If it doesn’t fit, you can send it back and exchange for a different size, or get your money back. No questions asked! FABRIC DETAILS:SOLIDS: Content is being updated.

*If you see a color or print you like, please pledge as we may have these colors and prints exclusive to this campaign, and most likely will not be available in the future.
Due to the nature of fabric supply, some dresses may be limited in availability depending on the success of this campaign. The earlier you back this project, the better your selection will be, as we will be allowing earlier/certain backer groups to choose first.  In a rare case if fabric suppliers may not be able to provide the fabric shown, we will find a similar alternative.
**As is the nature of Indiegogo, all products shown are prototypes, and final designs, colors, fabrics, specifications, etc. may change.
PLEASE REFER TO YOUR FUTURE BACKERKIT SURVEY FOR FINAL COLORS & SPECIFICATIONS Introducing The Super Shawl Version 3! The brand new Super Shawl now has sleeves! So, on top of using it like a regular shawl, you can wear it like a cardigan to keep you warm when you're on the go. The Super Shawl is the perfect companion to wear with The Undress!  
You will choose your size and color after the campaign is over via a special email survey sent after June 25.
If you fall between Size B and C, choose B for a slimmer fit, or C for a more flowy fit.
Dresses shown are prototypes and final color choices are dependent on actual availability of fabrics shown at or near end of campaign.
For limited colors & prints, earlier backers will get first chance to order, so pledge early for the best selection!

We invite you to join thousands of our backers worldwide who are courageous, daring, bold, and passionate women from all over the world that represent the Courage to Change. Please pledge, and please share, and we look forward to having you become the first in the world to own The Undress Version 3, and join our founders family.  Co-Founders Dennis Caco & April Estrada Founders - Dennis Caco & April EstradaCustomer Service and Fulfillment Technology - Marat Z.Videographer - Matt M. Assistant Camera - Kyle S.Gaffer - Nicholas C.Key Grip - Kevin F.Photography - Jenna M.Graphic Design - Nestor P.Customer Service Support - WayvaProduction Manager - Clio K.Mr. Money Bags - Ben A.Padres Numero Uno - Margerita and Jerry EstradaModels: Evelyn Sun, Breanne Vaca, Luci Hanley, Jodi Gilbert, Natonya Pacchiarotti, Mandolin Badger, Steph Villegas, Kristi Kuttner, Kathleen Meehan, Tania Vasquez, Krisha Daugherty, Taylee Madrigal, Sidney Sarmiento, Nikki Jimenez, Jennifer Santini, Myla Tyco Generoso, Hawley Woods, Breeanne MacouzetTest Fit Team: Monique Ramos, Anavie Leelin, Sarah Dejesus, Rachelle Caco, Melissa Mednick, Chabeli Cazarez, Kristi RobustoSpecial Thanks:Eve Cafe & Yoga in Encinitas, CABoys & Girls Club of San DieguitoCasa de Doug SuttonA HUGE THANK YOU to our incredible team and everyone who blessed us with their time, energy, talent and support throughout our entire journey of creating The Undress Version 3.

Yes! Love it, or send it back for a money-back guarantee! No questions asked!Do you guarantee it will fit? Yes! If it doesn’t fit, you can exchange for a different size, or get your money-back. No questions asked!Why isn’t the bra strap included in the price? After we surveyed our customers, it was 50/50 in favor of a strap. So we did not want to force someone to buy the strap if they did not feel the need to have it. Also, it is quite laborious to make, so it does cost quite a bit to produce, and we make very little, if anything, on this item.How did you decide on the length, and why isn’t there a long version? This was debated and we made prototypes of both this current length and a longer version. We had test fitters try both, and the shorter length was the favorite BY FAR. The longer dress was quite cumbersome in comparison. But hey, if you really want a long version, email us and maybe we can be swayed!When does it ship?  Our target dates to ship are November-Dec 2017 for all Indiegogo Perks. These are estimates and are subject to change.Could the prints/colors really sell out? Fabric Supply is always limited, so it is possible that Indiegogo Prints/Colors may be limited.  We will keep you informed of which colors/fabrics will be available before you process your Perks through Backerkit.What is the washing/drying instructions? Information coming soon!What is the fabric content? Information coming soon!What if I fall between sizes? If you fall between L and XL, we recommend picking Size C and use the Everfit System to adjust The Undress to your desired fit.International Orders - Duties, Tariffs, Taxes are not included in price, and are the backers responsibility.",54.0,0,"7 Campaigns

<h3>Your Choice. Your World. Your Heart.</h3>
<p>That's our motto! Inspired by Nature, our mission is to motivate those around us to <strong>act for a greener tomorrow</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Back in 2015, more than 150 world leaders were at the UN headquarters to formally adopt a new agenda for sustainable development. This is composed of 17 Sustainable Development Objectives, which must be implemented by all the countries of the world during the next 15 years, until 2030. At NÜWA we want to follow those goals and this is our way to do so.</p>
<div> <div> </div>
</div>
<h3>How NÜWA gives back</h3>
<p><strong>1% of the proceeds will be donated to a non-profit</strong> in order to help provide clean water to Mozambique's affected villages.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562144327/jzzqv3qli5dxrykp2t7a.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>Sustainably Certified Process</h3>
<p>We only use sustainable raw materials: recycled cotton and recycled PET bottles. The generated yarn is high-quality, <strong>without the need of water consumption</strong>, toxic dyes or agrochemicals. The cotton we use is obtained through cuts of daily confections' fabric leftovers (textile industry surplus)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our meshes have no dyeing steps nor do they pollute the environment; Dyeing steps are not required, because the final color of cotton fiber is related to the color of the raw materials. Plus, we have opted for digital printing, the most <strong>ecological and highest quality solution</strong> on the market.</p>

Your Choice. Your World. Your Heart.
That's our motto! Inspired by Nature, our mission is to motivate those around us to act for a greener tomorrow.
 
Back in 2015, more than 150 world leaders were at the UN headquarters to formally adopt a new agenda for sustainable development. This is composed of 17 Sustainable Development Objectives, which must be implemented by all the countries of the world during the next 15 years, until 2030. At NÜWA we want to follow those goals and this is our way to do so.
  

How NÜWA gives back
1% of the proceeds will be donated to a non-profit in order to help provide clean water to Mozambique's affected villages.
 

 
We're partening up with this amazing NGO! In Africa, water is one of the major shortcomings and the lack of its quality is the N1 cause of most diseases. In addition to using raw materials that do not require water, we provide potable water and sanitation systems to communities in need. For each NÜWA purchase, part of the amount will revert to build clean water wells and other resources in some of the villages affected by Cyclone Idai in Mozambique.
 

Sustainably Certified Process
We only use sustainable raw materials: recycled cotton and recycled PET bottles. The generated yarn is high-quality, without the need of water consumption, toxic dyes or agrochemicals. The cotton we use is obtained through cuts of daily confections' fabric leftovers (textile industry surplus)
 
Our meshes have no dyeing steps nor do they pollute the environment; Dyeing steps are not required, because the final color of cotton fiber is related to the color of the raw materials. Plus, we have opted for digital printing, the most ecological and highest quality solution on the market.
 


 

We are certified by the following standards:

 
100% Recycled
Just like our clothing, our packaging, hang tags and labels… everything is 100% recycled and eco-friendly to guide our journey to zero waste!
 

 
Made in Portugal
We care about fair trade and responsable production. All the manufacturing is done in Portugal, as well as the design. Because it's our hometown, choosing Portugal not only helps the local economy, but guarantees quality standards and ultimately the safety of our workforce.

About the creator
I’m Catarina Lopes, founder of NÜWA. I've decided to ""join the green side"" and it's one of the best things I ever did! It all started with the desire to add value to the fashion industry, which shockingly ranks 2nd in the ranking of the world's most polluting industries. My team and I care deeply about our oceans, so, saving water is always on top of our minds.

We have designed the first watch that helps them understand how parents expect them to use their time. We believe this will help children form good habits and help them to take responsibility for their actions.Every child dreams to be a grown-up! Imagine how proud your young children would be with a watch on their arms just like you. Imagine how they would feel when the watch remind them to prepare their bag for the swimming lesson or to feed the fish before leaving: “I'm useful, I have a role to play in the family, I don't need my parents, I am autonomous!” It works in 3 modes adapted to different stages of childhood development. Octopus can grow with your child! The first mode helps kids understand time by association. It displays a big icon that is associated with a task to accomplish, according to a schedule set by the parent. The second and the third modes teaches kids to read digital and analog clock. It’s a scheduler for parents who are tired of power strugglesParents want to promote self-discipline in children because they know it’s the foundation for later success in life. When getting ready for school devolves into one power struggle after another, everyone loses. Your child wants to have ownership over the process. Parents just want to get out the door by 8:15.Parents program visual reminders on their smartphone that will pop up on the watch at certain times (with a discreet vibration). It's an assistantOctopus is an assistant for your child, but the system as a whole helps the parents too.It helps you teach good habits to your kids without overwhelming them; It’s an educational tool. “Be consistent, coherent, predictable and clear about your expectations, teach few tasks at a time”.It becomes a partner in parenting by helping to enact proven methodology. For example, kids learn better when given specific instructions. Octopus can help to break down tasks and go step by step. Example: Put the blocks in their container, then Tidy up the robots in their box, then come to Dinner, etc.”. It grows with your kidsEverything is setup via an app, so Octopus can evolve with your ever-changing needs. It provides templates for routines based on age and gender. You can adjust them or create new ones from scratch. It syncs up in real time via Bluetooth. Everything is stored physically on the memory of the watch, so the system can keep track of the progress. It grows up with the kids. Some features are unlocked based on the age, like new clock faces for instance.... and it's fun!And of course, it’s fun for the kids. But we kept the level of distraction low. It’s a tool, not a toy! No video games, no messaging system...There is an optional gamification feature built into the system. If it is turned on, your kid will be able to unlock virtual rewards such as special badges based on their progress.  The dashboard available on your smartphone is a great tool to track progress and provide positive reinforcement.  Octopus is mainly for kids aged 3 to 8 years old, but the sleek design is appealing even to older children (they can use Octopus as a task manager).Octopus can also help the kids with special needs (AD/HD, ASD, Diabetes, Down Syndrome, or executive functioning issues). Children with special needs often require frequent prompting to complete tasks. Instead of getting in a shouting match, use Octopus as a tool for repeated prompting. Your child gets the prompts they need, parents retain their sanity, and the whole family is happier. Octopus can be used by parents in tandem with therapists, psychologists, and teachers to provide a reliable and comprehensive scheduling tool that is adept at maintaining consistency across settings.   Our mission is to reinvent how parents share time with their children: no more stress, no more power struggles, only precious moments spent focusing on what really matters: quality family moments. The power of routines 50 years of psychological research have proven that having routines in place in the family reduces the level of stress, prevents conflicts and it helps the kids to be more organized, focused, independent, cooperative. It makes it easier for them to assimilate good habits and it also teach them to be on schedule.But to maintain routines it requires consistency and persistency.Today’s fast-paced world presents many challenges because kids are exposed to a lot of distractions (TV, tablets, video games) and have more and more activities besides school. On the other hand, you, the parents, work a lot and even at home, it may be hard to disconnect from your job, your social life, etc. Consequently, spending quality time with your kids is harder, and it requires a lot of energy to teach them good habits.Octopus is here to help you with that! Even with more than 15 years of experience in the tech industry, building an electronic product is always a big challenge. Doing it from France or from the United-States is doable, but it takes more time, more resources and more money. We decided to apply to the world’s first and largest hardware accelerator HAX, which offers facilities in China and access to an incredible network of mentors and experts. We were selected from a large field of applicants!HAX is in the heart of the “Silicon Valley for hardware” in Shenzhen, 40 minutes north of Hong-Kong.  One of the multiple upsides of being in Shenzhen, China, in a super equipped lab like the one of HAX is that we could produce several prototypes very fast. Making a hardware device is always a trade-off between user experience, technology and cost but we started with no limits. We didn’t want to be constrained. We wanted to explore all the possibilities that were making sense, and we wanted to test them fast.    We tested with a lot of parents and their kids. Then we realized that to reach out to more parents, we should bring schools on-board. And because we are citizen of the world, we decided to test on 3 continents! During this testing phase, we discovered that our solution could tremendously help children born with disabilities like AD/HD (Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder), ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder), Down Syndrome, A-type diabetes, executive function issues, etc. Having members of our families dealing with the daily challenges from some of these conditions, we were very deeply motivated to improve our product even more.We also have created an important community on Facebook and we would like to take this opportunity to thank all the parents for their feedback, comments and encouragements. In parallel of developments and prototyping, we conducted interviews with parents, teachers, and child specialists to define the feature set of the product. We wanted to be as efficient and simple as possible.Watch the co-founder interview: We received hundreds of encouragements and we can't thank our community enough for this. It has really boosted us.   The watch comes with a charging cable. An optional charging station can be purchased, which transforms into a nightlight when the watch is attached to it!   We are a team of passionate individuals with backgrounds in engineering, business, marketing, child development, product design, ...Sam & Omar, JOY co-founders Sam HickmannSam is a proud father of 2 kids. He loves to create technology projects that transform people’s life. He’s an entrepreneur, an author, a husband and absolutely adore exploring new cultures. When he’s not working, he’s probably hacking some code with his son, drawing magical worlds with his daughter or travelling somewhere to spark his creativity.Omar AlaoufOmar is a Jack of all trades.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What Sparked the Movement</h3>
<p>It started in November of 2009.  We took a trip to Burkina Faso and experienced babywearing for the first time.  We didn’t know it at the time, but we had joined the babywearing movement.</p>
<p>We loved it, and we wanted to make it simple and accessible for all parents.

FAQs
Please leave a comment to ask a question.  Here are answers to the top questions we've already received:
When will we be able to choose what size and color we want? You will be able to select your size and style as soon as our campaign ends.

We cannot offer cash refunds after our campaign ends, but we can offer you a store credit if desired. We do not offer exchanges and returns on international shipments. 
 
What Sparked the Movement
It started in November of 2009.  We took a trip to Burkina Faso and experienced babywearing for the first time.  We didn’t know it at the time, but we had joined the babywearing movement.
We loved it, and we wanted to make it simple and accessible for all parents. So we leveraged our lives to make simple babywearing a reality.  It has been an adventure of ups and downs that we wouldn’t trade for anything. It began with 2 years of nights and weekends designing a babywearing solution that would be simple.
On September 10th, 2013... we shipped the first Soothe Shirt.  That day the simple babywearing movement began. Since then over 25,000 moms and dads have joined the movement by wearing their babies in a Soothe Shirt or Dad Shirt.
Parents enjoying their babies is what we’re all about.  It is why our driving purpose statement is “we work for new lives.”  Our company exists to make the lives of babies, parents and moms around the world better.  We do this in three ways:

<p>As with any pioneering projects, come risks and challenges.  With this DOI SmartRing, came one of the hardest challenges yet: to create a ring small enough to be stylish and durable, but filled with innovative features. We strive to create the best for our customers, which also mean we require the best materials to make this ring.  The product had to be lightweight enough to wear, yet stylish enough where it is capable of hiding such high tech technology.  Through multiple failed attempts and a lot of testing on our end, we’re finally able to create one of the most innovative product yet.</p>
<p>SUPPLY CHAIN AND LOGISTICS</p>
<p>We have access to high-volume material suppliers that will help ensure we can ramp up production quickly. Nonetheless all consumer electronics projects encounter some risk when transitioning production from alpha to finished units. We believe we've minimized this risk for the DOI SmartRing by having constructed and tested prototypes and pre-alpha production units for adherence to design spec, reliability, and ability to be manufacturable in high volumes. We also believe that the know-how we've gained from our history of 15 years of high-volume manufacturing of accessories for mobile and other consumer devices will minimize this risk.</p>
<p>We have established relationships with multi-modal (land, sea, air)  shipping companies as well as with major consumer electronics distributors and do not consider shipping and distribution as special challenges, wherever you are located. We heard your comments and have been able to provide Free Shipping for US Domestic and flat-rate shipping for international shipments. Keep in mind that some countries may have custom restrictions which you may have to check.</p>
<p>INJECTION MOLDING AND PRINT HEADS</p>
<p>We have trusted long-term relationships with parts vendors for all the parts of the DOI SmartRing. Just to be safe, we will also secure additional backup vendors for key parts so we don't be depend on only one supplier.</p>
<p>ENGINEERING TEAM</p>
<p>We've assembled a team of the best and brightest designers and engineers, from experts in ASICS, Bluetooth®, PCB, and mobile OS to product usability, safety, and human engineering. We've tested our prototype and paths to Six Sigma standards. As part of this process we will be continuing with testing but we won't rest until we ensure the DOI SmartRing is flawless.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Q: How much will battery last with a full charge?  And how do you charge it?</p>
<p>A: With our current prototype, depending on usage, battery can last between 1-3 days.  DOI SmartRing can be charged using most QI wireless charging stations. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: How can I choose the color of the ring that I want?</p>
<p>A: Once the project is funded and we are close to finalizing orders, you will be receiving a survey email where you can specify your preferred color.  To ensure a timely delivery, if you do not specify a color, the black DOI SmartRing will be shipped.</p>

I intend to have customizable backgrounds and alerts and alarms for your BAC levels and personal calendar. The watch will be designed with battery efficiency in mind. It will be an elegant and rugged time peace for all day wear and use in any environment, whether you are pool side or out on the town. If the goal is exceeded more sensors will be integrated into the design. Please help me make this idea a reality so we can all party on safely!This project is important to me as  someone who has struggled with drinking responsible my whole life and having been convicted of a DWI I want to make everyone more aware  and a safer place for all. I would like to integrate solar and kinetic charging to help increase time between charges. As for alcohol detection I will be using sensors similar to police monitoring bracelets. I have contacted a fellow inventor that is working on a improved version not yet realeased. Patent Pending",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As the parent of a teenage son, I quickly recognized that wearing pants low was a style of the times that was going to endure the criticism aimed at it.

<h3>The idea</h3>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><p>The peculiarness of just high priced watches sparked in us - a group of watch professionals and enthusiasts from Slovenia - an interest. We asked ourselves:</p>
<p><b>is it possible to build a top grade Swiss Made dive watch at reasonable price?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Long story short, we found out that not only we can build a high quality certified product for the same prices as other brands, but we can even substantially lower the retail price of the timepiece. Although we had opportunities to develop our product under already established brand names, we took the rather bold decision to build a new brand from scratch. This would give us freedom in design, market positioning and overall brand recognition. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The answer to the ‘’fairly priced’’ question took 4 years and considerable resources. But finally, in nov. 2015 the last pieces fell into place and we are proud to present - the <b>Haldor Abissi</b>.<br/></p>

<br/><h4>What’s so special about Swiss watches?</h4>
<div>Swiss watches are famed for their <b>accuracy</b>, <b>superb craftsmanship </b>and<b> tradition</b>. So when purchasing a Swiss Made watch you aren't just purchasing a time piece you are <b>purchasing history</b>. Something you will be proud of and want to pass down for generation to generation.
<p></p>When it comes to Swiss watches, we all know how accurate they are. When we choose the ETA 2824-2 movement, known for its robustness and accuracy, we started comparing its accuracy with high-end luxury watches. The accuracy was very close, but we wanted more! So we asked ourselves:</div>
<b style=""background-color: initial;""></b>
<p></p>
<b>
Can we reach the COSC Chronometer accuracy?

</b><p></p>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">COSC</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> is, the Official Swiss Chronometer Testing Institute, which is the institute responsible for certifying the accuracy and precision of wristwatches in Switzerland. Those watches are know as the most accurate watches in the world. </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Making this tests would significantly increase the final price of our product, so we </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">couldn‘t</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> afford it. </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Before we started with the design we also had to buy a stock of ETA 2824-2 movements. There is a very limited quantity on the market and the retail price is too high. We had to find an other way.</span>
</div>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><p><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;"">The solution </span><br/></p></span></div>
<div>
<div>The solution was in our Swiss manufacturing company. As a professional company according to the strict rules of Switzerland
watchmaking, they are able to supply us the Swiss Made ETA
2824-2 at price which is suitable for us.  We still had to make a full payment in advance and wait for a long delivery time. But we are here for a long run project so we did it!<br/>
</div>
<div>
<p>Thanks to our Swiss partner we are able to adjust the already very accurate movement ETA 2824-2 to a <b>Top Grade level</b>. The 2824-2 is an automatic winding, twenty-five jewel movement, available in four grades: Standard, Elaborated (improved), Top and Chronometer.</p>
<p>To illustrate the differences in accuracy garnered by the successive grades, consider the following specifications:</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1450315880/pro254zz0swixtfkfubm.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 579.12px;height: 228px;""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Haldor Abissi, our first
product, is <b>accurate like a COSC Chronometer!</b> This is possible when an ETA
2824-2 movement is adjusted in 5 positions to a Top Grade level. </p>
<p>Check out the results:</p>
<h4>THE ACCURACY</h4>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1450395484/ignd3pxmvzvhs0ptmya7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>You can see the accuracy of Haldor
Abissi is about <b>+4,5s/d</b> with a maximum dialy variation of 7sec. The results are
fascinating and we are proud of it. <b>Each watch supplied by Haldor Watches will
pass the quality control and water pressure tests. Every single watch will be
adjusted to a top grade level, which will come with its technical data of
accuracy shown like on photo. </b><b>We guarantee out of the
box accuracy of about +4s/d.</b> </p>

Thanks to all our supporters for reaching the goal so easily. The campaign ended, but you can still pre-order the Abissi watch at a pre-order price, before the the delivery starts. The first stretch goal is unlocked and you will receive an extra NATO strap for free. Because of the big demand, we decided to add the Carbon fiber strap to the Abissi watch, although the campaign ended at 51.915USD. All the orders made after the end of the campaign will include the extra NATO and the Carbon fiber strap for free.

The idea

The peculiarness of just high priced watches sparked in us - a group of watch professionals and enthusiasts from Slovenia - an interest. We asked ourselves:
is it possible to build a top grade Swiss Made dive watch at reasonable price?

Long story short, we found out that not only we can build a high quality certified product for the same prices as other brands, but we can even substantially lower the retail price of the timepiece. Although we had opportunities to develop our product under already established brand names, we took the rather bold decision to build a new brand from scratch. This would give us freedom in design, market positioning and overall brand recognition. 

The answer to the ‘’fairly priced’’ question took 4 years and considerable resources. But finally, in nov. 2015 the last pieces fell into place and we are proud to present - the Haldor Abissi.



Haldor is a Scandinavian name, derived from the Old Norse words 'hallr', which means 'rock', and 'Thor', the 'god of thunder' in Norse mythology.


Haldor Abissi 1000m

Haldor Abissi is an automatic dive watch capable of withstanding water pressure up to a depth of 1000m/3300ft. Equipped with a Swiss Made ETA 2824-2 automatic movement (adjusted in 5 positions to a Top Grade level), is without any doubt the most accurate dive watch in its class. By »top grade« we are referred to the accuracy of the movement. 









The Abissi on 6,7"" (17cm) wrist.


Although the design is what most watch enthusiasts see
first, it’s not where the process of making a timepiece starts. Before the size of the case, the shape of the hands, the thickness of the sapphire crystal,...is the actual centerpiece of the device: the movement. We could opt for a number of decent quality manufacturers, that would nicely fit into the expected price range of our product, but we didn’t want compromises. Therefore the choice was obvious. We choose the most commonly used automatic movement in Swiss brands like: Tudor, Tag Heuer, Breitling and many other. The ETA 2824-2 automatic movement.






What’s so special about Swiss watches?
Swiss watches are famed for their accuracy, superb craftsmanship and tradition. So when purchasing a Swiss Made watch you aren't just purchasing a time piece you are purchasing history. Something you will be proud of and want to pass down for generation to generation.
When it comes to Swiss watches, we all know how accurate they are. When we choose the ETA 2824-2 movement, known for its robustness and accuracy, we started comparing its accuracy with high-end luxury watches. The accuracy was very close, but we wanted more! So we asked ourselves:



Can we reach the COSC Chronometer accuracy?


COSC is, the Official Swiss Chronometer Testing Institute, which is the institute responsible for certifying the accuracy and precision of wristwatches in Switzerland. Those watches are know as the most accurate watches in the world. Making this tests would significantly increase the final price of our product, so we couldn‘t afford it. Before we started with the design we also had to buy a stock of ETA 2824-2 movements. There is a very limited quantity on the market and the retail price is too high. We had to find an other way.



The solution 

The solution was in our Swiss manufacturing company. As a professional company according to the strict rules of Switzerland
watchmaking, they are able to supply us the Swiss Made ETA
2824-2 at price which is suitable for us.  We still had to make a full payment in advance and wait for a long delivery time. But we are here for a long run project so we did it!


Thanks to our Swiss partner we are able to adjust the already very accurate movement ETA 2824-2 to a Top Grade level. The 2824-2 is an automatic winding, twenty-five jewel movement, available in four grades: Standard, Elaborated (improved), Top and Chronometer.
To illustrate the differences in accuracy garnered by the successive grades, consider the following specifications:



Haldor Abissi, our first
product, is accurate like a COSC Chronometer! This is possible when an ETA
2824-2 movement is adjusted in 5 positions to a Top Grade level. 
Check out the results:
THE ACCURACY

You can see the accuracy of Haldor
Abissi is about +4,5s/d with a maximum dialy variation of 7sec. The results are
fascinating and we are proud of it. Each watch supplied by Haldor Watches will
pass the quality control and water pressure tests. Every single watch will be
adjusted to a top grade level, which will come with its technical data of
accuracy shown like on photo. We guarantee out of the
box accuracy of about +4s/d.

CASE DIAMETER: 45,5mm (excluding crown)


CASE HEIGHT: 15,5mm


CASE LENGTH: 57mm


LUG WIDTH: 24mm

WATER RESISTANCE: 1000m/3300ft, offically certified by Swiss test laboratory


MOVEMENT: Swiss Made ETA 2824-2 (Top Grade accuracy) (28.800 vibrations per hour, 25 Jewels)



THE DESIGN






Although there are many generic cases in the market, we wanted our watch to be unique. When the movement was chosen, the next step was to study the case design which will most perfectly fit the ETA 2824-2. 

Our watches are designed to be robust, durable, precise, functional and to satisfy the customer's own. 









WATER RESISTANCE
The Abissi is made to survive at extreme pressure conditions. Built in high-end materials like marine grade 316L stainless steel, zirconia ceramic bezel and ultra reisistant sapphire crystal, is capable of withstanding water pressure down to 1000m (3300feet).




Haldor Abissi is equipped with an automatic helium release valve. It’s purpose is to allow gases to escape from the watch. When the pressure outside the watch reaches levels that are significantly different from levels inside of the watch, the valve is activated, releasing the trapped helium atoms and lowering the pressure inside of the watch.
Reinforced caseback with 3D embossed logo made to survive extreme depths.


Screw down crown with embossed 3D logo.

Massive buckle with security buttons.
The case incorporates a Zirconia (ZrO2) ceramic bezel inlay water resistant up to depths of 1000m (3300ft). Zirconia is a silica-free, acid-resistant, polycrystalline ceramic that has no amorphous silica glass component. It is much harder than regular ceramic and is almost impossible to scratch it. 
To ensure the best visibility at night, we didn't use classic printing method on dial. When printing is not possible to apply enough powder. That's why the Super-LumiNova C3 powder is applied by hand! 


The watch passed all pressure and water resistance tests made in the Swiss lab.

We will add an extra 100% nylon Nato strap with engraved Haldor logo on buckle, if reached 40.000USD. 
High quality 316L buckle, lug size 24mm, lenght 280mm. Retail value of 20€.

 “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication”, - Leonardo da Vinci.

Some things are absolute: time, nature, beauty, art. The natural stone Kub combines all of them. In millions of years nature created a beauty and we transformed it into a piece of art. 
Kub is an elegant piece of art made by nature and shaped by human hands. It is a home décor accessory, a conversation starter, a bookend, a desk companion and simply a natural stone cube. In addition to Kub we give our backers more reward choices adding square marble coasters for drinks made from Italian marble: Carrara white. 
Elegant desk companion for office workers 
Conversation starter for anyone 
Unique home décor accessory  
Stylish bookend for readers  
​Did you know that the natural stone (either granite or marble) travels months all around the world till it is ready to be installed in your kitchen? And before that it takes months to take it out of the ground. Did you know that only about 3% of all mined natural stone is utilized for kitchen countertops? What about the rest 97%? Sometimes it is  used for building materials and sometimes is sitting for years at the warehouses. In fact, natural stone manufacturers prefer to work only with large slabs 120""x70"" therefore much smaller pieces may be used for something else. I have been exporting granite and marble  for the last 2 years. I saw firsthand how much stone is sitting on the back yards of the natural stone suppliers and waiting for its use.  That is why I decided to give a new life to those beautiful  pieces of marble and designed the Kub.We cut the natural stone remnants with precise measurements using CNC machines. Then 6 sides (10 cm each) of the cube are glued to make it geometrically even. Then it comes a hard part, each angle of the cube is polished by hand with the diamond disk, which takes a little bit of hard work & time but only in this way Kub can look seamless!

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We want to get merchandise for our event. As a charity group, we can't afford to spend money on merch at the risk that it will not sell, so we need to take pre-orders! We need to sell 50 pairs to keep the price low enough with our initial order.</p>
<p>You, dear reader, want to buy our merch! These shorts are fantastic quality microfibre, with both navy and royal blue options. They feature ""Relay@UWA"" down the left leg, and ""RELAY"" across the bum. You get a great new pair of shorts, and you'll be helping us promote a fantastic event!</p>
<p>So order a pair for yourself, and convince your friends to get some too! Help us get to the minimum pre-order number of 50!</p>

<p><strong>We eat organic food. We apply organic skincare. We use organic tampons ... it's time our underwear are organic too. </strong>The Annual Brief™ was born out of the belief that what we put on our body should be as healthy and clean as what we put in our body. Each Brief is made of 100% certified organic pima cotton - a naturally hypoallergenic, silky smooth fabric that's 100% free of toxins, synthetics and pesticides. And because studies show we should replace our everyday underwear once a year to stay healthy, we take the guesswork out of knowing when it's time to refresh your underwear drawer. Each pair comes with a unique D.O.B. to help keep track. Stick with us, and never worry about underwear shopping again.</p>

<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p><strong>Where Your Money Goes</strong>: When you support us by ordering The Annual Brief, or savings with our Annual Brief Bundles, not only will you get that reward but you'll also be helping to make this project a reality.  Your pledge will help pay for the fabric weaving and production in Peru, and make sure our factory in LA can be paid well for their hard work. In short, it will be greatly appreciated and, we hope, help launch a whole new category of healthy, organic pima cotton under-apparel.</p>

<p><strong>SHIPPING</strong>: All pledges $50 and over qualify for free domestic shipping within the US, and all other domestic orders ship for $10. Shipping for orders shipped to Canada will be $15. Shipping for all other international orders will be $25. You should include this amount in your Kickstarter pledge by visiting our Kickstarter page and clicking ""manage your pledge"" button that sits next to our video. The average number of days for shipping may vary based upon origin and destination. Please also bare in mind any duty or taxes on import into your country will be your responsibility. Expedited shipping available - please contact us to arrange. </p>
<p><strong>RETURNS</strong>: We want you to love your Annual Brief! We understand mistakes with sizing will be made and we will do our best to exchange your  Briefs for the right size. Try on one Brief from your order and request an exchange for a different size or style for the rest, if needed. Keep all original protective liners and tags in tact. Because our margins are really tight, we will have to charge for the freight cost of any returns. </p>

<h3>How to Pre-Order</h3>
<p>To pre-order The Annual Brief,  pick a reward that contains The Annual Brief. Once you have pledged, sit back and relax - we’ll be in touch to collect your style, color, size and shipping information.</p>

<p>This is KENT Woman's 3rd year in manufacturing organic underwear. We've got some great experience behind us on how to manufacture high-quality underwear and loungewear, and fulfill lots of orders for them. We've also always dealt with unexpected challenges in a way that leaves every last customer happy with their purchase and proud to support our company.</p>
<p>In short, we know what we're doing, and you should be very confident that we will deliver what we say we will, when we say we will. And we solemnly swear that should unforeseen issues come up, we will handle them with transparency and care for you, our backers.</p>
<p><u>Forecasting Risk </u><br/>If all goes well during our funding campaign, we'll finish up with enough preorders for The Annual Brief. Of course we're trying our hardest to predict our future demand and plan accordingly, but it's far from an exact science.</p>
<p><u>Supply Chain Risk </u><br/>As KENT continues to evolve we're perfecting the art of managing our supply chain. We're so thrilled on how far we've developed our supply chain - fabric to factory. It's always safe to say that there is still some risk here. If a container shipment is delayed for 2 weeks in customs, for instance, our fulfillment schedule—even if padded—can start to slip.</p>
<p><u>Acts of God </u><br/>We're based in Los Angeles. That means we could have an earthquake. Or we could have a massive spur-of-the-moment beach party and parade involving brilliant costumes or public nudity. Whatever happens, we'll get through it together. We promise.</p>

</div></div>","We eat organic food. We apply organic skincare. We use organic tampons ... it's time our underwear are organic too. The Annual Brief™ was born out of the belief that what we put on our body should be as healthy and clean as what we put in our body. Each Brief is made of 100% certified organic pima cotton - a naturally hypoallergenic, silky smooth fabric that's 100% free of toxins, synthetics and pesticides. And because studies show we should replace our everyday underwear once a year to stay healthy, we take the guesswork out of knowing when it's time to refresh your underwear drawer. Each pair comes with a unique D.O.B. to help keep track. Stick with us, and never worry about underwear shopping again.

The production will be limited to 300pcs per style the first production year.MARNAUT's Dark Surge 300m will come in three variations:MDS300S (Silver Bezel) - Full silver – a brushed stainless steel 316L case with a silver bezel  MDS300T (Black Bezel) – Two-tone classic – a brushed stainless steel 316L case with black bezel  MDS300B (Full Black IP Plating) – All black – a brushed stainless steel 316L case, fully IP plated with a black bezelPride in craft Marnaut is about creating stylish and enduring limited-batch dive watches. Our timepieces work at depths of 300m and have the high-grade materials and craftsmanship to match. All our watches are engineered to meet higher specifications than most others and house one of the best automatic movements around, the Miyota 9015. Original yet classicNew watch brands are constantly surfacing, but Marnaut is not like the rest. We go beyond the simplicity and wearability of the others to bring a high-performance, modern-day classic to the dive-watch segment. We have gone to great lengths to source the best components and develop a one-of-a-kind timepiece that stands confidently alongside luxury brands, which cost far more.300 Pieces per yearMarnaut is a small, independent watch brand that prides itself on creating a unique product. As a result, production of the Dark Surge 300m is capped at:  MDS300T (Two-tone Black Bezel) 300pcs per year MDS300S (Silver Bezel) 300pcs per year MDS300B (Full Black IP Plated) 300pcs per year  Capping supply means Marnaut timepieces hold their value and our customers have pride in ownership. Two-factor verification Our two-factor verification proves you are buying a watch that has a limited yearly supply. Each Marnaut Dark Surge 300m has a serial production number etched on the back of the case and a unique QR code is provided for verification via mobile app.Scanning the QR code using the app CertiEye (on android or ios) will produce a serial number that matches the one stamped on the case. The app will not scan a copy of the authentication card, only the original will work. Any watch without the two-step verification or these matching serial numbers is not Marnaut. Here’s how our two-step verification works (video here):They say the dial makes the watch. It is within Marnaut’s 34mm face where the heart and soul of our timepieces exist. The design of our one-of-a-kind enamel finished dial was guided by the texture and symmetry of the extraordinary and enduring sea urchin shell. There are more than 900 species of sea urchin spread across the length and breadth of the world’s oceans. One of longest living creatures on Earth, they inhabit and endure the darkest, most inhospitable and extreme corners of the ocean.Markers Marnaut dials house 46 metal indexes, including circular, numbered and line markers. Each is carefully pinned through the dial and secured only millimetres apart, making the production process extremely complex. Such detail requires exact precision and skill, and if any element is just a fraction of a millimetre off, the entire dial is rendered useless. Symmetry LumiNova Marnaut uses Super-LumiNova C3, the world's best lume from Switzerland. It is applied to all 46 metal indexes, the hands, as well as the bezel for the 300T and 300B, (C3 Super-LumiNova is not applied on the 300S bezel). The unique dial together with the Super-LumiNova makes them glow in captivating symmetry like no other watch on the market.Case and crystal The Marnaut Dark Surge 300m is fitted with a scratch-proof domed shaped sapphire crystal and custom brushed case, which is designed to sit perfectly on the wrist. The gasket fitted screw-down back cover and double O-ring screw-down crown ensures water resistance to depths of 300 meters.Bezel All Marnaut Dark Surge 300m watches are fitted with 120-click unidirectional rotating bezels and are made of anodized aluminium.  We have three variations: MDS300S - Silver anodized aluminium (no Super-LumiNova C3 applied on bezel) MDS300T - Black anodized aluminium MDS300B - Black anodized aluminiumUnder the hoodThe Marnaut Dark Surge 300m is powered by the industry leading automatic Miyota 9015 movement. The 24-jewel movement beats at 28,800bph, giving it a super smooth hand sweep. It has a 42-hour plus power reserve, hand winding and hacking.StrapsEach Marnaut timepiece will come with two straps: One silicone and one Italian distressed leather. MDS300S - 1x silicone, 1x cream distressed Italian leather MDS300T - 1x silicone, 1x grey distressed Italian leather MDS300B - 1x silicone, 1x black distressed Italian leather TestingAdditional strapsIf you would like to purchase additional straps please get in touch with us. TestingMarnaut watches are tested to 30ATM (300 metres) in a water pressure chamber.

<p>November is not the only time of year we can help people affected by prostate cancer, testicular cancer, and other issues that affect men's physical and mental health.  These are things as a man have personally affected me or someone I know.  I want to give back to these important aspects of men's health.  The Power-Stache is about personal strength all year round.  It’s also a reminder that giving back feels good. That is whyI have pledged 50% of Power-Stache’s profits to men’s health related causes.  </p><p>The
Power-Stache started out as a fun side project and something I wanted to use at
work.  I mean, mustaches are cool!  Unfortunately I am not blessed
with a full face of hair like some, so my Power-Stache can be my amazing facial
hair! Then I asked myself, ""Why can’t my lack of facial hair and
sense of humor benefit more than just me?""   </p>

<p><span>At Crown Wood Eyewear we strive to bring you the most unique, stylish, and high quality sunglasses out there. The high quality of our materials is what separates us from other sunglass companies. Our imported Italian acetate mixed with our eco friendly Chinese bamboo, along with our polarized lenses and high quality steel hinges, makes our sunglasses truly a work of art. </span></p>
<p><span>No other sunglass company offers such high quality sunglasses at such a low price. Ray Ban and other premium sunglass companies over charge their sunglasses because they control the market price of high quality designer sunglasses. At Crown Wood Eyewear we want the world to know that the reign of overpriced high quality sunglasses is over. A new order has arrived, welcome to Crown Wood Eyewear. </span></p>

<p><span>It all began a few years ago when I couldn’t afford the overpriced designer sunglasses all my rich Los Angeles friends had. I was always stuck buying cheap street vendor sunglasses because it was the only way to fit in with the designer look without going broke. After some research, I found that it is near impossible to buy high quality sunglasses, the ones that don’t break or scratch the first time you sit on them, at an affordable price. I quickly came to the conclusion that this is outrageous!</span></p>
<p>Now, as a college student at the University of Arizona, I’ve decided to do something about it. Over the past year I've been working on a way to bring you high quality sunglasses at an affordable price. I decided to create a premium sunglass brand without the designer price tag. Every King has a Crown.</p>

</div></div>","At Crown Wood Eyewear we strive to bring you the most unique, stylish, and high quality sunglasses out there. The high quality of our materials is what separates us from other sunglass companies. Our imported Italian acetate mixed with our eco friendly Chinese bamboo, along with our polarized lenses and high quality steel hinges, makes our sunglasses truly a work of art. 
No other sunglass company offers such high quality sunglasses at such a low price. Ray Ban and other premium sunglass companies over charge their sunglasses because they control the market price of high quality designer sunglasses. At Crown Wood Eyewear we want the world to know that the reign of overpriced high quality sunglasses is over. A new order has arrived, welcome to Crown Wood Eyewear. 
In The Beginning
It all began a few years ago when I couldn’t afford the overpriced designer sunglasses all my rich Los Angeles friends had. I was always stuck buying cheap street vendor sunglasses because it was the only way to fit in with the designer look without going broke. After some research, I found that it is near impossible to buy high quality sunglasses, the ones that don’t break or scratch the first time you sit on them, at an affordable price. I quickly came to the conclusion that this is outrageous!
Now, as a college student at the University of Arizona, I’ve decided to do something about it. Over the past year I've been working on a way to bring you high quality sunglasses at an affordable price. I decided to create a premium sunglass brand without the designer price tag. Every King has a Crown.

It is a new revolution of clothes hanger (our life-partner product)! <br/><div><br/></div><div>
<h1>Why Sum Gua?</h1>
<p>We strongly believe that clothes hangers are not just widely used for hanging our clothes in the wardrobe, but also can be re-designed to make it more user friendly for outdoor clothes drying on clotheslines as well. That's why Sum Gua was born!</p>
<h2><i>Pegless Softouch</i></h2>
<p><i>Pegless Softouch</i> is a feature of holding your clothes fast and secure without using a single peg. <i>Softouch</i> means wrinkle free.</p>

</h4><div>
<p></p>
<p>An animation shows a clothesline interacts with a Sum Gua's windlocker: </p>
<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DI_zJbvwXzfc&amp;src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FI_zJbvwXzfc&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p>The idea behind the <i>Windlocker*</i> is to utilise the characteristic of rubberized soft PVC clotheslines together with the flexible characteristic of PP material so for the <i>Windlocker*</i> to hold with the clothesline tightly from the winds blow.</p>
<p>Due to it requires material's flexible characteristic to proof this concept, it means that final confirmation of this idea will only be able to finalise during the initial off tool samples trial and design fine tuning. </p>
<p>We are also planning for a backup solution with offering a <i>Clothesline Hook</i> design if the <i>Windlocker*</i> did not solve some of the incredible strong winds. It could be one of our stretch goal offers!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2><i>Twinhead ezylife </i></h2>
<p>We love to take challenge so we are here to take a risk of introducing our Sum Gua with another feature called <i>Twinhead ezylife</i>. We all know that there this design will create a little disadvantage with slight tilting when hanging your clothes. However, after a few weeks of debating we voted for ""<i>makes life easy</i>"" rather than ""<i> looks ok</i>"". With a 100% symmetrical design of <i>Sum Gua</i>, consumers can always hang their clothes in the same orientation and shorter time spending so can also collect them in the quickest way. No more tangling concern!</p>

<p><i>**The above image is a rendering, not a real product.<br/><br/></i></p>
<h2><i>One Stop Solution</i></h2>
<p><i>Sum Gua</i> was created as one stop solution for our laundry job with only one off hanging action from drying the clothes on the clotheslines until hanging them in the wardrobe. Thanks to all of the above features!</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465481814/Sum_Gua_One_Stop_Rev2_oebo9g.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h1><b><i><br/></i></b></h1>
<h3><b><i>Green Your Life - Cheer Your Life</i></b></h3>
<p>We support green life so we 100% support drying clothes in the sun rather than in the dryer.</p>
<p>According to an online article, clothes dryers use an average of nearly 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity annually. That's remarkable when you consider that a typical household in the United States consumes a total of about 11,000 kilowatt hours of electricity per year; your clothes dryer could be accounting for ten percent of your total electricity use! The majority of the electricity in the United States is generated by burning fossil fuels. The burning of fossil fuels is associated with many harmful environmental effects, such as global warming, air pollution, water and land pollution, and thermal pollution. A simple shirt, during all of its years of use, can send up to 9 pounds of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere![1]</p>
<p>That's the main reason why Sum Gua is here. It is here to simplify the traditional way of hard work or minimise use of clothes pegs so to make everyone enjoy drying clothes in the natural sunlight.</p>

</div></div>","What is Sum Gua?Sum Gua /衫掛 / means clothes hanger in Malaysian Cantonese. It is a new revolution of clothes hanger (our life-partner product)! 
Why Sum Gua?
We strongly believe that clothes hangers are not just widely used for hanging our clothes in the wardrobe, but also can be re-designed to make it more user friendly for outdoor clothes drying on clotheslines as well. That's why Sum Gua was born!
Pegless Softouch
Pegless Softouch is a feature of holding your clothes fast and secure without using a single peg. Softouch means wrinkle free.


**The above image is a rendering, not a real product.

Windlocker*
**The above image is a rendering, not a real product.

How Windlocker* works?  


An animation shows a clothesline interacts with a Sum Gua's windlocker: 

The idea behind the Windlocker* is to utilise the characteristic of rubberized soft PVC clotheslines together with the flexible characteristic of PP material so for the Windlocker* to hold with the clothesline tightly from the winds blow.
Due to it requires material's flexible characteristic to proof this concept, it means that final confirmation of this idea will only be able to finalise during the initial off tool samples trial and design fine tuning. 
We are also planning for a backup solution with offering a Clothesline Hook design if the Windlocker* did not solve some of the incredible strong winds. It could be one of our stretch goal offers!

Twinhead ezylife 
We love to take challenge so we are here to take a risk of introducing our Sum Gua with another feature called Twinhead ezylife. We all know that there this design will create a little disadvantage with slight tilting when hanging your clothes. However, after a few weeks of debating we voted for ""makes life easy"" rather than "" looks ok"". With a 100% symmetrical design of Sum Gua, consumers can always hang their clothes in the same orientation and shorter time spending so can also collect them in the quickest way. No more tangling concern!

**The above image is a rendering, not a real product.
One Stop Solution
Sum Gua was created as one stop solution for our laundry job with only one off hanging action from drying the clothes on the clotheslines until hanging them in the wardrobe. Thanks to all of the above features!



Green Your Life - Cheer Your Life
We support green life so we 100% support drying clothes in the sun rather than in the dryer.
According to an online article, clothes dryers use an average of nearly 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity annually. That's remarkable when you consider that a typical household in the United States consumes a total of about 11,000 kilowatt hours of electricity per year; your clothes dryer could be accounting for ten percent of your total electricity use! The majority of the electricity in the United States is generated by burning fossil fuels. The burning of fossil fuels is associated with many harmful environmental effects, such as global warming, air pollution, water and land pollution, and thermal pollution. A simple shirt, during all of its years of use, can send up to 9 pounds of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere![1]
That's the main reason why Sum Gua is here. It is here to simplify the traditional way of hard work or minimise use of clothes pegs so to make everyone enjoy drying clothes in the natural sunlight.

We are passionate, adventure-seeking individuals that love to pursue inspired lives. Lives that fall outside of the norm. We stand for the ones who want to push forward to be and do more while creating unforgettable moments.Our mission is to start a movement and to foster a global community centered on creating life stories that are worth telling.    Inspired by the feeling we get whenever we set out to begin a new journey, this series was created with the belief that the next chapter of your story can take place anywhere you are.      Click to download more high-res photos!Click to download more high-res photos!Click to download more high-res photos!Click to download more high-res photos! We heard your feedback about the straps loud and clear from our previous line! This time, we went with a superior-class Genuine Italian Leather with quick release straps on ever watch. That means you can change the bands in a matter of seconds with absolutely no tools needed! Swiss Ronda 763 movements included w/ EVERY watch! We couldn't be more thankful for our early supporters helping us jump start this company, and because of it, we want to genuinely give back. For all original backers who backed our first project (The Apollo Series), you will receive a FREE World Watch if you pledge for this campaign. Earlier this year, we had an incredibly successful campaign thanks to the monumental support of our backers. Throughout that fulfillment process, our team identified many issues with manufacturing and was able to implement fixes to better our overall production. With an entirely improved and streamlined distribution & supply chain for this second launch, we are happy to announce that you will receive your watch in just a few short months!The initial funds will be used for constructing and testing the numerous molds required to manufacture our product. With many custom parts, we require a much more extensive production process compared to most others. Additionally, the funds received will be used to streamline our current supply chain process even further in order to ship you the product in a MUCH shorter time frame!    We are proud to partner with United Planet to offer scholarships that will fund volunteering opportunities and travel abroad for students worldwide. A percentage of all proceeds from the campaign will be donated directly to this program.  This program is for you if you want to immerse in a world outside your own experience. You want to do your part to effect real change in small, underserved communities. You want to form bonds that last a lifetime. You want to push yourself and others to experience something wildly new, and at the same time discover the richness of giving back and helping others.And yeah, you want to see the world while you're doing it. Sound like you?  We wouldn't be here if it weren't for you guys. Simple as that. Our mission is to create a global community of wanderers, one story at a time. Use the hashtag #WARLDWIDE so we can curate yours!  For those interested in our influencer program, we are always looking for new and passionate content creators to join our global community.

<p>For the Dizmio wallet we wanted to create a wallet that was incredibly small and yet allows the user to carry as much cash/ cards as they want.</p>
<p>The Dizmio wallet:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has a slim, minimal, &amp; functional design</li>
<li>Allows the user to carry cash &amp; cards</li>
<li>Expands to be able to accommodate an insane amount of cards/ cash. We have tested it with up to 20 cards &amp; it still had room for more!</li>
<li>Helps protects against RFID skimming theft (watch our video below)</li>
<li>Is very durable and lightweight</li>
</ul><h1>Dimensions</h1>
<p>At its thinnest point the Dizmio wallet is only 2mm (0.079 inches) thick.</p>
<p>At the thickest point ( around the elastic strap) the Dizmio wallet is 6mm thick (0.24 inches).</p>
<h1>The Design</h1>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/479/010/73e6cbc46b4a575cd5a63d375cdc3ffd_large.png?1364583224"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>We went through countless prototypes until we settled on a Design that we believe fits all of our goals. The Dizmio wallet has a unique shape with very specific and functional grooves. The shape of the Dizmio wallet provides a pleasant user experience.</p>
<p>The images that you see are of the Dizmio wallet that you will receive. All images show the final production model of the Dizmio wallet.</p>
<p>The Dizmio wallet is composed of two aluminum plates &amp; one elastic strap.</p>
<h1>Mix &amp; Match aluminum plates</h1>
<p>Display your personality through your Dizmio wallet. Create your own wallet by mixing different colored aluminum plates! </p>
<p><strong>* Choose any two aluminum plate colors you like!</strong></p>

<p>There are two different pledges for the Dizmio wallet. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Pledge With logo</strong>: In this pledge you will receive the Dizmio wallet with our laser etched logo that can be seen in the images. The laser etched logo also helps to provide a rough surface to keep the outside cards even more secure. </li>
<li>
<strong>Pledge with NO logo</strong>: This pledge option is for the pure minimalists. There is no logo on the wallet. </li>
</ul><div> </div>

<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/479/013/3f341c67d1fed3ba5a0ec5d509c1ff0c_large.jpg?1364583315"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>As you can see from the image above, when the Dizmio wallet opens it forms a ""V"" shape. The ""V"" shape helps keep the cards from falling out the bottom and it also helps push the cards up to make them easier to grab &amp; sort through.</p>
<h1>Quick Card Organizer</h1>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/479/015/36ff0d995e2f4c7f70e66e7e5b98a110_large.jpg?1364583336"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>By placing your index finger at the top of the wallet &amp; thumb at the bottom of the wallet, you can quickly organize/ straighten your cards located inside the plates.</p>
<h1>Thumb Groove</h1>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/479/017/13d469c9fe77ac74364ee4a225046eda_large.jpg?1364583353"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>Located on the upper left corner on both sides of the Dizmio wallet is a curved thumb groove. The thumb groove allows for easy removal of the outside credit card.</p>
<h1>6061 Aircraft Grade Aluminum Plates</h1>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/479/018/36d35ba284a3f9b3b16d81dae05f5d31_large.jpg?1364583374"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>We chose aircraft grade aluminum 6061 for the Dizmio Wallet because it allowed us to create a wallet that was incredibly thin, light, and strong. The aluminum plate has grooves on the side which keeps the elastic strap in place.</p>
<p>Each Aluminum plate is 1mm thick (0.039 inch), and is very solid and extremely difficult to bend. The aluminum plates are anodized to protect against corrosion &amp; finger oil.</p>
<p><strong>Aluminum Production Steps:</strong></p>
<p>The aluminum plates undergo an intensive manufacturing process. First the aluminum plates are laser cut, they are then tumbled which helps smooth the edges, the aluminum after this is sand blasted, anodized, and lastly laser etched with our logo.</p>
<p>We have chosen a manufacture who upholds very high standards. We promise that none of the aluminum plates shipped will have any scratches or defects.</p>
<h1>Elastic Strap</h1>
<p>The Dizmio wallet has (1) one inch elastic strap. The elastic strap is composed of high quality rubber and polyester, which makes it machine washable.</p>
<p>The elastic strap is off-centered towards the bottom of the wallet. By placing the elastic strap closer to the bottom it makes the wallet easier to pull open from the top.</p>
<h1>Stop RFID Skimming Theft</h1>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/479/019/381562cef77f6522da4210df6deb365e_large.png?1364583398"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>The Dizmio Wallet is made from 6061 aircraft grade aluminum. This material is able to block &amp; interfere with RFID signals. Our wallet helps protect you from RFID skimming theft.</p>

Helps protects against RFID skimming theft (watch our video below)
Is very durable and lightweight
Dimensions
At its thinnest point the Dizmio wallet is only 2mm (0.079 inches) thick.
At the thickest point ( around the elastic strap) the Dizmio wallet is 6mm thick (0.24 inches).
The Design

We went through countless prototypes until we settled on a Design that we believe fits all of our goals. The Dizmio wallet has a unique shape with very specific and functional grooves. The shape of the Dizmio wallet provides a pleasant user experience.
The images that you see are of the Dizmio wallet that you will receive. All images show the final production model of the Dizmio wallet.
The Dizmio wallet is composed of two aluminum plates & one elastic strap.
Mix & Match aluminum plates
Display your personality through your Dizmio wallet. Create your own wallet by mixing different colored aluminum plates! 
* Choose any two aluminum plate colors you like!
The aluminum plate colors we are offering are Black, Clear, Blue, Orange, Red, & Green. 




With logo or without logo

There are two different pledges for the Dizmio wallet. 


Pledge With logo: In this pledge you will receive the Dizmio wallet with our laser etched logo that can be seen in the images. The laser etched logo also helps to provide a rough surface to keep the outside cards even more secure. 

Pledge with NO logo: This pledge option is for the pure minimalists. There is no logo on the wallet. 
 
 
The ""V"" Shape

As you can see from the image above, when the Dizmio wallet opens it forms a ""V"" shape. The ""V"" shape helps keep the cards from falling out the bottom and it also helps push the cards up to make them easier to grab & sort through.
Quick Card Organizer

By placing your index finger at the top of the wallet & thumb at the bottom of the wallet, you can quickly organize/ straighten your cards located inside the plates.
Thumb Groove

Located on the upper left corner on both sides of the Dizmio wallet is a curved thumb groove. The thumb groove allows for easy removal of the outside credit card.
6061 Aircraft Grade Aluminum Plates

We chose aircraft grade aluminum 6061 for the Dizmio Wallet because it allowed us to create a wallet that was incredibly thin, light, and strong. The aluminum plate has grooves on the side which keeps the elastic strap in place.
Each Aluminum plate is 1mm thick (0.039 inch), and is very solid and extremely difficult to bend. The aluminum plates are anodized to protect against corrosion & finger oil.
Aluminum Production Steps:
The aluminum plates undergo an intensive manufacturing process. First the aluminum plates are laser cut, they are then tumbled which helps smooth the edges, the aluminum after this is sand blasted, anodized, and lastly laser etched with our logo.
We have chosen a manufacture who upholds very high standards. We promise that none of the aluminum plates shipped will have any scratches or defects.
Elastic Strap
The Dizmio wallet has (1) one inch elastic strap. The elastic strap is composed of high quality rubber and polyester, which makes it machine washable.
The elastic strap is off-centered towards the bottom of the wallet. By placing the elastic strap closer to the bottom it makes the wallet easier to pull open from the top.
Stop RFID Skimming Theft

The Dizmio Wallet is made from 6061 aircraft grade aluminum. This material is able to block & interfere with RFID signals. Our wallet helps protect you from RFID skimming theft.

The large size was functional, as the pilot's needed to be able to read their timepiece with just a quick glance during flights. With an imposing diameter of 46mm, the 1983 XL stays true to these vintage pilot's watches.  </p><p>To ensure a sturdy build, we used 316L stainless steel to forge the casing. With a total height of 12mm and a weight of 108 grams, it feels and looks great on the wrist. The case has a brushed finish with a high polish on the edges, which gives it a more sophisticated look.</p><p>Protecting the face of the watch, you'll find scratch resistant sapphire glass. Coupled with the stainless steel case and screw-down crown, this combination gives the 1983 XL a water resistance of 10ATM (100m).</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534103905/rjepeoyqwnf4xefh9sbr.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534103919/mcuppi7pk3hv6ht4rzah.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534103960/vo8uvchz9gol8cghvepy.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>In the center of the dial is a large triangle at the 12 o'clock position.

The dial has been reduced to the bare essentials and made extremely easy to read. Also present on the dial is a date window at the 3 o'clock position and a 24-hour sub-dial to strengthen the military look.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534104024/r19w7vyecjc7l9osbvsu.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534104046/wprxfil7mzaxm5q0qx5w.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>In the pioneering days of aviation, pilots had to face the elements in unheated cockpits. The original Pilot's Watches had particularly large crowns that were easy to grip so that they could be set and wound by a pilot wearing thick gloves.</p><p>The 1983 XL Pilot is engineered with large screw-down crowns which are engraved with the number '83', to identify the model. In addition to controlling the date / time, the crown is also connected to a hand winding system that lets you charge the watch with just a few churns. The crown is unscrewed before being pulled out and rotated. This screw-down design offers the highest level protection against water and guarantees the wearer a superior water resistance.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534104114/zo3uxivyf4kna8bpprbn.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534104127/rnb7kcb20sc2fum4i3bw.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The 1983 XL Pilot comes equipped with a genuine leather strap with a black finish and black stitching. The 22mm wide strap, which has a thickness of 3mm, is soft and comfortable to wear and easy to put on. Instead of a traditional buckle, we chose to pair the strap with a stainless steel, butterfly deployment clasp (with push buttons). The clasp has a polished finish and has been laser etched with the 'Kingsbury' logo.</p><p>There are a several advantages to using such a clasp: They're easy to put on and remove. They don't cause as much creasing and wear in the leather. They're stylish and add more flair to your timepiece.

Thus, no pilot's watch would be complete without some sort of luminous features and the 1983 XL Pilot is no exception.  </p><p>For our design, we chose to add Super-Luminova BGW9 which is appears white under normal and glows blue during low light conditions (when charged). The striking luminescent hands make it easy to tell time even in the dark, a feature that lasts for hours. To further aide in reading the dial in the dark, we've added Super-Lume beads (also BGW9) on top of every hour marking, which is not only functional, but gives the watch a unique glowing design.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534104234/k0qvhbx1uyewlaqbggyb.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534104275/twef2dnjh5qx80mrwes4.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The caseback on the 1983 XL Pilot is constructed from 316L stainless steel and has a screw-down design allowing for the tightest fit and best protection against water.

This timepiece, with an impressive diameter of 46mm, offers a modern take on a vintage classic.The watch, which is powered by a Miyota 21-jewel automatic movement, features a 24 hour sub-dial, date and hand winding option. As on the famous models of the past, the dial is decorated with bold, easy to read numerals and propeller-like hands which further underscores the heritage character of this timekeeper.This is going to be a limited edition watch, we will produce no more than 200 units and then retire the design forever, so make sure to reserve yours now! Our latest design draws its inspiration from aviation, to create a reimagined classic. The matte black face, 24 hour sub-dial and luminous markings draw on elements of some of the great pilot watches of the past. Yet the bold numerals, black leather strap (with deployment clasp), and contemporary detailing on the stainless steel case sets this timepiece firmly in the future.  Beginning in the late 30's and through WWII, a number of manufacturers started to produce large oversized watches to be supplied to Air Force pilots. The large size was functional, as the pilot's needed to be able to read their timepiece with just a quick glance during flights. With an imposing diameter of 46mm, the 1983 XL stays true to these vintage pilot's watches.  To ensure a sturdy build, we used 316L stainless steel to forge the casing. With a total height of 12mm and a weight of 108 grams, it feels and looks great on the wrist. The case has a brushed finish with a high polish on the edges, which gives it a more sophisticated look.Protecting the face of the watch, you'll find scratch resistant sapphire glass. Coupled with the stainless steel case and screw-down crown, this combination gives the 1983 XL a water resistance of 10ATM (100m). In the center of the dial is a large triangle at the 12 o'clock position. This feature has been a mainstay since the pilot watch was first introduced. It allows pilots in the cockpit to instantly recognize the position of the hands.The black dials of cockpit instruments with their contrasting, luminescent displays has been the inspiration for the design of pilot's watches for decades and the 1983 XL is no exception. The dial has been reduced to the bare essentials and made extremely easy to read. Also present on the dial is a date window at the 3 o'clock position and a 24-hour sub-dial to strengthen the military look. In the pioneering days of aviation, pilots had to face the elements in unheated cockpits. The original Pilot's Watches had particularly large crowns that were easy to grip so that they could be set and wound by a pilot wearing thick gloves.The 1983 XL Pilot is engineered with large screw-down crowns which are engraved with the number '83', to identify the model. In addition to controlling the date / time, the crown is also connected to a hand winding system that lets you charge the watch with just a few churns. The crown is unscrewed before being pulled out and rotated. This screw-down design offers the highest level protection against water and guarantees the wearer a superior water resistance. The 1983 XL Pilot comes equipped with a genuine leather strap with a black finish and black stitching. The 22mm wide strap, which has a thickness of 3mm, is soft and comfortable to wear and easy to put on. Instead of a traditional buckle, we chose to pair the strap with a stainless steel, butterfly deployment clasp (with push buttons). The clasp has a polished finish and has been laser etched with the 'Kingsbury' logo.There are a several advantages to using such a clasp: They're easy to put on and remove. They don't cause as much creasing and wear in the leather. They're stylish and add more flair to your timepiece. They're more secure as they lock in 2 positions rather than one. For decades Pilot's Watches borrowed their design from the glowing cockpit instruments of aircraft. Thus, no pilot's watch would be complete without some sort of luminous features and the 1983 XL Pilot is no exception.  For our design, we chose to add Super-Luminova BGW9 which is appears white under normal and glows blue during low light conditions (when charged). The striking luminescent hands make it easy to tell time even in the dark, a feature that lasts for hours. To further aide in reading the dial in the dark, we've added Super-Lume beads (also BGW9) on top of every hour marking, which is not only functional, but gives the watch a unique glowing design.  The caseback on the 1983 XL Pilot is constructed from 316L stainless steel and has a screw-down design allowing for the tightest fit and best protection against water. Each case has been engraved with the Make / Model as well as the indication that this watch is a limited release of only 200 units.Featured prominently in the center of the caseback, is an engraved P-51 Mustang, an American fighter plane made famous during WWII. It was a must that we use an automatic movement to power the 1983 XL Pilot. We wanted something robust and reliable, which is why we settled on the Miyota Calibre 8217. It's an upgrade from the popular 8215 series in both mechanics as well as decoration.The 8217 is a Japanese movement manufactured by Citizen. It’s a great movement that provide accuracy, dependability, and longevity that is used by several watch makers worldwide. This is a 3-hand automatic date movement and has a 24-hour indicator at 9 o’clock position.The 8217 employ a ball bearing unidirectional winding rotor that winds the mainspring which stores energy and transfers it through a series of gears and springs, regulating the release of energy to power the watch. The movement runs at 21,600 BPH or 6 beats per second and has about 40 hour power reserve. In addition, it has 21 Jewels to help keep the movement running efficiently. Each watch comes in a high quality, luxury wooden box with a glossy black finish. Inside, the box is lined with a smooth crimson PU leather interior, which really shows off the timepiece.   Kingsbury offers a limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship for a period of One (1) year after original purchase from Kingsbury Watch Co.This means that if the components or materials of your watch have any issues, or if the watch isn’t functioning correctly, we’ll repair or replace it (at our discretion). We don't cover normal wear and tear, broken or damaged crystal, watch case, strap, bracelet and loss or theft. You will void your warranty if you open the caseback, or forget to screw down or push in the crown and expose the internal components of your watch to moisture.Proof of purchase is required for all warranty claims and service requests, so hold onto your unique serial dog tag, this is the ID for your warranty. Kingsbury will not accept a warranty claim or repair request if a watch has evidence of excessive wear or misuse.  Risks and challengesOnce the funding is in place, the challenge will be producing the watches in a large scale. Since we're already passed the prototype phase and have all the sourcing completed, we don't anticipate any major setbacks.We are fully capable of handling any issues that might arise as our team has previous experience sourcing and manufacturing products. This is also our second Kickstarter project, our first was a success and our backers told us time and again how well we had managed the project. We will be transparent with backers throughout the process, and will give frequent updates and answer any questions that arise.We are confident in our manufacturing and our quality control and believe strongly that we'll once again be able to meet all of our shipping targets.",27.0,0,"2 Campaigns

</div><div><h3></h3></div><h3>Our
Vision</h3>
<p>At Transcendent, our vision is to
empower and enrich individuals of all walks of life in their journey of
transcendence toward happiness and prosperity.</p>
<p>We seek to advocate the mastery and
elevation of the Body, Mind, and Soul through focused discipline, ardent
hard-work, audacious drive and the overcoming of adversity.  </p>
<p>Remember, we are infinite beings,
interconnected with the universe. We have complete dominion over our lives and
boundless potential for greatness.</p>
<p>At the moment, we seek to spread our
vision through the embodiment of a clothing company, a simple and subtle method
of delivery. In equal, we seek to be an accessible source of reliable and
aesthetic apparel. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457482075/n9mgsd8uyqascmexy7ht.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<h3><br/></h3><h3>Quality and Durability</h3>
<p><span>A prominent focus of our brand is quality and
durability.<span> That
is why we proposed that all our clothing be crafted from 100% Heavy Blend
Cotton. Providing optimal resilience to
wear and tear, Transcendent fabrics
will last you through you
toughest endeavors.<br/>
</span></span></p><p><span><span>Moreover, often
overlooked, cotton has an array of positive traits. On top of having a high
tensile strength, cotton has great moisture control and also serves well as a
thermal insulator. Cotton is also a very sustainable and natural fabric source.<br/>
<br/>
Building upon the
focus of durability and quality, all our apparel will be screen printed. This
process entails a multi-station machine
and a screen with our design stencil where ink flows through the open areas to
create the image. Screen printing produces a crisp image that is resilient to
wear and tear, aiding in the longevity of the clothing. </span></span></p><p><span><span></span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457466495/kl3pnijjpvnmegkyfymd.png"" src="""" style=""width: 613.564px;height: 286px;""/></p><p></p><p><span><span></span></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">Where does your Money go?</span><br/></p>
<p>The funding collected through this campaign will
contribute completely to the launching of our brand. This entails the purchase
of various business licencing, initial production and printing, websites and
other promotion platforms. </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Currently, as we are still premature in the start-up,
we will be facing many many challenges. But in all honestly, I know that with
our passionate and diligent creators and developers we will find a way to

Our
Vision
At Transcendent, our vision is to
empower and enrich individuals of all walks of life in their journey of
transcendence toward happiness and prosperity.
We seek to advocate the mastery and
elevation of the Body, Mind, and Soul through focused discipline, ardent
hard-work, audacious drive and the overcoming of adversity.  
Remember, we are infinite beings,
interconnected with the universe. We have complete dominion over our lives and
boundless potential for greatness.
At the moment, we seek to spread our
vision through the embodiment of a clothing company, a simple and subtle method
of delivery. In equal, we seek to be an accessible source of reliable and
aesthetic apparel. 
Quality and Durability
A prominent focus of our brand is quality and
durability. That
is why we proposed that all our clothing be crafted from 100% Heavy Blend
Cotton. Providing optimal resilience to
wear and tear, Transcendent fabrics
will last you through you
toughest endeavors.
Moreover, often
overlooked, cotton has an array of positive traits. On top of having a high
tensile strength, cotton has great moisture control and also serves well as a
thermal insulator. Cotton is also a very sustainable and natural fabric source.

Building upon the
focus of durability and quality, all our apparel will be screen printed. This
process entails a multi-station machine
and a screen with our design stencil where ink flows through the open areas to
create the image. Screen printing produces a crisp image that is resilient to
wear and tear, aiding in the longevity of the clothing. Where does your Money go?
The funding collected through this campaign will
contribute completely to the launching of our brand. This entails the purchase
of various business licencing, initial production and printing, websites and
other promotion platforms. 
Risks & Challenges
Currently, as we are still premature in the start-up,
we will be facing many many challenges. But in all honestly, I know that with
our passionate and diligent creators and developers we will find a way to
overcome these tribulations. I have complete faith in this project, we will
only continue to learn and grow through the progression of our brandSpread the Word
If for whatever reason you cannot
contribute, you can still help us by simply spreading the word. Ultimately, we
are seeking to gather in people who believe and share the same vision as us.
Together with your support, we can look great, cultivate wisdom and transcend
our reality. FACEBOOK (Copy & Paste)

<h3>Introducing The World's First Customizable Anchor Bracelet </h3>
<p>As avid bracelet users our team sought out to create something unique. Our passion for accessories led us to create a product that could potentially disrupt an industry. Never before have it been this easy to match a stylish accessory with <strong>ANY outfit</strong>. We got frustrated having to buy dozen of bracelets and would still struggle to match our unique styles - it's both expensive and inconvenient. We have spent the past year working with leading manufacturers to come up with an affordable, stylish and functional bracelet that we believe would suit anyone. <strong>Men, women and kids 4+</strong> (just switch to a bigger size band as they grow.)</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Designing this first collection of bracelets, we made sure of THREE things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a luxurious stylish anchor that look and feel exclusive.</li>
<li>To use the best possible quality to create a product that will stand the test of time </li>
<li>To create a way to change colors and styles within seconds to fit any style or outfit.</li>

<p><strong>Designing this product,</strong> our goal was to emphasize the user of today, a truly individual person who likes to express emotions through fashion. A great design that is timeless and unisex. </p>

Lenzindex is an incredibly versatile and fully customizable indexing system for the rear cap of your precious lenses, with unique features: 

Any number at any size! Really! Try us...

Economy / Ecology. Just stick it on top of your cap.

Practicality. Grab the lens you want in the blink of an eye!

Durability. Made from one piece solid plastic.

Style. If you gonna do it, do it right! 
Lenzindex. Index your lenses with style!
You name it, we make it!We can make indexes for any mount and any lens. But, as you can see below, the combinations of focal lengths and cap sizes are endless. So, we need a little help from you to organize our production process. Before you get your perks, take 1 minute and follow the link below to state your camera mount. This is the first step that will give us valuable feedback of the market share. The second step, for the details of your order, will be ready in a few days, Then, all of you will be notified and asked to fill it and it will be forwarded to our production team.
Help us build a database!
How much?It costs ""nothing"" compared to the easiness it gives you in organizing and choosing quickly your invaluable lenses. You keep your old cap and you can reposition it in case you change mount or lens. Types of LenzindexStandardNo matter what mount you have, if you don't want any special indexing, standard version covers all your needs.CustomIf you have, let's say, two equal lenses with different aperture or you want to specify the macro one, choose the Custom Design perk and give us the details in the order form.BrandedUse Lenzindex to promote your shop or lens repair house and offer your clients a useful gift. Let us design it or send us a B/W vector file and we'll make it for you!Feel free to contact us through indiegogo for any questions or requests.AlternativeIn some cases we might propose a different design. I.e. the Arri lenses have a very small place to stick the index. We thought of inverting the colors and make it negative, white circle with black engraved numbers. We'll get back to it when we receive the first orders and find out about the market share.How to order...

Whether you roam cities or mountains, you often need more than a smartphone to get through the day. The real world requires real tools, but tools are not meant to share your pocket with a smartphone.  We wanted a sleek, multi-functional too that could be conveniently carried with your smartphone to give you everything you need in one pocket to support your active lifestyle, so we made the ToolCase.The ToolCase is the first case to feature a fully functional, detachable MultiTool. Our MultiTool is also the first to combine the functionality of a folding tool with the low profile of a card tool. This keeps the ToolCase sleek while still packing over 25 functions in an area slightly larger than a credit card. The MultiTool cleanly separates from the case to be used like a real tool and it snaps back on when the job is done. What We NeedWe are asking $25 thousand to help us invest in tooling and to meet our manufacturer's minimum order quantity. What You GetWe are offering the ToolCase for the iPhone 5s/5 and 4s/4. We are also offering the MultiTool separately for anyone simply looking for the latest and most innovative multi-tool available. If we don't reach our goal, we will return your pledge so their is no risk of contributing without a reward.Quality, Design, and ExperienceWe use quality materials (ballistic grade polycarbonate with soft-touch scratch resistant silicone overlay, stainless steel, and aircraft aluminum), precise engineering, and follow a minimalist Scandinavian design principle where form fits function. Every line and curve serves a purpose.Members of our team have a designed gear for major companies including Victorinox and Oceanic Worldwide. We have finished our design and prototyping and have an established relationship with a quality manufacturer that is already producing our popular CargoCase, so we are ready to go.Our CommitmentWe are committed to making the highest quality products and will strive to deliver your perks on schedule. While there is always some risk of setbacks during the tooling and first run of manufacturing, we are confident that we will be able to ship our rewards on time or even ahead of schedule. We will not wait for our campaign period to end before starting the tooling process. To get a head start, we will begin as soon as we reach our goal. If we don't reach our goal, we will return your donation so there is no risk of making a pledge without a reward.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you can't contribute, that's OK. If you like what we're doing and want to help, you can let your family, friends, and co-works about our campaign - and be sure to use the Indiegogo share tools. We also value your thoughts and opinions.

<p>WALTER is the creative vomit that has been bubbling in the bellies of my friends and I for a good deal of time. We love shoes! But you practically have to risk your life trying to find a descent looking pair of shoes in this day and age. How many times have you walked into a shoe store, looked around, scanning the shelves up and down until your eyes feel like their burning inside your skull, only to turn around and walk away hoping that somewhere in this world that perfect set of footwear is waiting for you to sweep them out of their cold cardboard box and run away with (in) them. Or maybe you found that pair of shoes but theres no way your paying a cajillion dollars for a pair of paper-thin slip-ons.</p>
<p>Well...we feel for ya. So much so, that we're working our dairy-airs off to provide you with a SOLUTION! WALTERs are just the beginning of what we hope will become the easiest and most effective way to shop for high quality, low priced footwear (what a concept!). Our goal is to bring you only the shoes you want. You should be trying to figure out which shoes NOT to buy! Well...help us...help you. Claim your kicks NOW! Or sooner if necassary! Three and a half minutes ago!</p>

<p>Compassion International Tanzania has been working since 1999 in its efforts to see children released from poverty in Jesus’ Name.  Currently Compassion International is working in 12 Tanzanian mainland regions. The total number of children supported reaches 64,558 in the Child Development Sponsorship Program and 1,113 mother and child units, and 1,050 children in the Child Survival Program.</p>
<p>Children in rural Tanzania have to walk long distance to gather water.  This water is often not safe to drink – giving children diseases like cholera and dysentery.  A Sawyer water filter is set up in five minutes, but removes all harmful bacteria that could put a child’s life at risk.  Compassion Tanzania has decided to take deliberate efforts to ensure every Compassion child and their household has access to safe and clean water.  Clean water and sanitation have profound bearing on health, human dignity and economic growth.</p>
<p>The overall objective of providing water filters is to reduce morbidity and mortality among children and babies related to water borne disease resulted from untreated drinking water.  The water filters will affect 103 implementing church partners in the Northern base of Tanzania. </p>

<p><b>Have you been looking for the perfect belt for a long time?</b> </p>
<p><b>I bet you have, haven’t you?!</b> </p>
<p>Have you always wanted something more from your belt, maybe a particular color, the right buckle to suit your clothes, the right color thread, the exact size you need, the desired width, the right number of holes, so that there is no need for you to find ways to make new ones? Maybe you wanted the leather to be soft and pleasant to the touch? And of course you want your belt to be light and to draw everyone’s attention.</p>
<p><b>I’m Donna Anaine and I will help you create your perfect belt.</b></p>
<p>All our belts are made of the softest and the best quality full grain Italian leather, hand sewn as per your desired choices.</p>
<p>The thread we use is 1mm thick and it is treated with beeswax so that dirt won’t stick to it and withstands the test of time. This particular thread gives each belt created by Donna Anaine a lifetime warranty.</p>
<p>Each belt created is handmade by one of our skilled workers. The hand sewing takes about 2 hours. In total, the approximate working time for each of our belts is 3 to 4 hours.</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>Our team is made of experienced workers and each member has been working in the leather goods manufacturing field for at least 9 years. We are accustomed to delivery deadlines and large production quantities.</p>
<p>All our belts are handmade and hand sewn and for this reason, in case of large orders we will need additional skilled workers to help us. Although, orders might be above our estimates this shall not delay in any way the delivery schedule.</p>
<p>In the worse case scenario, the Italian leather supply process could encounter delays due to reasons beyond our control, but this could only mean a customer delivery delay of 2-3 weeks.</p>
<br/>
</div></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Have you been looking for the perfect belt for a long time? 
I bet you have, haven’t you?! 
Have you always wanted something more from your belt, maybe a particular color, the right buckle to suit your clothes, the right color thread, the exact size you need, the desired width, the right number of holes, so that there is no need for you to find ways to make new ones? Maybe you wanted the leather to be soft and pleasant to the touch? And of course you want your belt to be light and to draw everyone’s attention.
I’m Donna Anaine and I will help you create your perfect belt.
All our belts are made of the softest and the best quality full grain Italian leather, hand sewn as per your desired choices.
The thread we use is 1mm thick and it is treated with beeswax so that dirt won’t stick to it and withstands the test of time. This particular thread gives each belt created by Donna Anaine a lifetime warranty.
Each belt created is handmade by one of our skilled workers. The hand sewing takes about 2 hours. In total, the approximate working time for each of our belts is 3 to 4 hours.



Other fashion brands guess what their customers want – we let YOU decide!
Choose from 7 possibilities to customize your dream leather belt:

The desired length, measured at waist: 24” to 50” (61cm to 127cm);
The desired leather color: chose from 3 colors: black, white, brown;
The desired width: 1” (2.54cm), 1.18” (3cm), 1.5” (3.8cm);
The desired thread color to be used for your belt: white, black, red, yellow;
The desired belt buckle from 3 models: nickel, anti brass and dull nickel;
The desired number of holes;
The desired belt edge: natural or dyed in white, black or brown;

Delivered to you at wholesale price!
If you purchased our belt at a retailer, you would pay $99. We’ll sell them directly to you with 50% discount for $49 belt + $15 shipping.



4 Thread Colors:



3 Buckle models and 6 belt edge finishes:

<p>The problem with spam is that it is so easy to send a lot of it, and you only need a few fools to buy your stuff to make a buck. The economics are in the spammers favor. For less than $10 you can spam 40 million email addresses. The odds might only be one in a million, but that’s good enough for a spammer.</p>
<p>Over the past few decades we have been focusing on better filters, on understanding and in building smarter servers and routers to keep spam from ending up in your inbox. But the fact of the matter is that as we get smarter about filtering spam, spammers get better at reaching more of us, for less money. The economics are still in the spammers favor.</p>
<p><strong>The Economics of Spam</strong></p>
<p>Now imagine the following scenario: imagine if a spammer would send out 40 million emails, and instead of getting 40 orders,he or she would receive a million faulty orders. It isn’t economically viable to read through one million orders to find the 40 valid orders. Even with 4000 faulty orders I wonder if the numers are still attractive for spammers.</p>
<p><strong>So why don’t we do this?</strong></p>
<p>What would happen if a large portion of us would donate something like $5 a year for an international spam fighting team. I’ll bet we can find a million people around the world who want to pay $5 for the pleasure of knowing that a team of people are fighting back against spam. This team could do two things. First of all it could hire people, through <a href=""https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Amazon’s mechanical turk</a> program to place fake orders on spammed urls. As a member I could forward all or some of my spam and it would all be collected in a huge spam box at this organization. Random emails could be submitted to mechanical turk so that our little army of spam fighters can visit these websites and start placing fake orders. It would be hilarious, and effective.</p>
<p><strong>There is more...</strong></p>
<p>The second thing I would love to see is an automated script to keep spammers busy. I even got a domain name ready for it: procurement-office.com<br/>Besides the obvious spam messages selling me penis enlargement pills or Viagra I also get the occasional Nigerian 419 scams or Asian offers for random stuff. I would love to be able to reply to these people with the following message:</p>
<p>“Hey thanks! That’s exactly what we were looking for. Unfortunately this is my last day here but my buddy Mike at procurement has just received a budget of 90,000 to start acquiring stuff and is eagerly awaiting your email. You can reach him at mike.johnsen@procurement-office.com”</p>
<p>I can totally imagine these spammers freaking out and thinking this is going to be the best day ever! They email ‘Mike’ and get an auto-reply. Something like this:</p>
<p>“Hi there, this is Mike at procurement. I’m off for the week visiting trade shows buying stuff but would love to talk to you about whatever you are selling. Please fill out th attached form and mail it back to me at your earliest convenience”</p>
<p>The attached PDF is of course 40 pages long and contains 600 forms that need to be filled out. Once they send that back there will be another step in the process. Maybe the form has been lost and a new form needs to be filled out. Maybe Mike will transfer the order to someone else up the chain (how about ‘Cindy’) that has an even bigger budget, and more form to fill out.</p>
<p><strong>How much fun would it be?</strong></p>
<p>The procurement-office.com would have to look good and would have a secret entrance somewhere for people who know what’s going on. I can see a dashboard there with how many people are going through the scripted responses and who got the farthest. It would be hilarious to see the threads of email from spammers and scammers replying to pre-formatted emails and complaining about their lost time but still continuing through the process.</p>
<p>And of course every minute they spend talking to ‘Mike’ is time they can’t spend spamming other people.</p>
<p>To wrap things up; these thing are both easy to do. Technically it isn’t very challenging. It is just a lot of work to set up.</p>
<p><strong>How much money do we need?</strong></p>
<p>Fortunately there is such a thing as crowdfunding. If spam still is an issue, and you dislike it enough, why not plegde a few dollars? If enough people dislike spam enough, we should be able to raise a substantial amount of money, hire an awesome team of developers and designers and start fighting back.</p>
<p>It is a simple plan, but simple plans often just work.</p></div>","My crazy idea to piss off spammers

<br/><br/><h4>WHY DO WE NEED YOUR HELP?
</h4>Running a growing farm is expensive. We are fortunate that the farm is already a sustainable business, but that is only a small part of our mission. We want to share our farm with more people. We want to give others the chance to experience the lifestyle of sustainable, rural living. While we could go to the bank or an investor, we believe that people like you want to support projects like us. We want to avoid debt or giving away large portions of our business. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1134677/files/20150106085153-13901411660_25054f788d_z.jpg?1420563113"" src="""" style=""""/></p>So, we are turning to the power of social media and crowdfunding. We are offering you the chance to play your part in the building of Highland Heights. We are not just asking for your money offering nothing in return. We know we have some great perks for you! Your money will front the costs of building three yurts and getting our doors open. People will be able to stay on our farm and experience the wonderful lifestyle of running a small family farm for years to come!<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1136637/files/20150107105810-13901383940_7a410e7180_z.jpg?1420657090"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Quite honestly, we were hoping to stash away enough cash over the next few years to self-fund the yurts, but in order to do that it would take us 10 years working multiple jobs and facing burn out before we ever arrived. Early in 2014, we gathered some trusted friends and colleagues around us and shared our dream of opening Highland Heights to the public as a B&amp;B. Everyone came back and said the same thing: “Get the funding. Do it now. Don’t wait.” We took them at their word and here we are.<br/><br/><h4>A NOTE ABOUT TRUST.</h4>With all crowdfunding ventures, there needs to be some reassurance that investments are trustworthy and legitimate. How do you know that we won't use the money to take our whole staff to Octoberfest for ""team-building?"" And how do you know the rewards will be honored?
<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1136662/files/20150107111821-14082005612_8639ca2432_z.jpg?1420658301"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>We have built our farm from the ground up out of nothing which isn’t easy these days. Our partnership with Purdue University and Clinton County Extension office signifies we are part of the community, and we're not going anywhere. We have an award-winning team that has helped us get here, and we've got a solid plan for moving forward. 

<br/><br/><h4>The money plan.</h4>Let's get to the good stuff: how will we be spending the money? Well, here are the plans so far.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1158683/files/20150119041955-honey-graphic.jpg?1421669995"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><br/><h4>Other Ways You Can Help</h4>

So, we are turning to the power of social media and crowdfunding. We are offering you the chance to play your part in the building of Highland Heights. We are not just asking for your money offering nothing in return. We know we have some great perks for you! Your money will front the costs of building three yurts and getting our doors open. People will be able to stay on our farm and experience the wonderful lifestyle of running a small family farm for years to come!Quite honestly, we were hoping to stash away enough cash over the next few years to self-fund the yurts, but in order to do that it would take us 10 years working multiple jobs and facing burn out before we ever arrived. Early in 2014, we gathered some trusted friends and colleagues around us and shared our dream of opening Highland Heights to the public as a B&B. Everyone came back and said the same thing: “Get the funding. Do it now. Don’t wait.” We took them at their word and here we are.A NOTE ABOUT TRUST.With all crowdfunding ventures, there needs to be some reassurance that investments are trustworthy and legitimate. How do you know that we won't use the money to take our whole staff to Octoberfest for ""team-building?"" And how do you know the rewards will be honored?
We have built our farm from the ground up out of nothing which isn’t easy these days. Our partnership with Purdue University and Clinton County Extension office signifies we are part of the community, and we're not going anywhere. We have an award-winning team that has helped us get here, and we've got a solid plan for moving forward. 

The money plan.Let's get to the good stuff: how will we be spending the money? Well, here are the plans so far.Other Ways You Can Help

<p>Made of ceramics and natural silicone, this product will make every cup a real emotional and comforting experience down to the last drop!</p>
<p>Appreciate the flavor and pleasure without the hassle of drinking an over hot beverage in non user-friendly containers.</p>
<p>Use it every day, everywhere, at home,the office, or on the road. vertiGOmug fits in car cup holders and you can refill it at your preferred coffee shop.</p>
<p>As product designers, we are constantly looking for problems or challenges to be solve. The issues of drinking hot beverages took a lot of innovate thinking.</p>
<h2>Pain points:</h2>
<p>We have all been scalded by that first sip of too hot coffee, hot chocolate, tea at some time or other!</p>
<p>If you’re like us, drinking coffee from a paper cup or plastic mug is like drinking wine in a foam glass!!!</p>
<p>What a disgusting way to enjoy pleasures of a great coffee taste! You can wait ages for the coffee to be drinkable, then before you know it, it's cold and only good for the sink! What a waste!!!</p>
<p>Mugs and tumblers made of plastics give of toxic vapors when subjected to high temperatures, everyone knows that, right?</p>
<p>Don't be sorry! Billions of paper cups end up in landfill each year because they cannot be recycled.</p>
<h2>vertiGOmug, a must have solution:</h2>
<p>Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could just take 1 or 2 sips at the perfect temperature while the rest of it stays hot, for longer?</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be great if we could always can put our lips on the soft and comforting texture of glass or ceramics?</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be really cool to get all those things while being environmental friendly, and using food safe materials?</p>
<p>As product designers, we always keep an open mind, using creativity to solve every day needs, providing solutions that improve people's life, we think you deserve it!</p>

<p>Made of ceramics and natural silicone, vertiGOmug is a 12oz (375ml) double wall insulated mug that keeps beverages hot.</p>
<p>You will always feel the luxury of ceramic on lips when drinking.</p>
<p>Drink from our innovative ceramic lid that cools liquids to the temperature you want in seconds, 1 or 2 sips at the time while the remaining beverage is kept hot in the insulated area. You can also remove the top and drink directly from the cup.</p>
<p>Oh! and the sealing lid prevents accidental spills. Isn't that wonderful too!?!</p>

<h2>How does vertiGOmug work?</h2>
<p>It way it works is very simple, but very cleverly to.</p>
<p>As you saw in the video with our fully functional prototype, you fill the mug with your favorite hot beverage and then put the lid on just like a regular mug or tumbler.</p>
<p>The difference and big advantage is that you don't need to wait for the entire volume to cool before drinking: You push the side button in, this pumps a sip into the cooling zone in the lid.</p>
<p>Simply wait for that sip to cool down to the desired temperature and drink. This operation takes approximately 10 seconds depending of liquid and ambient air temperatures. It may take up to 60 seconds if the liquid is at boiling temperature.</p>

<p>Faite de céramique et de silicone naturel, verti<strong>GO</strong>mug fera de chaque breuvage une véritable expérience émotionnelle et réconfortante de la première gorgée à la dernière goutte!</p>
<p>Appréciez la saveur et le plaisir sans les tracas de boire une boisson chaude à même les contenants non conviviaux qui vous brûle la bouche dès la première gorgée.</p>
<p>Utilisez-la à tous les jours, partout, à la maison, au bureau ou sur la route. verti<strong>GO</strong>mug convient aux porte-gobelets des véhicules et vous pouvez en faire le plein chez votre commerçant de café préféré.</p>
<p><strong>Points de douleurs:</strong></p>
<p>Nous avons tous été brûlés par cette première gorgée trop chaude de café, de chocolat chaud ou de thé à un moment ou à un autre!</p>
<p>Si vous êtes comme nous, vous détestez boire du café dans une tasse de papier ou une tasse en plastique, c'est comme boire du vin dans un verre en styromousse! Quelle manière désagréable de savourer les plaisirs de la vie!</p>
<p>il faut attendre des lustres pour un café prêt à boire, puis surprise, avant même de le réaliser, il est trop froid et seulement bon pour l'évier! Quel gâchis!</p>
<p>Les tasses et les gobelets en plastique émanent des vapeurs toxiques lorsqu'ils sont soumis à des températures élevés, tout le monde sait ça, n'est-ce pas?</p>
<p>Ne participez plus à ce désastre: Des milliards de gobelets en papier finissent dans la nature chaque année parce qu'ils ne peuvent pas être recyclés!</p>
<p><strong>vertiGOmug, un must à vous procurer absolument:</strong></p>
<p>Ne serait-il pas merveilleux si nous pouvions obtenir quelques gorgées à la température idéale pendant que le reste du breuvage se conserve au chaud dans une réserve isolée?</p>
<p>Ne serait-il pas merveilleux si nous pouvions toujours appuyer nos lèvres contre la texture douce et réconfortante de la céramique?</p>
<p>Ne serait-il pas idéal d'obtenir toutes ces choses, tout en étant respectueux de l'environnement et en utilisant des matériaux approuvés pour les aliments?</p>

<p>Fait de céramique et de silicone naturel, verti<strong>GO</strong>mug est une tasse de 12oz (375ml) à double paroi isolée qui garde les boissons chaudes plus longtemps que ses acolytes.</p>
<p><br/>Vous ressentirez toujours le lux et le réconfort de la céramique sur vos lèvres en buvant.</p>
<p><br/>Buvez directement du couvercle innovateur en céramique qui refroidit les liquides à la température que vous désirez en quelques secondes seulement, 1 ou 2 gorgées à la fois tandis que la boisson reste bien au chaud dans la réserve isolée.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Vous pouvez également boire directement à la tasse en retirant simplement le couvercle.</p>
<p><br/>Ah oui! Et le couvercle étanche empêche également les déversements accidentels. N'est-ce pas merveilleux!?!</p>

<p>Vue schématique du modèle WO en format ''Solo''</p>
<p><strong>Comment fonctionne vertiGOmug?</strong></p>
<p>son fonctionnement est très simple et son mécanisme est précis.</p>
<p>Comme vous l'avez probablement observé dans la vidéo démontrant notre prototype fonctionnel, il suffit de remplir votre verti<strong>GO</strong>mug de votre boisson chaude préférée, puis simplement installer le couvercle innovateur.</p>
<p><br/>La différence et surtout l'avantage est que vous n'avez pas besoin d'attendre que la totalité du volume liquide refroidisse avant de commencer à boire: Vous appuyez sur le bouton latéral qui pompe une gorgée de liquide dans la zone de refroidissement, sur le dessus du couvercle.</p>
<p><br/>Attendez simplement que le liquide chaud se retrouvant dans la zone de refroidissement ait atteint la température désirée et buvez.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Cette opération prend environ 10 secondes en fonction de la température du liquide et de la température ambiante. Cela peut prendre jusqu'à 60 secondes si le liquide est à la température d'ébullition de 100 degrés Celcius.</p>

Schematic view of BB & WW Duetto
 
Made of ceramics and natural silicone, this product will make every cup a real emotional and comforting experience down to the last drop!
Appreciate the flavor and pleasure without the hassle of drinking an over hot beverage in non user-friendly containers.
Use it every day, everywhere, at home,the office, or on the road. vertiGOmug fits in car cup holders and you can refill it at your preferred coffee shop.
As product designers, we are constantly looking for problems or challenges to be solve. The issues of drinking hot beverages took a lot of innovate thinking.
Pain points:
We have all been scalded by that first sip of too hot coffee, hot chocolate, tea at some time or other!
If you’re like us, drinking coffee from a paper cup or plastic mug is like drinking wine in a foam glass!!!
What a disgusting way to enjoy pleasures of a great coffee taste! You can wait ages for the coffee to be drinkable, then before you know it, it's cold and only good for the sink! What a waste!!!
Mugs and tumblers made of plastics give of toxic vapors when subjected to high temperatures, everyone knows that, right?
Don't be sorry! Billions of paper cups end up in landfill each year because they cannot be recycled.
vertiGOmug, a must have solution:
Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could just take 1 or 2 sips at the perfect temperature while the rest of it stays hot, for longer?
Wouldn't it be great if we could always can put our lips on the soft and comforting texture of glass or ceramics?
Wouldn't it be really cool to get all those things while being environmental friendly, and using food safe materials?
As product designers, we always keep an open mind, using creativity to solve every day needs, providing solutions that improve people's life, we think you deserve it!

Schematic view of BW & WB Duetto
Made of ceramics and natural silicone, vertiGOmug is a 12oz (375ml) double wall insulated mug that keeps beverages hot.
You will always feel the luxury of ceramic on lips when drinking.
Drink from our innovative ceramic lid that cools liquids to the temperature you want in seconds, 1 or 2 sips at the time while the remaining beverage is kept hot in the insulated area. You can also remove the top and drink directly from the cup.
Oh! and the sealing lid prevents accidental spills. Isn't that wonderful too!?!

How does vertiGOmug work?
It way it works is very simple, but very cleverly to.
As you saw in the video with our fully functional prototype, you fill the mug with your favorite hot beverage and then put the lid on just like a regular mug or tumbler.
The difference and big advantage is that you don't need to wait for the entire volume to cool before drinking: You push the side button in, this pumps a sip into the cooling zone in the lid.
Simply wait for that sip to cool down to the desired temperature and drink. This operation takes approximately 10 seconds depending of liquid and ambient air temperatures. It may take up to 60 seconds if the liquid is at boiling temperature.

No batteries, no complicated mechanisms, no hassle, easy to clean and dishwasher safe. Feel free to propose any optimizations, we are open to suggestion and who knows, we may add them before production.
Who are we?
Well, as you saw in the featured video, we are professional product designers. We have been involved in more than a hundred design projects.

VertiGOmug permet à son utilisateur de boire sans se brûler grâce à son système ingénieux qui propulse quelques gorgées à refroidir sur un plateau supérieur alors que la réserve isolée conserve le brevage chaud. 
VertiGOmug est une tasse tout simplement géniale au look incroyable qui fait de chaque gorgée l'éveil qui stimule vos sens. Le cadeau idéal pour l'être chère!
 
Vue schématique des modèles BB & WW en format ''Duetto''
Faite de céramique et de silicone naturel, vertiGOmug fera de chaque breuvage une véritable expérience émotionnelle et réconfortante de la première gorgée à la dernière goutte!
Appréciez la saveur et le plaisir sans les tracas de boire une boisson chaude à même les contenants non conviviaux qui vous brûle la bouche dès la première gorgée.
Utilisez-la à tous les jours, partout, à la maison, au bureau ou sur la route. vertiGOmug convient aux porte-gobelets des véhicules et vous pouvez en faire le plein chez votre commerçant de café préféré.
Points de douleurs:
Nous avons tous été brûlés par cette première gorgée trop chaude de café, de chocolat chaud ou de thé à un moment ou à un autre!
Si vous êtes comme nous, vous détestez boire du café dans une tasse de papier ou une tasse en plastique, c'est comme boire du vin dans un verre en styromousse! Quelle manière désagréable de savourer les plaisirs de la vie!
il faut attendre des lustres pour un café prêt à boire, puis surprise, avant même de le réaliser, il est trop froid et seulement bon pour l'évier! Quel gâchis!
Les tasses et les gobelets en plastique émanent des vapeurs toxiques lorsqu'ils sont soumis à des températures élevés, tout le monde sait ça, n'est-ce pas?
Ne participez plus à ce désastre: Des milliards de gobelets en papier finissent dans la nature chaque année parce qu'ils ne peuvent pas être recyclés!
vertiGOmug, un must à vous procurer absolument:
Ne serait-il pas merveilleux si nous pouvions obtenir quelques gorgées à la température idéale pendant que le reste du breuvage se conserve au chaud dans une réserve isolée?
Ne serait-il pas merveilleux si nous pouvions toujours appuyer nos lèvres contre la texture douce et réconfortante de la céramique?
Ne serait-il pas idéal d'obtenir toutes ces choses, tout en étant respectueux de l'environnement et en utilisant des matériaux approuvés pour les aliments?
En tant que concepteurs de produits, nous gardons toujours l'esprit ouvert et nous utilisons notre créativité pour résoudre les besoins latents du quotidien en fournissant des solutions pratiques qui améliorent la qualité de vie des gens.
Nous croyons que vous le méritez bien!

Fait de céramique et de silicone naturel, vertiGOmug est une tasse de 12oz (375ml) à double paroi isolée qui garde les boissons chaudes plus longtemps que ses acolytes.
Vous ressentirez toujours le lux et le réconfort de la céramique sur vos lèvres en buvant.
Buvez directement du couvercle innovateur en céramique qui refroidit les liquides à la température que vous désirez en quelques secondes seulement, 1 ou 2 gorgées à la fois tandis que la boisson reste bien au chaud dans la réserve isolée.
 
Vous pouvez également boire directement à la tasse en retirant simplement le couvercle.
Ah oui! Et le couvercle étanche empêche également les déversements accidentels. N'est-ce pas merveilleux!?!
 
Vue schématique du modèle WO en format ''Solo''
Comment fonctionne vertiGOmug?
son fonctionnement est très simple et son mécanisme est précis.
Comme vous l'avez probablement observé dans la vidéo démontrant notre prototype fonctionnel, il suffit de remplir votre vertiGOmug de votre boisson chaude préférée, puis simplement installer le couvercle innovateur.
La différence et surtout l'avantage est que vous n'avez pas besoin d'attendre que la totalité du volume liquide refroidisse avant de commencer à boire: Vous appuyez sur le bouton latéral qui pompe une gorgée de liquide dans la zone de refroidissement, sur le dessus du couvercle.
Attendez simplement que le liquide chaud se retrouvant dans la zone de refroidissement ait atteint la température désirée et buvez.
 
Cette opération prend environ 10 secondes en fonction de la température du liquide et de la température ambiante. Cela peut prendre jusqu'à 60 secondes si le liquide est à la température d'ébullition de 100 degrés Celcius.
 

Pas de piles, pas de mécanismes compliqués, pas de soucis, facile à nettoyer et va au lave-vaisselle. N'hésitez pas à proposer des optimisations, nous sommes ouverts aux suggestions et, qui sait, nous pourrons peut-être les ajouter avant la production.

Who else Needs the Custom Design and Features?</h2>
<p>We decided to build “Now It’s Simple Content Manager” because we (and our clients) always want custom design elements and features, such as integrations of 3-rd party widgets, and external data sources. Of course, there are many cms systems out there but none of them has all this features:</p><p></p><ul>
<li>provide <b>full control over templates and </b><b style=""background-color: initial;"">controllers directly inside the administration area</b>
</li>
<li>is full-featured with <b>nice editing (text, blocks, components)</b><br/>
</li>
<li>has powerful <b>Rest API</b>

</p><p></p><h3>Web Development Re-imagined</h3>
<p>Stop styling predefined widgets and components! Instead <b>attach reusable behaviours to your design</b>. Just take your HTML and setup content editors, controller, data bindings and parser in a few clicks.</p><p>

<p></p><h3>Most Effective Workflow (Designer-Coder-Editor)</h3>

<p>
</p><p><b>Want to find out something about page visitors? Use Forms!</b>. Forms allow you to implement longer questioner on the web page.

Who else Needs the Custom Design and Features?
We decided to build “Now It’s Simple Content Manager” because we (and our clients) always want custom design elements and features, such as integrations of 3-rd party widgets, and external data sources. Of course, there are many cms systems out there but none of them has all this features:
provide full control over templates and controllers directly inside the administration area

is full-featured with nice editing (text, blocks, components)

has powerful Rest API

built entirely in JavaScript (NodeJS)



Web Development Re-imagined
Stop styling predefined widgets and components! Instead attach reusable behaviours to your design. Just take your HTML and setup content editors, controller, data bindings and parser in a few clicks.

Editing Content You'll Fall in Love With Every content editor wants see the web page while editing it and have a full control over the widgets. Add a new page, set its design or write and publish a new blog post is a piece of cake. e.g. WYSIWYG is good for beginners. MARKDOWN is unbeatable when it comes to text writing and authoring. Technical support time will cut down to the minimum. Your clients will love you!

Most Effective Workflow (Designer-Coder-Editor)

Don't waste Your, Designer or Html Coder time on repeated content editing tasks. Draw the design or download the template, setup the widgets and let Content editors build the website structure and content. This will ensure you fastest website production.
Ultimate Marketing Tool
Now It’s Simple CMS was born out of frustration, when companies used web solely for the online presence forgetting its possibilities as the ultimate marketing tool. Changes on pages are costly - both in time and money - but the future with “Now It’s Simple” is flexible and fast.

Want to find out something about page visitors? Use Forms!. Forms allow you to implement longer questioner on the web page. Use one question forms to get a higher response rate and merge answers by email address.Create newsletters and autoresponders the same way as web pages. Template engine will replace properties inside brackets (e.g. [[name]]) by form, or customer data, after render.
Made by Web Developers for Web Developers and Designers

It is designed by web the developers just like you. We are in your shoes... Just remember how much time we have spent adjusting the design of a component. Now we can forget about it! Now It’s Simple Content Manager works with the process of the web development in mind. Widgets and their design are separated. You can reuse widgets, set their design for a new project, save and done!
Modern and Ultra Fast

It is a Node.js application powered by optimized Total.js framework. We appreciate MongoDB’s lighting fast speed. User Interface is written in AngularJS so can be very easy extended.

Now It’s Simple Content Manager templating is easy. All you need is a basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript for that little bit of dynamic functionality  and you are ready to go!

Use Any NodeJS Module!You can use any module from NPM. Also compatible with express middlewares. Just require it in controllers, modules, etc. For more information see Total.js documentation.Did We Mention It Is Simple?Thanks to Total.js modularity, project structure keeps very nice.

<h2>The Most Bang For Your Buck</h2>
<p><strong>Jackets</strong></p>
<p>At Threads of Apollo, we aim to offer  premium, leather jackets that rival most out there but also at a reasonable price.</p>
<p>1) It all starts with the leather. Each ToA jacket is made from premium <strong>full-grain sheepskin leather</strong>, to provide that soft, supple feel that you only find with expensive jackets. </p>
<p>2) We have paired the leather up with two separate inner linings. Each ToA jacket has a <strong>100% cotton lining for the body and separate inner sleeve linings made from 100% satin.</strong> </p>
<p>3) Each ToA jacket will also be equipped with high-quality gunmetal or silver snap buttons as well as <strong>YKK zippers</strong> which are known for their resilience. </p>
<p>4) These days, we understand individuals carry more on them than in the past. Unlike most leather jackets out there, each ToA jacket will have <strong>5 inner utility pockets</strong> that individuals can use to keep their stuff in without compromising the look of the jacket. </p>
<p><strong>Gloves </strong></p>
<p>We wanted to provide something else that went well with our jackets. After thinking about it, we came to the conclusion that nothing goes better with jackets than a nice pair of gloves. </p>
<p>Like our jackets, we wanted to provide the best possible gloves we could at a price that made sense.</p>
<p>1) Like our jackets, it all starts with the leather. Our gloves are made from premium <strong>top-grain sheepskin leather</strong> to match the feel of our jackets. </p>
<p>2) Our gloves will not only help keep your hands warm, they will feel so good that you'll never want to take them off. Each ToA pair will have a <strong>50% cashmere and 50% wool blend lining</strong> to ensure comfort. </p>
<p>3) Let's face it, we are addicted to our devices. It would be a shame if you couldn't use them while wearing our gloves. <strong>Each ToA pair will have touch screen material on the index and thumbs</strong> so anyone wearing them will be able to use their device while keeping their hands warm and comfy. </p>
<p>4) We wanted these gloves to be a part of our jackets....literally. Each ToA pair will have <strong>attachable snap buttons</strong> similar to a pair of inner snap buttons in each jacket so you can store your gloves and use them, wherever and whenever, without sacrificing any pocket space.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Achilles back with removable hood</i></p>
<p><strong>The Story</strong></p>
<p>There is probably no warrior as great as Achilles. He was the deciding factor in the Trojan War. At times, Achilles was known for his all-consuming rage, which meant trouble for his enemies as well as the gods themselves. Achilles was not scared of anyone. His initial pursuit for greatness and glory was derailed by his thirst for vengeance against the man who killed his cousin. Although Achilles got his revenge, these chain of events eventually led to his death...an arrow through his only weak spot, his heel. We wanted our take on the racer leather jacket to be the most versatile of the three designs. A jacket that is ideal, but not limited to, a starter jacket. A straightforward style with a removable hood, this jacket can be dressed up or down. The threads that keep this jacket together are imbued with Achilles' essence. We all have weaknesses. Achilles was known for his heel; however, not accepting his own flaws was his ultimate downfall. Let this jacket be a reminder that, although we are all warriors in our own right, being self-aware of who you are as a person will allow you to reach your full potential.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Ares back with removable belt</i></p>
<p><strong>The Story</strong></p>
<p>In Ancient Greek mythology, Ares was one of the twelve Olympians. He was known as the ""God of War"". Ares was the personification of the aspects of war that dealt with ruthlessness and aggression. He was hated by most gods due to his savage nature. So, why did we name a jacket after him? Despite all his faults, Ares did what he needed to do to be victorious. When you are dealing with negative feelings or a lack of self-confidence, sometimes, you need to be ruthless and do whatever it takes to ensure that the positive prevails over the negative. To do that, you need to feel powerful. We chose to associate Ares with our take on the iconic Biker jacket. With its minimal design and fearless look; the threads that keep this jacket together, are imbued with Ares' essence. So, the next time you feel negative or down, channel your inner Ares and deal with those emotions head-on and without mercy.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Icarus back with removable fur collar</i></p>
<p><strong>The Story</strong></p>
<p>In Ancient Greece, Icarus was the son of the master craftsman Daedalus. After both were imprisoned, Daedalus created wings out of wax and feathers to escape. Daedalus flew first, but before he did, he warned Icarus not to fly too high because the sun would melt his wings; or too low because the sea's dampness would clog them. Icarus did not listen and his hubris got the best of him. He flew too high and his wings melted away. Icarus plunged to his death. He took a worthwhile risk when he decided to fly. A risk that would have paid off if he had only stayed the course. We think Icarus is the perfect namesake for our minimalist and modern take on the iconic flight jacket. Imbued with Icarus' essence, let this jacket represent level-headedness. Whenever you are facing a worthwhile risk, whether it is getting out of your comfort zone to speak to someone that you admire or starting a business; remember not to get too high when things are good or too low when they aren't. Stay the course and stay confident. Good things will come.</p>

<p><strong>The Story</strong></p>
<p>Apollo was arguably the Greek God with the most talent. Whether it was creating the next great master piece, taking down his foes with his exceptional archery skills or healing individuals through medicine; Apollo's hands were gifted with many talent. An individual’s hands are vital when it comes to reaching their potential, so we decided the best accessory to start off with would be our take on leather gloves. Our modern design and the ability to attach them to any ToA jacket, makes our gloves an ideal item to go hand in hand with our jackets. Imbued with Apollo's skill, we want anyone who wears them to, not only protect their hands from the cold, but also serve as a reminder of your potential that you can unlock within yourself by using your hands. Unlike Apollo, we aren't Greek Gods, born with self- confidence. We need to get out of our comfort zone to grow. Everyone has some talent within them that is begging to be released. So, the next time you are holding your self back from accessing your talent, wear these gloves and feel Apollo’s confidence flowing through you. </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Our Motivation</h3>
<h3>It's Personal</h3>
<p>At Threads of Apollo (ToA), we want you to look and feel good. By creating stories behind each product, we hope to spark positive feelings that drive good habits. Ultimately it is up to you to reach your full potential. Our goal is to help you get there in our own unique way.  </p>
<p>I was struggling with finding my way out of my own negative and sometimes paralyzing thoughts. The way I was thinking and my old habits just weren't working. I needed to change before it was too late. I decided to start with how I dressed. After getting some help from a friend as well as doing my own research online, I started to put together some simple outfits. The better I looked, the better I started feeling about myself. I later realized that I was using apparel to consistently associate the positive thoughts and habits I set out for myself. Overtime, things like starting a company, which felt impossible before, now felt doable. I wanted to share my experiences with as many individuals as possible. I was fortunate enough to have connections with a leather apparel manufacture overseas. I thought, what better way to help than with leather jackets. </p>
<p>Nothing exudes confidence more than a leather jacket! Whether someone is new to fashion and wants a quality leather jacket to start off or whether someone is a seasoned veteran when it comes to fashion and is looking for a quality and modern piece to go with their style.  </p>
<p>After a year and a half of setting up the company, prototyping, changes and delays; I am ready to present this brand. We will start off my offering premium leather jackets and gloves at a price that is affordable for most young adults. I want this brand to be as unique as the individuals wearing the apparel. The only thing stopping me now is money. I used what I had to get this to where it is now. Kickstarter is where dreams come true. I hope that is the case for me too. I have the designs. I have the capability to make the jackets. I am determined to succeed. All I need now is your backing. </p>
<h3>The Designs</h3>
<p>Based out of Vancouver, BC Canada, we set out to design three very different leather jackets that are different enough from each other to work with any style. By combining modern minimalist style with the seamless integration of utility pockets, we are proud to offer premium apparel from a brand made by a flawed young adult, for flawed young adults. It doesn't matter who you are, everyone deserves access to high-quality apparel that suits their style and that makes them feel more confident.</p>
<h3>The Affordability</h3>
<p>Being a young adult male myself and navigating life in one of the most expensive cities in the world; I am more than sympathetic when it comes to the deciding if it is worth spending half your paycheck on one apparel item. At Threads of Apollo, this is personal to us. It is our duty to let young adult males have access to high quality and fashionable jackets that most of us can afford. And if you don't mind spending big on apparel items; then the money you save on a Threads of Apollo jacket will come in handy when you are looking to buy that next big item. </p>

<li>
<strong>We only order stock based on how many backers we receive allowing us to save on storage and logistics at the very beginning.</strong><br/> </li>
<li><strong>By getting rid of the middle man, using modern marketing tools like social media marketing &amp; ads, not needing brick and motor stores and the overhead associated with them; we get to keep the price as low as possible without comprising the quality of the jackets and gloves.</strong></li>

We only order stock based on how many backers we receive allowing us to save on storage and logistics at the very beginning. 
By getting rid of the middle man, using modern marketing tools like social media marketing & ads, not needing brick and motor stores and the overhead associated with them; we get to keep the price as low as possible without comprising the quality of the jackets and gloves.

 
Measurements 



Please note that these jackets are slim fit. For a looser/more regular fit, please size up.
These jackets are hand stitched. 90% of the time, the sizes will be correct. Humans aren't perfect though so please allow for a 0.25-0.5 inch error tolerance. 
Please note that these gloves are standard European sized. They are more slim fit then your typical US sized gloves.
These gloves are also hand stitched. 90% of the time, the sizes will be correct. People make mistakes though so please allow for a 0.1-0.2 inch error tolerance.

<p>When designing the A-Strap, we wanted the A-Strap to not only keep AirPods safe through tight and secure attachments, but also to be easy for users to set and remove the AirPods into and from the A-Strap.

<p>1.       Aluminum outer layer: The aluminium prevents the inner layer from being over-extended. Other AirPods straps are easily over-extended and, often, users lose their AirPods easily.</p>
<p>2.       Silicon inner layer: The silicon makes the A-Strap easy to set and remove. With silicon friction, A-Strap can hold AirPods firmly. </p>
<p>3.       Special space: AirPods have size variability between 0.3mm to 0.7mm. Our design has taken this into consideration and ensured that this variability can easily be matched by our A-Straps.</p>
<p>With these design consideration, customers can enjoy AirPods in the comfort of knowing that they are safely secured in the A-Strap.</p>

<h2>Clothes Quality</h2>
<p>We used 100% cotton. 100% Cotton is not chemical fiber, so it is recommended for sensitive skin such as allergy and atopy. Also, the shape of the clothes is well maintained and durable compared to other fabrics. So it is suitable for use in autumn and winter and can give the wearer a soft, warm feel.<br/> We also only use high-quality fabrics that have undergone ""Dumbbell Washing"" and ""Tentering"". After the dumbbell washing process, you can see the effects of calmness, soft touch , and low shrinkage. Furthermore, It is possible to maintain the fit of the clothes for a long time by increasing the durability of the clothes after the Tentering process. So you can avoid shrinkage and deformation of your clothes as much as possible.</p>

<h2>Actual Situation</h2>

It can be inferred that the unofficial figures of abandoned animals would be much higher. Too many animals are dying alone. We have a plan to support the animals that have lost their families.

<h2><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Rake less!  Live more!  Direct-Bag-It!</span></strong></h2>
<h3><strong>How much time do you spend raking leaves each fall?</strong></h3>
<p>In 2005 we moved to a tree filled suburban St. Louis neighborhood.  The shade is great and the trees are beautiful, but come fall the yard hands down its decree of punishment: sentenced to 70+ yard bags of hard labor. </p>
<p>Like many suburban home owners across the country, we dispose of our yard waste using the ubiquitous brown paper yard bag, as that is what our city accepts.  Filling these boogers is a labor intensive, annoying, time consuming chore.  I realized that I was spending most of my fall weekends dealing with our leafy bounty.  I hated raking and filling those bags—so much bending down, picking up, and repetitive tamping trying to get the most leaves into every bag.  Mowing wasn't much better.  My grass-catcher turned leaf-catcher completely filled after about 20 yards and I would have to dump it 4 - 5 times to fill a yard bag—spilling and making a mess in the process.  I knew there had to be a better way: I wanted my mower to fill <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">directly</span></em> into a yard bag.</p>
<h3><strong>Becoming Direct-Bag-It: <em>the smart way to bag your yard</em></strong></h3>
<p>An ill-fated prototype was thrown together in 2006.  It took less than one trip around the outer loop of my back yard to decide I had created an example of what not to do.  But, in prototyping, learning what not to do is half the battle.  The goal was shelved for several years while growing the family, but in 2009 I revisited the idea during some course work.  Steady progress toward a different prototype culminated in an 11 December 2011 test that got this ball rolling. </p>
<p>This thing really worked, saved time, and saved me effort.  Since that day I have spent just about all of my free time and a good chunk of change getting Direct-Bag-It patented and refining the design to the improved multi-season configuration you saw of alpha prototype in the video and in the beta prototype CAD renderings.  Now my goal is to get the same time and effort savings into your hands this fall!  Look below to see why Direct-Bag-It is the multi-season answer for your yard!</p>
<h3>To ensure high quality and mangage costs, Direct-Bag-It is sold as a complete system: a modifed base mower with the bagging attachments.</h3>
<h3>Please see FAQ below for more information.</h3>

<h3><strong>Help Me Help You</strong></h3>
<p>Direct-Bag-It will help YOU (and not just in the fall, see above and FAQ).  But I need help from you and all of your leaf-burdened friends to get the Direct-Bag-It beta prototype in the hands of early adopter customers.  You see, this is a manufacturing project, which is kind of old-school in these days of apps and web-tech startups.  Volume is everything in manufacturing, and <strong>I need to drum up sales for at least 40 of these puppies</strong> to get the production costs low enough to extend to you a reasonable purchase price in the mid-hundreds.  And, to even make that price possible, there is a good bit of fabrication I need to do.  I need help from everyone who has ever loathed raking and bagging their yard to contribute so I can buy equipment (see FAQ) and set up shop for the parts it didn't make sense to outsource. </p>
<p>As tokens of my sincere appreciation in helping with this effort, I have a variety of perks available to commemorate your pledge toward the quest of defeating excess yard work.  <strong>This is an all-or-nothing, fixed funding campaign…if I don't meet my goal, I can't pull this off.  Please help make it happen!</strong></p>
<h3><strong>This is a Chapter, Not the Book</strong></h3>
<p>Your help will prove there is a market for Direct-Bag-It and jumpstart subsequent production and design improvements.  I will work it as long as it is profitable or until one of the big players realizes this is the way leaves and grass clippings should be bagged and licenses my patent. </p>
<p>If financially successful with this, I intend for it to benefit my family of course, but it will also do its small part to help our country.  As I said before, this is manufacturing, and manufacturing creates jobs up and down the supply chain more than just about any other industry.  I like that and you should too.  I pledge to keep work on this in the United States, and whenever possible source parts domestically.  If I do license to a big player, I will have them pledge the same.</p>
<p>There are many other engineering and design challenges I hope to eventually pursue through my company <a href=""http://topdownengineering.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Top-Down Engineering LLC website"">Top-Down Engineering LLC</a>.  Direct-Bag-It is the focus for now since it solves so much and has strong potential.  Creating a revenue stream from this will allow me to apply myself to even more challenging pursuits at the intersection of energy, resource scarcity, and climate change (yes, I have ideas).  This is the first step.  Please help me take it!</p>

<h2><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</span></strong></h2>
<p><strong>Q: Is Direct-Bag-It the complete system, mower and attachments, or just the attachments?</strong></p>
<p>A: Currently, Direct-Bag-It is the complete system, mower and attachments.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: Why can't I just buy the attachments and use them on the mower I have?</strong></p>
<p>A:  The physical variations from mower to mower make it difficult to design parts that work across platforms.  Unique parts take extra design time and are expensive to manufacture in low volumes.  Note that the base mower for Direct-Bag-It is turned 180 degrees -- the rear discharge is now in the front, wheels have been swapped, the handle has been re-mounted, startup pull-cord is re-managed, motor and blade provide sufficient flow, etc.  As much as I would have liked to have created a universal attachment version of Direct-Bag-It, it is not feasible at this stage.  My approach has been to start with a high quality, light-weight, steel deck mower to produce something I know that works so that customers have a consistent positive user experience.  Direct-Bag-It will replace your mower as a year-round, multi-season, time and effort saving system...you can put that old mower on craigslist!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: How do I know if Direct-Bag-It is right for me?</strong></p>
<p>A: If you rake and bag your leaves multiple times in the fall and push mow your lawn during spring and summer, you should definitely consider Direct-Bag-It.  If the thought of buying a lawn vacuum to manage your leaf load has ever crossed your mind, you should absolutely consider Direct-Bag-It. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: A lawn mower has enough umph to lift the leaves and grass clippings into a yard bag?</strong></p>
<p>A: I was surprised too!  The flow from the mower is actually quite remarkable.  My first prototype included an auxiliary blower, but I found it was not necessary.  Shows the importance of prototypes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: What do you mean by beta prototype?</strong></p>
<p>A: You should expect this product to work well, save you time, and save you effort.  However Direct-Bag-It is in an intermediate stage of design refinement.  Whereas a final commercial product would use injection-molded plastic components, this beta prototype still has some PVC pipe.  Whereas a final commercial product would be adjustable using hand levers, pins, and knobs, this beta prototype requires you to break out the socket set and turn a wrench.  That is basically what I mean...it still has some hardware store type components, may require a bit more hands-on thinking from you, but it will still perform the task effectively and efficiently.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: What was the alpha prototype?</strong></p>
<p>A: You saw the alpha prototype in the video and other pictures.  It is made of painted wood!  It is still tough to beat wood, screws, and bolts for time- and cost-effective prototyping.  The system works great actually, but is not suited for manufacturing.  As discussed in the specs section, the system you will receive is made from fabricated steel, a more manufacturable, respectable material for valued customers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: What do you mean about being multi-season?</strong></p>
<p>A:</p>
<p><strong>Fall:</strong>  As you saw in the video, Direct-Bag-It was specially made to help you in the fall—significantly reducing your raking, piling, lifting, excessive tamping, leaf bagging time.  </p>
<p><strong>Spring and Early Summer: </strong>  Direct-Bag-It is still advantageous for mowing grass in the spring and early summer, however, a modification to the bag is suggested.   It makes sense to use a right-sized, shortened yard bag (achieved by cutting off the top 1/3) to make the filled bag more manageable.  Grass clippings are much heavier than leaves, and a yard bag completely filled with grass would weigh something like 60 lbs.  When filled, the shortened bag weights a more manageable 25 lbs…about all you would want to push or lift to carry to the curb.  The inlet adapter arm is adjustable and a different inlet adapter is used to smooth the angle of the transfer tube.</p>
<p><strong>Summer:</strong>  During the summer when the grass is less robust, bagging doesn't even make sense.  It is better to change to mulching mode to shed some extra weight.  During this time, the bag holder and transfer assembly are removable and a mulch plate can be installed.</p>
<p><strong>When My Yard Has Been Neglected:</strong>  Say there is a situation where the grass is way overgrown and bagging or mulching won't even work.   You've just got to hack through it.  In that case, the side discharge of the original mower is still available.  Once the clippings dry, maybe you can bag them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I see around Direct-Bag-It?</strong></p>
<p>A: In the fall, when the full sized bag is used, line-of-sight is reduced but not completely obscured.  This was the crux of latest design configuration.  If I was not satisfied with the line-of-sight, I would not use it.  You will still be able to see the line you are tracking, but may look to the side more often than with a typical mower.  The trade-off is worth it for the time and effort saved versus raking, trust me.  During spring and early summer, with the shortened bag, line-of-sight is practically the same as with a regular mower.  Again, achieving acceptable line-of-sight was required for me to use the system myself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: Will all the leaves be picked up on the first pass?</strong></p>
<p>A: No, not completely.  There will be some fragments that get left behind as mulch.  But then again, think about the performance of your raking or conventional mowing...I am guessing some gets left behind.  The difference with Direct-Bag-It is that the process overall takes so much less time and effort.  By general observation, I would say 75-85% of the leaves are bagged on the first pass.  The bulk of the leaves are collected and there will be a clear line of where you have been.  If desired, a reverse or second pass probably gets you into the +95% range.  Bagging the leaves in a counter-clockwise loop makes a big difference as excess typically flows to the left side of the system.  The concentric loops serve to corral the leaves to their eventual doom.  The same loop-wise method is not necessary while mowing during grass seasons.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: Will Direct-Bag-It vacuum my sidewalk and driveway?</strong></p>
<p>A: Not exactly.  One my discoveries while using the system was that good grass helps to form a seal between the mower deck and the ground.  Without grass to perform that function, leaves and debris on hard surfaces tend to swirl out from underneath the deck leading to incomplete collection.  Deck height can be adjusted some to alleviate this, but generally your best bet is to move the debris to the lawn to bag it from there.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: Does Direct-Bag-It clog?</strong></p>
<p>A: It can, but fortunately the transfer tube is easy to clear.  The main culprit is pushing too quickly over dense leaves or grass.  Under normal conditions you can push Direct-Bag-It just as fast as a regular mower, however, just like you would slow down with a regular mower in thick areas, you’ll need to do the same with Direct-Bag-It.  Sticks can also start a clog, so a stick pickup prior to mowing is a good idea.  Again, something that usually makes sense to do anytime you mow.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: Does the fill chute ever disconnect from the bag?</strong></p>
<p>A: It can, but fortunately the fill chute plastic band is adjustable to minimize this occurrence.  A tight seal is important for keeping the fill chute connected.  I have noticed that from lot-to-lot, bag sizes do change enough to affect the seal.  So, if it is too loose, I expand the ring out.  If it is too tight (worse case, torn bag), I adjust the ring in.  I think outdoor temperature can have an effect as well requiring some adjustment, but I am still evaluating that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: Is Direct-Bag-It Safe?</strong></p>
<p>A: Insofar as lawn mowers are safe, Direct-Bag-It is safe.  All of the risks traditionally associated with rotary push mowers are present.  Additional considerations include clearing clogs and disconnect of the fill chute from the yard bag while bagging.  If you need to clear a clog from the discharge adapter, the spark plug wire should be disconnected to prevent accidental operation of the motor.  If the fill chute disconnects from the yard bag, immediately release the mower safety handle, causing the engine to stop.  Operators should wear personal protective equpment for eye sight and hearing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: How will you provide support and what are the terms of sale?</strong></p>
<p>A: My expectation is that as an early adopter of a beta prototype Direct-Bag-It, you will provide me feedback I can use to continually improve the system.  I want the good and the bad, the latter of which I hope is few and far between.  I don't really know how this will evolve with multiple systems ""out in the wild,"" but I can assure you that I want you to be happy with the system.   I will try to make reasonable accommodations for any issue you may encounter and handle each on a case-by-case basis.  I am still working with legal to draft specific terms of sale, but generally I plan to provide a 30-day money-back guarantee.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: What do you need and why?</strong></p>
<p>A: I basically need to set up shop for some light fabrication, assembly, packaging, and shipping of the system; yes, in my garage.  Hopefully this will be another ""started in the garage"" business success story.</p>

<p>I am sure there are expected and unexpeded are challenges lurking.  I have already overcome many to get this far, so I am confident I can overcome any that are ahead.</p>
<p>With anything that is manufactured, parts avaialability and delivery timeline can cause issues.  I have contacted suppliers of key components to let them know the level of orders that may occur.  That said, until you really submit that PO, it's hard to know whether what you need will arrive on time and at the budgeted cost.  Rest assured, if supply chain issues are detected, I will communicate those to you with an estimate of impact to delivery date.</p>
<p>I am just at the point of receiving test-fit parts for assembly of the beta-prototype of Direct-Bag-It.  There is some risk that parts will not assemble or operate as I expect, however, I should have time to resolve those prior purchasing for these orders.</p>
<p>Weather is a concern for my hands-on demonstration perks.  If we have a very wet fall it may be difficult to schedule and make all the rounds.</p>

<h2> </h2></div>","Rake less!  Live more!  Direct-Bag-It!
How much time do you spend raking leaves each fall?
In 2005 we moved to a tree filled suburban St. Louis neighborhood.  The shade is great and the trees are beautiful, but come fall the yard hands down its decree of punishment: sentenced to 70+ yard bags of hard labor. 
Like many suburban home owners across the country, we dispose of our yard waste using the ubiquitous brown paper yard bag, as that is what our city accepts.  Filling these boogers is a labor intensive, annoying, time consuming chore.  I realized that I was spending most of my fall weekends dealing with our leafy bounty.  I hated raking and filling those bags—so much bending down, picking up, and repetitive tamping trying to get the most leaves into every bag.  Mowing wasn't much better.  My grass-catcher turned leaf-catcher completely filled after about 20 yards and I would have to dump it 4 - 5 times to fill a yard bag—spilling and making a mess in the process.  I knew there had to be a better way: I wanted my mower to fill directly into a yard bag.
Becoming Direct-Bag-It: the smart way to bag your yard
An ill-fated prototype was thrown together in 2006.  It took less than one trip around the outer loop of my back yard to decide I had created an example of what not to do.  But, in prototyping, learning what not to do is half the battle.  The goal was shelved for several years while growing the family, but in 2009 I revisited the idea during some course work.  Steady progress toward a different prototype culminated in an 11 December 2011 test that got this ball rolling. 
This thing really worked, saved time, and saved me effort.  Since that day I have spent just about all of my free time and a good chunk of change getting Direct-Bag-It patented and refining the design to the improved multi-season configuration you saw of alpha prototype in the video and in the beta prototype CAD renderings.  Now my goal is to get the same time and effort savings into your hands this fall!  Look below to see why Direct-Bag-It is the multi-season answer for your yard!
To ensure high quality and mangage costs, Direct-Bag-It is sold as a complete system: a modifed base mower with the bagging attachments.
Please see FAQ below for more information.





Help Me Help You
Direct-Bag-It will help YOU (and not just in the fall, see above and FAQ).  But I need help from you and all of your leaf-burdened friends to get the Direct-Bag-It beta prototype in the hands of early adopter customers.  You see, this is a manufacturing project, which is kind of old-school in these days of apps and web-tech startups.  Volume is everything in manufacturing, and I need to drum up sales for at least 40 of these puppies to get the production costs low enough to extend to you a reasonable purchase price in the mid-hundreds.  And, to even make that price possible, there is a good bit of fabrication I need to do.  I need help from everyone who has ever loathed raking and bagging their yard to contribute so I can buy equipment (see FAQ) and set up shop for the parts it didn't make sense to outsource. 
As tokens of my sincere appreciation in helping with this effort, I have a variety of perks available to commemorate your pledge toward the quest of defeating excess yard work.  This is an all-or-nothing, fixed funding campaign…if I don't meet my goal, I can't pull this off.  Please help make it happen!
This is a Chapter, Not the Book
Your help will prove there is a market for Direct-Bag-It and jumpstart subsequent production and design improvements.  I will work it as long as it is profitable or until one of the big players realizes this is the way leaves and grass clippings should be bagged and licenses my patent. 
If financially successful with this, I intend for it to benefit my family of course, but it will also do its small part to help our country.  As I said before, this is manufacturing, and manufacturing creates jobs up and down the supply chain more than just about any other industry.  I like that and you should too.  I pledge to keep work on this in the United States, and whenever possible source parts domestically.  If I do license to a big player, I will have them pledge the same.
There are many other engineering and design challenges I hope to eventually pursue through my company Top-Down Engineering LLC.  Direct-Bag-It is the focus for now since it solves so much and has strong potential.  Creating a revenue stream from this will allow me to apply myself to even more challenging pursuits at the intersection of energy, resource scarcity, and climate change (yes, I have ideas).  This is the first step.  Please help me take it!
 
Direct-Bag-It:  benefits, how-to, and specs
Benefits:


At least a twofold time reduction relative to conventional raking and bagging. (preliminary testing)

At least a twofold reduction in yard bag usage relative to raking and tamping. (preliminary testing)
A decreased overall effort relative to raking and bagging.
A yard with the leaves removed and the grass mowed simultaneously.
A leaf bagging system that is adaptable for optimum use in the fall as well as other seasons using the grass bagging and mulching modes.
The satisfaction of buying a multi-season, efficiency enhancing system that costs significantly less than a yard vacuum (that does not fill directly into yard bags, takes up extra space in your garage, and will only be used a few months out of the year).
How-to:
The base of the fill chute contains a plastic band which is compressed to the inside of the yard bag.  When released, it expands and seals to the yard bag.  Once connected, both are loaded into the bag holder.  The top of the fill chute has a draw string that cinches to the inlet adapter.  That's it!  Pull the mower starter cord, push the system, and directly fill that yard bag!
The fill chute is the key component to the patent pending Direct-Bag-It system.  It vents the discharge air and allows for overfill—enabling you to bag longer and achieve the ultimate in yard bagging efficiency: the single tamp. 
Once the bag and fill chute are full, un-cinch the top of the fill chute and remove together.  Settle the bag and then use the fill chute to tamp the overfill.  Remove the fill chute and there you have it: a directly filled, fully filled, cleanly filled, single tamp yard bag.

A: It can, but fortunately the fill chute plastic band is adjustable to minimize this occurrence.  A tight seal is important for keeping the fill chute connected.  I have noticed that from lot-to-lot, bag sizes do change enough to affect the seal.  So, if it is too loose, I expand the ring out.  If it is too tight (worse case, torn bag), I adjust the ring in.  I think outdoor temperature can have an effect as well requiring some adjustment, but I am still evaluating that.
 
Q: Is Direct-Bag-It Safe?
A: Insofar as lawn mowers are safe, Direct-Bag-It is safe.  All of the risks traditionally associated with rotary push mowers are present.  Additional considerations include clearing clogs and disconnect of the fill chute from the yard bag while bagging.  If you need to clear a clog from the discharge adapter, the spark plug wire should be disconnected to prevent accidental operation of the motor.  If the fill chute disconnects from the yard bag, immediately release the mower safety handle, causing the engine to stop.  Operators should wear personal protective equpment for eye sight and hearing.
 
Q: How will you provide support and what are the terms of sale?
A: My expectation is that as an early adopter of a beta prototype Direct-Bag-It, you will provide me feedback I can use to continually improve the system.  I want the good and the bad, the latter of which I hope is few and far between.  I don't really know how this will evolve with multiple systems ""out in the wild,"" but I can assure you that I want you to be happy with the system.   I will try to make reasonable accommodations for any issue you may encounter and handle each on a case-by-case basis.  I am still working with legal to draft specific terms of sale, but generally I plan to provide a 30-day money-back guarantee.
 
Q: What do you need and why?
A: I basically need to set up shop for some light fabrication, assembly, packaging, and shipping of the system; yes, in my garage.  Hopefully this will be another ""started in the garage"" business success story.

Project Risks and Challenges
I am sure there are expected and unexpeded are challenges lurking.  I have already overcome many to get this far, so I am confident I can overcome any that are ahead.
With anything that is manufactured, parts avaialability and delivery timeline can cause issues.  I have contacted suppliers of key components to let them know the level of orders that may occur.  That said, until you really submit that PO, it's hard to know whether what you need will arrive on time and at the budgeted cost.  Rest assured, if supply chain issues are detected, I will communicate those to you with an estimate of impact to delivery date.
I am just at the point of receiving test-fit parts for assembly of the beta-prototype of Direct-Bag-It.  There is some risk that parts will not assemble or operate as I expect, however, I should have time to resolve those prior purchasing for these orders.
Weather is a concern for my hands-on demonstration perks.  If we have a very wet fall it may be difficult to schedule and make all the rounds.
 
Last But Not Least
Thank you to my family, friends, and professional partners for helping this product get to this stage!  I am sure I will continue to lean on you as this moves forward.   Let's make it happen!

And, Thank You! for considering my campaign.  If you have any questions or comments, I can be reached at andrew@topdownengineering.com",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><span>In three years we’ve come a long way. Here is what we’ve done so far. From left to right.</span></p>
<p><span>Picture 1: Prototype #1(water sensor) was our first proof of a concept. As you can see it required A4 page format to be set up. However, this was our first prototype which we used to succesfully complete our first water sensor in both fresh and salt water.</span></p>
<p>Picture 2: Prototype #2(square) was the first prototype which we were able to put in the palm of your hand. It was able to connect to our test SmartPhone application and transmit data. </p>
<p>Picture 2: Prototype #3(in the middle) was our first prototype that used standard micro-components and tested three major threads: drowning, wandering away, abduction.</p>
<p>Picture 2: Prototype #4 was our first fully functional prototype (the size of a quarter), it was able to connect to our cloud based alert processing system via smartphone and become a truly reliable smart mobile solution for children.</p>

There will be a weighted system applied to the voting. For example, a vote accompanied with a pre-order for that design will be weighed more heavily that a simple single vote.
The goal is to bring these designs to life and maximize royalties for the designer.
 And now, back to our in-house designs.

Actual colors may appear different from above renderings. Limited Edition Watches  To commemorate our launch, we're rewarding our backers with limited edition versions of our in-house watches. Each watch will feature an ""OP '21"" mark that commemorates the launch year and denotes that its owner is an Original Patron.Only 300 hundred watches of each design will ever be produced with this mark, and you can only get these special edition watches here and now.You will not see this mark an any future designs or launches. Complimentary Limited-Edition PrintsJust as exclusive will be our complimentary limited edition commemorative prints. Every backer who pre-orders a watch will receive a free 11” x 17"" (279.4mm x 431.8mm) print that highlights their watch and the spirit of the brand. The prints, which were inspired by the vintage travel ads of the early 20th century, will be printed on archival matte paper and will be individually numbered.And again, you can only get these special edition prints here and now. The Skylark Print is a play on our belief that good design speaks for itself and naturally gets noticed - something that we hope speaks true of the Skylark and all of our designs. The Ogden Print. The basic concept for this print came to me very early on. As a decades long rider of public transportation in my home city of Chicago IL, the subway car became my inspiration for this image of riders on the subway.You first notice a sea of hands, all with smart watches except for one hand featuring the Ogden. The watches were aligned in a way to make the Ogden stand out. It's meant to stand out, the watch was designed to look different than anything else.If you look closely at the ads along the top of the train car, you'll notice that they read: ""They may be smart, but they don't have heart"". This is a reference to that fact that while smart watches are trendy and can do a million things, there's still value and beauty in an invention that has done one thing, so elegantly, for over 500 years. And especially in the escapement mechanism that is its beating heart. Just because something is new doesn't mean that it's better. The Archer Print is meant to capture that feeling of getting away from the office on a beautiful Friday after work. The caption on the bottom emphasizes that there's more to life than work - something that I know a lot of us often lose sight of. Exclusive Campaign PricingBackers who preorder a watch will save up to $200 off of retail by taking advantage of our special campaign pricing.Please note: The Ogden and Archer models are stretch goals and will only be made available for preorder if our stretch goal targets are met.  PerksBackers who support our campaign can choose from a number of contribution options and perks.Pre-order a watchBackers who wish to pre-order a watch will receive a special edition, limited availability mechanical watch (only 300 “OP ‘21” watches of each design will ever be made) at a discount that is only available here and now.Additionally, backers who preorder a watch will receive a complimentary, 11"" x 17"" (279.4mm x 431.8mm) print featuring custom artwork highlighting their new watch.Please note: The Ogden and Archer models are stretch goals and will only be made available for preorder if our stretch goal targets are met.Store CreditsBackers can also select a store credit as a perk.

Made of high-quality waxed canvas with soft suede lining, our watch rolls can accommodate up to five 46mm watches and accessories.Final watch roll design is still being finalized. We will update the campaign page with product photography once product samples are approved and photographed.Product PackagingEvery effort will be made to only use recyclable and/or sustainable product packaging for everything from corrugated cardboard to packing paper and tape. Warranty and Shipping
All watches are professionally regulated (in 6 positions) after assembly.
All watches come with 1-year warranty that covers defective parts and workmanship. It does not coveraccidental damage or water damage.
Free shipping worldwide to most countries (please message us with any questions/concerns).
For orders outside of the US, backers will be responsible for shipping and any applicable duty/VAT charges.
 What will we use the funds for?ProductionProduction and assembly costs for our watches account for the majority of the funds required for this campaign.Product DevelopmentResources will be used for further product development on our watches (additional color options and styles), straps (additional colors, materials, and clasps), wallet rolls (additional materials and functionality) and packaging.LegalAny project that deals with intellectual property (IP) requires legal counsel and the drafting of specific, detailed contracts that protect both the designer and company.Web DevelopmentResources will be needed to build our online store and community platform.SourcingResources will be needed to secure additional vendor and supplier partners in order to increase capacity and expand product offerings.CreativeAdditional creative resources will be required to drive the creation of new ads, designs, and digital content. Everything to this point has been created exclusively by Juan and his basic knowledge of the Adobe Creative Suite, so we will need to invest in the expertise of professional creatives! Timeline  Risks and ChallengesLead-times. Unfortunately, there is always a risk that suppliers will not fulfill orders on time or that there are other unforeseen delays with production and delivery. However, we're only working with vendors with whom we have an established relationship and long history of past watch collaborations. These products are tried and true.We will continue to work closely with these partners to try to anticipate and mitigate any potential delays in production and to make sure we communicate any risk to the timeline with our backers ASAP.We are committed to being transparent with our backers and our community with regards to the timeline and will actively be communicating about the process every step of the way. About Us Juan has spent the last decade designing and launching millions of products for some of the biggest companies in the world. After earning an MBA from the University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana, he went on to become a strategic promotional and product partner with companies such as General Mills, Kellogg’s, and Danone. Most recently he has worked as a senior product manager for Stanley Black & Decker and Honeywell. Juan has spent the last 5 years obsessing about watches and EVERY detail of this project while continuing to research the watch industry, meet with trained watch makers, and traveling domestically and abroad to consult with watch manufacturers and vendors.  Founded in 2007, Wiegand Custom Watch, LLC is a family-run business based in the city of Mentor, Ohio USA. They build their watches using only the highest-grade parts from all over the globe including Switzerland, France, Japan, USA, and Germany. LÜM-TEC is their showcase brand featuring handcrafted watches built by professional watchmakers. Thank you for visiting our campaign page.

Watchpaper: ""By choosing the path of a social responsible business model, Cloutier is adding to the challenges, this is one more reason you should check out their project on Indiegogo and share it with your friends."" 

Pretty Darn Cool: ""Apart from trying to help better the worlds' water, the Cloutier Nouvelle-France watch is absolutely beautiful, with classic finishes and a minimalistic feel to it""

TechMASH UK: ""Here is a cool way of getting your hands on a brilliant stylishly designed watch and help WaterAid provide clean safe drinking water...""

Why use a Crowdfunding site for this project?
IndieGoGo allows us to raise the capital needed to deal directly with the best manufactures out there and to cut out the middle men (Distributors, brokers, retailers) providing you with a great quality watch at an affordable price and at the same time supporting a great cause with no risk on your part.
1) Cut out the middle men
2) Get a beautiful timepiece at a great price
3) Help make the world a better place

4) No Risk! -  Funders get their money back if campaign does not reach the 65,000$ goal 

 

Our Story   


Founded by a group of friends in Montreal, a city know for it's European flair and sophistication, Cloutier Nouvelle-France was conceived as an alternative startup challenging the status quo of the current business world.  






With a philanthropic emphasis as our backbone, we strongly believe that businesses have a bigger role to pay in this world than simply turning a profit.
While many people in our societies have prospered, too many people are still left behind.
Over 1 billion people on this earth are still living in extreme poverty. 
According to UNICEF 17,000 children die per day, mostly from preventable and treatable causes. 
For this reason we decided to combine our love of fashion, watches and social entrepreneurship, to offer elegantly crafted affordable timepieces with a greater purpose.


                                        

For our first project, we’ve decided to focus on one of our most basic needs, which most people take for granted, clean water.Over 748 million people in the world do not have access to safe water. 


A child dies every 60 seconds from water-related diseases. Diarrhea, being one of these illnesses, is the second leading cause of death among children under five worldwide. 


Women and children spend 140 million hours a day collecting water for their families’ survival. This is time not working for income to support family nor going to school... Education being a vital part to the growth of all societies. 


Safe water is also considered a life blood of the Ebola treatment units and plays a huge part in preventing future outbreaks.

Cloutier Nouvelle-France strongly believes that every man, woman and child should have access to clean water, and with your help, is determined to help relieve this pain. 

To help us address this issue, we’ve partnered with Wateraid, a non-profit organization to ensure that for every watch purchased, the gift of clean water will be provided to someone in need. A gift that can change a life forever.
~""Is the rich world aware of how four billion of the six billion live? If we were aware, we would want to help out, we'd want to get involved"" - Bill Gates~
By purchasing a Cloutier Nouvelle-France timepiece, not only will you be the proud owner of a beautiful unique vintage inspired swiss movement watch but will also be wearing a watch with a greater purpose and a story worth sharing.

How do we give? 






1. BUYCustomers purchase a Cloutier Nouvelle-France Watch.2. GIVEFor every watch purchased Cloutier Nouvelle-France will provide 25$ to WaterAid. Just 25$ can give one person access to clean, safe drinking water. Your purchase can change one life forever.3. BUILD100% of funds go toward supporting specific WaterAid projects in sub-Saharan Africa.WaterAid pools your gift with the gifts of others in order to meet the urgent need for clean water in a community or at a school, thereby helping hundreds or even thousands.4. PRACTICALWaterAid uses practical, locally-appropriate and cost-effective technologies so to ensure that operational maintenance requirements for the new water supply and sanitation facilities can be easily learned and adopted by local community members.5. SUSTAINABLEAll aspects of WaterAid’s projects are designed and implemented with long-term sustainability in mind.

Can 25$ really provide water for life to someone in need?There is a great deal of variation between projects due to considerations like country, region, access to markets, population to be served, type of water solution deemed to be locally appropriate etc.$25 covers the one-off set-up cost of water. It does not cover any ongoing costs, which are absorbed by the community through cost recovery programs that WaterAid help them to set-up and through support from local water utilities/offices.

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The idea behind the britome app.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>No matter what we’re looking for – we’ll find it on the internet at the best price! Anything?  What about the things you only get at a few stores worldwide and only instore because there are only a handful of pieces available ? You could, of course, try to get them via some auction platform for triple the price but wouldn’t it be much cooler  if you had a friend that lives around the corner of this shop, that simply gets the things for you? That would be great, I know, but what if you don´t know people that live in the city where the store is located? The idea I had was to build something like a dating platform but with the difference that on this platform,the users don´t fall in love with each other but do each other a favor by getting something for someone that is out of that person’s reach.</p>
<p>The idea of creating “britome” came to my mind while I was looking for a way to get the milk mag from Hong Kong (<a href=""http://www.milk.com.hk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.milk.com.hk</a>), because I´m collecting a lot of exotic stuff about streetwear. But there is no way of getting this magazine, with the value of a few bucks, on the internet or in a store in Germany. The only way to get the mag is to travel to Hong Kong or to find a friend who travels to Hong Kong but the best way to get it, is to know someone in Hong Kong!!!</p>
<p>Just check out the video above to get an idea of the app!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why I need your support and money!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I want to make the britome app more than a hobby and I want to work with people who give a 100% for this project. I‘ve worked with very talented people, who did their best to support me while having their regular job but it didn’t work out. I really want to create this app with experts in the background but if I ask for a 100% of their time, I need money to pay them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why I don’t get venture capital or something like that?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Trust me, I’ve tried it. The problem is that many VCs in Europe don´t want to invest in companies who are setting up something completely new and I think that’s the big difference between Europe and countries like the United States. But hey, if you’re a VC and are interested to invest in this campaign, you’re more than welcometo do so!</p>

<h4>Eco-friendly, Lightweight, &amp; Durable</h4>
<p>Bamboo is one of the most useful materials on earth and can be used to make just about anything! It's technically not a wood, but actually a grass which means it grows at much faster rate than it's hardwood counterparts. On top of that when bamboo is harvested it's cut at the stalk and then just starts regrowing again, unlike hardwood trees which need to be replanted and take between 30-50 years to grow to maturity. Bamboo truly is a renewable resource!</p>
<p>The first thing you'll notice when you pick up the Denver is how light it is. As soon as you wrap it around your wrist you'll forget it's even on (until someone compliments it that is). Weighing in at under 50g, it's one of the lightest watches on the market.</p>
<p>Not only is it amazingly light, but bamboo is incredibly durable. It's stronger than oak and is considered one of the most durable hardwoods, and unlike many hardwoods bamboo resists swelling so the watch will retain its shape.</p>
<p>So if you couldn't tell, we really like bamboo!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457674380/cm5swkl07pdj9bvwlm2q.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/></p>
<p>It's pretty simple, we have a rad bamboo watch, and we want you to help us make it. In order to have this watch produced we have to hit certain minimums with our factory and we believe crowdfunding is the best way to do it.<br/></p>
<p>Rather than getting a loan to purchase inventory and paying interest to those dirty no-good swindling bankers, we would rather raise the funds by offering a pre-sale of the Denver at an awesomely low price to you!</p>
<p>So here's how it works:<br/></p>
<ul> <li>The first 80 backers are the real MVP's. You will be able to purchase the Denver for only <b>$45</b>! These initial contributions will get the ball rolling for us. <br/>
</li>
<li>The next two tiers are 150 watches available at <b>$55</b>, and 200 watches available at <b>$65</b>.<br/>
</li> <li>We then use the funds from these three tiers to place an order with our factory<br/>
</li> <li>Lastly, if we don't hit our goal of <b>$9,000</b> then we don't make the watches, simple as that. <br/>
</li>
<li>Our campaign is limited to a total of <b>430 watches</b> to ensure prompt delivery, allow sufficient attention to detail and quality, and maintain a level of exclusivity.<br/>
</li>
</ul>So share the crap out of this campaign because the quicker we reach our goal the sooner we can start production and the sooner you can start wearing your Kanna watch!<ul> </ul> </div><div><br/></div> <div> <h3></h3>

<p>We can't make this awesome wrist candy without your help. In order to make this idea into a reality we need to raise enough to hit our factory minimum and we believe Indiegogo is the perfect platform to do just that. So here are some reasons why we think you should back the Denver:<br/></p> <ul> <li>You can be confident knowing that we are an already established brand with a history of quality products.<br/>
</li> <li>Our relationship and history with our manufacturer makes for very few surprises and confidence in the quality and timeliness of delivery.<br/>
</li> <li>Plain and simple; this watch is dope and is sure to be a conversation starter.</li> </ul>

But like anything, unexpected events can happen though we believe we have prepared ourselves to handle anything that comes our way by taking the following steps:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>Limiting the number of watches that we offer on pre-sale allows us to set more accurate and quicker delivery dates and gives us time to ensure each watch is inspected for quality and craftsmanship. </li>
<li>
Having an established relationship with our manufacturer gives us confidence in their quality and ability to hit deadlines.</li>
<li>We've lined up an established drop shipper in <b>ShipWire</b> to handle all shipping meaning professional packaging, handling and tracking for your order</li>
</ul>
<div>
<h4>Timeline</h4>
<p>Lucky for you everything has been designed, prototyped, tested and is ready for production so all we need is the capital to place the PO! Basically as soon as we hit our goal of $9,000 we can start production. It will take approximately 30 days to produce the watches, then we're budgeting for 15 days for handling, packaging, and delivering to you! <br/></p>
<p>Right now to be safe we are saying early June delivery, but that's assuming we take all 30 days to raise the target amount and allowing for two weeks of unforeseen delays. We believe this would be the latest delivery date, but if we can hit the target early then we can get a head start on production and have them delivered in early May! So the more you help us get the word out, the quicker you'll get your watch!</p>

It's that simple. A lot of Indiegogo campaigns will take your money regardless of if they hit their target, but not us.

<p><b>Is the Denver unisex?</b><br/>Absolutely! The Denver is the perfect size for men and women alike. The band is easily adjustable so it can be sized to any wrist.</p>
<p><b>What are my shipping options?</b><br/>In order to keep things simple and ensure we hit our delivery goals we are only shipping to the US, Canada, Europe, and Australia. The Denver will be available to ship worldwide after the crowdfunding period is over. Shipping cost will be determined at checkout depending on your address.</p>
<p><b>Who pays the customs fees on international shipments?</b><br/>Unfortunately we can't cover the cost of duties and taxes. You will be responsible for paying all duties. It can take up to 4 weeks to receive your order depending on the destination and the time it takes to clear customs so some patience may be required. Usually customs will contact you to pay duties so make sure you provide accurate contact information so that they can reach you! (i.e. phone number, email, etc.)<br/></p>
<p><b>Is there a warranty on my watch?</b><br/>Absolutely! Your watch comes with a 12 month limited warranty. See the details on our <a href=""http://www.kannawear.co/pages/warranty"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Warranty</a> page.</p>

</div></div>","We are Kanna Wear; a lifestyle accessories brand that provides stylish goods for the modern day explorer. The name Kanna means explore in Icelandic and it’s an idea that truly epitomizes the spirit of the brand. Whether it’s a mountain we’ve never skied, a band we’ve never heard, or a country we’ve never been to, Kanna explorers always try to take advantage of life’s unexpected opportunities. We've been around since 2014, making some of the finest wooden watches on the market and now we are looking to add a new style to our watch line with a little bit of your help.




We love wood watches, but don't always enjoy the look because they can be bulky and awkward due to the limitations of making the case from wood. Lucky for you we recognized this and decided we could make a better watch. 



The Denver is pretty much the best looking and most comfortable wood watch on the market with an incredible 2mm bezel, which for a wood watch is incredibly thin. 
The immaculate and damn near indestructible hardened Sapphire Crystal face runs practically off the edge like an infinity pool giving the Denver a very unique look. Most wood watches come with an easily scratch-able mineral glass, but we said to hell with that and tacked on a sapphire crystal just cause we can. Most watch companies charge over $150 for watches with sapphire crystals, but not us.



The black dial face is accented with matching black stainless steel crown, back plate, and pinch release clasp making it super easy to take on and off. The steel back plate eliminates the common issue of cracking. And behind that steel plate is a Japanese Quartz Miyota 2035 movement, one of the most reliable and accurate movements out there.














Eco-friendly, Lightweight, & Durable
Bamboo is one of the most useful materials on earth and can be used to make just about anything! It's technically not a wood, but actually a grass which means it grows at much faster rate than it's hardwood counterparts. On top of that when bamboo is harvested it's cut at the stalk and then just starts regrowing again, unlike hardwood trees which need to be replanted and take between 30-50 years to grow to maturity. Bamboo truly is a renewable resource!
The first thing you'll notice when you pick up the Denver is how light it is. As soon as you wrap it around your wrist you'll forget it's even on (until someone compliments it that is). Weighing in at under 50g, it's one of the lightest watches on the market.
Not only is it amazingly light, but bamboo is incredibly durable. It's stronger than oak and is considered one of the most durable hardwoods, and unlike many hardwoods bamboo resists swelling so the watch will retain its shape.
So if you couldn't tell, we really like bamboo!

   

It's pretty simple, we have a rad bamboo watch, and we want you to help us make it. In order to have this watch produced we have to hit certain minimums with our factory and we believe crowdfunding is the best way to do it.
Rather than getting a loan to purchase inventory and paying interest to those dirty no-good swindling bankers, we would rather raise the funds by offering a pre-sale of the Denver at an awesomely low price to you!
So here's how it works:
 The first 80 backers are the real MVP's. You will be able to purchase the Denver for only $45! These initial contributions will get the ball rolling for us. 

The next two tiers are 150 watches available at $55, and 200 watches available at $65.
 We then use the funds from these three tiers to place an order with our factory
 Lastly, if we don't hit our goal of $9,000 then we don't make the watches, simple as that. 

Our campaign is limited to a total of 430 watches to ensure prompt delivery, allow sufficient attention to detail and quality, and maintain a level of exclusivity.

So share the crap out of this campaign because the quicker we reach our goal the sooner we can start production and the sooner you can start wearing your Kanna watch!    

We can't make this awesome wrist candy without your help. In order to make this idea into a reality we need to raise enough to hit our factory minimum and we believe Indiegogo is the perfect platform to do just that. So here are some reasons why we think you should back the Denver:  You can be confident knowing that we are an already established brand with a history of quality products.
 Our relationship and history with our manufacturer makes for very few surprises and confidence in the quality and timeliness of delivery.
 Plain and simple; this watch is dope and is sure to be a conversation starter. 
   
As we've mentioned before wood watches are sort of our thing. But like anything, unexpected events can happen though we believe we have prepared ourselves to handle anything that comes our way by taking the following steps:
Limiting the number of watches that we offer on pre-sale allows us to set more accurate and quicker delivery dates and gives us time to ensure each watch is inspected for quality and craftsmanship. 

Having an established relationship with our manufacturer gives us confidence in their quality and ability to hit deadlines.
We've lined up an established drop shipper in ShipWire to handle all shipping meaning professional packaging, handling and tracking for your order


Timeline
Lucky for you everything has been designed, prototyped, tested and is ready for production so all we need is the capital to place the PO! Basically as soon as we hit our goal of $9,000 we can start production. It will take approximately 30 days to produce the watches, then we're budgeting for 15 days for handling, packaging, and delivering to you! 
Right now to be safe we are saying early June delivery, but that's assuming we take all 30 days to raise the target amount and allowing for two weeks of unforeseen delays. We believe this would be the latest delivery date, but if we can hit the target early then we can get a head start on production and have them delivered in early May! So the more you help us get the word out, the quicker you'll get your watch!


  
 One of the most important things about this specific Indiegogo is that if we don't hit our goal of $9,000, then we don't make the watches. It's that simple. A lot of Indiegogo campaigns will take your money regardless of if they hit their target, but not us. We want to make sure these watches are as good as they can be and we need to hit our target to do it.
So help us out and share the crap out of this campaign! Click one of the links on the left and make sure that your Denver watch gets made!




Is the Denver unisex?Absolutely! The Denver is the perfect size for men and women alike. The band is easily adjustable so it can be sized to any wrist.
What are my shipping options?In order to keep things simple and ensure we hit our delivery goals we are only shipping to the US, Canada, Europe, and Australia. The Denver will be available to ship worldwide after the crowdfunding period is over. Shipping cost will be determined at checkout depending on your address.
Who pays the customs fees on international shipments?Unfortunately we can't cover the cost of duties and taxes. You will be responsible for paying all duties. It can take up to 4 weeks to receive your order depending on the destination and the time it takes to clear customs so some patience may be required. Usually customs will contact you to pay duties so make sure you provide accurate contact information so that they can reach you! (i.e. phone number, email, etc.)
Is there a warranty on my watch?Absolutely! Your watch comes with a 12 month limited warranty. See the details on our Warranty page.
Is this watch waterproof?This watch is NOT waterproof. Bamboo is a living plant, which means it has pores. We could seal those pores up with a sealant, but that would negate all the awesome hypoallergenic properties that make bamboo so awesome. That being said the Denver can handle a little bit of water (we call it splashproof), but we do not recommend exposing it to excessive water or submerging it. The band and case can some moisture and will just swell slightly when exposed to moisture. But don't worry this swelling will go away eventually once the wood dries out. Unfortunately we can't cover water damage under the limited warranty, but let us know if you have issues and we can find a solution for you.
How do I change the battery?We recommend taking your watch to a jeweler or watch repair shop to have them change the battery as to avoid damaging the watch and voiding your warranty, but if you want to do it yourself simply remove the four screws on the back plate of the watch and inside you will be able to access the battery. 

ALLERGY DISCLAIMER Please note that The Denver is made from 100% bamboo. An allergic reaction to bamboo is very rare, but it can happen. We recommend that you monitor your skin to make sure you don't have any issues wearing bamboo (most don't). Note also that the clasp is stainless steel for those who have metal allergies.

<p>It is very important for us to only use the highest grade materials. But we also realized early on that we had to partner up with a Swiss manufacturer, if we wanted superior quality.</p>
<p>After an extensive search, we found the perfect match. A Swiss factory that would not only partner up with us, but also had comprehensive previous experience in assembling and regulating the specific movements we’re using.</p>
<p>For the heart of the watch, the movement, we decided to partner up with the Swiss watch movement manufacturer Sellita that has been making movements since the nineteen fifties. Sellita is based in La-Chaux-de-Fonds, which is considered to be the Swiss watch making industry centre. We chose Sellita because of their proven track record of accuracy and robustness throughout the years. Their movements are also very easy to service, which made our decision even easier.</p>

<p>Besides using the finest materials and working with industry leading suppliers and manufacturing partners, we guarantee the quality of our products by complying with high dimensional, technical and aesthetic parameters. Comprehensive test procedures to the different watch components are implemented throughout the manufacturing process. The quality control includes hundreds of different control points. Some of these are entry controls, water-resistance test, condensation test, airtightness test, automatic winding test, calendar operation test, power reserve test, 48h running test and craftsmanship of parts verifications.</p>
<p>An optical magnifying camera is used to guarantee the excellence of all external components. Before the watches are shipped out to you, a final aesthetic and functional control is carried out.</p>

<p><strong>Six screws exhibition caseback</strong></p>
<p>Six screws are used in order to secure the caseback. We did not settle with having a mineral glass caseback, but rather used thick sapphire crystal.

<p><strong>316L Stainless Steel</strong></p>
<p>We used fine 316L Stainless Steel for the case of our watch, as it’s known for its robustness, resistance to corrosion and staining, and low maintenance. Different steel polishing and brushing techniques are used to the different parts of the case, for a fully sophisticated look. The case is then plated by carefully applying a multi-layered PVD coating.</p>

<p>Both our indexes and hands are diamond cut in order to achieve the finest sharp shape. We work with hands and index makers that have been manufacturing them for decades.</p>

<p><strong>Sapphire Crystal (2x inner AR coating)</strong></p>
<p>What would a high-quality watch be without its outer protection? Sapphire crystal is ranking 9/10 on the MOHS Scale Of Hardness, which is as close to indestructible as you can get. </p>
<p>We wanted to provide glass that wouldn’t scratch. But we also wanted the glass to bring as little reflections as possible in order to add depth to the dial. As many of you may know, when adding an anti-reflective (AR) coating on the outside of the sapphire glass, it may easily be scratched, even if sapphire crystal is used underneath the coating. We solved this problem by putting a double layer AR-coating on the underside of the sapphire crystal. This results in a scratch proof glass, with less reflections.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536239419/c5alv1cg4nmft3mxu8ea.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Full-grain Italian calf leather straps (Calf, Suede and Alligator texture) with quick-release</strong></p>
<p>Our leather straps feature the finest Italian full-grain calf leather with different textures. In order for them to be easily interchangeable, we chose to include quick-release spring bars in all of our leather straps.<br/><br/>With minds full of curiosity about leather and its manufacturing process, we set out on a mission to find the finest full grain leather, which took us on a journey through many different tanneries. We knew we had found the right one when we came across a wonderful tannery in Tuscany, Italy. The tannery has been tanning leather for decades and had passed the tannery down through generations. The leather is not only durable, but also very soft and comfortable to wear, which was an extremely important aspect for us. All the leather straps are made by soft calf leather with different textures, and are made by hand in Italy by passionated master artisans.</p>
<p><strong>Different leather types:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Full-grain leather:</strong> Actually, there is nothing fancy or complicated about full-grain leather. It’s just the most natural form of leather, and that’s what we love about it. It is the least commonly used form of leather, because of its high price. Full-grain leather is the strongest and most durable part of the hide (skin), and it’s located just underneath the hair. Due to its tightness, it is very strong, but also very resistant to moisture. This is very important, especially when it comes to watch leather straps. Over time, full-grain leather also develops a gorgeous patina, which means that the leather straps will keep and develop their luster over time.</p>
<p><strong>Top-grain leather:</strong> Top-grain leather is very similar to full-grain leather. The difference is that the top layer is thinned down by a couple of millimeters. With the top layer sanded and buffed away, a lot of imperfections disappear and the leather becomes much more smooth. However, when removing the most tight top layer of the leather, it becomes less durable and breaks down faster. This is a commonly used leather type that features good quality, but it lacks top strength and durability, and can sometimes also have a generic appearance.</p>
<p><strong>Genuine leather:</strong> Genuine leather is the most popular leather used, at least for leather strap manufacturing. Not because of the quality, but rather because of its cheap price. It is made of an artificial grain that is applied to its surface. In order to increase the natural appearance of the leather, patterns are embossed into the surface and then sprayed with dyes or stain. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536239430/x9e5va7gxhynkw2gtkh8.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Stainless Steel Butterfly Buckle</strong></p>
<p>The leather strap features a butterfly buckle made of 316L Stainless Steel that opens with a light finger pressure. The advantage of a butterfly buckle is not solely that it looks great, but also that it’s very comfortable to wear as it forms the strap into a ring shape. This also avoids bending of the strap.</p>
<p>All of our straps will come with a separate butterfly buckle, even if you decide to purchase extra straps with your pledge.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536239716/zghkovzxjqnieetlampm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

Over time, full-grain leather also develops a gorgeous patina, which means that the leather straps will keep and develop their luster over time.
Top-grain leather: Top-grain leather is very similar to full-grain leather. The difference is that the top layer is thinned down by a couple of millimeters. With the top layer sanded and buffed away, a lot of imperfections disappear and the leather becomes much more smooth. However, when removing the most tight top layer of the leather, it becomes less durable and breaks down faster. This is a commonly used leather type that features good quality, but it lacks top strength and durability, and can sometimes also have a generic appearance.
Genuine leather: Genuine leather is the most popular leather used, at least for leather strap manufacturing. Not because of the quality, but rather because of its cheap price. It is made of an artificial grain that is applied to its surface. In order to increase the natural appearance of the leather, patterns are embossed into the surface and then sprayed with dyes or stain. 

Stainless Steel Butterfly Buckle
The leather strap features a butterfly buckle made of 316L Stainless Steel that opens with a light finger pressure. The advantage of a butterfly buckle is not solely that it looks great, but also that it’s very comfortable to wear as it forms the strap into a ring shape. This also avoids bending of the strap.
All of our straps will come with a separate butterfly buckle, even if you decide to purchase extra straps with your pledge.
