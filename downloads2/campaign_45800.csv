This means that even if we don’t completely reach our $20 000 financial goal, we will keep the money to produce. Therefore, the collection will be reduced to less designs to start. But don’t worry, this will allow us to invest our profits again afterwards. Let’s say that the process will be longer if we don’t reach our target within the assigned time.</p><p></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>When will I receive my perks ?</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Our manufacturing partners are standing by and excited to start producing Divine. Our manicurists are also ready to apply the Swarovski crystals onto the nails. As soon as our campaign ends, they will get to work. Allowing for 20 days to receive the funds we raised we can expect to have Divine delivered to you within 3 months after the end of the campaign.</p>
<p>A team of 50 employees will inspect your set and polish it to make sure it is in the best possible condition before mailing.</p>
<p>Our packing specialist from Colombia will light a candle and a hush will fall over the crowd as he put your press-on into the finest gold-lined box that money can buy.</p>
<p>We will all have a wonderful celebration and the whole party will march down the street to the post office where the entire town of Bogotá will wave “Bon Voyage!” to your package, on its way to you, in our private Divine jet ;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>How do I choose the designs I want ?</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>At the end of the campaign, we will send you a link to a page with a form to fill out where you can choose your designs.</p><p><b>What makes Swarovski crystals so special?</b></p><p>The method of production and processing of raw resources are important factors in the quality of finished crystals. Swarovski uses only the finest materials to fashion faceted lead glass that is known around the world for its brilliance and value. Superior production, materials, cutting, and polishing are what set Swarovski Crystals apart from other glass works.<br/></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>I’ve tried press-ons before and I am not sold. They look cheap and the application process is a pain, etc.</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>That’s because most nail companies are just selling you acrylic nails. We’re different. Our nails are made from high quality tips and provided with non-agressive adhesives (not glue!). Once you apply them, it really looks like natural nails. And it dries instantly. Plus, you can reuse them &amp; keep them safe in their protector box. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b>My nails are very short, round, long, etc. How do I know these will fit me ?</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>In each set, you will find your size among the 24 different units, for any type of nail you may have.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>How do I apply these nails ?</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>It’s easy! Just find your right fit in the box, apply the adhesives, press the nail on it <i>et voilà!</i></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>What do I do if I don’t want to take them off because they’re so comfortable and beautiful?</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Don’t panic, you’re not alone and no one will judge you. The only answer to your question is to make sure you applied them correctly as instructed to enjoy the most of your press-on manicure.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>What do I do if throngs of people follow me and try to steal my press-on manicure?</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Not surprising. We’ve seen it happen.The only solution here is to make sure these people have their own set. Divine are inexpensive and classy enough to make for pretty excellent gifts. Remember, they’re cheaper and last a whole longer than flowers or a chocolate box.</p><p></p><p><b>If my question isn’t answered, how do I ask ?</b></p><p>Just email Jean - <a href=""mailto:jean.diaz@unica-colombia.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">jean.diaz@unica-colombia.com</a> </p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p>

Share our campaign!The only way we'll reach our goal is if the word gets out about it. It may seem like an insignificant thing, but sharing our campaign on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn and all of the other awesome spots on the web, is priceless to us.

Divine is born from the following observations:                                                          Women are busy !An increasing majority of women are engaged in multiple roles of wife, mother, care taker, employee or entrepreneur; each requiring deep commitment.                        Women are busy, but still have a strong desire to look good !Looking good is not just about the appearance of one’s face. Nails represent a major aspect of our overall look and beauty, playing an equally important part as the hair, makeup & wardrobe looks.Nails and fashion are a dynamic duo and the once-unassuming manicure has become the most conspicuous fashion accessory.                      Products available are poorly executed & designs are boring !Innovation & creativity as our motto, we took the step-up to offer more than just drug-store press-on manicures.                                      - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Divine embodies French elegance, audacity and glamour. Divine stands for the conviction that beauty and function are complementary. With exceptional materials and overflowing imagination of our designers, we create our DNA. Designs express a marked personality and a sophisticated lifestyle. Moreover, we use the most precious rocks of Swarovski to captivate the power of elegance with simplicity and demand, our key words. The packaging, innovative and stylish, highlight the magic of the colors associated to the brightness of the crystals.Our brand identifies itself like a pioneer within the Colombian beauty industry. It differentiates itself by its limited and exclusive collections. Pleasant and efficient at the time, Divine’s nails act in perfect harmony with the hand and enrich the visual aspect, but looking natural.The woman Divine is full of life, glad, confident, universal and radiant. She finds her tendencies within the ultimate international Fashion catwalks. She gets inspiration from Paris, artistic effervescence symbol and place of creation & expression.                                                                                      Drop me a line!                                                                                          Let's connect!                                                                                           Send me some love!    Even if we are launching the business, we work with more than 20 year experimented providers. Plus, we are already very familiar with business management and we paid for all the expenses regarding R&D, certificates & prototypes needed.
But we understand that even with all of this, the risk cannot be totally erased.
Time is our biggest opponent. In the best situation, we will be able to provide you with the collection within 8 weeks after we receive the crowdfunding budget. In a pessimistic case, we will need 1 to 2 more week(s).Because we are a start-up, we are not capable of competing with $1 nail produced in huge quantity. Nevertheless, what we lose in price competition, we gain it in quality control, flexibility and making sure you get the best product we've found on the market. And believe us, we tried them all !If I want to contribute, what do I do ?There have been a lot of questions on this, so here we go !

I am an international backer, do I have to pay for shipping ?

No you don’t ! It's included :)

Which countries do you ship to?
We ship to more than 220 countries worldwide. If you are unsure that we ship to your country, please contact Jean at jean.diaz@unica-colombia.com and he will confirm.How can I participate to the referral contest ?Click here to learn more about our Indiegogo referral contest.What would happen if you don’t reach your financial goal ?We chose the « Flexible Funding » option. This means that even if we don’t completely reach our $20 000 financial goal, we will keep the money to produce. Therefore, the collection will be reduced to less designs to start. But don’t worry, this will allow us to invest our profits again afterwards. Let’s say that the process will be longer if we don’t reach our target within the assigned time.

When will I receive my perks ?

Our manufacturing partners are standing by and excited to start producing Divine. Our manicurists are also ready to apply the Swarovski crystals onto the nails. As soon as our campaign ends, they will get to work. Allowing for 20 days to receive the funds we raised we can expect to have Divine delivered to you within 3 months after the end of the campaign.
A team of 50 employees will inspect your set and polish it to make sure it is in the best possible condition before mailing.
Our packing specialist from Colombia will light a candle and a hush will fall over the crowd as he put your press-on into the finest gold-lined box that money can buy.
We will all have a wonderful celebration and the whole party will march down the street to the post office where the entire town of Bogotá will wave “Bon Voyage!” to your package, on its way to you, in our private Divine jet ;)


How do I choose the designs I want ?

At the end of the campaign, we will send you a link to a page with a form to fill out where you can choose your designs.What makes Swarovski crystals so special?The method of production and processing of raw resources are important factors in the quality of finished crystals. Swarovski uses only the finest materials to fashion faceted lead glass that is known around the world for its brilliance and value. Superior production, materials, cutting, and polishing are what set Swarovski Crystals apart from other glass works.

I’ve tried press-ons before and I am not sold. They look cheap and the application process is a pain, etc.

That’s because most nail companies are just selling you acrylic nails. We’re different. Our nails are made from high quality tips and provided with non-agressive adhesives (not glue!). Once you apply them, it really looks like natural nails. And it dries instantly. Plus, you can reuse them & keep them safe in their protector box. 

My nails are very short, round, long, etc. How do I know these will fit me ?

In each set, you will find your size among the 24 different units, for any type of nail you may have.

How do I apply these nails ?

It’s easy! Just find your right fit in the box, apply the adhesives, press the nail on it et voilà!

What do I do if I don’t want to take them off because they’re so comfortable and beautiful?

Don’t panic, you’re not alone and no one will judge you. The only answer to your question is to make sure you applied them correctly as instructed to enjoy the most of your press-on manicure.

What do I do if throngs of people follow me and try to steal my press-on manicure?

Not surprising. We’ve seen it happen.The only solution here is to make sure these people have their own set. Divine are inexpensive and classy enough to make for pretty excellent gifts. Remember, they’re cheaper and last a whole longer than flowers or a chocolate box.If my question isn’t answered, how do I ask ?Just email Jean - jean.diaz@unica-colombia.com

Built to last for a lifetime, handcrafted and burnished for a refined wallet any man will love.I always loved walking around in this old western store here in Ogden and looking at the western tack and saddlery. I don’t even have horses but the way the leather felt and looked really spoke to me.The process and the craft hasn’t changed over hundreds of years, I felt a real sense of nostalgia. I wanted to create that same feeling in a wallet. Something that you carry everyday that sends you back to a simpler time, an old world perspective when people only bought things that really mattered and would last a long time.  We set out to create the ultimate wallet to keep men’s most essential belongings safe. A no-compromises wallet that will stay with you for a lifetime. A wallet you can be proud of.All men carry a wallet, so it might as well be something with substantial quality and value. This wallet looks and functions as a classic weathered wallet should-- effortlessly and with a rugged, classic American style.   Don’t be afraid to get rough with our new Stock and Barrel Wallet. 100% made in America and hand-stitched from the best natural vegetable tanned leather, we guarantee this wallet will last you for years to come.There are many ways manufacturers cut corners and misrepresent their products regarding leather. At Stock and Barrel, we don't cut corners on the leather.All our products are made from very thick 3oz. vegetable-tanned full-grain harness leather. It is the best, strongest part of the hide. 
Vegetable, which uses vegetable-derived tannins from sources such as oak bark and takes about 60 days to process.
Chrome/oil tanned which uses really nasty carcinogenic and earth-killing chemicals, that only takes one to two days to make.
Aside from wanting to leave a better, healthier planet for our children, we use only vegetable-tanned leather because of the beautiful way it looks and ages.  Over a lifetime of use it will continue to darken and develop a beautiful and unique patina that the cheaper chrome-tanned leather never will.It has great durability and strength and with care can last several lifetimes. A wallet is only as strong as it’s weakest stitch. Which is why we’ve gone to great lengths to make sure we’re using the toughest thread out there. We use .040” inch WAXED polyester cord made in house by a brick and mortar business called The Maine Thread Company in Lewiston, Maine. We use a stitching method that stands the test of time, called the saddle stitch. In this stitch, the friction causes the wax on our polyester thread to melt and seals the stitch in it's place completely.    This company and it’s success means everything to our little family. We’ve poured our hearts into the brand and products and we’re ready to take our business to the next level. With your support, we’ll be able to invest in the much needed production equipment like; industrial stitching machines, clicker press, burnisher, splitter, etc…) that will not only improve our efficiency, but also allow us to create higher quality products.If the funding goes well beyond our expectations we’ll able to move our operation to a bigger space and one with a possible retail front. We would love to be able to sell our products in person and create more personal relationships with our customers. We're a family who breaks the mold of a traditional 9-5 work life, yet we're consumed in the art of a highly traditional craft of making quality leather goods. Stock and Barrel Co began in 2012 and has not only been a creative outlet for us, but has consistently been a source of ups, downs, cuts, calluses, tears and laughs. Many of our recent life milestones occurred right here in our workshop in Ogden, Utah. We've poured our heart and soul into this business and we take pride in each carefully crafted product.",31.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Let's Bring Good On You to North America</h2>

<p>Good On You is already making a difference with tens of thousands of people already using the app in Australia and New Zealand. </p>
<p><strong>$15,000 will fund the work needed to bring the app to North America in February 2017. </strong>This will cover tech updates and ratings for brands available in the US and Canada. Around 200 of those will be smaller and mid-sized ethical brands that consciously and actively address working conditions, environmental impacts, and animal issues.</p>
<p><strong>If we can reach $30,000</strong><strong> </strong> we will be able to rate even more brands. We'll also get to work on extending Good On You to include ratings for beauty and personal care brands – this is the most commonly requested addition from our existing users.</p>
<h3>What are the risks?</h3>
<p>They're pretty low. The Good On You app already exists. It's popular and works well in Australia and New Zealand. We've got a proven ethical brand rating methodology and a system for applying it. We're raising the money we need to pay our developer to tweak the app to suit North America but mostly we're raising money so we can rate more brands including the most popular and most ethical brands in the USA and Canada.</p>

<h3>How does Good On You make a difference?</h3>
<p>We know there are millions of people who want to ‘shop their values’. But it’s really hard to do that, especially in fashion. So as we make it easy, and millions of people start to prefer transparent brands that are doing better, the companies behind the brands that are not doing well will begin to feel it in the hip pocket. They’ll be forced to change.</p>
<p>We don’t expect or even need you to make the best ethical choice every time you shop - that’s just not realistic. But we do believe we can empower millions of people to make better choices to build a movement to create change.</p>
<h3>How can I get involved?</h3>
<p><strong>Spread the word</strong> - That’s the most important thing right now! Please share our campaign on social media or better still tell your friends directly in person!</p>
<p><strong>Volunteer</strong> - If you think you have something to offer as a researcher, writer or marketer, please let us know. </p>
<p><strong>Get your ethical brand listed </strong>- If you represent a brand that is trying to make a difference, get in touch with your details. We may already have you on the list of brands to be included but we'd love to hear from you. </p>

Do You Know The Real Cost of The Clothes We Wear?

Too often the clothes we buy come at an unacceptable price for the world’s poorest people, our environment, and animals.
We Have The Power to Create Change!
What if you could see exactly how brands treat their workers, the environment, and animals?
What if you could know that  every time you shop you are doing what you can to avoid association with sweatshops, child labor, environmental harm or animal exploitation?

 So What's Wrong with Fashion?

 
 

 


Let's Bring Good On You to North America
We want to bring the Good On You app to North America to empower millions of people to make a difference every time they shop.
Good On You is already making a difference with tens of thousands of people already using the app in Australia and New Zealand. 
$15,000 will fund the work needed to bring the app to North America in February 2017. This will cover tech updates and ratings for brands available in the US and Canada. Around 200 of those will be smaller and mid-sized ethical brands that consciously and actively address working conditions, environmental impacts, and animal issues.
If we can reach $30,000  we will be able to rate even more brands. We'll also get to work on extending Good On You to include ratings for beauty and personal care brands – this is the most commonly requested addition from our existing users.
What are the risks?
They're pretty low. The Good On You app already exists. It's popular and works well in Australia and New Zealand. We've got a proven ethical brand rating methodology and a system for applying it. We're raising the money we need to pay our developer to tweak the app to suit North America but mostly we're raising money so we can rate more brands including the most popular and most ethical brands in the USA and Canada.

Understanding what technical aspects the jeans need to hold up to, Steven worked with Cone Denim to create the perfect blend of cotton, wicking polyester, and elastic [stretch] for the RYB Denim. <br/><br/><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""></span></span></span></span><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=""notranlsate""></span><b>Designer: </b>Founder and head designer, Chandel Bodner, graduated with a degree in both Fashion Design and Fashion Marketing in 2006.

Teaming up with Pigeons &amp; Thread, a local group of garment engineers who have worked on everything from costume design to development programs for large jean brands, we were able to go from design to pattern and sample sizes with ease! As cyclists themselves, they brought a lot of creative fixes and personal knowledge to the project. It's important to us that we work with our community, are a part of the environment, and collaborate with our riding companions as much as possible. <br/></p>

Both, our fabric mill and manufacturer, have long histories of making premium denim goods. Having them close by means we can ensure that our quality and high standards are maintained throughout the production process.<br/></p>
<span class=""notranlsate""></span></span></span></span><b>Risks and Challenges: </b>While we have put together a team of the top designers, fabric makers, fit engineers, fabric mills and manufacturers there are still challenges we will face. We welcome these hurdles and have been inspired by the stories that we have heard from women around the world. Fit is a huge challenge for a jean that is meant for cycling movement, comfort and style. So as part of our project we have been fit testing samples with cyclists of all shapes and sizes for the past few months and have come up with a sizing and a fit that our team agrees is great for cycling and style. <span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""></span></span></span></span></span><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""></span></span></span></span></span></span><p><br/></p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><h3>How Do They Fit?<br/>

<p>We understand that not all women's bodies are shaped the same, and as a cyclist there can be physical attributes that are even more difficult to fit into typical jeans. RYB Denim jeans account for room in the waist, hip, thighs, knees, and calves. The size chart below corresponds to all of these measurements. It is important to look at the waist and hip measurements first, to match your size correctly. <br/></p>

""When I get on and off my bike I don’t have to readjust my jeans, they cup and they sit on your hips when you’re actually riding. Once I felt what it was like to ride with the seamless seat gusset I didn’t want to go back to my other pants and shorts. "" -Emily Heffring, Team rider and tester<br/></p>

This adds comfort and contributes to personalized fit over time. Yes, these jeans will fit you better every time you wear them!<br/><b><br/>What is a seat gusset? </b><br/>The unique seat gusset design, patent pending, is RYB Denim's answer to some of the health problems and discomfort that is caused by traditional center seam placement. The position of the gusset means that we've removed those bulky seams that hurt your ""lady bits""! <br/>We also double layer the fabric in the wear areas so the RYB Denim jeans are durable and last. <br/><br/><b>Why is RYB fabric better than typical denim?</b><br/>The average pair of jeans is made from denim that is mostly or all cotton fibers. Although cotton is comfortable and natural, it absorbs water and tends to loosen up over time without any memory fit [stretch back]. Cotton also wears through in high friction areas faster than technical sportswear fabrics. We have created a blended 11.5 oz denim to solve these concerns. The 34% polyester filament component to our denim provides security in it's strength, and with the moisture wicking treatment applied, the rider is sure to stay dry and comfortable.<br/><br/><span class=""notranlsate""></span><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><b>What if they don't fit?</b><br/>Make sure you've watched the video above on fit and sizing, and ask any questions you might have before selecting a size for yourself.<span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""></span></span></span></span></span><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""></span></span></span></span></span></span><p>These will not feel the same as any other pair of jeans.

Put a note in the comments section that it is a gift. We will send a gift card to the receiver and ask for their measurements. <br/><br/><b>I don't understand crowd-funding, what does it mean?</b><br/>Crowd-funded projects, like ours, are supported and become viable only with the contributions of it's funders. Funders view various start up companies, artists, entrepreneurs, charities, drives, etc and decide which ones they want to support and see become a real company or project. This is putting the power back in the hands [and wallets] of consumers and individuals all over the world! What better way to decide what is worth supporting and help be a part of making that happen! Our campaign offers perks in the way of our product and other enticing tangible items. We offer a range so that more individuals will consider supporting this at any amount or for any item listed.<br/><b><br/>What if RYB Denim doesn't meet it's funding goal?</b><br/>We have chosen a ""fixed funding"" goal, this means that if we do not reach our goal amount we will refund all of the contributors their support and this product will not be produced and the company will not move forward with enough to sustain it's growth potential. This is also why no order forms are sent to contributors until the end of the campaign, November 17, 2013.<br/><br/><b>Why did we choose ""fixed funding""?</b><br/>The apparel industry works in the chain of supplies timeline and production capabilities. RYB Denim has consulted Cone Denim to produce our specific, custom blend denim, but like many businesses, they will only provide to us in a minimum amount. Because of this, and the production costs, packaging, and shipping to come after material is ordered, we cannot provide these at any less than our funding goal.<br/><br/><b>What is a Stretch Goal?</b><br/>We will introduce various stretch goals to our campaign. These means that the original goal of $25,000, while amazing to reach, will really only let us produce this one style, in this one color, and do just the orders placed [thank you for these so far!]. But what happens next? We'd like the potential of our company to be supported by you out there as well! The more we can raise, the more we can do in the future. By introducing stretch goals we can give more options for you, and we can do more with RYB Denim in the future! <br/><br/><b>Are these jeans available in stores?</b><br/>Unfortunately, not yet! Part of our business plan is to offer these in stores around the world, but we can't do that if we don't reach our funding goal here. We do offer the Shop Owner/Boutique package so that retailers may support RYB Denim and provide their local customers with this new product in the cycling market! Share RYB Denim with your local shop or boutique store if you want to see these in various sizes in your city! <br/><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><p><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""></span></span></span></span></span></p>

""Ride Your Bike"" Denim

Whether you ride daily for work, out with friends, as sport or any other reason in between and beyond, wouldn't it be nice to know that your jeans feel great, look great, and will last? 
RYB Denim is focused on creating jeans for women that flatter your shape, breathe and stretch as you ride, and look great on and off your bike. 
A dream that is inspired by the growing number of women riding every where, every day, we need your help to make this a reality. 
Your contributions will help us provide female cyclist's around the world with a pair of jeans that will enhance the enjoyment and freedom they feel while riding their bike!
Why Are We Making These Jeans?


*Most jeans wear through in the seat and saddle area, usually very quickly after you start riding in them.
*The standard center seam placement in the seat makes them uncomfortable to sit on.*The back rise is generally too low and can expose you lower back..and even your butt..not good!
*There is not enough room designed for the movement of your thigh and calf muscles, and your knees.
*They lack other features that are benefits as you ride, like deeper pockets, a lock holder, a key holder, pocket placement, and reflective seam piping.RYB Denim Solutions

The RYB Denim jean design came about after talking to friends and fellow cyclists from around the world.
*The RYB jean has a one-of-a-kind, unique, double-reinforced seat gusset specifically designed to eliminate saddle wear. *The seat gusset design also removes that uncomfortable center seam
*A swooping waistband to increase coverage and comfort, higher in the back and comfortable in the front.*Adjusted pocket size placement on the back, and deeper front pockets with comfortable openings
*Technical and custom engineering of a premium denim to make a soft, durable, stretch denim that also wicks away moisture.
*Overall,
 the jean is designed to fit better in all the important areas while 
you’re cycling with extra benefits, like a built-in lock holder, 
reinforced belt loops, and reflective seam piping


***NOTE the seat gusset above is shown as production colors, we will be using matching colored stitching to ensure it is discreet and still functional
Where Does the Money Go?



The $25,000 goal will allow RYB Denim to produce our first run of the classic style we are offering. The funding will go to purchasing our custom crafted denim, manufacturing costs, and distribution of this premium quality jean. 
Any funds above and beyond our goal will allow us to take this project and turn it into a real company focused on producing quality garments for women who ride bikes. We'll be able to offer more styles, more colors, and in more places! 
How Are We Able to Make These Jeans?

The RYB Denim team has the experience of over 20 years in the garment industry and the skills to make great jeans. Combining forces and utilizing our strengths, we can confidently say our jeans are the best and only product on the market for women that allow you to ride in comfort, are durable, and fashionable jeans. 
The Fabric Mill: Our custom denim mill is Cone Denim. Cone Denim has been a leading supplier of denim fabrics to top denim apparel brands since 1891. Out of North Carolina, USA, Cone Denim worked with our fabric specialist to produce a unique and technical weave for RYB Denim.The Fabric Specialist: Steven Sal Debus has been a technical fabric developer and garment maker for over 15 years and has traveled the world investigating the best content mixes for sportswear and streetwear. Understanding what technical aspects the jeans need to hold up to, Steven worked with Cone Denim to create the perfect blend of cotton, wicking polyester, and elastic [stretch] for the RYB Denim. Designer: Founder and head designer, Chandel Bodner, graduated with a degree in both Fashion Design and Fashion Marketing in 2006. Her industry experience, technical ability, and personal connection to cycling give her the elements to create a product that is useful, culture-conscious, and promotes a healthy lifestyle. Product Development: Going from design ideas and drawings to the tangible product takes time, effort, and knowledge. Teaming up with Pigeons & Thread, a local group of garment engineers who have worked on everything from costume design to development programs for large jean brands, we were able to go from design to pattern and sample sizes with ease! As cyclists themselves, they brought a lot of creative fixes and personal knowledge to the project. It's important to us that we work with our community, are a part of the environment, and collaborate with our riding companions as much as possible. 
Keep It Local: We chose to make our denim in the USA and to manufacture in Canada. Both, our fabric mill and manufacturer, have long histories of making premium denim goods. Having them close by means we can ensure that our quality and high standards are maintained throughout the production process.
Risks and Challenges: While we have put together a team of the top designers, fabric makers, fit engineers, fabric mills and manufacturers there are still challenges we will face. We welcome these hurdles and have been inspired by the stories that we have heard from women around the world. Fit is a huge challenge for a jean that is meant for cycling movement, comfort and style. So as part of our project we have been fit testing samples with cyclists of all shapes and sizes for the past few months and have come up with a sizing and a fit that our team agrees is great for cycling and style. How Do They Fit?

Watch the video below to see how you should properly measure yourself to get the best fit for you in the RYB Denim jean. Ask a friend to help to make sure it's accurate! 

We understand that not all women's bodies are shaped the same, and as a cyclist there can be physical attributes that are even more difficult to fit into typical jeans. RYB Denim jeans account for room in the waist, hip, thighs, knees, and calves. The size chart below corresponds to all of these measurements. It is important to look at the waist and hip measurements first, to match your size correctly. 
The sizes listed below are the only sizes we are able to offer for this production run. If you would like to discuss a size not listed, please email us and we can talk about it! 

We are also offering two different lengths on the order form, regular and long. Regular length is 31""-33"" and long is 34""-36"".You don't have to decide on your exact size right away! Make a supportive contribution at any time, sizing will need to be decided at the end of the campaign deadline, that is when you will receive your order form. Plenty of time to ask questions you might have. Please contact us and we'd be happy to help you understand the fit and sizing best for you! Perks!!!
Here are some images of the perks you get for contributing! Thank you for your support and we hope that you enjoy your new pair of jeans, tee, saddle, and smile!

Frequently Asked Questions


Are they comfortable?The biggest question that women everywhere are going to ask is, “Are they comfortable?”.The answer is: Yes, they are absolutely comfortable and they move and stretch as you do. ""When I get on and off my bike I don’t have to readjust my jeans, they cup and they sit on your hips when you’re actually riding. Once I felt what it was like to ride with the seamless seat gusset I didn’t want to go back to my other pants and shorts. "" -Emily Heffring, Team rider and tester
Does the fabric stretch?Our custom-made 11.5 oz. denim has 2% spandex and moisture wicking polyester filaments that, when combined, add stretch to the denim. This adds comfort and contributes to personalized fit over time. Yes, these jeans will fit you better every time you wear them!What is a seat gusset? The unique seat gusset design, patent pending, is RYB Denim's answer to some of the health problems and discomfort that is caused by traditional center seam placement. The position of the gusset means that we've removed those bulky seams that hurt your ""lady bits""! We also double layer the fabric in the wear areas so the RYB Denim jeans are durable and last. Why is RYB fabric better than typical denim?The average pair of jeans is made from denim that is mostly or all cotton fibers. Although cotton is comfortable and natural, it absorbs water and tends to loosen up over time without any memory fit [stretch back]. Cotton also wears through in high friction areas faster than technical sportswear fabrics. We have created a blended 11.5 oz denim to solve these concerns. The 34% polyester filament component to our denim provides security in it's strength, and with the moisture wicking treatment applied, the rider is sure to stay dry and comfortable.What if they don't fit?Make sure you've watched the video above on fit and sizing, and ask any questions you might have before selecting a size for yourself.These will not feel the same as any other pair of jeans. Do not compare them with any other jeans you have owned. They are specifically designed to be different to fit you on your bike better than anything you could currently own.
Get on your bike and ride. 
If you feel these do not fit you we can exchange them for a different size. No problem.What if I buy them as a gift and I can't take the giftee's measurements?No problem. Put a note in the comments section that it is a gift. We will send a gift card to the receiver and ask for their measurements. I don't understand crowd-funding, what does it mean?Crowd-funded projects, like ours, are supported and become viable only with the contributions of it's funders. Funders view various start up companies, artists, entrepreneurs, charities, drives, etc and decide which ones they want to support and see become a real company or project. This is putting the power back in the hands [and wallets] of consumers and individuals all over the world! What better way to decide what is worth supporting and help be a part of making that happen! Our campaign offers perks in the way of our product and other enticing tangible items. We offer a range so that more individuals will consider supporting this at any amount or for any item listed.What if RYB Denim doesn't meet it's funding goal?We have chosen a ""fixed funding"" goal, this means that if we do not reach our goal amount we will refund all of the contributors their support and this product will not be produced and the company will not move forward with enough to sustain it's growth potential. This is also why no order forms are sent to contributors until the end of the campaign, November 17, 2013.Why did we choose ""fixed funding""?The apparel industry works in the chain of supplies timeline and production capabilities. RYB Denim has consulted Cone Denim to produce our specific, custom blend denim, but like many businesses, they will only provide to us in a minimum amount. Because of this, and the production costs, packaging, and shipping to come after material is ordered, we cannot provide these at any less than our funding goal.What is a Stretch Goal?We will introduce various stretch goals to our campaign. These means that the original goal of $25,000, while amazing to reach, will really only let us produce this one style, in this one color, and do just the orders placed [thank you for these so far!]. But what happens next? We'd like the potential of our company to be supported by you out there as well! The more we can raise, the more we can do in the future. By introducing stretch goals we can give more options for you, and we can do more with RYB Denim in the future! Are these jeans available in stores?Unfortunately, not yet! Part of our business plan is to offer these in stores around the world, but we can't do that if we don't reach our funding goal here. We do offer the Shop Owner/Boutique package so that retailers may support RYB Denim and provide their local customers with this new product in the cycling market! Share RYB Denim with your local shop or boutique store if you want to see these in various sizes in your city! 


What if I can't afford a pair of RYB cycling jeans? Think of it as a long term investment in a pair of jeans that will work better than what you've had in the past.

Hier sind einige Punkte, die du in diesem Abschnitt beachten solltest:  Stelle dich und deinen Hintergrund vor. Beschreibe deine Kampagne kurz und knackig und erkläre, weshalb sie so wichtig für dich ist. Beschreibe, wobei die Unterstützer dir helfen werden.  Denke daran, dich kurz zu halten. Stelle dir folgende Fragen: Wenn jemand hier aufhört zu lesen, wäre derjenige dann bereit, Geld zu geben?   Was du uns gibst & was du bekommst Gehe etwas mehr ins Detail für alle Besucher, die daran interessiert sind:  Erkläre, wie viel Geld du benötigst und wofür es eingesetzt wird. Bleib transparent und sag konkret, worum es geht - die Leute sollen dir und deiner Kampagne vertrauen.  Erzähle den Leuten von deinen einzigartigen Perks. Mach sie neugierig! Erkläre, wohin die Finanzmittel gehen, wenn du das Funding-Ziel nicht erreichst.    Die Folgen Verrate mehr über deine Kampagne und lass die Leute wissen, was sie mit ihrem Beitrag bewirken:  Erkläre, warum dein Projekt für den Unterstützer und die Welt wichtig ist. Erwähne ähnliche Projekte, mit denen du in der Vergangenheit erfolgreich warst (falls es welche gibt). Mach das Projekt für die Leute real und baue Vertrauen auf.    Risiken & Herausforderungen  Die Leute schätzen deine Transparenz. Bleib offen und stich aus der Masse heraus, indem du ohne Umschweife von den Risiken und Hindernissen erzählst, die dir auf dem Weg zum Erreichen deines Ziels begegnen.  Informiere deine Unterstützer, warum gerade du diese Hürden überwinden wirst. Beschreibe, wie du diese Herausforderungen bewältigen möchtest.    Andere Wege, wie man helfen kann Manche können einfach keinen Beitrag leisten, das heißt aber nicht, dass sie nicht helfen können:  Bitte darum, dass man über deine Kampagne spricht und sie so bekannt macht. Erinnere daran, das Tool von Indiegogo dafür zu nutzen!   Das war es auch schon.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

Indeed, though Chinese watchmaking is extremely developed and most watches today are made in China, few are willing to say it and even fewer to celebrate it.At Atelier Wen, we have created watches that truly pay homage to Chinese watchmaking prowess. More than that, they are an attempt to bring you along a voyage of our vision of China; a China that is colourful, meaningful and full of poetry.Ji's blue porcelain, resplendent on this quiet Beijing morningHao's pure white contrasts against the Forbidden City's vivid redView of the case-back in front of Beijing's famous CCTV towerThe team behind Atelier Wen (from top left to bottom right: Robin Tallendier, Wilfried Buiron, Li Mingliang, Liu Yuguan)Going over technical drawingsWell-deserved rest after a 16 hour train ride to visit our movement manufacturer in the north of ChinaStudying our case-back design with a manufacturer.

En effet, bien que l’horlogerie chinoise soit très développée aujourd’hui, et que la majorité des montres soient, à vrai dire, faites en Chine, peu veulent l’admettre, et encore moins veulent le célébrer. Avec Atelier Wen, nous avons créé des montres rendant véritablement hommage au savoir-faire horloger chinois.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My Etsy team, The Milliners of Etsy, is a large part of my life. It's a group of over 375 milliners from all over the world. We've managed to build a strong community where milliners are committed to sharing everything that they know with each other so that we can help to make the art of hat making flourish. They are also friends, and we have shared some of our deepest sorrows and joys with each other.</p>
<p>On June 9, at the Acorn Theater in Three Oaks Michigan, we will have the first physical gathering of members. We are producing a fashion show featuring the lines of almost twenty members from around the United States. Members from as far as the UK, Australia and Israel who can't make it to the event are sending a single hat to a show that will have some of the finest millinery the world has to offer.</p>
<p>This event will put up and coming milliners like Amanda Joyner of Chef Bizzaro on equal footing with established professionals like Karen Morris and Jenny Pfanensteil of Formé Millinery. In this way, we will be truly sharing our art and audience with each other and with potentially thousands of others, as the event gets shared with the friends and followers of the rest of the group. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $1000 to help with printing costs. While ticket sales themselves can help costs that occur at the event, printing must be paid before. We must be able to supply the theater with posters, to print formal invitations for the VIPs, and to send postcards to every possible audience member. Each member that is showing their collection will receive an ample supply for their own mailing lists. </p>
<p>Besides, they're really beautiful. </p>
<p>Go and see them in their full glory at our website: <a href=""http://www.themillinersofetsy.com/posters-for-sale/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.themillinersofetsy.com/posters-for-sale/</a></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
My Etsy team, The Milliners of Etsy, is a large part of my life. It's a group of over 375 milliners from all over the world. We've managed to build a strong community where milliners are committed to sharing everything that they know with each other so that we can help to make the art of hat making flourish. They are also friends, and we have shared some of our deepest sorrows and joys with each other.
On June 9, at the Acorn Theater in Three Oaks Michigan, we will have the first physical gathering of members. We are producing a fashion show featuring the lines of almost twenty members from around the United States. Members from as far as the UK, Australia and Israel who can't make it to the event are sending a single hat to a show that will have some of the finest millinery the world has to offer.
This event will put up and coming milliners like Amanda Joyner of Chef Bizzaro on equal footing with established professionals like Karen Morris and Jenny Pfanensteil of Formé Millinery. In this way, we will be truly sharing our art and audience with each other and with potentially thousands of others, as the event gets shared with the friends and followers of the rest of the group. 


What We Need & What You Get
We need $1000 to help with printing costs. While ticket sales themselves can help costs that occur at the event, printing must be paid before. We must be able to supply the theater with posters, to print formal invitations for the VIPs, and to send postcards to every possible audience member. Each member that is showing their collection will receive an ample supply for their own mailing lists. 
Besides, they're really beautiful. 
Go and see them in their full glory at our website: http://www.themillinersofetsy.com/posters-for-sale/

<p>My name is Jenny Lee Maas owner of JLMaas.  I come from a mixed media 
background of fine art and design, which I bring into my fashion designs.<br/></p>
<p>I am hoping to raise money to help me not only get to NYC fashion week but also bring the best possible collection I can make.  With funds raised, I could hire an assistant on my more ambitious garments.<br/></p>
<p>This opportunity is important to me because it will give my design a whole new platform to be seen and has the potential to lead to many other opportunities.  <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <ul>
<li>My goal is to raise $4000.00.  This money would go to the production of the work itself (fabric, assistants) and show costs (fees, travel)<br/>
</li>
<li>If I don't reach my goal I will work with whatever I receive.  Any help is a blessing :)</li>
<li>Perks!<br/>
</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <ul>
<li>This opportunity will allow my work to be seen by an international audience, opening more doors for opportunity and success. <br/>
</li> <li>I recently had my first fashion show at Atlantic City Fashion week, it was successful but everything was done myself.  I would love to be able to hire an assistant to help with complicated dresses and have more funds to obtain high end fabrics.</li>
</ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>The risks and challenges are to create the best garments I have ever made.  To use them as a launch pad for my brand, my business and my future.  Having some funds to work with would give me the boost I need for:<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Fabrics</li>

</div> <p>Thank you so much :)<br/></p></div>","Short Summary
My name is Jenny Lee Maas owner of JLMaas.  I come from a mixed media 
background of fine art and design, which I bring into my fashion designs.
I am hoping to raise money to help me not only get to NYC fashion week but also bring the best possible collection I can make.  With funds raised, I could hire an assistant on my more ambitious garments.
This opportunity is important to me because it will give my design a whole new platform to be seen and has the potential to lead to many other opportunities.  
  What We Need & What You Get 
My goal is to raise $4000.00.  This money would go to the production of the work itself (fabric, assistants) and show costs (fees, travel)

If I don't reach my goal I will work with whatever I receive.  Any help is a blessing :)
Perks!
 
  The Impact 
This opportunity will allow my work to be seen by an international audience, opening more doors for opportunity and success. 
 I recently had my first fashion show at Atlantic City Fashion week, it was successful but everything was done myself.  I would love to be able to hire an assistant to help with complicated dresses and have more funds to obtain high end fabrics.

  Risks & Challenges  
The risks and challenges are to create the best garments I have ever made.  To use them as a launch pad for my brand, my business and my future.  Having some funds to work with would give me the boost I need for:

Fabrics
Assistants

Other miscellaneous materials (threads, beads etc.)

<p>You can also access the bottom chevron to fully extend the cable that plugs into your device. It's not required, but gives you a wider range of motion for carrying a device in your hand, a purse at your side, or a pocket.</p>

<p>Our team has finished the hardest parts of developing The Dipper with our factory partner and it's ready for production. We're currently just making a few minor tweaks to improve the experience even more. We believe in building a product that women will absolutely love, so we look forward to hearing the feedback of our backers during this campaign, as well.</p>
<p>Unlike many other companies at the crowdfunding stage, we’ve already done the work of finding a reputable manufacturer and developed our product in collaboration with their engineers, so tooling and production can begin as soon as we have the funds.</p>

<p>We’ve intentionally started with simple product features that allow us to execute with minimal challenges. Issues that lie ahead are most likely to happen when testing the first samples. If we discover any issues, we’ll be sure to notify our backers immediately and even seek your feedback.</p>
<p>We have so much love for our supporters and plan share our progress with you each step of the way!</p>

<p>In seven months, we’ve managed to get this project to a stage that takes many hardware companies <i>years</i> to achieve. The Tinsel team is fully dedicated to bringing The Dipper to life, and has carefully stretched our starter funds to get it this far. </p>

<p><span><b>What is Tinsel?</b></span></p>
<p>Tinsel is the name of our company and the products we make. We’re building a tech jewelry piece that integrates the full functionality of headphones into a beautiful necklace.</p>
<br/><p><b>How much will it cost after Indiegogo?</b></p>
<p>After our Indiegogo launch, The Dipper audio necklace will retail at $199. </p>
<br/><p><b>Does it have Bluetooth?</b></p>
<p>The Dipper is not Bluetooth enabled. Though we look forward to adding wireless necklaces in future collections, we don’t want you to worry about charging and syncing your jewelry just yet!</p>
<br/><p><b>Does it do any activity tracking/notifications/etc?</b></p>
<p>Right now we are laser-focused on creating a beautiful, luxurious necklace with amazing audio quality. That said, we hope to add more functionality to future jewelry based on what Tinsel customers want and need.</p>
<br/><p><b>What’s it made of?</b></p>
<p>The necklace pendant and necklace clasp is made from aluminum to keep it lightweight for all day wear. The chains are made from stainless steel. The remote and earbuds are made of plastic.</p>
<br/><p><b>Does it come with a jack that plugs into your phone?</b></p>
<p>Yes!!! And that means you can use it with any device that has a standard 3.5mm audio connection.</p>
<br/><p><b>Can you talk on the phone with it or listen to audio only?</b></p>
<p>Yes! The Dipper has a microphone and 3-button remote control, so you can talk on the phone, listen to music, podcasts...all the things you could do with other headphones, but in style. ;)</p>
<br/><p><b>Does it come in other sizes/lengths/styles?</b></p>
<p>The Dipper comes in one size and length, available in two color finishes: 24K gold-plated and gunmetal (both with touch of silver). </p>
<br/><p><b>How good is the audio quality/sound?</b></p>
<p>We will have sound quality that rivals your favorite audio brands - the electronics inside will be high quality, and they will be tuned for great, balanced sound.</p>
<br/><p><b>What is WAM and why should I donate to them?</b></p>Women’s Audio Mission (WAM) is a non-profit changing the face of sound by educating and providing opportunities to girls and women in audio engineering, music production and recording arts. Women are chronically underrepresented in these areas (less than 5%), and Tinsel is inspired by their mission to level the playing field of women in tech. With your donation, we will put $20 towards the purchase of audio necklaces for their staff and students. <br/>

You can also access the bottom chevron to fully extend the cable that plugs into your device. It's not required, but gives you a wider range of motion for carrying a device in your hand, a purse at your side, or a pocket.

Our team has finished the hardest parts of developing The Dipper with our factory partner and it's ready for production. We're currently just making a few minor tweaks to improve the experience even more. We believe in building a product that women will absolutely love, so we look forward to hearing the feedback of our backers during this campaign, as well.
Unlike many other companies at the crowdfunding stage, we’ve already done the work of finding a reputable manufacturer and developed our product in collaboration with their engineers, so tooling and production can begin as soon as we have the funds.







Our team has veterans who have developed many electronic and audio products, so we’ve avoided many pitfalls that new hardware startups face.
We’ve intentionally started with simple product features that allow us to execute with minimal challenges. Issues that lie ahead are most likely to happen when testing the first samples. If we discover any issues, we’ll be sure to notify our backers immediately and even seek your feedback.
We have so much love for our supporters and plan share our progress with you each step of the way!







In seven months, we’ve managed to get this project to a stage that takes many hardware companies years to achieve. The Tinsel team is fully dedicated to bringing The Dipper to life, and has carefully stretched our starter funds to get it this far. 
Now, we need your help to take the next step. Your support will allow us to start manufacturing so we can make our audio necklace a reality. What you are seeing are our prototypes --  the final product will be even better than what we have today.
Armed with your contributions and about 6 months time, we can have The Dipper around your neck in April 2016 (hello, festival season!).








Every dollar counts! If you can’t buy The Dipper today, give what you can and help us out by telling everyone you know about Tinsel. Use the sharing links to the left to spread the word! 







Aniyia Williams and Monia Santinello founded Tinsel with the belief that women deserve better when it comes to their tech. We started by trying to solve the pain points of a product we all know and find useful -- headphones -- and brought together a team to help us bring the project to life.
We are so proud to have a group that's incredibly cohesive and diverse. From those of us with years of experience in product development, manufacturing and industrial design, to years of experience in marketing, branding, operations and sales - we are all united by our passion to build beautiful well-made products.








What is Tinsel?
Tinsel is the name of our company and the products we make. We’re building a tech jewelry piece that integrates the full functionality of headphones into a beautiful necklace.
How much will it cost after Indiegogo?
After our Indiegogo launch, The Dipper audio necklace will retail at $199. 
Does it have Bluetooth?
The Dipper is not Bluetooth enabled. Though we look forward to adding wireless necklaces in future collections, we don’t want you to worry about charging and syncing your jewelry just yet!
Does it do any activity tracking/notifications/etc?
Right now we are laser-focused on creating a beautiful, luxurious necklace with amazing audio quality. That said, we hope to add more functionality to future jewelry based on what Tinsel customers want and need.
What’s it made of?
The necklace pendant and necklace clasp is made from aluminum to keep it lightweight for all day wear. The chains are made from stainless steel. The remote and earbuds are made of plastic.
Does it come with a jack that plugs into your phone?
Yes!!! And that means you can use it with any device that has a standard 3.5mm audio connection.
Can you talk on the phone with it or listen to audio only?
Yes! The Dipper has a microphone and 3-button remote control, so you can talk on the phone, listen to music, podcasts...all the things you could do with other headphones, but in style. ;)
Does it come in other sizes/lengths/styles?
The Dipper comes in one size and length, available in two color finishes: 24K gold-plated and gunmetal (both with touch of silver). 
How good is the audio quality/sound?
We will have sound quality that rivals your favorite audio brands - the electronics inside will be high quality, and they will be tuned for great, balanced sound.
What is WAM and why should I donate to them?Women’s Audio Mission (WAM) is a non-profit changing the face of sound by educating and providing opportunities to girls and women in audio engineering, music production and recording arts. Women are chronically underrepresented in these areas (less than 5%), and Tinsel is inspired by their mission to level the playing field of women in tech. With your donation, we will put $20 towards the purchase of audio necklaces for their staff and students.",33.0,0,"1 Campaign

Free Domestic Ground Shipping within the United States. For International Shipping, please add $20 to your contribution via Paypal.
PLEASE NOTE: the customer is always responsible for taxes and duties levied upon delivery and these costs will NOT be reflected in your purchase on Indiegogo.


Q5. Is there a warranty?
You will receive our standard 1-year warranty. Wear and tear is excluded from this policy.

Q6.  Is there a number for Customer Service?
Nooka is a small company with one employee dedicated to customer service. Because of this, email is the most efficient way to resolve issues with an online order. We understand that this can be frustrating for some customers, but please bear with us. We are striving to improve customer experience as we grow. (service@nooka.com)

Additionally, I wanted to give buyers the combination of a high quality mechanical movement, a slim case and affordable price tag.Note - All photos below are of the pre-production samples of the Flinders and are not renders.After many hours of research, I decided on the top grade Miyota Cal. 9015 self-winding mechanical movement to be the heart of the Flinders. This 24 jewel automatic movement operates at 28,800 BPH and has a power reserve of 42 hours when fully wound. Miyota is a subsidiary of Citizen watches and is known for producing high quality, accurate and reliable mechanical movements.The case for the Flinders is a high grade 316L stainless steel with a slim case height of only 9.8mm. This will allow the Flinders to be easily slipped under a shirt cuff for use with a suit, or to simply be comfortable for everyday wear. The Flinders caseback features a sapphire glass display which will show off the Miyota movement as it ticks away. The caseback itself is engraved with the text ""Flinders Automatic Movement Stainless Steel"" and also features our company logo and a serial number.Note - The sample case back shows the logo incorrectly positioned as the engineering team were forced to move the screw positions. The production case back will be changed for a neater look.The dial is multi-layered and features a guilloche centre and stainless steel markers. The date will be shown at the 3 o'clock position.

<p><b>Are you Looking for a pair of underwear that will literally change
your life?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Can you believe it?</p>
<p>The Riparo
Indiegogo Campaign is almost finished!</p>
<p>The ride has
been incredible and with-out you, this would not be possible.</p>
<p>If you are the
kind of man who always <b>wants the best</b>, it only makes sense to extend that
desire to your underwear. The world of men's underclothing has come a long way
in recent years, and today you can find contemporary styles to suit even the
most discriminating tastes.</p>
<p>What you wear
under your clothes is just as important as any other part of your wardrobe,
whether or not you are the only person who sees it. <b>Underwear is probably the
single most functional garment you put on every day</b> and one of the most
important factors in whether you feel comfortable in your clothes. </p>
<p>Whether you're a
boxers, boxer briefs, or briefs type of dude, your underwear is

<p>Maybe you're

cottons and silks surrounding your undercarriage.</p>
<p>I don’t know
about you, but I don’t compromise on quality and comfort and safety with the
things we wear every day. A pair of jeans, maybe. But not undies. And a day
decked out in a pair of Riparo is a fine day indeed. Roomy or snug,
cozy or lacy, plain or funky: They’re just cool, quality threads that feel good
and look and are the worlds ultimate underwear. </p>

</b></b></div>","Are you Looking for a pair of underwear that will literally change
your life?

Can you believe it?
The Riparo
Indiegogo Campaign is almost finished!
The ride has
been incredible and with-out you, this would not be possible.
If you are the
kind of man who always wants the best, it only makes sense to extend that
desire to your underwear. The world of men's underclothing has come a long way
in recent years, and today you can find contemporary styles to suit even the
most discriminating tastes.
What you wear
under your clothes is just as important as any other part of your wardrobe,
whether or not you are the only person who sees it. Underwear is probably the
single most functional garment you put on every day and one of the most
important factors in whether you feel comfortable in your clothes. 
Whether you're a
boxers, boxer briefs, or briefs type of dude, your underwear is
probably the most important thing to stock up on for your wardrobe.
You can never have enough pairs. After all, they're all that separate your
junk from a cruel world that's full of flying projectiles, unwanted thirst, and
other things that'll mess up your day/night/life if they come into contact with
your schmanging area.
Maybe you're
fine copping the cheapest underwear out there so you can splurge on various
grails. But if you do that, you should probably replace a couple pairs every
few months anyway. Even if you're the type of guy who'll only settle the finest
cottons and silks surrounding your undercarriage.
I don’t know
about you, but I don’t compromise on quality and comfort and safety with the
things we wear every day. A pair of jeans, maybe. But not undies. And a day
decked out in a pair of Riparo is a fine day indeed. Roomy or snug,

<p>ViroMasks was born out of passion to provide better and more effective solution to the raging pandemic across the globe. Facemasks in the current form were designed back in the 1930s; there is a need to disrupt the market and make more durable usable facemasks to reduce the carbon footprint, increase effectiveness and reduce the current as well as future air borne infections. </p>
<h3>Technology</h3>
<p>ViroMask uses HeiQ Viroblock; a Swiss technology to neutralize viruses on the surface. Viroblock is tested in Peter Doherty Institute of Infection and Immunity in University of Melbourne, Australia and proven to neutralize 99.98% of SARS-CoV-2 virus within 30 mins. Possibly the world most efficient technology to rapidly neutralize coronavirus. The technology has two components; Silver Ions and Vesicle Structures to rapidly neutralize enveloped viruses. </p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/aeXn1Up_qdE?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>ViroMasks uses patent-pending cup shaped design to ensure that only filtered air comes through. Sides are made of 100% ultra soft polyester to ensure no air passes through. The center pockets filter which is made of the same active layers as N95 respirator. </p>
<p><u>Aluminum<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> Noose Clip</span></u></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">ViroMasks keeps wearer’s safety and comfort paramount at each step of design. ViroMasks incorporates an aluminum flat noose clip that can easily be molded onto the wearer’s face shape. The shape is then maintained over a long period of time; ensuring proper fit onto the wearer’s face and minimal to no air leakage.</span></p>
<p><u>Adjustable Ear Loops</u></p>
<p>ViroMasks keeps the wearers comfort and protection as its priority. Our ear loops are made of elasticated polyester which helps give it that stretch around the ear and provides comfort over a long period of use. </p>
<p>The safety provided by any mask depends on its fit on the wearer’s face. ViroMasks has incorporated a cord system to help wearer adjust the size to ensure the mask fits well providing the desired safety. </p>
<p><u>Exhale Breathing Valves (Only in ViroMasks Vault)</u></p>
<p>ViroMasks Vault feature 2x Breathing Valves. Breathing valves are for exhale only. Their primary reason for being part of ViroMasks is: </p>
<ul>
<li>Help mitigate the heat buildup in the mask </li>
<li>Help mitigate Carbon dioxide buildup in the mask </li>
</ul>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Filtration (Vault and Armor)</h3>
<p>ViroMasks Armor and Vault both have advanced filtration. The middle area has a pocket where the filters can be replaced. The average lifespan of a filter is 100 hours of active use. Both Armor and Vault come with 3 filters in the pack and additional filter packs can be bought. </p>
<p>ViroMasks has a statically charged melt blown non-woven fabric filter. Melt blown filters above 95% particulates in the air at 0.3 Micron level. </p>
<ul>
<li>ViroMasks Melt blown is statically charged </li>
<li>Viruses have a slightly positive charge </li>

<h3>Sustainability</h3>
<p>Do you know that most masks (surgical and respirators) have a plastic layer that takes over 400 year to biodegrade naturally? Who wants to see our oceans full of masks in a couple of years time ? Get your ViroMasks; enjoy the same level of protection and lower cost per usage. </p>

<h3>Self Contamination</h3>
<p>ViroMasks neutralizes germs and viruses on the surface within 30 mins; so the chances of self-contamination are reduced. Any residue on the mask is rendered ineffective within a short span of time. So if you touch your mask and then your face (it is not recommended) but it will be safer compared to other masks. </p>
<h3>Limit Transmission</h3>
<p>ViroMasks neutralizes or kills the virus on contact; unlike other masks that just trap the virus which can then bounce off to the weakest link. </p>

<h3>Future of FaceMasks</h3>
<p>The world will continue to use face masks for a considerable number of years in the future. We have seen in the previous pandemics; facemasks were very efficient in curbing the spread. This time around sadly; a big part of our disposable facemasks is made of plastic; which will not degrade quickly (unlike cotton). </p>
<p>We believe the market for ViroMasks will stay and increase as the time passes and people have a general knowledge of what is an effective face mask. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How we will use your funds </h3>
<p><u>Target 1: Raise 500K and Reduce our shipping Carbon Footprint</u></p>
<p>Currently, we are strategically producing in Dubai, UAE; practically in the center of the world and then air shipping to our customers around the world. We understand that this is not the most carbon efficient way of doing business. As step one; we would like to use the funds to rent out 3PL services across the globe in key markets and place the product there. </p>
<p><u>Target 2: Raise 1M and create local entrepreneurs and jobs</u></p>
<p>If we are able to raise one million USD or more; we will start the work on franchising the manufacturing closer to consumption market. This will ensure minimal carbon footprint; help the entrepreneurs and local industry. Help generate local jobs. And truly make it a brand that everyone owns and has an interest in. </p>
<p><u>Target 3: Raise 1.5M and create Anti-Viral Sprays </u></p>
<p>If we are able to raise more than 1.5M USD; we will spend more on R&amp;D to come up with Aerosol to make your car-seats and other fabric based touch points anti-viral. This will help in mitigating extensive cleaning needs and generally will keep the viral load in the environment to a minimal. </p>
</div></div>","ViroMasks was born out of passion to provide better and more effective solution to the raging pandemic across the globe. Facemasks in the current form were designed back in the 1930s; there is a need to disrupt the market and make more durable usable facemasks to reduce the carbon footprint, increase effectiveness and reduce the current as well as future air borne infections. 
Technology
ViroMask uses HeiQ Viroblock; a Swiss technology to neutralize viruses on the surface. Viroblock is tested in Peter Doherty Institute of Infection and Immunity in University of Melbourne, Australia and proven to neutralize 99.98% of SARS-CoV-2 virus within 30 mins. Possibly the world most efficient technology to rapidly neutralize coronavirus. The technology has two components; Silver Ions and Vesicle Structures to rapidly neutralize enveloped viruses. 

 
Design
ViroMasks uses patent-pending cup shaped design to ensure that only filtered air comes through. Sides are made of 100% ultra soft polyester to ensure no air passes through. The center pockets filter which is made of the same active layers as N95 respirator. 
Aluminum Noose Clip
ViroMasks keeps wearer’s safety and comfort paramount at each step of design. ViroMasks incorporates an aluminum flat noose clip that can easily be molded onto the wearer’s face shape. The shape is then maintained over a long period of time; ensuring proper fit onto the wearer’s face and minimal to no air leakage.
Adjustable Ear Loops
ViroMasks keeps the wearers comfort and protection as its priority. Our ear loops are made of elasticated polyester which helps give it that stretch around the ear and provides comfort over a long period of use. 
The safety provided by any mask depends on its fit on the wearer’s face. ViroMasks has incorporated a cord system to help wearer adjust the size to ensure the mask fits well providing the desired safety. 
Exhale Breathing Valves (Only in ViroMasks Vault)
ViroMasks Vault feature 2x Breathing Valves. Breathing valves are for exhale only. Their primary reason for being part of ViroMasks is: 

Help mitigate the heat buildup in the mask 
Help mitigate Carbon dioxide buildup in the mask 


 
Filtration (Vault and Armor)
ViroMasks Armor and Vault both have advanced filtration. The middle area has a pocket where the filters can be replaced. The average lifespan of a filter is 100 hours of active use. Both Armor and Vault come with 3 filters in the pack and additional filter packs can be bought. 
ViroMasks has a statically charged melt blown non-woven fabric filter. Melt blown filters above 95% particulates in the air at 0.3 Micron level. 

ViroMasks Melt blown is statically charged 
Viruses have a slightly positive charge 
The filter efficiency that ViroMasks achieve is at par with N95/FFP2/KN95 masks through our filter.

Do you know that most masks (surgical and respirators) have a plastic layer that takes over 400 year to biodegrade naturally? Who wants to see our oceans full of masks in a couple of years time ? Get your ViroMasks; enjoy the same level of protection and lower cost per usage.

In applying this technology to the finest knit material, we have expanded the potential of knit wear. We have developed two different styles, one for outdoor adventures and one for urban wear, which puts fashion at the forefront. Both styles have a variety of color options.*Please note that although RAINY DRY® has very high water-repellency, it may not completely block water against strong water pressure. 1. Long-lasting and super-strong water-repellency　　The most impressive feature of RAINY DRY® Knit Jacket is its superior water repellency. This lets the owner simultaneously look sharp and be ready for a sudden downpour at any time. It is the world’s first water-repellent jacket that can be used as rain wear made from natural fiber knit.Water-repellency test : WATER

Nós trabalhamos em parceria com a ONG Rays Aasha Ki Ek Kiran, em Jaipur, Índia, destinando fundos para a educação das crianças que eles acolhem. A Rays ajuda mais de 60 crianças soropostivas, proporcionando moradia, cuidados médicos e educação em escolas particulares às crianças. Em nosso primeiro ano, conseguimos patrocinar 1 ano de educação para 4 crianças. À medida em que crescermos, ajudaremos mais crianças. 
 


 

 

A maioria dos fundos serão usados para a produção. Incluímos também um orçamento para visitar mais artesãos, uma quantidade de desenvolver mais amostras e esforços de marketing. Se eu ultrapassar os nossos objectivos, o montante restante será usado para aumentar a produção ainda mais.


Entendemos que existem potenciais dificuldades e desafios que possam surgir ao longo do caminho, mas vamos ser completamente transparente e estará disponível com as nossas respostas e atualizações em uma base regular quando se trata de atualizações de produção e atendimento inclusive enquanto estamos com artesãos . Em caso de não alcançar o nosso objectivo, ainda vamos usar os fundos que recebemos para desenvolver produtos, ele só será em uma escala menor. Da mesma forma, se eu ultrapassar a nossa meta, vamos ser capazes de crescer ainda mais rápido.
Quaisquer atrasos possíveis serão comunicados por meio de nossas atualizações IndieGoGo e as nossas plataformas de mídia social (Facebook, Twitter e Instagram) e também através de e-mails, mas estamos certificando-se de que não vai acontecer.

<p>Prior to founding Liberti, I have been privileged to partner with not only innovative U.S. startups as a social impact marketing consultant, but also as a senior sales and marketing partner with Fortune 500 companies including United Airlines, AT&amp;T and American Express. During this 25 years, I have grown to appreciate the opportunities available to me as an American entrepreneur, due in large part to the efforts of our veterans and the hard work of our own refugee/immigrant families. I trace my own refugee heritage to the forced migration of French immigrants from Canada to New Orleans. It is with gratitude and honor to our own immigrant families that has inspired a desire in me to ""pay it forward"" to assist in refugee assimilation in America today. I am blessed to be part of a  team that is passionate and committed to supporting the &lt;1% movement,  and am especially thankful for our manufacturing partner Raul Maldonado. Raul, an immigrant from Bolivia, sought opportunity in the U.S. to develop his craft and establish a business focused on designer quality jewelry. With more than 25 years of jewelry designer experience, Raul has worked with elite brands such as Tiffany’s designer Elsa Peretti’s famous gold snake, bean pendant, wire bangle, open heart and many more. I am honored that Raul has offered to serve as the lead of Liberti’s jewelry production and Jewelry Apprenticeship Program, offering to ""pay it forward"" as well by sharing his extensive knowledge of handcrafting fine jewelry and empowering US refugees with artisan skills.<br/><br/>It is with gratitude and hope that we begin this new American story called Liberti.<br/></p>

<p><span><b>What is the &lt;1% Campaign?</b></span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p>According to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), there are 14.4 million refugees of concern around the world, and of this vast number, less than one percent are submitted for resettlement. Liberti has created our newest line, the Less Than 1% Collection, to elevate awareness for the less than one percent of refugees fortunate enough to escape the brutality of refugee camps, yet still face further hardships as they begin to settle in their new countries and rebuild their lives.</p>
<p>Even though these refugees escape, they still face further hardship as they begin to settle in their new countries and rebuild their lives. By creating opportunities to empower our resettled refugees in the U.S., Liberti and other similar organizations can reduce the number of those marginalized by society and help everyone be free to live the dream. </p>
<p><b>Is Liberti jewelry sold in stores?</b></p>

<p><b>Is Liberti a non-profit?</b></p>
<p>As a mission-inspired company, Liberti’s business model blends the best of business and social impact with a for-profit but mission-driven bottom line. Our plan is to launch an apprenticeship program to onboard refugees and integrate them into all aspects of our business, while providing on-the-job training and career building opportunities they need to be successful. Our goal is to give all employees the ability to become shareholders in the company they’re helping to create.</p>
<p><b>Where are the Indiegogo funds going?</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We’re launching on Indiegogo to kickstart our apprenticeship program, expanding the production of the &lt;1% collection and the creation of beautiful, meaningful jewelry.  All Indiegogo pledged funds will go directly to the training of Liberti Creators  and funding purchases of tools and hardware.<br/><br/>Every dollar you pledge will be an investment in the life of a resettled refugee in America through the Liberti apprenticeship training program, used to develop of skills needed to support the growing demand for domestically produced handcrafted products in the U.S. Studies show that those who complete apprenticeship programs have career earnings of $240,000 and higher than those of similar non-participants. These increased earnings will not only enhance the lives of resettled refugee families, but also directly benefit US taxpayers by reducing demand for provided services and direct resettlement costs, estimated to be $257,000 for a refugee household over 5 years.</p>
<p><b>What is our Apprenticeship Program?</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Our program is an employer-driven program that provides our refugee employees a “learn while you earn” model that combines on-the-job training with job-related mentors who provide training and instruction tied to the attainment of the skills required for the job.  Our unique model also involves progressive increases as our apprentice’s skills increase.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Liberti is leveraging the latest in technologies, 3D printing, online commerce, and innovations in training. We also use a strengths finder resource development through the complete involvement of our apprenticeship program.  All of our apprentices start working when they enter into our apprenticeship program and benefit from steady wage increases as they become more proficient. Our program will mirror the average starting wage for apprenticeship in the US, which is $15 per hour. Learn more about the areas of focus for the apprenticeship on our <a href=""http://www.libertiusa.com/pages/liberti-apprenticeship-program"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website here.</a></p>
<p><b>How are the refugees identified and how is their relationship managed by Liberti?</b></p>
<p>Liberti has partnered with several nonprofit agencies who provide support services, assimilation and needs assessments for newly arrived refugees. Our partners help us determine the refugees who would be a good fit for our company and learn more about the candidate's background. We also have a very detailed application process and we look to hire and invest in refugees who are: responsible, organized, self-starters, creative, quick learners, detail-oriented and have an interest in developing their skills to help grow the business.</p>
<p><b>How do people distinguish between refugees and undocumented immigrants?</b></p>
<p>An undocumented immigrant is someone who chooses to resettle in another country, but does not have the legal documents to seek residency and/or citizenship. Refugees do not have the choice to remain in their home country. They have fled to escape from war and persecution, often losing or leaving behind beloved family members along the way.</p>
<p><b>Where are Liberti’s refugees from?</b></p>
<p>Many of our potential refugees for our apprenticeship program will be coming from Nepal, Sudan, Iraq, Burma, Somalia or other poor or war-torn parts of the world. All potential applicants to the program must have come to the U.S. legally under the refugee asylum program. Our applicants must have a valid I-94 form and/or (aka “green card”) to apply and become a Liberti Creator.</p>
<p><b>How does money from a purchase flow back to each refugee employee and the apprenticeship program?</b></p>
<p>We reinvest profits back into the company and our apprenticeship programs. Our vision is to provide additional company-paid educational opportunities, 401K plan and profit sharing to all. We want to provide a path for success within Liberti so all can find their purpose and support within their new community and homeland and be free to live the dream.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Why the name and crown symbol?</b></p>The word Liberti is a unique spelling on the word Liberty which means to be free to live the dream. Our logo is derived from the Statue of Liberty’s crown which represents the 7 seas and 7 continents of the world and has been an icon of freedom and a welcoming signal to immigrants arriving from abroad.  “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to be free.""<br/><p></p>

Every dollar you pledge will be an investment in the life of a resettled refugee in America through the Liberti apprenticeship training program, used to develop skills needed to support the growing demand for domestically produced handcrafted products in the U.S. Studies show that those who complete apprenticeship programs have career earnings of $240,000 and higher than those of similar non-participants.

Day or night, casual or formal, this collection will allow you to exude a rare blend of confidence, charm and exquisite taste, while radiating a positive glow from knowing you brought a little more beauty to the world.







 




Our vision is to empower all US refugees to be free to live the American dream. We’re dedicated to integrating American refugees in all aspects of our business and providing on-the-job training and career building opportunities to ensure growth and professional development. Eventually, we hope to give all employees the opportunity to become shareholders in the company they're helping to build. We intend to accomplish this while continuing to create one-of-a-kind, beautiful and fashion-forward accessories with the highest quality materials, handmade in the USA.

Liberti’s Impact & Apprenticeship Program: With your support on Indiegogo, we will launch an apprenticeship program on-boarding refugee employees in all aspects of our business. This includes on-the-job training and career building opportunities that resettled refugees in the U.S. need to be successful. 






The Liberti team is modest in size but large in heart and dedication. We work hard to help our country's newcomers to be free to live the dream that we all have been blessed with. Each person in our Liberti family plays an integral part in our humble operation in Denver and Rhode Island. We appreciate all of the hard work that has made this vision a reality. 

Here is just a small sample of the Liberti crew we are proud to call them teammates, brand ambassadors, partners and fellow social impact makers. 




                                                         



Prior to founding Liberti, I have been privileged to partner with not only innovative U.S. startups as a social impact marketing consultant, but also as a senior sales and marketing partner with Fortune 500 companies including United Airlines, AT&T and American Express. During this 25 years, I have grown to appreciate the opportunities available to me as an American entrepreneur, due in large part to the efforts of our veterans and the hard work of our own refugee/immigrant families. I trace my own refugee heritage to the forced migration of French immigrants from Canada to New Orleans. It is with gratitude and honor to our own immigrant families that has inspired a desire in me to ""pay it forward"" to assist in refugee assimilation in America today. I am blessed to be part of a  team that is passionate and committed to supporting the <1% movement,  and am especially thankful for our manufacturing partner Raul Maldonado. Raul, an immigrant from Bolivia, sought opportunity in the U.S. to develop his craft and establish a business focused on designer quality jewelry. With more than 25 years of jewelry designer experience, Raul has worked with elite brands such as Tiffany’s designer Elsa Peretti’s famous gold snake, bean pendant, wire bangle, open heart and many more. I am honored that Raul has offered to serve as the lead of Liberti’s jewelry production and Jewelry Apprenticeship Program, offering to ""pay it forward"" as well by sharing his extensive knowledge of handcrafting fine jewelry and empowering US refugees with artisan skills.It is with gratitude and hope that we begin this new American story called Liberti.







What is the <1% Campaign?

According to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), there are 14.4 million refugees of concern around the world, and of this vast number, less than one percent are submitted for resettlement. Liberti has created our newest line, the Less Than 1% Collection, to elevate awareness for the less than one percent of refugees fortunate enough to escape the brutality of refugee camps, yet still face further hardships as they begin to settle in their new countries and rebuild their lives.
Even though these refugees escape, they still face further hardship as they begin to settle in their new countries and rebuild their lives. By creating opportunities to empower our resettled refugees in the U.S., Liberti and other similar organizations can reduce the number of those marginalized by society and help everyone be free to live the dream. 
Is Liberti jewelry sold in stores?
Not yet, but we hope to partner with retail stores in the near future. If you're a socially conscious retailer interested in carrying our high-end jewelry while making a social impact, please find more information on our website here.
Where is Liberti jewelry made?


Everything is made in the USA! Our manufacturing facility is located in Rhode Island and our distribution and marketing center is located in Denver, Colorado.  
What materials are used for Liberti jewelry? 


Our jewelry uses the finest stones, beads and precious metals, including nickel-free silver, brass made with copper, and pure 14 and 18 karat gold. All materials are ethically and sustainably sourced.  Learn more here.

What’s your process for making the jewelry?
From start to finish, we put a tremendous amount of creativity, care and passion into every piece we lovingly create and produce right here in America.
Liberti’s team of artists are the ones who concept, design, and develop our entire line using a proprietary blend of time-honored jewelry-making techniques and technologies, resulting in little pieces of perfection we know you’ll love.

Where do we ship?

We ship to all states in the US and around the world.

<p>As if an umbrella that predicts the weather all on its own wasn’t enough, we didn’t stop there with the TARAbrella.  Stylish, built to last and packed with features, the TARAbrella is one umbrella you won’t want to lose - and with its built-in loss prevention system, you never will!</p>
<p>Simply detach TARAbrella’s wireless pocket fob, slide it in your pocket, and you’ll be sure to never misplace or leave the TARAbrella in a café or pub while out on the town.  The TARAbrella’s pocket fob will beep to remind you of your umbrella once separated by a distance of about 30 feet.</p>

<p>A: TARAbrella’s can forecast weather by itself with both the data of a barometer and a humidity-meter to accurately estimate the weather within 6 hours. Firstly, it uses the barometer to determine the change of pressure over time (every 35 seconds). So, if the pressure drops, there is a greater chance of rain. Secondly, The humidity-meter provides information of the moisture levels in the environment, which combined with pressure levels forecasts the weather. With the sensor integrated into the handle, the LED light indicator will show you every time the weather changes.</p>
<p><b>Q3: How long does TARAbrella’s battery last after fully charge?</b></p>
<p>A: We designed the TARAbrella to be very energy efficient so that only need a very small built-in battery, which you can charge via rechargeable stand . The battery life would depends on how often you use the weather signal bar and LED light features. The battery can last for 100 hours if the weather signal bar keep turning-on; If both the weather signal bar and super LED light keep turning-on, it can last for more than 30 hours in estimate.</p>
<p><b>Q4: What is the size and weight of TARAbrella?</b></p>

When you leave your TARAbrella at one of your preset safe locations, for example, your home, office, or car, the tracker won't bother you. However, once you are 10+ meters away from your TARAbrella, the tracker will beep.</p>
<p><b><b>Q6: What does the 4 situations in 3 modes of TARAbrella mean?</b></b></p>
<p>A: The 4 situations mean sunny, partially cloudy, cloudy and rainy day. The 3 modes mean transparent mode, sparkling mode, and whole blue mode of the TARAbrella’s weather signal bar.

No more checking your phone or weather app to decide if you should bring your umbrella! TARAbrella uses 3 modes of weather indicator lights to alert you directly whether to bring it or not. It not only gives your weather forecast, but also helps you make decision, bringing simplicity and convenience to your life! Combined with its anti-lost tracker, glowing LED tip, and carbon-fiber material five times stronger than steel, yet lighter than a smartphone, you get yourself the coolest smart umbrella!






















TARAbrella Has a Mind of its Own

TARAbrella provides you with accurate weather forecast within 6 hours! Looking at the clouds and not sure if you should bring an umbrella before leaving home? TARAbrella will help alert you!



Your smartphone will tell you the weather, but it’s just one more thing you need to do with your phone. With TARAbrella, there’s no turning on phones, charging phones, or skimming through weather apps. The bright glow of the LED light bar built into TARAbrella’s handle tell you in 3 easy to identify indicators what to expect from mother nature as you head out the door; transparent for sunny or partially cloudy days safe to leave the umbrella at home; flashing blue for an overcast day with a chance of drizzle and solid blue on days when you can surely expect rain.  

  



Never Lose Your Umbrella Again



As if an umbrella that predicts the weather all on its own wasn’t enough, we didn’t stop there with the TARAbrella.  Stylish, built to last and packed with features, the TARAbrella is one umbrella you won’t want to lose - and with its built-in loss prevention system, you never will!
Simply detach TARAbrella’s wireless pocket fob, slide it in your pocket, and you’ll be sure to never misplace or leave the TARAbrella in a café or pub while out on the town.  The TARAbrella’s pocket fob will beep to remind you of your umbrella once separated by a distance of about 30 feet.










Super LED Overhead Lighting


The ultrabright LED overhead light at the crown of the TARAbrella will light your path in the dark or in fog, and provides visibility of your presence to motorists.  Stay safe and dry with the TARAbrella.








Patented Safety Runner


TARAbrella’s patented safety runner ensures easy and and comfortable opening and closing of the umbrella, guaranteed to never pinch your fingers.  The umbrella’s runner and framework are constructed of a carbon-fiber material five times stronger than steel, able to withstand even the most extreme weather conditions.  







Light As Feather


Weighing less than an iPhone (really!), the TARAbrella still
manages to be five times stronger than steel with its carbon fiber structure.











Style and Comfort


It may be high-tech in the world of umbrellas, but the TARAbrella is as stylish as it is smart and practical.  With TARAbrella, we have paid attention to detail as well as comfort.  TARAbrella’s ergonomic handle - made to fit in your hand comfortably for hours – is just one example of our attention to detail.




Wall Mount Charging Cradle



TARAbrella includes a charging cradle that can easily be mounted to the wall, meant to both charge and hold the TARAbrella while allowing the TARAbrella’s weather indicator to be easily visible as you head out the door.
















Packed inside the TARAbrella are the sensors and “brain” of TARAbrella which allow it to provide you with an accurate prediction of the day’s weather.  Inside TARAbrella, data provided by a digital barometer measures atmosphere pressure every 35 seconds while a digital hygrometer constantly measures humidity.  Add in a little electronic wizardry to analyze the combined data, and TARAbrella is able to provide an accurate, constantly updated forecast of what to expect from mother nature through the simple LED indicator bar built into TARAbrella’s handle.








 

































We've had enough frustrating experience being caught in the rain with no umbrella nearby, that's why we've decided to dedicate ourselves to designing the most outstanding umbrella. We've focused our energy in the past 12 months to develop TARAbrella. In our design process, we've overcome many challenges in order to develop the mechanism and waterproof capabilities the product currently has. Now, we are proud of be able to present TARAbrella to the world.










Our team is made up with experienced engineers, designers and creative people who have years of experience in the umbrella, product design and manufacturing industry.




Your contributions are vital in order to get TARAbrella into manufacturing. TARAbrella seeks individuals who recognize the outdated technology in the everyday umbrella, and wishes to reimagine the umbrella as an intelligent and sophisticated marvel instead of an antiquated burden. The cost of our first production run can be overcome with the help of your great support. If you are tired of the dreary rainy day, help the TARAbrella to be born.






Thank you to our amazing producer TNO Production helps us to finish all the art designs and video.



Thank you to our wonderful advisers Tronson help us finish the industry design of TARAbrella.

lining up in life. Get 3 in a row!   What We Need & What You Get We need capital to fund tooling and materials to get you the cheapest precious metal spinner to date!  For backing the project, you will receive a Tiktakto spinner in your choice of Brass, Copper, Stainless Steel, or Bronze, complete with hybrid ceramic bearing and custom anodized aluminum endcaps!    
Risks & Challenges

  We currently run the risk of not meeting our goal and being out the setup and materials for the prototype units currently being created. We need to receive enough orders to meet our funding goal and break even, creating a great spinner and delivering it to you, the customer.

<p>I'm a 24 year old fashion designer,
who finished fashion school about 1 year ago and willing to launch my own
brand, open my own business online and hopefully a physical store in Valencia,
Spain (for now).</p>
<p>I started thinking about launching
my own brand in May, 2014. That is when I started the illustrations, technical
drawings, and browsing for manufacturers. In July, 2014 I asked for some of the
samples from the collection: a couple of bags, couple of shoes, few dresses,
pants, blouses and skirts.</p>
<p>And at this point is where ‘indiegogo’
kicks in. This is the point where I need your help to get the funding I need to
make this dream come true: the factories have their minimum order quantity,
which is not very high, but without your support, I can’t meet the MOQ.</p>
<h3>What I
Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My funding goal is ambitious. Can’t
deny that! € 50.000 is a lot of money to ask for, and in such short period of
time. Let me tell you what I’m going to do with the money:  </p>

<p>Elfer has developed a network of artisans who live in remote areas across Peru. He has spent countless days over a number of years living and working with artisans in their remote, far-flung, mountain villages learning their techniques and teaching them his designs, standards, and requirements in working with yarns, textiles, pottery, woods, and metals. Together they have created clothing, jewellery, furniture, and home décor pieces, which later travelled from these villages directly to the world stage. <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/notes/elfer-castro-lab/elfer-castro/1531186373791162"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">(Read more)</a></p>

to each person, Holly made sure to have the right blend of people to be on the
team.  First and foremost on that team was one of the most talented and
successful perfumers in the United States to help her formulate what was to
become ""love at first sight"" in liquid form. </p>
<p style=""font-style: italic;"">While Holly had created simple
fragrances in the past with only two or three notes, this one required a more

<p style=""font-style: italic;"">During the course of two months and about

mantra, ""This fragrance needs to invoke and spread love!""</p>

</p><p><b>Amazing On Women!</b></p>
<p>It really is incredible how this fragrance
changes on people and even continues to change through the day.  We have
had women that literally sunk into their seats with their eyes rolling back in
complete bliss!  One woman insisted on spraying a little on her sofa,
sheets and even her dog!</p>
<p>When wearing 0.2 the possibilities are
endless.</p>
<p><b>Amazing On Men!</b></p>
<p>We can't stress enough how incredible this
fragrance smells on a man.  Dozens of men, including those that never wear
a fragrance, said that they would wear this.  </p>
<p>In comparison to other mens fragrances that
are hard to handle when you're stuck in the elevator with them, 0.2 is not
overpowering.  It contains a seductive whisper that literally draws a
person in to smell more.  Get ready to hear that question, ""You smell
amazing.  What is that cologne you're wearing?""   </p>
<p>Don't hide from your curiosity and try
the sample vial!</p>
<p><b>Married?</b></p>
<p>Here's another beautiful quality of this
fragrance.  Go back to that moment you had with your partner when you knew
they were the one or you had that rush and needed to be close to them.
 When you both wear the fragrance you can have that feeling throughout the
day when you're apart and find yourself more excited than ever to get home.</p>
<p><b>Inspired Packaging</b></p>
<p>The packaging represents through
the artwork the all encompassing rush of love. </p>
<p>An explosion of thoughts,
feelings and emotion.  Raw, undefined, but always beautiful.</p>
<p>We know that love and life can be
messy but there is always the possibility of magic.  That magic is the
embossed shiny platinum 0.2 coming through the crush of particles on the bottle
and box.  To add a three dimensional feel the particles on the bottle are
on a reverse label on the back so they shimmer through the fragrance.</p>
<p>Holly's vision was brought to
life with an incredibly talented design team in Australia that was a destined
meeting.  Brought together by a beautiful woman that just knew they had to
meet but at the time didn't even know why.  Destiny.</p>
<p>The collection will have three
different colored boxes - black, white and shiny silver.  The overall
design of our bottles and boxes are contemporary, edgy and of course sultry,</p>

<p><b>Our Mission</b></p>
<p><b>Problem:</b></p>
<p>In societies all over the world
people have stopped looking into the eyes of strangers and therefore miss out
on a connection, a possibility, and way to escape the feeling of loneliness.
 As corporations are churning out more and more technology humans have
less and less face to face interactions.  We must get back to the core of
our humanity and simple things in life like looking at each other.</p>
<p><b>Solution:</b></p>
<p>A wearable fragrance that
triggers our instinct of allure and attraction and alters our mood simply with
the intention of human connection.  The powerful combination of intention
and our sense of smell is life changing.</p>
<p><b>Opportunity:</b></p>
<p>0.2 is a fragrance that connects
an individual to their desire by powerfully provoking an emotional response
through their sense of smell: the feeling of love at first sight.</p>
<p><b>Objective:</b></p>
<p>The 0.2 fragrance will spark a
global movement of love and acceptance by reminding people to look at those
around them with wonder and possibilities.  To have a greater sense
of love for life, our fellow human beings and our surroundings.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>For Your Support</b></p>

production of filling bottles and help meet the minimums required for the
fragrances. For backing us, you’ll be the first to experience the 0.2 line with

<p><b>Risks and
challenges </b></p>
<p>Our team has experience in both
production and distribution. We've spent the last year with our manufacturer
and fragrance partners preparing for this moment. Even so, we understand our
background and experience doesn't eliminate all risks. We're still making minor
adjustments to the packaging process. </p>
<p>All has been done to avoid any
potential risks in delivering 0.2 Fragrance. Our goal is to ship before the end
of December but because the bottles are coming from France there can certainly
be a delay that is out of our control. In any case, we'll always keep our
supporters up to date.</p>

sheets and even her dog!
When wearing 0.2 the possibilities are
endless.
Amazing On Men!
We can't stress enough how incredible this
fragrance smells on a man.  Dozens of men, including those that never wear
a fragrance, said that they would wear this.  
In comparison to other mens fragrances that
are hard to handle when you're stuck in the elevator with them, 0.2 is not
overpowering.  It contains a seductive whisper that literally draws a
person in to smell more.  Get ready to hear that question, ""You smell
amazing.  What is that cologne you're wearing?""   
Don't hide from your curiosity and try
the sample vial!
Married?
Here's another beautiful quality of this
fragrance.  Go back to that moment you had with your partner when you knew
they were the one or you had that rush and needed to be close to them.
 When you both wear the fragrance you can have that feeling throughout the
day when you're apart and find yourself more excited than ever to get home.
Inspired Packaging
The packaging represents through
the artwork the all encompassing rush of love. 
An explosion of thoughts,
feelings and emotion.  Raw, undefined, but always beautiful.
We know that love and life can be
messy but there is always the possibility of magic.  That magic is the
embossed shiny platinum 0.2 coming through the crush of particles on the bottle
and box.  To add a three dimensional feel the particles on the bottle are
on a reverse label on the back so they shimmer through the fragrance.
Holly's vision was brought to
life with an incredibly talented design team in Australia that was a destined
meeting.  Brought together by a beautiful woman that just knew they had to
meet but at the time didn't even know why.  Destiny.
The collection will have three
different colored boxes - black, white and shiny silver.  The overall
design of our bottles and boxes are contemporary, edgy and of course sultry,

100ml black box, 50ml box will be white and 7.5ml box
(not shown) will be a beautiful shiny silver.
Our Inspired Words
Live in love. Love in a
heartbeat.
An instantaneous reaction. 
Transient. Human. Irresistible.
Love in an instant. Intensity.
Touched by love. Rapture. Beauty.
Love is love.
Undefined.

Our Mission
Problem:
In societies all over the world
people have stopped looking into the eyes of strangers and therefore miss out
on a connection, a possibility, and way to escape the feeling of loneliness.
 As corporations are churning out more and more technology humans have
less and less face to face interactions.  We must get back to the core of
our humanity and simple things in life like looking at each other.
Solution:
A wearable fragrance that
triggers our instinct of allure and attraction and alters our mood simply with
the intention of human connection.  The powerful combination of intention
and our sense of smell is life changing.
Opportunity:
0.2 is a fragrance that connects
an individual to their desire by powerfully provoking an emotional response
through their sense of smell: the feeling of love at first sight.
Objective:
The 0.2 fragrance will spark a
global movement of love and acceptance by reminding people to look at those
around them with wonder and possibilities.  To have a greater sense
of love for life, our fellow human beings and our surroundings.

For Your Support
Your pledge will support the
production of filling bottles and help meet the minimums required for the
fragrances. For backing us, you’ll be the first to experience the 0.2 line with
prices exclusive to Indiegogo.  The official launch in stores will be
January 2015 and Holly will be hitting the road to speak about the journey.
We can’t wait to hear what you think.

Risks and
challenges 
Our team has experience in both
production and distribution. We've spent the last year with our manufacturer
and fragrance partners preparing for this moment. Even so, we understand our
background and experience doesn't eliminate all risks. We're still making minor
adjustments to the packaging process. 
All has been done to avoid any
potential risks in delivering 0.2 Fragrance. Our goal is to ship before the end
of December but because the bottles are coming from France there can certainly
be a delay that is out of our control. In any case, we'll always keep our
supporters up to date.",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Since I can remember myself, I had a passion with travelling. After exploring most of Europe, I had a crazy idea... To go around the globe with my bicycle! The only problem back then was, that I had no bicycle... So i bought myself one and started pedaling. After completing some trips in Greece, I was ready for the ""Round the globe"" thing... But I wanted this journey to mean something, not only for me, but for everyone else as well. Having experienced all this endless gratitude, from all the people that had helped me, on all those wonderful journeys, I wanted to give some feedback to the world. So I came up with the idea to create <b><a href=""http://www.aroundthegoodworld.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Around the Good World</a></b> project.</p>
<p>This project is about all the ordinary people living next door, that are willing to help unknown strangers, without asking anything in return. Those are the real life Superheroes! It's about, breaking the walls that we have built around us, alienating ourselves from other people. The best example to demonstrate this, will be the journey itself.</p>
<p>So while i will be on the road, i will upload on the projects <a href=""http://www.aroundthegoodworld.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b>website</b></a>, all the wonderful people that will help me throughout the journey with their kind actions. You can check it out on the <a href=""http://www.aroundthegoodworld.com/category/thank-you/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://www.aroundthegoodworld.com/category/thank-you/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b>THANK YOU</b></a> page. There will be posts, photos and maybe some videos of random acts of love!</p>
<p>Help us, to share this simple but yet very powerful message, up until the most remote edge of the planet!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>On the Road</h3>
<p>The project is about to begin this May and those wheels are gonna keep spinning, for at least 3 years. </p>
<p>I will cycle an average of 50 km every day, while taking times to rest in between. When I will be on the countryside, I will mostly sleep in my tent and when in a city I will try to find couchsurfers, willing to host me.</p>
<p>I have already made two similar trips. The first was a stunning circle <a href=""http://www.aroundthegoodworld.com/around-the-good-crete/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b>around Crete</b></a>, which was almost 500 km and it took me 2 weeks to complete. The next was the round of the <a href=""http://www.aroundthegoodworld.com/around-the-good-peloponnese/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b>beautiful Peloponnese</b></a>, which kept me going for 1 month and was more than 1.000 km. You can watch photos of these incredible journeys <a href=""http://www.aroundthegoodworld.com/category/photos/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b>here</b></a>.</p>
<p>On the road, I experienced tons of kindness, hospitality and love. I made new friends and saw some spectacular views and places, that made me feel blessed! </p>

<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px;"">Fear and Love</span><br/>
</h3>
</div>People ask me often ""Aren't you afraid, going out there on your own?"" The honest answer is that, of course I'm afraid for the unknown... And this is exactly the reason, that i want to make it known!  <div>There are gonna be difficulties, that's certain. But overcoming those, is what transforms us and makes us better human beings. I'm not doing this in order to find out what to be, but instead how to be. </div><div>When you experience true love, you can't go back to fear. This is something that I've been taught, from complete strangers on my journeys. They offered me food, shelter and many more. They were not rich, they had no big houses, or cars. They were poor, but they still were sharing their meal with me, along side with their best smile. This is how Good Karma is being created! But what goes around, comes around.</div><div>So I'm choosing to accept, trust and love, everyone and everything that will come my way. The project starts pedaling <b>Around the Good World!</b>

<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;"">What Now...?</h3>
<div>The campaign has ended and i feel trully blessed for this experience! So much love and support from everybody, which is difficult to describe. The message of the project has been showed and the campaign reached the 30% of the goal, which is awessome! :D </div>
<div>Though the 70% is still missing. I am trying to reach travel agencies or airline companies, so that they can sponsor the project, by providing the travel services that are necessary for the project. Those are a flight ticket from Tokyo to San Fransisco, including the fee for the bicycle. Another flight ticket above the <b><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dari%C3%A9n_Gap"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Darien Gap</a> </b>from Panama to Colombia. Final, a flight ticket from Brazil to Morocco, so that i will be able to return to Europe. Yet, there is no company willing to help with this.</div>

                                                  (Η Φωτο είναι από τον Αlex)
</div>
<p>Από τότε που θυμάμαι τον εαυτό μου, είχα πάθος με τα ταξίδια. Αφού ταξίδεψα πολύ στην Ευρώπη, μου ήρθε μία τρελή ιδέα... Να κάνω το γύρο του κόσμου με το ποδήλατό μου! Το μόνο πρόβλημα τότε, ήταν ότι δεν είχα ποδήλατο... Οπότε αγόρασα ένα και άρχισα να κάνω πετάλι. Αφού έκανα μερικά ταξίδια μέσα στην Ελλάδα, ήμουν έτοιμος για το γύρο του κόσμου. Ήθελα όμως αυτό το ταξίδι, να σημαίνει κάτι όχι μόνο για μένα, αλλά για όλους. Έχοντας βιώσει απέραντη ευγνομωσύνη από όλους τους ανθρώπους που με βοήθησαν σε όλα αυτά τα υπέροχα ταξίδια, ήθελα κι εγώ με τη σειρά μου, να δώσω κάτι πίσω. Έτσι είχα τη ιδέα να δημιουργήσω το εγχείρημα <b><a href=""http://www.aroundthegoodworld.com/el/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Around the Good World</a></b>.</p>
<p>Το εγχείρημα θέλει να αναδείξει, όλους τους απλούς, καθημερινούς ανθρώπους, που βοηθάνε άγνωστους ανθρώπους, χωρίς να ζητάνε αντάλλαγμα. Αυτοί είναι οι πραγματικοί Σούπερ Ήρωες! Έχουμε χτίσει τείχους γύρω μας, αποξενόνωντας μας από τους άλλους ανθρώπους και το εγχείρημα, επιχειρεί να τους γκρεμίσει. Το καλύτερο παράδειμα για να γίνει αυτό, θα είναι το ίδιο το ταξίδι.</p>
<p>Για όσο καιρό θα είμαι στο δρόμο θα ανεβάζω στην <a href=""http://www.aroundthegoodworld.com/el/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b>ιστοσελίδα</b></a> του εγχειρήματος, όλους τους φανταστικούς ανθρώπους που θα με βοηθήσουν κατά τη διάρκεια του ταξιδιού, με τις ευγενικές τους πράξεις. Μπορείτε να το παρακολουθείτε στη σελίδα, <a href=""http://www.aroundthegoodworld.com/category/%CE%B5%CF%85%CF%87%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%B9%CF%83%CF%84%CF%8E/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b>ΕΥΧΑΡΙΣΤΩ</b></a>. Θα υπάρχουν άρθρα, φωτογραφίες και κάποια βίντεο, με πράξεις καλοσύνης!</p>
<p>Βοηθήστε μας να διαδώσουμε αυτό το απλό, αλλά πολύ δυνατό μήνυμα ανθρωπιάς, μέχρι τα πέρατα του πλανήτη!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Στο Δρόμο</h3>
<div>Το εγχείρημα θα ξεκινήσει αυτό το Μάιο και θα διαρκέσει, για τουλάχιστον 3 χρόνια. </div>
<div>
<p>Θα κάνω γύρω στα 50 χλμ ποδήλατο κάθε μέρα, ενώ θα ξεκουράζομαι όποτε νιώθω ότι το χρειάζομαι. Όταν θα είμαι στην εξοχή, θα κοιμάμαι κυρίως στη σκηνή μου, ενώ όταν θα είμαι σε κάποια πόλη θα προσπαθώ να βρω ανθρώπους που θέλουν να με φιλοξενήσουν, μέσα από σχετικές ιστοσελίδες. </p>
<p>Ήδη έχω κάνει 2 παρόμοια ταξίδια. Το πρώτο ήταν ένας απίστευτος κύκλος <a href=""http://www.aroundthegoodworld.com/%CE%BF-%CE%B3%CF%85%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%83-%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%83-%CE%BA%CF%81%CE%B7%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%83/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b>γύρω από την Κρήτη</b></a>, γύρω στα 500 χλμ, που κράτησε 2 εβδομάδες. Το επόμενο ήταν ο γύρος της <a href=""http://www.aroundthegoodworld.com/%CE%BF-%CE%B3%CF%85%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%82-%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%82-%CF%80%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%80%CE%BF%CE%BD%CE%BD%CE%B7%CF%83%CE%BF%CF%85/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b>πανέμορφης Πελοποννήσου</b></a>, όπου σε 1 μήνα περίπου, έκανα πάνω από 1.000 χλμ. Μπορείτε να δείτε φωτογραφίες και από τα 2 αυτά υπέροχα ταξίδια <a href=""http://www.aroundthegoodworld.com/category/%CF%86%CF%8E%CF%84%CE%BF%CE%B6/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b>εδώ</b></a>.</p>
<p>Όσο ήμουν στο δρόμο, βίωσα απέραντη ευγένεια, φιλοξενία και αγάπη. Έκανα καινούριους φίλους και είδα εκπληκτικές θέες και μέρη, τα οποιά με κάνουν να νιώθω ευλογημένος!</p>

<div><h3>Φόβος και Αγάπη</h3></div>
<div>Πολλοί με ρωτάνε συχνά ""Μα καλά, δε φοβάσαι να το κάνεις αυτό ολομόναχος?"" Η ειλικρινής απάντηση είναι, ότι φυσικά και φοβάμαι για το άγνωστο που θα συναντήσω... Αλλά αυτός ακριβώς είναι και ο λόγος που θέλω να το κάνω, για να γίνει γνωστό!</div>
<div>Θα υπάρξουν δυσκολίες σίγουρα. Το να ξεπερνάμε όμως αυτές τις δυσκολίες, είναι αυτό που μας μεταμορφώνει σε καλύτερους ανθρώπους. Δεν το κάνω αυτό για να μάθω τι να είμαι, αλλά για να μάθω πως να είμαι.</div>
<div>Όταν έχεις βιώσει την αληθινή αγάπη, δεν μπορείς να ξαναγυρίσεις πίσω στο φόβο. Αυτό είναι κάτι που μου έμαθαν τελείως άγνωστοι άνθρωποι, που συνάντησα στα ταξίδια μου. Μου προσέφεραν φαγητό, καταφύγιο και άλλα πολλά. Δεν ήταν πλούσιοι, δεν είχαν μεγάλα σπίτια, ούτε αυτοκίνητα. Ήταν φτωχοί, αλλά και πάλι μοιράζονταν το φαγητό τους μαζί μου, μαζί με το καλύτερό τους χαμόγελο. Έτσι δημιουργείται το Καλό Κάρμα! Έτσι κι αλλιώς, ότι κάνουμε επιστρέφει πίσω σε μας.</div>
<div>Έτσι επιλέγω να αποδέχομαι, να εμπιστεύομαι και να αγαπώ, οτιδήποτε &amp; οποιονδήποτε παρουσιαστεί στο δρόμο μου. Το εγχείρημα αρχίζει να κάνει πετάλι, <b>Around the Good World!</b>

<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;"">Και Τώρα Τι...?</h3>
<div>Η Καμπάνια έφτασε στο τέλος της και πραγματικά νιώθω ευλογημένος για αυτήν την εμπειρία! Τόση πολλή αγάπη και υποστήριξη από όλους, είναι πολύ δύσκολο να περιγραφεί με λόγια. Το μήνυμα του εγχειρήματος φάνηκε ξεκάθαρα και η καμπάνια έφτασε το 30% του στόχου της, το οποίο είναι φανταστικό! :D <p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p>Παρόλα αυτά, χρειαζόμαστε ακόμα το 70%. Τον τελευταίο καιρό προσπαθώ να προσεγγίσω ταξιδιωτικά γραφεία και αεροπορικές εταιρίες, για να γίνουν χορηγοί του εγχειρήματος, παρέχωντας τις ταξιδιωτικές υπηρεσίες που είναι απαραίτητες για το εγχείρημα. Αυτές είναι ένα αεροπορικό εισιτήριο από το Τόκιο για το Σαν Φρανσίσκο , συμπεριλαμβάνοντας το κόστος για τη μεταφορά του ποδηλάτου. Άλλο ένα αεροπορικό εισιτήριο πάνω από το <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dari%C3%A9n_Gap"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Darien Gap</b></a> από τον Παναμά για την Κολομβία. Τέλος, ένα αεροπορικό εισιτήριο από τη Βραζιλία για το Μαρόκο, για την επιστροφή στην Ευρώπη. Μέχρι στιγμής, καμία εταιρία δεν έχει προσφερθεί να βοηθήσει.</p>

                                                                      Hi! :-)  
                             I am Apostolis and I come from Heraklion of Crete. 


                                                                (Photo by Alex)
Since I can remember myself, I had a passion with travelling. After exploring most of Europe, I had a crazy idea... To go around the globe with my bicycle! The only problem back then was, that I had no bicycle... So i bought myself one and started pedaling. After completing some trips in Greece, I was ready for the ""Round the globe"" thing... But I wanted this journey to mean something, not only for me, but for everyone else as well. Having experienced all this endless gratitude, from all the people that had helped me, on all those wonderful journeys, I wanted to give some feedback to the world. So I came up with the idea to create Around the Good World project.
This project is about all the ordinary people living next door, that are willing to help unknown strangers, without asking anything in return. Those are the real life Superheroes! It's about, breaking the walls that we have built around us, alienating ourselves from other people. The best example to demonstrate this, will be the journey itself.
So while i will be on the road, i will upload on the projects website, all the wonderful people that will help me throughout the journey with their kind actions. You can check it out on the THANK YOU page. There will be posts, photos and maybe some videos of random acts of love!
Help us, to share this simple but yet very powerful message, up until the most remote edge of the planet!



On the Road
The project is about to begin this May and those wheels are gonna keep spinning, for at least 3 years. 
I will cycle an average of 50 km every day, while taking times to rest in between. When I will be on the countryside, I will mostly sleep in my tent and when in a city I will try to find couchsurfers, willing to host me.
I have already made two similar trips. The first was a stunning circle around Crete, which was almost 500 km and it took me 2 weeks to complete. The next was the round of the beautiful Peloponnese, which kept me going for 1 month and was more than 1.000 km. You can watch photos of these incredible journeys here.
On the road, I experienced tons of kindness, hospitality and love. I made new friends and saw some spectacular views and places, that made me feel blessed! 





  
Fear and Love

People ask me often ""Aren't you afraid, going out there on your own?"" The honest answer is that, of course I'm afraid for the unknown... And this is exactly the reason, that i want to make it known!  There are gonna be difficulties, that's certain. But overcoming those, is what transforms us and makes us better human beings. I'm not doing this in order to find out what to be, but instead how to be. When you experience true love, you can't go back to fear. This is something that I've been taught, from complete strangers on my journeys. They offered me food, shelter and many more. They were not rich, they had no big houses, or cars. They were poor, but they still were sharing their meal with me, along side with their best smile. This is how Good Karma is being created! But what goes around, comes around.So I'm choosing to accept, trust and love, everyone and everything that will come my way. The project starts pedaling Around the Good World!
 
What Now...?
The campaign has ended and i feel trully blessed for this experience! So much love and support from everybody, which is difficult to describe. The message of the project has been showed and the campaign reached the 30% of the goal, which is awessome! :D 
Though the 70% is still missing. I am trying to reach travel agencies or airline companies, so that they can sponsor the project, by providing the travel services that are necessary for the project. Those are a flight ticket from Tokyo to San Fransisco, including the fee for the bicycle. Another flight ticket above the Darien Gap from Panama to Colombia. Final, a flight ticket from Brazil to Morocco, so that i will be able to return to Europe. Yet, there is no company willing to help with this.
If you can help with this task, or you know somebody who can, please feel free to contact me at aroundthegoodworld@gmail.com and explain the details. I'm sure we can make it and we will! :)  How You Can Help There are many ways, that you can support the project :  You can make a Donation here.

Τι Είναι το Around the Good World
 
                                                                    Γειά! :-)  
                                  Είμαι ο Αποστόλης από το Ηράκλειο της Κρήτης


                                                  (Η Φωτο είναι από τον Αlex)

Από τότε που θυμάμαι τον εαυτό μου, είχα πάθος με τα ταξίδια. Αφού ταξίδεψα πολύ στην Ευρώπη, μου ήρθε μία τρελή ιδέα... Να κάνω το γύρο του κόσμου με το ποδήλατό μου! Το μόνο πρόβλημα τότε, ήταν ότι δεν είχα ποδήλατο... Οπότε αγόρασα ένα και άρχισα να κάνω πετάλι. Αφού έκανα μερικά ταξίδια μέσα στην Ελλάδα, ήμουν έτοιμος για το γύρο του κόσμου. Ήθελα όμως αυτό το ταξίδι, να σημαίνει κάτι όχι μόνο για μένα, αλλά για όλους. Έχοντας βιώσει απέραντη ευγνομωσύνη από όλους τους ανθρώπους που με βοήθησαν σε όλα αυτά τα υπέροχα ταξίδια, ήθελα κι εγώ με τη σειρά μου, να δώσω κάτι πίσω. Έτσι είχα τη ιδέα να δημιουργήσω το εγχείρημα Around the Good World.
Το εγχείρημα θέλει να αναδείξει, όλους τους απλούς, καθημερινούς ανθρώπους, που βοηθάνε άγνωστους ανθρώπους, χωρίς να ζητάνε αντάλλαγμα. Αυτοί είναι οι πραγματικοί Σούπερ Ήρωες! Έχουμε χτίσει τείχους γύρω μας, αποξενόνωντας μας από τους άλλους ανθρώπους και το εγχείρημα, επιχειρεί να τους γκρεμίσει. Το καλύτερο παράδειμα για να γίνει αυτό, θα είναι το ίδιο το ταξίδι.
Για όσο καιρό θα είμαι στο δρόμο θα ανεβάζω στην ιστοσελίδα του εγχειρήματος, όλους τους φανταστικούς ανθρώπους που θα με βοηθήσουν κατά τη διάρκεια του ταξιδιού, με τις ευγενικές τους πράξεις. Μπορείτε να το παρακολουθείτε στη σελίδα, ΕΥΧΑΡΙΣΤΩ. Θα υπάρχουν άρθρα, φωτογραφίες και κάποια βίντεο, με πράξεις καλοσύνης!
Βοηθήστε μας να διαδώσουμε αυτό το απλό, αλλά πολύ δυνατό μήνυμα ανθρωπιάς, μέχρι τα πέρατα του πλανήτη!
 
Στο Δρόμο
Το εγχείρημα θα ξεκινήσει αυτό το Μάιο και θα διαρκέσει, για τουλάχιστον 3 χρόνια. 

Θα κάνω γύρω στα 50 χλμ ποδήλατο κάθε μέρα, ενώ θα ξεκουράζομαι όποτε νιώθω ότι το χρειάζομαι. Όταν θα είμαι στην εξοχή, θα κοιμάμαι κυρίως στη σκηνή μου, ενώ όταν θα είμαι σε κάποια πόλη θα προσπαθώ να βρω ανθρώπους που θέλουν να με φιλοξενήσουν, μέσα από σχετικές ιστοσελίδες. 
Ήδη έχω κάνει 2 παρόμοια ταξίδια. Το πρώτο ήταν ένας απίστευτος κύκλος γύρω από την Κρήτη, γύρω στα 500 χλμ, που κράτησε 2 εβδομάδες. Το επόμενο ήταν ο γύρος της πανέμορφης Πελοποννήσου, όπου σε 1 μήνα περίπου, έκανα πάνω από 1.000 χλμ. Μπορείτε να δείτε φωτογραφίες και από τα 2 αυτά υπέροχα ταξίδια εδώ.
Όσο ήμουν στο δρόμο, βίωσα απέραντη ευγένεια, φιλοξενία και αγάπη. Έκανα καινούριους φίλους και είδα εκπληκτικές θέες και μέρη, τα οποιά με κάνουν να νιώθω ευλογημένος!





Φόβος και Αγάπη
Πολλοί με ρωτάνε συχνά ""Μα καλά, δε φοβάσαι να το κάνεις αυτό ολομόναχος?"" Η ειλικρινής απάντηση είναι, ότι φυσικά και φοβάμαι για το άγνωστο που θα συναντήσω... Αλλά αυτός ακριβώς είναι και ο λόγος που θέλω να το κάνω, για να γίνει γνωστό!
Θα υπάρξουν δυσκολίες σίγουρα. Το να ξεπερνάμε όμως αυτές τις δυσκολίες, είναι αυτό που μας μεταμορφώνει σε καλύτερους ανθρώπους. Δεν το κάνω αυτό για να μάθω τι να είμαι, αλλά για να μάθω πως να είμαι.
Όταν έχεις βιώσει την αληθινή αγάπη, δεν μπορείς να ξαναγυρίσεις πίσω στο φόβο. Αυτό είναι κάτι που μου έμαθαν τελείως άγνωστοι άνθρωποι, που συνάντησα στα ταξίδια μου. Μου προσέφεραν φαγητό, καταφύγιο και άλλα πολλά. Δεν ήταν πλούσιοι, δεν είχαν μεγάλα σπίτια, ούτε αυτοκίνητα. Ήταν φτωχοί, αλλά και πάλι μοιράζονταν το φαγητό τους μαζί μου, μαζί με το καλύτερό τους χαμόγελο. Έτσι δημιουργείται το Καλό Κάρμα! Έτσι κι αλλιώς, ότι κάνουμε επιστρέφει πίσω σε μας.
Έτσι επιλέγω να αποδέχομαι, να εμπιστεύομαι και να αγαπώ, οτιδήποτε & οποιονδήποτε παρουσιαστεί στο δρόμο μου. Το εγχείρημα αρχίζει να κάνει πετάλι, Around the Good World!

 



Και Τώρα Τι...?
Η Καμπάνια έφτασε στο τέλος της και πραγματικά νιώθω ευλογημένος για αυτήν την εμπειρία! Τόση πολλή αγάπη και υποστήριξη από όλους, είναι πολύ δύσκολο να περιγραφεί με λόγια. Το μήνυμα του εγχειρήματος φάνηκε ξεκάθαρα και η καμπάνια έφτασε το 30% του στόχου της, το οποίο είναι φανταστικό! :D 
Παρόλα αυτά, χρειαζόμαστε ακόμα το 70%. Τον τελευταίο καιρό προσπαθώ να προσεγγίσω ταξιδιωτικά γραφεία και αεροπορικές εταιρίες, για να γίνουν χορηγοί του εγχειρήματος, παρέχωντας τις ταξιδιωτικές υπηρεσίες που είναι απαραίτητες για το εγχείρημα. Αυτές είναι ένα αεροπορικό εισιτήριο από το Τόκιο για το Σαν Φρανσίσκο , συμπεριλαμβάνοντας το κόστος για τη μεταφορά του ποδηλάτου. Άλλο ένα αεροπορικό εισιτήριο πάνω από το Darien Gap από τον Παναμά για την Κολομβία. Τέλος, ένα αεροπορικό εισιτήριο από τη Βραζιλία για το Μαρόκο, για την επιστροφή στην Ευρώπη. Μέχρι στιγμής, καμία εταιρία δεν έχει προσφερθεί να βοηθήσει.

Αν μπορείτε να βοηθήσετε σχετικά με αυτό ή αν ξέρετε κάποιον που να μπορεί, παρακαλώ επικοινωνήστε μαζί μου στο aroundthegoodworld@gmail.com . Είμαι σίγουρος ότι θα τα καταφέρουμε! :)

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><span>My name is Imani But I go by Diamond J, or DJ for short. I am the creative custom shoe designer for clubshoeicide.com and creator of </span><a href=""http://petitgateauwhipstix.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Petit Gateau Whipstix</a><span>. I started these companies with the intent of bringing out the unique individual style of women who want to express themselves in a way that will set them apart from everyone else. My custom design shoes and lip glosses cater to the fashion and beauty industry...but are for any woman who wants to let her light shine. I am a very outgoing and creative individual, who finds herself constantly ready to take on new adventures and enjoys meeting new people.</span></p>
<p><span><span>My inspiration comes from my love of art and beauty. I look at life as a beautiful canvas, and I am constantly redefining the pictures I paint in my mind. I have always loved to be different, by expressing myself in a way society deems to be ""abnormal"". My inspiration is you, her, him and them. I believe fashion and makeup are some of the best forms of individual expression..and when I design a pair of shoes, or create my artwork on someones face, I feel free..I feel as though this is my world and I dont have to conform to the outsiders. I think outside the box, but its my box I choose to think beyond. Inspiration inspires me.</span></span></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Lip Gloss:<br/>15 lip tubes at 10 each = $150 (25 pots per package)<br/>Natural Ingredients and tools needed to make Lip Gloss in bulk= $388<br/>total needed=$538.00</p>

<p>The total amount would be $2381, however I am asking to raise 2500 for any miscellaneous items that may be needed in the process. However if I dont reach my full goal, I will still be able to fund part of my dream. To me that is a start and every success story starts from a dream and a vision, and every little penny helps.</p>
<p><br/>Funding needs to be in place by July 17th in order to take advantage of the upcoming fashion season. Purchasing of products (shoes, tools, packaging, etc) will be needed to ensure enough shoes, lip gloss and accessories are available for up and coming events to showcase for the fall and well, to start selling when people ask ""do you have anything available now?"".</p>
<p>Everyone who Donates will receive something special, be it a free lip gloss, a pair of shoes, a personal thank you card. I believe in gratitude, therefore your contribution will not go unnoticed :)</p>

<p><b><u>Eating
Disorders:</u></b><u>  </u></p>
<p>Ø<span>  </span>1.6 million people in the UK are affected by an eating
disorder; 11% of them are male. </p>
<p>Ø<span>  </span>1 in 100 women aged between 15 and 30, are affected by
<b>anorexia</b>.</p>
<p>Ø<span>  </span><b>Bulimia</b> develops around the age of 18 or 19, and is 3 times
more common than anorexia.</p>
<p>Ø<span>  </span><b>Binge
eating</b> affects males and females
equally and usually appears later in life, between the ages of 30 and 40.
 (Beat, 2014)</p>
<p>Eating
Disorders (EDs) is a mental disorder that alter seriously a person’s everyday
diet and may lead to serious health damages.  It can be manifested either by eating extremely small or
huge amounts of food. Obsession with eating and food can overtake the person’s
life.</p>
<p><b><u>Our project:</u></b><b></b></p>
<h1><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></h1>
<p>The ByPeople team has decided
to host a fashion show event in London, intended to raise people’s awareness on anorexia and
other EDs. </p>
<p>New upcoming designers will
offer their creations; the models for the show will be normal sized, everyday
girls sending an important message to all people
attending it. <b><u>Making a statement from the
‘new’ generation of designers who vote no to models with EDs</u>.</b> At the
event the attendees will also have the opportunity to interact with people form
the Beat, and be informed regarding EDs, the symptoms of eating disorders, their impact on the society and ways
to treat them. We will also provide information
and support to the kinfolks of those suffering from these diseases, with the
help of Beat, UK’s leading charity supporting anyone affected by eating
disorders.</p>

Fashion Show in Support of Beat!
Eating
Disorders:  
Ø  1.6 million people in the UK are affected by an eating
disorder; 11% of them are male. 
Ø  1 in 100 women aged between 15 and 30, are affected by
anorexia.
Ø  Bulimia develops around the age of 18 or 19, and is 3 times
more common than anorexia.
Ø  Binge
eating affects males and females
equally and usually appears later in life, between the ages of 30 and 40.
 (Beat, 2014)
Eating
Disorders (EDs) is a mental disorder that alter seriously a person’s everyday
diet and may lead to serious health damages.  It can be manifested either by eating extremely small or
huge amounts of food. Obsession with eating and food can overtake the person’s
life.
Our project:

The ByPeople team has decided
to host a fashion show event in London, intended to raise people’s awareness on anorexia and
other EDs. 
New upcoming designers will
offer their creations; the models for the show will be normal sized, everyday
girls sending an important message to all people
attending it. Making a statement from the
‘new’ generation of designers who vote no to models with EDs. At the
event the attendees will also have the opportunity to interact with people form
the Beat, and be informed regarding EDs, the symptoms of eating disorders, their impact on the society and ways
to treat them. We will also provide information
and support to the kinfolks of those suffering from these diseases, with the
help of Beat, UK’s leading charity supporting anyone affected by eating
disorders.




Seeyourself is an event/campaign calling upon everyone to see their true self in the mirror and love even
the ‘imperfections’!




Beat’s vision is that eating disorders will be beaten.
Beat’s aims
are:
• 
To change the
way everyone thinks and talks about eating disorders
• 
To improve
the way services and treatment are provided
• 
And to help
anyone believe that their eating disorder can be beaten
Beat does
this by:
• 
Challenging
the stereotypes and stigma that people with eating disorders face
• 
Campaigning
for better services and treatment
Providing information, support and encouragement to
seek treatment and recovery.


Background:



ByPeople is a PR agency,
established recently and planning to organize events that contribute in raising
funds and awareness for causes. Our belief is that change starts from small
things because, ‘there is a little bit of
the ocean in every drop’. Being active members of the society we
intend to contribute in positive change and the creation of a community of
inspired individuals.
SeeYourself Fashion Show in support of Beat aims to utilize the
influence that the fashion industry has on young individuals and generate positive change.

Budget analysis of your contribution:
79% of UK citizens in 2015 donated to a variety of
charities. (CAF, 2015) 
We ask your contribution, to raise a total of £2,000, which is the estimated minimum cost for the
realization of the Seeyourself fashion
event. 
We offer our services for free and along with our
generous sponsors will try to keep the expenditures as low as possible. The money
will be distributed as shown by the chart to organizational costs such as
installations, food and beverages, printing of material and functional costs.We are trying hard to further minimise
the cost.




Possible Concerns? 
Any surplus from the collected amount
along with the ticket earnings will be all donated to Beat. Similarly, if the amount collected fails to cover the organizational expenses the total
will be donated to the cause. 
If you choose a perk, information about the ticket
will be promptly sent to you. Further information of the event can be found on
our facebook page, and the event. http://on.fb.me/1Lg93HR
What else can YOU do? 
Apart from money you can help by letting more people
know about our event and becoming part of our community, become our
ambassadors. 
Who are we?
Six girls doing our masters in Marketing Strategy
& Innovation at Cass Business School in London; we love fashion but most of
all we believe in a better world and in small acts of good faith that generate
bigger change! 
In the picture below (from left), Maggie Petrova 
(Bulgaria), Markella Zarifi (Greece), Ysaline Lannoy (Belgium), Anna
Asprogeraka (Greece), Kiko Zhou (HongKong) and Christina Mykoniatis (Greece).




Though we have diverse backgrounds and many things
that set us apart, there are also others that bring us together and social
awareness is one of them. We would like to facilitate the link between socially
conscious individuals and good causes, which limited companies/organizations
have tried to address (Pallotta, 2013, Desmos, 2016; AH, 2016) and we hope to
inspire you.

<p><b>We believe that buying a watch should leave you looking great and with money in your pocket.</b></p>
<p>So we went about building a watch and a brand that focused on four key aspects:</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>1. Looks great; we partnered with industry leading designers to create our watches with a minimal and modern design that could be worn in any setting.
</p>
<p>2. High quality; With a 42mm stainless steel case, genuine italian leather strap, japanese movement and hardened crystal mineral glass, these watches lead the way in quality, comfort and reliability with an added 2 year warranty.
</p>
<p>3. Accessible pricing; by doing things differently and selling directly to the consumer we will be able to sell our watches for three times less than our industry equivalent. That’s more money left in your pocket. 
</p>
<p>4. Give back; 10% of profits are donated to our non-profit partners around the world helping others tell great stories. </p>
<p></p>
<p>With these principles, we have spent the past year connecting &amp; collaborating with leaders in the watch industry to produce our first collection of three styles.</p>

Our StoryInfinite Watch is a 2 best friends start up, our names are Evann and Audry. We are friends since a long time, we are very complementary and we’ve been through a lot together. We strongly believe that the customization of clothes and accessories will evolve very rapidly so as to answer to the incoming growth of the wear technology.

 asked herself - are we going forward or running in circles like the

her everyday struggle between steps and time.

 has an interesting round shape, so the first reason is decorative. 
However, like footsteps, moving clock legs are dynamic. CLOX legs are 
running in circles day after day, showing the irony of steps and time 
and its connection with every modern woman's life. CLOX is the answer 
for today's busy rhythm of life and repetitive actions that she's making
 day after day. </p>

Mia always
 asked herself - are we going forward or running in circles like the 
legs on the clock? Ever since she was little, she always lived in 
between dreams and reality, her obsession with time grew larger and 
somewhere in her imagination CLOX was created. CLOX was the answer to 
her everyday struggle between steps and time.  


Clock
 has an interesting round shape, so the first reason is decorative. 
However, like footsteps, moving clock legs are dynamic. CLOX legs are 
running in circles day after day, showing the irony of steps and time 
and its connection with every modern woman's life. CLOX is the answer 
for today's busy rhythm of life and repetitive actions that she's making
 day after day. 
Perfection takes time, so this CLOX Collection is named Take Your Time. It reminds us how important it is to sometimes slow down and do it right. The photo campaign shows the production in a fun, a bit surreal way, reminding us what every pair of shoes goes through before it ends up on our feet.

<h3>The World's Raddest Swimwear</h3>
<p><a href=""https://sensigravesbikinis.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sensi Graves Bikinis</a> combines performance, function, and fashion. We started the company in 2012 based on a need we saw in the market, and over the past 7 years we’ve continually produced swimsuits that look amazing, stay put, and empower women.</p>
<p>Now we're upping the rad factor even more with our vision of becoming the most ethical, transparent and sustainable swim line out there. That starts with transitioning to all recycled fabrics made from reclaimed fishing nets and recycled plastic bottles.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1951/7151/files/ezgif.com-video-to-gif.gif?2413"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>The Why</h3>
<p>In 2012, professional kiteboarder Sensi Graves launched her eponymous swimwear label, Sensi Graves Bikinis, to meet the demands of her sport. After losing one too many string bikinis in the surf, she decided to tackle the job herself and design suits that actually stay on in rough conditions. </p>
<p>Today, at Sensi Graves Bikinis, we design swimwear that’s made to stay put. Our core mission: <strong>to design swimwear that’s both fiercely functional and fabulously feminine. </strong>Our values include not only making great product but also protecting the places we play. </p>
<p>We aim to produce swimwear that makes you feel awesome, but we also want to make products that are truly eco-friendly. This campaign is our commitment towards increased sustainability and transparency. With your support, we can make the most eco-friendly swimwear out there.</p>

<p>We have chosen to make the entire 2020 line out of recycled fabrics! With this campaign, we are launching 5 tops and 5 bottoms available for pre-order. This campaign features a few of our best selling pieces as well as some new additions that all told, make up the most comfortable, flattering and supportive swimwear around. Get excited...

<h3>Why Back Us</h3>
<p>We have been designing and producing innovative swimwear for 7 years with sustainability built into the business from the beginning. With this campaign, our backers will put us on the pathway towards becoming one of THE most transparent, ethical, and sustainable clothing brands on the market. </p>
<p>We need YOU: people who want innovative swimwear, but without sacrificing environmental responsibility.</p>
<p>Your funding will help us:</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The How</h3>
<p>For our 2020 line, we’re partnering with Salem, Oregon facility, KAM, to implement high quality manufacturing with acute attention to detail that enables superior efficiency and fewer carbon emissions than overseas production.</p>
<div> </div>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/kP7DeEQq6Wg?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Utilizing local manufacturing is just one piece of the puzzle. Moving forward we are committed to using only fabrics made from up-cycled or recycled materials; primarily plastic bottles, reclaimed fishing nets and nylon off-cuts. These fabrics reduce the global warming impact of nylon by up to 80% compared with virgin materials.  </p>
<p><strong>For every Sensi Graves top you buy, you’re keeping 5 plastic bottles out of the ocean. </strong></p>
<p>We carry our commitment through every detail of our swimwear, by using compostable hygienic liners and packaging, recycled hang-tags and packaging and organic cotton labels.</p>
<p>Transparency in action; here's where we currently source from:</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>About the Fabrics</h3>
<p>In partnership with two fibers manufacturers, Econyl® and Repreve® we've committed to fabrics that have less impact on the world, with the ultimate goal of creating a closed-loop, take back system for old swimwear. </p>
<p>Repreve®, is one of the world’s leading performance fibers made from recycled materials. Repreve transforms recycled bottles into an amazing fiber. Compared to making virgin fiber, Repreve offsets using new petroleum and therefore conserving water and emitting less greenhouse gas in the process. </p>
<p>Econyl® starts with rescuing waste such as fishing nets, fabric scraps, and industrial plastic from oceans and landfills. This waste is then regenerated into yarns and textiles to be repurposed into apparel and more. Econyl’s vision is a circular system in which Econyl products, once at the end of their lifecycle, can re-enter the system at the beginning and be regenerated anew.  </p> <p><strong>For every 10,000 tons of Econyl® materials used, 70,000 barrels of crude oil are saved.  </strong></p> <p>Both fiber companies make excellent quality materials that hold up over time, are soft to the touch and feel amazing against the skin. </p>
<p> </p>

</div></div>","The World's Raddest Swimwear
Sensi Graves Bikinis combines performance, function, and fashion. We started the company in 2012 based on a need we saw in the market, and over the past 7 years we’ve continually produced swimsuits that look amazing, stay put, and empower women.
Now we're upping the rad factor even more with our vision of becoming the most ethical, transparent and sustainable swim line out there. That starts with transitioning to all recycled fabrics made from reclaimed fishing nets and recycled plastic bottles.

The Why
In 2012, professional kiteboarder Sensi Graves launched her eponymous swimwear label, Sensi Graves Bikinis, to meet the demands of her sport. After losing one too many string bikinis in the surf, she decided to tackle the job herself and design suits that actually stay on in rough conditions. 
Today, at Sensi Graves Bikinis, we design swimwear that’s made to stay put. Our core mission: to design swimwear that’s both fiercely functional and fabulously feminine. Our values include not only making great product but also protecting the places we play. 
We aim to produce swimwear that makes you feel awesome, but we also want to make products that are truly eco-friendly. This campaign is our commitment towards increased sustainability and transparency. With your support, we can make the most eco-friendly swimwear out there.

  

We have chosen to make the entire 2020 line out of recycled fabrics! With this campaign, we are launching 5 tops and 5 bottoms available for pre-order. This campaign features a few of our best selling pieces as well as some new additions that all told, make up the most comfortable, flattering and supportive swimwear around. Get excited... We dive into the product specifications below!

 
Why Back Us
We have been designing and producing innovative swimwear for 7 years with sustainability built into the business from the beginning. With this campaign, our backers will put us on the pathway towards becoming one of THE most transparent, ethical, and sustainable clothing brands on the market. 
We need YOU: people who want innovative swimwear, but without sacrificing environmental responsibility.
Your funding will help us:

 
The How
For our 2020 line, we’re partnering with Salem, Oregon facility, KAM, to implement high quality manufacturing with acute attention to detail that enables superior efficiency and fewer carbon emissions than overseas production.
 

 
Utilizing local manufacturing is just one piece of the puzzle. Moving forward we are committed to using only fabrics made from up-cycled or recycled materials; primarily plastic bottles, reclaimed fishing nets and nylon off-cuts. These fabrics reduce the global warming impact of nylon by up to 80% compared with virgin materials.  
For every Sensi Graves top you buy, you’re keeping 5 plastic bottles out of the ocean. 
We carry our commitment through every detail of our swimwear, by using compostable hygienic liners and packaging, recycled hang-tags and packaging and organic cotton labels.
Transparency in action; here's where we currently source from:

 

About the Fabrics
In partnership with two fibers manufacturers, Econyl® and Repreve® we've committed to fabrics that have less impact on the world, with the ultimate goal of creating a closed-loop, take back system for old swimwear. 
Repreve®, is one of the world’s leading performance fibers made from recycled materials. Repreve transforms recycled bottles into an amazing fiber. Compared to making virgin fiber, Repreve offsets using new petroleum and therefore conserving water and emitting less greenhouse gas in the process. 
Econyl® starts with rescuing waste such as fishing nets, fabric scraps, and industrial plastic from oceans and landfills. This waste is then regenerated into yarns and textiles to be repurposed into apparel and more. Econyl’s vision is a circular system in which Econyl products, once at the end of their lifecycle, can re-enter the system at the beginning and be regenerated anew.   For every 10,000 tons of Econyl® materials used, 70,000 barrels of crude oil are saved.   Both fiber companies make excellent quality materials that hold up over time, are soft to the touch and feel amazing against the skin. 
 

Includes 10 body style options to mix and match to find your perfect suit. All fabrics are UPF 50+. Each body style is available in a selection of colors. Surveys will be sent for size and color post-campaign. 
 
Alexa top
A full-coverage, high-neck and super-supportive top.  The Alexa top is specifically designed for women with larger busts and smaller rib cages. The multi-strap cross back disperses support across the entire back and enables all over cinch-ability. An adjustable back enables you to get the perfect fit.

 
Aurora bottom
This surf bottom is designed to stay put no-matter what. The drawstring waistline enables cinching for maximum staying power. And the elastic over the booty keeps everything tight and right. With a scrunch butt, the Aurora is both flattering and fun.   Colleen top
This fully reversible bikini top has hidden seams for added comfort, a one-inch under-bust elastic band for staying power and thick shoulder straps for comfort and durability. The Colleen bikini top is a comfortable sports top that has sexy strap-back detail and a low scoop neck front for crowd-pleasing wearability. Doubles as a sports bra.
 

 
Kyla bottom
The Kyla reversible bikini is our standout cheeky bottom. And because it's reversible, it’s like you get two super awesome bikini bottoms for the price of one! These bottoms are seamless and very comfortable. 
 Stacy top
Adjustable, comfortable and supportive, the Stacy top features cross back straps, pads and a ruched front. This top is designed for larger bust sizes and will hold your girls in. With good coverage and excellent support this top is made to work. Has removable soft bra cups.

Brand new for 2020, the Nika bottom is a flattering high-waisted piece that looks ah-mazing. This top features a seamless waistband for a smooth, comfortable fit and a high leg in the front for a flattering look. Moderate coverage.

But do not worry if you get your size wrong we will be happy to exchange it for you with no extra cost.Here's the link to find your ring size: http://findmyringsize.com/ Pendant CollectionAurora Borealis Patterns Pedant Set Want to feel more Special? Then, order a Custom Ring or Pendant and we are sure we won't disappoint you.  Short SummaryDismayed with the lack of uniqueness in the jewelry market, we decided to create something different. Three years ago, we bought a poor quality miniature wooden ring on the internet. We did not receive what we ordered, totally different than the pictures.We knew we could do something better and we decided to create a range of our rings. After working 2-3 years on perfectioning rings, we discovered the secret of making these ringsWe worked hard to create a ring more unique and of better quality than anything else on the market. We knew we were on to something when we put up on Facebook a batch of six rings we created by hand. We sold them all In fact, one man was so stunned by the way the ring looked in the photographs that he bought one and used it to propose to his girlfriend. The beauty of the ring knocked her socks off and, of course, she said yes.Each ring is carefully created by hand and imparted with natural materials such as flowers, wood, moss, amber, corals, etc. The result makes each ring look as if it contains its own hidden world.Development
What makes us Unique? After 2-3 years of experiment...Together, we’ve created our own ultra-clear epoxy resin formula tailored for the brand. This cures much more slowly than other epoxy blends and so seals the wood perfectly. It won’t yellow with time or when under sunlight. It’s also tougher than market resins and smooths better during sanding.we’ve also created our own coloring agents to work with this specific type of epoxy. These won’t fade after a few months and so the rings will look vibrant for years to come.Take a look at the high detailing below....  Return Policy If it needs to be resized then feel free to send it back and we'll take care of it for you. The Impact This will allow us to bulk order supplies so we can provide you these beautiful rings at a very low price and we would like everyone to feel different with the custom order option where you can send us an image or inspiration and we will create a ring just for you. So why wait? Pre-order your favorite ring now or get a custom ring. What We Need & What You Get We have been working on these rings for the last 2-3 years and we've come a long way. But now we need your help. Your support will allow us to bulk order supplies so we can make these rings available to you and others at a very low price and make you stand out from the crowd.For queries, Kindly drop us an email at chirag@myenchantedsoul.com Product Development (In Production Stage)To develop Enchanted soul, we went through a rigorous process of design, prototyping, and testing. We wanted to make sure these rings were unique and would make you feel special. We started with some rough sketches, to give us some idea of the aesthetic look of the ring. We wanted it to be smooth with no hard edges. We also wanted some initial ideas of the hidden worlds these rings could contain. Then we tested different rings, to make sure we got the shape, the feel, the epoxy blend, the quality of the wood and the overall look just right. We fine tuned our process, from turning, to selecting the right tools, manufacturing the billets, creating the hold, even the type of sandpaper we used. All this allowed us to create the finished product -- our range of beautiful handcrafted rings, with enchanted worlds you can take with you anywhere. Frequently Asked QuestionsQ: Where I can select my ring size? A : After your purchase, we will be sending out a survey. This survey is where you will specify things like ring size, ring of your selection, etc.Q: Do you make men's ring? A : Our Coral, Aurora Borealis, Wild Mountain and Gold Landscape rings are Unisex. Also, you can also place a custom order.Q: What do you mean by the custom ring? Does it mean backers can send you photos/images that they would like to have in the ring? A : Yes exactly, we will be collecting this information during the survey later.Q: What if I order a wrong size even after following the sizing guide? A: Do not worry if you get your size wrong we will be happy to exchange it for you with no extra cost.",17.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Bollytude plans to become the premium exclusive brand for all Bollywood merchandise. You might see glimpses of Bollywood in a few brands today, but it's quite an uncharted territory when it comes to having a whole brand dedicated to hindi films. Bollytude aspires to be that brand, to own that territory, to be the brand the youth associates with. The idea here is to take our favorite movies, the over abused cliches and plots, signature moves and give them a fresh new perspective, a new ATTITUDE! We aren't trying to just quote movies on a shirt, we are making a fashion statement, a bold one!</p>

We all love Bollywood movies. Some choose to love a few and some love to hate a few. Bollywood is essentially its bold colors, the heartwarming music, the cheesy romanticism, the corny plots, the ‘ouches’ and the dhishoom dhishooms, basically all things masala. We quote them everyday, from ‘Tumhare paas kya hain’ to ‘Abey khamosh’! We love these cliches and we live them! No matter how much we try denying it, Bollywood is a big part of our lives. And that’s where the idea for Bollytude came from. To make Bollywood an even bigger part of our lives.



All Bollytude t-shirts will be printed on very high quality, light weight, 100% cotton t-shirts by American Apparel / Alternative Apparel.
The goal for these t-shirts is to make something that is comfortable enough for your everyday college/office wear and fashionable enough that you'll want to wear it to a party or out on a date.
The t-shirts will be printed using direct to garment printing techniques.
Below are the links for the t-shirt sizing.

<h1>Would you like to wear a watch designed for yourself?</h1>
<p>Starter Watch is an online service that lets you design and 3D print your own watch. After designing your watch and submitting the data online, the parts will be 3D printed and delivered to you. You can simply put them together only with a screwdriver. We believe a watch can be one of the items that reflects your personality. If so, we thought, it would be wonderful if we could provide a service where anyone can easily realize her/his imaginations to create a watch for her/him.</p>

Why Sell Clothing?
After three years of attempting to generate sponsors and running the largest fundraising crossing ever attempted with Kite-surfing and Stand Up Paddling (Tonga to Australia) we have decided to take the necessary steps to become financially independent and be in the position to achieve our goals with The Ocean Ambassadors program. Here's a little story of what we were up to for 2012Other media links: http://www.leisureactivistgroup.com/content/Media-Testimonials/60.aspxWhy Go Indiegogo?
This campaign is to fulfill minimum order requirements to launch our clothing.

To complete a basic production run of our selection we need this project goal to be met. Without full minimum orders we cannot take our line to the masses.

Our perks are produced only from certified and traceable waste material. As we feel when selling an ""Eco Product,"" you better know what you're talking about.

If we reach our goal. Our products can start to be recognized as a leader in quality as a caused based brand where proceeds go straight into our flagships operation of The Ocean Ambassadors. (http://theoceanambassadors.com/)

</center></div>","Hi! We are Mark and Twan,
In 2010 we started the World's First Crowdfunded Fashion brand: YOUASME MEASYOU. We want to realise a closer connection between our designs and you, to be inclusive rather than exclusive.
This is expressed through the designs of our refined knitwear and jersey labels MEASYOU (men) and YOUASME (women). 
Our aim is to slow down the speed at which we consume, choosing more aware for better quality and long lasting design.
In order to raise funds for the production of our 7th. collection for Fall/Winter 2014-2015 we now return to the community.
We made a Fantastic list of Perks for you to choose from, hopefully you'll be able to support us!
We would really appreciate it!
Thank you!!
Mark & Twan

</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3> <p>Our goal is simple. We have the opportunity to visit New York City at the tail end (har har!) of August, and we will be purchasing a variety of limited-run materials that cannot be found anywhere else. The garment district is known for its selection of high quality, one-of-a-kind fabrics that are produced in smaller quantities. We are planning to spend two days in the city, the first to shop around and see what's available, and the second day to finalize our purchases and bring our treasures home. </p>

<li>Our goal is simple: $500 will get us about 20 yards of fabric if we average the cost at $25 per yard. Some of the fabrics may be more or less, and we may be able to haggle down prices depending on how much we are willing to spend. <br/>
</li> <li>In return for supporting our campaign, you will receive products made from the materials we bring home. You'll be the first to own some of these beautiful faux fur accessories, all handcrafted by Foxie. </li>
<li>All rewards will be delivered in time for Halloween 2014. Also, all reward tiers include the cost of shipping within the United States. <br/>

<li>Add unique, limited run accessories to our repertoire, <br/>
</li> <li>Increase our stock for conventions and on Etsy, which is incredibly busy during the months of September and October, and <br/>

</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The biggest challenge in all of this will be deciding how much material to bring home. We already plan to purchase several yards of hard-to-find fabrics, whether we receive funding through this campaign or not. However, any contributions will allow us to expand that amount and decide on a larger variety instead of limiting ourselves to just a few types of faux furs. <br/></p> <ul>
<li>For each $250 we receive in funding through this campaign, we will select an additional color and/or texture of faux fur to purchase. This will increase the variety of products available for Halloween this year. <br/>
</li> <li>Since we won't know until we get there what options we will have available, we cannot guarantee choices of colors up front. We will be sharing images of the fabrics we decide upon on our Facebook page, and if none of them suit your preferences for the reward you've selected, you are welcome to choose something more closely aligned to what you are expecting based on the other materials we have access to year-round. (For example, if you had your heart set on a royal fabric, but we can't find it on our trip, we will pursue other options for making sure you get what you're looking for.) <br/>
</li>
<li>If the success of this campaign is far greater than we are expecting, we have experienced friends that can be enlisted in some of the tasks, such as tracing patterns onto fabric or flipping products right-side-out in order to save time and get everything shipped out before Halloween.</li>

<p>In addition, if you're familiar with the New York City garment district, we welcome any tips you may have regarding which shops to visit, what sights to see (Foxie hasn't been to the City since she was just a kid!), and even where to have lunch. </p>
<p>This is going to be so much fun! </p>

We will be sharing images of the fabrics we decide upon on our Facebook page, and if none of them suit your preferences for the reward you've selected, you are welcome to choose something more closely aligned to what you are expecting based on the other materials we have access to year-round. (For example, if you had your heart set on a royal fabric, but we can't find it on our trip, we will pursue other options for making sure you get what you're looking for.) 

If the success of this campaign is far greater than we are expecting, we have experienced friends that can be enlisted in some of the tasks, such as tracing patterns onto fabric or flipping products right-side-out in order to save time and get everything shipped out before Halloween.





  Other Ways You Can Help Want to see some of the fun things we'll come up with, but unable to contribute financially? Please spread the word! Share this campaign on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and any other social media platforms you're on. 
In addition, if you're familiar with the New York City garment district, we welcome any tips you may have regarding which shops to visit, what sights to see (Foxie hasn't been to the City since she was just a kid!), and even where to have lunch. 
This is going to be so much fun!",8.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p>Two friends had one vision, to build the most transparent watch company in the world. After a cricket match in Menorca, we sat down and realised that we had more in common than just this sport. We were unaware of the other's enthusiasm for watches and the desire to design timepieces. What started as a conversation, led to a plan to start our own brand. We developed a strategy to deliver direct to the consumer. This was the start of the #HWjourney.</p>
<p>All the watches you see here on this Kickstarter campaign have a retail price of $145 each, but they are available as a reward to you for a <strong>pledge of just $90.</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541638076/eewoegibtkhifizchum5.png"" src=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To design stylish minimalist watches with an industrial twist</strong></li>
<li><strong>To ensure affordability without compromising on quality</strong></li>
<li><strong>To become the most transparent watch company in the world</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It goes without saying that we wanted to design quality stylish watches without the big brand mark up, like you, we are watch enthusiasts unhappy with paying over inflated prices.</p>
<p>Quality is paramount to us; we believe our reputation is only as good as the durability and reliability of our watches. Therefore we ensured that all materials used in the making of our watch were of the highest standard. Every watch is individually tested before being shipped to our customers.</p>
<p>We wanted to do things slightly differently; so we set out to become the most transparent watch company in the world. We're building a unique on-line community through our Ambassador Club. This means we are the only company giving our customers and fans the opportunity to see what we do behind the scenes to cut our way in this industry. We are documenting everything we do on social media, via Facebook, Instagram, SnapChat and YouTube. We have once a week live Facebook broadcasts, we make films of us hand delivering watches to competition winners, we give daily story updates and make videos featuring our Ambassadors. In a short period of time we have grown the club to over 2,500 ambassadors in over 50 countries across the globe. They all have the opportunity to give us feedback on our products, marketing and branding.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541638186/jhjzmvjbfukx4t6ymhru.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our #HWjourney has only just begun and we want it to become a global phenomenon. We want to put into manufacture even more lines of watches after these chronos and further develop our growing Ambassador Club. With a successful Kickstarter campaign we will be able to further develop our marketing strategy to grow our Ambassador club to over 50,000 people across the globe. We will ensure that our transparency remains throughout our #HWjourney and we are excited to see where it may lead in the future.</p>

<p>All our watches have interchangeable straps and the Chronograph sub-dials are a 24 hour clock, 60 minute timer and 60 second timer.</p>
<p>Hagley West Watches are also backed with a warranty. We are so confident with the quality and durability of our watches, that if something were to happen within the first 2 years, we hope you will send it back to us. Warranty includes all internal parts of the watch. </p>
<p> Warranty does not cover: </p>
<ul>
<li>The life of the battery </li>
<li>Wear and tear and aging</li>
<li>Any damage on any part of the watch resulting from abnormal/abusive use, lack of care, negligence or accidents</li>

</div></div>","Two friends had one vision, to build the most transparent watch company in the world. After a cricket match in Menorca, we sat down and realised that we had more in common than just this sport. We were unaware of the other's enthusiasm for watches and the desire to design timepieces. What started as a conversation, led to a plan to start our own brand. We developed a strategy to deliver direct to the consumer. This was the start of the #HWjourney.
All the watches you see here on this Kickstarter campaign have a retail price of $145 each, but they are available as a reward to you for a pledge of just $90.


To design stylish minimalist watches with an industrial twist
To ensure affordability without compromising on quality
To become the most transparent watch company in the world

It goes without saying that we wanted to design quality stylish watches without the big brand mark up, like you, we are watch enthusiasts unhappy with paying over inflated prices.
Quality is paramount to us; we believe our reputation is only as good as the durability and reliability of our watches. Therefore we ensured that all materials used in the making of our watch were of the highest standard. Every watch is individually tested before being shipped to our customers.
We wanted to do things slightly differently; so we set out to become the most transparent watch company in the world. We're building a unique on-line community through our Ambassador Club. This means we are the only company giving our customers and fans the opportunity to see what we do behind the scenes to cut our way in this industry. We are documenting everything we do on social media, via Facebook, Instagram, SnapChat and YouTube. We have once a week live Facebook broadcasts, we make films of us hand delivering watches to competition winners, we give daily story updates and make videos featuring our Ambassadors. In a short period of time we have grown the club to over 2,500 ambassadors in over 50 countries across the globe. They all have the opportunity to give us feedback on our products, marketing and branding.

Our #HWjourney has only just begun and we want it to become a global phenomenon. We want to put into manufacture even more lines of watches after these chronos and further develop our growing Ambassador Club. With a successful Kickstarter campaign we will be able to further develop our marketing strategy to grow our Ambassador club to over 50,000 people across the globe. We will ensure that our transparency remains throughout our #HWjourney and we are excited to see where it may lead in the future.


All our watches have interchangeable straps and the Chronograph sub-dials are a 24 hour clock, 60 minute timer and 60 second timer.
Hagley West Watches are also backed with a warranty. We are so confident with the quality and durability of our watches, that if something were to happen within the first 2 years, we hope you will send it back to us. Warranty includes all internal parts of the watch. 
 Warranty does not cover: 

The life of the battery 
Wear and tear and aging
Any damage on any part of the watch resulting from abnormal/abusive use, lack of care, negligence or accidents

In order to turn this dream of ours into a reality, we need your support in the form of pledges, but also for you to share our story with a friend. 
We are doing everything we can to spread the word of the #HWjourney on social media but if you could simply share our page on your social media platforms it will help us enormously.

What's more, with the bag attached to your front, you can keep your gear safe in front of you, where you can see it.So what makes it so special?The Wolffepack Capture has a unique set of features that make it perfect combination for cameras and access:- Custom-designed removable padded camera podThe specially-designed padded camera pod docks and locks in the top of the backpack, for perfect access to your camera. It can be stowed in the bottom half for a different space configuration, or it can be removed completely.The capacity of the pod includes space for a DSLR (with lens) plus 2 spare lenses (like a 24-70mm) or 1 lens plus a flash unit. It also has side mesh pockets that can take filters or lens pens or spare batteries. The zipper pocket has space for cables or filters or spare memory cards, and it also has a dedicated card storage flap. - Aperture action easy openingWe worked hard on the ergonomics and workflow for the camera user. The aperture action means that when unzipped in a clean, easy, one-handed single movement, the top of the bag naturally drops open to reveal your gear in the perfect place in front of you, exactly to hand, exactly where you need it. - Hands-free operation, bag off the groundWith the bag moved to the front you can rest it on your front or stow it there with the G-hooks and webbing straps. This gives you a ready made workstation right in front of you, leaving you free to work with both hands, without having to take the bag off and put it on the floor. - Customisable carry systemA special 2 part access bag, it has an internal dividing shelf that can be unzipped and folded flat. This creates 3 carry modes and converts from 2 compartments to one large cargo bay to suit your gear and your day.- Direct access to lower section of bagThe split-level design of the Capture means that you have instant access to the bottom of the bag, meaning no rummaging through other items to get to the bottom of your stuff for what you need.  - Wolffepack patented expetoSYSTEMWolffepack combines the access advantages of a messenger bag with the comfort and health benefits of a backpack. The innovation at the heart of the Capture's unique appeal is Wolffepack's patented orbital trapeze technology: the expetoSYSTEM. But that's not all...The Wolffepack Capture is full of features - we've sweated to cover every last detail.Padded, microfibre-lined 15""laptop sleeve, accessible with pod loaded: The custom-designed camera Pod is padded and lined with microfibre to protect valuable equipment. There are configurable dividers, a zippered pocket, mesh pockets and elasticated slip for SD cards:A Wolffepack branded waterproof rain cover in ripstop nylon stashes into a hidden pocket underneath the base of the bag, ready for whenever you need it.An adjustable chest strap is also removable, if you don't need the extra load stability the strap provides.Inside the back panel (you can see it behind the chest strap) sits a sculpted airflow back system, well padded to keep you comfortable and coolThe shoulder straps are wide and padded with EVA foam to spread the load and give you the best backpack experience.We've added thoughtful touches to make your bag look clean and neat, like strap tidies. At the end of the webbing length that adjusts the size of the shoulder strap we put a little extra flap and stud so you can fold it over and tidy it away to get rid of those dragging loose ends that get in the way and get filthy.Tripod clips are included, as is a comfortable neoprene-lined top handle that integrates into the aesthetic profile of the backpack. The front of the bag includes a quick access slip pocket, held in place by one of our customised G-hooks. It also has webbing loops on its front section for a bike light.The lower section, ready to take your everyday gear has 4 internal cargo net pockets, ideal for chargers or spare batteries.The main bag section has a high rated no.10 big zipper, to ensure smooth action and reliable service.Spaces for all your gear:The main compartment carries the pod and gives access to the laptop/tablet sleeve. The front access compartment has an organiser section at the top, and beneath it sits the lower cargo bay for everyday gear.Specifications:Capacity: 26 litres approxBag weight empty: 1.5kg approxBag Dimensions: height 46cms, width 31cms, depth 18cms Exterior Textiles: high grade water-resistant 450x300D melange polyester with PUx2 coating, gunmetal zipper pulls and hooksCamera Pod (removable): height 18cms, width 25cms, depth 14cms, weight 0.2kg approx.

With a heritage drawn from the worlds of mountaineering, sailing and the military, we have used a combination of materials and invention that has revolutionised backpack design.The bag is held totally stable on the back by 3 super-strong cords at different points, so that it cannot swing or move until the moment you choose to release it.It is strong and easy to useCan a backpack be securely held by cord? We've designed for strength and stability:
3 cords (not just one) anchored at separate points on the bag keep it totally stable and securely held to your back when raised, without any swinging
the cords can pull a load of over 300kg, more than enough for a typical backpack
Dyneema cords are tough and it's a material used by the military for ballistic protection
It's a simple and easy operation to use the Wolffepack® backpack. Here is that video demonstration, once again: The original development processWolffepack started out 15 years ago as just an idea, born out of watching a postman struggle to get repeated access to the letters in a sack on his back. Personal frustrations with the backpack over the years led to the belief that there had to be a better way to carry stuff, but still get quick and easy access to it.It moved from being just an idea, to initial sketches:Eventually, with the help of the Kickstarter community in November 2014, an idea about how to reinvent the backpack came to life and the Wolffepack backpack was born, and now has thousands of users in over 30 countries and design awards across 3 continents.About the creatorDavid Wolffe has an Engineering degree from Cambridge University, and is a lifelong backpack user and photography enthusiast, whether travelling, commuting, skiing, or corralling his 3 kids.Project timetableWe have already worked closely with our manufacturing partners to build thousands of Wolffepack Metros and Escapes (our first styles). We've also created with them a number of prototypes leading to finished Capture samples that we love. Once Kickstarter quantities are clear, we can begin the production process. We expect that the first bags should be ready to ship to your doors in November this year. The following timetable is planned:- July/August 2016: Kickstarter Campaign- August 2016: Confirm order with factory- August 2016: Order materials and components- September 2016: Production commences- October 2016: Finished units start journey to warehouse- November 2016: Final last-leg dispatch to Kickstarter backers Risks and challengesWe've already run and delivered a successful Kickstarter so we know a little about how to deliver a project.We've built thousands of Wolffepacks so the technology is already working on a volume scale basis.The risks to delivery of the project are limited in nature due to the huge amount of development and planning that has already taken place. Working prototypes have been in testing for several months and have passed threshold tests. The design is now ready for production and all specifications have been signed off. Samples of the Wolffepack Capture have been manufactured but in units only. The transition now is into scale production.",46.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>My name Is Steve Thompson, founder of Necessary Good, LLC. I've been hard at work and I want to share with you the reasons why I chose to start Necessary Good.</p>
<p>First, I love expressing my personality through socks. Whether it's the bold colors, creative designs or simply their stylish appearance,  I have always had a passion for crazy socks. People were always curious about what crazy socks I might wear, so about a year ago I got an idea. I enjoy style and fashion as a form of self-expression and I was already investing lots of money into buying socks made by other people. It just seemed necessary to create a good product of my own. </p>

<p>I have lots of ideas put together -- some can be seen now within the gallery and I will continue to post more as I finish them.

My goal is to have 100 items posted in the Amplified Light Etsy shop within the first six months of owning the laser.</p>
<p>I will be starting a new Etsy shop, separate from my current. Amplified Light will also get its own Storenvy shop. Further, I plan to upgrade my current shop on Big Cartel so that I can sell 25 Amplified Light items there.

<p>I own <a href=""http://www.AmplifiedLight.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">AmplifiedLight.com</a> and will sell all of my items there as well.</p>

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>
<div>With a laser cutter, I can create basically anything that I can design in a vector file. Even further, not only can I cut up to 1/4"" acrylic and wood, I will also be able to engrave those materials as well. This creates the opportunity to personalize any item, and can be used to add details to items.</div>
<p></p>
<div>I consider myself a very eclectic individual -- I love a lot of different things and I can relate to people on lots of different levels. That's one aspect I look forward to the most with this business -- being able to connect with people on a much more personal level.</div>
<p></p>
<div>I feel like this was made for me. It's everything I could want from a creative process. I'm so in love with typography, graphic design, bright, bold colors, and I can go on for days with all the different ways I can combine all of these things and create these visions with this equipment. </div>
<p></p>
<div>Often in my feedback, customers will talk about how many compliments they tend to receive while wearing a piece I designed. That's such a cool feeling for me -- not only am I being complimented but my customer is too.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Contributing to this campaign will really be helping make a dream come true. I feel very prepared to take this business on and soon make you proud to be a part of it.</div>

</div> <p></p>
<div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p></p>
<div>My biggest challenge with this endeavor is why I'm here! The initial start up cost of this business is really the only thing keeping me from beginning.</div>
<div>One possible challenge I have considered involves the shipping of my product. Depending on the design, pieces I intend to sell could have delicate parts that will need to be shipped properly to avoid breaking in transit.</div>

<div>The solution: as I intend to sell items such as necklaces and bracelets, I can hang those items from necklace fold-overs, similar to how they would be presented at a costume jewelry store. I will place that in a black and white striped tissue paper, and that in a clear plastic pillow box for added protection.</div>
<p></p>
<div>I feel the chance for risks with this endeavor is very low as I've been successfully running a business via Etsy for the past two years. Within that time I've experienced a lot of different challenges and I have all of that experience going into this business.</div>

Together we designed collectives that brought on trend style with compelling prints, featuring a diverse, modern and trans-seasonal
fashion range that caters for women of all ages, all over the world –
supporting our online phenomenon. 


Always aiming to surprise and delight each collective
supports a trending theme drawing inspiration from a blend of counter cultural
events that have played a part in human evolvement. From flower power,
environmental movement, sexual and spiritual revolution to the birth of the
London club scene!
Liberated Heart designs are the essence of psychedelic
fashion and are the go-to for not only the Australian festival season but are
also in high demand intentionally.





Our team puts so much energy and importance into the life
style and vibe behind our brand. Having the ability to reach out to all
generations, sharing our culture and values is one of the most amazing parts of
building something truly special - which sets us aside from the norm. 
W H A T  WE  N E E D  &  W H A T  Y O U  G E T
Over the past year, with lots of positive manifestations and
opportunities, we have managed to grow rapidly and exponentially.  We met the challenges of new production while increasing our supply as quickly as possible to support our ever
growing customer and fan base. 


CHALLENGE - Fast growth has meant we sell out quickly and loyal customers await our next replenishment. 
GOAL - Increase our production capacity!
 We also want to be able to offer better shipping
opportunities for our international customers.  
CHALLENGE - We want Liberated Heart to be available for as many people as possible.  Investing your favorite pieces should not have to include high shipping. 
GOAL - Starting in our fastest growing market, we aim to be shipping from LA as soon as possible, allowing FREE SHIPPING across the US!!
Our goal is to raise 50k to boost us 
forward and make it happen. 







Not only do we have some super sweet and unique perks for you, featuring a limited edition 'crowd funding' print and potentially a 2 night stay at print artist Colin Heaney's 'Casa Blu' in beautiful Byron Bay but you also will be able to choose a charity to donate to. 






         T H E  I M P A C T

This would allow us to move on to the next level as we are always drawing constant energy and inspiration that allows for continual growth and modernisation. Our team is constantly creatively expressing new garment ideas and mind blowing prints to keep customers and fans excited. We are exponential, oozing potential and pushing the boundaries of fashion and style with out of this world unique tendency.
Here at Liberated Heart, we honestly feel like this is an amazing opportunity to connect with you, to invite you to join us on this J O U R N E Y and be a part of an already established business that is ready to move forward and please our customer & fan base. With such steady growth and on a constant rise we feel that this is an amazing time to pay it forward and get things going - bring on the new year because we are R E A D Y & E X C I T E D

Further to our campaign to grow Liberated Heart we also want to support the causes most important to our hearts.  To share in our abundance and joy with our 3 chosen charities we created a mycause.com.au campaign.  If you go to https://www.mycause.com.au/page/85306/liberatedheartpayingitforward

<h2>CHOOSE YOUR TIPE...</h2>
<p>TIPE Watches believes that you should be able to own a high quality, durable watch that doesn't break the bank and goes everywhere with you. For this first collection, we focused on:  </p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>design</strong> and getting every detail accurate. We wanted a watch that you could dress up or dress down. Something with a sharp, sophisticated look.</li>
<li>The <strong>quality</strong>, meaning the craftsmanship of the watch as well as the materials used to make it.</li>
<li>The <strong>cost</strong>. We don't want you to just own one TIPE Watch. Our price point was very important, so that you can own multiple watches for your different styles. </li>

<h2>WHO IS TIPE WATCHES?</h2>
<p>TIPE Watches (pronounced type) was formed over a year ago in Phoenix, Arizona by a team of  photographers, marketers, and graphic designers that shared a similar love of watches. We collaborated to design a watch that would be affordable as well as durable.</p>
<p>TIPE Watches is committed to producing the perfect watch that can go everywhere with you. We hope you can see our love of watches through the current and future designs and our attention to detail. Our goal is to provide multiple collections with different styles for men and women, continuing to focus on quality and affordability.</p>

<h2>OUR PROMISE TO YOU</h2>
<p>As we stated earlier, cost was one of the major focal points while developing these watches. We don't want you to just own one TIPE Watch. Our price point was very important, so that you can own multiple watches for your different styles. </p>
<p>We looked around at the competition and noticed that they charge an inflated price due to extremely high markup. We work directly with our manufacturer, so we are able to pass savings along to you in the form of a high quality watch that is affordable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517815403/b67lcne9qxtltbku9ysq.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>TIPE WATCHES ARE BACKED BY A WARRANTY</h3>
<p>We truly believe in our watch quality and you should as well. The 24-month warranty covers all internal parts of the watch (movement, hands, and dial).</p>
<h3> </h3>

When you receive your watch, we hope that you share with us, through social media, where you go with your TIPE watches. </p>

TIPE Watches will be featured in British GQ in the May, June, and July issues!! Find us in the Fashion Collection section. Get your TIPE today!!

 
 
CHOOSE YOUR TIPE...
TIPE Watches believes that you should be able to own a high quality, durable watch that doesn't break the bank and goes everywhere with you. For this first collection, we focused on:  

The design and getting every detail accurate. We wanted a watch that you could dress up or dress down. Something with a sharp, sophisticated look.
The quality, meaning the craftsmanship of the watch as well as the materials used to make it.
The cost. We don't want you to just own one TIPE Watch. Our price point was very important, so that you can own multiple watches for your different styles. 




 
INTRODUCING TIPE WATCHES
Our first prototype was produced in early 2017. Since then we have refined all aspects of the watch and have confidently landed on these final designs for our Original Collection. 









 

WHO IS TIPE WATCHES?
TIPE Watches (pronounced type) was formed over a year ago in Phoenix, Arizona by a team of  photographers, marketers, and graphic designers that shared a similar love of watches. We collaborated to design a watch that would be affordable as well as durable.
TIPE Watches is committed to producing the perfect watch that can go everywhere with you. We hope you can see our love of watches through the current and future designs and our attention to detail. Our goal is to provide multiple collections with different styles for men and women, continuing to focus on quality and affordability.


 
WATCH SPECIFICATIONS:

For the Case and Clasp material, we used Double IP plating on the stainless steel to prevent tarnishing. Watches that include double IP plating are:

Prague / Monaco / Santiago: Black double IP plating
Moscow / Madrid: Rose Gold double IP plating


 

 

OUR PROMISE TO YOU
As we stated earlier, cost was one of the major focal points while developing these watches. We don't want you to just own one TIPE Watch. Our price point was very important, so that you can own multiple watches for your different styles. 
We looked around at the competition and noticed that they charge an inflated price due to extremely high markup. We work directly with our manufacturer, so we are able to pass savings along to you in the form of a high quality watch that is affordable.
 

 
TIPE WATCHES ARE BACKED BY A WARRANTY
We truly believe in our watch quality and you should as well. The 24-month warranty covers all internal parts of the watch (movement, hands, and dial).
 

 
WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT
With your pledge, we will be able to fund this first collection of TIPE Watches. Your support goes beyond just purchasing a watch. We want to create a community with our backers - a bond. We want you to feel a part of this company as well. We will provide you with updates along the way. When you receive your watch, we hope that you share with us, through social media, where you go with your TIPE watches. 
If you would like to make a contribution instead of purchasing a watch and support our journey, please click on the pink ""BACK IT"" button at the top of the page. We truly appreciate your support!
We ask that you share your interest in TIPE Watches with your friends and get them involved as well. If you could spread the word about our campaign, that can help us as well. 'Like' our Facebook page, follow us on Instagram or Twitter, and help us make TIPE Watches a reality! Please sign up on our website to receive updates and special offerings once our campaign is over.

Dak Anthony underwear will be a sexy, comfortable, fun line, while still focusing on great support letting you rock it out on stage without worrying about too much movement.Personally, this has been a dream of mine for a long time and is a project I have been passionate about to help me regain myself spiritually while having fun and helping to build some security for my family.
What We NeedAll funds raised will help create Dak Anthony the brand. Not only having the underwear made but also the business portion: finding models to be the face of the company,  hiring a photographer, creating and maintaining a website, advertisements, and booking underwear shows/ parties are all part of getting this business (and myself) up on it's feet.  

The Impact Dak Anthony underwear will be fashionable, made with great quality, and sold at very afforadable prices.I love to hear feed back from everyone...positive and negative. .I feel this will only make my product better for the company as well as the consumer.I want to make men of all types comfortable in my underwear, but most of all comfortable in their own skin. The Dak Anthony brand will have an assortment of underwear that will help do just that.

Other Ways You Can HelpI know some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help:
Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about Dak Anthony underwear line. Please help by sharing this Indiegogo page. Every bit of buzz and every single dollar helps me get the brand some exposure!THANK YOU!!!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<div><b><h1>FAQ</h1></b></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>1. Can I order each band a different size and color?</b></div>
<div>Yes, you can choose any mix of sizes and colors with your order.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>2. When do I tell you my order details such as sizes and colors?</b></div>
<div>Contribute towards the perk you want today, and after the campaign ends, we'll contact you by email to gather all of your order details in the form of a simple survey. We will also help you with sizing or any other questions you might have.<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>3. How big is the pocket inside the band?</b></div>
<div>The pocket dimensions are approximately 2 ¼ inches long (5.72cm) x .92 inch wide (23.4mm) x .11 inch thick (3mm). That translates to roughly 2 keys or 2 folded bills or a combination of the two. The pocket can stretch to accommodate a shape outside of these dimensions. For example, Pocketbands securely hold the Fitbit One which is 9mm thick.<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>4. Can I put my car key in the pocket?</b></div>
<div>There are some car keys that will fit into the pocket, but many of the newer cars with large keys or key fobs (computer chip remotes) are too large to fit in the pocket. However, many of the major car companies like Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Mercedes etc. have created “valet keys” or ""smart keys"" that can be removed from the key fob that will fit inside the pocket. Just search eBay or online (ex: ""toyota smart key"" or ""honda valet key"") to see if your model of car is available. Then just make sure the dimensions of your key are similar to the pocket dimensions listed above.<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>5. How long does the glow in the dark Pocketband glow for?</b></div>
<div>Glow in the Dark Pocketbands ""charge"" when exposed to a light source and will glow up to 1-2 hours per charge. Looks Neon Green during daylight and glows green at night.<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>6. What color bands are compatible with the LED lights?</b></div>
<div>Please note this Red LED insert light is compatible with the Clear, Red, Pink, Orange, and Glow In The Dark Pocketbands. For ages 14+.<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>7. Are Pocketbands water-proof?</b></div>
<div>Pocketbands are made from a sweat/water-proof material. However, to keep the pocket contents water-proof, you can place small items inside 1"" x 2"" baggies. We do not recommend you submerge expensive electronics or valuables under water.<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>8. How does the new size Pocketband compare to the original?</b></div>
<div>
<p>The new Pocketbands 2.0 design is about 30% less bulky. The part of the band opposite of the pocket has been reduced 1.2mm. The entire pocket height has been reduced 4mm and the walls have been reduced down .5mm. Even though these dimensions have been reduced, the bands are now more flexible and will still hold the same objects as the original. </p>
<p><br/></p>

FAQ

1. Can I order each band a different size and color?
Yes, you can choose any mix of sizes and colors with your order.

2. When do I tell you my order details such as sizes and colors?
Contribute towards the perk you want today, and after the campaign ends, we'll contact you by email to gather all of your order details in the form of a simple survey. We will also help you with sizing or any other questions you might have.


3. How big is the pocket inside the band?
The pocket dimensions are approximately 2 ¼ inches long (5.72cm) x .92 inch wide (23.4mm) x .11 inch thick (3mm). That translates to roughly 2 keys or 2 folded bills or a combination of the two. The pocket can stretch to accommodate a shape outside of these dimensions. For example, Pocketbands securely hold the Fitbit One which is 9mm thick.


4. Can I put my car key in the pocket?
There are some car keys that will fit into the pocket, but many of the newer cars with large keys or key fobs (computer chip remotes) are too large to fit in the pocket. However, many of the major car companies like Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Mercedes etc. have created “valet keys” or ""smart keys"" that can be removed from the key fob that will fit inside the pocket. Just search eBay or online (ex: ""toyota smart key"" or ""honda valet key"") to see if your model of car is available. Then just make sure the dimensions of your key are similar to the pocket dimensions listed above.


5. How long does the glow in the dark Pocketband glow for?
Glow in the Dark Pocketbands ""charge"" when exposed to a light source and will glow up to 1-2 hours per charge. Looks Neon Green during daylight and glows green at night.


6. What color bands are compatible with the LED lights?
Please note this Red LED insert light is compatible with the Clear, Red, Pink, Orange, and Glow In The Dark Pocketbands. For ages 14+.


7. Are Pocketbands water-proof?
Pocketbands are made from a sweat/water-proof material. However, to keep the pocket contents water-proof, you can place small items inside 1"" x 2"" baggies. We do not recommend you submerge expensive electronics or valuables under water.


8. How does the new size Pocketband compare to the original?

The new Pocketbands 2.0 design is about 30% less bulky. The part of the band opposite of the pocket has been reduced 1.2mm. The entire pocket height has been reduced 4mm and the walls have been reduced down .5mm. Even though these dimensions have been reduced, the bands are now more flexible and will still hold the same objects as the original.

<p>The campaign is a limited collection of Popbeachshorts. The shorts are made from recycled plastic bottles, they have a 4-way stretch, are hydrophobic, quick drying and light weight. They have been designed with our passion for water sports in mind, and we wanted to reflect that through their feature detailing. They come with inner draw strings and no outer seams on our board shorts for comfort and our signature waxed African print cotton pockets and candy striped piping for style. Did we mention they come in 12 colours also ?  Meaning there’s something for everyone.</p>

<p>Our Popbeachshorts stem from our passion for the environment we live in and the people who inhabit it.  Our focus lies especially on the children, who without an education find themselves helpless,  and the marine life who are facing extinction at an alarming speed as a direct result of our negligence. We are a movement, highlighting eco-fashion and conscious living by fighting against plastic proliferation and improving literacy in poor hard to reach areas.</p>

<p>From this campaign we would have helped rid the world of over 60,000 waste plastic bottles, a drop in the ocean. With your help we could be able to increase this number by a factor of 10 to 600,000 in 2018 and would have also raised approximately $4000 for our education initiative.</p>

<p>Hi everyone! So this is actually my second Crowdfunding, and this time it's for my very own Dragon designs &lt;3 I've always been totally in love with asian dragon designs, and so I fused things I loved about the different types of dragons depicted in mythology and came up with this fellow &lt;3 Haku's design from Spirited Away for sure inspired the foxy features ;) </p>
<p>I usually do fan-art based work, so this is the first time I'm really doing my OWN thing, so I'm super excited and nervous to get this started. Hopefully you like these guys as much as I do! The reason I’m running this indiegogo is to pre-order these items with the express purpose of covering manfacturing costs and shipping products for a 500 unit order! The rest of the funds go to shipping (mailing), customs fees, etc. If we BLAST past our goals, I’ll add more designs and merchandise! This isn’t to make big money, it’s to get these guys made!</p>
<p><strong>The goal of this is 2500, </strong>but I’m happy to make that a soft goal to make sure if we miss the mark, these still get made &lt;3</p>
<p>Now, to explain the tiers. I want all these babies available off the bat, but that puts a SCARY high amount as a goal if I want to cover the shipping, manufacturing, fees etc. However, I don't like the idea of putting ""pay walls"" and potentially stopping someone from getting a design they love. So I'm going to risk it for the biscuit, and put a WAY lower goal than I likely should, and hope for the best. Worst case, I take a little financial punch in the gut, but I'm putting my faith into these guys as my first ever original pins... SO, without further ado: </p>

<p><strong>Now for the technical bit, where's the money going? How long is this going to take after the Kickstarter ends? How do I choose my dragon if this succeeds?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Money</strong>:</p>
<p>All the collected pledges are going right into production and shipping these lovelies out. I will eventually be listing them on my Etsy and other store fronts, but they're going to be available here for an insanely discounted price (they're very complex and the plating is expensive and difficult to do right!) IF this goes further than I'm estimating conservatively, I'll just keep adding goodies for backers :) This isn't about turning a profit (full disclosure, it becomes that after I start officially selling them C;) </p>
<p><b>How long will it take to get the rewards?</b></p>
<p>Good question! These are really complex and have a lot going on, so I do not want to rush my manufacturer in any way, and risk compromising quality. Here's a breakdown for the foreseeable timeline: </p>
<p>Production: From start to finish, these are more than likely a month to 6 weeks production time. When I do complex work, I go out of my way to go to a good manufacturer, meaning higher costs, lengthier process but most importantly, a beautiful finished product. I will be keeping backers up to date every step of the way, and should any delay come up I am always super transparent and upfront about it! The manufacturer already has all the proofs, so they're ready to go when I'm ready to go, so no delays there :) </p>

</div></div>","Hi everyone! So this is actually my second Crowdfunding, and this time it's for my very own Dragon designs <3 I've always been totally in love with asian dragon designs, and so I fused things I loved about the different types of dragons depicted in mythology and came up with this fellow <3 Haku's design from Spirited Away for sure inspired the foxy features ;) 
I usually do fan-art based work, so this is the first time I'm really doing my OWN thing, so I'm super excited and nervous to get this started. Hopefully you like these guys as much as I do! The reason I’m running this indiegogo is to pre-order these items with the express purpose of covering manfacturing costs and shipping products for a 500 unit order! The rest of the funds go to shipping (mailing), customs fees, etc. If we BLAST past our goals, I’ll add more designs and merchandise! This isn’t to make big money, it’s to get these guys made!
The goal of this is 2500, but I’m happy to make that a soft goal to make sure if we miss the mark, these still get made <3
Now, to explain the tiers. I want all these babies available off the bat, but that puts a SCARY high amount as a goal if I want to cover the shipping, manufacturing, fees etc. However, I don't like the idea of putting ""pay walls"" and potentially stopping someone from getting a design they love. So I'm going to risk it for the biscuit, and put a WAY lower goal than I likely should, and hope for the best. Worst case, I take a little financial punch in the gut, but I'm putting my faith into these guys as my first ever original pins... SO, without further ado: 

 
Here’s an up close of our dragon friends!

Now for the technical bit, where's the money going? How long is this going to take after the Kickstarter ends? How do I choose my dragon if this succeeds?
Money:
All the collected pledges are going right into production and shipping these lovelies out. I will eventually be listing them on my Etsy and other store fronts, but they're going to be available here for an insanely discounted price (they're very complex and the plating is expensive and difficult to do right!) IF this goes further than I'm estimating conservatively, I'll just keep adding goodies for backers :) This isn't about turning a profit (full disclosure, it becomes that after I start officially selling them C;) 
How long will it take to get the rewards?
Good question! These are really complex and have a lot going on, so I do not want to rush my manufacturer in any way, and risk compromising quality. Here's a breakdown for the foreseeable timeline: 
Production: From start to finish, these are more than likely a month to 6 weeks production time. When I do complex work, I go out of my way to go to a good manufacturer, meaning higher costs, lengthier process but most importantly, a beautiful finished product. I will be keeping backers up to date every step of the way, and should any delay come up I am always super transparent and upfront about it! The manufacturer already has all the proofs, so they're ready to go when I'm ready to go, so no delays there :) 
Shipping: I ship merch ASAP. I panic when I see loads of stuff to be shipped, even from my small shop, so luckily for you all, I get stuff out FAST. That being said, I'm Canadian, and shipping from here can be a NIGHTMARE. I circumvent said nightmare however, by sending pins via post to stop clients from paying 20$ to ship a pin...

How do I choose my dragon?
At the end, I will send surveys to every backer asking what rewards they want! Fret not :) More rewards will become available as the Indiegogo progresses",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We want to dedicate this campaign to the crafters of the Victorian gilded age. Their design and attention to detail was outstanding, especially considering their limited resources. </p>
<p>We also want to mention <strong>Mr. Max Kline</strong> and <strong>Dr. James Naismith</strong>. Along with the sneakers found at the estate sale we also purchased many of Max's momentos including the photo below. We believe the sneakers were passed down to him in Denver by Dr. Naismith whom was attending medical school there. Dr. James Naismith is forever remembered as the Father of basketball, one of the greatest sports of all time. </p>

2. Produced high end vulcanized footwear that was sold around the world.
3. Created the 1st basketball sneaker as a prototype. It is believed to have been shown at the Chicago's World Fair in 1892.

The World's Oldest Basketball Sneaker

125 Year Old Sneaker!

Hundreds of hours of research; combing through old newspaper scans; visiting the town of Colchester and snapping up memorabilia as it popped up on Ebay has led us to the conclusion that this sneaker holds the claim of ""World's First Basketball Sneaker."" Converse agreed and retracted their claim of being the World's First. 

The technology to purify rubber did not exist until around 1905. The sneakers contain impure, pocked rubber, allowing us to easily date them. 

The Colchester National Treasure is the Grandfather of all sneaker brands, it's DNA is encoded in MILLIONS of pairs worn since.

Dedication
We want to dedicate this campaign to the crafters of the Victorian gilded age. Their design and attention to detail was outstanding, especially considering their limited resources. 
We also want to mention Mr. Max Kline and Dr. James Naismith. Along with the sneakers found at the estate sale we also purchased many of Max's momentos including the photo below. We believe the sneakers were passed down to him in Denver by Dr. Naismith whom was attending medical school there. Dr. James Naismith is forever remembered as the Father of basketball, one of the greatest sports of all time.

The complication is fairly straightforward, as each of the 12 hours is evenly divisible by one, two, three or four, so each arm can show the same number of hours.

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>We are aware our project is bold and complex: ""making watches that have never been made before"". It is true that there are always unforeseen issues, but we have anticipated and planned for potential risks and have built a rock-solid production and delivery plan.</p>
<p>Firstly, we've been in the manufacturing and distribution business for years and so our knowledge and expertise of the production process is quite advanced. You can have complete confidence in our capacity to provide high-quality products on time. Our thousands of satisfied customers from the ERA Prometheus campaign is evidence of this.</p>
<p>Most products that fail on Crowdfunding fail because the sponsors were just hobby tinkerers who had no idea how different prototypes are from mass producing finished items. We don't have that problem. This is what we do day in and day out. There will be no surprises. Our years in the industry have let us build out a sophisticated distribution network so delivery will be timely and inexpensive.</p>
<p>In any case, if there is <strong>ANYTHING</strong> unexpected that happens, we promise to keep you informed right away, both during the campaign and afterwards.</p>
<p>Lastly, know that over the past few months we have shown our prototypes to many watch connoisseurs, journalists and influencers. We have gathered an incredible amount of valuable feedback and are finally ready to make millionaire watches a reality for everyone.</p>
</div></div>","ERA Timepieces - ERA Prometheus - ERA Tourbillon - ERA WatchThe ERA Prometheus Tourbillon Watch raised $1.3 million USD on Kickstarter and Indiegogo. Our ERA watch makes it possible for you to buy tourbillon watches and more haute complications. The ERA tourbillon watch, using every bit of luxury found in traditional luxury watch brands, has forever altered the industry.Watch the video above to see how we made Certified Millionaire Tourbillon Watches and made them attainable for all.Thanks For All Your Support!

---------------The ERA Poseidon And ERA Hyperion -- Two Timepieces Unlike ANYTHING The World Has Ever SeenIn 2018, We Made History On Indiegogo As The Most Successful Mechanical Watch On-Demand Project EVERHowever it was only the beginning....Because today, we are taking on the most famous watch in the world -- The Diver. It is the most recognized timepiece in the world today. It is king of the popularity contest.Chances are when you hear the word ""wristwatch"", most people picture something similar to a Rolex Submariner in their heads, whether they know why or not.Everyone knows it.Everyone copies it.This design has become so popular that it’s now a design for - the Masses.But when you have always lived like no one else, always stood apart from the herd…You deserve a timepiece that is as unique - as YOU are.A watch not for the Masses, but for Millionaires: the Wandering Hour diver. The New York Times says the wandering hour is an extraordinary first 
 
And it's made for the most powerful people of the world; it's an exclusive design for bold wearers 

 But good luck finding this engineering marvel. According to Hodinkee (the most visited watch site in the world), despite the wandering hour’s age and history, it is a rarity in modern watchmaking. See, put a wandering hour into ANY watch -- the price explodes:Five figures, Six figures, INSTANTLY.Put a wandering hour into a Dive watch however, the price explodes and - it becomes, the ONLY *dive watch* of its kind… Introducing - a certified millionaire diver, unlike any other:
 ******************************************ONLY 1000 ERA POSEIDON TIMEPIECES WILL EVER BE MADE******************************************Modeled after the Mega yachts on the French Riviera, the Poseidon’s rare wandering hour is an instant conversation starter. The hand-crafted bow, stern, port, and starboard, all inside a timepiece, is a watchmaking First.
 This feat is displayed on Bold - and Gradient dial colors: complementing the single and Dual-Toned bezels.How To Tell Time With The Wandering HourThe Hour is displayed on the sub-dial on the hand.  At the top of each hour, the number will change.  The 1 hand on the timepiece is a minute hand, read like a normal minute hand on a normal watch. 
So you read the hour in the sub-dial, then the minute on the minute hand.  It takes about 2 weeks to acclimate to reading time in this way, but then it's as easy to glance at the time as it is any other timepiece.
Poseidon Styles
 
 
 Protecting this rare mechanism is a Domed sapphire crystal and an Exotic 316L case - multi-faceted like a Diamond. 
 Armed with a helium release valve, the Poseidon is also equipped to withstand depths of up to 1000 Meters. So your timepiece IS as Adventurous as it is Unique. In fact, each watch is engraved with a unique identifier, making your timepiece a Limited Edition and Officially, one-of-a-kind.Lastly, the Poseidon’s heritage: Your timepiece is made by SWISS artisans and powered by our IN-HOUSE, SWISS MADE movement - the ERA-001 calibre - the absolute First of its Kind.
  No clone. No copy. The Poseidon is truly a SWISS diver unlike any. Other.
 
 
 

 
 
  ******************************************ONLY 1000 ERA HYPERION TIMEPIECES WILL EVER BE MADE******************************************But what if you wanted more?Wanted something impossible: like the rarity of a wandering hour AND...the luxury of a tourbillon.No watch has EVER had the BEST of BOTH these worlds.So facing impossibility, we turned to the one place with infinite possibility -- the Cosmos.And here among the stars, we found inspiration to create the world’s first: wandering hour Tourbillon -- The ERA Hyperion
More rare than a typical six figure tourbillon, the ERA Hyperion comes with a head turning 3 o'clock mechanism. Seen in Only 1 out of 500 tourbillon watches, the distinction is unmistakable.Combine that with a wandering hour, power it with a futuristic rocket, and this is an instant masterpiece. 
And the star powering it all?Our custom-made, in-house movement, the ERA-002 calibre -- another absolute first of its kindAnd like all six figure tourbillons, no two ERA Hyperions will be the same.Black Aventurine glass lines every dial. Each is handmade with flecks of cobalt, silica, and manganese: forming one-of-a-kind flares on every watch face. This galactic symphony is viewed from the designed porthole of a futuristic Spaceship.Rivets and ridges seal the sapphire crystal window shut.  While the airlock wheel at 12 o’clock is actually a crown that powers it all. With the ERA Hyperion, each glance at your wrist will open up a new dimension of Space Time. 

It is the sum of ALL infinite possibilities in the Universe, and a reminder that NOTHING is impossible to get.

 

But wait -- what exactly qualifies us to be able to create timepieces that have literally never existed before we created them?In case you aren't familiar with our Company and our Brand, let's take a look at who we are and how we got to our position today:We launched our company in 2018 with the launch of our critically-acclaimed ERA Prometheus -- The World's First Attainable Tourbillon TimepieceThe response was incredible. You supported us in record-breaking numbers here in the USA....and record-breaking numbers WORLDWIDE.  Nothing shows a brand's success than the appreciation in value of its timepieces. When we first launched, the ERA Prometheus started at $899. Now ERA Prometheus have SOLD (not just listed) for $1100 to $1800. That means that ERA Timepieces have increased in value 33% to 100% in just one year.  No wonder the greatest SWISS watchmaker in the world, Philippe Dufour, predicted our success. Video starts at 19:22 and the following are Dufour's EXACT WORDS: ""It's a way to fight. But people sometimes people don't realize they say 'we [Swiss] are the best'. But things are moving all around us...when you see what they are coming with their tourbillon...its working properly, its accurate, its affordable. Who knows in five ten years they have a big big watch shop where people are filling and beveling by hand...$3000 or $100,000 you choose."" Not surprisingly, we've found that people simply can't stop talking about us online.
 
 
 
 
 
 Even mainstream media (NBC, CBS) took notice:



 

Celebrities? They loved wearing their ERA Timepieces as well. 

 
Like fmr Unified Bantamweight (WBA, IBF) World Champion boxer Ryan Burnett
And legendary NBA future Hall Of Famer, greatest dunker of all time, Vince Carter 
Leading Youtubers in the watch space loved their ERA Prometheus:

And most important of all - YOU loved us. You sent us 100s of personal messages. Whether it was to rave about your ERA Prometheus, or the white glove customer service you experienced, or the excitement you felt about joining the ERA family -- we THANK YOU.





      Your messages hang over our office, like flickering stars guiding us through uncertain nights. They inspire us.Because we came together not to buy another watch, but to create a new ERA --  an era where no one dictates our place in life -- an era where we follow our own path -- an ERA where NOTHING is impossible for us to get.
 
 
 
It's important to remember that by owning one-of-a-kind tourbillons and wandering hours, your timepieces are bound to attract A LOT of attention. But wearing an ERA is NOT about flaunting a 6 figure timepiece. Your watches are unlike ANYTHING else,Because YOU are Unlike ANYONE else. When the world told you to “get a regular job”, “play it safe” ,  “Listen to what other people think of you” - you refused. You needed to live life on your own terms. So you built your business, you took your trip, you started that relationship, you quit your dead end job - you. followed. your. bliss. And that’s why you DESERVE a timepiece that IS as Unique as You Are. Because a Cloned copy of what everyone Else is wearing, does NOT belong in YOUR STORY.If you agree with that...then please, support our timepieces. Reserve an ERA Timepiece at a Founders price and help us continue to make even More 6 figure watches - Attainable for all. Thank you!We pride ourselves in being the most accessible high-end tourbillon timepieces in the market. So for a full 24 months (2 Years):If your watch is suffering from ANY mechanical defect, we will gladly service it for free during this time and make it right.And for servicing -- unlike other brands who price gouge you well into the four figures, as an Indiegogo backer you are all covered for a flat fee of $150.This rate will cover servicing and 100% insured express delivery back from our servicing centers. We expect delivery for this Indiegogo campaign to begin in December 2019 for the ERA Poseidon, and January 2020 for the ERA Hyperion.And we aim to make our shipping fees as affordable as possible. While you are responsible for all import taxes globally, we have methods to assist you with this matter as well.  Please shoot us an email at support@eratimepieces.com for more info.We can confirm that customers in the USA, Singapore, and Hong Kong will NOT have to pay any import taxes.PoseidonDiameter:  44mm           Thickness:  18.9mmAccuracy:  +/-12seconds/dayPower Reserve: 42hoursFrequency:  28,800vphJewels: 25Case: Custom Hand Finished 316L Stainless Steel Crystal: Ultra Scratch-resistant, Domed Sapphire GlassWater Resistance: 100ATMMovement: SWISS-MADE In House ERA-001 CalibreStrap: Custom Made Stainless SteelWeight: 250g HyperionDiameter:  44mm           Thickness:  18mmPower Reserve: 45hoursFrequency:  28,800vphJewels: 35Case: Custom Hand Finished 316L Stainless Steel Crystal: Ultra Scratch-resistant, Domed Sapphire GlassWater Resistance: 5ATMMovement: In-House ERA-002 Hybrid Wandering Hour + Tourbillon MovementStrap: Custom Made Stainless SteelWeight: 220g Michael GalarzaAny Silicon Valley venture capitalist will tell you that a start-up is only as good as its founding team, and so it makes sense for me to introduce myself to you.I started ERA because I personally yearned to wear watches that were impossible for regular people to wear.

Most products that fail on Crowdfunding fail because the sponsors were just hobby tinkerers who had no idea how different prototypes are from mass producing finished items. We don't have that problem. This is what we do day in and day out. There will be no surprises. Our years in the industry have let us build out a sophisticated distribution network so delivery will be timely and inexpensive.
In any case, if there is ANYTHING unexpected that happens, we promise to keep you informed right away, both during the campaign and afterwards.
Lastly, know that over the past few months we have shown our prototypes to many watch connoisseurs, journalists and influencers. We have gathered an incredible amount of valuable feedback and are finally ready to make millionaire watches a reality for everyone.",114.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>When you're shopping, traveling, or hiking, often it's on a cold or rainy day. But once the sun comes out, or you go inside the mall or airport, either you tolerate uncomfortable heat, or your jacket ends up bunched in your hand or slung over your arm. Wouldn't it be nice to be comfortable, AND have both hands free?</p>
<p><strong><em>You can be Hands-Free with the C3!</em></strong> </p>
<p>My name is Lisa Caramanis. The Comfort Coat Caddy (C3) is a new accessory of my own patented design that will make walking or traveling with a coat much easier. Simply attach your coat or jacket's collar tag to the C3's easy-to-fasten snap loop. Then, when you wear the C3 on your shoulders, you can slip your coat on and off as often as you want, without burdening your hands or arms. Your coat remains with you, but you don't have to trouble yourself at all! It's a functional, convenient, and comfortable accessory. Once you try the C3, soon you won't know how you ever got around without it!</p>
<p><strong><em>The Impact</em></strong></p>
<p>I have always loved helping others and making people feel good. I believe the C3 will be both convenient and helpful for a wide range of people. It's easy to use, causes no damage to garments, and can even help promote independence and responsibility in children. Here are some examples of how the Comfort Coat Caddy will be a handy accessory:</p>
<p>• Your children will never lose their jacket again, or ask ""Mommy, will you carry my coat?""</p>
<p>• Joggers and hikers can prepare for any weather, and still enjoy complete freedom of movement.</p>
<p>• You'll always be ready for changing temperatures at charity walks or outdoor festivals.</p>
<p>• People suffering from injuries or limited range-of-motion will find the C3 makes life easier.</p>
<p>I currently am the sole proprietor of a business called Highly Recommended, an architectural enhancement firm which for 35 years has been enhancing the finest homes in New England. Now I want to use the experience and determination that made my business a success to bring the C3 to the masses.</p>
<p><strong><em>What We Need and What You Get</em></strong></p>
<p>$5000 will get me well on my way. By contributing to the C3, you'll not only be helping me achieve my dream of making the world a little more comfortable, you'll also be supporting worthwhile charities, because a part of the profit from each Comfort Coat Caddy sale will be donated to the March of Dimes or Camp Sunshine. Those who contribute larger amounts will get their own C3, with different options available according to the size of the contribution. Even if we do not reach our entire goal we will follow through and deliver all the Comfort Coat Caddies that are ordered. Thank you and God Bless You.</p>

<p> Mindy Hardy has been in the nail industry for over 20 years.

Since Mindy's greatest passion in the<br/>nail industry is nail art, she has worked with her company to develop a nail<br/>art brush line for nail technicians and a polish collection for both nail<br/>technicians and clientele.

blends high style with high social impact. It’s not an
ordinary fashion start-up or traditional nonprofit - it’s a social
enterprise, which means REVIVAL Style will implement profitable business
strategy, but it will be driven first and foremost by a social mission. 
How did the
idea for REVIVAL Style develop? We
noticed the increasing loss of quality in the clothing we buy and the amount of
underemployed talent both overseas and here in North America. At the same time,
we noticed that consumers today are becoming more conscious and want to
purchase products they know and trust are “good” for them, “good” for the
earth, and “good” for the people who made them. The problem however, is that
when it comes to apparel, there are not a lot of stylish, ethically-sourced
options. But, REVIVAL Style is going to change that by proving that looking
good and doing good don’t have to be mutually exclusive!
What exactly
is REVIVAL Style? REVIVAL
Style is a premium apparel line designed to appeal to the globetrotting fashionista
looking to add unique pieces to her wardrobe. The line will include beautifully
embellished apparel and accessories that balance stylish modern silhouettes
with the ornate beauty of traditional Indian craftsmanship.
Why is there
a need for REVIVAL Style? Female
Indian artisans are not earning enough to support themselves or their children
because of the disconnect between traditional Indian craft and the needs of a
modern-day consumer. As a social enterprise, REVIVAL Style, will preserve
Indian craft and highlight the talent of these women. REVIVAL Style will help
artisans make fair wages doing something they love by fusing Indian craft skill
with contemporary design, enabling them to use their strength to find a
sustainable income source and uplift themselves and their families out of
poverty. In addition, REVIVAL Style will reinvest in the artisans' communities
through education programs.
The majority of
the garment construction will take place in the US, and so, REVIVAL Style will
also create a positive social impact here by helping to revive the Garment District in New York City!
Where can you
buy REVIVAL Style apparel and accessories? REVIVAL Style will leverage a distribution channel that
incorporates the best of various e-commerce strategies, as well as intimate
shopping parties and will potentially be featured in local NY boutiques.
Marketing efforts will focus primarily on sharing uplifting & inspiring
stories through an integrated social media campaign.
Who benefits
from REVIVAL Style?  REVIVAL Style has three main stakeholder
groups and will create a positive social impact for each group by economically
reviving Indian artisans, as well as the American garment sector,
and ultimately, our customers, who will feel good because of the stylish
and ethical purchases they’ve made. 
Through
REVIVAL Style, we’re changing the conversation from economic development to
economic empowerment by focusing our story on the talent of female
artisans. 
What’s Next: Allie and Neetu are headed to India to
begin production of the debut capsule collection! Become a part of the movement,
YOU can help REVIVAL Style create a global (and local) social impact - PLEDGE TODAY!

The temples are then sanded, coated or stained and polished all by hand. No two pairs of <strong>tmbr.</strong> sunglasses are exactly alike.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Acetate Frames</strong> : The frames of the sunglasses are made from high-quality acetate. It isn't the same cheap plastic that you get when you buy a pair of sunglasses from a truck stop. It is the same product that is used to make the high-end designer frames. The frames are formed through an injection molding process and then sanded, coated and polished all by hand.

With previous manufacturing experience, We thought we should be able to manufacture something that is of the highest quality while also preserving the legacy of a loved one.   Why Your Help is So Important The most expensive part of manufacturing our Cross & Crucifix is having the molds manufactured. It takes several molds to make the various sizes of the mens and womens cross and crucifix. 
To break it down in general terms, the process involves:- Engineering of the product (which we already have completed via CAD design and 3d printing prototypes.)- Manufacturing of the molds by the tool shop. We need a mold for each design and size that we offer.- Then off to manufacturing by Metal Injection Molding (MIM).
- Metal Injection Molding which is a relatively new manufacturing process that produces exceptionally high quality and very durable product.

If you would like to learn more about (MIM) you can follow the below link. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_injection_m...
- Packaging design is very important to us as well. We needed to design packaging that was worthy of such a high quality product as our Cross and Crucifix. Plus we wanted something durable for the men and women deployed, so that it arrives in perfect condition. Were going to leave it as a surprise but we think you will love the packaging so much you won't be throwing it away.

        
ENOUGH OF US, NOW FOR YOU:- We will have available the Cross and Crucifix in three sizes for men and three smaller sizes for women. You will have the option to have your Cross engraved with up to 11 characters across and up to 22 characters down. We will also have an option to have your loved ones birthstone inlaid into the center of the Cross if you prefer.

  Why Your So Important to the Future of Valor Jewelry... Your contribution is so important to us! Whether it's a locket of their loved ones hair, soil from their homeland or even ashes of a loved one, We KNOW so many service members and their family members would appreciate this Cross and Crucifix. 
    Our Challenges One challenge we face is the design of the Crucifix. Trying to generate a mesh 3d CAD design for the tool shop that they can use for the manufacturing of the mold. We want the detail to be perfect. The biggest challenge we face is the costs of the molds. We looked into other manufacturing processes that may have been more cost effective but wouldn't produce the high quality we wanted to achieve.

Yet new generation keyholders only focused on functionality, but overlooked aesthetics. Designers came up with a truckload of metallic components that no fashionable man or stylish woman would even think of touching and there were no other options.Well, the game is over.Now you can have a minimalistic, stylish fashion accessory to carry your keys: 10 different designs to choose from, for all kinds of fashion styles.Pick your style and feed your soul! “Whoever said that money can’t buy happiness, simply didn’t know where to go shopping.”- Bo Derek   Many months passed by until we finally had the industrial design for the ultimate keyholder in ten different styles. We are proud to present you with a truly ingenious product at such an affordable price.#getitbeforeitbecomesmainstream “Fashion is not necessarily about labels. It’s not about brands. It’s about something else that comes from within you.” - Ralph Lauren Medical grade hook and loop fasteners are used in Key2Wallet™.For each Key2Wallet, you will receive one set of hook buttons (ten pieces) for your keys. You may also attach them to your own USB stick or money clip, which you can carry along on your Key2Wallet.*Are the hook and loop fasteners strong and durable enough?Yes! We have selected ""built to last"" materials. As shown in our promotional videos the hook and loop system is more strong and durable than needed. We say this, because we have been using the final prototypes for the past 3 months ourselves and we have not experienced any problems regarding this issue at all. Key2Wallet™ transforms your clunky heavy keychain into a beautiful, flat and credit card sized fashion accessory, which naturally fits into your wallet.Yes, in your wallet, but not only in your wallet.All Key2Wallet models are designed in exactly the same size as a credit card. So:-  It fits anywhere your credit card would fit  -This feature also makes it possible to use Key2Wallet as a keyholder for your spare keys in your wallet.Money clips, USB sticks and even car keys can be attached to your K2W. However, please keep in mind that K2W may not fit in your wallet if you attach those items, depending on the size of your personal wallet. Key2Wallet™ features soft and tumbled premium leather which builds its character with use.The colors of the leather that we use have been picked from the 2017 fashion catalog, so you will catch the colors of the next season just in time!Please note that the actual color of the leather may vary slightly from the images shown due to the nature of leather and your monitor/screen color settings.Additional Insider Information: The leather we have picked is currently also being used by the world's biggest smart phone company, for their officially certified leather cases. None of the keys attached to your Key2Wallet™ touch each other; therefore, we call it ""naturally silent"".

<h2>WEARABLE WITHOUT SOCKS</h2>
<p>The small air chambers in our wool regulate the temperature in the shoe. So we have a cool down experience in the hot summer months and a warm up experience in the cold winter months. The collection of our wool is cruelty free (e.g. mulesing) and we take care of the animals by applying strict standards for our merino yarn suppliers.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>BIO BASED FOOTBED</h2>
<p>Our changeable footbed is made from an organic eco ortholite® formulation which includes natural, plant-based castor bean oil - that makes the footbed really soft and comfortable. In addition, the footbed is a renewable resource which reduces the shoe‘s ecological footprint. </p>

<h3><span>What your help means to us<br/></span></h3>
<p><span><br/>Your contribution to this campaign will ensure that the people who work with us will have their expenses covered.  We are all doing this for the love of our community and for fashion and no matter if we reach our goal not, this show will be going on.  We carefully went over all the costs of the production with an eye towards efficiency, and came to the figure of being able to put on this show for $2,500.  These funds will go to cover the materials used by our hair stylists and makeup artists, physical aspects of production (runways are expensive) as well the costs associated with the design and printing of our official lookbook, which will feature all the garments and accessories featured in our show and the places where you could purchase them for yourself!<br/></span></p>
<h3>
<br/>Why We Are Doing It!</h3>
<div>It is really easy to see runway shows as frivolous things, but it is important to realize that this is one of the only kind of venues for designers and local boutiques to present their goods in an engaging way.  Like a gallery opening is a statement about the painter, a runway show is an exhibition featuring the creativity of not only the stylists who dress the models, but for the people who crafted the garments and collected them in the first place! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Everyone on our team is accomplished when it comes to fashion and production. Our Lead Stylist, Eric Belladonna, in addition to being a local fashion icon, also directed a successful runway show for a previous SubZERO festival.  His vision for this show heavily draws from the rococo influence of the New Romantics and Adam Ant, fused with graffiti inspired street culture that is so prevalent in San Jose.  The show is being produced and coordinated by Drew Clark, who has been working with SubZERO for the last four years as the organizer for its figure drawing stage.  He also has experience organizing events for South First Fridays, San Jose Stage Company and was the organizer for San Jose's chapter of Dr. Sketchy's Anti-Art School.</div>

Since early in her childhood she’s been obsessed with clothing and its creative expression, which drove her into getting a degree in apparel design. She enjoys art in many forms. On her free time you can find her watching movies, drawing, painting, taking photos and spending time with her family.

<p>At this stage we begin by unzipping inner hood. This will allow you to connect shoelace earphones and auxiliary cable with one another while also allowing you to feed both earphones through to left and right drawstring stitch holes.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""> </p>

<p><b>STEP 2 - CONNECT AUXILIARY CABLE TO SHOELACE EAPRHONES</b></p>
<p>You now connect the auxiliary cable and shoelace earphones outside of hood. Connecting outside of hood is much easier than placing hands inside hood. Secure connection securely otherwise technical issues may occur.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>STEP 9 - REMOVE RUBBER EARBUDS FROM EARPHONE HEAD</b></p>
<p>Before implanting shoelace earphones into STX Hoodie you must remove rubber buds on earphones as it allows feeding through to stitched drawstring hole much easier compared to leaving the rubber buds on and it getting caught on the cotton of inner hoodie as you feed through.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>STEP 10 - FEED SHOELACE EARPHONE TO SEPERATE DRAWSTRING HOLES </b></p>
<p>Begin by holding the base of either the left or right earphone (does not matter which one you start with) and feed your hand into the unzipped hood. Be sure to have a solid grip on earphone as you feed through, we suggest using thumb and index finger.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1450843975/h1yodh5yuminouekbbta.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p> <p> </p>
</div><div>
<p><b>STEP 11 - GENTLY SLIDE EARPHONE THROUGH DRAWSTRING HOLE</b></p>
<p>When feeding earphone through to drawstring hole you will reach the stitched hole, at this point remove hand from interior of hood and gently slide through earphone by shuffling through with index finger and thumb on hood lining as seen below. Same process for second earphone on opposite side to initial inserted earphone.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>STEP 12 - PULL THROUGH EARPHONE TO DESIRED LENGTH</b></p>
<p>Once the head of earphone has been fed through drawstring hole you can extend shoelace to the length you are comfortable with. Please take caution when pulling through right earphone as microphone is implanted within right earphone shoelace. We suggest you take this step nice and slow. </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>STEP 13 - CONNECT SMARTPHONE IN HIDDEN POCKET</b></p>
<p>Upon successfully pulling through auxiliary cable (male end) to hidden pocket you can connect your chosen smartphone and place in pocket safely with hidden pocket zipper closed. </p> <p><b>STEP 14 - CLOSE INNER HOOD ZIPPER AND YOU ARE READY TO GO!</b></p>
<p>Final step in the process is to close over zipper and pick the hoodie up and make sure it feels comfortable and cables are at chosen lengths.

</div><div>The above timeline has been strategised heavily by the team at STX. Many Indiegogo campaigns fail to clearly explain to consumers what the time frame is from a perk being ordered to it arriving at the desired destination. One area that may cause delays is Chinese New Year. We are very aware of this and suppliers we have chosen as first contact will continue manufacturing during this period so our backer's dont have any delays in receiving their STX Hoodie. </div><div> </div><div>We have also prepared back up suppliers for each component of STX Hoodie meaning if any of our suppliers close down for holidays or cannot meet timelines we will go to secondary sources to ensure above timeline once again is met for backer's sake.

<div>$119.99 Australian Dollars</div>
<div> </div>

</div>
<div><b>9. Are the zippers rust proof? </b></div>
<div>Yes the zippers are 100% rust proof and manufactured at a very high quality. This not only makes interaction with all STX Hoodie zippers smooth and un-interrupted, but gives a glowing high quality gold finish which again will not lose quality if washed correctly. </div>
<div> </div>
<div><b>10. Will STX Hoodie be available in my local sports/streetwear store?</b></div>

<div>The STX Lacephones have been developed in house with support from manufacturers within Shenzhen, China. The Lacephone was designed for an all round performance which supports all types of music and vocal pitches. STX Lacephones rival the best earphones available today. </div>
<div> </div>
<div><b>14. How long will my STX Hoodie last if I wear it every day of the week?</b></div>
<div>Life expectancy of STX Hoodie if washed correctly is above 5 years. Most hoodies available today fall apart within months, not STX Hoodie! The 100% cotton used ensures that the garment maintains strength, fit and stitching for years to come. </div>
<div> </div>

<div> </div>
<div><b>17. I own a very old mobile phone, will this work with the STX Hoodie?</b></div>
<div>Yes, all phones that have a female auxiliary port are compatible with STX Hoodie 1.0. We chose to use the auxiliary cable in version 1.0 for this exact reason so that backers who may have very old phones can still be a part of STX Hoodie! </div>
<div> </div>
<div><b>18. How long does it take to remove STX Lacephones from STX Hoodie?</b></div>
<div>After days of timing ourselves removing STX Lacephones we found after the first go it takes no more than 60 seconds, this not being rushed and removing slowly and calmly. Be patient on your first go though, it may take a couple of minutes as a new STX Hoodie owner. </div>
<div> </div>
<div><b>19. <b>How long does it take to embed STX Lacephones into STX Hoodie?</b></b></div>
<div>Very similar to question 19, embedding STX Lacephones take no more than 60 seconds. As you continue to use your STX Hoodie you become very familiar with the process which will shorten the time even more. Again, be patient on your first attempt, it can take a little longer as a new STX Hoodie owner. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<p><b>20. <b>Will my current earphones work with auxiliary cable and vice versa?</b></b></p>
<p>If you use a set of earphones or an auxiliary cable currently which has 3 tier coating on the male plug you are all set to go! You can check this by simply looking at the male end of your cable (earphones or auxiliary) and check for 3 rings. </p>
</div>
</div></div>","STEP 1 - UNZIP INNER HOOD ZIPPER
At this stage we begin by unzipping inner hood. This will allow you to connect shoelace earphones and auxiliary cable with one another while also allowing you to feed both earphones through to left and right drawstring stitch holes.
 
  
STEP 2 - CONNECT AUXILIARY CABLE TO SHOELACE EAPRHONES
You now connect the auxiliary cable and shoelace earphones outside of hood. Connecting outside of hood is much easier than placing hands inside hood. Secure connection securely otherwise technical issues may occur.
 
 STEP 3 - FEED MALE END OF AUXILIARY INTO HOOD ZIPPER
By feeding the male end of auxiliary cable through hood to right side it will allow you to pull cable through stitched hole (again, this is located on right side) which leads to hidden zipper.
  
STEP 4 - PULL AUX THROUGH STITCH HOLE ABOVE INNER ZIPPER
Once auxiliary cord is fed through right side of inner hood you are ready to place into inner zipper. 
  
 
STEP 5 - FEED AUX INTO TOP SECTION OF INNER ZIPPER
Feed the auxiliary cord into the top section of inner zipper. 
  
STEP 6 - PULL AUXILIARY CORD TO REACH INNER POCKET
Once you have fed auxiliary cable through inner hoodie stitch hole on right side and furthermore into top of inner zipper, you know must gently pull down on cable to give at least fifty centimetres (50cm) so that cord can reach inner smartphone pocket. 
 
 STEP 7 - FEED AUXILIARY THROUGH TO HIDDEN POCKET
Begin by unzipping hidden pocket inside right side of hoodie. When pocket is unzipped take male end of auxiliary cable and feed into pocket through stitched hole.

 
 
STEP 8 - COMPLETELY CLOSE INNER ZIPPER FROM BASE TO TOP
Close inner hidden zipper from base to top neatly concealing auxiliary cord. More or less cable auxiliary cord length can be adjusted by pulling at either end of cord (inside hood or inside hidden smartphone pocket). 
 

 

 
 
STEP 9 - REMOVE RUBBER EARBUDS FROM EARPHONE HEAD
Before implanting shoelace earphones into STX Hoodie you must remove rubber buds on earphones as it allows feeding through to stitched drawstring hole much easier compared to leaving the rubber buds on and it getting caught on the cotton of inner hoodie as you feed through.
 
 

 
STEP 10 - FEED SHOELACE EARPHONE TO SEPERATE DRAWSTRING HOLES 
Begin by holding the base of either the left or right earphone (does not matter which one you start with) and feed your hand into the unzipped hood. Be sure to have a solid grip on earphone as you feed through, we suggest using thumb and index finger.
 
  

STEP 11 - GENTLY SLIDE EARPHONE THROUGH DRAWSTRING HOLE
When feeding earphone through to drawstring hole you will reach the stitched hole, at this point remove hand from interior of hood and gently slide through earphone by shuffling through with index finger and thumb on hood lining as seen below. Same process for second earphone on opposite side to initial inserted earphone.
 

 
STEP 12 - PULL THROUGH EARPHONE TO DESIRED LENGTH
Once the head of earphone has been fed through drawstring hole you can extend shoelace to the length you are comfortable with. Please take caution when pulling through right earphone as microphone is implanted within right earphone shoelace. We suggest you take this step nice and slow. 

 
STEP 13 - CONNECT SMARTPHONE IN HIDDEN POCKET
Upon successfully pulling through auxiliary cable (male end) to hidden pocket you can connect your chosen smartphone and place in pocket safely with hidden pocket zipper closed.  STEP 14 - CLOSE INNER HOOD ZIPPER AND YOU ARE READY TO GO!
Final step in the process is to close over zipper and pick the hoodie up and make sure it feels comfortable and cables are at chosen lengths. Now you are all set to enjoy the full usage of your brand new STX Hoodie. We hope you enjoy the product as much as we enjoyed creating it for you. Welcome to the family!
 


 
 
 The simplest, most accessible way to use your smartphone is here! Simple, comfortable and un-interrupted playback of music from your smart device while also recieving phone calls through your STX shoelace earphones while wearing your STX Hoodie.
 STX Hoodie keeps it very simple; your auxiliary cord which connects to your smartphone in hidden pocket feeds through from the bottom to top of STX Hoodie inner zipper and connects to shoelace earphones inside hood. Inner hood can be accessed easily by unzipping zipper that is hidden in centre of hood stitch line. 
 When our team designed the STX Hoodie it was imperative that the hood functionality was not effected with any new channels/zippers we added to the current hoodie layout standards. We are very happy that full use of hoodie is available like all of your other hoodies. When the weather turns the hood is needed.
 
 We have sourced the highest quality earbuds available to ensure all owners receive the best experience possible with their favourite music and during calls. Earphones can be used separately when removed from STX Hoodie with your chosen devices. 
 
 

Thick style inner zipper that neatly sits right inner side of hoodie. This is the area that holds the aux cord from smartphone to hood hidden away from your view.
 


STX Hoodie has an inner pocket that will hold any size smartphone from Samsung Galaxy 2 to iPhone 6+. The reason for placing pocket on inside is to allow you full use of outer pockets to hold other items or place hands inside when it's cold.
 

All backers will receive a pair of shoelace earphones which STX Hoodie refers to as 'Lacephones'. 
 


Also included is an 80cm auxiliary cord which fits neatly into all sizes of STX Hoodie from hidden smartphone pocket to inner hood.
 
 

STX Hoodie user manual will help you to find out how to remove and implant cords and shoelace earphones, material specifications and STX Brand Mission which we strive towards every single day for our customers and partners. 
 

STX use test tubes in our design workshops to keep electronics components and materials organised. We want those who support our campaign to receive a test tube case to hold their shoelace earphones. Its only right to provide this perk now they are becoming part of the STX Family!
 
 

All backers will receive an STX Gym Bag which upon unboxing contains STX Hoodie. From research gym bags are used in a whole variety of ways outside of gym and fitness requirements. We want all of our backers to have one to do what you would like with it! Use for work, travel, storage and much more!
 
STX team is one that is very aware of its own carbon footprint and when it came to packaging STX Hoodie we sourced the most eco-friendly packaging possible. STX shipping box is 100% fully recyclable with logo ink on box being used again from recycled materials. 

 
 

 


Street Technology Experiments have sourced the highest quality fabric available being pre-washed 100% true black cotton with a weight of 320 grams per square metre. In short, it is highly durable and extremelly comfortable. 
 


 
 
 
 
 



 

 
 
 

So much technology today requires the correct operating system. From day one, the team at STX made sure that all technology used was totally compatible with not just smartphones but any kind of device that has an auxiliary outlet. The hidden pocket for smartphone is a size that can accomodate all smartphones available currently on the market. 


Here's a breakdown of the perks you can choose from when you support this campaign (select perk from sidebar at top of this page). All perks include at least one STX Hoodie, one pair STX Black Lacephones, one STX Gym Bag, 80cm Male to Female Auxiliary cable, one STX Lacephones Case and an STX Hoodie 1.0 User Manual (compatible with all smartphones). 
 



The above timeline has been strategised heavily by the team at STX. Many Indiegogo campaigns fail to clearly explain to consumers what the time frame is from a perk being ordered to it arriving at the desired destination. One area that may cause delays is Chinese New Year. We are very aware of this and suppliers we have chosen as first contact will continue manufacturing during this period so our backer's dont have any delays in receiving their STX Hoodie.  We have also prepared back up suppliers for each component of STX Hoodie meaning if any of our suppliers close down for holidays or cannot meet timelines we will go to secondary sources to ensure above timeline once again is met for backer's sake. We know what it is like to wait on an exciting item you have purchase online; we will do our best to get it to you in the most professional and time effective way possible!

During our extensive research in finding out ""what information do backers want to see on an Indiegogo campaign"" one of the main components that was missing according to consumers, even from the most successful campaigns was transparently communicating to backers where funding will go if a campaign they support surpass its required funding goal.  STX Hoodie will, if we receive the rare opportunity of stretch funding from our amazing backers, be placing additional funding towards new STX outerwear garments and furthermore STX Hoodie 2.0 Edition. The below visually displays this:

<p>When I first introduced gLove, the
feedback was really great. I got several rewards for creative business ideas…
and before I could make any further steps, I got hit by a serious autoimmune
disease which disabled me for almost a year. I was bedridden for several months and was not sure if I will be able to get to work again. Then I met my boyfriend whose endless support convinced me to give it a go despite my illness. So here I am, being able to walk again, and even with debilitating disease, making my dreams (with your help) come true :) </p>

<p>We manufacture gLoves in my mum's sewing workshop. That enables us to pay attention to every single detail because we can control the whole process. But in
some aspects, we are limited. At this moment embroideries are being delivered
by other local provider. If we are able to raise $25 000, we will be able to buy
our own embroidery machine which would help us tremendously. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">We have many more great ideas and designs waiting to be seen!</span></p>

Thank you very much for your support!<br/><h3><br/></h3><h3><br/></h3></div>","The brand was started three years
ago by me (Eliska) – after a walk with my small nephew in the winter. We both
had separate gloves and it was quite difficult to hold the kid’s hand tight. So
I realized it would be much more safe (and still comfortable) to hold the hand straight
away but still be in a warm glove. I went through a long journey
finding the best shape, style
and fabrics, as well as finding funny embroideries which children would love.
Luckily my mum is owner of small family business - sewing workshop, so after a few weeks we had the final version. And a special committee consisting of my nephews (7&5 at that time) approved our embroideries :) My friend with her little daughter were my first testers.Later on, I created the version for couples in love as well! So if you like going for a walk hand in hand with your beloved one, this is the best choice. 
When I first introduced gLove, the
feedback was really great. I got several rewards for creative business ideas…
and before I could make any further steps, I got hit by a serious autoimmune
disease which disabled me for almost a year. I was bedridden for several months and was not sure if I will be able to get to work again. Then I met my boyfriend whose endless support convinced me to give it a go despite my illness. So here I am, being able to walk again, and even with debilitating disease, making my dreams (with your help) come true :) 

I would be very grateful for any help
you can provide (see perks on the right).




Our main goal is to get gLove out
there and thats how we have set up our campaign!


We manufacture gLoves in my mum's sewing workshop. That enables us to pay attention to every single detail because we can control the whole process. But in
some aspects, we are limited. At this moment embroideries are being delivered
by other local provider. If we are able to raise $25 000, we will be able to buy
our own embroidery machine which would help us tremendously. We have many more great ideas and designs waiting to be seen!





We have (hopefully) minimized all risks in the line of producing the gLoves. It may become a challenge to get all the gLoves assembled in a reasonable amount of time IF we get more orders than we bargained for.
