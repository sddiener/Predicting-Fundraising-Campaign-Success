<strong>Steps to a Green Future</strong> - We are mobilizing the world's two most powerful energy sources, the love of parents for their children and the incredible persuasive (nagging) power of kids.  About 50% of the carbon we put into the air comes from household energy use, food, transportation and the consumer goods we buy.  Cutting that number will be incredibly helpful to insure our kids have a livable future.  Families that participate in this program work in companies and for government agencies where they can carry the message upward.  We expect this transformation to a clean and green future will ""bubble up"" to leaders from families all over the country as they go step by step to sustainability.

<h3>The Story of Watson Elementary (It's Elementary, Watson!)</h3>
<p>The story our artist, Jim Haynes, is creating for us with his wit and drawing ability is incredibly engaging.  For instance he has created two space characters, Kandou and Kantdou, from MOUGA (Make Our Universe Green Again) who are observing Earth and wondering whether we're going to be able to accomplish the goals that our hero, Professor Green, has set for the kids at Watson Elementary.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1583010726/z65r8hytoc5xryovswo1.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Professor Green conducts activity classes for every grade level. Each grade gets to study one animal, such as monarch butterflies, bees, manatees, sea turtles, dolphins, black bears, polar bears, penguins or puffins, stressing the problems that creature faces because of people.  These activity sessions use music and games and other experiential learning techniques.  Here are kids lining up to go to their activity session.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1583014471/doukaptgbj3781hlhs2u.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p>We're sure you can see how engaging the faces and how animated the characters are even in these preliminary sketches.  We explain in the book that the ""Professor Green"" who comes to the school might be a man or a woman.  Everyone who delivers a Green Actioneers program is ""Professor Green.""  You can become ""Professor Green.""  If your students are already aware of the need to ""go green,"" you can skip right to Family night, pass out the books and challenge families to get to work.</p>
<p>Once we get into the discussion of steps families can take to ""go green"" he brings the space travelers back in visual jokes, like when they mistake a washing machine for a long-lost relative.  This ""Where's Waldo"" type feature makes it fun to leaf through the book and look for Kandou and Kantdou who are often hiding.</p>

<p>If you've read this far I know we can count on you to order at least one book, and you probably are  entranced by Jim Haynes' artwork.  So please do order a book for yourself, one to give to a local elementary or K-8 school and you might want to spring for a piece of Jim's finished art, suitable for framing.  And because I was formerly a professional juggling instructor who visited over 2,000 schools in 46 states and 12 countries in my 30 year career, I've included some of my juggling DVDs, books and US made Juggle-eze juggling scarves as premiums.  These items are not available anywhere else, so get them while they last.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong> How the Green Actioneers Handbook is organized </strong>- Our book is unique because it appeals to both kids and parents.  There are over 100 potential actions families can take to go green.  Every two-page spread describes one action with the parents' page on the left that tells briefly about some of the benefits of that action, and the kids' page on the right with a coloring book and a crossword puzzle, or other challenge for older kids.  The book will be bilingual in English and Spanish from the start.  The link on each page leads to much more thorough information on the website.</li>
<li>
<strong>The story in the book - </strong>The story line follows three families, Bobby's urban family living in an apartment and dependent on public transportation, Lakesha's suburban family with a big house and three cars and Ken Chen's rural family with a mini-farm on the urban fringe.  Their kids are all in the same classroom at Watson Elementary school and the book follows each of these families as they ""go green."" Readers can follow the adventures of a family similar to their own, or select from all three. </li>
<li>
<strong>The book will connect families to The Green Actioneers website </strong>- Using links and QR codes we connect each action in the book to a much longer description of that action on our website.  What we are creating might be called ""The Wikipedia™ of Green"" for families and we expect to continue to research and expand the actions for years to come with the help of sustainability students from many colleges.  So anyone can become a researcher for the website.</li>
<li>
<strong>Green businesses in every community can be involved</strong> - Local businesses that agree to provide rebates to schools for actions by families will be added to this program.  It is up to your school to approach local ""green"" businesses.  After their school has activated this feature, if a family installs solar on their roof or purchases or leases an electric vehicle, re-insulates their home, adds double-paned windows, or a reflective roof, then the school will get a rebate from participating vendors.</li>

Parents and kids know that they need to save energy but they don't have a roadmap to follow.  That's why more than 60 impassioned University of Central Florida interns have created The Green Actioneers Workbook: The Definitive Family Guide to Going Green, Saving Money for Families and Saving the Planet for Kids and the supporting website.

This book will be fun for the kids and we trust it will be equally engaging for the grownups.  ""Mom, let's do this one next"" should be something parents hear all the time as kids help parents discover the pathway to a clean and green future that work for them.  Our book has been ""crowd-sourced"" with the help of over over 60 interns in the sustainability program at University of Central Florida, and their Professor, Dr. Richard Plate.  Here's just one semester's crew, from Spring 2019.  They helped with research on over 100 actions.  


Here is the Fall 2019 crew of interns, helping to design this fund-raiser, shoot some test videos, begin to create puzzles and games and help polish the manuscript.

This is our current group of 20 interns helping with writing extensive blogs, social media marketing, creating games and puzzles for every page, helping with Spanish translation and helping promote this campaign.


Steps to a Green Future - We are mobilizing the world's two most powerful energy sources, the love of parents for their children and the incredible persuasive (nagging) power of kids.  About 50% of the carbon we put into the air comes from household energy use, food, transportation and the consumer goods we buy.  Cutting that number will be incredibly helpful to insure our kids have a livable future.  Families that participate in this program work in companies and for government agencies where they can carry the message upward.  We expect this transformation to a clean and green future will ""bubble up"" to leaders from families all over the country as they go step by step to sustainability. All the other plans we have heard about assume that the transformation to a sustainable future will ""trickle down"" from our leaders.  How is that transformation going so far?
For mankind to take giant leaps, individuals must take small steps.

The Story of Watson Elementary (It's Elementary, Watson!)
The story our artist, Jim Haynes, is creating for us with his wit and drawing ability is incredibly engaging.  For instance he has created two space characters, Kandou and Kantdou, from MOUGA (Make Our Universe Green Again) who are observing Earth and wondering whether we're going to be able to accomplish the goals that our hero, Professor Green, has set for the kids at Watson Elementary.

 
Professor Green conducts activity classes for every grade level. Each grade gets to study one animal, such as monarch butterflies, bees, manatees, sea turtles, dolphins, black bears, polar bears, penguins or puffins, stressing the problems that creature faces because of people.  These activity sessions use music and games and other experiential learning techniques.  Here are kids lining up to go to their activity session.

And here's Professor Green helping students experience the problems that frogs face because of humans.

In the all-school assembly at the end of the day Professor Green tells the kids about Family Night that same evening.

 
 
 
Here's the Professor making his presentation at Family Night.

 
We're sure you can see how engaging the faces and how animated the characters are even in these preliminary sketches.  We explain in the book that the ""Professor Green"" who comes to the school might be a man or a woman.  Everyone who delivers a Green Actioneers program is ""Professor Green.""  You can become ""Professor Green.""  If your students are already aware of the need to ""go green,"" you can skip right to Family night, pass out the books and challenge families to get to work.
Once we get into the discussion of steps families can take to ""go green"" he brings the space travelers back in visual jokes, like when they mistake a washing machine for a long-lost relative.  This ""Where's Waldo"" type feature makes it fun to leaf through the book and look for Kandou and Kantdou who are often hiding.

Or when they fall asleep on the thick insulation in the attic.

 
Here's are a few pieces of finished art so you can see the quality.

Houseplants can clean your air.

Buy in Thrift stores and donate your unneeded items.

Carry your own water from home.

Compost your kitchen waste.

Help your community compost waste wisely.

Here's a typical two-page spread with English and Spanish on the parent's or left hand page and the coloring book and a word puzzle on the right hand page.
Meanwhile back to the character development and storyline.  Early on we decided to create a story with close attention to issues of equity.  That is where the Green Actioneers cape comes in.  If they wish, each classroom teacher will have a cape that will be worn up until first recess by the student who, in the early morning, tells her or his classmates what their family has done to ""go green.""  

In our example Bobby's family consists of three adopted kids and two Moms who live in an apartment in the downtown area and they don't have a car, so Bobby gets to wear the cape first, because his less affluent family is already acting in a very environmentally conscious manner.

Green businesses in every community can be involved - Local businesses that agree to provide rebates to schools for actions by families will be added to this program.  It is up to your school to approach local ""green"" businesses.  After their school has activated this feature, if a family installs solar on their roof or purchases or leases an electric vehicle, re-insulates their home, adds double-paned windows, or a reflective roof, then the school will get a rebate from participating vendors.

Impact

This workbook can serve as a ""cookbook"" for going green, saving money for families, making money for schools and helping kids create a clean and green future.
Your PTA or other sponsor can keep half the money from sale of the book. Contact us about how your organization can buy books in quantities of 100 at wholesale for as little as $10 (plus shipping), and sell it to families for $20.
Links in the book connect to ""The website of choice for families who want to 'go green.'"" 
Actions by families can provide substantial rebates to schools from local ""green"" businesses, once set in motion by the school.
The book can lead to the creation of a closed social network for every classroom where kids can post their ""wins"" and show their friends how they are doing.
This book does not mention the negative consequences of doing nothing.  It is in no way scary or accusatory.  It never mentions climate change or global warming or sea-level rise.  We don't say ""Here's how bad it could be if we did everything wrong.""  We say ""Here's how great it will be when we do everything right!""


Other Ways You Can Help

Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:

Get the word out about this campaign on social media. We can be found at https://www.facebook.com/greenactioneers/ and https://www.linkedin.com/company/greenactioneers/

Go to your local school and talk to the PTA, the Principal and interested teachers about the program, then get in touch with us and we'll follow up with them.
Talk to religious groups, scouts, the ""Y"", 4-H clubs, homeschool groups and other youth or family organizations about introducing a Green Actioneers program.
Anyone can become Professor Green.  A teacher or parent in your school or students from a nearby university can bring in the books, hold Family Night, and start a program.
Anyone from your school can work with local ""green"" businesses to set up a relationship where your PTA or other organization gets significant rebates when families from your school make purchases from these partners. 
Please use the Indiegogo share tools with your friends and colleagues!


You can introduce this program yourself in your own school using the instructions in the book, however, if you want to get trained to go to schools and introduce the program and the book, please get in touch with us.  Thanks in advance for sharing this campaign widely and encouraging everyone you know to pre-buy a book (or two).  With hard work and a focus on the end results we can make a huge difference in the future of our beloved Earth.

<p>""<b>Let`s Do It, Romania!</b>"" is a social movement that started in 2009 with a group of people from different professional fields (IT, communication, finance, NGO) who decided to organize a National Clean Up Day. The legal entity behind this movement is called “Viitorul in Zori” and it is a non governmental apolitical association.</p>
<p><b>Why would I donate to your cause?</b></p>
<p>1. Because we’ve had tangible results over the last 5 years (1 million volunteers involved, 22 500 tons of trash collected) and we have showed credibility and trust all along the way. In Romania, we have a clean, trustworthy image and “<b>Let`s Do It!</b>” is a powerful brand with one of the biggest communities of dedicated volunteers locally. Also, we are part of an international movement that has a huge impact and relevant results: “<b>Let`s Do It, World!</b>” started in 2008, involving more than 11 millions volunteers and 112 countries in their clean ups all around the world.</p>
<p>2. Because our app is essential for the digital era we live in, helping you have a clean planet, a cleaner city or even neighborhood, a dream shared by millions of people worldwide. It’s easy to use, it helps you save nature in half the time with half the effort and you can be a volunteer anywhere, anytime, with just a swipe on your smartphone!  </p>
<p><b>Why is the app developed first in Romania?</b></p>
<p>“<b>Let`s Do It, Romania!</b>” team came up with this idea: we wanted to bring this social movement to the next level. Romania is one of the first countries that organized a National Clean Up Day and one of the strongest countries in the “<b>Let`s Do It, World!</b>” community, being a role model and a source of inspiration for other countries involved. Thus, Romania is going to be simply the first happy country to test it - more countries will follow in the next months. Right now we need your support for building it so everyone around the world can benefit!</p>
<p><b>How is the budget split up?</b></p>
<p>Everything you donate will go directly into building the mobile app and the software administration platform behind it, which will be used to sustain and update live the Garbage Map and automatically generate reports based on your pins for the local authorities in charge. You can see our budget split above with full transparency.</p>
<p><b>How did you start the partnership with QUALITANCE?</b></p>
<p>After coming up with the idea of the app, we made some research to find out what companies would be capable to develop the platform. We discussed with several companies in Romania and we immediately chose to work with <b>QUALITANCE</b> for 3 reasons:</p>
<p>- they came up with a well structured plan and a very creative solution to our brief</p>
<p>- they offered not only to build our platform and app but also to partially support the costs (for every dollar you donate, <b>QUALITANCE</b> will contribute with 1 dollar as well)</p>
<p>- they have a great team, strong professionals, very friendly and helpful</p>
<p><b>What if you raise more money than planned?</b></p>
<p>If more money than required is raised we’re building even more features for the app and platform, making volunteering even easier for you.</p>
<p><b>How will QUALITANCE help you in this process?</b></p>
<p><b>QUALITANCE</b> will not only help us develop the mobile app and the entire software platform behind it, but also match all the donations 1 to 1.</p>
<p><b>Who can use this app?</b></p>
<p>The app will be available for free in Google Play or App Store starting 1st of July for Android and iOS. For using our app and being a digital volunteer, you simply need a smartphone and a wi-fi connection or mobile internet.</p>
<p><b>What happens when I pin a pile of trash with the app?</b></p>
<p>The pile will be uploaded to the Garbage Map instantly over WI-FI and updated later when you hit a hot spot if you don’t have a connection.  ""<b>Let`s Do It, Romania!</b>"" team checks it, approves it and generates an official report sent to the authorities in charge to clean it. </p>
<p>The ""<b>Let`s Do It, Romania!</b>"" team will monitor every report until the pile is cleaned: also, you receive regular updates and notifications about the status of the pile.</p>

Right now we need your support for building it so everyone around the world can benefit!
How is the budget split up?
Everything you donate will go directly into building the mobile app and the software administration platform behind it, which will be used to sustain and update live the Garbage Map and automatically generate reports based on your pins for the local authorities in charge. You can see our budget split above with full transparency.
How did you start the partnership with QUALITANCE?
After coming up with the idea of the app, we made some research to find out what companies would be capable to develop the platform. We discussed with several companies in Romania and we immediately chose to work with QUALITANCE for 3 reasons:
- they came up with a well structured plan and a very creative solution to our brief
- they offered not only to build our platform and app but also to partially support the costs (for every dollar you donate, QUALITANCE will contribute with 1 dollar as well)
- they have a great team, strong professionals, very friendly and helpful
What if you raise more money than planned?
If more money than required is raised we’re building even more features for the app and platform, making volunteering even easier for you.
How will QUALITANCE help you in this process?
QUALITANCE will not only help us develop the mobile app and the entire software platform behind it, but also match all the donations 1 to 1.
Who can use this app?
The app will be available for free in Google Play or App Store starting 1st of July for Android and iOS. For using our app and being a digital volunteer, you simply need a smartphone and a wi-fi connection or mobile internet.
What happens when I pin a pile of trash with the app?
The pile will be uploaded to the Garbage Map instantly over WI-FI and updated later when you hit a hot spot if you don’t have a connection.  ""Let`s Do It, Romania!"" team checks it, approves it and generates an official report sent to the authorities in charge to clean it. 
The ""Let`s Do It, Romania!"" team will monitor every report until the pile is cleaned: also, you receive regular updates and notifications about the status of the pile.",14.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><span>The Assemblage Union is a collection of salvaged materials that are donated in exchange for store points.  This encourages reuse behavior of things like plastics that are otherwise unable to be recycled, i.e. figurines, laminated or painted objects, packaging, and so on which would just end up in the waste stream, most likely the ocean.  Plastic is a major source of water pollution, and many times when an object is deemed broken or unusable, and cannot be donated as is the case with toys or games with missing pieces, these things are simply discarded.  They do not biodegrade, and remain in the environment indefinitely, causing devastation to the biosphere and it’s wildlife.  <br/></span></p>
<p><span>The premise of the Assemblage Union as a center for steampunk art forms is a celebration of the medium known as ‘mixed media assemblage’, wherein found objects are arranged into art, decor, wearables, and even functional pieces.  This is an ideal solution to the problem of plastics which cannot be recycled, but can be reused and revalued through art and design.  The Union issues tax credit and store credit for such objects, which may be acquired through cleaning, dumpster diving, leftovers from art projects, packaging, freecycling, or overruns from manufacturing processes.  Assigning a value to these materials encourages people to take the time to remove them from the waste stream, and collect on their reward, and making them available in bulk then facilitates entrepreneurship.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p>As a community fixture the Union provides workspace for entrepreneurs, meeting space, and hosts a variety of workshops and excursions.  One focus of this is on material usage, where patrons can gain knowledge and inspiration on the potential applications of the found objects.  Another is on the safe and legal acquisition of salvaged materials, and expeditions will be led in practices such as antiquing, ‘picking’, architectural salvage, and dumpster diving.  The Rivet Fleet, which hosts a number of vendor centric steampunk events throughout Metro Detroit will be managed through the Union, where it will continue to provide affordable opportunities for local small businesses to show their wares.  </p>
<p>  In addition to physical products, the Union will also generate an array of digital goods, such as stock photos, templates, textures, and other digital materials.  The evolution of this will expand into the territory of 3D scanning, and ultimately self serve printing.  This will enable us to take found objects that were donated, scan them in as components, and then sell the models for use in video game design, product design, environmental rendering, animation, film, and art.  There will also be a host of in house services such as digital photography, retouching, graphic design, formatting, print ordering, business resources, and rendering of 3D ecommerce environments in an initiative known as ‘The Arcade’.</p>  The world is moving toward the ability to print objects on demand, rather than rely on manufacturing in mass quantities, and ultimately this will be a more sustainable practice.  But there are so many objects already in circulation with limited life spans, that were produced without coordinating demand, or are broken and no longer useful.  The Assemblage Union will serve as a transition hub, revaluing and utilizing existing objects and removing them from their trajectory in the waste stream, and then making digital technologies available to the tinkers and inventors of tomorrow.  It will educate and empower the community with the skills they need to reimagine objects and their relation to us as humans, call attention to the issue of waste, and offer ways to eliminate it altogether by reassigning the hierarchy of values and popularizing salvage.  <p></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>At this stage of development, we need to establish the vision as a nonprofit and position ourselves to pursue other sources of funding.  We require $2500 to pay the initial registration and administrative costs, and to host a kickoff event to inspire and engage with the community to garner support.  This event is called A Day at the Races, it is also part of Etsy's Craft Party day which celebrates the entrepreneurs who make up the backbone of our team.  A combination of effective ecommerce platforms, and in person sales is the key to establishing a strong steampunk brand, earning income and getting the most out of the salvage experience!  </p>
<p>Some of the perks pertain to the event and include special bonuses, such as the exclusive 'Queen for a Day!' perk which coronates you the matriarch of our indie/handmade wedding good show section, and grants you authority over judgement of the Puppy Promenade all breed dog show, and Beauty in Bloom floral design competition!  </p>
<p>Another set of the perks relates to the Arcade, a digital frontier to reshape the
shopping experience!  It allows you to live the fantasy of owning a
storefront and appealing to customers in the third dimension, without the risk
or overhead of a brick and mortar store. 
Let your imagination run wild without the expense or restraints of
conventional construction, and display your product in an optimal setting.  The Arcade is the first of its kind, a
virtual mall filled with the finest steampunk wares.  Store fronts can be purchased in 25’x25’
units in any configuration desired, and decked out to the owner’s
specifications. Whether it’s inspired by things they have seen and liked, or
totally custom fixtures born from their unique needs, the Arcade is limited
only by your own imagination!  </p>
<p>The Arcade will ultimately be a service hosted by the Assemblage Union.  As

</div></div>","PLAN B - OCCUPY THE PLANETHow to build your own personal Karmameter and save the planet.Year after year, governments worldwide try new plans and programs to save the climate and our planet. Every time, we see no real results. And every time we hear that there is no Plan B!So here’s our Plan B: Ordinary people take action. We need ordinary people to stop following the status quo and explore new ways to save the planet.The way from idea to reality.I, Philip Dudzinski, have owned the café/bar Den Smagløse Café(DSC), www.densmagloesecafe.dk, in Odense, Denmark, for more than 20 years. Our café and its customers are dedicated to sustainability and put that into practice in our daily lives and business.As part of this, DSC worked with some of our suppliers to raise nearly $10,000 annually for different community purposes. The annual amount we receive from our suppliers is spent on cultural initiatives and projects by the staff and our customers.We want our suppliers to do the same with the thousands of customers they have all over the world. And they are all very interested in starting a worldwide green wave. Then thousands of suppliers can give away millions of dollars to customer/users through retailers. The customer/users can then use those millions of dollars to plant trees, support cancer research or what other purpose is lying close to their heart. The suppliers love the idéa.With this project we combine donation, marketing and sponsorship into sustainable marketing.Karmameter: The world's easiest way to measure “doing good” activities.Every user and business have a Karmameter on Plan B - Occupy the Planet.The Karmameter is an overview of your activities (or your business’ activities) on the site and on endorsements given to you by other people. You’ll be able to see your own Karma History, showing the activities you have DONE to make the world a better place.  A company donates money. A user makes an activity. The users Karma will increase on the Karmameter.Examples of other customer/user action:

Planting trees locally or globally


Support orangutangs in Borneo


Support cancer research


Supporting orphans locally or globally


Carbon reduction/compensation


Etc.

Endorsement: How to increase your personal Karma.The customer/user helps out and give time to a local sports club.Other examples:

Give time helping orphans locally


Visiting friend at nursing homes


Collecting waste in the nature


Plastic use management,


Etc.

Reward: How to get rewarded for your efforts in saving the Planet.The Karmameter encourages you to make little changes in your everyday life.You will then also get rewarded for your efforts by companies and celebrities and can spend your collected money on:

Sport


Museum


Music

News media
And much more
As a user, you can earn money and start to build your Karmameter. The money cannot be pulled out of the system. It must be spent within the platform.Users have the opportunity to earn money by carrying out a number of activities on the site, including (but not limited to):

Acquiring knowledge


Reading articles


Viewing learning videos


Testing your knowledge in quizzes


Volunteering your time


Coming up with sustainable solutions


And more……

<p><b>Summary:</b></p>
<p>The intent of this project is to reforest
areas of the Palani Hills range of the Western Ghats, Tamil Nadu, India, which have
been damaged by the practice of Hill Burning. 
By planting Indigenous tree species I hope to help revitalize biodiversity
and reverse the effects of soil erosion in the area, while working with local
people providing them with alternative opportunities for sustainable and
ecologically-oriented sources of income.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>My name is Senthil Kumar, I am 27 years
old and I have been lucky enough to live the majority of my life in the Tevankari
Watershed- a beautiful valley in the Palani Hills of the Western Ghats, Tamil
Nadu, India.</p>
<p>For the past two decades I have watched
the forests disappear, turning from lush green ecosystems full of life into
barren rock faces.  In some places, the
rivers no longer flow, streams have dried, and ponds have vanished.  Diverse wildlife species- including barking
deer, wild boars, bison, elephants, hares, flying squirrels, giant squirrels, snakes
and songbirds- have been displaced and endangered.  Having lived in this valley almost all my
life and having studied Ornithology, I can say with assurance that over the
past decade, ecological diversity in this valley has plummeted and continues to
do so at an ever increasing rate.</p>
<p>The main cause of ecological destruction
in this area is the practice of Hill Burning, that is, large-scale forest fires
started by humans for the purpose of cash cropping.  Once started, the fires spread across vast
areas, fuelled by dry grasses, displacing wildlife, burning vegetation and exposing
the soil.  When the rains come, with no vegetation
to hold the soil in place, it is washed down the hills and into the rivers.  Over an extended period of time, this causes major
soil erosion, leading to the desertification of the hills and eutrophication of
the waters.  As a result, vegetation can
no longer grow on the hills, waters are polluted, rivers are damned, and ecosystems,
which have sustained a diversity of life since time immemorial, are thrown out
of balance.</p>
<p>For many years, others and myself have
risked our lives fighting these fires with what little we have, with few
resources and no support.  Several years
ago, I participated in a socio-ecological survey, which discerned that Hill
Burning has laid waste to hundreds of hectares of land.  I started to explore solutions that would be
beneficial to both the land and those who depend on it.  I found that not only do Indigenous tree
species prevent the spread of fires, but they will also help to reverse the
process of desertification, revitalize the nutrient rich forest soils, and restore
damaged ecosystems.  After I gained this
understanding, I started actively planting trees and working with local NGOs
such as the Vatakanal Trust and the Palani Hills Conservation Society. </p>
<p>Now, I want to start a nursery in order
to build a sapling base so I can start planting trees and looking after them in
the areas that have been damaged by Hill Burning, in partnership with local
people.  By working with local people to
reforest the areas damaged by Hill Burning, I hope to provide them with an
alternative source of income, so they do not have to burn the hills to sustain
their livelihoods, but can earn money through tree planting instead.  I have a small farm from where I can base
these activities and have already planted over 1 500 trees in and around the
area.  However, I have exhausted my
limited resources doing so.  </p>
<p>I have calculated that it would cost
roughly $3.75 per sapling, including the costs of infrastructure, tools, labour,
and transportation.  I intend to grow,
plant, and maintain about 10 000 trees, over a 100 square km area.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>I have friends and experts in the field
of reforestation who are ready to help.  With my experience with Hill Burning and fire
fighting, my friends’ expertise in tree planting, and the support of local
people, I am very confident that this project will be a success.  Even if I do not raise the target funds, I
intend to start the nursery with the little I do raise.  I have given up my job in a corporate company
and even closed down my trekking company to dedicate myself completely to this
project.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Please contribute what you can and
spread the word.  You can keep an eye on your tree if you are contributing $50. You will be saving a child of the local tribal community during this winter if you contribute $100. Please share this
project with your friends through Indiegogo.</p>

<p>My name is Christina Morgan and I am a Biology graduate student at Tarleton State University and I need your help!  I want to investigate whether or not conditioning frogs reared in captivity improves their rate of survival when they meet a real predator.  Answering this question could improve amphibian conservation programs all over the world!<br/></p>
<p>Studies have shown that amphibians are capable of basic learning and even complex behaviors.  Research has also shown that most captive breeding reintroduction efforts fail, and one of the biggest challenges is predation.   Many amphibian species are facing extinction worldwide and have been 
taken into captivity so that they have a chance to be reintroduced to 
the wild.  Often, animals raised in captivity simply don't know how to avoid predators in the wild, and even for frogs, not all antipredator behaviors are innate.   When they encounter a predator for the first time, they don't know how to respond and have a much higher risk of being captured and eaten.  <br/></p>
<p>I plan to raise frogs from tadpoles or eggs and then condition them by exposing them to different stimuli, ranging from snake models to real snakes.  I will then test the frogs in an arena with a real snake to see if conditioning improves their rate of survival.  If conditioned frogs survive more often than naive (unconditioned) frogs, then conditioning could be a new tool for amphibian captive breeding conservation programs.  Amphibians are incredibly important to their ecosystems and I want to give conservation programs the best chance at reintroduction success possible!  <br/></p>
<p>I will be using the northern cricket frog (<i>Acris crepitans</i>) and garter snakes to complete my research.  Norther cricket frog populations are generally doing well in southern states, but in some northern states in the U.S. and in some areas of Canada, they have completely disappeared!  This makes them an excellent model species for this study and they may even need conservation programs for their species to survive one day.<br/></p> <ul></ul> <p><b>The biggest challenge my research faces right now is FUNDING! <br/></b></p>
<p>I have already invested nearly $1000.00 of my own money into my research but I cannot fund this project on my own.  I received a small grant from my university, but it won't be enough.  I need aquarium tanks, filters, gravel, aquarium plants, food for tadpoles, housing for frogs and snakes,  food for the snakes, UV lamps, crickets to feed the frogs, housing for the crickets, food for the crickets, and more.  I have already purchased many of these things with my own money, but I still need more supplies.  To feed the frogs I need for this project for only 6 months will cost over $2000.00 and that is only if I can successfully breed and hatch a portion of the crickets on my own!  <br/></p>
<p>None of your donations will pay for the facility I use, nor for an income for myself.  All money will be spent on materials or services for this project.  I am still applying for other research grants, but most grant processes are painstakingly slow and I need funding now to continue my research.  Please help me help amphibian conservation programs!<br/></p>
</div><div>If you can't donate, please forward this campaign to family, friends, and colleagues who might be able to do so or who might just be interested in finding out more.  Tell them about it, email them, share this campaign on Facebook!  Anyone who wants contact me before or after donating is welcome to do so by emailing me at christina.morgan@go.tarleton.edu.  Every little bit helps and is greatly appreciated. </div></div>","Can we condition naive frogs to have a better chance of surviving in the wild?

the wild.  Often, animals raised in captivity simply don't know how to avoid predators in the wild, and even for frogs, not all antipredator behaviors are innate.   When they encounter a predator for the first time, they don't know how to respond and have a much higher risk of being captured and eaten.  
I plan to raise frogs from tadpoles or eggs and then condition them by exposing them to different stimuli, ranging from snake models to real snakes.  I will then test the frogs in an arena with a real snake to see if conditioning improves their rate of survival.  If conditioned frogs survive more often than naive (unconditioned) frogs, then conditioning could be a new tool for amphibian captive breeding conservation programs.  Amphibians are incredibly important to their ecosystems and I want to give conservation programs the best chance at reintroduction success possible!  
I will be using the northern cricket frog (Acris crepitans) and garter snakes to complete my research.  Norther cricket frog populations are generally doing well in southern states, but in some northern states in the U.S. and in some areas of Canada, they have completely disappeared!  This makes them an excellent model species for this study and they may even need conservation programs for their species to survive one day.  The biggest challenge my research faces right now is FUNDING! 
I have already invested nearly $1000.00 of my own money into my research but I cannot fund this project on my own.  I received a small grant from my university, but it won't be enough.  I need aquarium tanks, filters, gravel, aquarium plants, food for tadpoles, housing for frogs and snakes,  food for the snakes, UV lamps, crickets to feed the frogs, housing for the crickets, food for the crickets, and more.  I have already purchased many of these things with my own money, but I still need more supplies.  To feed the frogs I need for this project for only 6 months will cost over $2000.00 and that is only if I can successfully breed and hatch a portion of the crickets on my own!  
None of your donations will pay for the facility I use, nor for an income for myself.  All money will be spent on materials or services for this project.  I am still applying for other research grants, but most grant processes are painstakingly slow and I need funding now to continue my research.  Please help me help amphibian conservation programs!
If you can't donate, please forward this campaign to family, friends, and colleagues who might be able to do so or who might just be interested in finding out more.  Tell them about it, email them, share this campaign on Facebook!  Anyone who wants contact me before or after donating is welcome to do so by emailing me at christina.morgan@go.tarleton.edu.  Every little bit helps and is greatly appreciated.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div><b>The Big Story in the Region - #Water</b></div>
<div>
<b></b><p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p>EnergyLab is based in UK, and  EnergyLab is a project development company which owns land in Sonora, Mexico.
EnergyLab wants to develop and permit for a 50,000MT desalination plant powered
by natural gas and solar. The facility will get bigger as more water off-takers are buying water. The land is located very close to the Sea of Cortez
and the desalination facility will supply potable water regionally to cities
and business, in the Sonora region of North America. The Sonora region covers not
only Sonora, Mexico but up over the boarder 60 miles in to the USA and more.
Water can be piped under the rail system to all the major cities in the region
or for special water off-takers rail roaded to industry or mines.</p>
<p>It
is widely known the South West of America and Northern Mexico have been in a
long term drought and added to this the main water supply from the River
Colorado has been over used. Water no longer reaches the Sea of Cortez or the Mexicali
delta, where wildlife suffers from the lack of water. The Colorado can no
longer fill Lake Mead a water reservoir for Arizona and the risk of a water
shortage from Lake Mead jumps to 75 percent in 2017, so Arizona will have water
shortages from 2018. At nearly 1,081 feet, Lake Mead’s water level is 148 feet
below capacity and dropping -- an elevation not seen since 1937, according to
the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Reclamation. Lake Mead is one
of the most important water resources in the West. Created in the 1930s, it
ensures a steady water supply for Arizona, Nevada, California, and northern Mexico
by holding back the flow of the Colorado River behind the Hoover Dam. It is one
of the largest water reservoirs in the world. When full, the lake contains
roughly the same amount of water as would have otherwise flowed through the
Colorado River over a two-year period: roughly 36 trillion liters (9.3 trillion
gallons). As of May 2003, Lake Mead was at roughly two-thirds of this capacity.</p>
<p>Already
California has had to reduce water use by 25% to stave off disaster in the big
cities and with $500USD fines for watering lawns. California’s drought
emergency, is now in its fourth year so Governor Jerry Brown (D) ordered on
April 1, 2015, a state wide 25 percent cut in urban water use, even though 80%
of all water is used by farming. There is no snow in the Sierra Nevada
mountains to supply water to the Colorado </p>
<p>Due
to intensive farming, water is being polluted by nitrates and now the Saltern Sea
in Imperial County, California, is drying up and will begin to cause
environmental problems. Farmers have jumped in to cash crops like cashew and
wall nuts which need lots of water to grow and massive irrigation networks.
If the drought
continues, California’s reservoirs will be empty in a year, NASA water
scientist Jay Famiglietti wrote in an op-ed published in the Los Angeles Times.
Many of the region’s major aquifers have been drained, so low they no longer
supply water to residents on the our skirts of cites and now they have to
connect to mains systems as they can no longer use their own wells. California has been
pumping groundwater at prodigious rates. About 75 percent of lost surface water
in the Central Valley has been replaced by groundwater. That’s a one-time fix,
using water that accumulated over hundreds of years. Farmers are now blocked
from drilling new wells or bringing back land into use if it requires any new
water irrigation. Some of the very over used aquifers are leaching cyanide from
the bed rocks something we normally equate with fracking disasters or suffer
nitrate pollution from farming fertilizers. In Sonora, Mexico two major mining pollution
incidents in the last 12 months have seen tons of iron ore waste put in the
Sonora River. Last Xmas 2014 , a gold mine lost tones of cyanide waste from a
holding tank into the Caborca Aquafer, which is a salt aquafer and is next to
the Sea of Cortez.</p>
<p>It’s
easy to see just from reading this intro the region has massive water problems
and water desalination could be part of the solution. Imagine the lost business
and real estate values after 2017 when Arizona announced water cutbacks which
has a 75% change of now happening. The Arizona Department of Water Resources'
2014 study of water supply sustainability suggests Arizona is likely to be
short, 1 million acre-feet in roughly that timeframe or 1,233,500,000MT or 3,380,000MT
daily.</p>
<p>This
does not count the potential water required for Sonora which could be 250,000MT
daily if the Jacqui tribe blocks water from their tribal lands into Hermosillo.
This does not count any of the problems Imperial County will have by 2020 and
the Saltern Sea is drying out and creating environmental problems. Mexico has
water legislation going through congress at this time which when finished will
allow Sonora’s municipalities to buy water from private suppliers. </p>
<p>In
the United States, a $1 billion plant is being built in Carlsbad, Calif., to
provide about 7 percent of the drinking water needs for the San Diego region.
When it goes online in late 2015 it will be the biggest in North America, with
a 50-million-gallon-per-day capacity or 190,000MT/M3. California currently has
about 16 desalination plant proposals in the works. A thousand gallons of
freshwater from a desalination plant costs the average U.S. consumer $2.50 to
$5, compared to $2 for conventional freshwater. Scientists predict California
will need 11 trillion gallons of water to recover from the drought -- the
equivalent of 1 1/2 Lake Meads.</p>
<p>Phil
Gordon, former mayor of Phoenix, has been an advocate of the desalination since
he visited the Middle East and saw how it has altered the landscape and economy
of countries like Dubai. He has proposed negotiating with Mexico to create
desalination plants on the Sea of Cortez that would benefit both countries.</p>
<p>“We
could turn a barren desert into farmland,” Gordon said. “Water, being such a
precious and critical component to growth and survival, is something we need to
make sure we have sufficient amounts of water.”</p>
<br/>
</div> </div> <p>And that's all there is to it.</p></div>","Short Summary The Sonora region of Mexico and USA, is experiencing massive water problems due to the over use of water in the region and drought.

<p>
</p>
<p>CaribShare Biogas is a social enterprise and registered charity in Jamaica
turning organic waste from hotels and small pig farms into biogas (type of biofuel)
and fertilizer.  The biogas is used to
produce clean electricity.  And, through
our <b><i>“Waste
to Cash”</i></b> program, up to 50% of our surplus revenues are shared with our
participating farmers to provide meaningful income.  In this way, we are helping to solve the
challenges of renewable energy, climate change, and rural poverty in Jamaica and the Caribbean.</p>
<p><b>Our Solution</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442518357/qilne0vl3exo3e16jezy.png"" src="""" style=""width: 445.8px;height: 372px;""/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>From winning the Inter-American Development Bank’s 2012 IDEAS
Energy Innovation Contest and receiving funding assistance from the Development Bank of Jamaica, we have enough monies to cover 85%
of the cost of constructing our biogas plant. 
We have also received financial advisory services from membership with the
Branson Center for Entrepreneurship – Caribbean.  And, we need your help to the raise the remaining
US $20K so we can start operating in Dec 2015. 
</p>
<p>The pilot digester that we are currently constructing in
Montego Bay will be the first biogas plant in Jamaica to produce electricity on
a sustained basis.  It will process over
1,400 tons of organic waste annually from the Sandals, Iberostar, Half Moon,
and RIU resorts, as well as over 50 small pig farms from seven communities in
Northern Trelawny – Stewart Town, Jackson Town, Clarks Town, Duncans, Marta
Brae, Stewart Castle, Bounty Hall.  Organic
waste collected includes kitchen scraps, left over buffet food, spoilt food,
cooking oils, and pig poo.</p>
<p>By participating in our <b><i>“Waste to Cash”</i></b> program, a farmer
with 50 pigs on average should earn initially at least US$1000 per year which will go a
great way towards helping his or her family to access better schooling and
healthcare.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we already have the right partnerships in place
to succeed. </p>
<p>

CaribShare Biogas is a social enterprise and registered charity in Jamaica
turning organic waste from hotels and small pig farms into biogas (type of biofuel)
and fertilizer.  The biogas is used to
produce clean electricity.  And, through
our “Waste
to Cash” program, up to 50% of our surplus revenues are shared with our
participating farmers to provide meaningful income.  In this way, we are helping to solve the
challenges of renewable energy, climate change, and rural poverty in Jamaica and the Caribbean.
Our Solution







From winning the Inter-American Development Bank’s 2012 IDEAS
Energy Innovation Contest and receiving funding assistance from the Development Bank of Jamaica, we have enough monies to cover 85%
of the cost of constructing our biogas plant. 
We have also received financial advisory services from membership with the
Branson Center for Entrepreneurship – Caribbean.  And, we need your help to the raise the remaining
US $20K so we can start operating in Dec 2015. 

The pilot digester that we are currently constructing in
Montego Bay will be the first biogas plant in Jamaica to produce electricity on
a sustained basis.  It will process over
1,400 tons of organic waste annually from the Sandals, Iberostar, Half Moon,
and RIU resorts, as well as over 50 small pig farms from seven communities in
Northern Trelawny – Stewart Town, Jackson Town, Clarks Town, Duncans, Marta
Brae, Stewart Castle, Bounty Hall.  Organic
waste collected includes kitchen scraps, left over buffet food, spoilt food,
cooking oils, and pig poo.
By participating in our “Waste to Cash” program, a farmer
with 50 pigs on average should earn initially at least US$1000 per year which will go a
great way towards helping his or her family to access better schooling and
healthcare.
Fortunately, we already have the right partnerships in place
to succeed. 


Our agreement with our biogas customer and energy
beneficiary ensures our financial sustainability.  Hear from them.

And, from your hotel beneficiaries.



Everyone who donates at least $20 is invited to tour our
biogas facility.  For greater
contributions, you will also have the chance to win monies towards airfare to
Jamaica.  We want you to come and share
our excitement in creating our unique waste recycling program.
We will be recycling and diverting tremendous quantities of
organic waste from landfills to produce clean energy, and are thrilled about

</div></div>","Coral reefs are the rainforests of the ocean, and many of the world's fish species rely on them as breeding grounds, nurseries, and shelter.
This winter, record ocean warming associated with a major El Niño event is driving widespread coral bleaching, but so far those effects have gone largely undocumented. We need your help to gather data and samples that will help us understand how coral reefs will evolve under continued climate change.
Ocean temperatures have warmed by as much as 8F in the central tropical Pacific Ocean, making this area ground zero for coral bleaching and mortality that is going on right now. In fact, when we visited our research site in November, we saw that up to 90% of the corals were already bleached, some coral species were entirely wiped out.    An urgent mission to the middle of the Pacific My name is Dr. Kim Cobb, and I'm a climate scientist at Georgia Tech. In March, my collaborator Dr. Julia Baum and I will lead an ambitious field expedition back to Christmas Island, joined by some of the world's experts on coral ecology and climate change. We will make detailed surveys of the island's reefs via SCUBA, collect small samples of tissues from any surviving corals for genetic analysis, and install a number of environmental sensors on the reef to monitor ocean temperature, salinity, and pH.

<h3>Letters from Earth<br/>
</h3>
<h3></h3>
<p><b><em>Letters from Earth</em> is a 
poetic journalism project, part travelogue, part documentary, an 
exploration of the impacts of environmental injustice on our land and
 our bodies. </b></p>
<p>Starting in early 2016, I'll be traveling around the country in my tiny house on wheels, specially designed to be non-toxic, accessible and semi-sustainable, visiting the individuals, front line communities, and wild habitats most affected by our extract-and-consume economy, and writing and recording my most powerful poetic prose to tell their stories and my own.  <br/></p>
<p>I want to inspire people to understand and act on both the urgency and the potential of this moment.     <br/></p>
<p>Environmental injustice falls most heavily on people who are already facing multiple kinds of injustice in their lives, so <i>Letters from Earth</i> will center their lives, their bodies, their stories, and their leadership.  <br/></p>
<p>My audio blogs will be broadcast nationally on Flashpoints, on listener sponsored Pacifica radio.   Text versions will also be posted on my website, and I will post calls to action for each edition of <i>Letters from Earth</i>, as well as links to further information. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Who I am  </h3>
<p>My name is Aurora Levins Morales.  I'm an internationally 
known, disabled and chronically ill Puerto Rican Jewish feminist writer,
 and I've been an activist artist all my life.  People tell me that my 
poetry and essays have given them courage and strength, hope and a 
sense of possibility.  People who heard me speak 25 years ago still write
 to me to tell me how their lives were changed.  
</p>
<p> I am a survivor of both ecological and sexual violence. As a 
child, I was exposed to dangerous pesticides and pollutants, and to the 
international trade in child pornography.  My body has suffered from these 
assaults, and I live with disability, chronic pain, exhaustion, and 
severe chemical sensitivity as a result. My body is full of stories that
 also express the trouble of the world.  
</p>
<p>I have been writing since I was a child.  I've read and spoken and 
hundreds of colleges and universities, my work appears in dozens of 
anthologies in more than seven languages, and I'm the author of <i>Medicine Stories, Remedios: Stories of Earth and Iron from the History of Puertorriqueñas, Kindling: Writings On the Body,</i> and co-author, with my mother Rosario Morales, of <i>Getting Home Alive</i> and <i>Cosecha and Other Stories.  </i>I have collaborated with the Bay Area based disabled artists performance project <i>Sins Invalid</i> since 2008.  

</p>
<p>I feel called to respond to our ecological crisis by doing what I do 
best: bringing the tools of activist art to the task of changing the 
world.  To tell stories that bridge the gap between body and landscape, 
the personal and the global and inspire people to take action on behalf 
of the people they love and the planet that is our home. <br/></p>
<p>I would love to have you with me on this journey. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why poetry?  Why radio? </h3>By itself, information
doesn’t often change people’s minds.  We’re too well defended against it.  It’s like a nutrient our bodies can’t absorb.  Poetry can be a kind of
co-factor that carries information into the heart and lets us feel our connection to it.  The imagery, emotion, metaphor and cadences of poetic prose are my most trusted tools with which to educate, agitate, move, and inspire the people around me.  <br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I love radio. I love its intimacy and its range.  I love how it makes us
 listen.  I grew up hearing broadcasts from around the world on 
shortwave radio, and co-produced a feminist radio show in my teens.  In 
the days after 9/11 I wrote a long poem that was broadcast on 
Flashpoints.  Response was overwhelming, and I began working as a Poet On
 Assignment, writing weekly poetic commentaries on the news.  My poet-journalist pieces continue to be broadcast, and always get a great response. <br/></p>
<p>So now I've decided to use the combined power of poetry and radio to take on this crisis of our biosphere and its human societies. <br/></p>

</div> <div> <h3>Why a tiny house on wheels?  <br/>
</h3>
<p>I was born on a coffee farm in Puerto Rico in the mid-1950s, and was exposed to  dangerous pesticides as a very young child.   My body is genetically challenged at getting rid of toxins, so I became sick.  I had seizures and migraines, and multiple head injuries from falls, and over time my body started reacting to all kinds of common substances, including construction materials, petroleum products, household cleaning supplies, and personal care products.  <br/></p>
<p>I could no longer ride buses, stay at hotels, or go to other people's homes, and I felt sick all the time.  I had become environmentally ill.  I spent a lot of time and money modifying my apartment to be a safe haven, and then, when my neighbors began spraying pesticides and venting laundry near my door, I became homeless and had to start over.  I realized then that the only way for me to have and keep a chemically safe home was to put it on wheels, so I had the freedom to leave when my location became toxic. <br/></p>
<p>I began consulting experts in tiny houses, non-toxic materials, renewable energy, EMF fields, universal design and accessible technology, and have spent the last five years designing and starting to build a prototype non-toxic mobile house.  It's a model of chemically accessibility, and
an expression of a big vision in which access and sustainability are
one.<span>  I call it the Vehicle for Change.</span></p>
<p>The frame, subfloor and walls are all aluminum to avoid plywood adhesives and mold.  It's superinsulated, has hardwood and ceramic tile floors and counters, is heated with a super-efficient, smokeless Kimberly wood stove, has water and air filters, a composting toilet, a solar cooker, natural fiber furnishings, and a solar powered electrical system.   <br/></p>
<p>The Vehicle is part of the story I am telling:  How the contamination of our environment is a disability issue, a housing issue, and a public health issue.  How we need to find ways to survive and adapt while we work for deeper change. And that begins with our bodies and our homes. <br/></p> <h3>Fundraising Phases One, Two and Three<br/>
</h3> <p>In order to do the work I am setting out to do, I must finish building and furnishing my Vehicle, install my solar array and battery bank to allow me to live and work anywhere, set up my studio so I can write, record and access the internet, and buy a truck to pull the Vehicle. <br/></p>
<p><b>Phase One</b><br/></p>
<p>During the first phase of this project I raised $125,000 through individual donors, crowdfunding and interest free loans.  I was able to buy and insulate my custom trailer shell, pay for electrical and plumbing work, the interior walls, ceiling and floor, buy the Kimberly stove, PurEffect advanced water filtration system, custom storage units, and a ton of building materials.<br/></p>
<p><b>Phase Two</b></p>
<p>This campaign will pay the balance I owe to my wonderful building crew, Community Builders Cooperative, my architect, electrician and plumber.  <br/></p>
<p><b>Phase Three</b> <br/></p>
<p>The last stage includes my solar power system, a 3/4 ton ""clean diesel"" truck, the innovative Automatic Safety Hitch, and RV driver training. <br/></p>
<p>Any funds over the $40,000 goal of this campaign will go to Phase Three.</p>We're actively seeking <b>in-kind donations</b> to lower the amount of cash I must raise, and <b>interest free loans</b> to give me more time to raise it.  <br/> </div><div>
<h3></h3>
<p>
</p>
<h3>The Perks!</h3>Honestly, I believe the biggest perk of this campaign for you and for me, is that you'll become part of my team, and we'll be doing this work together.  I'll  take you with me to the mountains where I was born in western Puerto Rico, and the birthplace of the Dupont Corporation, by the polluted Delaware River; to Louisiana's Gulf coast and notorious Cancer Alley, to the shale fields of North Dakota and the shorelines of the endangered Great Lakes, and into all the homes and meeting halls, forests and deserts I hope to visit.  When I am able to reach, inspire or connect people, you'll be a part of that.<br/><br/>But I have swag, too. <br/>There are copies of my books, original digital art prints, special pencils, and a CD of my poetry, and other special perks along the way.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1451314880/g3gs9xnqgjyoj9iscd5x.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>I'm also launching two special clubs, with early bird discounts.   <br/><br/>Book Club members will get my in depth recommendations of 3 books per season (12  a year) and access to a closed discussion forum where you can join me to talk about them. <br/><br/>Audio Club members will get recordings from my journey--back stories about my reports, musings about tiny house living and the writing life,  more about the people and places I encounter, and the sounds of nature.  <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1451314929/or3ps3cq2grxnkst1bof.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>Donors over $250 will have their names inscribed on special ""gratitude panels"" on the outside of my Vehicle, for all the world to see.  At the $1000 level you can pick a topic for me to research and write about for my Letters from Earth broadcasts.  (Yes, a group of you can pool your resources to get your issue on my agenda.) At $2500, I create a work of digital art about a topic you choose.  At $3500 you'll have bought me a battery, and you get to design your own square foot in my battery bay door mural ""I Get A Charge Out of You.""  $5000 donors can choose a destination for me to visit in person, to research, photograph and write about in detail.  <br/><br/><h3>The Impact<br/>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>By writing about bodies and landscape together, Letters from Earth brings together environmental, disability justice, health, women's liberation, and human rights activism, expanding our understanding of accessibility, sustainability, and public health.<br/>
</li>
<li>Through activist art about environmental justice, I'll reach and engage new audiences, and give them ways to take action on the issues I profile. <br/>
</li>
<li>My writing will connect people who don't yet know about each others work, and create links between activists in different movements.</li>
<li>I'll bring national attention to many local environmental struggles through personal, poetic stories that will move people.</li>
<li>I'll provide action and information links with each broadcast, giving listeners a concrete way to respond, and build broader support for local campaigns and projects. <br/>
</li>
<li>You can become an interest free lender through The Working World <br/>
</li>
</ul>I believe storytelling has the power to
restore connection and change how people think.<span> 
That transformation begins with imagination and hope, and this is the work
of poets.  I believe in the power of
conversation, within and between communities, of people listening to each
other.  That imagination, hope and
connection can bind us together into something new. Into molecules of change.  I’m asking you to help me do my part. </span>
<br/><p></p> <br/>
</div> <div>
<h3>Challenges</h3> <ul>
<li>Urgency!  It's costing my family more than we can afford to maintain the family home where I'm staying.  I need to get moved into my Vehicle and out on the road as soon as possible.  We also need to sell our land in Marlboro, Vermont to cover our expenses. <br/>
</li>
<li>Building a custom, chemically safe tiny house on wheels is a really big and difficult job. I've had to research every single aspect of its design at length, testing and discarding a lot of materials and design options.  Many of the materials, components, and procedures I've chosen are newly developed or just unfamiliar to builders.  This makes it hard for them to price supplies or accurately estimate labor costs.  It's an unusual project, and it's been hard to find construction professionals who are willing to take on the challenge. <br/>
</li>
<li>The rules about where you can park an RV and for how long vary tremendously from place to place, so planning my itinerary requires a lot of research and local help, and I'll need to pay a staff person to coordinate that effort. <br/>
</li>
<li>As a chronically ill person, my energy is unreliable.  Because my needs are complex and constantly changing, I need a diverse and flexible support team able to respond without overtaxing any one person.  <br/>
</li>
</ul> These are all big challenges, but I have a great community, and I'm a very resilient person.  I've already done a lot of amazing things that seemed impossible, including learning to walk again after a stroke--in Cuba!  I'll keep updating you about how I'm resolving these issues throughout the campaign. <br/><p> <br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>There are many ways to be part of this project besides donating money.  <b>CONTACT US DIRECTLY FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT ANY OF THESE OPTIONS. </b><br/></p>
<ul>
<li>One of the main ones is to SPREAD THE WORD! Use the IndieGoGo share button to tell your friends and networks about Letters from Earth and the Vehicle for Change. <br/>
</li>
<li>Join my team as a <b>Troubadour </b>and commit to sending out messages to your networks every few days throughout the campaign.  We'll provide the content.  All you have to do is share it. <b>LET US KNOW AND WE'LL SIGN YOU UP. </b><br/>
</li>
<li>Get your business or organization to become a <b>Sponsor</b> by donating cash, goods or services that I need. They'll get their logo on my Vehicle and a lot of exposure. <b>You can ask for us, or give us the contacts and we'll make the pitch.</b><br/>
</li>
<li>Join my <b>Lender</b> team and make me a long term interest free loan through The Working World.  We're seeking loans of $5000 or more as an alternative to a short term truck loan from a dealer or bank. <br/>
</li>
<li>Join my <b>Ground Team</b> and help find me places where I can park. <br/>
</li>
<li>
Connect me with people, organizations and issues I should know about. <br/>
</li>
<li>Once I start broadcasting, tell everyone you know to listen to Letters from Earth.</li>
<li>Do you know anyone who might want to buy our family's land in Marlboro, Vermont? It's 20 lovely acres of wooded land with a spring and studio cabin, in a beautiful, progressive and culturally rich area.  Contact me for more information. <br/>
</li>

Starting in early 2016, I'll be traveling around the country in my tiny house on wheels, specially designed to be non-toxic, accessible and semi-sustainable, visiting the individuals, front line communities, and wild habitats most affected by our extract-and-consume economy, and writing and recording my most powerful poetic prose to tell their stories and my own.  
I want to inspire people to understand and act on both the urgency and the potential of this moment.     
Environmental injustice falls most heavily on people who are already facing multiple kinds of injustice in their lives, so Letters from Earth will center their lives, their bodies, their stories, and their leadership.  
My audio blogs will be broadcast nationally on Flashpoints, on listener sponsored Pacifica radio.   Text versions will also be posted on my website, and I will post calls to action for each edition of Letters from Earth, as well as links to further information. 


Who I am  
My name is Aurora Levins Morales.  I'm an internationally 
known, disabled and chronically ill Puerto Rican Jewish feminist writer,
 and I've been an activist artist all my life.  People tell me that my 
poetry and essays have given them courage and strength, hope and a 
sense of possibility.  People who heard me speak 25 years ago still write
 to me to tell me how their lives were changed.  

 I am a survivor of both ecological and sexual violence. As a 
child, I was exposed to dangerous pesticides and pollutants, and to the 
international trade in child pornography.  My body has suffered from these 
assaults, and I live with disability, chronic pain, exhaustion, and 
severe chemical sensitivity as a result. My body is full of stories that
 also express the trouble of the world.  

I have been writing since I was a child.  I've read and spoken and 
hundreds of colleges and universities, my work appears in dozens of 
anthologies in more than seven languages, and I'm the author of Medicine Stories, Remedios: Stories of Earth and Iron from the History of Puertorriqueñas, Kindling: Writings On the Body, and co-author, with my mother Rosario Morales, of Getting Home Alive and Cosecha and Other Stories.  I have collaborated with the Bay Area based disabled artists performance project Sins Invalid since 2008.  


I feel called to respond to our ecological crisis by doing what I do 
best: bringing the tools of activist art to the task of changing the 
world.  To tell stories that bridge the gap between body and landscape, 
the personal and the global and inspire people to take action on behalf 
of the people they love and the planet that is our home. 
I would love to have you with me on this journey. 


Why poetry?  Why radio? By itself, information
doesn’t often change people’s minds.  We’re too well defended against it.  It’s like a nutrient our bodies can’t absorb.  Poetry can be a kind of
co-factor that carries information into the heart and lets us feel our connection to it.  The imagery, emotion, metaphor and cadences of poetic prose are my most trusted tools with which to educate, agitate, move, and inspire the people around me.  

I love radio. I love its intimacy and its range.  I love how it makes us
 listen.  I grew up hearing broadcasts from around the world on 
shortwave radio, and co-produced a feminist radio show in my teens.  In 
the days after 9/11 I wrote a long poem that was broadcast on 
Flashpoints.  Response was overwhelming, and I began working as a Poet On
 Assignment, writing weekly poetic commentaries on the news.  My poet-journalist pieces continue to be broadcast, and always get a great response. 
So now I've decided to use the combined power of poetry and radio to take on this crisis of our biosphere and its human societies.   
 
  Why a tiny house on wheels?  

I was born on a coffee farm in Puerto Rico in the mid-1950s, and was exposed to  dangerous pesticides as a very young child.   My body is genetically challenged at getting rid of toxins, so I became sick.  I had seizures and migraines, and multiple head injuries from falls, and over time my body started reacting to all kinds of common substances, including construction materials, petroleum products, household cleaning supplies, and personal care products.  
I could no longer ride buses, stay at hotels, or go to other people's homes, and I felt sick all the time.  I had become environmentally ill.  I spent a lot of time and money modifying my apartment to be a safe haven, and then, when my neighbors began spraying pesticides and venting laundry near my door, I became homeless and had to start over.  I realized then that the only way for me to have and keep a chemically safe home was to put it on wheels, so I had the freedom to leave when my location became toxic. 
I began consulting experts in tiny houses, non-toxic materials, renewable energy, EMF fields, universal design and accessible technology, and have spent the last five years designing and starting to build a prototype non-toxic mobile house.  It's a model of chemically accessibility, and
an expression of a big vision in which access and sustainability are
one.  I call it the Vehicle for Change.
The frame, subfloor and walls are all aluminum to avoid plywood adhesives and mold.  It's superinsulated, has hardwood and ceramic tile floors and counters, is heated with a super-efficient, smokeless Kimberly wood stove, has water and air filters, a composting toilet, a solar cooker, natural fiber furnishings, and a solar powered electrical system.   
The Vehicle is part of the story I am telling:  How the contamination of our environment is a disability issue, a housing issue, and a public health issue.  How we need to find ways to survive and adapt while we work for deeper change. And that begins with our bodies and our homes.  Fundraising Phases One, Two and Three
 In order to do the work I am setting out to do, I must finish building and furnishing my Vehicle, install my solar array and battery bank to allow me to live and work anywhere, set up my studio so I can write, record and access the internet, and buy a truck to pull the Vehicle. 
Phase One
During the first phase of this project I raised $125,000 through individual donors, crowdfunding and interest free loans.  I was able to buy and insulate my custom trailer shell, pay for electrical and plumbing work, the interior walls, ceiling and floor, buy the Kimberly stove, PurEffect advanced water filtration system, custom storage units, and a ton of building materials.
Phase Two
This campaign will pay the balance I owe to my wonderful building crew, Community Builders Cooperative, my architect, electrician and plumber.  
Phase Three 
The last stage includes my solar power system, a 3/4 ton ""clean diesel"" truck, the innovative Automatic Safety Hitch, and RV driver training. 
Any funds over the $40,000 goal of this campaign will go to Phase Three.We're actively seeking in-kind donations to lower the amount of cash I must raise, and interest free loans to give me more time to raise it.   



The Perks!Honestly, I believe the biggest perk of this campaign for you and for me, is that you'll become part of my team, and we'll be doing this work together.  I'll  take you with me to the mountains where I was born in western Puerto Rico, and the birthplace of the Dupont Corporation, by the polluted Delaware River; to Louisiana's Gulf coast and notorious Cancer Alley, to the shale fields of North Dakota and the shorelines of the endangered Great Lakes, and into all the homes and meeting halls, forests and deserts I hope to visit.  When I am able to reach, inspire or connect people, you'll be a part of that.But I have swag, too. There are copies of my books, original digital art prints, special pencils, and a CD of my poetry, and other special perks along the way.I'm also launching two special clubs, with early bird discounts.   Book Club members will get my in depth recommendations of 3 books per season (12  a year) and access to a closed discussion forum where you can join me to talk about them. Audio Club members will get recordings from my journey--back stories about my reports, musings about tiny house living and the writing life,  more about the people and places I encounter, and the sounds of nature.  
Donors over $250 will have their names inscribed on special ""gratitude panels"" on the outside of my Vehicle, for all the world to see.  At the $1000 level you can pick a topic for me to research and write about for my Letters from Earth broadcasts.  (Yes, a group of you can pool your resources to get your issue on my agenda.) At $2500, I create a work of digital art about a topic you choose.  At $3500 you'll have bought me a battery, and you get to design your own square foot in my battery bay door mural ""I Get A Charge Out of You.""  $5000 donors can choose a destination for me to visit in person, to research, photograph and write about in detail.  The Impact


By writing about bodies and landscape together, Letters from Earth brings together environmental, disability justice, health, women's liberation, and human rights activism, expanding our understanding of accessibility, sustainability, and public health.

Through activist art about environmental justice, I'll reach and engage new audiences, and give them ways to take action on the issues I profile. 

My writing will connect people who don't yet know about each others work, and create links between activists in different movements.
I'll bring national attention to many local environmental struggles through personal, poetic stories that will move people.
I'll provide action and information links with each broadcast, giving listeners a concrete way to respond, and build broader support for local campaigns and projects. 

You can become an interest free lender through The Working World 

I believe storytelling has the power to
restore connection and change how people think. 
That transformation begins with imagination and hope, and this is the work
of poets.  I believe in the power of
conversation, within and between communities, of people listening to each
other.  That imagination, hope and
connection can bind us together into something new. Into molecules of change.  I’m asking you to help me do my part. 
 
 
Challenges 
Urgency!  It's costing my family more than we can afford to maintain the family home where I'm staying.  I need to get moved into my Vehicle and out on the road as soon as possible.  We also need to sell our land in Marlboro, Vermont to cover our expenses. 

Building a custom, chemically safe tiny house on wheels is a really big and difficult job. I've had to research every single aspect of its design at length, testing and discarding a lot of materials and design options.  Many of the materials, components, and procedures I've chosen are newly developed or just unfamiliar to builders.  This makes it hard for them to price supplies or accurately estimate labor costs.  It's an unusual project, and it's been hard to find construction professionals who are willing to take on the challenge. 

The rules about where you can park an RV and for how long vary tremendously from place to place, so planning my itinerary requires a lot of research and local help, and I'll need to pay a staff person to coordinate that effort. 

As a chronically ill person, my energy is unreliable.  Because my needs are complex and constantly changing, I need a diverse and flexible support team able to respond without overtaxing any one person.  

 These are all big challenges, but I have a great community, and I'm a very resilient person.  I've already done a lot of amazing things that seemed impossible, including learning to walk again after a stroke--in Cuba!  I'll keep updating you about how I'm resolving these issues throughout the campaign.  
    Other Ways You Can Help There are many ways to be part of this project besides donating money.  CONTACT US DIRECTLY FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT ANY OF THESE OPTIONS. 

One of the main ones is to SPREAD THE WORD! Use the IndieGoGo share button to tell your friends and networks about Letters from Earth and the Vehicle for Change. 

Join my team as a Troubadour and commit to sending out messages to your networks every few days throughout the campaign.  We'll provide the content.  All you have to do is share it. LET US KNOW AND WE'LL SIGN YOU UP. 

Get your business or organization to become a Sponsor by donating cash, goods or services that I need. They'll get their logo on my Vehicle and a lot of exposure. You can ask for us, or give us the contacts and we'll make the pitch.

Join my Lender team and make me a long term interest free loan through The Working World.  We're seeking loans of $5000 or more as an alternative to a short term truck loan from a dealer or bank. 

Join my Ground Team and help find me places where I can park. 


Connect me with people, organizations and issues I should know about. 

Once I start broadcasting, tell everyone you know to listen to Letters from Earth.
Do you know anyone who might want to buy our family's land in Marlboro, Vermont? It's 20 lovely acres of wooded land with a spring and studio cabin, in a beautiful, progressive and culturally rich area.  Contact me for more information.",3.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<p><b>  Design Statement</b></p>
<p> “I na nye yiri” : You will have a house</p>
<p>Houses are
always born in a specific culture, of which they are a natural emanation.</p>
<p>In Ghana,
since the most ancient of times, the greatest blessing the ancestor's spirits

<p>The need

<p>The design
tries to answer to the Gahanian people request of having a comfortable house
which could look at a sustainable future with a regard for the tradition.</p>
<p>The idea
that is behind the project is to create a house with mud a material considered
poor that instead is rich of potential, from the ecological point of view, the
economical  and aesthetical ones. </p>
<p>The mud is
a traditional construction material of Ghana, and for a long time it has been the
material that has characterized  the Ghanaian
landscape. But now day the new growing middle class considered this material as
something underprivileged, something to avoid.</p>
<p>So  cities as Kumasi are growing in a chaotic and
concreted way, the landscape it's losing its feature.  and that's mean for the Gahanian people not
just to lose a tradition but also an opportunity to transform and took the
advantages of this tradition.</p>
<p>So our
challenge is to take part to the Nka project to change this process of gray
urban development.</p>
<p><b>- How did the project come about?</b></p>
<p>The
project is the result of our partecipation to a design competition organised by
NKA Foundation in 2014 to 'reinvent the african mud house'. Our design has been
selected to be built. Following this NKA offered us the opportunity to
collaborate with them and build our design through a 12 week building workshop
in Abetenim village, that will start in June 2016.</p>
<p>They
are able to cover part of project costs however it is down to us to raise the
rest of the money to fund the build. As architecture students  we are extremely fortunate and excited to
have the opportunity to design and manage a live project at this stage of our
career, however if we do not manage to raise the money the project may not
happen! Any contribution it's precious for us!</p>
<p><b>- Who is Nka Foundation?</b></p>
<p>NKA
Foundation is a registered nonprofit international organisation that exist to

focusing in human capital development.</p>
<p> They are developing an Arts village in
Abetenim which will provide a stable place for creative local people to work,
live, learn and share. A place for experimentation in art and architecture
looking for a sustainable development of the Gahanian society. For more

<p><b>- Who is the project benefitting? </b></p>
<p>As well as
the project being an extremely exciting opportunity for us personally, it is a
cause that is definitely worthwhile supporting. The living conditions in many
of the low income villages of the Ashanti region are extremely poor due to
inadequate construction and water damage. This has initiated a local stereotype
around mud construction in the region, and a dependence on expensive imported
resources for construction which many of the communities cannot afford. The
prototype is an opportunity to challenge the stigma surrounding mud
architecture and hopes to create an open source design that can be adopted
locally and expanded to enable a future of environmentally sustainable and
affordable homes.</p>

Houses are

</div></div>","Climate Change At The Equator
 The problem with Climate Change is that it is intangible. You can not see, smell or taste carbon. So how can humanity be inspired to act on something that is only evident once the damage is already done?

To begin, we've traveled to a place where the damage is not only unexpected, it is so far advanced that it's rapidly changing the landscape and the living conditions: the equator.
There are 25 mountains on the equator with glaciers. In 25 years, due largely to the effects of human-induced climate change these glaciers will have disappeared forever. 25 mountains. Zero latitude. 25 years. Zero ice. 25zero.


25zero 


The 25zero expedition aims to inspire meaningful action on Climate Change on a global and a local scale. 
Expedition leader Tim Jarvis is a world-renowned adventurer and environmental scientist. The 25zero teams will climb 6 of the #25zero mountains during COP21.
Tim and his core support team will personally climb 3 of these mountains: Carstensz Pyramid in Asia, Mount Stanley in Africa’s Rwenzori Mountains and Chimborazo in South America. Along the way, they will record footage of the devastating effects that Climate Change is having at the equator, and send it directly to the leaders meeting in Paris for COP21 and to global media outlets powerfully highlighting the urgency of the issue.




What is COP21?

COP21 is the annual 'Conference Of The Parties'. 
Every year the countries that want to take action for the climate meet with the aim to achieve a legally binding and universal agreement.
The aim for Paris, 2015 is to keep global warming below 2°C. 
In the 20 years of meetings prior, the global leaders have not reached a significant outcome. It must be different this year.



The Impact

Glaciers are an integral part of life on the equator. Tim and his crew will summit mountains in Indonesia, Africa and South America during #COP21. Glaciers atop Carstensz Pyramid in Indonesia are disappearing at a rate of around 7m of thickness per year and aren't expected to be there after 2015. 








In Africa, the Rwenzori Range, that is the source of the Nile river, has decreased in size by 80% in the last century. In the next 25 years, the glaciers will no longer exist.




In Ecuador, the locals mine the glacial ice from Chimborazo to sell at local markets. In 25 years, and potentially even before then, they won't be able to do that, because of the effects that human induced Climate Change will have had on equatorial glaciers.



How You Can Make A ChangeIn the past, simply talking about Climate Change and asking your local Government members for policy and action would be seen as enough.
Now, that's bare minimum. Talking is important, but action is imperative. By donating to #25zero, you'll be helping us capture footage of these unique glacial environments before they disappear and to record the stories of the people, plants and animals that rely on them for their survival .
Each of the perks offer something in return, from a simple thanks, to a t-shirt and even the piece of mind that your donation is getting at least one image from the mountain to the masses. But it isn't about what you receive in return. After all, by helping combat Climate Change now, you're giving the greatest gift of all; a sustainable planet for future generations. And that's the most important perk of all.

Climb With Tim And The Crew




You don't need to travel to Indonesia to climb the mountain; you can do it from home with the #25zero 'virtual climb' App. 
The App empowers you to share the experience of climbing the 25zero mountains with Tim and his teams. Footage, including images, videos and voice logs, will be captured periodically by the climbers, relayed and embedded into the app so you can experience it at the same time.
The App also enables you to choose the difficulty level of the mountain you want to climb. You can undertake your own personal challenge or race friends & colleagues to the summit. Reaching key ‘event points’ on the mountain unlocks interesting stories, facts and footage about the mountains, the people, flora and fauna that live there and how climate change will affect them, and what can be done about it.

I see myself as a shaker, mover and change maker and for that matter, after i lost a best friend to the 3rd June 2015 majot flooding disaster that claim about 215 lives including Mike's, a best friend.... i decided it was finally time to stop the seasonal flooding incidents in my community by considering recycling as a solution to the waste hazards in my community and nation at large as CSIR investigative reports showed that such disaster would have been avoided if the limited  available drainage systems where not engulfed by waste.<br/></p><p>This campaign is important to me becuase the death of mike gave me a gift and an opportunity to tackle this problem from the grassroot instead of channeling my anger to the government and complaining. with you help as a contributor, we can reach out to thousands of the younger generation through education on waste management practices as well as introduce an on campus reycling project.<br/></p><p>I want to communities like mine in Accra and all over Ghana  from market place to even our beaches which as so enguled with plastic waste become clean and green again. I ebelive educating the younger generation(as Africa holds the highest number of young people than any other continent and that number will double by 2050) as they are the future .<br/></p><br/><br/><p>What We Need &amp; What You Get<br/></p><p>The coliba project seeks to raise fund to roll out a school project in 
25 community schools in Accra Ghana, namely James Town, lapaz and 
Omandjo Dwenwoho (community in Accra that has been cut off from waste 
collection services ). The fund is to enable the purchasing of logistics
 such as waste bins, gloves and tools used for general waste collection 
and clean up .<br/>1. 50 large  waste bins<br/>2. 1000 pieces of gloves and nose masks<br/>3.1000 pieces of waste bags<br/></p><p>4. community and on campus education and sensitisation reach out/campaign<br/></p><p><br/><br/>These
 logistics would go a long way to enable us educate students on good 
waste management and segregation practices as well as alternative use of
 waste. recyclable waste collected from the schools would be sorted and 
sold to the recycling companies. Revenues raised from sales will be used
 to sustain the projects in the schools as well as reach out to more 
community schools.<br/><br/>At the Community level, this project seeks to 
educate home owners and citizens at the community level in James Town, 
Lapaz and Omandjo Dwenwoho on the need of segregation as well as 
incentivise families and individuals who are able to segregate their 
waste for us through three(3) packages such as the Coliba cash where 
low-income families can raise money , coliba School where money raise 
per the kilos of waste submitted by parents would go into paying a 
child's fees and Coliba health for health insurance provisions to parents that cant afford them.<br/><br/>We seek to 
gather 2000 kilos(2tonnes) of waste monthly and make sales to the recycling 
companies to enable us pay home owners and suppliers as well as sustain 
the projects in community schools and other community projects like 
beach clean up aside the education and sensitisation workshops.<br/><br/><br/></p><p>The Impact<br/></p><p>This
 project will empower citizens; introduce community and on campus recycling project, satisfy the demand of recycling 
companies, generate revenue for owners and low-income families as well 
as protecting the environment for the benefit of all.  </p><p>This school and community reycling project would be successful becuase we have piloted a community project like this in Lapaz, where we currenlt encourage home owners as well as shop owners and market woment to properly store recyclable waste materials like plastics and bottles and bring them in return for cash.

Thank you!<br/></p><p><br/></p><br/><br/></div>","Short SummaryMy name is Prince Kwame Agbata and i live and reside in an urban local community called Omandjo Dwenwoho in Accra Ghana, a community cut away from basics amenities like access to good drinking water, drainage systems as well as waste management services.Over 70,000 youth graduate annually from a local university here in Accra Ghana, myself be one of them didnt want to join the unemployed rising number of youth in my country. I see myself as a shaker, mover and change maker and for that matter, after i lost a best friend to the 3rd June 2015 majot flooding disaster that claim about 215 lives including Mike's, a best friend.... i decided it was finally time to stop the seasonal flooding incidents in my community by considering recycling as a solution to the waste hazards in my community and nation at large as CSIR investigative reports showed that such disaster would have been avoided if the limited  available drainage systems where not engulfed by waste.This campaign is important to me becuase the death of mike gave me a gift and an opportunity to tackle this problem from the grassroot instead of channeling my anger to the government and complaining. with you help as a contributor, we can reach out to thousands of the younger generation through education on waste management practices as well as introduce an on campus reycling project.I want to communities like mine in Accra and all over Ghana  from market place to even our beaches which as so enguled with plastic waste become clean and green again. I ebelive educating the younger generation(as Africa holds the highest number of young people than any other continent and that number will double by 2050) as they are the future .What We Need & What You GetThe coliba project seeks to raise fund to roll out a school project in 
25 community schools in Accra Ghana, namely James Town, lapaz and 
Omandjo Dwenwoho (community in Accra that has been cut off from waste 
collection services ). The fund is to enable the purchasing of logistics
 such as waste bins, gloves and tools used for general waste collection 
and clean up .1. 50 large  waste bins2. 1000 pieces of gloves and nose masks3.1000 pieces of waste bags4. community and on campus education and sensitisation reach out/campaignThese
 logistics would go a long way to enable us educate students on good 
waste management and segregation practices as well as alternative use of
 waste. recyclable waste collected from the schools would be sorted and 
sold to the recycling companies. Revenues raised from sales will be used
 to sustain the projects in the schools as well as reach out to more 
community schools.At the Community level, this project seeks to 
educate home owners and citizens at the community level in James Town, 
Lapaz and Omandjo Dwenwoho on the need of segregation as well as 
incentivise families and individuals who are able to segregate their 
waste for us through three(3) packages such as the Coliba cash where 
low-income families can raise money , coliba School where money raise 
per the kilos of waste submitted by parents would go into paying a 
child's fees and Coliba health for health insurance provisions to parents that cant afford them.We seek to 
gather 2000 kilos(2tonnes) of waste monthly and make sales to the recycling 
companies to enable us pay home owners and suppliers as well as sustain 
the projects in community schools and other community projects like 
beach clean up aside the education and sensitisation workshops.The ImpactThis
 project will empower citizens; introduce community and on campus recycling project, satisfy the demand of recycling 
companies, generate revenue for owners and low-income families as well 
as protecting the environment for the benefit of all.  This school and community reycling project would be successful becuase we have piloted a community project like this in Lapaz, where we currenlt encourage home owners as well as shop owners and market woment to properly store recyclable waste materials like plastics and bottles and bring them in return for cash. We made this much more easier by providing them waste bags for them to do sorting of the waste they make. this number has risen to 42 community women supply waste to us instead of following the normal practices of dumping them in drainage systems as waste management company services are expensive for them.what else could be more exciting than keeping your waste sorted and be incentivised for them through recycling? Has this been done somewhere else and been successful?  Yes. Wecyclers.com in nigeria has made is happen and it can hold true here as well.I encourage you to support us even if you cant contribute by helping us reach out to every invidual soul there , change makers, young, old, friends and all those passionate to see change in the world, most of all environmental change.Help has share this campaign with with rest of your world and network.

<h3>Our Story<br/> </h3>
<p><br/>Welcome to HEMMER Services. We are new on the 'mercury recovery' scene, and so is our fresh and patented technology. However, we are not inexperienced. In fact, we have been recovering environmental mercury for over 20 years. When we realized that we could use our experience on a larger scale, to do our part to help the environment, we created The HEMMER (HEavy Metal and MERcury recovery). Through our activities, we aim to use the latest technologies in order to improve our local ecosystems. Our main purpose is to contract with local and state government across various sectors to cleanse and restore our rivers and reservoirs.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Mercury Facts</strong><br/><br/>Mercury (Hg) is an element that occurs in the environment naturally as a result of human activity. It is a silvery color and the only metal that is liquid at room temperature. It is considered one of the ""heavy metals"" because of its atomic weight and can be found as number '80' on the periodic table of elements. Mercury can also evaporate to form an odorless, colorless, vapor. Mercury has proved useful for measuring devices such as thermometers, but is toxic to humans and animals.<br/><br/>Research on a northern Wisconsin lake found that as little of one gram of mercury per year was enough to contaminate the lake's entire fish population. When mercury enters the water, it can combine with organic materials to form organic compounds such as methylmercury (MeHg), which is produced mainly by bacteria and is the form that poses the greatest risk to environmental exposure.<br/><br/>The process by which mercury contaminates fish is very complex. Simply put, tiny organisms absorb mercury. Small fish eat the tiny organisms; big fish eat the small fish and so goes the food chain heirarchy. By a process called biomagnification, mercury levels increase as they move up the food chain. Ultimately, mercury levels in humans are the greatest, as we are at the top of the food chain</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The HEMMER</strong><br/><br/>The HEMMER is the foundation and heart of aquatic restoration. Using proprietary technology, coupled with traditional methods, the HEMMER effectively recovers toxic liquid mercury from waterways in an efficient and safe manner. Cleansing our waters for fish and human consumption.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>Electromagnetic Field</strong><br/><br/>The HEMMER generates an intense electromagnetic field<br/>creating process known as photoionization and field ionization. This process separates electrons (charge separation) from molecules which 'ionizes' water. Once water has been ionized, it becomes a reliable conductor of electrical current. This creates ideal conditions to introduce electrical charge to objects within the aquatic environment, specifically liquid metal mercury.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Mercury Manipulation</strong><br/><br/>Once liquid mercury has gained an electrical charge, the<br/>mercury gains stronger surface tension, and can be 'pulled' towards an object with an opposing electrical charge.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>Amalgamate</strong><br/><br/>The HEMMER capitalizes greatly on the natural binding, also known as 'amalgamation', between mercury and gold, copper, and similar metals. The HEMMER has multiple surfaces coated with various mixtures that may include gold or copper. These surfaces are also carrying an opposing electrical charge opposite the polarity of the liquid metal mercury.</p>
<p>Using traditional methods, such as shaped riffles, in combination with the above mentioned techniques, the HEMMER effectively stops the forward progression of mercury almost instantly, including a specially designed collection container that uses gold plated slabs with a wide surface area, that is also electrically charged.</p>
<p>The HEMMER grabs hold of mercury, and refuses to let go!<br/><br/><strong>Our Campaign</strong></p>
<p>Even if we don't reach our goal, the funds you contribute will bring us closer to making this a reality. Every penny can be stretched and used wisely.

<p>We are now at the end of a long journey, and we need a shoulder to lean on to get us across that finish line. Not just any 'shoulder', but a community of 'shoulders'. Will you be our shoulder to lean on?</p>
<p>Unlike other campaigns, we are not building 'consumer' products. However, we can offer a special perk directly related to the project.

<h2>What its all about:</h2>
<p>Los Perros Urban Farming is a small scale market garden located in the city of Malmö in Sweden's South. It was started by us; Buddha Browett and Sofia Reuterving. Buddha is originally from Sydney, Australia and Sofia is from Ånge in the North of Sweden. We both moved to Barcelona in 2007 where we met and lived until 2012 when we decided to pack up and move to Malmö. Of course we brought Stretch with us, our adopted Catalan street dog (mascot and farm namesake), and we now call Malmö our home! Late last year our family grew with our little Cleo, the newest member of the team. </p>
<p>Los Perros Urban Farming was started in 2015 and we are now entering our 3rd year, making us one of Sweden's First<i> </i>commercial Urban Farms. For the past two seasons we have been farming on 1000m2 and this year we are now expanding to 2500m2. With Buddha's background as a chef we feel that we have the advantage of knowing how to use what we grow to its maximum capability, always sharing tips and tricks of how to use something that we raised from seed. We are firm believers in 'zero waste' and we strive to re-use and compost everything we can. We aim to inspire others to grow by showing that high quality produce can be grown anywhere, especially in an urban environment.</p>
<p>Since we started Los Perros Urban Farming, we have noticed a rising demand for locally grown, vegetables and flowers, grown under organic principles. That's why in 2017 we are expanding to 2500m2, which makes us (apparently) the largest commercial Urban Farm in Sweden. So far we have put everything we have into our farm, and to be able to continue with what we do, we now need your help. With the funds raised by this campaign we will be able to increase our volunteer program, run farm tours, work together with children's educational programs and create a smoother running Urban Farm that benefits the local community.</p>

<h2>So what's holding us back?</h2>
<p>The jump in land size from 1000m2 to 2500m2 means that we need to improve the way that we work and the tools that we use. In the past we have been using a very basic setup - only small hand tools, which means a lot of our time has been spent on tasks like hand weeding. With better tools our work will become more effective, which would make it possible for us to provide more fresh, organic vegetables to our local community and spend more time on our educational programs.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong><u>Weed Sheets:</u></strong>  To keep weed pressure down.</li>
<li>
<strong><u>Row Covers:</u></strong>  Which would help us to extend the seasons. Vital to our challenging climate.</li>
<li>With a <strong><u>2 Wheel BCS Tractor,</u></strong> we would save days of work spent on turning soil and making beds, saving us both lots of time and lots of muscle aches!</li>
<li>Being 'chemical free' means that we need to find creative ways to deter pests. An <strong><u>Insect Net</u></strong> would stop our crops from being eaten and damaged by a range of different insects, flies, bugs and even birds.</li>
<li>A <strong><u>Cargo Bike</u></strong> is the greenest way to deliver our vegetables, herbs and flowers. Appreciated by both the environment and our community.</li>

<h2>To Say Thank You For Donating: </h2>
<p>To show our appreciation for donating towards our farm, we would like to offer you something back. So with the help from some of Malmös best restaurants, cafes, meeting places, food critics, products, food/drinks and of course our very own farm we can offer you to get something back when you donate. </p>
<p>If you donate towards Los Perros Urban Farming you have the choice to, as a bonus, get one of our fantastic 'perks' (depending on how much you choose to donate) Maybe it's a cup of locally roasted coffee, your new favorite t-shirt or perhaps even dinner for two at one of Malmö's best restaurants. </p>
<p>The amount that you donate goes directly towards helping Los Perros Urban Farming to grow. (The 'Perks' offered are given as a 'Thank You' for the donation and therefore they do not reflect the financial value that they usually come at if you were to buy the product directly). </p>
<p>Of course you can also donate towards us without choosing a 'perk' and every euro counts.</p>

With a 2 Wheel BCS Tractor, we would save days of work spent on turning soil and making beds, saving us both lots of time and lots of muscle aches!
Being 'chemical free' means that we need to find creative ways to deter pests. An Insect Net would stop our crops from being eaten and damaged by a range of different insects, flies, bugs and even birds.
A Cargo Bike is the greenest way to deliver our vegetables, herbs and flowers. Appreciated by both the environment and our community.

 


 

 
To Say Thank You For Donating: 
To show our appreciation for donating towards our farm, we would like to offer you something back. So with the help from some of Malmös best restaurants, cafes, meeting places, food critics, products, food/drinks and of course our very own farm we can offer you to get something back when you donate. 
If you donate towards Los Perros Urban Farming you have the choice to, as a bonus, get one of our fantastic 'perks' (depending on how much you choose to donate) Maybe it's a cup of locally roasted coffee, your new favorite t-shirt or perhaps even dinner for two at one of Malmö's best restaurants. 
The amount that you donate goes directly towards helping Los Perros Urban Farming to grow. (The 'Perks' offered are given as a 'Thank You' for the donation and therefore they do not reflect the financial value that they usually come at if you were to buy the product directly). 
Of course you can also donate towards us without choosing a 'perk' and every euro counts.

<h3><strong>Aloha from the Big Island of Hawaii! I’m Tim Mann.</strong></h3>
<p>My wife Susanne and I, and our four children Victor, Jack, Lucky, and Rose, are building sailing fishing boats that will change the world and clean up our oceans. We're calling the first of these boats <i>Splash</i>, and this is The Splash Project. The purpose of the project is to build the first boat and demonstrate the viability of the concept to the world (WE know it works!).</p>
<h3>Here's what these boats will do, and why they are valuable to you and the rest of the world:</h3>
<p><strong>1. These boats catch fish but don't need diesel fuel to operate; they don't pollute our planet, and they don't increase global warming the way that current factory-fishing methods do. The wind they use is not only CLEAN, it's also FREE! They look like this:</strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507856612/bhlehxh5mblhmjlx01wa.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>2. The fishing methods we use eliminate the tragic waste of ""bycatch"", </strong>where as much as 6 pounds of fish and other marine life is killed by motorized fishing boats for each pound that lands on your table. Seals, dolphins, turtles, and non-targeted species of fish are routinely caught, killed, then dumped over the side. <strong>Here's what we'll be eliminating with our boats:</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507694235/dlrfewbkmlw8rtvajfpi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>3. The fishing methods we use</strong> also eliminate the destruction of marine habitat and life caused by net-fishing, especially factory trawling, which drags huge nets with steel cables and steel plates directly over the ocean floor. <strong>We will replace what you see below with sailboats that don't pollute, don't cause global warming, don't create bycatch, and don't waste our precious ocean resources:</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507693053/fk2irypotqj8s3pgixw6.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>4. Our boats run on wind, </strong>not diesel; and when the high cost of fuel is taken out of the cost of fish, your local ocean fish prices could go down to half what they are now. You might feel better about eating ocean fish if they cost half as much and came from a non-polluting fishing boat that didn't create any wasteful bycatch. <strong>That's a direct benefit for you.</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507695781/y3jgcjy55e6vi7qydiae.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>We're qualified and prepared to do this:</h3>
<p>I've built boats since I was 16, and designed and built my first sailing fishing boat, <strong><a href=""https://newageofsail.com/tropic-bird-56-foot-sailing-fishing-trimaran/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u>the 56-foot <i>Tropic Bird</i>,</u></a></strong> in 1978. I fished Tropic Bird commercially from 1979 to 1995 in Hawaii and the Marshall Islands, made good money fishing, and learned firsthand how viable the concept of sailing fishing boats was.</p>
<p>As a professional boatbuilder, I've built <strong><a href=""https://newageofsail.com/boats-weve-built/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u>many large boats</u></a></strong>. The whole family (Susanne, Victor, Jack Lucky, and Rose) has been working in the boat shop learning how to use the tools, the glues and fiberglass, and how to work in wood. We have our own boat shop. We have a local source of sustainable lumber in log form, and our own sawmill to saw it into boat-building lumber. We have boat shop equipment that includes a 3-ton forklift, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PozqdeEX5Ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u><strong>a 10-ton crane</strong></u></a>, and $60,000 worth of hand and shop tools.</p>
<h3>We need your help to do this:</h3>
<p><strong>They say it takes a village to raise a child; </strong>well, in Polynesia where we live, it takes a village to build a boat. Everyone’s involved, from the smallest child who fetches coconut fronds to shade the canoe from the sun, to the master canoe builder who prays among the trees in the forest for days before selecting the one to become the canoe.</p>
<p><strong>We’re the same. </strong>We may be experienced boat builders and blue water sailors, but we still need our village. Especially for this project; because it’s the most ambitious one we’ve ever undertaken. It’s truly the start of a blue-green revolution in the way we do things on the ocean! We’re not just making a new iPhone app or electronic gadget; we’re building a BOAT!</p>
<p><strong>That’s why we need your help.</strong> Funding this project will allow us to finish Splash as much as a year or two sooner than if funded her all ourselves. We'll build her anyway, it will just take us a lot longer without funding. We think this is important for the world to see as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Once we're fully funded, we'll have the boat in the water 9 months later. Just like a baby!</strong></p>
<ul></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Risks &amp; Challenges Of The Project</h3>
<ul>
<li>For you? Maybe having to wait a little longer than you'd like for your perk, if it's one of those that involve sailing on <i>Splash</i>. We <strong>do</strong> have to get her finished and in the water before we can take you sailing on her, take you on a surf charter, or teach you how to fish Hawaiian-style.</li>
<li>For us? That we don't get adequately funded, and have to fund Splash out of our own pockets. Big deal; it'll take us longer. But this puts off the positive change this boat could make in the world until some time in the future, and that would be a shame.</li>
<li>Other risks and challenges? Nothing I haven't successfully dealt with before on any of the 25-odd boats I've built over the last 45 years. And where in the past I've always built boats by myself, now I've got five solid and competent partners in my wife Susanne and my four children. We'll get her done in record time.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>The $65,000 we're asking to fund will purchase all the supplies, materials, hardware, and equipment for the first Splash: the lumber and plywood, the epoxy glue and fiberglass; the nails, screws, bolts, and other fasteners; the mast, turnbuckles, and rigging wire; all the line (what land people call ""rope""); the anchors and anchor chain; the refrigeration equipment for the fish hold; the batteries, electrical system and wiring; the radar, fish-finder, and VHF radio; and other things too numerous to list.</li>
<li>
<strong>We're contributing all the labor,</strong> the overhead, the insurance, the band-aids, the water cooler for the shop, and the wear and tear on all our shop tools. If we built this boat for a boat shop client, we'd charge them $150,000; so our contribution is worth $85,000; more than what we're asking for in funding.</li>
<li>
<strong>If we don't reach our entire goal</strong>, we'll just have to come up with the balance of funding needed by ourselves; and finishing the boat will take a little longer.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Our Awesome Perks For You:</h3>
<p><strong>Check them out;</strong> they range all the way from ""you get our sincere thanks"" (for ten bucks) on up to a week of sailing on Splash, with all meals cooked for you, craft wines and beers, and your own personal Hawaiian tour and lore guide; <strong>on up to owning 20% of the boat!</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute your green energy ($), you can still be a big help to the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href=""https://newageofsail.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Go to The Splash Project website</strong></a> and sign up for our free weekly newsletter in the right hand column; and get your friends signed up if the project interests them. Spreading the word about this opportunity is just as valuable as the funding is!</li>

1. These boats catch fish but don't need diesel fuel to operate; they don't pollute our planet, and they don't increase global warming the way that current factory-fishing methods do. The wind they use is not only CLEAN, it's also FREE! They look like this:
2. The fishing methods we use eliminate the tragic waste of ""bycatch"", where as much as 6 pounds of fish and other marine life is killed by motorized fishing boats for each pound that lands on your table. Seals, dolphins, turtles, and non-targeted species of fish are routinely caught, killed, then dumped over the side. Here's what we'll be eliminating with our boats:

3. The fishing methods we use also eliminate the destruction of marine habitat and life caused by net-fishing, especially factory trawling, which drags huge nets with steel cables and steel plates directly over the ocean floor. We will replace what you see below with sailboats that don't pollute, don't cause global warming, don't create bycatch, and don't waste our precious ocean resources:


4. Our boats run on wind, not diesel; and when the high cost of fuel is taken out of the cost of fish, your local ocean fish prices could go down to half what they are now. You might feel better about eating ocean fish if they cost half as much and came from a non-polluting fishing boat that didn't create any wasteful bycatch. That's a direct benefit for you.

We're qualified and prepared to do this:
I've built boats since I was 16, and designed and built my first sailing fishing boat, the 56-foot Tropic Bird, in 1978. I fished Tropic Bird commercially from 1979 to 1995 in Hawaii and the Marshall Islands, made good money fishing, and learned firsthand how viable the concept of sailing fishing boats was.
As a professional boatbuilder, I've built many large boats. The whole family (Susanne, Victor, Jack Lucky, and Rose) has been working in the boat shop learning how to use the tools, the glues and fiberglass, and how to work in wood. We have our own boat shop. We have a local source of sustainable lumber in log form, and our own sawmill to saw it into boat-building lumber. We have boat shop equipment that includes a 3-ton forklift, a 10-ton crane, and $60,000 worth of hand and shop tools.
We need your help to do this:
They say it takes a village to raise a child; well, in Polynesia where we live, it takes a village to build a boat. Everyone’s involved, from the smallest child who fetches coconut fronds to shade the canoe from the sun, to the master canoe builder who prays among the trees in the forest for days before selecting the one to become the canoe.
We’re the same. We may be experienced boat builders and blue water sailors, but we still need our village. Especially for this project; because it’s the most ambitious one we’ve ever undertaken. It’s truly the start of a blue-green revolution in the way we do things on the ocean! We’re not just making a new iPhone app or electronic gadget; we’re building a BOAT!
That’s why we need your help. Funding this project will allow us to finish Splash as much as a year or two sooner than if funded her all ourselves. We'll build her anyway, it will just take us a lot longer without funding. We think this is important for the world to see as soon as possible.
Once we're fully funded, we'll have the boat in the water 9 months later. Just like a baby!


The Risks & Challenges Of The Project

For you? Maybe having to wait a little longer than you'd like for your perk, if it's one of those that involve sailing on Splash. We do have to get her finished and in the water before we can take you sailing on her, take you on a surf charter, or teach you how to fish Hawaiian-style.
For us? That we don't get adequately funded, and have to fund Splash out of our own pockets. Big deal; it'll take us longer. But this puts off the positive change this boat could make in the world until some time in the future, and that would be a shame.
Other risks and challenges? Nothing I haven't successfully dealt with before on any of the 25-odd boats I've built over the last 45 years. And where in the past I've always built boats by myself, now I've got five solid and competent partners in my wife Susanne and my four children. We'll get her done in record time.

What We Need & What You Get

The $65,000 we're asking to fund will purchase all the supplies, materials, hardware, and equipment for the first Splash: the lumber and plywood, the epoxy glue and fiberglass; the nails, screws, bolts, and other fasteners; the mast, turnbuckles, and rigging wire; all the line (what land people call ""rope""); the anchors and anchor chain; the refrigeration equipment for the fish hold; the batteries, electrical system and wiring; the radar, fish-finder, and VHF radio; and other things too numerous to list.

We're contributing all the labor, the overhead, the insurance, the band-aids, the water cooler for the shop, and the wear and tear on all our shop tools. If we built this boat for a boat shop client, we'd charge them $150,000; so our contribution is worth $85,000; more than what we're asking for in funding.

If we don't reach our entire goal, we'll just have to come up with the balance of funding needed by ourselves; and finishing the boat will take a little longer.

Our Awesome Perks For You:
Check them out; they range all the way from ""you get our sincere thanks"" (for ten bucks) on up to a week of sailing on Splash, with all meals cooked for you, craft wines and beers, and your own personal Hawaiian tour and lore guide; on up to owning 20% of the boat!

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute your green energy ($), you can still be a big help to the project:


Go to The Splash Project website and sign up for our free weekly newsletter in the right hand column; and get your friends signed up if the project interests them. Spreading the word about this opportunity is just as valuable as the funding is!
Also please use the Indiegogo share tools!

<p>How times have changed.  A recent Fondazione ACRA survey has found that the average person living in Cambodia uses about ten times the number of plastic bags as their counterparts in China and Europe.   As a result, the Cambodian countryside is now awash in plastic.</p>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493511065/qhqvvahlmnlvagmq9ktj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Making the problem worse is the fact that rubbish removal is only available in the largest cities.  This leaves most rural Cambodians with no choice other than to burn their trash, which is largely made up of plastic.  Many Cambodians are unaware that plastic releases toxic gas when burned and allow their children to play among the smoldering rubbish.</p>

<p>Our latest and most exciting initiative is dealing directly with the problems of waste plastic and poverty in the Cambodian countryside.   Naga Earth is building small-scale plastic recycling machines that rural Cambodians can use to turn trash into useful products.   They will be simultaneously cleaning up the countryside and providing for their families.</p>
<p>The machines are inexpensive and Naga Earth will set up micro-finance programs that will make them affordable to the average Cambodian.  </p>
<p><strong>Plastic Heated Press </strong></p>

<p>Initially Naga Earth will set up a production and training area at our factory to build table umbrellas.   Then we will start marketing the umbrellas to our network of partners in the hospitality industry.   The stylish, recycled plastic umbrellas will be made from sustainably grown bamboo provided by <a href=""http://www.bambusaglobal.org/about-us.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bambusa Global Ventures</a>. </p>
<p>There is a strong market for this product in Cambodia: Umbrellas are used by all hotels and restaurants with outdoor areas to protect against the sun, and rain during monsoon season. Through our biodiesel project we work with businesses in the hospitality industry around Cambodia and have excellent insight into the environmental and social consciousness throughout the sector.

<p>We will work with our partner NGOs to identify Khmer families that would benefit from these machines and be able to provide for their families by operating the machines and building umbrellas.  We will help set up micro-financing for qualified individuals and provide free training to help them understand how to safely operate the machine.  We will also provide training to make sure the user understands how to make high-quality umbrellas.</p>

Why Naga Earth?
So who is Naga Earth and what makes us so qualified to initiate this project?  Well, we have been successfully running environmental projects in Cambodia for ten years.
Location 
As a volunteer based organization, we are in an amazing location that is quite desirable to live and work.  Our volunteers are a ten-minute bike ride from downtown Siem Reap and a ten-minute bike ride the other direction to the amazing Angkor Wat temple complex.

Factory
We have a large factory with plenty of open floor space

 
Volunteers 
Due to the desirability of our location and the quality of our projects we are able to attract a large number of very talented volunteers.  With almost everyone else in Siem Reap focused on tourism, engineers looking to volunteer find Naga Earth to be an interesting opportunity. 
We have an agreement with a technical university in France that consistently provides Naga Earth with interns who are working on their master’s degree in engineering and are looking for a quality work experience. 
We partner with Concert Cambodia who place volunteers with non-profits in Siem Reap.   Our website describes current volunteer opportunities.

Ahora, debido al cambio climático y la deforestación, los árboles han soltado la tierra, el río se ha sedimentado y el barco “Nueva Fidelidad” en el que navegaba este eterno amor ha quedado encallado, tal situación ha vuelto los días de la pareja rutinarios, pues a diferencia de cuando navegaban hoy no pueden disfrutar de la emocionante vida natural y cultural que florece en toda la geografía ribereña, tal monotonía está acabando con el amor por el cual Florentino Ariza esperó 53 años, 7 meses y 11 días con sus noches; cuanta razón tenía su tío León XII cuando le decía:“Sin navegación fluvial no hay amor” Es por ello que necesitamos de tu ayuda con el fin de reforestar la cuenca del río Magdalena para así retener la tierra, mejorar el hábitat de las especies y brindar un bello paisaje, lo que permitirá a la pareja de enamorados seguir navegando un río Magdalena que gracias a tu contribución volverá a ser el lugar de fantasía que algún día fue.Al contribuir con la siembra de árboles avivarás el amor de la pareja, que al igual que el tuyo crecerá  y se fortalecerá a medida que tú árbol crezca pues su fruto es precisamente: EL AMOR. 59.110 millones de arbolesGabriel García Márquez escribió en el año de 1981 para el diario El País de España “La rehabilitación del Magdalena solo será posible con el esfuerzo continuado e intenso de por lo menos cuatro generaciones conscientes: un siglo entero realizando la siembra técnica de 59.110 millones de árboles"", llamado que de haberse atendido en tal época estaríamos cumpliendo en estos momentos 36 años en labores de reforestación, un poco más de un tercio del siglo mencionado, por lo que es apremiante empezar dicha labor cuanto antes, no lo podemos seguir postergando, ninguna ayuda es poca puesto que con cualquiera de ellas sembraremos árboles y cada vez la meta será más alcanzable.Primer jornada de ""Siembra Amor"" con 300 árboles plantados, abril 29/2017 Además de ésto demostraremos que es posible desarrollar proyectos donde no solo se obtiene una rentabilidad económica, sino también una rentabilidad ambiental, cultural y social; ambiental por estar contribuyendo con la reforestación de la cuenca del río Magdalena, cultural por estar rindiendo un homenaje a la obra del Nobel, inspirada a su vez en la emocionante vida cultural que florece en la geografía ribereña, y social porque son las comunidades locales las que se beneficiarán de una actividad radicalmente opuesta a la que algunos aún realizan en éstos bosques tropicales, como es la deforestación. El río de la vida está muriendohttp://w.elespectador.com/noticias/temadeldia/salvar-el-magdalena-articulo-309609http://www.wwf.org.co/?261830/Navegar-o-no-navegar-los-dilemas-del-Magdalena Río Magdalena: El protagonistaEl río Magdalena, más que un simple escenario o telón de fondo, es un verdadero protagonista en la obra de Gabriel García Márquez, tal como lo fue en su vida, pues él mismo lo recorrió varias veces en su años de estudio, dichos viajes los describió como una maravillosa experiencia, a bordo de buques repletos de estudiantes con los cuales se sentaban a ver pasar la vida, aprendiendo de ella ""más y mejor"", por lo tanto, si el barco se retrasaba algunos días por un encallamiento u otra circunstancia, no había ningún inconveniente, pues la fiesta de la vida se prolongaba y los capitanes de la época te elaboraban y sellaban una justificada excusa por la demora. Cartas de amorSi bien recuerdas, Florentino Ariza se ha caracterizado por escribir alentadoras cartas de amor con un gran ""poder de deslumbramiento"", con las cuales ha ayudado a perpetuar la unión de abundantes parejas, alcanzando a reunir tantos escritos que cuando tuvo los recursos propios para publicar un libro le costó trabajo admitir la realidad de que habían pasado de moda; te imaginarás la felicidad y la ilusión que le embarga en estos momentos al saber que sus cartas de amor han recobrado importancia y podrá obtener de ellas un inmenso beneficio, ya que serán su compensación a los enamorados del mundo que contribuyan con la reforestación de la cuenca del río Magdalena.“Su recuerdo más grato de aquella época fue el de una muchachita muy tímida, casi una niña, que le pidió́ temblando escribirle una respuesta para una carta irresistible que acababa de recibir, y que Florentino Ariza reconoció́ como escrita por él la tarde anterior. La contestó con un estilo distinto, acorde con la emoción y la edad de la niña, y con una letra que también pareciera de ella, pues sabía fingir una escritura para cada ocasión según el carácter de cada quien. La escribió́ imaginándose lo que Fermina Daza le hubiera contestado a él si lo quisiera tanto como aquella criatura desamparada quería a su pretendiente. Dos días después, desde luego, tuvo que escribir también la replica del novio con la caligrafía, el estilo y la clase de amor que le había atribuido en la primera carta, y fue así́ como terminó comprometido en una correspondencia febril consigo mismo. Antes de un mes, ambos fueron por separado a darle las gracias por lo que él mismo había propuesto en la carta del novio y aceptado con devoción en la respuesta de la chica: iban a casarse”. El Amor en los Tiempos del Cólera. La felicidad estará de modaSi bien ya se han descrito algunos beneficios racionales y emocionales del proyecto, debemos mencionar adicionalmente que en los años en que Gabriel García Márquez se encontraba escribiendo “El Amor en los Tiempos del Cólera” manifestaba que su propósito era: ""Poner de moda la felicidad"", análogamente este proyecto busca generar éste mismo intangible emocional en todos los ""enamorados, del mundo"" que contribuyan con la causa así como en todas las personas que participen de una u otra forma en su realización.
 


 

5000 árbolesNuestro objetivo es sembrar 5000 árboles nativos en el Magdalena Central Colombiano, a través de cien familias campesinas lideradas por Chavita; todas las ayudas contribuirán con la siembra de éstos árboles cubriendo los costos de gestión y operación en que se incurren generando además un beneficio económico para las comunidades locales que se encargaran de la siembra y cuidado de ellos; sin embargo y dado el propósito a largo plazo que debemos alcanzar, se busca dotar al proyecto de una plataforma tecnológica que nos permita acceder a una masa global de usuarios, propiciando así su escalabilidad.Primer jornada de ""Siembra Amor"" con 300 árboles plantados, abril 29/2017 Por lo anterior, si logramos  la meta de US$100.000.oo no solo habremos iniciado la labor de reforestación en la cuenca del río Magdalena, sino también obtener unas utilidades que se invertirán en tecnologías de la información y las comunicaciones.  En caso de lograr la meta parcialmente, los fondos recogidos serán destinados a la siembra de árboles cubriendo los costos de gestión, así como los de operación y utilidad para las comunidades locales. Turismo literario... naturalmenteEn nuestro ejercicio profesional en Colombia y con el objetivo de diseñar productos turísticos innovadores y diferenciados, hemos desarrollado la línea de turismo literario donde sobresale nuestro Nobel Gabriel García Márquez y su obra, en la cual nuestra exhuberante naturaleza cobra vida. Por su parte “Chavita” desde su ejercicio como gestora ambiental, es una líder innata con reconocidos procesos de repoblamiento y reforestación en diferentes escenarios naturales del país, algunos de los cuales son protagonistas de la obra literaria del Nobel, como lo es en éste caso el Río Magdalena.https://www.radionacional.co/noticia/cultura/las-rutas-del-turismo-literario-colombiahttp://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/CMS-15642239http://columnavip.com/2015/10/cabeto-creador-de-campana-realismo-magico-asesora-a-la-guajira/Teniendo en cuenta la relación histórica entre el Turismo y La Paz, así como los factores de competitividad de la llamada industria sin chimeneas: Tecnología, Innovación y Colaboración; estamos desarrollando desde nuestra organización ""PAZAppORTE"", una plataforma digital con el mismo nombre:La fuerza del amorVale la pena recordar algunos movimientos en los que se ha demostrado la fuerza del amor; uno de ellos inspirado en el personaje imaginario de Julieta de la obra “Romeo y Julieta” en el cual hoy en día deben disponer de 15 mujeres que la personifican como símbolo del amor, dedicadas exclusivamente a responder las cartas que llegan diariamente de todo el mundo a la ciudad de Verona solicitando consejos del corazón. Otro caso es el de los “Candados del Amor” derivado de la obra literaria: “Tengo ganas de ti” de Federico Moccia, en donde las parejas cierran un candado en los puentes y arrojan las llaves al río significando que su amor queda sellado eternamente, lo que ha generado serios inconvenientes en diferentes plataformas del mundo por el peso que tienen que soportar de los miles y en algunos casos millones de cerrojos, razón por la cual han debido retirarlos de los puentes del Arzobispado y de Las Artes en París; lo que nos conduce a pensar que si la fuerza del amor es tal que ha llegado a amenazar tan cimentadas estructuras, porque no utilizarla en ejercicios más loables como la reforestación de la cuenca del río Magdalena. ""Los días siguientes fueron calurosos e interminables. El río se volvió turbio y se fue haciendo cada vez más estrecho, y en vez de la maraña de árboles colosales que había asombrado a Florentino Ariza en su primer viaje, había llanuras calcinadas, desechos de selvas enteras, por la noche no los despertaban los cantos de sirenas de los manatíes en los playones, en lugar de la algarabía de los loros y el escándalo de los micos invisibles que en otro tiempo aumentaban el bochorno del medio día, solo quedaba el vasto silencio de la tierra arrasada"". El Amor en los Tiempos del Cólera.¡Ayudános a difundir nuestra campaña!Los árboles sembrados también te permitirán recoger su fruto:""El Amor"" Este proyecto es un homenaje al Nobel Gabriel García Márquez y su obra literaria.   English Version    ¡We already have 300 ""Trees of Love"" planted!¡Some of them can be yours! For Mónica, of course.Evoking the story “Love in the Time of cholera”, you will remember that the only way in which Florentino Ariza and Fermina Daza can live their idyllic love is sailing the river Magdalena round trip for Lifetime. Now, due to climate change and deforestation, trees have released the land, the river has silted and the ship “New Fidelity” in which this eternal love was sailing has been aground. This situation has turned the couples days humdrum because unlike when they were sailing, now they can´t enjoy the thrilling natural and cultural life that flourishes along the waterfront geography. Such dreariness is ending with the love for which Florentino Ariza waited 53 years, 7 months and 11 days with their nights. How right his uncle Leon XII was, when he said:“Without fluvial sailing there is no love” It is therefore that we need your help with the purpose of reforest the river Magdalena basin so the soil can be hold, the species habitat can be improve and to offer a beautiful landscape, which will allow the loving couple to keep sailing a river Magdalena that thanks to your contribution will be again the fantasy place it used to be.Contributing with the tree sowing you will stoke the couple´s love, which like yours, will grow up as your tree grows because its fruit is precisely: LOVE.  59.110 million treesIn 1981, Gabriel García Márquez wrote for the newspaper El Pais, in Spain: “The rehabilitation of the Magdalena will only be possible with the continuous and deep effort of by at least four aware generations: a whole century doing the technical sowing of 59.110 million trees”. A call that if it had been heeded at that moment we would be meeting at this time 36 years of sowing labour, just a bit more than a third of the mention century. This is why it is so imperative to start as soon as possible, we can´t keep deferring it. Each aid is important because with all of it we will sow trees and every time the goal will be more attainable.First day of ""Sow Love"" with 300 trees planted, April 29, 2017Besides, we will demonstrate that it is possible to develop projects where not only you can obtain profitability, but also an environment, cultural and social profit. Environmental because we will be contributing with the tree sowing of the Magdalena´s river basin; cultural because we will be paying tribute to the Nobel´s work, inspired at the same time in the thrilling cultural life that flourishes in the waterfront geography. And social because it’s the local communities the ones who will be benefit from an activity completely opposite to that that some of them still do in these tropical forests, as deforestation.  The river of life is dyinghttp://www.elespectador.com/noticias/temadeldia/salvar-el-magdalena-articulo-309609http://www.wwf.org.co/?261830/Navegar-o-no-nave... River Magdalena: The protagonistThe river Magdalena, more than a simple scenario or background curtain, is a real main character in Gabriel García Márquez work, as it was in his life, since he roamed it several times during his studying years. These trips described them as a wonderful experience aboard ships full of students with whom he sat down to see life pass through, learning from it “more and better”. Thus if the ship had any delay for several days because of an aground or any other circumstance, there was no problem because the feast of life would extend and the captains of those days would elaborate and stamped an excused absence for the delay.  Love lettersIf you well remember, Florentino Ariza has been characterized for writing encouraging love letters with a great “dazzling power”, with which he has helped to perpetuate the love of plentiful couples, reaching so many writings that when he had his own means to published a book it was hard for him to admit the reality that they were no longer trendy. Can you imagine the happiness and illusion that overwhelms him now to know that his love letters have recovered importance and will be able to receive a great benefit from them, due to that they will be his compensation to all the world lovers that contribute with the sowing of the Magdalena´s river basin.“His fondest memory from that time was that of a very timid little lady, almost a girl, that trembling asked him to write an answer for an irresistible letter she had just receive, and that Florentino Ariza recognized as written by him the evening before. He answered it with a different style, according with the emotion and the age of the girl, and with a letter that also resemble hers, because he knew how to make believe a handwriting for each occasion according to the character of each one. He wrote it imagining what Fermina Daza would have answer him if she love him so much like that helpless creature love her wooer. Two days later, of course, he also had to write the answer of the boyfriend with the calligraphy, style and the type of love he had used in the first letter, and it was so that he ended up involved in a feverish correspondence with himself. Before a month, both went on their own to thank him for what he had proposed in the boyfriends letter and accepted with passion in the answer of the girl: they were going to get married”. Love in the Times of cholera.  Happiness will be in fashionWhile several rational and emotional benefits of the project have been described, we must also mentioned that in those years in which Gabriel García Márquez was writing “Love in Times of cholera” he said that his purpose was to put Happiness trendy. Similarly this project seeks to generate this same emotional intangibly in all those in love around the world that contribute with the cause as well as in all those people that participate in one or other form in accomplishing it. 5000 treesOur target is to plant 5000 native trees at the Colombian Central Magdalena, through 100 peasant families headed by ""Chavita""; all your help will contribute with the tree sowing, covering administration and operation fees in which one incurs generating by the way an economical benefit for the local communities who will be in charge of the sowing and care. Nevertheless and given the long term purpose we must achieve, we are looking forward to provide the project with a technological platform that will allow us to access to a global mass of users providing with it its scalability.First day of ""Sow Love"" with 300 trees planted, April 29, 2017By the above, if we reach the goal of 100.000 dollars we will have not only started the sow tree labors in the Magdalena´s river basin, but also gain some utility that will be invested in technologies for information and communications.  In case the goal is partially achieved, the funds collected will be destined to the tree sowing covering the administration fees as well as those for operation and utility for the local communities. Literary tourism... naturallyIn our professional exercise in Colombia and with the purpose of designing innovative and differentiator  touristic products, we have develop the literary tourism line where our Nobel Gabriel García Márquez and his work stands out, In which our exuberant nature comes to life. For its part ""Chavita"" since its exercise as an environmental manager, is an innate leader with recognized processes of repopulation and reforestation in different natural scenarios of the country, some of which are protagonists of the literary work of the Nobel, as it is in this case The Magdalena River.https://www.radionacional.co/noticia/cultura/las-rutas-del-turismo-literario-colombiahttp://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/CMS-15642239http://columnavip.com/2015/10/cabeto-creador-de-campana-realismo-magico-asesora-a-la-guajira/Taking into account the historical relationship between Tourism and Peace, as well as the competitiveness factors of the so-called industry without chimneys: Technology, Innovation and Collaboration; We are developing from our organization ""PAZAppORTE"", a digital platform with the same name: The strength of loveIt´s worth it to remember some of the movements where the strength of love has been demonstrated.

<h2><strong>Are Bees Really That Important?</strong></h2>
<p>In 1900 a census of beekeepers revealed there were around 1 million honeybee hives in the UK.</p>
<p>In 2015 that number had dropped by almost 75%.</p>
<p>More recently, on 12th April 2018, <i>The Independent</i> newspaper revealed the decline in bees is putting the supply of raw materials for businesses at risk. [link: <a href=""https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/bees-decline-business-supply-chain-un-cambridge-university-asda-pepsico-a8301736.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Independent, Declining bee populations</a>]</p>
<p>Einstein allegedly warned that <strong>without bees the human race will survive for only 4 years</strong>. Whether that's true or not, we do know for sure that <strong>honeybees are responsible for providing us with one third of the food we eat</strong>. They pollinate crops for food, biofuel, habitat for nature and flowers in the beautiful world we live. </p>
<p>There are several causes of the decline of the honeybee population but one key factor is that less people are keeping bees. We are dedicating our farm life to becoming bee farmers; a dying breed of farming with an average age of 63, so we plan to site 250 more honeybee hives here in England over the next 5 years.</p>
<p><strong>We currently care for bees for some of the most iconic brands in Britain</strong>, including: ‘The Ned’ hotel, 'Nobu Hotel Shoreditch' and ‘Restaurant Story’ in London; ‘Prevost’ and ‘Sophie Allport’ in Peterborough and have recently installed and manage the new apiary at Burghley House in Stamford.</p>
<p>From hotels to head offices, <strong>our beehive adoption plans are helping to reverse the decline of the honeybee</strong>, whilst simultaneously encouraging corporate social responsibility, all while providing our customers with their own-brand, 100% British, artisan, raw honey.</p>
<h2><strong>It's Not Just About The Bees...</strong></h2>
<p>Jez and Caroline moved from their suburban 3-bed semi to a dilapidated farm in Lincolnshire just 18 months ago with a mission to reinstate the farm and become bee farmers, helping reverse the decline of the honeybee.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523215811/x9hs7ktjsyntybf9njy5.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523215828/zd4qrp33y8yutwrfkyqr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>My wife and I say that we don't ""keep"" bees; we care for them. We don't clip the queen's wings (so if they want to swarm, they can do, demonstrating natural behaviours) and practice <strong>ethical beekeeping</strong>.</p>
<p>With bees come a number of additional benefits, which you'll be helping to support:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are working with land owners to <strong>sow organic, bee-friendly flowers</strong> to provide critical forage sources for honeybees and other pollinators. This also helps to positively enhance biodiversity.</li>
<li>We're <strong>providing employment and rehabilitation opportunities</strong> in gardening, beekeeping and honey processing for adults with educational and social needs; those recovering from stroke or mental health crisis and wounded members of our armed forces, too. </li>
<li>We're <strong>championing British, raw honey</strong>; something that we export more as a country than we consume! It's completely unlike supermarket honey and converts almost all people who think they don't like honey!.... including me!</li>
<li>More honeybee hives means <strong>more opportunities for businesses</strong> to embrace and engage in an innovative and unique corporate social responsibility (CSR) solution.</li>
<li>Championing <strong>innovative British farming</strong>: like a lot of historical practices operating in a modern world, farming is having to change. This is our way of uniting society with nature and making a positive difference for both.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h2>For Us, For You</h2>
<p>Why don't we go to the bank or continue to seek more adopters? The truth is, we could go to the bank to get funding but one of <strong>our core purposes is to bring people together to share and celebrate in being a part of something for the greater good</strong>.</p>
<p>Supporting our campaign means <strong>you own a share in a real living honeybee hive</strong> (and you can come to visit it, too!); you'll be doing your bit to put more bees into the environment (without any of the mess or fuss - we take care of all of that!) and that our project is true to our aims: people working together, in whatever way, to bring<strong> immediately positive benefits to the environment</strong>, increase British honey production and provide employment and rehabilitation opportunities for those in need.</p>
<p>We want supporters to feel a part of our story because <strong>helping the environment</strong> and the planet on which we live and rely on, is for all of us to consider.</p>
<p>We're offering a number of exciting perks as a sincere ""thank you"" for helping us, helping the bees, helping people who need a stepping stone for the future, helping the environment and ultimately - helping you...</p>
<h2><strong>Where Does The Money Go?</strong></h2>
<p>It turns out that helping the environment isn't cheap. The cost to install one beehive is approximately £450 and there are ongoing maintenance expenses each year, too - that's all before you factor in specialist equipment or even a salary. </p>
<p><strong>Your support goes specifically to buying new colonies of bees, queens and new beehives</strong>, hand made here in England. Our orders help support local, artisan crafts people. With more beehives and colonies of bees, we can provide more adoption plans to engage communities and organisations. The income from those adoption plans pays for the ongoing maintenance and support (disease management and feeding of the bee colonies, for example) and organic seed to sow.</p>
<p>Our salaries come from the income generated from beekeeping workshops and experience days that we run on the farm, which we hope will benefit from the additional interest gained through this campaign.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>Although our project on the farm is relatively new, we've been keen from the start to make an impact and be true to our mantra of: ""100% Ethical, 100% British, 100% Trying To Do The Right Thing"".</p>
<p>Our workshops, experience days and honey sold online consistently receive 5 star reviews. We are members of the Guild of Fine Food; received the Ethical Shopping Award from the Good Shopping Guide; were awarded 5 stars from the Soil Association 'Organic Served Here' project; we've been awarded a Silver award from the Green Tourism Board and our farm is licensed as 'organic in conversion' by the Soil Association.</p>
<p>Being chosen to install and manage the apiary at Burghley House was a huge honour for us - it is the first time in more than 100 years that honeybees have been kept on the estate - and one we carry out with a great sense of privilege. <strong>Our clients love working with us and we love working with them</strong>, too, continually surprising them and delighting them with the wonder of their adopted honeybees. All of our clients to date have chosen to continue to adopt their hives year on year and we like to think that's because our dedication and passion show... although it probably has a lot to do with the delicious honey, too!</p>
<p>We're not going anywhere soon, so stick around and be a part of our exciting journey with the remarkable honeybee...</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Could Possibly Go Wrong?</h3>
<p>Keeping honeybees is working with nature and sometimes nature plays a mighty hand.</p>
<p>There is the possibility that honeybees could die (especially during risky weather periods such as over winter) or due to disease. We have a a very strict policy on sourcing our bees from trusted, true-progeny bee farmers. This means that the bees aren't cross bred and that the breeding is controlled as much as possible to ensure true progeny to the strain of bees we keep here. Buckfast bees were bred over the course of 70 years to have a calm temperament and high honey yield and they are a joy to work with.</p>
<p>Ethical bee keeping is about trying to be one step ahead of natural behaviours and as such we monitor and treat our bees against the most common bee diseases in the UK, part of which involves only taking excess honey, which they naturally make. All of our honey farm operation, including the bees, is insured. We operate a professional CCTV system at the farm and have a trusted network of bee farmers with the same ethical values as us to support our year-round supply of honey should our bees not produce quite enough. When you're dealing with nature, having backups is essential as you never quite know what it's going to do!</p>
<p>We are of course professionally insured, too.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

</div></div>","Are Bees Really That Important?
In 1900 a census of beekeepers revealed there were around 1 million honeybee hives in the UK.
In 2015 that number had dropped by almost 75%.
More recently, on 12th April 2018, The Independent newspaper revealed the decline in bees is putting the supply of raw materials for businesses at risk. [link: The Independent, Declining bee populations]
Einstein allegedly warned that without bees the human race will survive for only 4 years. Whether that's true or not, we do know for sure that honeybees are responsible for providing us with one third of the food we eat. They pollinate crops for food, biofuel, habitat for nature and flowers in the beautiful world we live. 
There are several causes of the decline of the honeybee population but one key factor is that less people are keeping bees. We are dedicating our farm life to becoming bee farmers; a dying breed of farming with an average age of 63, so we plan to site 250 more honeybee hives here in England over the next 5 years.
We currently care for bees for some of the most iconic brands in Britain, including: ‘The Ned’ hotel, 'Nobu Hotel Shoreditch' and ‘Restaurant Story’ in London; ‘Prevost’ and ‘Sophie Allport’ in Peterborough and have recently installed and manage the new apiary at Burghley House in Stamford.
From hotels to head offices, our beehive adoption plans are helping to reverse the decline of the honeybee, whilst simultaneously encouraging corporate social responsibility, all while providing our customers with their own-brand, 100% British, artisan, raw honey.
It's Not Just About The Bees...
Jez and Caroline moved from their suburban 3-bed semi to a dilapidated farm in Lincolnshire just 18 months ago with a mission to reinstate the farm and become bee farmers, helping reverse the decline of the honeybee.

My wife and I say that we don't ""keep"" bees; we care for them. We don't clip the queen's wings (so if they want to swarm, they can do, demonstrating natural behaviours) and practice ethical beekeeping.
With bees come a number of additional benefits, which you'll be helping to support:

We are working with land owners to sow organic, bee-friendly flowers to provide critical forage sources for honeybees and other pollinators. This also helps to positively enhance biodiversity.
We're providing employment and rehabilitation opportunities in gardening, beekeeping and honey processing for adults with educational and social needs; those recovering from stroke or mental health crisis and wounded members of our armed forces, too. 
We're championing British, raw honey; something that we export more as a country than we consume! It's completely unlike supermarket honey and converts almost all people who think they don't like honey!.... including me!
More honeybee hives means more opportunities for businesses to embrace and engage in an innovative and unique corporate social responsibility (CSR) solution.
Championing innovative British farming: like a lot of historical practices operating in a modern world, farming is having to change. This is our way of uniting society with nature and making a positive difference for both.


For Us, For You
Why don't we go to the bank or continue to seek more adopters? The truth is, we could go to the bank to get funding but one of our core purposes is to bring people together to share and celebrate in being a part of something for the greater good.
Supporting our campaign means you own a share in a real living honeybee hive (and you can come to visit it, too!); you'll be doing your bit to put more bees into the environment (without any of the mess or fuss - we take care of all of that!) and that our project is true to our aims: people working together, in whatever way, to bring immediately positive benefits to the environment, increase British honey production and provide employment and rehabilitation opportunities for those in need.
We want supporters to feel a part of our story because helping the environment and the planet on which we live and rely on, is for all of us to consider.
We're offering a number of exciting perks as a sincere ""thank you"" for helping us, helping the bees, helping people who need a stepping stone for the future, helping the environment and ultimately - helping you...
Where Does The Money Go?
It turns out that helping the environment isn't cheap. The cost to install one beehive is approximately £450 and there are ongoing maintenance expenses each year, too - that's all before you factor in specialist equipment or even a salary. 
Your support goes specifically to buying new colonies of bees, queens and new beehives, hand made here in England. Our orders help support local, artisan crafts people. With more beehives and colonies of bees, we can provide more adoption plans to engage communities and organisations. The income from those adoption plans pays for the ongoing maintenance and support (disease management and feeding of the bee colonies, for example) and organic seed to sow.
Our salaries come from the income generated from beekeeping workshops and experience days that we run on the farm, which we hope will benefit from the additional interest gained through this campaign.

The Impact
Although our project on the farm is relatively new, we've been keen from the start to make an impact and be true to our mantra of: ""100% Ethical, 100% British, 100% Trying To Do The Right Thing"".
Our workshops, experience days and honey sold online consistently receive 5 star reviews. We are members of the Guild of Fine Food; received the Ethical Shopping Award from the Good Shopping Guide; were awarded 5 stars from the Soil Association 'Organic Served Here' project; we've been awarded a Silver award from the Green Tourism Board and our farm is licensed as 'organic in conversion' by the Soil Association.
Being chosen to install and manage the apiary at Burghley House was a huge honour for us - it is the first time in more than 100 years that honeybees have been kept on the estate - and one we carry out with a great sense of privilege. Our clients love working with us and we love working with them, too, continually surprising them and delighting them with the wonder of their adopted honeybees. All of our clients to date have chosen to continue to adopt their hives year on year and we like to think that's because our dedication and passion show... although it probably has a lot to do with the delicious honey, too!
We're not going anywhere soon, so stick around and be a part of our exciting journey with the remarkable honeybee...

What Could Possibly Go Wrong?
Keeping honeybees is working with nature and sometimes nature plays a mighty hand.
There is the possibility that honeybees could die (especially during risky weather periods such as over winter) or due to disease. We have a a very strict policy on sourcing our bees from trusted, true-progeny bee farmers. This means that the bees aren't cross bred and that the breeding is controlled as much as possible to ensure true progeny to the strain of bees we keep here. Buckfast bees were bred over the course of 70 years to have a calm temperament and high honey yield and they are a joy to work with.
Ethical bee keeping is about trying to be one step ahead of natural behaviours and as such we monitor and treat our bees against the most common bee diseases in the UK, part of which involves only taking excess honey, which they naturally make. All of our honey farm operation, including the bees, is insured. We operate a professional CCTV system at the farm and have a trusted network of bee farmers with the same ethical values as us to support our year-round supply of honey should our bees not produce quite enough. When you're dealing with nature, having backups is essential as you never quite know what it's going to do!
We are of course professionally insured, too.

Other Ways You Can Help
We know first hand just how expensive helping the environment is and that for many, doing the right thing speaks to their heart but they can't offer financial help.

We understand that and would be grateful for you sharing the campaign online with your friends and family - use the IndieGoGo social media sharing tools, or copy and paste the URL to your own news feed.

<p></p><h3><br/></h3><br/><br/></div>","SHORT SUMMARY:My name is Therman Scott owner of Sreed Am.I worked for the U.S. Forestry for 2 summers fighting forest fires among my duties and I also worked as a volunteer firefighter and Engineer for a County Fire Department for 10 years.There has always been a need for a water supply and fire hoses to aid the firefighter in mountains and hard to reach places in Forest and Wild land fires. I saw a need to provide another method to get water to individuals to put the fire out faster. A system is needed that will reach with water where it is hard for vehicles to reach or impossible to go, and prevent the loss of homes and personal property and life in various types of fires. The loss of ones property or home, having to start all over, and the grief of individuals is something that I have felt a desire to help.
I found a solution for both and called it Octographics. It is an aerial firefighting system. No one has this system and I felt it would mean so much to others to aid in saving their dreams.


Your help is so desperately needed to build this system that is continually available. Firefighter aerial equipment have to leave because night has fallen or it was too smoky to fly. This system can stay day and night and deliver its supply of water, foam or retardant in a very accurate way. We are working to bring to prototype this system ultimately for use around the world. I'll let you know how we are doing.
What We need and what you get
We need more that $40,000 but we want to begin with this initially. In general, would like to have 3 rounds at Indiegogo. One round for testing and manufacturing the prototype, purchase of CH47F heavy duty helicopters and UH-60A/L at gsa.gov auctions, need land and facilities. We need $3-5000 for an animation video to show what the system can do in detail for viewers and trade shows. $350.00 an hour for 4 hours for a business attorney Charles Bone in Tennessee to discuss/make guidelines for hiring individuals and Human resources and any other questions totaling $1400.00. Buy 3 water hoses  1 3/4"" for $231.00 @ 50 ft for $693 and one 2 1/2"" of 50' for $286.00 also needed (12) 1 3/4"" @ 25' for $2772 for prototype and  (4) 2 1/2"" @ 25' for $1044. Total cost of hose less tax and shipping $4795 they all can withstand 1000F and -58f. Needed are 8 suction hoses at 25'. Needed  a 55 hp pump at $12,300 for testing the arms and in wind -  Also nozzles (19) 2"" nozzles $235 total $4,465 and (5) 2 1/2"" at $289.00 total $1445 they open to spray or stream electronically, Nozzles all together without tax and shipping $5910. Fittings to fit the 1 3/4""  hose, fire hydrant, Storz fittings, and spanner wrenches. (4)Hydrant kits( may need to make kit with singles):   This bag contains two hydrant wrenches, one to operate the antitamper device and a ratchet wrench to operate hydrants next to walls or fences; two spanner wrenches; a 4-inch F × 4½-inch NST adapter; a pipe wrench for rounded pentagon nuts; a 2½-inch NSF × 5-inch Storz adapter; 2½-inch caps; a 2½-inch gate valve; a 4½-inch NSF × 5-inch Storz adapter, and a ""T"" handle wrench for operating wall hydrants. Hourly wage for owner 25.00 hr.

If we do not reach our goal we will use the funds to get a animation video and work on getting the prototype finished.
You will  see the unique perks we are offering I think you will like them. You have to see the hand crafted dolls and the GPS system to track items that you may not have thought possible!
The Impact 
The difference your contribution will make will be a major global event. It will enable leaders and individuals who go to work to fight fires an opportunity to have a next generation system that they can truly say it met their expectations. It will be a accurate system that operates safely yet aggressively  in protecting resources, homes, property, and lives.
Risks and Challenges
There is a risk of the owner not running the company  profitably being a first time owner. I have a team of a total now of 4 SCORE counselors that have been advising since about the inception of the invention. There are learned men and women in their field of study and most of them now I have met personally and have talked and listened. Their names are available upon request. They are teaching me how to build a team of leaders to operate the business to a  financial success. 
There is the risk of the market drying up but the market is wide open as fires are breaking out all over the world and governments are asking for help like the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Indonesia, Africa to name a few. Sreed Am is a very marketable solution and one that will get the job done but it take time to grow and be able to support the many calls as the years go by. 
It is a lot to start up a business as large as this and find out the information needed and work with the different vendors and get back to them in a timely way. I have answered calls 24/7 when fighting fires and rescues as a volunteer, always to be  ready as possible for a call of action. I have all times used encouragement  on the fighting line when angers can flare. My plan is to talk with the management team that I will have and we will practice brain storming and other solutions as a team creativity activity  and to reward solutions from individual team members if safe and is found valuable today or tomorrow.

More and more plant diseases that were due to the use of chemical substances and the ensuing resistance of many pests made Swiss researchers think about and focus on natural alternatives. Our idea consisted in developing natural vegetable based agents that should not only be organic, but also environmentally compatible.<br/><br/>All our developments are based on the following assumption: healthy plants, natural growth, devoid of genetic seed manipulation,  as done by competitors. No chemical residues, healthy soil, not salt-affected. Clean water, reduction of nitrogen and  phosphorus in tap water.</p><h3>Sustainability for the benefit of the environment, all humans and future generations.</h3><p>The organic matrix of begreen is produced under our direct control in Thailand, Switzerland and Slovenia. As for the series “begreen concentrates”, some extracts are obtained from plants that exclusively grow in a certain area in Thailand. These plants grow on our own fields in Thailand – i.e. their cultivation is organic, directed, certified and controlled by us. Thus, unnecessary transportation and pollution leading to quality impairment can be avoided. The production of concentrates is one of the approaches pursued by begreen.</p><p>Other product divisions, such as the ones related to fungicides or insect control, are still located in Switzerland. Research and development are coordinated by a team of biologists (in Thailand and Switzerland). The intense cooperation with various institutions and universities in Europe (Central Lab – Thailand, Veritas, universities in the Czech Republic and in SLO etc. ) supports our efforts to produce substances that are 100% vegetable – in line with our vision. begreen cultivates and produces according to the Fair Trade principles.

Our extract, taken from different plants, is an ideal mixture that not only enhances growth, but at the same time strengthens and supports the immune system of the plant treated.

More and more plant diseases that were due to the use of chemical substances and the ensuing resistance of many pests made Swiss researchers think about and focus on natural alternatives. Our idea consisted in developing natural vegetable based agents that should not only be organic, but also environmentally compatible.All our developments are based on the following assumption: healthy plants, natural growth, devoid of genetic seed manipulation,  as done by competitors. No chemical residues, healthy soil, not salt-affected. Clean water, reduction of nitrogen and  phosphorus in tap water.Sustainability for the benefit of the environment, all humans and future generations.The organic matrix of begreen is produced under our direct control in Thailand, Switzerland and Slovenia. As for the series “begreen concentrates”, some extracts are obtained from plants that exclusively grow in a certain area in Thailand. These plants grow on our own fields in Thailand – i.e. their cultivation is organic, directed, certified and controlled by us. Thus, unnecessary transportation and pollution leading to quality impairment can be avoided. The production of concentrates is one of the approaches pursued by begreen.Other product divisions, such as the ones related to fungicides or insect control, are still located in Switzerland. Research and development are coordinated by a team of biologists (in Thailand and Switzerland). The intense cooperation with various institutions and universities in Europe (Central Lab – Thailand, Veritas, universities in the Czech Republic and in SLO etc. ) supports our efforts to produce substances that are 100% vegetable – in line with our vision. begreen cultivates and produces according to the Fair Trade principles. Environment protection and ecology are an essential dictum for us.                                         Rice plantation - begreen  strongly stimulates the photosynthesis, which explains this intensive  green colour. Uniqueness   /   PotentialWhat is it that makes begreen so unique? As we have seen in many pictures, one of the main characteristics of begreen consists in its strong stimulation and support of the photosynthesis process, a fact that is reflected by thicker trunks, much better growth and more intense chlorophyll. What else makes begreen unique? Our extract, taken from different plants, is an ideal mixture that not only enhances growth, but at the same time strengthens and supports the immune system of the plant treated. University tests have shown that begreen has antifungal effects, inhibiting fungal growth by actively combating the fungus. Considering the fact that sick plants treated with begreen quickly recover, this result needs no further explanation. They didn’t start by trying to create Amazon, Apple, and Google. They started by creating an online bookstore, a computer, and a search algorithm.Whether it’s a garage, a basement, or a dorm room, every business has humble beginnings. It’s not about where you start. It’s where you end up.    TestimonialsFungicides effectDear Mrs or. Sir,I have also good experience with begreen on plants that are weak and on grass. In a garden a customer had 15 new plants, which had only 1/3 of needle, even though the soil was in C class of nutrition and pH level was optimal.After 4 year of using begreen through foliar application 2 or 3 times per year plants became very strong and regain their former beauty.Another client has also problem on the grass with take-all fungus (Gaeumannomyces graminis). Last year they used from April until October only begreen as a fertiliser for grass ( 1 x monthly) and the dieback of grass was the mildest after 3 years, when we were using standard long term fertilisers.Best regards,Karin Bejo, univ. dipl. inž agr.PROVRT Against FrostLast year frost almost killed my fig.

<h3>About the project</h3>
<p>Small-scale fishers play an especially important role in food security, poverty eradication, equitable development and sustainable resource utilisation. In Africa alone, marine and inland fisheries have been estimated to contribute towards the food security of 200 million people. But despite the significant role that they play, small-scale fisheries continue to be marginalised and they don’t often receive a fair price for the catches that they bring in. </p>
<p>Equipping, empowering and educating</p>
<p>Enter the <strong>ABALOBI</strong> Initiative (<a href=""http://www.abalobi.info/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.ABALOBI.info</a>) - an open source, trans-disciplinary and social learning endeavor that brings together various stakeholders, with traditional fishers taking center stage. It is a participatory action project with a strong community development interface.</p>
<p><strong>ABALOBI</strong>, as a free mobile app and program, is aimed at social justice and poverty alleviation in the small-scale fisheries chain. This includes transforming the way we access and produce fishing information (tracking fish stocks), stewardship of our marine resources, and resilience building in the face of climate change.</p>
<p>The <strong>ABALOBI</strong> app suite comprises five inter-connected apps that cover the full spectrum of stakeholders in the small-scale fisheries sector ‘from hook to cook’ governance and beyond. One of these components is the <strong>ABALOBI MARKETPLACE </strong>(yet to be launched) - a virtual market where fisher co-ops can share their stories and post their catches on a daily basis. This component is rooted in the idea of community-supported fisheries and is designed to empower fishers in the value chain. At the same time it allows for the development of fisher-community based eco-labeling and marketing mechanisms.</p>
<p>To support this important initiative we need funding for a recipe book that celebrates local fishers from the communities where the ABALOBI app is currently being used. We want to showcase their stories, their tried and trusted recipes and their unique knowledge of the sea.  The end goal of this book is to help local fishers get a better price for their catch while simultaneously giving customers a more direct access point to more sustainable seafood. In other words we want to put fishers in direct contact with environmentally conscious members of the public who want to know where their seafood comes from.</p>
<p>In comes our campaign, a beautiful book and series of short clips showcasing the stories and traditional recipes of the small-scale fishers in the communities where the <strong>ABALOBI</strong> app is currently being used. This book is more than just a simple recipe book, it’s a book about the journey of our seafood, ‘<i>from hook to cook</i>’. It’s a book about the livelihoods of small-scale fisheries in South Africa who are connected to a mobile app that can support them in marketing their own catch. We are not producing this book to sell for profit. We are creating it as a tool to bring these stories of local fishers to life. Doing that will enable these fishers to get a better price for their catch while simultaneously giving costumers access to more sustainable seafood.  </p>

The trainers will support participants through the implementation phase, which will offer incentives in this way—for every 30 meters of contour water-retention canal they dig, the project will pay for another 30 meters to be dug. Based on the training they have received, the farmers will present a design plan that must be approved by two trainers.

Without intervention, it could be a desert in the next 25 years.We have created a strong model with innovative water conservation techniques that have a track record for healing damaged eco-systems—see the video! With your help, we can scale our model, create jobs, train trainers & implement rainwater-harvesting design for this valley and beyond.The project will help:                     1. Conserve water & re-charge springs and aquifers                      2. Increase production & create income for local farmers and workers                      3. Support reforestation & have a stabilizing effect on the rain-water cycle                                        and climateWhy is this project relevant to you now?1.   This area has one of the highest counts of biodiversity in Ecuador, and thus, the world. Climate warming could have a greatly increased effect on species loss here.2.     Ecuador's continued prohibition of GMOs (Genetically Modified Organism) makes it an important GMO-free living seed bank, with potential to provide GMO-free seed to the rest of the world. In South, Central and North America, only Ecuador and Venezuela have maintained bans on GMOs. 3. This project, rather than being funded by governments or large NonGovernmentalOrganizations (NGOs), is being funded by direct grassroots action via crowdfunding, that is, it is funded by you and me.We need to start supporting what is breaking through via what is breaking down in the current system.This photo is a picture of before/and after a water retention landscaping project in the Loess plateau in China. The results are miraculous.Our project is following this model of incentivized implementation. See our video! It shows how this simple and accessible low-tech method can conserve water so reforestation can succeed.More details about how the project will workOnce the retreat place for Incan royalty, Vilcabamba is much-loved throughout Ecuador and is renown as having one of the highest rates of longevity world-wide. It is now suffering from climate change and deforestation. Because of its fame, a success here could ripple far and wide. That’s what we’re designing for.We have a good model in place on our farm—“Finca Vida Verde"", which some refer to as a one acre wonder.  From across the Vilcabamba valley, it is eye-catching because it is greener! Applying the rain-harvesting methods to the one acre we have recently purchased below our land, will allow us to  improve our model, and we will support two larger models.We are opening the opportunity for our new acre to become a small land-based cooperative with three home-owners that collaborate  in expanding our eco-school. And, we are budgeting to support two larger models in the range of 20 hectares to 500 hectares. These models, as they green up, will help inspire water-retention landscaping to become a local trend.We will train trainers to provide basic education in water harvesting and water retention landscaping in 3-day workshops which will provide protocols and guidelines such as width and depth of the canals relative to slope. The workshops will be offered through local organizations such as water boards and farmer’s associations. The trainers will support participants through the implementation phase, which will offer incentives in this way—for every 30 meters of contour water-retention canal they dig, the project will pay for another 30 meters to be dug. Based on the training they have received, the farmers will present a design plan that must be approved by two trainers. Properties will be screened re: appropriate soil/ slope/ and the location’s potential to affect weather patterns favorably.Vilcabamba is in the rain shadow of the Andes of Southern Ecuador. It is a crossroads of Ecuador’s three main eco-zones—the coast, the Andes mountains and the Amazonian lowlands. Accordingly, it has one of the highest counts of biodiversity in Ecuador, and thus, the world. We are dedicated to supporting the diversity of medicinal plants and food crops on our model farms.What can one person do? Back in the '80s, when I was new to the environmental movement, and I first learned about the rate of rain-forest destruction, my OMG !#^! response uprooted me and plopped me down in the African rain-forest for 2 years of field work as a Peace Corps volunteer. My project design was used as a model for a $2.5 million project by the European Union. I learned that sometimes…….if you strategize,  dig in, do what you love, open your mind and heart,  and keep building relationships at all levels……stuff can happen. The pendulum swings. Crusty old patterns that block the Common Good can disintegrate and fall away, and POSITIVE CHANGE HAPPENS.This photo is of us celebrating in Evinayong, Equatorial Guinea when project funding arrived.If you read some of our stories and our bios, you’ll see we have a track record, and I hope you will be moved to send some cash our way! We have a very strong team, backed by decades of relevant experience.  Even more, we hope you will see our story as YOUR story.  Water is life. Changing the way we relate to water, to one of respect and understanding, starts here and now.

<h3><strong>ORGANIC CASHEW OF COLOMBIA: Gemeinsam Positives bewirken!</strong></h3>
<p>Hallo! Wir sind ein Team deutsch-kolumbianischer Freunde aus Hamburg und Bogotá. Gemeinsam mit eurer Unterstützung wollen wir eine <strong>nachhaltig und ökologisch bewirtschaftete Mischplantage</strong> mit der Hauptertragsfrucht Cashew auf unserer Finca Cafmato in Kolumbien aufbauen.</p>
<p>Im November 2016 wurde der <strong>Friedensvertrag </strong>zwischen der kolumbianischen Regierung und den FARC Rebellen geschlossen. Jetzt ist es an der Zeit, die verabschiedeten Vertragsinhalte umzusetzen. Dafür bedarf es wirtschaftlich tragbarer, sozialer und umweltfreundlicher Projekte, die einen ganzheitlichen Ansatz verfolgen.</p>
<p>Mit unserem Projekt ORGANIC CASHEW OF COLOMBIA knüpfen wir genau an dieser Stelle an. Zum einen wollen wir in einer Region, die von dem innerpolitischen Konflikt besonders stark betroffen war, Positives bewirken und dadurch die Umsetzung des Friedensvertrages fördern. Zum anderen wollen wir aufzeigen, dass Projekte der Agrar- und Forstwirtschaft in solch ländlichen Regionen wie dem Department Vichada langfristig erfolgreich sein können.</p>
<p>Diese Zielsetzung wollen wir erreichen, indem wir die lokale Bevölkerung miteinbeziehen, den bestehenden Naturwald der Llanos Orientales schützen und das Prinzip der <strong>ökologischen Landwirtschaft</strong> verfolgen.</p>
<p>Nach dem Pilotprojekt in 2016, wollen wir jetzt in die nächste Phase einsteigen und mit einem Modellprojekt die erlangten Erkenntnisse aus dem Pilotprojekt umsetzen. Dafür wollen wir erste, feste Mitarbeiter vor Ort anstellen, die notwendige Infrastruktur aufbauen und weitere Hektar Cashew-Mischplantage anbauen.</p>
<p>Nutze die Chance und werde jetzt Teil von ORGANIC CASHEW OF COLOMBIA!</p>
<p>LERNE MIT UNS und lass uns gemeinsam Positives vor Ort schaffen –  für Kolumbien, die lokale Bevölkerung und die Llanos Orientales.</p>
<p>Wir freuen uns über deine Unterstützung!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Probleme im Department Vichada</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490615462/th4uh9rweqzhbyi6zdqp.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>Projektstandort im Department Vichada in den Llanos Orientales Kolumbiens</i></p>
<p>Das Department Vichada war vom innerpolitischen Konflikt bis 2012 besonders stark betroffen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Viele Menschen wurden vertrieben und flüchteten in die Städte.</li>
<li>Die Infrastruktur ist wenig ausgebaut und es fehlt an langfristigen Arbeitsplätzen und Bildungsangeboten sowie an Projekten mit nachhaltiger Bewirtschaftung.</li>
<li>Durch das von der Regierung in den 90er Jahren eingeführte Anbauverbot von Koka sowie dem zeitgleich fehlenden Aufzeigen von Alternativen, war und ist die Existenzgrundlage der Bauern nicht mehr gesichert.</li>
<li>Extensive Viehwirtschaft, Monokulturen, Brandrodungen sowie fehlende Bewirtschaftung der freien Flächen und mangelndes Know-how der Bauern führten zu nährstoffarmen Savannenböden.</li>
<li>Anhaltender Raubbau bedroht die jahrhundertealten Naturwälder.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Unsere Lösung: Was wir zusammen erreichen können</strong></h3>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490626395/l4z9tlviexeu1cenhsdu.png"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p>Mit unserem Projekt ORGANIC CASHEW OF COLOMBIA wollen wir in Kolumbiens Llanos Orientales im Department Vichada eine <strong>nachhaltig und ökologisch bewirtschaftete Mischplantage</strong> mit der Hauptertragsfrucht Cashew und unterschiedlichen Nativos (heimische Arten) aufbauen.</p>
<p>Langfristig wollen wir durch unser vielseitiges und nachhaltiges Bodenverbesserungsmanagement die Bodenfruchtbarkeit auf unserer Finca Cafmato erhöhen und eine ertragreiche Cashew-Plantage aufbauen. Den mehr als 60 ha großen bestehenden Naturwald auf unserer Finca wollen wir schützen, aufforsten und in unsere Plantage integrieren.</p>
<p>Für die Menschen vor Ort und insbesondere für die Schule im Dorf El Viento wollen wir Workshops zu den Themen Baumschulmanagement, Biokompostproduktion, Anpflanzung und Baumpflegemanagement auf unserer Finca anbieten und dadurch <strong>Alternativen zur Viehwirtschaft und zum Koka-Anbau</strong> aufzeigen.</p>
<p>Unser Angebot an <strong>Arbeits- und Ausbildungsplätzen</strong> soll den Anwohnern eine langfristige Perspektive auf dem Land bieten, wodurch wir gleichzeitig auch einen Beitrag zum Erhalt des Friedens im Land leisten und einen Anreiz schaffen, aus den überbevölkerten Städten aufs Land zurückzukehren.</p>
<p>Die Projektinitiatoren investierten bereits mehrere hunderttausend Euro in den Kauf der Finca, in Forschungsreisen und den Aufbau des Pilotprojekts in 2016. Nun gilt es, in einem Modellprojekt den nächsten Schritt zu gehen:</p>
<p>Erste, feste Mitarbeiter vor Ort anstellen, die notwendige Infrastruktur aufbauen und weitere Hektar Mischplantage anbauen.</p>
<p><strong>Unser Ziel</strong> ist es, eine gute und gangbare Lösung für alle Beteiligten zu entwickeln, einerseits den Menschen vor Ort eine <strong>echte Perspektive</strong> zu bieten und andererseits eine interessante Impact Investitionsmöglichkeit für Investoren zu schaffen, sodass gleichzeitig die langfristige Finanzierung des Projekts sichergestellt ist.</p>
<h3><strong>Wie wir arbeiten</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Step I: Pilotprojekt 2016</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490615125/gcusyrgjcrssckhoc45z.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>In unserer Baumschule haben wir die Nativo-Setzlinge aufgezogen. Die Cashew-Setzlinge haben wir bei einem kolumbianischen Cashewbauern vor Ort in Auftrag gegeben. Im Oktober 2016 haben wir sämtliche Setzlinge auf zwei Probeflächen à 2 ha auf der Finca Cafmato angepflanzt.</i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490615385/n2o5hqhvdvhu1madsaiz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>Zum Schutz gegen natürlich vorkommende Brände in der Trockenzeit haben wir die Probeflächen mit Feuerschneisen umzogen.</i></p>
<p><strong>Step II: Modellprojekt 2017</strong></p>
<p>Nachdem wir in 2016 das Pilotprojekt auf der Finca Cafmato durchgeführt haben, wollen wir jetzt in 2017 in die nächste Phase einsteigen und in einem Modellprojekt von 30 Hektar die erlangten Erkenntnisse aus dem Pilotprojekt umsetzen.</p>
<p>Mit dem Modellprojekt wollen wir für die Region ein Vorzeigeprojekt schaffen und den Grundstein für eine Skalierung zu einem Impact Investment Modell legen. Die Erfahrung hat gezeigt, dass eins der wichtigsten Kriterien für ein funktionierendes Projekt die Erwirtschaftung von Erträgen und die damit einhergehende finanzielle Unabhängigkeit ist.</p>
<p><strong>Step III: Impact Investment Projekt ab 2018</strong></p>
<p>Ab 2018 planen wir den sukzessiven Aufbau mehrerer hundert Hektar Cashew-Mischplantage, sowie die konkrete Förderung des Cashew-Anbaus in der Region und den Zusammenschluss mit den Cashewbauern vor Ort, um eine Verarbeitungsanlage aufzubauen, die CASHEWS OF COLOMBIA zu vermarkten und dadurch die lokale Wirtschaft zu stärken.</p>
<h3><strong>Um Step II, das Modellprojekt, zu verwirklichen, benötigen wir deine Unterstützung!</strong></h3>

Wir werden die Unternehmen gerne als unsere Sponsoren auf indiegogo, unsere Website und den Social Media Kanälen nennen.</p>
<h3><strong>Warum wir uns für Cashew entschieden haben?</strong></h3>
<p>Cashews eignen sich hervorragend für die Gegebenheiten vor Ort: Durch seine tiefen Wurzeln erreicht der Cashewbaum auch in der Trockenzeit, wenn der Grundwasserspiegel tiefer steht, ausreichend Wasser und Nährstoffe. Zugleich verschafft das tiefe Wurzelwerk dem Baum die notwendige Standfestigkeit, um den starken Winden in der Region standzuhalten. Es ist zudem ein Baum, der <strong>aus der Region</strong> stammt und der an das Ökosystem angepasst ist.</p>
<p>Die Endprodukte des Cashewbaums sind vielseitig: Die Cashewkerne sind ein weltweit gefragtes Nahrungsmittel. Sie sind <strong>gesund, nahrhaft und hochwertig</strong>. Des Weiteren können der Cashewapfel, das Cashewnussschalenöl, sowie das Holz verwertet werden.</p>
<p>Der Cashewbaum trägt ab dem 3. Jahr Früchte und erreicht im 12. Jahr seine endgültige Größe sowie sein Ertragsmaximum. Ein Cashewbaum kann bis zu seinem 30. Lebensjahr ertragreich sein.</p>

<p><i>Während unserer Forschungsreisen nach Kolumbien besuchten wir bestehende Cashewplantagen. Der Cashewapfel ist je nach Art gelblich oder rot gefärbt. An einem Apfel hängt die Cashewnuss, die jeweils einen Cashewkern enthält.</i></p>
<h3><strong>Über die Llanos Orientales</strong></h3>
<p>Die Llanos-Region ist mit jahrhundertealtem Naturwald bedeckt. Durch extensive Land- und Viehwirtschaft sowie stetiges Abholzen und Brandrodungen wird der Wald mehr und mehr zurückgedrängt. Weite Teile der Region sind mit einer Feuchtsavanne überzogen. Der Naturwald besteht in Form von Galeriewäldern entlang der Flussläufe. In ihm kann man die unterschiedlichsten Tier- und Pflanzenarten entdecken.<strong>  </strong> </p>

<h3><strong>Über den Friedensvertrag in Kolumbien</strong></h3>
<p>Im November 2016 wurde nach vierjährigen Verhandlungen zwischen der kolumbianischen Regierung und den FARC-Rebellen der Friedensvertrag geschlossen. Damit wurde der älteste bewaffnete Konflikt in Lateinamerika beendet.</p>
<p>Präsident Juan Manuel Santos wurde für seinen unermüdlichen Einsatz zur Befriedung des Landes der Friedensnobelpreis zuerkannt. <strong>Ein historischer Moment für das Land Kolumbien!</strong></p>
<p>Nun gilt es, die im Friedensvertrag verankerten Inhalte umzusetzen. Dafür bedarf es wirtschaftlich tragfähiger, sozialer und ökologischer Projekte, die mit einer ganzheitlichen Betrachtung eine nachhaltige Perspektive insbesondere für die vom jahrzehntelangen Konflikt besonders stark betroffene ländliche Bevölkerung zu unterstützen.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Unser Team</strong></h3>
<p>Wir, die Initiatoren des Projekts, sind deutsch-kolumbianische Freunde, die sich gemeinsam mit dem operativen Team vor Ort und in Deutschland den Herausforderungen dieses spannenden Projekts stellen wollen. Wir verfügen über die unterschiedlichsten beruflichen Hintergründe, sind Unternehmensberater, Projektierer für (nachhaltige) Investitionsmöglichkeiten, Anwälte sowie Agrar- und Forstwissenschaftler. Wir fühlen uns mit dem Land Kolumbien aus unterschiedlichen Gründen stark verbunden und uns eint der Wille, Positives vor Ort zu bewirken. Unser Ziel ist es, das Potenzial, das die Llanos-Region mit sich bringt, herauszustellen und Wege aufzuzeigen, wie Projekte an einem Standort, wie dem Department Vichada, funktionieren können und zeitgleich die lokale Bevölkerung und das Ökosystem unterstützen. Unsere vielseitigen Expertisen erweisen sich für die Umsetzung dieses facettenreichen Projekts als sehr nützlich.</p>

<h3>ORGANIC CASHEW OF COLOMBIA</h3>
<p>Ayúdanos a reforestar los degradados suelos de las sabanas en los Llanos Orientales de Colombia, a mostrar nuevas alternativas de cultivo de coca a las poblaciones rurales y a brindarles las perspectivas y oportunidades de empleo para apoyar la paz que tanto han esperado.</p>
<p><strong>Por medio de tu apoyo juntos podemos lograr...</strong></p>
<p>... un proyecto ecológico y sostenible en una de las zonas más vírgenes del mundo, los Llanos Orientales de Colombia, así como proteger y reforestar los bosques naturales ya existentes.</p>
<p>... apoyar a la población rural mostrándole nuevos métodos de cultivo, diferentes culturas y ampliando sus perspectivas por medio de nuevos empleos y plazas de formación.</p>
<p>...alentar la implementación del acuerdo de paz concluido a finales de noviembre de 2016, después de décadas de conflicto entre el gobierno y los rebeldes de las FARC.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>El problema del Departamento de Vichada</h3>
<p>El Departamento de Vichada se vio especialmente afectado por el conflicto político interno hasta el año 2012:</p>
<p>Muchas personas fueron desplazadas y huyeron a las ciudades, la infraestructura está menos desarrollada y hay una enorme falta de puestos de trabajo a largo plazo, oportunidades de aprendizaje y proyectos de gestión sostenible.</p>
<p>Debido a la prohibición del gobierno sobre el cultivo de la cacao introducida en los años 90 y la falta simultánea de demostración de alternativas, el sustento de los agricultores ya no está garantizado.</p>
<p>La ganadería extensiva, los monocultivos, la tala y quema de árboles, la falta de gestión de los espacios abiertos y la falta de conocimiento de los agricultores provocaron la falta de nutrientes en los suelos de la sabana. La constante sobreexplotación amenaza los bosques naturales.</p>
<h3>Nuestra Solución</h3>
<p>Con nuestro proyecto ORGANIC CASHEW OF COLOMBIA queremos construir una plantación mixta de agricultura sostenible y orgánica en el Departamento de Vichada en los Llanos Orientales en Colombia, teniendo así el cultivo del marañón como fruta de cultivo principal, aparte de diferentes nativos (especies nativas).</p>
<p>Nuestro objetivo a largo plazo es aumentar la fertilidad del suelo en nuestra finca Cafmato manejándolo de una manera sostenible y versátil, así como construir una plantación rentable de marañón. Buscamos proteger las más de 60 hectáreas de bosque natural existentes en nuestra finca, reforestarlas e integrarlas a la plantación.</p>
<p>Para la gente local y, en particular para la escuela en el pueblo ¨El Viento¨ queremos ofrecer talleres sobre manejo de viveros, siembra, manejo y cuidado de árboles en nuestra finca y presentar alternativas a la ganadería y el cultivo del coca.</p>
<p>Por medio de nuestra oferta de puestos de trabajo y plazas de formación para los residentes locales, buscamos crear una perspectiva a largo plazo en el campo con la que podamos contribuir al mantenimiento de la paz y crear un incentivo para regresar al campo de las ciudades superpobladas.</p>
<p>Los creadores del proyecto ya han invertido varios cientos de miles de euros en la compra de la finca, en viajes de investigación y en el desarrollo del proyecto piloto en 2016. Ahora es el momento de dar el siguiente paso con un proyecto modelo:<br/><br/>Contratar primeros empleados permanentes en nuestra finca, construir la infraestructura necesaria e instalar hectáreas adicionales de la plantación mixta.</p>
<p>Nuestro objetivo es desarrollar una solución buena y viable para todas las partes involucradas. Por un lado, ofrecer a los locales una perspectiva real y por el otro, crear una oportunidad de Impact Investing (inversión de impacto) atractiva para los inversionistas, de modo que se garantice al mismo tiempo la financiación a largo plazo del proyecto.</p>
<h3>
<br/>Nuestro Trabajo</h3>
<p><br/><strong>Paso I: Proyecto Piloto 2016</strong></p>
<p>Hemos criado plántulas de especies nativos en nuestro vivero. Las plántulas de marañón obtuvimos por un agricultor de marañón local En octubre de 2016, se logró la plantación de todas las plántulas en dos parcelas de 2 hectáreas en la Finca Cafmato.</p>
<p><strong>Paso II: Proyecto Modelo 2017</strong></p>
<p>Después de haber llevado a cabo el proyecto piloto sobre la finca Cafmato en 2016, queremos comenzar con la siguiente etapa en 2017 y poner en práctica un proyecto modelo de 30 hectáreas, con los conocimientos adquiridos en el proyecto piloto.<br/>Con el proyecto modelo queremos crear un proyecto emblemático para la región y sentar las bases para la transición a un modelo de Impact Investing. La experiencia ha demostrado que uno de los principales criterios para el buen funcionamiento de un proyecto es la generación de ingresos y la independencia financiera.</p>
<p><strong>Paso III: Proyecto de Inversión de Impacto (Impact Investing Projekt) a partir de 2018</strong></p>
<p>A partir del 2018, tenemos la intención de construir progresivamente una plantación mixta de marañón en varios cientos de hectáreas, así como la promoción del cultivo de dicho fruto en la región y la fusión con los productores a nivel local, para así establecer la producción de ORGANIC CASHEWS OF COLOMBIA y fortalecer al mismo tiempo la economía local.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>¡Necesitamos tu apoyo para poder implementar el Paso II, Proyecto Modelo 2017!</strong></p>

<h3>Los Llanos Orientales</h3>
<p>Algún tiempo atras, Los Llanos estaban cubiertos de bosques naturales centenarios. Debido a la agricultura y ganadería extensivas,  así como la tala de árboles y quemas el bosque ha ido desapareciendo poco a poco. Hoy en día, la región está cubierta con una sabana húmeda. La región está cubierta  por bosques a las orillas de los ríos. En ella se puede encontrar una amplia variedad de flora y fauna.</p>
<h3>El Marañón (Cashew)</h3>
<p>El marañón es idealmente adecuado para las condiciones locales: cuenta con raíces profundas que le permiten alcanzar y almacenar el agua y los nutrientes suficientes incluso en la estación seca cuando el nivel freático es más profundo.  Al mismo tiempo, este tipo de raíz da al árbol la estabilidad necesaria para aguantar los fuertes vientos en la región. Es a final de cuentas un árbol proveniente de la región que está adaptada perfectamente al ecosistema.</p>
<p>Los productos finales del árbol de marañón son muy versátiles: la almendra de marañón forma parte de la demanda de alimentos a nivel mundial por su alta, nutritiva y sana calidad. Por otra parte se puede hacer uso de la manzana del marañón como tal, del liquido que se extrae de la cáscara de la nuez de marañón y de la madera del árbol.</p>
<p>El árbol produce el fruto a partir del 3er año y alcanza su tamaño final al año 12. Un árbol de marañón puede ser productivo por hasta 30 años.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>El Acuerdo de Paz</h3>
<p>En noviembre de 2016, el acuerdo de paz se concluyó después de cuatro años de negociaciones entre el gobierno colombiano y las FARC. Dando así por terminado el conflicto armado más antiguo en Latinoamérica. </p>
<p>El presidente Juan Manuel Santos fue galardonado al Premio Nobel de la Paz por sus incansables esfuerzos para lograr la paz en el país.<strong> ¡Un momento histórico para Colombia!</strong><br/><br/>Ahora es el momento de poner en práctica los contenidos del acuerdo de paz. Para lograr eso es necesario iniciar y apoyar los proyectos sociales y ambientales que siguen una consideración al completa y que así establecen una perspectiva sostenible, sobre todo para las regiones rurales que se vieron afectados fuertemente afectadas por décadas debido a dicho conflicto.</p>

<p><strong>ORGANIC CASHEW OF COLOMBIA: Create Positive Impact</strong></p>
<p>Hello! We are a team of German-Colombian friends working in Hamburg, Bogotá and in the Department of Vichada, Colombia. We want to establish a <strong>sustainable mixed plantation with cashew</strong> as the main crop at out Finca Cafmato.</p>
<p>With our project ORGANIC CASHEW OF COLOMBIA we want to create a positive impact in a region that has particularly suffered from the decades-long conflict in the Country.</p>
<p>In November 2016 the <strong>peace agreement</strong> between the Colombian Government and the rebels of the FARC was concluded. Now it´s time to put the contents included in the peace agreement into practice.</p>
<p>This requires projects that are <strong>economically viable, social, and eco-friendly</strong> and that are led by a holistic approach. With ORGANIC CASHEW OF COLOMBIA we want to prove how projects in a rural place like the Department of Vichada can be successful by integrating the local population and protecting the environment in the Llanos Orientales.</p>
<p>After a pilot project, we want to apply our acquired knowledge and start a 30-hectar model project. Therefore we need to hire first permanent workers for our Finca Cafmato, build up the necessary infrastructure and increase the size of the mixed plantation.</p>
<p>Be part of ORGANIC CASHEW IN COLOMBIA and support us NOW !</p>
<p>LEARN WITH US and create a positive impact to Colombia, the local people and the Llanos Orientales.</p>
<h3><strong>Problems in the Department of Vichada</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Department of Vichada was particularly affected by the internal political conflict that lasted until 2012:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Many people were forced out of their villages and fled to the cities</li>
<li>The infrastructure is underdeveloped and there is a huge lack of reliable work and training opportunities, as well as of sustainable cultivating projects</li>
<li>Due to the prohibition of the cultivation of coca that was introduced in the 90s and the shortage of alternative opportunities, the prospect of a secure livelihood for farmers was reduced.</li>
<li>Extensive livestock farming, monocultures, fire erosion as well as the lack of cultivation of vacant spaces and the missing know-how of the farmers resulted in nutrient-poor savannah soils.</li>
<li>Existent overexploitation endangers the centuries old natural forests.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Our Solution: What we can achieve together</h3>
<p>With our project, ORGANIC CASHEW OF COLOMBIA, we want to establish a sustainable and eco-friendly mixed plantation focusing on the cultivation of cashews and various native crops in the Department of Vichada in the Llanos Orientales in Colombia.</p>
<p>In the long run, we aim to substantially increase the soil fertility at our Finca Cafmato through our versatile and sustainable soil improvement management and build a flourishing cashew plantation. We intend to protect, reforest and integrate more than 60 hectares of natural forest that expands across our finca.</p>
<p>For the local population, and in particular for the school located in the small village of “El Viento”, we aim to develop workshops focusing on the management of plant nurseries, production of bio compost as well as tree planting and tree maintenance at our finca in order to show them alternatives to cattle farming and coca cultivation.</p>
<p>Our offer of job and training places is designed to provide residents with a long-term perspective in the countryside, which will simultaneously help to maintain peace and incentivize them to return from the overpopulated cities back to the rural areas.</p>
<p>The project initiators have already invested several hundred thousand Euros in the purchase of the finca, in research trips and in the development of the pilot project in 2016. Our next step is to develop a model project in 2017:</p>
<p>With the main goals to hire first permanent workers for our finca, to build the necessary infrastructure and increase the size of the mixed plantation.</p>
<p>Our goal is to benefit all participants: on the one hand, to give the local people a solid and secure perspective and, on the other hand, to create an impact investment opportunity for investors, so that the project financing is guaranteed on a long-term basis.</p>
<h3>This is how we work</h3>
<p><strong>Step I: Pilot Project 2016</strong></p>
<p>In our tree nursery, we raised the native seedlings which we commissioned from a local Colombian cashew farmer. In October 2016, we planted all the seedlings on two sample surfaces of 2 hectares at our Finca Cafmato.</p>
<p><strong>Step II: Model Project 2017</strong></p>
<p>After the realization of the pilot project at the Finca Cafmato in 2016, we would like to move into the next phase in 2017 by starting a 30-hectar model project applying our acquired knowledge from the pilot project.</p>
<p>With the Model Project, we want to establish a flagship project for the region and lay the foundations for an impact investment model. Experience has shown that one of the most important criteria for a successful project is the generation of income and therefore the financial independence.</p>
<p><strong>Step III: Impact Investment Project on 2018</strong></p>
<p>From 2018 onwards, we plan the successive construction of a mixed cashew plantation of several hundred hectares. Furthermore, we want to support the cashew cultivation in the region by cooperating with local cashew farmers in order to build a processing plant, to market the CASHEWS OF COLOMBIA and therefore strengthen the local economy.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>In order to implement Step II, the Model Project, we need your support!</strong></p>
<h3>What you give and what you get</h3>
<p>The funds raised by this campaign will be directed to the financing of the Model Project in 2017:</p>
<p>Plantation administrators and employees:              103.000 EUR<br/>Plants and organic fertilizer:                                            31.000 EUR<br/><u>Infrastructure &amp; Fleet:                                                       46.000 EUR</u><br/><strong>In total we want to raise:                                       180.000 EUR</strong></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>We offer Unique Perks</strong></h3>
<p>Have you ever wanted to plant a tree but didn't know how and where? Take your chance!</p>
<p>For 250 EUR we'll <strong>plant a tree in your name as a godmother or godfather</strong> at Finca Cafmatos where you can come to visit, in the state of Vichada in Colombia. You want more? For 500 EUR we'll plant 2 trees, for 1.000 EUR we´ll 4 and for 5.000 EUR even 20  trees. If you want to feel like a land owner, be a Godparent of a Cashew Forest for 1/2 hectare of land (10.000 EUR).</p>
<p>Of course we plant your trees also in the name of your choice. Just let us know under info@colombiacompanions.com!</p>
<p>For all the adventurers out there we offer a <strong>Visit to our Finca Cafmato</strong> to spend some days with us in Colombia. Get to know the team and the project and enjoy a exclusive guided tour at our plantation (20.000 EUR).</p>
<p>All of our supporters will be honored on our <strong>Wall of Fame </strong>on our Website and receive a digital e-card as expression of our utnost gratitude.</p>
<h3><strong>Why we Chose Cashews?</strong></h3>
<p>Cultivating cashews works excellent under the local conditions: Thanks to its deep roots, the cashew tree is able to reach sufficient water and nutrients even if ground-water level is low due to dry season. Besides that, the deep roots provide stability in order to stand the strong winds of the region. Cashew trees are <strong>native </strong>to Colombia and are <strong>adapted to the ecosystem</strong>.  </p>
<p>The final products of the cashew tree are very diverse: the cashew kernels are highly demanded worldwide. They are a <strong>healthy</strong>, <strong>nutritious</strong>, and of high-quality. Furthermore, you can make use of cashew apples, cashew oil and the wood from the cashew trees.</p>
<p>The cashew tree produces its fruits from  the 3rd year onwards and it reaches its final height in the 12th year. A cashew tree can be productive for up to 30 years.</p>
<h3><strong>About the Llanos Orientales</strong></h3>
<p>The Llanos Region is covered by <strong>centuries old forest</strong>. Due to extensive land- and livestock farming, as well as steady deforestation and slash-and-burn, the forest is increasingly pushed back. Major parts of the region is covered with wet savanna. The natural forest consists of gallery forests along the river beds with a <strong>broad diversity of plants and animals</strong>. </p>
<h3>About the Peace Agreement in Colombia</h3>
<p>After four years of negotiation between the Colombian Government and the rebels of the FARC, the peace agreement was concluded in November 2016. Therefore, one of the longest armed conflicts in Latin-America came to an end.</p>
<p>President Juan Manuel Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize after his restless attempts of achieving peace for his country. <strong>A historical moment for Colombia!</strong></p>
<p>Now it´s time to put the contents included in the peace agreement into practice. This requires economically viable, social, and eco-friendly projects, that are led by an integral approach to shape a sustainable perspective for the rural population that has particularly suffered from the decades long conflict.   </p>
<h3>Our Team</h3>
<p>We, the initiators of the project, are four German-Colombian friends who want to meet the challenge of realizing this exciting project together with the operating team in Colombia and in Germany. We have different professional backgrounds such as management consulting, project managing for sustainable investments, law, and agricultural and forest science. We are strongly bonded to Colombia for different reasons and share the intention of creating a positive impact in the country. Our objective is to make the best out of the potential of the region Llanos Orientals and to prove how projects in a place like the Department of Vichada can be successful while supporting the local population and protecting the environment. Our diverse areas of expertise help us ensure the success of our multifaceted project.</p>

ORGANIC CASHEW OF COLOMBIA: Gemeinsam Positives bewirken!
Hallo! Wir sind ein Team deutsch-kolumbianischer Freunde aus Hamburg und Bogotá. Gemeinsam mit eurer Unterstützung wollen wir eine nachhaltig und ökologisch bewirtschaftete Mischplantage mit der Hauptertragsfrucht Cashew auf unserer Finca Cafmato in Kolumbien aufbauen.
Im November 2016 wurde der Friedensvertrag zwischen der kolumbianischen Regierung und den FARC Rebellen geschlossen. Jetzt ist es an der Zeit, die verabschiedeten Vertragsinhalte umzusetzen. Dafür bedarf es wirtschaftlich tragbarer, sozialer und umweltfreundlicher Projekte, die einen ganzheitlichen Ansatz verfolgen.
Mit unserem Projekt ORGANIC CASHEW OF COLOMBIA knüpfen wir genau an dieser Stelle an. Zum einen wollen wir in einer Region, die von dem innerpolitischen Konflikt besonders stark betroffen war, Positives bewirken und dadurch die Umsetzung des Friedensvertrages fördern. Zum anderen wollen wir aufzeigen, dass Projekte der Agrar- und Forstwirtschaft in solch ländlichen Regionen wie dem Department Vichada langfristig erfolgreich sein können.
Diese Zielsetzung wollen wir erreichen, indem wir die lokale Bevölkerung miteinbeziehen, den bestehenden Naturwald der Llanos Orientales schützen und das Prinzip der ökologischen Landwirtschaft verfolgen.
Nach dem Pilotprojekt in 2016, wollen wir jetzt in die nächste Phase einsteigen und mit einem Modellprojekt die erlangten Erkenntnisse aus dem Pilotprojekt umsetzen. Dafür wollen wir erste, feste Mitarbeiter vor Ort anstellen, die notwendige Infrastruktur aufbauen und weitere Hektar Cashew-Mischplantage anbauen.
Nutze die Chance und werde jetzt Teil von ORGANIC CASHEW OF COLOMBIA!
LERNE MIT UNS und lass uns gemeinsam Positives vor Ort schaffen –  für Kolumbien, die lokale Bevölkerung und die Llanos Orientales.
Wir freuen uns über deine Unterstützung!
 
Probleme im Department Vichada

Projektstandort im Department Vichada in den Llanos Orientales Kolumbiens
Das Department Vichada war vom innerpolitischen Konflikt bis 2012 besonders stark betroffen:

Viele Menschen wurden vertrieben und flüchteten in die Städte.
Die Infrastruktur ist wenig ausgebaut und es fehlt an langfristigen Arbeitsplätzen und Bildungsangeboten sowie an Projekten mit nachhaltiger Bewirtschaftung.
Durch das von der Regierung in den 90er Jahren eingeführte Anbauverbot von Koka sowie dem zeitgleich fehlenden Aufzeigen von Alternativen, war und ist die Existenzgrundlage der Bauern nicht mehr gesichert.
Extensive Viehwirtschaft, Monokulturen, Brandrodungen sowie fehlende Bewirtschaftung der freien Flächen und mangelndes Know-how der Bauern führten zu nährstoffarmen Savannenböden.
Anhaltender Raubbau bedroht die jahrhundertealten Naturwälder.

Unsere Lösung: Was wir zusammen erreichen können

Mit unserem Projekt ORGANIC CASHEW OF COLOMBIA wollen wir in Kolumbiens Llanos Orientales im Department Vichada eine nachhaltig und ökologisch bewirtschaftete Mischplantage mit der Hauptertragsfrucht Cashew und unterschiedlichen Nativos (heimische Arten) aufbauen.
Langfristig wollen wir durch unser vielseitiges und nachhaltiges Bodenverbesserungsmanagement die Bodenfruchtbarkeit auf unserer Finca Cafmato erhöhen und eine ertragreiche Cashew-Plantage aufbauen. Den mehr als 60 ha großen bestehenden Naturwald auf unserer Finca wollen wir schützen, aufforsten und in unsere Plantage integrieren.
Für die Menschen vor Ort und insbesondere für die Schule im Dorf El Viento wollen wir Workshops zu den Themen Baumschulmanagement, Biokompostproduktion, Anpflanzung und Baumpflegemanagement auf unserer Finca anbieten und dadurch Alternativen zur Viehwirtschaft und zum Koka-Anbau aufzeigen.
Unser Angebot an Arbeits- und Ausbildungsplätzen soll den Anwohnern eine langfristige Perspektive auf dem Land bieten, wodurch wir gleichzeitig auch einen Beitrag zum Erhalt des Friedens im Land leisten und einen Anreiz schaffen, aus den überbevölkerten Städten aufs Land zurückzukehren.
Die Projektinitiatoren investierten bereits mehrere hunderttausend Euro in den Kauf der Finca, in Forschungsreisen und den Aufbau des Pilotprojekts in 2016. Nun gilt es, in einem Modellprojekt den nächsten Schritt zu gehen:
Erste, feste Mitarbeiter vor Ort anstellen, die notwendige Infrastruktur aufbauen und weitere Hektar Mischplantage anbauen.
Unser Ziel ist es, eine gute und gangbare Lösung für alle Beteiligten zu entwickeln, einerseits den Menschen vor Ort eine echte Perspektive zu bieten und andererseits eine interessante Impact Investitionsmöglichkeit für Investoren zu schaffen, sodass gleichzeitig die langfristige Finanzierung des Projekts sichergestellt ist.
Wie wir arbeiten
Step I: Pilotprojekt 2016

In unserer Baumschule haben wir die Nativo-Setzlinge aufgezogen. Die Cashew-Setzlinge haben wir bei einem kolumbianischen Cashewbauern vor Ort in Auftrag gegeben. Im Oktober 2016 haben wir sämtliche Setzlinge auf zwei Probeflächen à 2 ha auf der Finca Cafmato angepflanzt.

Zum Schutz gegen natürlich vorkommende Brände in der Trockenzeit haben wir die Probeflächen mit Feuerschneisen umzogen.
Step II: Modellprojekt 2017
Nachdem wir in 2016 das Pilotprojekt auf der Finca Cafmato durchgeführt haben, wollen wir jetzt in 2017 in die nächste Phase einsteigen und in einem Modellprojekt von 30 Hektar die erlangten Erkenntnisse aus dem Pilotprojekt umsetzen.
Mit dem Modellprojekt wollen wir für die Region ein Vorzeigeprojekt schaffen und den Grundstein für eine Skalierung zu einem Impact Investment Modell legen. Die Erfahrung hat gezeigt, dass eins der wichtigsten Kriterien für ein funktionierendes Projekt die Erwirtschaftung von Erträgen und die damit einhergehende finanzielle Unabhängigkeit ist.
Step III: Impact Investment Projekt ab 2018
Ab 2018 planen wir den sukzessiven Aufbau mehrerer hundert Hektar Cashew-Mischplantage, sowie die konkrete Förderung des Cashew-Anbaus in der Region und den Zusammenschluss mit den Cashewbauern vor Ort, um eine Verarbeitungsanlage aufzubauen, die CASHEWS OF COLOMBIA zu vermarkten und dadurch die lokale Wirtschaft zu stärken.
Um Step II, das Modellprojekt, zu verwirklichen, benötigen wir deine Unterstützung!

Wir werden die Unternehmen gerne als unsere Sponsoren auf indiegogo, unsere Website und den Social Media Kanälen nennen.
Warum wir uns für Cashew entschieden haben?
Cashews eignen sich hervorragend für die Gegebenheiten vor Ort: Durch seine tiefen Wurzeln erreicht der Cashewbaum auch in der Trockenzeit, wenn der Grundwasserspiegel tiefer steht, ausreichend Wasser und Nährstoffe. Zugleich verschafft das tiefe Wurzelwerk dem Baum die notwendige Standfestigkeit, um den starken Winden in der Region standzuhalten. Es ist zudem ein Baum, der aus der Region stammt und der an das Ökosystem angepasst ist.
Die Endprodukte des Cashewbaums sind vielseitig: Die Cashewkerne sind ein weltweit gefragtes Nahrungsmittel. Sie sind gesund, nahrhaft und hochwertig. Des Weiteren können der Cashewapfel, das Cashewnussschalenöl, sowie das Holz verwertet werden.
Der Cashewbaum trägt ab dem 3. Jahr Früchte und erreicht im 12. Jahr seine endgültige Größe sowie sein Ertragsmaximum. Ein Cashewbaum kann bis zu seinem 30. Lebensjahr ertragreich sein.

Während unserer Forschungsreisen nach Kolumbien besuchten wir bestehende Cashewplantagen. Der Cashewapfel ist je nach Art gelblich oder rot gefärbt. An einem Apfel hängt die Cashewnuss, die jeweils einen Cashewkern enthält.
Über die Llanos Orientales
Die Llanos-Region ist mit jahrhundertealtem Naturwald bedeckt. Durch extensive Land- und Viehwirtschaft sowie stetiges Abholzen und Brandrodungen wird der Wald mehr und mehr zurückgedrängt. Weite Teile der Region sind mit einer Feuchtsavanne überzogen. Der Naturwald besteht in Form von Galeriewäldern entlang der Flussläufe. In ihm kann man die unterschiedlichsten Tier- und Pflanzenarten entdecken.   

Wunderschöne Eindrücke der Llanos Orientales
 
Über den Friedensvertrag in Kolumbien
Im November 2016 wurde nach vierjährigen Verhandlungen zwischen der kolumbianischen Regierung und den FARC-Rebellen der Friedensvertrag geschlossen. Damit wurde der älteste bewaffnete Konflikt in Lateinamerika beendet.
Präsident Juan Manuel Santos wurde für seinen unermüdlichen Einsatz zur Befriedung des Landes der Friedensnobelpreis zuerkannt. Ein historischer Moment für das Land Kolumbien!
Nun gilt es, die im Friedensvertrag verankerten Inhalte umzusetzen. Dafür bedarf es wirtschaftlich tragfähiger, sozialer und ökologischer Projekte, die mit einer ganzheitlichen Betrachtung eine nachhaltige Perspektive insbesondere für die vom jahrzehntelangen Konflikt besonders stark betroffene ländliche Bevölkerung zu unterstützen.
 
Unser Team
Wir, die Initiatoren des Projekts, sind deutsch-kolumbianische Freunde, die sich gemeinsam mit dem operativen Team vor Ort und in Deutschland den Herausforderungen dieses spannenden Projekts stellen wollen.

El problema del Departamento de Vichada
El Departamento de Vichada se vio especialmente afectado por el conflicto político interno hasta el año 2012:
Muchas personas fueron desplazadas y huyeron a las ciudades, la infraestructura está menos desarrollada y hay una enorme falta de puestos de trabajo a largo plazo, oportunidades de aprendizaje y proyectos de gestión sostenible.
Debido a la prohibición del gobierno sobre el cultivo de la cacao introducida en los años 90 y la falta simultánea de demostración de alternativas, el sustento de los agricultores ya no está garantizado.
La ganadería extensiva, los monocultivos, la tala y quema de árboles, la falta de gestión de los espacios abiertos y la falta de conocimiento de los agricultores provocaron la falta de nutrientes en los suelos de la sabana. La constante sobreexplotación amenaza los bosques naturales.
Nuestra Solución
Con nuestro proyecto ORGANIC CASHEW OF COLOMBIA queremos construir una plantación mixta de agricultura sostenible y orgánica en el Departamento de Vichada en los Llanos Orientales en Colombia, teniendo así el cultivo del marañón como fruta de cultivo principal, aparte de diferentes nativos (especies nativas).
Nuestro objetivo a largo plazo es aumentar la fertilidad del suelo en nuestra finca Cafmato manejándolo de una manera sostenible y versátil, así como construir una plantación rentable de marañón. Buscamos proteger las más de 60 hectáreas de bosque natural existentes en nuestra finca, reforestarlas e integrarlas a la plantación.
Para la gente local y, en particular para la escuela en el pueblo ¨El Viento¨ queremos ofrecer talleres sobre manejo de viveros, siembra, manejo y cuidado de árboles en nuestra finca y presentar alternativas a la ganadería y el cultivo del coca.
Por medio de nuestra oferta de puestos de trabajo y plazas de formación para los residentes locales, buscamos crear una perspectiva a largo plazo en el campo con la que podamos contribuir al mantenimiento de la paz y crear un incentivo para regresar al campo de las ciudades superpobladas.
Los creadores del proyecto ya han invertido varios cientos de miles de euros en la compra de la finca, en viajes de investigación y en el desarrollo del proyecto piloto en 2016. Ahora es el momento de dar el siguiente paso con un proyecto modelo:Contratar primeros empleados permanentes en nuestra finca, construir la infraestructura necesaria e instalar hectáreas adicionales de la plantación mixta.
Nuestro objetivo es desarrollar una solución buena y viable para todas las partes involucradas. Por un lado, ofrecer a los locales una perspectiva real y por el otro, crear una oportunidad de Impact Investing (inversión de impacto) atractiva para los inversionistas, de modo que se garantice al mismo tiempo la financiación a largo plazo del proyecto.

Nuestro Trabajo
Paso I: Proyecto Piloto 2016
Hemos criado plántulas de especies nativos en nuestro vivero. Las plántulas de marañón obtuvimos por un agricultor de marañón local En octubre de 2016, se logró la plantación de todas las plántulas en dos parcelas de 2 hectáreas en la Finca Cafmato.
Paso II: Proyecto Modelo 2017
Después de haber llevado a cabo el proyecto piloto sobre la finca Cafmato en 2016, queremos comenzar con la siguiente etapa en 2017 y poner en práctica un proyecto modelo de 30 hectáreas, con los conocimientos adquiridos en el proyecto piloto.Con el proyecto modelo queremos crear un proyecto emblemático para la región y sentar las bases para la transición a un modelo de Impact Investing. La experiencia ha demostrado que uno de los principales criterios para el buen funcionamiento de un proyecto es la generación de ingresos y la independencia financiera.
Paso III: Proyecto de Inversión de Impacto (Impact Investing Projekt) a partir de 2018
A partir del 2018, tenemos la intención de construir progresivamente una plantación mixta de marañón en varios cientos de hectáreas, así como la promoción del cultivo de dicho fruto en la región y la fusión con los productores a nivel local, para así establecer la producción de ORGANIC CASHEWS OF COLOMBIA y fortalecer al mismo tiempo la economía local.
¡Necesitamos tu apoyo para poder implementar el Paso II, Proyecto Modelo 2017!

Los Llanos Orientales
Algún tiempo atras, Los Llanos estaban cubiertos de bosques naturales centenarios. Debido a la agricultura y ganadería extensivas,  así como la tala de árboles y quemas el bosque ha ido desapareciendo poco a poco. Hoy en día, la región está cubierta con una sabana húmeda. La región está cubierta  por bosques a las orillas de los ríos. En ella se puede encontrar una amplia variedad de flora y fauna.
El Marañón (Cashew)
El marañón es idealmente adecuado para las condiciones locales: cuenta con raíces profundas que le permiten alcanzar y almacenar el agua y los nutrientes suficientes incluso en la estación seca cuando el nivel freático es más profundo.  Al mismo tiempo, este tipo de raíz da al árbol la estabilidad necesaria para aguantar los fuertes vientos en la región. Es a final de cuentas un árbol proveniente de la región que está adaptada perfectamente al ecosistema.
Los productos finales del árbol de marañón son muy versátiles: la almendra de marañón forma parte de la demanda de alimentos a nivel mundial por su alta, nutritiva y sana calidad. Por otra parte se puede hacer uso de la manzana del marañón como tal, del liquido que se extrae de la cáscara de la nuez de marañón y de la madera del árbol.
El árbol produce el fruto a partir del 3er año y alcanza su tamaño final al año 12. Un árbol de marañón puede ser productivo por hasta 30 años.
 
El Acuerdo de Paz
En noviembre de 2016, el acuerdo de paz se concluyó después de cuatro años de negociaciones entre el gobierno colombiano y las FARC. Dando así por terminado el conflicto armado más antiguo en Latinoamérica. 
El presidente Juan Manuel Santos fue galardonado al Premio Nobel de la Paz por sus incansables esfuerzos para lograr la paz en el país. ¡Un momento histórico para Colombia!Ahora es el momento de poner en práctica los contenidos del acuerdo de paz. Para lograr eso es necesario iniciar y apoyar los proyectos sociales y ambientales que siguen una consideración al completa y que así establecen una perspectiva sostenible, sobre todo para las regiones rurales que se vieron afectados fuertemente afectadas por décadas debido a dicho conflicto.

ORGANIC CASHEW OF COLOMBIA: Create Positive Impact
Hello! We are a team of German-Colombian friends working in Hamburg, Bogotá and in the Department of Vichada, Colombia. We want to establish a sustainable mixed plantation with cashew as the main crop at out Finca Cafmato.
With our project ORGANIC CASHEW OF COLOMBIA we want to create a positive impact in a region that has particularly suffered from the decades-long conflict in the Country.
In November 2016 the peace agreement between the Colombian Government and the rebels of the FARC was concluded. Now it´s time to put the contents included in the peace agreement into practice.
This requires projects that are economically viable, social, and eco-friendly and that are led by a holistic approach. With ORGANIC CASHEW OF COLOMBIA we want to prove how projects in a rural place like the Department of Vichada can be successful by integrating the local population and protecting the environment in the Llanos Orientales.
After a pilot project, we want to apply our acquired knowledge and start a 30-hectar model project. Therefore we need to hire first permanent workers for our Finca Cafmato, build up the necessary infrastructure and increase the size of the mixed plantation.
Be part of ORGANIC CASHEW IN COLOMBIA and support us NOW !
LEARN WITH US and create a positive impact to Colombia, the local people and the Llanos Orientales.
Problems in the Department of Vichada
The Department of Vichada was particularly affected by the internal political conflict that lasted until 2012:

Many people were forced out of their villages and fled to the cities
The infrastructure is underdeveloped and there is a huge lack of reliable work and training opportunities, as well as of sustainable cultivating projects
Due to the prohibition of the cultivation of coca that was introduced in the 90s and the shortage of alternative opportunities, the prospect of a secure livelihood for farmers was reduced.
Extensive livestock farming, monocultures, fire erosion as well as the lack of cultivation of vacant spaces and the missing know-how of the farmers resulted in nutrient-poor savannah soils.
Existent overexploitation endangers the centuries old natural forests.

Our Solution: What we can achieve together
With our project, ORGANIC CASHEW OF COLOMBIA, we want to establish a sustainable and eco-friendly mixed plantation focusing on the cultivation of cashews and various native crops in the Department of Vichada in the Llanos Orientales in Colombia.
In the long run, we aim to substantially increase the soil fertility at our Finca Cafmato through our versatile and sustainable soil improvement management and build a flourishing cashew plantation. We intend to protect, reforest and integrate more than 60 hectares of natural forest that expands across our finca.
For the local population, and in particular for the school located in the small village of “El Viento”, we aim to develop workshops focusing on the management of plant nurseries, production of bio compost as well as tree planting and tree maintenance at our finca in order to show them alternatives to cattle farming and coca cultivation.
Our offer of job and training places is designed to provide residents with a long-term perspective in the countryside, which will simultaneously help to maintain peace and incentivize them to return from the overpopulated cities back to the rural areas.
The project initiators have already invested several hundred thousand Euros in the purchase of the finca, in research trips and in the development of the pilot project in 2016. Our next step is to develop a model project in 2017:
With the main goals to hire first permanent workers for our finca, to build the necessary infrastructure and increase the size of the mixed plantation.
Our goal is to benefit all participants: on the one hand, to give the local people a solid and secure perspective and, on the other hand, to create an impact investment opportunity for investors, so that the project financing is guaranteed on a long-term basis.
This is how we work
Step I: Pilot Project 2016
In our tree nursery, we raised the native seedlings which we commissioned from a local Colombian cashew farmer. In October 2016, we planted all the seedlings on two sample surfaces of 2 hectares at our Finca Cafmato.
Step II: Model Project 2017
After the realization of the pilot project at the Finca Cafmato in 2016, we would like to move into the next phase in 2017 by starting a 30-hectar model project applying our acquired knowledge from the pilot project.
With the Model Project, we want to establish a flagship project for the region and lay the foundations for an impact investment model. Experience has shown that one of the most important criteria for a successful project is the generation of income and therefore the financial independence.
Step III: Impact Investment Project on 2018
From 2018 onwards, we plan the successive construction of a mixed cashew plantation of several hundred hectares. Furthermore, we want to support the cashew cultivation in the region by cooperating with local cashew farmers in order to build a processing plant, to market the CASHEWS OF COLOMBIA and therefore strengthen the local economy.
In order to implement Step II, the Model Project, we need your support!

Why we Chose Cashews?
Cultivating cashews works excellent under the local conditions: Thanks to its deep roots, the cashew tree is able to reach sufficient water and nutrients even if ground-water level is low due to dry season. Besides that, the deep roots provide stability in order to stand the strong winds of the region. Cashew trees are native to Colombia and are adapted to the ecosystem.  
The final products of the cashew tree are very diverse: the cashew kernels are highly demanded worldwide. They are a healthy, nutritious, and of high-quality. Furthermore, you can make use of cashew apples, cashew oil and the wood from the cashew trees.
The cashew tree produces its fruits from  the 3rd year onwards and it reaches its final height in the 12th year. A cashew tree can be productive for up to 30 years.
About the Llanos Orientales
The Llanos Region is covered by centuries old forest. Due to extensive land- and livestock farming, as well as steady deforestation and slash-and-burn, the forest is increasingly pushed back. Major parts of the region is covered with wet savanna. The natural forest consists of gallery forests along the river beds with a broad diversity of plants and animals. 
About the Peace Agreement in Colombia
After four years of negotiation between the Colombian Government and the rebels of the FARC, the peace agreement was concluded in November 2016. Therefore, one of the longest armed conflicts in Latin-America came to an end.
President Juan Manuel Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize after his restless attempts of achieving peace for his country. A historical moment for Colombia!
Now it´s time to put the contents included in the peace agreement into practice. This requires economically viable, social, and eco-friendly projects, that are led by an integral approach to shape a sustainable perspective for the rural population that has particularly suffered from the decades long conflict.   
Our Team
We, the initiators of the project, are four German-Colombian friends who want to meet the challenge of realizing this exciting project together with the operating team in Colombia and in Germany. We have different professional backgrounds such as management consulting, project managing for sustainable investments, law, and agricultural and forest science. We are strongly bonded to Colombia for different reasons and share the intention of creating a positive impact in the country. Our objective is to make the best out of the potential of the region Llanos Orientals and to prove how projects in a place like the Department of Vichada can be successful while supporting the local population and protecting the environment. Our diverse areas of expertise help us ensure the success of our multifaceted project.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><font><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Our Routes to Resilience programmes seek to develop sustainability intelligence and promote global leadership in sustainability practice.  Using place-based experiential learning coupled with small group discussions, interactive seminars and learning journeys to sense challenges and witness solutions, we focus on developing confidence, curiousity, courage and commitment to a more sustainable way of being.  By developing  the capacity of educators to act as leaders in sustainability education and by providing young adults with a deep understanding of systems and systems-thinking, an appreciation of the nature of complex problems and the ways in which they can be tackled and developing their sense of mastery in action, we believe we will help develop active, resilient global citizens able to take on the complex challenges of a rapidly changing future.</span></font></p>
<p><font><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Programmes are aimed at youth between 16 and 22 years old who are interested in sustainable development, sustainability, and environmental conservation.  All learning and personal development is put into practice to test knowledge related strategies and develop mastery in practice with students finding their why, defining their what and learning how to address a social challenge in their community through small group social action projects mentored by our faculty and other partners. </span></font></p>

<p><strong>Clase de Chicas</strong></p>
<p>Zanele has chosen to address the Sustainable Development Goals  of Gender Equality, Health and Wellbeing for people, quality education, and reducing inequalities. Her project seeks to support girls between the ages of 13 and 18 living in the gang controlled township of Langa. She strives to help them develop confidence and deal with depression, anxiety about the future, and other related issues.  </p>
<p>Through the project, Zanele hopes to decrease the rate of depression and anxiety among girls and to inspire hope for a good future. Zanele feels that this project will help her have a positive impact on young girls in her community, especially since there are currently no organizations addressing these topics in the community.  </p>
<p>Zanele has gained support from friends, family, and women in the community, as well as from her mentor and teacher, Mrs Faheema Harris. With this support, she has planned lesson topics, sessions, and activities, including finding community role models who have agreed to speak to and guide the girls attending the sessions. At the end of the programme, all the participating girls will receive certificates of completion.  </p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges for Zanele has been finding a venue that is equidistant to the different township communities, making it a space that belongs to everyone. Fortunately, she has been able to find an appropriate venue, at a cost of £80 (ZAR 1600) for the entire programme.   In addition to the cost of venue hire, she will need classroom materials, notebooks for girls to journal in and catering for the afternoon sessions.  Her total request is just £760 (ZAR 14,580) to make her Social Action Project a success! </p>
<p>Zanele spoke about her project on Cape Talk. Listen to her radio interview here <a href=""http://www.capetalk.co.za/articles/317411/classe-de-chica-a-programme-to-help-young-girls-deal-with-depression"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.capetalk.co.za/articles/317411/class...</a> </p>
<p><strong>AA Power</strong></p>
<p>Asekhona and Azola come from Mfuleni and Zwelihle township respectively. Though quite far apart they are passionate about the same problem in their communities –  the lack of clean energy and the ill health that it results in. They have chosen to address the Sustainable Development Goals of affordable and clean energy, sustainable cities, climate change, no poverty, and good health and wellbeing of people.  </p>
<p>Their ‘AA Power’ project promotes a social trend towards environmental care and sustainability in Zwelihle and Mfuleni. The aim is to raise awareness about the benefits of renewable energy on multiple levels (health, wealth, welfare, climate, pollution) and the disadvantages of unclean energy sources especially in the home. They are looking at mobilising the community to make the switch to solar energy and are seeking to identify ways in which savings schemes can support community wide uptake of solar. </p>
<p>Their primary means of advocacy is through their ‘Energy Freedom Manifesto’, which they have compiled as an information and awareness brochure to highlight the benefits of solar for human and environmental health, and campaign for reduced ‘Energy Poverty’. They have begun visiting homes in their communities to share their message, and have been surprised by how many people are living in ‘Energy Poverty’ – cooking indoors with poisonous gas and poor ventilation, enduring regular power outages, and more!  </p>
<p>They are also about to complete an energy audit at the Tikkun Centre in Mfuleni in order to then undertake a feasibility study as to how this centre may be equipped with solar energy courses.  With support from the Terra Firma Academy a they have been given the opportunity to attend and be certified in Solar PV Feasibility Assessment programme and have received matched funding for this, but still need to cover £230 (ZAR 4400)!!  </p>
<p>In addition to covering the cost of the programme, the boys need funding for data/airtime, travel, and printing for the dissemination of their message. Considering this, they need a total of £1,030 (ZAR 19,750) to succeed in reducing ‘Energy Poverty’ in their communities!  </p>
<p><strong>El Natural</strong></p>
<p>Rafeeqah, Musa and Storm from Christel House in Philippi have chosen to address the Sustainable Development Goals – no poverty, zero hunger, good health and wellbeing, quality education, sustainable cities and communities, responsible consumption and production, and life on land. Their project will have three components – </p>
<p>Production – an organic food garden </p>
<p>Provision – a soup kitchen </p>
<p>Education – workshops and conferences </p>
<p>Think of it as 3 projects in one though they are all working together and have engaged the school interact society to assist, using the establishment of the garden as a key learning project as well. </p>
<p>Storm has dedicated his time to growing a small-scale organic garden, which will produce vegetables, herbs and fruits. Students at his school, where the garden is located, will get involved as part of their community service. Storm wants to show people that produce can be grown without damaging the environment! </p>
<p>Musa is using Storm’s garden as a real-life example in her workshops. She wants to organise educational conferences and workshops that relate to the importance of the sustainable development goals. Attendees will learn to grow their own organic produce, cheaply and efficiently. Musa’s workshops on creating your own organic garden at home will help to reduce food poverty in her community, whilst positively impacting the environment. </p>
<p>Rafeeqah wants to show people that organically grown produce can also be used to make tasty and nutritional meals, through her own soup kitchen! She will use produce from Storm’s garden to provide meals to the disadvantaged community adjacent to the school. She has also committed to composting all waste – creating a circular economy of production, consumption and recycling!  </p>
<p>Storm, Musa and Rafeeqah really want to succeed in their project, and show other people the viability of organic farming. Their first step in achieving this is to attend an Organic Gardening course with Soil for Life, so they can learn how to grow great produce and get ideas for their workshops and conference. The programme will cost £347 (ZAR 6,600). The group will also need funding for stationary and catering, meaning that they’ll need £940 (ZAR 18,030) in total!</p>

Storm, Musa and Rafeeqah really want to succeed in their project, and show other people the viability of organic farming. Their first step in achieving this is to attend an Organic Gardening course with Soil for Life, so they can learn how to grow great produce and get ideas for their workshops and conference. The programme will cost £347 (ZAR 6,600). The group will also need funding for stationary and catering, meaning that they’ll need £940 (ZAR 18,030) in total!

La escribió́ imaginándose lo que Fermina Daza le hubiera contestado a él si lo quisiera tanto como aquella criatura desamparada quería a su pretendiente. Dos días después, desde luego, tuvo que escribir también la replica del novio con la caligrafía, el estilo y la clase de amor que le había atribuido en la primera carta, y fue así́ como terminó comprometido en una correspondencia febril consigo mismo.

<h3><i>La fuerza del amor</i></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Vale la pena recordar algunos movimientos en los que se ha demostrado la fuerza del amor; uno de ellos inspirado en el personaje imaginario de Julieta de la obra “Romeo y Julieta” en el cual hoy en día deben disponer de 15 mujeres que la personifican como símbolo del amor, dedicadas exclusivamente a responder las cartas que llegan diariamente de todo el mundo a la ciudad de Verona solicitando consejos del corazón. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Otro caso es el de los “Candados del Amor” derivado de la obra literaria: “Tengo ganas de ti” de Federico Moccia, en donde las parejas cierran un candado en los puentes y arrojan las llaves al río significando que su amor queda sellado eternamente, lo que ha generado serios inconvenientes en diferentes plataformas del mundo por el peso que tienen que soportar de los miles y en algunos casos millones de cerrojos, razón por la cual han debido retirarlos de los puentes del Arzobispado y de Las Artes en París; lo que nos conduce a pensar que si la fuerza del amor es tal que ha llegado a amenazar tan cimentadas estructuras, porque no utilizarla en ejercicios más loables como la reforestación de la cuenca del río Magdalena. </span></p>

Now, due to climate change and deforestation, trees have released the land, the river has silted and the ship “New Fidelity” in which this eternal love was sailing has been aground. This situation has turned the couples days humdrum because unlike when they were sailing, now they can´t enjoy the thrilling natural and cultural life that flourishes along the waterfront geography. Such dreariness is ending with the love for which Florentino Ariza waited 53 years, 7 months and 11 days with their nights. How right his uncle Leon XII was, when he said:</div>

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Another case is that of the “Love Padlocks” derivable from the literary work “I desire you”, by Federico Moccia, where the couples close a padlock on the bridges and throw the keys into the river meaning that their love will be eternally seal.

Ahora, debido al cambio climático y la deforestación, los árboles han soltado la tierra, el río se ha sedimentado y el barco “Nueva Fidelidad” en el que navegaba este eterno amor ha quedado encallado, tal situación ha vuelto los días de la pareja rutinarios, pues a diferencia de cuando navegaban hoy no pueden disfrutar de la emocionante vida natural y cultural que florece en toda la geografía ribereña, tal monotonía está acabando con el amor por el cual Florentino Ariza esperó 53 años, 7 meses y 11 días con sus noches; cuanta razón tenía su tío León XII cuando le decía:

“Sin navegación fluvial no hay amor” 
Es por ello que necesitamos de tu ayuda con el fin de reforestar la cuenca del río Magdalena para así retener la tierra, mejorar el hábitat de las especies y brindar un bello paisaje, lo que permitirá a la pareja de enamorados seguir navegando un río Magdalena que gracias a tu contribución volverá a ser el lugar de fantasía que algún día fue. 
Al contribuir con la siembra de árboles avivarás el amor de la pareja, que al igual que el tuyo crecerá  y se fortalecerá a medida que tú árbol crezca pues su fruto es precisamente: EL AMOR.

 
 
59.110 millones de arboles


Gabriel García Márquez escribió en el año de 1981 para el diario El País de España “La rehabilitación del Magdalena solo será posible con el esfuerzo continuado e intenso de por lo menos cuatro generaciones conscientes: un siglo entero realizando la siembra técnica de 59.110 millones de árboles"", llamado que de haberse atendido en tal época estaríamos cumpliendo en estos momentos 35 años en labores de reforestación, un poco más de un tercio del siglo mencionado, por lo que es apremiante empezar dicha labor cuanto antes, no lo podemos seguir postergando, ninguna ayuda es poca puesto que con cualquiera de ellas sembraremos árboles y cada vez la meta será más alcanzable.

Además de ésto demostraremos que es posible desarrollar proyectos donde no solo se obtiene una rentabilidad económica, sino también una rentabilidad ambiental, cultural y social; ambiental por estar contribuyendo con la reforestación de la cuenca del río Magdalena, cultural por estar rindiendo un homenaje a la obra del Nobel, inspirada a su vez en la emocionante vida cultural que florece en la geografía ribereña, y social porque son las comunidades locales las que se beneficiarán de una actividad radicalmente opuesta a la que algunos aún realizan en éstos bosques tropicales, como es la deforestación.




 
El río de la vida está muriendo

Periódico El Espectador: ¡A salvar el Magdalena!
WWF. Navegar o no navegar: los dilemas del Magdalena 
Río Magdalena: El protagonista
El río Magdalena, más que un simple escenario o telón de fondo, es un verdadero protagonista en la obra de Gabriel García Márquez, tal como lo fue en su vida, pues él mismo lo recorrió varias veces en su años de estudio, dichos viajes los describió como una maravillosa experiencia, a bordo de buques repletos de estudiantes con los cuales se sentaban a ver pasar la vida, aprendiendo de ella ""más y mejor"", por lo tanto, si el barco se retrasaba algunos días por un encallamiento u otra circunstancia, no había ningún inconveniente, pues la fiesta de la vida se prolongaba y los capitanes de la época te elaboraban y sellaban una justificada excusa por la demora.

 
Cartas de amor
Si bien recuerdas, Florentino Ariza se ha caracterizado por escribir alentadoras cartas de amor con un gran ""poder de deslumbramiento"", con las cuales ha ayudado a perpetuar la unión de abundantes parejas, alcanzando a reunir tantos escritos que cuando tuvo los recursos propios para publicar un libro le costó trabajo admitir la realidad de que habían pasado de moda; te imaginarás la felicidad y la ilusión que le embarga en estos momentos al saber que sus cartas de amor han recobrado importancia y podrá obtener de ellas un inmenso beneficio, ya que serán su compensación a los enamorados del mundo que contribuyan con la reforestación de la cuenca del río Magdalena.

“Su recuerdo más grato de aquella época fue el de una muchachita muy tímida, casi una niña, que le pidió́ temblando escribirle una respuesta para una carta irresistible que acababa de recibir, y que Florentino Ariza reconoció́ como escrita por él la tarde anterior. La contestó con un estilo distinto, acorde con la emoción y la edad de la niña, y con una letra que también pareciera de ella, pues sabía fingir una escritura para cada ocasión según el carácter de cada quien. La escribió́ imaginándose lo que Fermina Daza le hubiera contestado a él si lo quisiera tanto como aquella criatura desamparada quería a su pretendiente. Dos días después, desde luego, tuvo que escribir también la replica del novio con la caligrafía, el estilo y la clase de amor que le había atribuido en la primera carta, y fue así́ como terminó comprometido en una correspondencia febril consigo mismo. Antes de un mes, ambos fueron por separado a darle las gracias por lo que él mismo había propuesto en la carta del novio y aceptado con devoción en la respuesta de la chica: iban a casarse”. El Amor en los Tiempos del Cólera.
 
La felicidad estará de moda

Si bien ya se han descrito algunos beneficios racionales y emocionales del proyecto, debemos mencionar adicionalmente que en los años en que Gabriel García Márquez se encontraba escribiendo “El Amor en los Tiempos del Cólera” manifestaba que su propósito era: ""Poner de moda la felicidad"", análogamente este proyecto busca generar éste mismo intangible emocional en todos los ""enamorados, del mundo"" que contribuyan con la causa así como en todas las personas que participen de una u otra forma en su realización.


 
5000 árboles
Nuestro objetivo es sembrar 5000 árboles nativos en el Magdalena Central Colombiano, a través de cien familias campesinas lideradas por Chavita; todas las ayudas contribuirán con la siembra de éstos árboles cubriendo los costos de gestión y operación en que se incurren generando además un beneficio económico para las comunidades locales que se encargaran de la siembra y cuidado de ellos; sin embargo y dado el propósito a largo plazo que debemos alcanzar, se busca dotar al proyecto de una plataforma tecnológica que nos permita acceder a una masa global de usuarios, propiciando así su escalabilidad. 

Por lo anterior, si logramos  la meta de US$100.000.oo no solo habremos iniciado la labor de reforestación en la cuenca del río Magdalena, sino también obtener unas utilidades que se invertirán en tecnologías de la información y las comunicaciones.  En caso de lograr la meta parcialmente, los fondos recogidos serán destinados a la siembra de árboles cubriendo los costos de gestión, así como los de operación y utilidad para las comunidades locales.


 
Turismo literario... naturalmente
En nuestro ejercicio profesional en Colombia y con el objetivo de diseñar productos turísticos innovadores y diferenciados, hemos desarrollado la línea de turismo literario donde sobresale nuestro Nobel Gabriel García Márquez y su obra, en la cual nuestra exhuberante naturaleza cobra vida. Por su parte “Chavita” desde su ejercicio como gestora ambiental, es una líder innata con reconocidos procesos de repoblamiento y reforestación en diferentes escenarios naturales del país, algunos de los cuales son protagonistas de la obra literaria del Nobel, como lo es en éste caso el Río Magdalena.

La fuerza del amor
Vale la pena recordar algunos movimientos en los que se ha demostrado la fuerza del amor; uno de ellos inspirado en el personaje imaginario de Julieta de la obra “Romeo y Julieta” en el cual hoy en día deben disponer de 15 mujeres que la personifican como símbolo del amor, dedicadas exclusivamente a responder las cartas que llegan diariamente de todo el mundo a la ciudad de Verona solicitando consejos del corazón. 
Otro caso es el de los “Candados del Amor” derivado de la obra literaria: “Tengo ganas de ti” de Federico Moccia, en donde las parejas cierran un candado en los puentes y arrojan las llaves al río significando que su amor queda sellado eternamente, lo que ha generado serios inconvenientes en diferentes plataformas del mundo por el peso que tienen que soportar de los miles y en algunos casos millones de cerrojos, razón por la cual han debido retirarlos de los puentes del Arzobispado y de Las Artes en París; lo que nos conduce a pensar que si la fuerza del amor es tal que ha llegado a amenazar tan cimentadas estructuras, porque no utilizarla en ejercicios más loables como la reforestación de la cuenca del río Magdalena. 




""Los días siguientes fueron calurosos e interminables. El río se volvió turbio y se fue haciendo cada vez más estrecho, y en vez de la maraña de árboles colosales que había asombrado a Florentino Ariza en su primer viaje, había llanuras calcinadas, desechos de selvas enteras, por la noche no los despertaban los cantos de sirenas de los manatíes en los playones, en lugar de la algarabía de los loros y el escándalo de los micos invisibles que en otro tiempo aumentaban el bochorno del medio día, solo quedaba el vasto silencio de la tierra arrasada"". El Amor en los Tiempos del Cólera.

For Mónica, of course.

Evoking the story “Love in the Time of cholera”, you will remember that the only way in which Florentino Ariza and Fermina Daza can live their idyllic love is sailing the river Magdalena round trip for Lifetime. Now, due to climate change and deforestation, trees have released the land, the river has silted and the ship “New Fidelity” in which this eternal love was sailing has been aground. This situation has turned the couples days humdrum because unlike when they were sailing, now they can´t enjoy the thrilling natural and cultural life that flourishes along the waterfront geography. Such dreariness is ending with the love for which Florentino Ariza waited 53 years, 7 months and 11 days with their nights. How right his uncle Leon XII was, when he said:
 

“Without fluvial sailing there is no love” 
It is therefore that we need your help with the purpose of reforest the river Magdalena basin so the soil can be hold, the species habitat can be improve and to offer a beautiful landscape, which will allow the loving couple to keep sailing a river Magdalena that thanks to your contribution will be again the fantasy place it used to be.


Contributing with the tree sowing you will stoke the couple´s love, which like yours, will grow up as your tree grows because its fruit is precisely: LOVE. 


 
59.110 million trees

In 1981, Gabriel García Márquez wrote for the newspaper El Pais, in Spain: “The rehabilitation of the Magdalena will only be possible with the continuous and deep effort of by at least four aware generations: a whole century doing the technical sowing of 59.110 million trees”. A call that if it had been heeded at that moment we would be meeting at this time 35 years of sowing labour, just a bit more than a third of the mention century. This is why it is so imperative to start as soon as possible, we can´t keep deferring it. Each aid is important because with all of it we will sow trees and every time the goal will be more attainable.
 

 
Besides, we will demonstrate that it is possible to develop projects where not only you can obtain profitability, but also an environment, cultural and social profit. Environmental because we will be contributing with the tree sowing of the Magdalena´s river basin; cultural because we will be paying tribute to the Nobel´s work, inspired at the same time in the thrilling cultural life that flourishes in the waterfront geography. And social because it’s the local communities the ones who will be benefit from an activity completely opposite to that that some of them still do in these tropical forests, as deforestation.
 
 




 
The river of life is dying

River Magdalena: The protagonist


The river Magdalena, more than a simple scenario or background curtain, is a real main character in Gabriel García Márquez work, as it was in his life, since he roamed it several times during his studying years. These trips described them as a wonderful experience aboard ships full of students with whom he sat down to see life pass through, learning from it “more and better”. Thus if the ship had any delay for several days because of an aground or any other circumstance, there was no problem because the feast of life would extend and the captains of those days would elaborate and stamped an excused absence for the delay. 


 
Love letters

If you well remember, Florentino Ariza has been characterized for writing encouraging love letters with a great “dazzling power”, with which he has helped to perpetuate the love of plentiful couples, reaching so many writings that when he had his own means to published a book it was hard for him to admit the reality that they were no longer trendy. Can you imagine the happiness and illusion that overwhelms him now to know that his love letters have recovered importance and will be able to receive a great benefit from them, due to that they will be his compensation to all the world lovers that contribute with the sowing of the Magdalena´s river basin.
 

 


“
His fondest memory from that time was that of a very timid little lady, almost a girl, that trembling asked him to write an answer for an irresistible letter she had just receive, and that Florentino Ariza recognized as written by him the evening before. He answered it with a different style, according with the emotion and the age of the girl, and with a letter that also resemble hers, because he knew how to make believe a handwriting for each occasion according to the character of each one. He wrote it imagining what Fermina Daza would have answer him if she love him so much like that helpless creature love her wooer.

Before a month, both went on their own to thank him for what he had proposed in the boyfriends letter and accepted with passion in the answer of the girl: they were going to get married”. Love in the Times of cholera. 

 

 


Happiness will be in fashion

While several rational and emotional benefits of the project have been described, we must also mentioned that in those years in which Gabriel García Márquez was writing “Love in Times of cholera” he said that his purpose was to put Happiness trendy. Similarly this project seeks to generate this same emotional intangibly in all those in love around the world that contribute with the cause as well as in all those people that participate in one or other form in accomplishing it.

Our target is to plant 5000 native trees at the Colombian Central Magdalena, through 100 peasant families headed by ""Chavita""; all your help will contribute with the tree sowing, covering administration and operation fees in which one incurs generating by the way an economical benefit for the local communities who will be in charge of the sowing and care. Nevertheless and given the long term purpose we must achieve, we are looking forward to provide the project with a technological platform that will allow us to access to a global mass of users providing with it its scalability. 

By the above, if we reach the goal of 100.000 dollars we will have not only started the sow tree labors in the Magdalena´s river basin, but also gain some utility that will be invested in technologies for information and communications.  In case the goal is partially achieved, the funds collected will be destined to the tree sowing covering the administration fees as well as those for operation and utility for the local communities.
 
Literary tourism... naturally
In our professional exercise in Colombia and with the purpose of designing innovative and differentiator  touristic products, we have develop the literary tourism line where our Nobel Gabriel García Márquez and his work stands out, In which our exuberant nature comes to life. For its part ""Chavita"" since its exercise as an environmental manager, is an innate leader with recognized processes of repopulation and reforestation in different natural scenarios of the country, some of which are protagonists of the literary work of the Nobel, as it is in this case The Magdalena River.

The literary tourism routes in Colombia
""Chavita"" environmental work
Literary tourism: Legacy of our proposal
 

The strength of love
It´s worth it to remember some of the movements where the strength of love has been demonstrated. One of them inspired on the imaginary character of Juliet from the work Romeo and Juliet, in which now a days there must be 15 ladies that embodied her as a love symbol, exclusively dedicated to answer the letters that arrived daily to the city of Verona from all over the world asking for heart advices. 
Another case is that of the “Love Padlocks” derivable from the literary work “I desire you”, by Federico Moccia, where the couples close a padlock on the bridges and throw the keys into the river meaning that their love will be eternally seal. This has produced serious obstacles in different platforms around the world because of the weigh they have to hold up from the thousands and millions of steel bolts, having to make the decision of removing them as in the case of the Archbishops and The Arts bridges in Paris. This is what makes us think that if the strength of love is such that has threatened cemented structures, why not then use such strength in more commendable exercises as the tree sowing in the Magdalena´s river basin.

“The following days were hot and endless. The river turned muddy and became more and more narrow, and instead of the undergrowth of colossal trees that used to amaze Florentino Ariza during his first trip, there were calcined plains, rubbished of whole jungles, during the night they were not awaken by the mermaid songs from the sea cows on the beaches, instead of the parrot gabble and the scandal of the invisible monkeys that once boost the midday sultriness, it only remained the vast silence from the scorched earth”. Love in Times of cholera.
¡Help us to spread our campaign!
The sow trees will also allow you
to crop its fruit:
""Love""
 
This project is a tribute to the Nobel Gabriel García Márquez and his literary work.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We will manufacture Green Septic Systems in the United States which will eventually put an end to sewage production by the entire population of our planet. Imagine a world which is free of sewage production at all in the near future! GS Systems use heat to take away the moister from sewage and turns it into pulverized dust! This project will also help create jobs in the U.S!</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Tom F. Saat</p>

We will manufacture Green Septic Systems in the United States which will eventually put an end to sewage production by the entire population of our planet. Imagine a world which is free of sewage production at all in the near future! GS Systems use heat to take away the moister from sewage and turns it into pulverized dust! This project will also help create jobs in the U.S!
 
Hi, my name is Tom F. Saat
All my life I always wanted to improve things for the world. When I was in Junior High School, I wanted to produce energy from water. I mixed water with any chemical I could get to see if it will turn water into an energy source. Later on in my life, I built a small steel box which can turn water into hydrogen energy by separating Oxygen and Hydrogen. The technology is out there but is not used as much as our demand requires. Hydrogen is more powerful than natural gas or gasoline, does not produce smoke and only produces water which can be used over and over again. Learning all of this from working on the Hydrogen unit allowed me to continue to pursue other sources of energy .
My next project is to eliminate sewage that is produced every day in order to make the world more sustainable. I built a mechanism and applied for a patent to turn sewage into pulverized dust.
It can be easily installed into mobile, motor and tiny homes. It will not require the user to unload sewage at stop stations. It can also replace the city sewage lines and conventional septic tanks at homes and buildings in the near future. Our rivers, drinking wells, oceans and planet will be protected from sewage and its negative effects. With this unit, we will leave a cleaner world for our future generations.
Our contributors will be a part of this new global movement. We will all be the pioneers for a cleaner world.
We will annihilate sewage from our planet!

<p>The <a href=""http://www.santafewatershed.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Santa Fe Watershed Association</a> (SFWA)
has worked tirelessly since 1997 to protect and restore the health and vibrancy
of the Santa Fe River and its watershed for the benefit of people and the
environment.  Through education, restoration,
stewardship, and advocacy, the SFWA is achieving this mission. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1299237/files/20150316103636-GAB_1876.jpg?1426527396"" src="""" style=""width: 559.659367396594px; height: 371px;""/></p>
<p>For over 12 years, the SFWA has been
taking care of 18 miles of the Santa Fe River corridor through its
<a href=""http://www.santafewatershed.org/adopt-the-river/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Adopt-the-River</a> program in partnership with the City and County of Santa Fe, along
with local businesses, foundations and community members and volunteers.  <b>Over 1 million pounds of trash have been
removed from the river bed - like pulling out 40 school buses from the river! </b>Other
restoration efforts like removing non-native elms and planting native
cottonwood trees have transformed the Santa Fe River through the
Adopt-the-River program! </p>

<p><b>Santa Fe’s arroyos</b>, however, which feed
directly into the Santa Fe River and have been largely neglected, are <b>filled
with trash</b>, and have been <b>left to erode</b>. 
Their soils, neighboring banks and channels, are slipping away, setting
the scene for dangerous storm events and floods.  They need rescuing – now – trash needs to be
removed, and water needs to slow down on its way through – to protect the
people and environment, and to help our precious water infiltrate and join the
groundwater to replenish our vital aquifer.</p>
<p></p>

impact of this work cannot be overestimated, especially as the climate becomes
drier and hotter.  Our watershed is life
to Santa Fe, and together we can help the arroyos become what they should be.<p></p> </div> <div> <h3><b>What we will do to rescue the arroyos with your help</b></h3> <p></p>
<p>Your donations will
enable us to develop the <b>Adopt an Arroyo</b> program, based on our highly successful
<b>Adopt the River</b> program.  There are <b>over
80 miles of arroyo</b> in and around the City of Santa Fe.  Previous work by staff at the SFWA identified
the arroyos most in need of intervention. We will start working within 5
reaches of these arroyos, developing volunteer teams to adopt the reaches, enlisting
sponsors to provide sustainable funding for them, and establishing management
plans for each reach to counteract erosion with simple measures like one-rock
dams, Zuni bowls and waddles.  </p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>In order to achieve
this goal, <b>we need $10,000</b> to cover the development stage of the program and
the first year of work in the arroyos. 
We can then develop partnerships with sponsors for the long-term running
of the program and its expansion to include more arroyo reaches.</p>
What happens if we don’t
reach $10,000? Not to worry! We will rescue as many arroyos as we can! We have
designed our program to be easily scaled up or down depending on funding. <b>Each
$2,000 we raise will cover the rescue of one arroyo</b> <b>reach</b>.  The more funding we receive, the more arroyos
we can rescue! </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The <b>Adopt-An-Arroyo</b>
program will strive to clean up the intrinsic and necessary drainages by
removing litter and providing a safe place for people to recreate in and
around.  Additionally, any soil erosion
reduction measures that can be implemented will reduce sedimentation and
excessive flooding in the entire watershed. 
Importantly, the repeated presence of the volunteers can lead to an
“Ownership” of the arroyo by the Steward Team, providing a real relationship
with our arroyos and the Santa Fe River. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1291273/files/20150312203440-healthy_arroyo_n.JPG?1426217680"" src="""" style=""width: 577.5px; height: 385px;""/></p>Based upon the
successful Adopt-the-River program, the Adopt an Arroyo program would designate
a Steward Team of volunteers whose mission it is to monitor the health of
arroyos in the Santa Fe River watershed, removing debris, and advising the SFWA
as to potentially damaging situations within each arroyo.  Coupled with the Steward Team is a Sponsor
entity who contributes the funding to provide for the on-going management and
potentially necessary restoration measures. </div> <div> <h3></h3>
<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The path to arroyo rescue
success can be rocky and filled with quick sand at times.  One year of funding won’t be enough to make a
difference to the long-term health of our arroyos – we need a program that can
sustain itself and be in it for the long haul. 
</p>
<p>We at the Santa Fe
Watershed Association are well equipped to deal with this challenge and
overcome it.  Our Adopt-the-River program
is in its 12<sup>th</sup> year and sustains itself in large part
thanks to Sponsors of the program that we have developed over the years, many
of which have supported us since the program’s inception.  Adopt-the-River is well loved by all
involved, and we will work to set up a similar support structure for Adopt an
Arroyo within a year of our crowdfunding campaign. </p>

<p>Besides
picking up trash at least 5 times per year, the Stewards report on any human

scenarios.  There will be an initial training
Session for all Steward Teams as well as regular “check-in’s” to monitor the

The Santa Fe Watershed Association (SFWA)
has worked tirelessly since 1997 to protect and restore the health and vibrancy
of the Santa Fe River and its watershed for the benefit of people and the
environment.  Through education, restoration,
stewardship, and advocacy, the SFWA is achieving this mission. 


For over 12 years, the SFWA has been
taking care of 18 miles of the Santa Fe River corridor through its
Adopt-the-River program in partnership with the City and County of Santa Fe, along
with local businesses, foundations and community members and volunteers.  Over 1 million pounds of trash have been
removed from the river bed - like pulling out 40 school buses from the river! Other
restoration efforts like removing non-native elms and planting native
cottonwood trees have transformed the Santa Fe River through the
Adopt-the-River program! 


Santa Fe’s arroyos, however, which feed
directly into the Santa Fe River and have been largely neglected, are filled
with trash, and have been left to erode. 
Their soils, neighboring banks and channels, are slipping away, setting
the scene for dangerous storm events and floods.  They need rescuing – now – trash needs to be
removed, and water needs to slow down on its way through – to protect the
people and environment, and to help our precious water infiltrate and join the
groundwater to replenish our vital aquifer.


The
impact of this work cannot be overestimated, especially as the climate becomes
drier and hotter.  Our watershed is life
to Santa Fe, and together we can help the arroyos become what they should be.   What we will do to rescue the arroyos with your help 
Your donations will
enable us to develop the Adopt an Arroyo program, based on our highly successful
Adopt the River program.  There are over
80 miles of arroyo in and around the City of Santa Fe.  Previous work by staff at the SFWA identified
the arroyos most in need of intervention. We will start working within 5
reaches of these arroyos, developing volunteer teams to adopt the reaches, enlisting
sponsors to provide sustainable funding for them, and establishing management
plans for each reach to counteract erosion with simple measures like one-rock
dams, Zuni bowls and waddles.  






In order to achieve
this goal, we need $10,000 to cover the development stage of the program and
the first year of work in the arroyos. 
We can then develop partnerships with sponsors for the long-term running
of the program and its expansion to include more arroyo reaches.
What happens if we don’t
reach $10,000? Not to worry! We will rescue as many arroyos as we can! We have
designed our program to be easily scaled up or down depending on funding. Each
$2,000 we raise will cover the rescue of one arroyo reach.  The more funding we receive, the more arroyos
we can rescue!   
Gifts you get 
Not only will you be a
pioneer in arroyo rescue, but you get access to our exclusive and exciting
perks! These include our brand new Water is Life t-shirt (available in navy blue or charcoal, in men's and women's sizes), tickets to our
much-anticipated launch of the River Brew Hefeweizen beer in partnership with
Santa Fe Brewing, at Del Charro (June 10th from 5pm-7pm) featuring music by a local talent, snacks and great company, a commemorative Klean Kanteen stainless steel pint glass with
our logo (to be received full of River Brew Hefeweizen at the beer launch), an exclusive MP3 download of a La Llorona
arroyo story as told by local legend Joe Hayes for our supporters, opportunities to hike and dine
with SFWA staff, and an arroyo Reach sponsorship with your own personalized
sign next to an arroyo!


More on the Klean Kanteen stainless steel pint from their website:
""Put down the plastic and pick up a pint―steel that is. Made of 18/8, food-grade stainless steel, the 16oz Kanteen Steel Pint Cup is durable, reusable, and won't break like glass, or fill the garbage like the ubiquitous red cup. Multi-use and ready for any occasion, use them for parties, camping, boating, or hiking deep into the backcountry. Cheers, to the beginning of the end of the plastic cup!""

 
Take a closer look at our brand-new Water is Life Tshirt - trust us, it looks just as great in charcoal! 



The Impact

The Adopt-An-Arroyo
program will strive to clean up the intrinsic and necessary drainages by
removing litter and providing a safe place for people to recreate in and
around.  Additionally, any soil erosion
reduction measures that can be implemented will reduce sedimentation and
excessive flooding in the entire watershed. 
Importantly, the repeated presence of the volunteers can lead to an
“Ownership” of the arroyo by the Steward Team, providing a real relationship
with our arroyos and the Santa Fe River. 

Based upon the
successful Adopt-the-River program, the Adopt an Arroyo program would designate
a Steward Team of volunteers whose mission it is to monitor the health of
arroyos in the Santa Fe River watershed, removing debris, and advising the SFWA
as to potentially damaging situations within each arroyo.  Coupled with the Steward Team is a Sponsor
entity who contributes the funding to provide for the on-going management and
potentially necessary restoration measures.   
Risks and Challenges

The path to arroyo rescue
success can be rocky and filled with quick sand at times.  One year of funding won’t be enough to make a
difference to the long-term health of our arroyos – we need a program that can
sustain itself and be in it for the long haul. 

We at the Santa Fe
Watershed Association are well equipped to deal with this challenge and
overcome it.  Our Adopt-the-River program
is in its 12th year and sustains itself in large part
thanks to Sponsors of the program that we have developed over the years, many
of which have supported us since the program’s inception.  Adopt-the-River is well loved by all
involved, and we will work to set up a similar support structure for Adopt an
Arroyo within a year of our crowdfunding campaign. 



Spread the word and join the movement as an Arroyo Steward 
We understand that not
everyone can contribute to causes with dollar amounts – there are so many other
ways you can help!  Make as much noise
about our Arroyo Rescue as you can – share our campaign with all your friends
and colleagues or become an Arroyo Steward! 
We will need dedicated
Stewards to adopt Arroyo Reaches, and your contribution in time and work is the
most valuable contribution of all.  Get
in touch with our Volunteer Coordinator to let us know you want to be part of
our clean-up and restoration crew!
Besides
picking up trash at least 5 times per year, the Stewards report on any human
activities, any dangerous utility situations, and any unusual erosion
scenarios.  There will be an initial training
Session for all Steward Teams as well as regular “check-in’s” to monitor the
morale of the team.  In order to
acknowledge the Steward Team, there will be a sign prominently posted along the
reach of the arroyo acknowledging the Team’s commitment.More on the Santa Fe Watershed AssociationFind

The founders, Min Ameen and Akshay Roongta, have now hit the limit to what can be achieved with part-time engagement, and are looking to come on board full-time come March 2015. We are also starting to hire a small team for design, research and operations.<div>
<br/><p>This is the most crucial moment yet in the life of our start-up. The mountains we climb in the next few months will take us over the tipping point of our organisation into the full swing of the solution. <b>Implementing a pilot over the next few months will prove to interested organisations that with long term funding, we can change the face of water in India.</b> We have established July 2015 as the horizon to raise about $160,000 in funding through grants and investment for the longer term, given that we’ve stepped up efforts now. You can help us get there and be one of the original supporters of a company that will go international. </p>
<br/><h3>OUR JOURNEY</h3>
<p>In October 2012 we dreamed of a cleaner world, free of plastic waste. We started as activists campaigning to ‘Ban the Bottle’, lobbying the Pondicherry government to ban the sale of packaged drinking water. Our friends in local social and ecological organisations urged us to create viable alternatives before pursuing action through policy.</p>
<p>A few months later we sat down to design a simple solution that filtered water on site, tested water quality in real-time and allowed a shopkeeper to sell water to consumers bringing their own bottles.We started with a stand-alone water kiosk.<br/></p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1136002/files/20150107035901-kiosk_fotos_for_indiegogo_campaign.jpg?1420631941"" src="""" style=""""/><p></p>
<p>In August 2013, our co-founder and CEO Min, was selected to be part of Villgro’s Entrepreneur-in-residence programme. Their guidance finely tuned our operations to be more dynamic and we applied the structural principles of a lean startup: conducting continuous experiments in the field to gain insight into consumer and the market to perfect the product long before its launch. </p>
<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FCosW0f_zcGY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DCosW0f_zcGY&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FCosW0f_zcGY%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/>Our early experiments were a window into consumers thoughts on drinking unpackaged water and carrying their own bottles. As we tested our stand-alone kiosk, looking at the role of marketing campaigns, and price in uptake, we realised convenience was of the upmost importance to users. If we wanted people to buy unpackaged water, they would need to have easy access wherever they were.  <br/><p>With the kiosk, capital costs were too high and and logistics too complicated. We needed a cheaper, simpler and more mobile idea that could fit in any common shop so users could refill anywhere.</p>
<p>We pivoted and focused on modular vending machines that would allow us to quickly build a dense network in a city, fully optimising convenience for consumers. Fuelled by the funding provided to us by Villgro and grant money we won through an IIHS competition, we launched full throttle into developing the vending machine. </p>

<h3>THE PROTOTYPE &amp; THE PILOT</h3>
<p>Working closely with partners over the last 8 months, we have developed a working prototype that transforms a standard bubble top dispenser into a water ATM. The consumer puts in coins, and the machine  dispenses filtered water. A small display on the front shows the results of testing the  water real-time to ensure that it has been through a functioning RO system.</p>

</div></div>","Recognising the threat of polluted water and plastic waste to health and the environment in India, Amrutdhara was formed to tackle these issues. A technological solution that could be implemented in the market was designed in the form of a water vending machine where users could refill their bottles. When we cut out the bottle, we found we could cut costs, and offer what consumers had really wanted all along, clean water, at half the price per liter of bottled water making safe drinking water more affordable for all. We envision a network of refill stations starting in our town of Pondicherry and expanding across India, making it easy to give up buying bottled water forever.HOW FAR WE’VE COMEWe’ve designed and built a prototype for a vending machine that will enable shopkeepers in public spaces to sell drinking water to consumers with refillable bottles. When we overcome our limited resources, we plan to launch a pilot in Pondicherry over the next 3 months.Founders Min and Akshay talking to citizens about their attitudes towards water.We’re a growing, close-knit team based mainly out of Auroville, India and have been straining to promote this solution with minimal funding and without wages since early 2013. The founders, Min Ameen and Akshay Roongta, have now hit the limit to what can be achieved with part-time engagement, and are looking to come on board full-time come March 2015. We are also starting to hire a small team for design, research and operations.
This is the most crucial moment yet in the life of our start-up. The mountains we climb in the next few months will take us over the tipping point of our organisation into the full swing of the solution. Implementing a pilot over the next few months will prove to interested organisations that with long term funding, we can change the face of water in India. We have established July 2015 as the horizon to raise about $160,000 in funding through grants and investment for the longer term, given that we’ve stepped up efforts now. You can help us get there and be one of the original supporters of a company that will go international. 
OUR JOURNEY
In October 2012 we dreamed of a cleaner world, free of plastic waste. We started as activists campaigning to ‘Ban the Bottle’, lobbying the Pondicherry government to ban the sale of packaged drinking water. Our friends in local social and ecological organisations urged us to create viable alternatives before pursuing action through policy.
A few months later we sat down to design a simple solution that filtered water on site, tested water quality in real-time and allowed a shopkeeper to sell water to consumers bringing their own bottles.We started with a stand-alone water kiosk.

In August 2013, our co-founder and CEO Min, was selected to be part of Villgro’s Entrepreneur-in-residence programme. Their guidance finely tuned our operations to be more dynamic and we applied the structural principles of a lean startup: conducting continuous experiments in the field to gain insight into consumer and the market to perfect the product long before its launch. 
Our early experiments were a window into consumers thoughts on drinking unpackaged water and carrying their own bottles. As we tested our stand-alone kiosk, looking at the role of marketing campaigns, and price in uptake, we realised convenience was of the upmost importance to users. If we wanted people to buy unpackaged water, they would need to have easy access wherever they were.  With the kiosk, capital costs were too high and and logistics too complicated. We needed a cheaper, simpler and more mobile idea that could fit in any common shop so users could refill anywhere.
We pivoted and focused on modular vending machines that would allow us to quickly build a dense network in a city, fully optimising convenience for consumers. Fuelled by the funding provided to us by Villgro and grant money we won through an IIHS competition, we launched full throttle into developing the vending machine. 

THE PROTOTYPE & THE PILOT
Working closely with partners over the last 8 months, we have developed a working prototype that transforms a standard bubble top dispenser into a water ATM. The consumer puts in coins, and the machine  dispenses filtered water. A small display on the front shows the results of testing the  water real-time to ensure that it has been through a functioning RO system.



We’re now working with an experienced manufacturer of vending machines based in Delhi, to improve this prototype, in preparation for a 3 month pilot in Pondicherry to test the market and evaluate performance of the product.
The 3-month pilot consists of: 

Setting up 10 machines in various shops in Pondicherry
Bringing on a partner for sales, distribution and operations
Conducting in-depth research around user behaviour and preferences to inform product design, sales and marketing
Applying logistical research to facilitate the whole administrative system including maintenance and operations 

UPDATE (23rd Feb): 

Here's a quick update from what we've been upto in the last month or so. The prototype has been set up in an ice cream shop on the Pondicherry promenade, where it's been doing good business in the evenings especially. Here's a short video showing a few consumers quenching their thirst. 



NEXT PHASE

This is where you come in and make all the difference in the fight against clean water scarcity and plastic waste. In the next four months as the pilot allows us to prove the viability of the product to long term investors and donors. 
This is what your contribution will allow us to do:

Conduct the pilot rigorously and possibly expand the size
Set up a small office as our headquarters in Auroville
Double our man power by hiring 2 interns and a lead for sales and marketing and bringing our co-founder Akshay, who will drop out of his master’s program, to come on-board full-time 
Bringing on partners for product design and developing the next version of electronics

WHAT ABOUT YOU?


What does the ocean mean to you?What do you know about it?Are you curious about the ocean?So are we! and we believe understanding marine ecosystemsand its enigmatic life is the key to transformthe valorization of our oceans, and the first steptowards its conservation!





The idea of Amazona divers was born from our personal desire to see the change. In our country, Venezuela, the current political system paradoxically does not prioritize education and the quest for knowledge. Our generation was unluckily enough to live how the incentives for education and research diminished year by year in schools and universities, leaving the current generation of students with nothing but a distorted “educational” system, which very last priority is to create critical and educated minds. The social reality of Venezuela is just a consequence of such system. We are responsible for the change! We need to be the change! This is our best reason to create AMAZONA divers, to cultivate fresh knowledge and engage others in the subject we love the most: the ocean!We are a team of two Venezuelan women who actively decided to set aside our current state of life and get underwater! empathy and different EDUCATION is our goal, now we want to  get deeper and make it our profession. We are women of the world, travelers, dreamers, passionate about life.
We want AMAZONA diver for anyone that is curious about the underwater world, anyone that wants to learn about its complex systems and how we relate to them, anyone that has found their passion while being immersed, and anyone that ever thought that diving can be more than a passion,   a life.  


 Our project is sincere, simple and has a long-term vision which involves you!

We want more people to get closer to marine life, understand it from a fresh new perspective, enjoying its complexity, appreciate its value and get inspired to   jump in and discover the amazing underwater world!
How?
While completing our  professional diving training we will combine our  day-to-day underwater experience with our diverse professional skills to   create a digital channel -Open source- where you and many others can   connect and engage our shared passion: the ocean! we will explore sea life through stories, animations, infographics, podcasts, photos, articles, theater, interviews and a bunch of great resources designed and produced by us, and   made ​​available to everyone from        0 to 100 years and surely free!
Where?



We will feature their inspiring stories in our site to spread their efforts towards conservation and encourage others to get deep. We will create a new way of experiencing the underwater world through the ‘digital senses’, taking you with us in this experience as we get wet and deepen our underwater knowledge.


                                                
  




For us, creating AMAZONADIVER.net is only the beginning.
Our long term vision is to use our content to promote marine educational theater workshops in schools and coastal communities all over Central and South America,   to reach places that are still quite unreachable for the digital age and, ironically, are the ones that need to be Reached!




We found our reason for DEEP!Now we have to encourage others   to get involved!



                   
                                                       Diversity is the key!
By mixing our experience and talent we will produce the valuable resources that will engage you and others to dream underwater! Want to know more   about us and what we have done!?




                   We
are grateful for your support!

Your donations will help us manage the costs of our technical diving trainning and, by keeping ourselves submerged and actively discovering the ocean, we can engage full time in innovating and producing new material that will take you and many others in a journey of aquatic knowledge and marine educational theater workshops in schools.

 Nosotras Somos


                                             ¿ Qué significa para ti el Océano?
                                                  ¿Sabes como influyes en él?
                                                  ¿ Y cómo influye él en tí?

Bienvenido a Amazona Diver, nosotras creemos que la comprensión de los ecosistemas marinos y su vida enigmática es la clave para transformar el valor que le damos a los océanos, y el primer paso para su conservación!!
La idea de Amazona
Divers nació de nuestro deseo personal de ver el cambio en nuestro
país Venezuela, donde el sistema político actual, paradójicamente no
prioriza en la Educación y la búsqueda del conocimiento. Por
desgracia año tras año disminuyen los incentivos para la educación
y la investigación en las Escuelas y Universidades, dejando a la
actual generación de estudiantes con nada más que un sistema ""
educativo"" distorsionado, el cual, lo último que consigue es formar mentes críticas y educadas. La realidad social de Venezuela es
sólo una consecuencia de tal sistema. Somos responsables del cambio! 
Tenemos que ser el cambio!
Esta es la razón
por la que creamos Amazona Divers, para cultivar el conocimiento  y comprometer a otros en lo que más amamos: El océano.

Somos un equipo de
dos mujeres venezolanas que decidimos activamente dejar de lado
nuestra vida cotidiana para ser parte del cambio! Empatizar a traves de una  Educación diferente es nuestro objetivo. Somos mujeres del mundo, Viajeras,
Soñadoras y Apasionadas por la vida.

Queremos ser AMAZONA
DIVERS, para alcanzar a muchas personas y despertar en ellos la curiosidad por el mundo submarino, el deseo de  aprender sobre sus complejos sistemas y cómo nos relacionamos
con ellos desde una
perspectiva nueva y fresca, disfrutando de su complejidad, apreciando
su valor y obteneniendo inspiración para saltar y descubrir el
maravilloso mundo submarino!
Nuestro proyecto es sincero, sencillo y tiene una visión a largo plazo, que quiere implicarte !

¿Cómo?


Durante la
realización de nuestro entrenamiento de buceo profesionalcombinaremos nuestra experiencia bajo el agua en el día a día con
nuestras diversas habilidades profesionales para crear un canal
digital, (página web), donde todos  podamos conectarnos, comprometernos y
compartir esta pasión: El Océano! Vamos a explorar la vida
marina a través de historias, animaciones, infografías , podcasts,
fotos, artículos, teatro de las emociones, entrevistas y muchos
otros recursos diseñados y producidos por nosotros, y puestos a
disposición de todas las personas de 0 a 100 años de forma
gratuita!

¿Dónde?

En nuestra Web presentaremos las historias inspiradoras de grandes mujeres y hombres que exploran el océano en la busqueda de un reconocimiento, para difundir sus
esfuerzos en pro de la conservación y animar a otros a mantenerse
sumergidos. Vamos a crear una nueva forma de experimentar el mundo
submarino a través de los sentidos, que te llevará con
nosotros en esta experiencia, y a profundizar en nuestro conocimiento
subacuatico.

                                                
  
Para nosotras crear AMAZONADIVER.net es apenas el principio.


Nuestra visión a
largo plazo es usar nuestro contenido para Promover Talleres de
Educacion Ambiental a traves del Teatro de las Emociones en las
escuelas y comunidades costeras de Centro y Sudamérica, para llegar
a lugares donde la era digital es casi inaccesible.  


¡Nosotras hemos encontrado un camino para generar el Cambio!
¡Ahora queremos animarte a que formes parte de él!






¡En nuestro equipo la Diversidad es La Clave!
Combinando nuestras experiencias y talentos, vamos a producir valiosos recursos que te llevarán a conocer el mundo subacuatico .   ¿Quieres saber más sobre nosotras y lo que haremos? 
¡Estamos más que agradecidas por tu apoyo!
Tu donación nos ayudará a cubrir los gastos de material técnico para el entrenamiento y realización de la página web y nos permitirá mantenernos sumergidas descubriendo activamente el océano, para dedicarle todo nuestro tiempo en crear, innovar y producir nuevo material con el cual los envolveremos a todos en una jornada de conocimiento subacuático, así como la elaboración de talleres de educación ambiental a través del teatro de las emociones en escuelas de  las costas de  América Central y Sur américa.

<p>In December of 1982, an American graduate student fleeing a
South American civil war paid a bush pilot to drop him on the most remote
airstrip in the rainforests of the northeast Amazon. There, Mark Plotkin was
met by the Trio Indians, none of whom he knew and whose language he did not
speak.</p>
<p>More than three decades later,
Dr. Mark Plotkin is considered one of the most innovative and effective conservationists
in the world today. And his partnership with the Trio people has endured and
flourished, in conjunction with Mark’s organization, the Amazon Conservation
Team (ACT).</p>

<p>Together, Mark, ACT and the Trio
tribe pioneered an approach to rainforest mapping that spread to 30 other
tribes and resulted in the improved management and protection of more than 70 million
acres of ancestral rainforest. (See more about this in an interview with <a href=""http://harvardmagazine.com/2013/02/mapping-the-amazon"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Harvard Magazine</a>)</p>
<p>Today, Mark and ACT focus much of
their efforts on protecting the last of the uncontacted tribes and their
rainforest. (You can learn more about this in Mark’s superb <a href=""https://www.ted.com/talks/mark_plotkin_what_the_people_of_the_amazon_know_that_you_don_t?language=en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TED

<p><b>Background</b></p>
<p>Of all these accolades and
achievements, Mark is best known for partnering with the Trios to create the Shamans
and Apprentices Program in which elder shamans pass their botanical healing
wisdom to the next generation of healers within the tribe (Watch the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS7jU15UY1w"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Shamans and Apprentices
Program in action</a>). ACT provides sponsorships or stipends to support this
training so that shamans and apprentices can focus fully on the work. Not only
has this resulted in the first book in Trio other than the Bible, but the forest
communities and the Amazon Conservation Team have together created four Shamans
and Apprentices clinics where traditional medicine is both practiced and

important goal: fully documenting the entire spectrum of Trio knowledge of
animals and plants into a “Trio Shamanic Encyclopedia and Atlas.” This will
entail working closely with elder shamans and tribal youth, equipping them with
the training and resources necessary to document this information in their own
language and on their own terms. <b>The

</div></div>","It's Dr. Mark Plotkin's 60th Birthday! Help us raise $60,000 to create the first Trio Indian Shaman’s Encyclopedia. This document* will become a template for tribal peoples throughout the Amazon, providing a tangible way to save oral shamanic wisdom in all of lowland South America.
(*The Encyclopedia will be in the Trio language and only available to the Trio people who can then share the document and their methodologies with fellow tribes. This information will not be made public or translated into any other language, thereby keeping all of the Trio's information safe & private.)
Mark Plotkin’s Amazon Conservation Team
partners with indigenous people to protect the rainforest. ACT Advisory Board
member Jeff “The Dude” Bridges shares how he learned about the Amazon
Conservation Team, as well as the initiatives that continue to make ACT a
leader in the conservation movement.


In December of 1982, an American graduate student fleeing a
South American civil war paid a bush pilot to drop him on the most remote
airstrip in the rainforests of the northeast Amazon. There, Mark Plotkin was
met by the Trio Indians, none of whom he knew and whose language he did not
speak.
More than three decades later,
Dr. Mark Plotkin is considered one of the most innovative and effective conservationists
in the world today. And his partnership with the Trio people has endured and
flourished, in conjunction with Mark’s organization, the Amazon Conservation
Team (ACT).



On the left, Mark (then a graduate student) stands with Kamainja (then a shaman's apprentice) in 1984. On the right, Dr. Mark Plotkin and Kamainja (now a shaman) in 2014.
Together, Mark, ACT and the Trio
tribe pioneered an approach to rainforest mapping that spread to 30 other
tribes and resulted in the improved management and protection of more than 70 million
acres of ancestral rainforest. (See more about this in an interview with Harvard Magazine)
Today, Mark and ACT focus much of
their efforts on protecting the last of the uncontacted tribes and their
rainforest. (You can learn more about this in Mark’s superb TED
Talk)

Background
Of all these accolades and
achievements, Mark is best known for partnering with the Trios to create the Shamans
and Apprentices Program in which elder shamans pass their botanical healing
wisdom to the next generation of healers within the tribe (Watch the Shamans and Apprentices
Program in action). ACT provides sponsorships or stipends to support this
training so that shamans and apprentices can focus fully on the work. Not only
has this resulted in the first book in Trio other than the Bible, but the forest
communities and the Amazon Conservation Team have together created four Shamans
and Apprentices clinics where traditional medicine is both practiced and
taught.

<ul>
<li>Globally, scientists are raising concern about cell phone tower adverse impacts on animals and their habitats.</li>
<li>Locally, Verizon plans to locate a cell phone tower in rich habitat used by big 
horn sheep, bear, deer and other wildlife and refuses to consider less 
environmentally-sensitive alternative locations.<br/>
</li>
<li>Verizon dismisses Tribal Chairman's request to relocate the tower and protect sacred habitat of ""Pah-aht"", big horn sheep.
<br/>
</li>
<li>
Verizon fails to recognize concerned citizens as stakeholders in the cell phone tower project.
</li>
<li>
To date, the county government sides with Verizon. Now concerned citizens are left to stand up to corporate-government alliances.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
What is THE SOLUTION?  How will funds be used?
</h3>The solution is to change the cell phone tower site!  Less environmentally-sensitive alternative locations for this tower exist. Through unrelenting courage we need to stand up to corporate power and make sure Verizon will consider these alternative sites. As a contributor, you will be helping to set a precedent for global environmentally-conscious cell phone tower placements that pose a <i>minimal </i>threat to animals and their habitats.  You also will be raising public awareness regarding the need for safer cell phone tower technology.  Our success can empower others to take action in their communities.
<br/><br/>For three years we have used personal funds to champion our cause. Only now are we turning to the wider community for financial support.
Your donations will be used to pay for credentialed professional  environmental reports that will be submitted during a public hearing before county supervisors. These written reports are expensive since they are detailed analyses that can stand up to the studies submitted by Verizon. Scientific experts can ensure that proper, <i>unbiased</i> studies will be put forth at the hearing.  <br/>
<br/>
<h3>
Where is the habitat and why is it unique?
</h3>

<p>The habitat is in Mt. Baldy, California, a mountainous area in the Angeles National Forest, and it is unique because it is the only habitat on the mountain that is near three water sources--a natural pond, spring and San Antonio Creek, a primary water source for local big horn sheep. The area is a magnet for wildlife. The denser vegetation around the pond and creek provide wildlife a rich environment for foraging, nesting and camouflaging. The habitat is a complex ecosystem, home to many insects, reptiles, amphibians and abundant wildlife, including numerous bird species, black bear, mule deer, gray foxes, mountain lions, bobcats, coyotes, raccoons and chipmunks, to name a few. USDA-Forest Service and California Fish and Wildlife threatened, sensitive and special concern species reside in the region as well as a Federal and State Endangered species.</p>

What have we been doing to stop construction of the cell phone tower in its environmentally-sensitive location?

<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444521645/v7b4gzjhks3av2ghhoah.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
We embarked on this journey three years ago, insisting on a biology (California Environmental Quality Act-CEQA) and cultural (Cultural Resource Assessment) study of the site. Using consultants known to have a corporate bias, Verizon's reports were grossly inadequate. Not only did the biology report fail to identify endangered or protected species in the area, the biology field study conducted for the report was done in the winter instead of the spring! This meant that birds that nest or migrate to this habitat in the spring were not identified, nor were reptiles and amphibians due to their winter hibernation.
<br/><br/>
The cultural report failed to identify the Indian tribe, Gabrieleno Band of Mission Indians Kizh Nation, that has an ancestral connection to the area. More importantly, this proper Indian tribe was never contacted prior to the January public hearing to provide comment on the project site! Also, because of a deficient archeological site survey, the presence of significant cultural resources on the property is still undetermined.
<br/>
<br/>
In two public hearings before county planning commissioners, we expressed our concerns about the environmental and cultural sensitivity of Verizon's chosen site and the inadequacy of the biology and cultural reports, but despite our efforts, the commissioners voted to approve the tower location. We have appealed their decision and will now present our concerns before county supervisors.  Due to our appeal, construction of the cell tower facility is on hold.
<br/><br/>
<h3>
What are we doing now to stop construction of the cell phone tower in its environmentally-sensitive location?
</h3>
We are preparing for our upcoming public hearing before county supervisors by securing professional experts, namely in the fields of biology and archeology, to provide written reports regarding the environmental and cultural sensitivity of Verizon's chosen site.
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Who are we?</h3>
We are concerned citizens. Our grassroots organization,
<a href=""http://www.keepbaldywild.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Keep Baldy Wild</a> 
is a group of residents, hikers and visitors to Mt. Baldy in coalition with businesses, labor, faith-based and community organizations interested in preserving the natural environment of Mt. Baldy.
<br/>
<br/>
We are also advocates for citizen participation in government-corporate decisions that affect local communities. We should have input on development in our neighborhoods!  Verizon's unwillingness to consider alternative locations for this tower is unacceptable, especially when thousands of acres are available.  How many times has development occurred in your community without you knowing about it or having a say in the project? Keep Baldy Wild is making progress as a model for other local groups challenging government-corporate decisions. We care about concerned citizens who know what is best for their communities.
<br/>
<br/>
We are advocates for safer, environmentally-conscious cell tower installations that have a minimal negative impact on the environment and for safer, biologically-based standards for cell tower radiation (see next section for more information).

What do I need to know about cell towers?
</h3>
(references listed in Information section below)
<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444772323/y6cgl5uxmsnnzyjdpoeu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Cell towers transmit and receive non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation called radio frequency radiation (RFR). In the journal article, ""Electromagnetic Pollution from phone masts. Effects on Wildlife"", biologist Alfonso Balmori cites various scientific studies supporting the fact that RFR can adversely impact the nervous, cardiovascular, immune and reproductive systems of animals.<sup>1</sup>
<br/>
<br/>
In Germany, once microwave antennae were installed on a former television/radio tower, cows next to the tower suffered reduced milk yields, emaciation, spontaneous abortions and stillbirths. When the cows were removed to pastures away from the mast, their conditions improved, but deteriorated again when they were brought back to the tower site.<sup>3</sup>
<br/>
<br/>In a <a href=""http://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/us_doi_comments.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">February 2014 letter</a> to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, the director of the Office of Environmental Policy and Compliance of the United States Department of Interior emphasizes concern about the negative impact of cell tower radiation on the health of migratory birds and other wildlife and recommends placing cell towers in more environmentally benign locations<br/>
<br/>
<h3>
Why should I care about this issue?
</h3>

About 5 million cell towers populate the world. In 1985, there were 900 towers in the United States. Today, that figure has risen to 205,000 towers that expand across both urban and rural landscapes. In spite of the vast expansion of cell towers in the past twenty years, inadequate attention has been given to their impact on the environment, particularly with respect to the biological effect of cell tower radio frequency radiation (RFR) on wildlife, insects and plants. Until a biologically safe RFR standard for cell towers is established, it is important for communities to uphold the principle of ""prudent avoidance"" by insisting that towers are placed at a distance from humans, wildlife and environmentally rich areas. <br/>

</table></div>","What is THE PROBLEM?

Globally, scientists are raising concern about cell phone tower adverse impacts on animals and their habitats.
Locally, Verizon plans to locate a cell phone tower in rich habitat used by big 
horn sheep, bear, deer and other wildlife and refuses to consider less 
environmentally-sensitive alternative locations.

Verizon dismisses Tribal Chairman's request to relocate the tower and protect sacred habitat of ""Pah-aht"", big horn sheep.



Verizon fails to recognize concerned citizens as stakeholders in the cell phone tower project.


To date, the county government sides with Verizon. Now concerned citizens are left to stand up to corporate-government alliances.



What is THE SOLUTION?  How will funds be used?
The solution is to change the cell phone tower site!  Less environmentally-sensitive alternative locations for this tower exist. Through unrelenting courage we need to stand up to corporate power and make sure Verizon will consider these alternative sites. As a contributor, you will be helping to set a precedent for global environmentally-conscious cell phone tower placements that pose a minimal threat to animals and their habitats.  You also will be raising public awareness regarding the need for safer cell phone tower technology.  Our success can empower others to take action in their communities.
For three years we have used personal funds to champion our cause. Only now are we turning to the wider community for financial support.
Your donations will be used to pay for credentialed professional  environmental reports that will be submitted during a public hearing before county supervisors. These written reports are expensive since they are detailed analyses that can stand up to the studies submitted by Verizon. Scientific experts can ensure that proper, unbiased studies will be put forth at the hearing.  


Where is the habitat and why is it unique?






The habitat is in Mt. Baldy, California, a mountainous area in the Angeles National Forest, and it is unique because it is the only habitat on the mountain that is near three water sources--a natural pond, spring and San Antonio Creek, a primary water source for local big horn sheep. The area is a magnet for wildlife. The denser vegetation around the pond and creek provide wildlife a rich environment for foraging, nesting and camouflaging. The habitat is a complex ecosystem, home to many insects, reptiles, amphibians and abundant wildlife, including numerous bird species, black bear, mule deer, gray foxes, mountain lions, bobcats, coyotes, raccoons and chipmunks, to name a few. USDA-Forest Service and California Fish and Wildlife threatened, sensitive and special concern species reside in the region as well as a Federal and State Endangered species.

What have we been doing to stop construction of the cell phone tower in its environmentally-sensitive location?



We embarked on this journey three years ago, insisting on a biology (California Environmental Quality Act-CEQA) and cultural (Cultural Resource Assessment) study of the site. Using consultants known to have a corporate bias, Verizon's reports were grossly inadequate. Not only did the biology report fail to identify endangered or protected species in the area, the biology field study conducted for the report was done in the winter instead of the spring! This meant that birds that nest or migrate to this habitat in the spring were not identified, nor were reptiles and amphibians due to their winter hibernation.

The cultural report failed to identify the Indian tribe, Gabrieleno Band of Mission Indians Kizh Nation, that has an ancestral connection to the area. More importantly, this proper Indian tribe was never contacted prior to the January public hearing to provide comment on the project site! Also, because of a deficient archeological site survey, the presence of significant cultural resources on the property is still undetermined.


In two public hearings before county planning commissioners, we expressed our concerns about the environmental and cultural sensitivity of Verizon's chosen site and the inadequacy of the biology and cultural reports, but despite our efforts, the commissioners voted to approve the tower location. We have appealed their decision and will now present our concerns before county supervisors.  Due to our appeal, construction of the cell tower facility is on hold.


What are we doing now to stop construction of the cell phone tower in its environmentally-sensitive location?

We are preparing for our upcoming public hearing before county supervisors by securing professional experts, namely in the fields of biology and archeology, to provide written reports regarding the environmental and cultural sensitivity of Verizon's chosen site.


Who are we?
We are concerned citizens. Our grassroots organization,
Keep Baldy Wild 
is a group of residents, hikers and visitors to Mt. Baldy in coalition with businesses, labor, faith-based and community organizations interested in preserving the natural environment of Mt. Baldy.


We are also advocates for citizen participation in government-corporate decisions that affect local communities. We should have input on development in our neighborhoods!  Verizon's unwillingness to consider alternative locations for this tower is unacceptable, especially when thousands of acres are available.  How many times has development occurred in your community without you knowing about it or having a say in the project? Keep Baldy Wild is making progress as a model for other local groups challenging government-corporate decisions. We care about concerned citizens who know what is best for their communities.


We are advocates for safer, environmentally-conscious cell tower installations that have a minimal negative impact on the environment and for safer, biologically-based standards for cell tower radiation (see next section for more information).



What do I need to know about cell towers?

(references listed in Information section below)
Cell towers transmit and receive non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation called radio frequency radiation (RFR). In the journal article, ""Electromagnetic Pollution from phone masts. Effects on Wildlife"", biologist Alfonso Balmori cites various scientific studies supporting the fact that RFR can adversely impact the nervous, cardiovascular, immune and reproductive systems of animals.1


In Germany, once microwave antennae were installed on a former television/radio tower, cows next to the tower suffered reduced milk yields, emaciation, spontaneous abortions and stillbirths. When the cows were removed to pastures away from the mast, their conditions improved, but deteriorated again when they were brought back to the tower site.3

In a February 2014 letter to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, the director of the Office of Environmental Policy and Compliance of the United States Department of Interior emphasizes concern about the negative impact of cell tower radiation on the health of migratory birds and other wildlife and recommends placing cell towers in more environmentally benign locations


Why should I care about this issue?


About 5 million cell towers populate the world. In 1985, there were 900 towers in the United States. Today, that figure has risen to 205,000 towers that expand across both urban and rural landscapes. In spite of the vast expansion of cell towers in the past twenty years, inadequate attention has been given to their impact on the environment, particularly with respect to the biological effect of cell tower radio frequency radiation (RFR) on wildlife, insects and plants. Until a biologically safe RFR standard for cell towers is established, it is important for communities to uphold the principle of ""prudent avoidance"" by insisting that towers are placed at a distance from humans, wildlife and environmentally rich areas.

What are our risks/challenges?
Standing up to the telecom giant, Verizon, is not easy.  Many hours of research and outreach have been spent on this cutting-edge effort.  No matter how steep the climb, through your support, we will push forward.  Together, by setting a precedent for the safer placement of cell phone towers and for safer cell phone tower technology, we can protect the health of the planet. Help us turn the page on this critical environmental issue.

<p><i>A watershed is not a
shed that stores water, but an area of land that “catches” water, or a
“catchment.” It is defined by topography—the shape of the land—rather than by
political boundaries or property lines. Water flows from higher parts of the
landscape, such as ridges, towards lower areas, such as valleys or ravines.
Runoff often forms a river or creek that makes its way toward a lake, bay or
ocean.</i></p>
<p><i>A watershed is a place
where all beings are connected through the life-giving flow of water. As water
moves over and through the landscape, it carries soil and rock to form new
habitats, brings sustenance to plants, and gives nourishment to wildlife and
human communities. <br/></i></p>
<p><i>Just as creeks can be
part of larger river systems, smaller watersheds are part of larger watersheds.
So, too, are humans, wildlife, and elements of earth held within this branching
web of life.</i><br/></p></div>","Short Summary

    The Impact The Marin County Civic Center is a state and national Historic Site and a
 UNESCO-nominated World Heritage Site. As conceived by Frank Lloyd 
Wright, the Civic Center Lagoon and its surrounding parklands are an 
area for recreation, notable in that they interconnect manicured 
landscapes with the natural world. The lagoon connects directly to the South Fork of Gallinas Creek and the
 San Pablo Bay marshlands, habitat for endangered species such as the 
Salt Marsh Harvest Mouse and California Ridgeway’s Rail (formerly California Clapper Rail).

The Marin Civic Center, which includes the county administrative 
offices, county fair grounds, and a performing arts and convention 
center, is going through a substantial transformation. A SMART train station, Civic Center Drive Improvements Project and proposed 
Farmers Market complex are all clustered near the site of the lagoon and the South Fork of Gallinas Creek.
Floating island biofilters have 
been successfully used around the world. Closer to home there have been launched by similar community funded-coalitions in Walnut Creek and 
Marysville, CA. 
Learn about a similar floating island biofilter project at Heather Farm in Walnut Creek:
  Challenges  While floating island have been successful around the world, they are new to Marin County. Our project at the Civic Center is attracting lots of attention. We hope it will result in more floating island projects as well as additional measures to help the Gallinas Watershed.   
We only have a few days to raise funds and pay for our floating island.

We have a great team of volunteers that includes the Santa Venetia Neighborhood Association and the Marin School of Environmental Leadership.    Ways You Can Help Your help now will demonstrate that a model of local business, foundations, and community groups can join with government to foster community stewardship of a Marin County watershed. 
Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  Get the word out and make some noise about our project. Use the Indiegogo share tools!

*What is a Watershed?
A watershed is not a
shed that stores water, but an area of land that “catches” water, or a
“catchment.” It is defined by topography—the shape of the land—rather than by
political boundaries or property lines. Water flows from higher parts of the
landscape, such as ridges, towards lower areas, such as valleys or ravines.
Runoff often forms a river or creek that makes its way toward a lake, bay or
ocean.
A watershed is a place
where all beings are connected through the life-giving flow of water. As water
moves over and through the landscape, it carries soil and rock to form new
habitats, brings sustenance to plants, and gives nourishment to wildlife and
human communities. 
Just as creeks can be
part of larger river systems, smaller watersheds are part of larger watersheds.
So, too, are humans, wildlife, and elements of earth held within this branching
web of life.",3.0,3,"1 Campaign

<p><b><b>GARBAGE UNIVERSITY </b></b></p>
<p>The first Garbage University,
generating environmental and social awareness.</p>
<p>Due to the pollution humans are
generating by leaps and bounds, a transformation is needed in people’s
understanding to redefine the concept of waste. Over eighty percent of the
materials that go to landfills, rivers and seas from the various cities in
Colombia can be reused.</p>
<p>The transformation of knowledge to
redefine garbage must be a new life culture, where the challenge will be to get
people to find innovative ideas built from waste products. Using new art and
design creations will be a key factor in this.</p>
<p>The Garbage University was born from
this idea: a space created for environmental education generating products
useful to society.</p>
<p>The main thrust is to create an
educational model to generate knowledge among people, while they care for the
environment.</p>
<b>INNOVATIVE DESIGNS<br/><br/></b>
<p>The aim is that through knowledge of
discarded materials and intensive design training people will generate new
product ideas, develop them and reintegrate these materials into society.</p>
<p>What can be achieved with waste? The
first thing to be done is a selection by quality, i.e., an initial separation
at the source. After classification, the properties, shapes, patterns, and
compositions of materials have to be looked at to begin designing and creating,
searching for a homogenization of forms that creates structures and new elements.
The lamps created from PET (polyethylene terephthalate), a type of plastic widely
used in beverage cans and textiles, are a tangible example.</p>

<p><b>ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL BENEFITS</b></p>
<p>Quantifying the benefits for the
planet and future generations of increasing environmental awareness is perhaps
a mathematical formula that would lead to infinite expressions, and its outcome
as paradoxical as wanting to quantify the satisfaction we feel when we help or
save someone. But we do want to list a few of its many benefits:</p>
<p>1.  Preserving nature</p>
<p>2.  Salubrity in our environment</p>
<p>3.  Health</p>
<p>4.  Resource savings</p>
<p>5.  Social inclusion</p>
<p>6.  Economic benefits</p>
<p>7.  Development of new, socially useful
products.</p>
<p>8.  Generation of environmental knowledge</p>
<p><b>ENVIRONMENTAL FACTS</b></p>
<p>Every human being produces 8.5 tons
of garbage in his or her life, actually throwing away more packaging than the products
we actually consume.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Biodegradation <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodegradation"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodegradation</a></p>
<p><b>REFRAMING, REUSING AND RECYCLING</b></p>
<p>These are the three basic rules that
govern the model of knowledge transfer at Garbage University:</p>
<p><b>REFRAMING</b></p>
<p>The process by which materials thrown
out as waste by people are collected and once again given a useful purpose in
society.</p>
<p><b>REUSING</b></p>
<p>Reusing is the action of used goods
or products again, and of giving them another use.</p>
<p><a href=""http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reutilizaci%C3%B3n"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reutilización</a></p>
<p><b>RECYCLING</b></p>
<p>Recycling is a process aimed at
turning waste into new products to prevent discharge of potentially useful
materials, reduce the consumption of new raw materials, and reduce energy
usage, reduce air pollution (by incineration) and water pollution (through landfills),
by reducing the need for conventional waste systems and by reducing emissions
of greenhouse gases, compared to the production of plastics. Recycling is a key
component in reducing contemporary waste and is the third component of the 3Rs (""Reduce,
Reuse, Recycle"").</p>
<p><a href=""http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciclaje"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciclaje</a></p>
<p><b>CLOSING THE CYCLE</b></p>
<p>This model seeks to complete the
production cycle and thus not generate waste but raw materials, which will be
reused in new products and create a reduction in the consumption of natural
resources, while avoiding accumulation of these materials in rivers, seas and
forests. Products will be fully recovered by the end of their useful life.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>COEXISTENCE REQUIREMENT</b></p>
<p>The idea is to generate awareness
among people so that garbage becomes a desired element, through knowledge of
materials that will respect their end disposal.</p>
<p><b>INDIEGOGO CAMPAIGN </b></p>
<p>Garbage University is a Colombian
idea, developed by the Error314 brand and the GSU recycling company, who joined
in a common purpose to create an environmental and social model that generates
a positive impact on our society.</p>
<p>We are a team of people committed to
the environment and social awareness: Julio Cesar Rodriguez, the project
creator, is an industrial designer focused on the production of art using waste
materials with his Error314 brand (<a href=""http://www.error314.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.error314.com</a>); Juan Manuel Erazo is a
Business Administrator with interests in sustainable alternatives, who worked
with the Australian Environment Protection Authority - EPA; Juan Carlos
Rodriguez is an industrial engineer with experience in the food and consumer industry
who has worked the last 10 years in the financial sector, giving him statistical
approach and clear and sustainable work objectives; and Alexander Beltran is a recycler
by trade and an expert in the management of waste materials.</p>
<b>GOALS</b>
<p>At present there are a number of
prototype products that are marketed. Assembling the production line requires
training more staff, developing new products, and having a workspace. With this
we will be ready to begin production at Garbage University. Our goals for the Garbage
University campaign are:</p>
<p><b>USD $ 1,000,000</b></p>
<p>Coverage of costs for establishing
the entire production line and the manufacture of the first series of products,
destined to pioneer IndieGoGo contributors.</p>
<p><b>$ 1,300,000</b></p>
<p>Creation of new products and
improvements in production.</p>
<p><b>$ 1,900,000</b></p>
<p>Establishing the Garbage University
with a Research and Development Center that focuses on educating people,
especially in the use of waste materials to generate new products.</p>
<p><b>CHOOSE YOUR PRODUCT</b></p>
<p>When choosing a product we must not think
we are buying only the good we will receive, the true gift is the satisfaction
of helping the cause by the nature and value each product received must have.
This is your donation to improving the environment.</p>
<p><b>ORDERING</b></p>
<p>When you give your contribution,
make a copy of the transaction confirmation and send it to us at <a href=""mailto:gsusas@outlook.es"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">gsusas@outlook.es</a>, with the shipping information.</p>
<p><b>SHIPPING COSTS</b></p>
<p>We do not cover delivery costs for
products purchased by persons involved in the IndieGoGo campaign; these will be
charged to the product at the time of shipment.</p>
<p><b>THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING</b></p>
<p>Garbage University is the result of a
dream for a better world for future generations. We are proud of what we have
created, and we firmly believe it is a huge step in the right direction to
benefit the environment and the most vulnerable population groups. Its unique
point of view is an initiative that brings together the fight against pollution
and against unemployment.</p>
<p>Over the coming months we will be
working on finishing the last details, organization of production, shipments,
and management of random contingencies. In all this, your contribution will
make a difference.</p>
<p>If we can help you become aware of
what is happening today and you want to be part of the solution, consider
becoming a player in the success of this campaign! Support us with a donation,
and share our model of environmental education with everyone, or just talk with
friends and family, share our campaign and let the world know about us!</p>
<b><span>UNIVERSIDAD DE LA BASURA</span></b>
<p>La primera Universidad de la Basura, generando conciencia
ambiental y social.</p>
<p>Debido a la contaminación que los seres humanos estamos
realizando a pasos agigantados, se ve necesario una transformación al
conocimiento de las personas para resignificar el concepto de basura. Puesto
que en un porcentaje de más del ochenta por ciento del material que va a parar
a los botaderos, ríos y mares, de las diferentes ciudades de Colombia se puede
reutilizar.</p>
<p>La transformación del conocimiento para resignificar la basura,
debe ser una nueva cultura de vida, donde se debe buscar como reto que las
personas tengan como objetivo indagar en ideas innovadoras de productos
construidos a través de los residuos. Para ello es importante utilizar nuevas
creaciones a partir del arte y el diseño. </p>
<p>De esta idea nace la Universidad de la Basura, un espacio
creado para la educación ambiental generando productos útiles a la sociedad. </p>
<p>La idea principal es crear un modelo de educación para
generar conocimiento en las personas, mientras cuidan el medio ambiente. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b><span>DISEÑOS INNOVADORES </span></b></p>
<p>Se busca que a través del conocimiento de los materiales
desechados y una capacitación intensiva en diseño que las personas generen
ideas de productos nuevos, para desarrollarlos y reintegrarlos a la sociedad. </p>
<p>¿Qué se puede hacer con los residuos? Lo primero que se debe
hacer es una selección de la calidad, es decir, una separación inicial en la
fuente. Luego de la clasificación se debe mirar las propiedades de los
materiales, formas, esquemas, estructuras que tiene el mismo para empezar a
diseñar y crear, buscando una homogenización de las formas para crear
estructuras e ir fabricando nuevos elementos. Un ejemplo tangible son las
lámparas creadas a partir de PET (más conocido por sus siglas en inglés
PET, polyethylene terephtalate,  que
es un tipo de plástico, muy usado en envases de bebidas y textiles).</p>
<p><b><span>MATERIALES USADOS PARA CREAR NUEVOS PRODUCTOS</span></b></p>
<p>Hemos resignificado diversos materiales de desecho
convirtiéndolos en los siguientes productos:</p>

<p><b><span>BENEFICIO AMBIENTAL Y SOCIAL</span></b></p>
<p>Cuantificar los beneficios que tiene para el planeta y las
futuras generaciones, el lograr tener conciencia ecológica, tal vez sea una
formula matemática que nos lleve a expresiones infinitas y resultaría tan
paradójico su resultado como querer cuantificar la  satisfacción que sentimos cuando ayudamos o

<p><b><span>RESIGNIFICAR, REUSAR Y RECICLAR</span></b></p>
<p>Estas son las tres reglas básicas que regirán el modelo de transmisión
de conocimiento por la Universidad de la Basura:</p>
<p><b><span>RESIGNIFICAR </span></b></p>
<p>Proceso por el cual se toma los materiales desechados por las
personas y se les vuelve a dar un significado útil para la sociedad. </p>
<p><b><span>REUSAR  </span></b></p>
<p>Reutilizar es la acción de volver a utilizar los bienes o
productos, y darles otro uso. </p>
<p><a href=""http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reutilizaci%C3%B3n"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reutilizaci%C3%B3n</span></a></p>
<p><b><span>RECICLAR</span></b></p>
<p>El reciclaje es un proceso cuyo objetivo es convertir
desechos en nuevos productos para prevenir el desuso de materiales
potencialmente útiles, reducir el consumo de nueva materia prima, reducir el
uso de energía, reducir la contaminación del aire (a través de la incineración)
y del agua (a través de los vertederos) por medio de la reducción de la
necesidad de los sistemas de desechos convencionales, así como también
disminuir las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero en comparación con la
producción de plásticos. El reciclaje es un componente clave en la reducción de
desechos contemporáneos y es el tercer componente de las 3R (“Reducir, Reutilizar,
Reciclar”).</p>
<p><a href=""http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciclaje"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciclaje</span></a></p>
<p><b><span>CERRANDO EL CICLO</span></b></p>
<p>Por medio de este modelo se busca completar el clico de
producción y como resultado que no se produzcan desechos, sino materia prima,
que será reutilizada en nuevos productos, generando una reducción en el consumo
de recursos naturales y evitando acumulación de estos materiales en los ríos,
mares y bosques. Para que los productos se recuperen por completo al final de
su vida útil. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b><span>REQUISITO DE CONVIVENCIA</span></b></p>
<p>La idea es generar conciencia en las personas para generar
que la basura se convierta en un material deseado, a través del conocimiento de
los materiales para respetar su disposición final.  </p>

The first Garbage University,
generating environmental and social awareness.
Due to the pollution humans are
generating by leaps and bounds, a transformation is needed in people’s
understanding to redefine the concept of waste. Over eighty percent of the
materials that go to landfills, rivers and seas from the various cities in
Colombia can be reused.
The transformation of knowledge to
redefine garbage must be a new life culture, where the challenge will be to get
people to find innovative ideas built from waste products. Using new art and
design creations will be a key factor in this.
The Garbage University was born from
this idea: a space created for environmental education generating products
useful to society.
The main thrust is to create an
educational model to generate knowledge among people, while they care for the
environment.
INNOVATIVE DESIGNS
The aim is that through knowledge of
discarded materials and intensive design training people will generate new
product ideas, develop them and reintegrate these materials into society.
What can be achieved with waste? The
first thing to be done is a selection by quality, i.e., an initial separation
at the source. After classification, the properties, shapes, patterns, and
compositions of materials have to be looked at to begin designing and creating,
searching for a homogenization of forms that creates structures and new elements.
The lamps created from PET (polyethylene terephthalate), a type of plastic widely
used in beverage cans and textiles, are a tangible example.



MATERIALS USED TO CREATE NEW PRODUCTS
We have redefined various waste
materials by converting them into these products:






Vertical Garden created with PET
Bottles




Structure with parts of amber PET
Bottles





Ceiling lamp made from glass PET
bottles 




Chandelier from glass PET bottles.




The City of Cali flag where 22,000
PET bottles were used.


Landscaping held in Acunares kindergartens,
sensitizing children through work with soil and recycling. Project carried out
with the District Secretary for Social Integration (SDIS)




The Colombian flag, made with 40,000
PET bottles recovered from the Cauca River. Developed for the Andino Shopping Mall
in the city of Bogotá.
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL BENEFITS
Quantifying the benefits for the
planet and future generations of increasing environmental awareness is perhaps
a mathematical formula that would lead to infinite expressions, and its outcome
as paradoxical as wanting to quantify the satisfaction we feel when we help or
save someone. But we do want to list a few of its many benefits:
1.  Preserving nature
2.  Salubrity in our environment
3.  Health
4.  Resource savings
5.  Social inclusion
6.  Economic benefits
7.  Development of new, socially useful
products.
8.  Generation of environmental knowledge
ENVIRONMENTAL FACTS
Every human being produces 8.5 tons
of garbage in his or her life, actually throwing away more packaging than the products
we actually consume.


Biodegradation http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodegradation
REFRAMING, REUSING AND RECYCLING
These are the three basic rules that
govern the model of knowledge transfer at Garbage University:
REFRAMING
The process by which materials thrown
out as waste by people are collected and once again given a useful purpose in
society.
REUSING
Reusing is the action of used goods
or products again, and of giving them another use.
http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reutilización
RECYCLING
Recycling is a process aimed at
turning waste into new products to prevent discharge of potentially useful
materials, reduce the consumption of new raw materials, and reduce energy
usage, reduce air pollution (by incineration) and water pollution (through landfills),
by reducing the need for conventional waste systems and by reducing emissions
of greenhouse gases, compared to the production of plastics. Recycling is a key
component in reducing contemporary waste and is the third component of the 3Rs (""Reduce,
Reuse, Recycle"").
http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciclaje
CLOSING THE CYCLE
This model seeks to complete the
production cycle and thus not generate waste but raw materials, which will be
reused in new products and create a reduction in the consumption of natural
resources, while avoiding accumulation of these materials in rivers, seas and
forests. Products will be fully recovered by the end of their useful life.


COEXISTENCE REQUIREMENT
The idea is to generate awareness
among people so that garbage becomes a desired element, through knowledge of
materials that will respect their end disposal.
INDIEGOGO CAMPAIGN 
Garbage University is a Colombian
idea, developed by the Error314 brand and the GSU recycling company, who joined
in a common purpose to create an environmental and social model that generates
a positive impact on our society.
We are a team of people committed to
the environment and social awareness: Julio Cesar Rodriguez, the project
creator, is an industrial designer focused on the production of art using waste
materials with his Error314 brand (www.error314.com); Juan Manuel Erazo is a
Business Administrator with interests in sustainable alternatives, who worked
with the Australian Environment Protection Authority - EPA; Juan Carlos
Rodriguez is an industrial engineer with experience in the food and consumer industry
who has worked the last 10 years in the financial sector, giving him statistical
approach and clear and sustainable work objectives; and Alexander Beltran is a recycler
by trade and an expert in the management of waste materials.
GOALS
At present there are a number of
prototype products that are marketed. Assembling the production line requires
training more staff, developing new products, and having a workspace. With this
we will be ready to begin production at Garbage University. Our goals for the Garbage
University campaign are:
USD $ 1,000,000
Coverage of costs for establishing
the entire production line and the manufacture of the first series of products,
destined to pioneer IndieGoGo contributors.
$ 1,300,000
Creation of new products and
improvements in production.
$ 1,900,000
Establishing the Garbage University
with a Research and Development Center that focuses on educating people,
especially in the use of waste materials to generate new products.
CHOOSE YOUR PRODUCT
When choosing a product we must not think
we are buying only the good we will receive, the true gift is the satisfaction
of helping the cause by the nature and value each product received must have.
This is your donation to improving the environment.
ORDERING
When you give your contribution,
make a copy of the transaction confirmation and send it to us at gsusas@outlook.es, with the shipping information.
SHIPPING COSTS
We do not cover delivery costs for
products purchased by persons involved in the IndieGoGo campaign; these will be
charged to the product at the time of shipment.
THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING
Garbage University is the result of a
dream for a better world for future generations. We are proud of what we have
created, and we firmly believe it is a huge step in the right direction to
benefit the environment and the most vulnerable population groups. Its unique
point of view is an initiative that brings together the fight against pollution
and against unemployment.
Over the coming months we will be
working on finishing the last details, organization of production, shipments,
and management of random contingencies. In all this, your contribution will
make a difference.
If we can help you become aware of
what is happening today and you want to be part of the solution, consider
becoming a player in the success of this campaign! Support us with a donation,
and share our model of environmental education with everyone, or just talk with
friends and family, share our campaign and let the world know about us!
UNIVERSIDAD DE LA BASURA
La primera Universidad de la Basura, generando conciencia
ambiental y social.
Debido a la contaminación que los seres humanos estamos
realizando a pasos agigantados, se ve necesario una transformación al
conocimiento de las personas para resignificar el concepto de basura. Puesto
que en un porcentaje de más del ochenta por ciento del material que va a parar
a los botaderos, ríos y mares, de las diferentes ciudades de Colombia se puede
reutilizar.
La transformación del conocimiento para resignificar la basura,
debe ser una nueva cultura de vida, donde se debe buscar como reto que las
personas tengan como objetivo indagar en ideas innovadoras de productos
construidos a través de los residuos. Para ello es importante utilizar nuevas
creaciones a partir del arte y el diseño. 
De esta idea nace la Universidad de la Basura, un espacio
creado para la educación ambiental generando productos útiles a la sociedad. 
La idea principal es crear un modelo de educación para
generar conocimiento en las personas, mientras cuidan el medio ambiente. 

DISEÑOS INNOVADORES 
Se busca que a través del conocimiento de los materiales
desechados y una capacitación intensiva en diseño que las personas generen
ideas de productos nuevos, para desarrollarlos y reintegrarlos a la sociedad. 
¿Qué se puede hacer con los residuos? Lo primero que se debe
hacer es una selección de la calidad, es decir, una separación inicial en la
fuente. Luego de la clasificación se debe mirar las propiedades de los
materiales, formas, esquemas, estructuras que tiene el mismo para empezar a
diseñar y crear, buscando una homogenización de las formas para crear
estructuras e ir fabricando nuevos elementos. Un ejemplo tangible son las
lámparas creadas a partir de PET (más conocido por sus siglas en inglés
PET, polyethylene terephtalate,  que
es un tipo de plástico, muy usado en envases de bebidas y textiles).
MATERIALES USADOS PARA CREAR NUEVOS PRODUCTOS
Hemos resignificado diversos materiales de desecho
convirtiéndolos en los siguientes productos:





Jardín Vertical creado con Botellas de PET





Estructura con partes de Botellas PET ámbar





Lámpara de techo fabricada con botellas PET cristal




Lámpara de techo a partir de botellas de PET cristal.



La bandera de Cali donde se utilizaron 22 mil botellas PET.



La ambientación realizada en los jardines infantiles de
Acunares, sensibilizándose a los niños a través del trabajo de la tierra y el
reciclaje. Trabajo realizado en conjunto con la Secretaria Distrital de
Integración Social (SDIS)



La bandera de Colombia, hecha con 40 mil botellas PET
recuperadas del río Cauca. Realizada para el centro comercial Andino, en la
ciudad de Bogotá.  
BENEFICIO AMBIENTAL Y SOCIAL
Cuantificar los beneficios que tiene para el planeta y las
futuras generaciones, el lograr tener conciencia ecológica, tal vez sea una
formula matemática que nos lleve a expresiones infinitas y resultaría tan
paradójico su resultado como querer cuantificar la  satisfacción que sentimos cuando ayudamos o
salvamos a alguien. Pero si queremos escribir los beneficios en un listado, estos
solo serían algunos de muchos:
1. 
Preservar la
naturaleza
2. 
Sanidad en
nuestro entorno
3. 
Salud
4. 
Economía de recursos
5. 
Inclusión social
6. 
Beneficios
monetarios
7. 
Desarrollo de
productos nuevos, útiles a la sociedad.
8. 
Generación de
conocimiento ambiental
HECHOS AMBIENTALES 
Cada ser humano produce 8.5 toneladas de basura en su vida,
al final terminamos botando mas empaques que los productos que realmente
consumimos. 


Biodegradación
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodegradation
RESIGNIFICAR, REUSAR Y RECICLAR
Estas son las tres reglas básicas que regirán el modelo de transmisión
de conocimiento por la Universidad de la Basura:
RESIGNIFICAR 
Proceso por el cual se toma los materiales desechados por las
personas y se les vuelve a dar un significado útil para la sociedad. 
REUSAR  
Reutilizar es la acción de volver a utilizar los bienes o
productos, y darles otro uso. 
http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reutilizaci%C3%B3n
RECICLAR
El reciclaje es un proceso cuyo objetivo es convertir
desechos en nuevos productos para prevenir el desuso de materiales
potencialmente útiles, reducir el consumo de nueva materia prima, reducir el
uso de energía, reducir la contaminación del aire (a través de la incineración)
y del agua (a través de los vertederos) por medio de la reducción de la
necesidad de los sistemas de desechos convencionales, así como también
disminuir las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero en comparación con la
producción de plásticos. El reciclaje es un componente clave en la reducción de
desechos contemporáneos y es el tercer componente de las 3R (“Reducir, Reutilizar,
Reciclar”).
http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciclaje
CERRANDO EL CICLO
Por medio de este modelo se busca completar el clico de
producción y como resultado que no se produzcan desechos, sino materia prima,
que será reutilizada en nuevos productos, generando una reducción en el consumo
de recursos naturales y evitando acumulación de estos materiales en los ríos,
mares y bosques. Para que los productos se recuperen por completo al final de
su vida útil. 


REQUISITO DE CONVIVENCIA
La idea es generar conciencia en las personas para generar
que la basura se convierta en un material deseado, a través del conocimiento de
los materiales para respetar su disposición final.  


LA CAMPAÑA DE INDIEGOGO
La Universidad de la Basura es una idea colombiana, desarrollada por la marca Error314 y la empresa de reciclaje G.S.U, que se unieron con un propósito en común para crear un modelo ambiental y social que genere un impacto positivo en nuestra sociedad.

<p>Iceland is
one of the very few nations that still allow the commercial killing of
some of nature's most impressive and vulnerable animals - the great
whales. <br/></p>
<p>Every year Icelandic whalers are allowed to kill up to 229 minke whales
and up to 154 <b><a href=""http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/2478/0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">endangered fin whales</a></b>.</p>
<p><b>Due to the
remoteness and inaccessibility of the whale hunts in Iceland, whaling
operations are largely shielded from public scrutiny and the public
perception of whaling activities is very much shaped by the information
that the whaling industry itself provides.</b></p>
<p> The industry
recognizes of course that whaling is far from uncontroversial.
Not only has the whale watching industry been growing in recent
years, drawing thousands of tourists to Iceland who want to observe
these majestic individuals in their natural habitat, but <b>an overwhelming
majority of Icelanders have expressed their concern for animal
welfare</b>. Images of animals that are hunted with explosive-spiked harpoons and
blown up to (allegedly) induce immediate cardiac arrest make for
very bad publicity and make it very hard to maintain the “humane
whaling” narrative.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>To protect
its own activities and to dispel concerns about the ethicality
of the slaughter of whales, who are killed for strictly commercial
purposes, the whaling industry has waged a systematic misinformation
campaign.<b> By deliberately controlling what information about this
hunt is released to the public, the pro-whaling lobby has so far managed
to quell an honest and critical debate about the defensibility
of whaling in Iceland. </b><br/></p>

<p>Due to the

<br/><h4>Exposure &amp; Attention - Effective tools against commercial whaling<br/>
</h4>
<p>Hard To Port’s<b> </b>Whaler Watching campaign uses a new approach
 in order to draw attention to the annual carnage of Icelandic wildlife.
 <b>We believe that legally-obtained, detailed documentation and media 
coverage has the potential to kick-start a much-needed public debate on 
the defensibility of commercial whaling in Iceland</b>. Our initiative focuses on the gathering and distribution of comprehensive data on the 
whaling operations. We believe that the Icelandic public and the rest of the international 
community have a right to receive unrestricted 
information about this controversial industry and about the sad and 
disturbing fate of these iconic animals. <b>We are confident that as we 
make our uncensored information more widely available, more people will 
join the call to end whaling in Iceland.</b></p>
<br/>
<h4>Education Is The Key To Change</h4>
<p>During the first phase of our Whaler Watching Campaign our team had the 
opportunity to talk to many Icelanders. We greatly appreciate the 
constructive exchange of opinions and information. As much as we are 
opposed to the cruel killing of these fascinating animals, we try to 
approach everyone with the same amount of respect, regardless of his or 
her opinion on whaling. We understand that to some Icelanders the issue 
of commercial whaling is a very sensitive topic. In addition to our planned sea-based documentation work<b> Hard To Port will set up a mobile contact point where people can argue and debate their views with us.</b> We will make sure that everyone, regardless of their views on whaling, 
is allowed to express their opinion, provided that all available 
information, evidence and footage is on the table.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4>Working With Local Communities &amp; Businesses <br/>
</h4>
<p>Collaboration and cooperation play a central role in our efforts to 
protect the whales in Iceland. Although the Icelandic government likes 
to portray the whaling industry as a national industry,<b> many Icelanders 
are in fact highly critical if not outright opposed to commercial 
whaling</b>. By working with local businesses and individuals who share our 
concern for the well-being of these fascinating animals, Hard To Port is
 building a strong and diverse coalition of voices who collectively 
speak out against whaling.<br/></p>

</div></div>","The Issue - The Hidden Slaughter Of Endangered Animals





Iceland is
one of the very few nations that still allow the commercial killing of
some of nature's most impressive and vulnerable animals - the great
whales. 
Every year Icelandic whalers are allowed to kill up to 229 minke whales
and up to 154 endangered fin whales.
Due to the
remoteness and inaccessibility of the whale hunts in Iceland, whaling
operations are largely shielded from public scrutiny and the public
perception of whaling activities is very much shaped by the information
that the whaling industry itself provides.
 The industry
recognizes of course that whaling is far from uncontroversial.
Not only has the whale watching industry been growing in recent
years, drawing thousands of tourists to Iceland who want to observe
these majestic individuals in their natural habitat, but an overwhelming
majority of Icelanders have expressed their concern for animal
welfare. Images of animals that are hunted with explosive-spiked harpoons and
blown up to (allegedly) induce immediate cardiac arrest make for
very bad publicity and make it very hard to maintain the “humane
whaling” narrative.


To protect
its own activities and to dispel concerns about the ethicality
of the slaughter of whales, who are killed for strictly commercial
purposes, the whaling industry has waged a systematic misinformation
campaign. By deliberately controlling what information about this
hunt is released to the public, the pro-whaling lobby has so far managed
to quell an honest and critical debate about the defensibility
of whaling in Iceland. 


Due to the
absence of a strong voice that counters the “humane whaling"" narrative, the
Icelandic pro-whaling lobby has so far been quite successful at getting its
desired message across. This was, for instance, attested by a 2013 poll
according to which almost 60 percent of Icelanders believe that the whale hunt
is carried out in a humane manner.
 Although
most Icelanders know that whales are still being hunted in Iceland, the
brutal practice of killing a whale itself remains a big mystery -
and without a doubt, the whaling industry wants to keep it that way. We
believe that the whaling industry’s deliberate misinformation
policy is directly responsible for the ongoing quiet acquiescence of the whale hunt in Iceland. To change this, in 2014 we threw down the gauntlet and began to directly
challenge the Icelandic whaling industry’s information monopoly.

Exposure & Attention - Effective tools against commercial whaling

Hard To Port’s Whaler Watching campaign uses a new approach
 in order to draw attention to the annual carnage of Icelandic wildlife.
 We believe that legally-obtained, detailed documentation and media 
coverage has the potential to kick-start a much-needed public debate on 
the defensibility of commercial whaling in Iceland. Our initiative focuses on the gathering and distribution of comprehensive data on the 
whaling operations. We believe that the Icelandic public and the rest of the international

<h3>South Carolina's first sharing library</h3>
<p>A library of things is a community sharing space filled with commonly needed, but not often used items such as home improvement and gardening tools, kitchen countertop appliances,  sewing machines and camping gear. Instead of buying and storing these things, you borrow them like a library book. (For visual examples from around the world keep scrolling.) </p>
<p>There are other sharing libraries around the world and a few exist in the southeast, but none yet exist in South Carolina. <a href=""https://chslot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Charleston Library of Things</a> is so excited to be the first, but we can't do it without your help! </p>
<h3><strong><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Our membership model benefits YOU:</span></strong></h3>
<p>Tool libraries and sharing libraries around the world have different fee structure models depending on what works best for them and for their community. Charleston Library of Things has chosen to have a sliding scale fee structure based on income.</p>
<p>For a low annual fee you can check out as much stuff as you want all year long. What that means is that you pay $1 for every thousand dollars you make annually and that’s your annual fee. So if your annual salary is $150,000 your annual fee is $150. If it’s $40,000 then your annual fee is $40. This makes the library accessible to the entire community at any income level. To put it in perspective, an annual fee of $150 is equivalent to the purchase of just one $3 coffee at your local cafe per week. <strong>(Simple math: 52 weeks in a year. 52 x $3 = $156)</strong><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1568478306/fgygf7jomyrvici8gs0z.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>You'll never have to prove your income. It's honor system and we trust everyone to behave responsibly. Other communities have implemented this sliding scale fee to their sharing libraries and it works! The collective range of contributions averages out and many people tend to give MORE than they need to once they see the value that the library brings to the community. <br/><br/>Once you’re signed up as a member, it works just like a book library. You check out an item for a set amount of time and bring it back before its due date so the next borrower can use it. It’s that simple.</p>
<h3>Beyond the library, here's how we're building COMMUNITY:</h3>
<p>This is the REALLY exciting part! In addition to having the library available to the community, our goal is to build community.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Repair cafes:</strong> We will be offering repair cafes so you can extend the life of the things you already own. We'll let you know ahead of each event what our team of experts can help fix for you. You bring the thing and sip some coffee while we repair.</li>
<li>
<strong>Community classes:</strong> We plan to offer new skills for using those items you’re borrowing. These classes will be community driven. You tell us what you want to learn the most and we'll curate a class offering to fit the biggest need.</li>
<li>
<strong>Sharing blog:</strong> We’ll have a blog on our website where you can brag about what you made or did with the items you borrowed! Did you go on a fun camping trip with your family? Maybe you discovered a talent you have that lends itself to you starting your own home grown business. Whatever you do. We want you to share it with us. Lifting up our community is what we're all about.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Why do we need a sharing library?</span></h3>
<p>1. We want to add value to your life by freeing you of the financial and spacial burden of ownership. The less ""stuff"" you own, the happier and more free you are as an individual. </p>
<p>2. We believe in the circular economy. ""A circular economy is an alternative to a traditional linear economy (make, use, dispose) in which we keep resources in use for as long as possible, extract the maximum value from them whilst in use, then recover and regenerate products and materials at the end of each service life."" (source: wrap.org.uk) </p>
<p>If we want to preserve the earth for generations to come, the time is now to take action.

To put it in perspective, an annual fee of $150 is equivalent to the purchase of just one $3 coffee at your local cafe per week. (Simple math: 52 weeks in a year. 52 x $3 = $156)
You'll never have to prove your income. It's honor system and we trust everyone to behave responsibly. Other communities have implemented this sliding scale fee to their sharing libraries and it works! The collective range of contributions averages out and many people tend to give MORE than they need to once they see the value that the library brings to the community. Once you’re signed up as a member, it works just like a book library. You check out an item for a set amount of time and bring it back before its due date so the next borrower can use it. It’s that simple.
Beyond the library, here's how we're building COMMUNITY:
This is the REALLY exciting part! In addition to having the library available to the community, our goal is to build community.


Repair cafes: We will be offering repair cafes so you can extend the life of the things you already own. We'll let you know ahead of each event what our team of experts can help fix for you. You bring the thing and sip some coffee while we repair.

Community classes: We plan to offer new skills for using those items you’re borrowing. These classes will be community driven. You tell us what you want to learn the most and we'll curate a class offering to fit the biggest need.

Sharing blog: We’ll have a blog on our website where you can brag about what you made or did with the items you borrowed! Did you go on a fun camping trip with your family? Maybe you discovered a talent you have that lends itself to you starting your own home grown business. Whatever you do. We want you to share it with us. Lifting up our community is what we're all about.


Why do we need a sharing library?
1. We want to add value to your life by freeing you of the financial and spacial burden of ownership. The less ""stuff"" you own, the happier and more free you are as an individual. 
2. We believe in the circular economy. ""A circular economy is an alternative to a traditional linear economy (make, use, dispose) in which we keep resources in use for as long as possible, extract the maximum value from them whilst in use, then recover and regenerate products and materials at the end of each service life."" (source: wrap.org.uk) 
If we want to preserve the earth for generations to come, the time is now to take action. Sharing libraries are a FUN way to participate in doing our part as responsible citizens!

What happens with your contribution:

The graph above shows initial first year start up and operating expenses. The bulk of the funding from this campaign will be used to purchase a bus so we can begin serving you as a mobile library. Though the goal is to eventually have at least one brick and mortar location, by starting mobile we can visit neighborhoods, farmer’s markets, and other community spaces in order to broaden our reach. The remainder of the finds will be used to pay for other operating expenses in order to get started such as insurance, gas, office supplies, and maintenance/large equipment purchases. 
This is what we had in mind for our mobile unit:
 
When we’re ready to stock it with tools, we will have a community tool drive to stock the bus! After we get our feet wet with tool lending (home improvement, garden, kitchen, and craft) we will explore adding other categories (such as camping equipment) based on community demand. After all, we're here for our local community and want to do our best to serve your specific needs. YOU get to decide how we grow!
FOR SPONSORS: See our Sponsor Level perks to creatively advertise your business on our bus, on our website, in our marketing materials, and at special eevtns. 


Risks & Challenges
Contributions are critical to our success!  If our campaign does not meet its goal by deadline, we may have a difficult time securing enough additional funding to open.
If worst case scenario happens and we are unable to proceed, then we will refund our backers and perks will not be fulfilled. 
Time contributions count too!

Want to give or help in some way, but out of cash? That's OK!
Help us reach our goal by being our street team! Share online and off with your friends, family, and micro-communities. Make sure to use the Indiegogo sharing tools!

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p><strong>Mission:</strong> OffBeet Compost diverts household, restaurant and commercial food scraps from going to traditional waste facilities (landfills &amp; incinerators) in the Greater Lowell Region.  We collect food scraps and bring them to our local composting site where food scraps are broken down into nutrient rich compost. Compost is then redistributed to participants and also sold to local farmers, gardeners and landscapers.</p> <p><strong>Vision:</strong> We are committed to creating a resilient green economy in Greater Lowell that generates local green jobs, empowers community members to be land stewards and contributes to an environmentally sustainable landscape.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>OffBeet Compost was originally born as a 3 month pilot that turned into a full blown company on April 20th.  We are proud of what we have accomplished in Greater Lowell in just a short time and are ready to take our next steps!</p>
<p>Needless to say, 40+ tons of food waste is a lot to compost with just a few pitchforks and shovels and now we need your help to raise money four our very own tractor!</p>
<ul>
<li>We plan to purchase a used skid steer bucket loader</li>
<li>This will help us turn our piles of food scraps into compost much more quickly and effectively</li>
<li>Used skid steers in good condition typically cost around $20,000 and so far we have reached half of the funds needed to reach our goal!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By supporting OffBeet Compost, you will be supporting a movement towards a more sustainable future.  By sustainable, we don't just mean a future in which we are no longer combatting climate change, but also a  future where all people have access to fresh, affordable, culturally appropriate food and can dispose of it locally for the added benefit of replenishing our soils.  </p>
<p>We also mean a future where by supporting your local composter, you are investing in the regeneration of our soils, the enrichment of the food we eat and the strengthening of our economy by keeping the dollar longer in the community. We hope that OffBeet Compost helps foster the feeling that community isn't just a place where we live, but a place where we are all connected!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are William, Mary, our 4 year old daughter Maia, our 4 lovely dogs and 2 cats, we are a Venezuelan family that for many years we find ourselves in the search for a more sustainable life, since the year 2010 we live in a beautiful mountain in the Venezuelan Andes where we recover and rehabilitate a natural area that was being used like garbage dump. Today we have our house which we build ourselves using the resources we find around, much recycling and permaculture techniques. We have also developed a family garden and edible forest that have helped us to be more independent and autonomous in our food, especially because of the situation that is happening Venezuela.</p>
<p> Today we are dedicated to teaching and promoting different ancestral, techniques of sustainability and permaculture in our community, through workshops, courses and guided tours to our home where we have founded the “Demonstrative Center for Sustainable Life”.</p>

 Children will be inspired to
share their learning with their families and local communities, spreading the
impact of this project through communities across Rodrigues.


  Coral reefs not only provide a
source of food, they also provide physical protection from extreme weather
events. Therefore by encouraging sustainable fishing and marine protection,
this project will protect the future livelihoods of Rodriguan communities.

<h3>How We Can Make a Change for the Better &amp; Define a New Kind of BAAH'D<br/>
</h3>I noticed a demand for Organic Weed Management when I started working in the Environmental Industry nearly a decade ago. I had a first hand look at what we were being exposed to and the impact it was having on us and our planet.<br/><br/>We are providing a solution. A real, eco-friendly, cost effective solution that really works, actually it works better. 95% reduction of Weeds. We are taking toxic, ineffective chemicals out of the equation and protecting our water, soil and bodies. Lets save our land, save money and lower healthcare costs. Check out several other Advantages on our <a href=""OrganicWeedControl.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Website</a> or here in <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/1y2i6z9spk6mopv/Advantages%20BPM%26R.pdf?dl=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/77vte37lhwjp89r/BPM%26R%20Brochure%20e-mail.pdf?dl=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Our Brochure</a>.<br/><br/>We use goats to target browse weeds. We live on-site with them in a eco-friendly 128 sqft tiny house. Our house is made of all up-cycled material and anything new we had made locally in Alberta. We recently took on a contract with the City of Calgary. The story broke and in moments went viral. By days end I was featured in 2 National Papers and T.V. Broadcasts. CBC radio, and 10 Alberta media outlets including CTV and Globals nightly news. I was interviewed again by another 3 reports yesterday and today. For Earth day I was featured on CBC Calgary Shaw Cable. My<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/OrganicWeedControlManagementReclamation/?ref=aymt_homepage_panel"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Baah'd Plant Management &amp; Reclamation Facebook</a> hits went from 68 to over 2000 in less than 24 hours, twitter erupted. I am a leader in Alberta for bringing non-toxic weed management to commercial, rural and urban landscapes.  There is some great momentum we can do this and you can be a HUGE part of it! <br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Here it is in more detail:</p> <ul> <li>Our bank and other potential investors are so excited about our business plan. It makes so much sense. So why do we need a crowd funding site? Well, because this business plan is so different, it doesn't fit into their normal boxes. We cant include the goats in with the loan. The bank wants the goats labeled as agriculture. We need to raise separate money to cover those costs. <br/>
</li> <li>We liquidated almost everything we own in a massive estate sale. We have raised half of the start-up costs and have purchased many of the assets we will need already. Consider nearly half of the project already funded by us. We just need help bringing the last bit home. <br/>
</li>
<li>Help us make this a reality and give this to western Canada.<br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know the difference their contribution will make:</p> <ul> <li>
<ul>
<li>In
2001, nearly 5 billion pounds of chemicals were used worldwide to kill weeds
and insects; only 5% reached its destination. 
Today studies show that glyphosate, the chief ingredient in Roundup, has
been shown to cause Infertility, Birth Defects, Cancers, Parkinson’s, Autism,
Alzheimer’s, Diabetes, overall negative impacts on bodily function and
resistant bacteria and plants. The EPA reports in 2007, 185 million pounds of
glyphosate was used by U.S. farmers. It is apparent that we are in crisis. 

The
Canada Food Inspection Agency reported in 2002 that Leafy spurge alone reduced
the value of land in Alberta and Saskatchewan by 30 million dollars. This is
not including the 19 million dollars for lost yield, recreation and weed
management. For the timber industry, even moderate infestations can reduce the
growth of tree and shrub seedlings by 50-75% according to Alberta 

Agriculture and Forestry. The billions of dollars lost
each year due to invasive weeds and the billions now spent on healthcare as a
result of chemical exposure are evidence that we are fighting a losing battle.
It’s time to change our strategy. </li>
<li>Target browsing is a 
form of organic weed
management that can be a solution to all of these problems. There is a 
95% reduction of weeds and it usually costs less. The best part, is 
there are no toxic chemicals! We can leave our environment clean and not
 have to worry about our children and pets playing in toxic parks or 
tracking toxic chemicals into our houses and cars. <a href=""http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2687236448/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Advantages on the Radio of our program in Calgary.</a>The liability is 
greatly reduced and it can be used in sensitive areas like waterbodies, 
hospitals and playgrounds. Goats can access steep hills mowers and 
spraying cant and they work in more types of weather than mowing or 
spraying. Unlike other weed control options, goats don't destroy the 
soil, they enhance it. Chemicals accummulate in the soil and change the pH, causing metals and nutrients to leach away. 
You don't have to worry about amending soil with fertilizer after, or 
fertilizers washing into our waterways.  Goats prefer weeds and enhance 
native forages for wildlife and grasses for other livestock. Goats can help with firesmart programs. Any way you
 cut it, goats are amazing gardeners.</li>
</ul> <br/>You can help us be a better type of Baah'd. You can help us take back our environment and help our economy.<br/><br/><br/>
</li>
</ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> Our greatest challenge is the misconception about goats and educating clients. The concept may be hard to grasp for some folks, we have to work hard to ensure anyone interested in hiring us has all the information so they may present it to any clients or board of directors. <br/></p>
<p>We have to stay one step ahead of any negative media coverage, one job gone wrong could have a detrimental effect on the whole industry. We want to work with any other goat owners who might be interested in starting up a weed management program. We are after all trying to bring positive change the world. <br/></p> <ul> <li>Our website is very informative and set up to facilitate sharing among co-workers and board members.

Someone said, 'It is time.' As I navigated between the adults to get to a place where I could see, it seemed as if everyone was holding their breath. I dropped to my hands and knees and crawled across the cool sand. The crowd parted and I could see the slight depression. A collective 'ahh' sounded as a single Loggerhead sea turtle escaped its sandy nest. With that first escape, the unseen mob below must have felt inspired because within seconds, a volcanic explosion of baby sea turtles erupted...</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1193992/files/20150203123650-20140817_210504.jpg?1422995810"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Hello, my name is Alek and I'm 12 years old. I have been tasked with completing a year long research project for my 6th grade year. My inspiration came from the story above and seeing the described Loggerhead sea turtle nest hatch. </p>
<p>The volunteers that were on the beach that night, as well as many other nights, watching and waiting for numerous other nests to hatch were with the Navarre Beach Sea Turtle Conservation Center (NBSTCC). They are an incredible group of dedicated volunteers that work tirelessly to protect sea turtles and other marine life. Although I live near Boston, MA, I want to help. </p>
<p>I realized that although I am only 12, I can make a difference in the future of sea turtles, marine life and our beautiful planet. I am now asking for the world's help in my goal of financially helping the NBSTCC's mission. Show your support for my goal, contribute today and help save a sea turtle.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
</div><div> <p>My goal is simple, expose the NBSTCC to a world-wide audience that may not otherwise get a chance to hear about this great organization.</p>
<p>100% of all funds raised will go directly to NBSTC. </p>
<p>  </p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The mission of the NBSTCC is the conservation and protection of threatened and endangered sea turtles through community education pograms and partnered research.</p>
<p>Your contribution will go towards operating expenses, educational materials, merchandise for the Seamore Store, event expenses such as beach cleanups, summer camps and kids' activities. </p>
<p><br/></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary About two dozen people waited around a small roped off section of beach. Someone said, 'It is time.' As I navigated between the adults to get to a place where I could see, it seemed as if everyone was holding their breath. I dropped to my hands and knees and crawled across the cool sand. The crowd parted and I could see the slight depression. A collective 'ahh' sounded as a single Loggerhead sea turtle escaped its sandy nest. With that first escape, the unseen mob below must have felt inspired because within seconds, a volcanic explosion of baby sea turtles erupted...

Hello, my name is Alek and I'm 12 years old. I have been tasked with completing a year long research project for my 6th grade year. My inspiration came from the story above and seeing the described Loggerhead sea turtle nest hatch. 
The volunteers that were on the beach that night, as well as many other nights, watching and waiting for numerous other nests to hatch were with the Navarre Beach Sea Turtle Conservation Center (NBSTCC). They are an incredible group of dedicated volunteers that work tirelessly to protect sea turtles and other marine life. Although I live near Boston, MA, I want to help. 
I realized that although I am only 12, I can make a difference in the future of sea turtles, marine life and our beautiful planet. I am now asking for the world's help in my goal of financially helping the NBSTCC's mission. Show your support for my goal, contribute today and help save a sea turtle.

What We Need & What You Get
 My goal is simple, expose the NBSTCC to a world-wide audience that may not otherwise get a chance to hear about this great organization.
100% of all funds raised will go directly to NBSTC. 
  
  The Impact
The mission of the NBSTCC is the conservation and protection of threatened and endangered sea turtles through community education pograms and partnered research.
Your contribution will go towards operating expenses, educational materials, merchandise for the Seamore Store, event expenses such as beach cleanups, summer camps and kids' activities. 

  Risks & Challenges  People are always being asked to contribute to causes. This is a grass roots effort by me, a 12 year old, who wants to make a positive impact on sea turtles and the world.     Other Ways You Can Help If you would like to contribute in other ways, make an effort to go to Navarre Beach, Florida, stop in the NBSTCC and ask how you can help.

climate change.<br/></i><i>           I met Gleb Raygorodetsky

climate change, it is precisely the resilience of indigenous cultures to the
historical changes of humanity and the planet which should be cause for
reflection, learning, empathy, and solidarity. Gleb's book is obligatory

I’ve spent the last two decades working with Indigenous peoples around the world, with the last two years devoted to doing research and collecting materials for the book. I've got half of the book written, but I need to dive deeper into some of the stories
before I can deliver the finished draft to the publisher in early 2016. THIS IS WHERE YOU COME IN! I need your help to raise funds to enable me to go
back to some of the Indigenous communities I write about in the book. I will conduct more interviews, update the stories, and spend time on the
land with local people to better understand what it’s like to live at the edge
of our changing planet. And I will SHARE WHAT I LEARN with the supporters like YOU, so that you become not only a BACKER (for which I would be eternally grateful!), but also an ACTIVE PARTICIPANT on this journey (which will make it all worthwhile!)But first, let me tell you why this book is important.                                _____________________A restless and courageous chronicler of some of the world’s most endangered communities, Gleb Raygorodetsky is uniquely qualified to document not just the threat of climate change, but the remarkable leadership of Indigenous peoples who occupy the front lines of the most important battle of our time. Their resilience is a gift to us all, and Gleb’s work to document and share their knowledge will be a vital guide to help us save us from ourselves. Ian Gill  - Founding president of Ecotrust Canada, Author of All That We Say Is Ours.                                                                       _____________________ABOUT THE ARCHIPELAGO OF HOPELess than two generations ago scientists were just beginning to consider the possibility of a world under a changing climate, yet, Indigenous peoples were already raising the alarm about climate change, because of the changes they were observing on their lands and seas.Today, the rest of the world is slowly waking up to the reality of climate change, yet we remain largely ignorant of what it really means for us and our children's children.To really understand the meaning of unfolding changes, we must pay closer attention to the experiences of those people for whom climate change has long been not just a political slogan, a model prediction, or a fundraising strategy, but a reality of their daily lives.  We must learn from Indigenous peoples.A mere 4% of the world’s population, Indigenous peoples look after traditional territories that cover as much as 20% of the Earth’s surface, supporting over 3/4 of our planet’s remaining biodiversity.Indigenous communities are islands of bio-cultural diversity rising
above the ever-surging seas of development and urbanization. Though removed from
each other geographically, these refugia of biological and cultural richness are interlinked into one ARCHIPELAGO OF HOPE by the very nature and
history of the symbiotic relationship between Indigenous peoples and the EARTH.From the original STEWARDS of this ARCHIPELAGO, we can learn not only what it takes to live with climate change, but also how to live on Earth in a way so that our wellbeing is not dependent on the disruption of the planetary live-sustaining balance.The  book ARCHIPELAGO OF HOPE  documents
my search for hopeful stories of Indigenous peoples' resilience from the frontlines of climate
change:From the
mountains, the homeland of Altai peoples in Russia,To the coastal
territory of the Tla-o-qui-aht people in western Canada, From the boreal
landscapes, the home of the Skolt Sami in Finland, 

To the ancestral
rainforests of Sapara people in Ecuador.We have much to learn from the experiences of Indigenous peoples living with, and crafting
creative solutions to, the challenges of climate change. 



I HOPE you can JOIN ME on this journey!
By SUPPORTING the ARCHIPELAGO OF HOPE you can help bring these all-important stories of climate change resilience to the global audience, so that we can all LEARN from the experiences of the peoples who have been living with climate change for decades.

Archipelago of Hope is at once a clarion call for action and an inspirational compendium of steps that indigenous peoples around the world are taking to address the world’s changing climate. We have much to learn from the peoples whom Gleb Raygorodetsky has met and his elegant, evocative writing will immerse the reader in the places and experiences of those peoples. Dr. Eleanor J.

HOW WILL I USE YOUR FUNDS?
I am VERY GRATEFUL for your support!

Your generous contribution will enable me to travel to the communities and spend time with local people, conduct interviews, and create a visual record of my journey. 

Any funds I raise in excess of this campaign's goals, as well as all
of the royalties I earn from the sale of the book, will go directly toward helping the
Indigenous communities I have been privileged to work with over the years.
These and other funds I manage to raise, will be directed  toward supporting the ARCHIPELAGO
OF HOPE project, through my long-term and trusted partner in this work, a non-profit Indigenous rights coalition LAND IS LIFE, in order to raise awareness of climate change and provide direct support to the communities featured in the book.

KUDOS TO ARCHIPELAGO OF HOPE 



             There is an absolute beautiful interdependence and connection
between the oceans, the soil, the air, the plants, animals, forests and all
living things, including ourselves. Somehow many of us have forgotten it.
Indigenous peoples wisdom, knowledge and way of life hold a key for us to
remembering it and therefore have absolute contemporary relevance to modern
society!!!!!!             Traditionally, Indigenous peoples have lived in harmony with
Mother Earth without exploiting and destroying their children’s future. Today,
Indigenous peoples all around the world are on the ""frontlines"" of
climate change and globalization. They are the gatekeepers to the last pristine
places on Earth, where forests, minerals, water, and biodiversity are still
abundant. There is much to learn from indigenous peoples’ traditional ways of
life and there is much to reflect on when we listen to their stories about
climate change.           I met Gleb Raygorodetsky
as we both worked in our own ways to help amplify and empower Indigenous
peoples voices. I am looking forward to the important impact I know his book
“Archipelago of Hope“ will have as a tool to share stories, lessons and
messages our Indigenous brothers and sisters around the world hope to share
with all of us and all future generations. Thank you Gleb for your dedication,
research and open heart!  Q’orianka Kilcher– Actress, Singer, Community Organizer |
Action Hero Network





When Indigenous Peoples meet one another for the first time it’s as if we’ve always known each other.  Gleb’s powerful and knowledgeable book captures that essence and the intimate ties we have to our Mother Earth.  This book is like reading my own ancestry.  We say that “all things are connected” and these stories show us how related we all are.  Patricia Cochrane – Inupiat Eskimo, USA | Executive Director, Alaska Native Science Commission.     
As climate evolves from blessing to threat, and masses of humanity build levies and fortresses to protect themselves from something they will simply make worse with their efforts, Gleb Raygorodetsky takes us back to the communities we all descended from, in search of wisdom long forgotten about the the planet-wide ecosystem that sustains us, the one whose friend is climate. Mark Dowie - Writer and award-winning journalist, including four National Magazine Awards. Author of Conservation Refugees.
There could be no more accurate or prescient way to see our climatic future than through the eyes of Indigenous culture, people whose survival depends directly on the intimacy with which they interact with living systems. In Archipelago, longtime inhabitants of earth give us their eyes and ears, and we, who can be dumbfounded by an overwhelming onslaught of information, find a precious wisdom that is bestowed to those who patiently abide in the life of the world. Paul Hawken - environmentalist, entrepreneur, journalist, and a best-selling writer. Author of the Blessed Unrest.
Gleb Raygorodetsky has spent his life immersed in the trials and dreams of indigenous peoples around the world. ARCHIPELAGO OF HOPE presents his personal and professional experiences and insights in a lively and compelling set of stories from around the world. Much has been written about climate change, but little that displays the conviction, passion, and depth that Gleb brings to this task. Ultimately, his message is one of optimism: there is still time to act, if only we can show the patience and commitment to listen and learn from those, like Gleb, who have taken the time to earn their wisdom.  Henry Huntington - co-author of The Meaning of Ice and contributor to the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment and the Arctic Biodiversity Assessment.
Gleb Raygorodetsky, with his in-depth experience and knowledge, provides a framework on the climate issues that is at the heart  of Indigenous Peoples and Youth's experiences worldwide. Building on Gleb's vision, dedication and passion for this work and advocacy, the Archipelago of Hope will inspire and bring hope to people around the world.  Marifel  Macalanda –
Igorot, Philippines |  Cordillera Youth Center (CYC), Asia Pacific Indigenous Youth Network (APIYN).
This finite blue-green planet creaks under growing pressure. Solutions to world problems must come from within: we will all need to find ways of living that have a light touch on the planet, and yet at the same time bring well-being and contentment. This fine book develops a much-needed narrative of hope. There are peoples in diverse cultures worldwide who have insights and solutions. We should listen and learn. Dr. Jules Pretty, OBE, Deputy Vice-Chancellor and Professor of Environment & Society, University of Essex | 
Author of The Edge of Extinction.
Gleb Raygorodetsky's journey through indigenous peoples of five continents shines an empathetic and sensitive light on the deepest sources of wisdom that we still have left on earth. While climate change is the focus, it is clear that such peoples have much to teach the rest of us about how to live responsibly towards the rest of nature, and towards each other. Powerful images and clear prose, both based Gleb's obvious immersion in the lives of these peoples, makes this book enormously educative, useful, and delightful.  Ashish Kothari - Founder-member Kalpavriksh Environment Action Group.
Nothing could better represent this journey through
the world than its title: Archipelago of
Hope. Although scattered throughout the world in oceans of change and
conventional development, indigenous cultures are today - perhaps more than
ever, islands of hope - for their historical roots, for their intimate
connection with the land, for their wisdom and especially their resilience.
This is what communicates the book by Gleb Raygorodetsky: beyond today's
climate change, it is precisely the resilience of indigenous cultures to the
historical changes of humanity and the planet which should be cause for
reflection, learning, empathy, and solidarity. Gleb's book is obligatory
reading for all those interested in studying and appreciating traditional
cultures and their histories with nature, and for helping shape a vision for
the future of the Earth.  Gonzalo Oviedo – Senior Advisor, Policy Program, IUCN -
International Union for Conservation of Nature. 
Few non-native people understand the sacred ancient connection indigenous people have with Mother Earth better than Gleb Raygorodetsky. Here in the inimitable clarity and style for which we know him from his National Geographic Voices blog, Gleb takes us to every inhabited continent, to meet and converse with people who are witnessing the impact of climate change on ecosystems they have related with for countless generations.

Yet it is in these same forgotten corners of the world that Gleb also finds traditional knowledge of our planetary organism may well be our species' ultimate lifeline. David Maxwell-Braun, Editor, National Geographic Voices.

Paris, 28 November 2015. In the aftershock of two weeks back, security for the COP21 is tight as never before. All public events speaking to Climate Change and for a Good Life on the planet, are banned.  
Just on the other side of Paris the World Wisdom Gathering stands like a rock!Telling the new unfolding story. How people have already started to heal, adapt, restore and innovate a healthy and habitable planet. Elders who, in their wisdom, protect the old knowledge, making it available. Others, young people who just follow a different drum.If you want this last place in Paris to speak out for humanity, loud and clear and share a very powerful message, a message for each of you, stay tuned and support your future!

Why we invited indigenous peoples.
Today they are at the forefront of protecting rivers, forests and land. They have proven to be excellent caretakers of Mother Earth as their territories belong to the most healthy areas of this planet. Ceremonies are their sacred way to maintain the balance with all that is living. We honor them for their willingness to share the ancient wisdom with us.

 ”System 4™- the new generation of buildings” we will be honored to

 an example more than $220 billion is spent each year in the U.S. to 
provide heating, cooling, lighting and related services for buildings. </p><p>Energy
 consumption in residential and commercial buildings is a major cause of
 acid rain, smog and global warming, accounting for 47% of U.S. sulfur 
dioxide emissions, 22% of nitrogen oxide emissions and 35% of carbon 
dioxide emissions.</p><p>Based on program analysis conducted for the 
Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), an annual Federal 
investment of $300 million to improve the energy efficiency of buildings
 in the U.S. will:</p><p>• Save consumers a cumulative $65 billion by 2016 and over $320 billion by 2026 in energy expenditures.</p><p>• Reduce carbon annual emissions by over 45 million metric tons in 2016, and by 124 million metric tons in 2026.</p><p>• Provide comfortable and healthy indoor environments, improve worker productivity and reduce on-site construction waste.</p><p>• Increase competitiveness for the building industry and stimulate economic activity in communities.</p><div align=""center"">

THINK DIFFERENT We are proud to introduce”System 4™ - the new generation of buildings”A
 great nation is one that buzzes with ideas, one that is full of 
innovative people doing big things, one that is ready to change!With
 ”System 4™- the new generation of buildings” we will be honored to 
contribute to the United States of America´s strategy to improve 
building energy efficiency, striving towards a 21st century energy 
independence. Fact Buildings consume 54% of all energy used in the world.As
 an example more than $220 billion is spent each year in the U.S. to 
provide heating, cooling, lighting and related services for buildings. Energy
 consumption in residential and commercial buildings is a major cause of
 acid rain, smog and global warming, accounting for 47% of U.S. sulfur 
dioxide emissions, 22% of nitrogen oxide emissions and 35% of carbon 
dioxide emissions.Based on program analysis conducted for the 
Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), an annual Federal 
investment of $300 million to improve the energy efficiency of buildings
 in the U.S. will:• Save consumers a cumulative $65 billion by 2016 and over $320 billion by 2026 in energy expenditures.• Reduce carbon annual emissions by over 45 million metric tons in 2016, and by 124 million metric tons in 2026.• Provide comfortable and healthy indoor environments, improve worker productivity and reduce on-site construction waste.• Increase competitiveness for the building industry and stimulate economic activity in communities.

Will System 4 work on any foundation?The building’s anchoring system accommodates any type of foundation.
Will I be able to choose a different building size?We're also working to provide users
future option with different styles and models. 

Can system 4 be attached to me existing home, as an in-law house?Yes and no, we only have a few systems, but you are able to attach the
system to your home or garage... anything is possible - all you need to do is
skip the walk-through or door opening of System 4 the new generation of
buildings.

How long does it take to build the shed, garage
or tiny home bungalow?It differs in time, due to the fact that they are all different shape and
sizes. It takes less than two hours for the shed. On your first DIY assembling
kit it would take some time, but you will experience fun while building with
System 4.

Will
there be contractor team – to build my assembling kit?We are
working on contractor teams; they are the first to know how to build quick and
easy, as it comes available.
Do I need to paint the inside or outside walls?No. but it would look much better if painted.
The outside siding is unfinished with no protecting paint, so if you ask me if

and it definitely would look much better. 
Some assembling kits come with drywall, so if you like to give it a
better look, paint it. We would for sure.

<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p>My name is Za'Ria Thomas I am a 5-year Navy veteran and plant-loving herbalist from Jacksonville, FL.</p>
<p>My campaign is to fund my small business, My Melanin Skincare, which plans to become a non-health compromising, clean beauty skincare line tailored to catering and maintaining the health and appearance of melanin skin. While also giving people of color in lower income communities and urban neighborhoods the knowledge and resources to recycle and understand how their environmental impact also affects their skin and health. As a unisex product line we promise fewer organic, recycled, non-toxic, affordable ingredients tailored to those of darker skin tones and their specific needs. While simultaneously fighting climate change by giving communities not granted recycling bins and environmental resources the option to contribute to a healthier planet. Not only for the success of our company but for the success of their skincare journey, and providing the building blocks to black generational knowledge, success, and health. Since clean beauty is a popular term with no standard definition, we decided to ignore the fad and instead... create a movement. </p>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p><br/>We need $15,000 to successfully start up our company. The funds are needed for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Branding and design</li>
<li>Website</li>
<li>Photography</li>
<li>Samples &amp; Testers</li>
<li>Marketing contribution to retailers</li>

<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p><br/> My Melanin skincare is beyond the trend of opening another organic line. It's about creating generational knowledge and resources for the urban community. Being a woman of color who has lived in both urban, lower class neighborhoods and modern, upper class neighborhoods, she sees the difference between health awareness and resource in the nation. People of color are shown to be the top spender in the beauty world, but yet still struggle to find safe, non-health compromising, organic skincare products that are affordable for the average middle to lower-class woman to keep up a regime. African Americans in the green industry also are beginning to address the lack of diversity. Black and Latina women have paraben levels 4x-8x higher than the general population due to the lack of clean skincare out there for us. People in Urban neighborhoods would have to live in subdivisions with HOA in order to receive recycling bins, and sometimes you'd still have to request that. The standard products one buys from the beauty industry are also contributing 120 billion units of plastic packaging annually, making it one of the top generators of plastic waste while using tons of water to create their products as well. Adding to the water crisis while the beauty industry, in terms of recycling and proper waste disposal, gives little-to-no effort.</p>
<p>  Since the FDA does not regulate a standard definition for ""clean skincare"", Za'Ria sought out to come up with a fresh concept. A clean, tailored BLACK skincare line must be health imperative from the outside in. Considering how the product benefits the skin and the community before and after the formula is received. From the product within the package to the package itself. As well as in the lives of our team and our customers. Teaming up with companies like ""Ocean Waste Plastic"" to reuse plastic waste in their packaging and reinvent a better, healthier future for melanated people and people of all colors, sizes, and shapes. Pushing other skincare companies to reuse plastic instead of producing more. Cleaning the ocean, and improving our environment which in return has a direct affect on the skin. </p>
<p>""The direct impacts of climate change on the skin include the effects of extreme weather events such as heavy rainfall, floods, droughts, and hurricanes, which can attribute to an increase in skin infections, inflammatory skin diseases, and traumatic skin disorders.""

<h3>Hi there!</h3>
<p>My name is Giuseppe, I'm a small olive grower in Tuscany, Italy. </p>
<p>I started in 2010, restoring two olive groves which where abandoned since many many years. I settled down with my family in Montepescini, an old hamlet south from Siena. Here we produce oil since 2012 under our own label <a href=""http://www.olivetadellatorre.it/landing/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Oliveta della Torre</a>, and we're certified organic olive grover and oil producers since 2015. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471905756/s0mo5poai8sysbhcedpn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>You surely know Tuscany, a beautiful region and one of the top touristic destinations in the world.</p>
<p>But unfortunately the rural areas here are suffering an impoverishment which becomes more and more visible. And the abandon of olive trees is getting <a href=""http://www.greenreport.it/news/clima/in-toscana-4-milioni-di-olivi-abbandonati-valgono-40-milioni-di-euro/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">worse and worse every year</a>.</p>
<p>The main causes for this disease are the production costs, which are the highest in Europe, and the commercialization of low cost EVOOs. </p>
<p>To act against this impoverishment we decided to restore an olive grove with 90 old trees and enough land to plant 200 new ones.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471906242/c0ccol93dcho3bewdsax.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<li>  7'500 euros for the purchase and plantation of at least 100 olive trees</li>

<p>In all cases, you'll have the right to give a name to the adopted tree; the tree itself will bear a plaque with your name and, mostly of all, you'll receive at home a tin of exquisite, <strong>healthy and true tuscan oil</strong>, that we produce under <strong>our own organic label ""<a href=""http://www.olivetadellatorre.it/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Oliveta della Torre</a>""</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What if we don't make it?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>If we don't reach the entire goal, we'll use the funds raised to purchase only the olive orchard, or to purchase the olive orchard and only one part of the junior trees, or to buy only the mechanical equipment. In all cases, <u>the value of our organic olive estate will increase thanks to your investment!!</u> </p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Climate change and risks</h3>
<p>Agriculture depends heavily on weather conditions and on seasonality. Due to the climate change, in the last years we've had mild winters, rainy springs and very dry summers. This has lead to extreme weather, like <a href=""https://youtu.be/q94m4GC06Rc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">hailstorms</a>, or to different diseases in the orchards, like bacteria, fungus and damaging insects. </p>
<p>According to the disciplinary of organic growing, we don't use any sort of pesticide, so that we must take in account losses of production compared to conventional olive farming. </p>
<p>We've partially fixed the problem taking out an insurance against damage caused by natural forces, but it doesn't cover the pathologies that affect the olive trees: olive fruit fly, bacteria and fungus are the main threat for an organic farmed olive groves.</p>
<p>As there are no ways to foresee such diseases,  we must take in account the fact that we may not be able to deliver your oil during 2017. But we would manage to do that over a period of three years: from 2017 to 2019, which corresponds to the adoption period of the olive trees. In any case, from January 2017, we'll take contact with you to arrange an individual delivery period.</p>

<h2>Thank you for all the support you can give us!</h2>
<p> </p>
</div></div>","Hi there!
My name is Giuseppe, I'm a small olive grower in Tuscany, Italy. 
I started in 2010, restoring two olive groves which where abandoned since many many years. I settled down with my family in Montepescini, an old hamlet south from Siena. Here we produce oil since 2012 under our own label Oliveta della Torre, and we're certified organic olive grover and oil producers since 2015. 

You surely know Tuscany, a beautiful region and one of the top touristic destinations in the world.
But unfortunately the rural areas here are suffering an impoverishment which becomes more and more visible. And the abandon of olive trees is getting worse and worse every year.
The main causes for this disease are the production costs, which are the highest in Europe, and the commercialization of low cost EVOOs. 
To act against this impoverishment we decided to restore an olive grove with 90 old trees and enough land to plant 200 new ones.

It's a win win project, you, us and for the Environment:
Our gain
With your support we'll be able to

purchase the olive orchard,
buy new olive plants, and
increase our oil production. 

Your gain
In change of your investment you'll

get a certificate of adoption for 3 years,
give the name to the adopted tree,
visit it whenever you want, and most of all
receive at home one of the highest quality olive oil in the world.


Environmental gain
Thanks to your support and our farming skills, we'll be able to 

restore an uncultivated olive grove,
contribute to increase the potential carbon sequestration and slow the accumulation of greenhouse gases.


 
What We Need & What You Get
We need 40'000 euros, which'll be allocated as follows:

20'000 euros for the purchase of the olive orchard
  7'500 euros for the purchase and plantation of at least 100 olive trees
 12'500 euros for the purchase of mechanical olive picking equipment 

For your precious support, you'll get high value perks: from 30 to 300 euros, you can choose to adopt for a period of three years
an entire, a half or a fourth of a Senior Olive Tree,

 
or you can adopt an entire or a half Junior Olive Tree.

In all cases, you'll have the right to give a name to the adopted tree; the tree itself will bear a plaque with your name and, mostly of all, you'll receive at home a tin of exquisite, healthy and true tuscan oil, that we produce under our own organic label ""Oliveta della Torre"".
 
What if we don't make it?
 
If we don't reach the entire goal, we'll use the funds raised to purchase only the olive orchard, or to purchase the olive orchard and only one part of the junior trees, or to buy only the mechanical equipment. In all cases, the value of our organic olive estate will increase thanks to your investment!! 
 
Climate change and risks
Agriculture depends heavily on weather conditions and on seasonality. Due to the climate change, in the last years we've had mild winters, rainy springs and very dry summers. This has lead to extreme weather, like hailstorms, or to different diseases in the orchards, like bacteria, fungus and damaging insects. 
According to the disciplinary of organic growing, we don't use any sort of pesticide, so that we must take in account losses of production compared to conventional olive farming. 
We've partially fixed the problem taking out an insurance against damage caused by natural forces, but it doesn't cover the pathologies that affect the olive trees: olive fruit fly, bacteria and fungus are the main threat for an organic farmed olive groves.
As there are no ways to foresee such diseases,  we must take in account the fact that we may not be able to deliver your oil during 2017. But we would manage to do that over a period of three years: from 2017 to 2019, which corresponds to the adoption period of the olive trees. In any case, from January 2017, we'll take contact with you to arrange an individual delivery period.
 
Your support is paramount

Please consider supporting our work as students and members of a broader research community. Our travel costs are not covered by grant funding. Anything you contribute is greatly appreciated! Phil HydePhil completed his BS in Ecology and Environmental Science at Evergreen State College in 2019.  He conducted undergraduate research on the effects of urbanization on bird diversity in the Southern Puget Sound Region of Washington State, United States. He is trained in Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship (MAPS) bird-banding protocol. Phil chose his academic direction based on a calling to protect nature and wildlife and is pursuing a career in conservation biology. Laura Giannone Laura is completing a BAS in Sound Engineering and Acoustic Ecology at Evergreen State (2020). She is a field recordist, field technician for Quiet Parks International, freelance sound engineer, and intern with Northwest Soundscapes. Since winter 2019 she has assisted with University of Washington researcher Lauren Kuehne's study on the impact of flights over the North Olympic Peninsula in Washington. Laura helps with citizen science workshops to teach local volunteers to process acoustic data and acoustic analysis. She worked as the lead editor for Quiet Planet (2013-2016), a library of wilderness recordings. Laura is developing waterproof housing and C cell battery holder modifications for ten Open Acoustic Devices' AudioMoth recorders so they are ready for heavy rainfall and extended stays on trees in Borneo this Fall.   Bow TylerBow is completing a BS in Ecology with an emphasis in Ornithology at Evergreen State College. He is an experienced bird-bander, field technician, and avid hiker. Bow is particularly interested in avian vocal behavior, migration, and population dynamics.  He studied conservation biology at Navopatia Field Station in Sonora, Mexico (2018). Bow trained in Monitoring Neotropical Migrants on their Winter Grounds (MoSI) and MAPS bird banding protocols. He is pursuing graduate studies in ornithology as an avenue towards conservation work. Bow is currently studying alpine bird populations in Washington State and preparing for Bornean bird ID by studying species characteristics, vocalizations, and assisting with acoustic tests. Bow’s passion for the Pacific Northwest mountain environments drives his interest in protecting wilderness.  What We NeedFunds raised through this campaign will assist in paying for:Airfare ($4,500)Travel costs ($1,500)Funds will be utilized regardless of whether the total fundraising goal is met.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Harvest Farms is a small scale organic farm in Bilpin, NSW dedicated to restorative agriculture. Our farm includes a thriving 2 acre market garden and now we are attempting to bring back to life a 700 tree apple orchard which was abandoned 8 years ago.</p>
<p>To As part of this restoration we will be using miniature goats to improve soil quality, control invasive weeds, and manage grass growth. We are restoring this orchard with a focus on producing pesticide-free apples for local consumers and preserving a living archive of apple varieties disappearing from our food culture.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530492328/bwyq5lnucgmajncgn5bf.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The method of orchard restoration we will be using allows control of many pests and weeds without chemical applications. Silvopasture is a method of grazing animals to control invasive weeds within wooded areas which can compete with desired plants for nutrients, sunlight, and water. Grazing animals the right way can also greatly improve soil quality without the use of chemical fertilizers or other unsustainable inputs. We intend to increase the value of our apples by growing them in in this manner. We will make the project financially sustainable by selling this amazing new variety of miniature dairy goats.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need Nigerian Dwarf Goats. This miniature dairy goat can be grazed in small spaces as well as provide additional value products such as milk and cheese. We need to purchase a high % Nigerian Dwarf pedigree buck in order to start breeding these goats reliably. Many hobby farmers would benefit from having a small backyard herd to provide fresh, healthy milk for their families and communities and these miniature goats require much less space than traditional dairy animals.</p>

<p>We have chosen Nigerian Dwarf Goats for multiple reasons in addition to the ones stated above. They have the richest goat milk of any breed (with a butterfat content of 6-10%) as well as produce more milk per kilo of feed consumed than large dairy goat breeds. This small animal can also graze under our dwarf root stock apple trees without damaging fruit production which is key to orchard restoration. </p>

</div><div><ul></ul></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The Nigerian Dwarf Goat breed has recently been introduced to Australia and, due to border bio-security control, costs of animals of this breed are still quite high. In choosing Nigerian Dwarf Goats we are hoping to help increase the pool of farmers working to develop the breed here in Australia.

You will be in on the grass roots level of introducing this fabulous dairy goat to more of Australia as our farm begins to thrive. </p>
<p>We also need to be aware and prepared for any health or safety risks to the animals; including predators, weather, and illnesses. We need to buy proper fencing, housing, feed/mineral supplements, etc. and make connections with a local veterinarian before we are ready to bring animals onto our farm. We have been researching our options and talking to local farmers and feel confident that we will be able to do this as soon as we have sufficient funding.  </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 02/28/2021: We officially released MEET BOB on January 26th, 2021 and books are now available.</strong></p>
<p><strong>-------------</strong></p>
<h3>Who is Bob?</h3>
<p>Through my first book ""MEET BOB"", I provide an exclusive look into the colourful life of Bob. Bob enjoys breakfasts of caviar, dips in his own saltwater pool, and biweekly foot massages on the beach. A charmed life, perhaps, but he deserves it: Bob spends much of his time interacting with school children on his home island Curaçao.  He is an emissary for conservation.</p>
<p>Bob, you see, is a flamingo.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1601292328/zxuhj1rlrgg0u5ftfpa7.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Veterinarian Odette Doest rescued Bob in 2016, </strong>after he had slammed into a hotel window. While rehabilitating the bird at her nonprofit wildlife sanctuary, Fundashon Dier en Onderwijs Cariben (Foundation for Animals and Education in the Caribbean), Odette discovered that not only did the flamingo have a concussion and an injured left wing, but, he had previously been domesticated.  Bob was too relaxed around people; he also suffered from bumblefoot, a chronic foot disease common in captive birds, which would impair his ability to catch food in the wild.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1601292396/tfiw9b0bcga47us68tpt.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Because of his injuries, Odette decided to keep Bob as an educational animal at her sanctuary. When she started taking him on her foundation’s weekly visits to schools and community gathering spots on the Dutch Caribbean isle, the flamingo became an instant celebrity.  Bob's fame now helps Odette tell a larger story:  the duo work together to make people more aware of environmental issues in the Caribbean.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why this book?</h3>
<p>For me, the story of Bob is very personal.  </p>
<p>MEET BOB is not ‘just a book.’   It’s a fundraising campaign for conservation, and you get the book for free. </p>
<p>My father was born on Curaçao, a relatively small island North of Venezuela.  He moved to The Netherlands when he was a little boy, where I was born and raised. It took me 27 years before I visited my father’s birthplace. I don’t know exactly why... ⠀</p>
<p> During my late teens I developed a close relationship with my cousin Odette.  She was studying at the Faculty of Veterinary Practices in Utrecht and I was interested in photography.  She would visit our home with stories and pictures of wildlife in the Peruvian jungle.  When I finally visited her during the summer of 2006, I remember noticing how much we have in common.  While she would visit us visit every year in NL, it took me another 10 years before I would visit her again. Again, I don't know why...</p>
<p>When I visited Curacao again in 2016,  Odette had just rescued a flamingo.  He couldn’t be released back to the wild; he was a relaxed, chill being, and we named him Bob.  On the second day of my visit, as the bedside clock was changing to 7:00 am, Bob’s head peaked through the door to my room — it was in the early hours of that morning, our photographic journey began.  Little did we both know how many lives would positively be affected by our actions.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1601803513/svco6ulpwaqgbnovcgf1.jpg"" src=""""/> </p>
<p>On the final day of my last visit, I joined Bob for a swim in the crystal clear waters surrounding the island. As I swam back to beach to call it a day and head to the airport, I looked back at the odd couple bobbing at sea. They live a remarkable life together, although, to them it’s just their daily life. To me, their story is an intimate love story about how two individuals, that depend on each other, initiate positive change by educating future generations. And, even though I’d rather see Bob return to the wild, it’s good to know that together with Odette he’s able to make a real difference. It's been a year now since I've visited them and I miss them dearly. This time, I do know why ❤️. </p>
<p>The story of Bob and Odette has been well received in the media through a large variety of international magazine publications.  Bob’s story was celebrated in the <a href=""http://www.worldpressphoto.org/collection/photo/2019/37705/1/Jasper-Doest-(1)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2019 World Press Photo contest</a>, Wildlife Photographer of the Year, Pictures of the Year International and the Sony World Photography Awards.

<p>People from all over the world have reached out to us on how much they appreciate Odette's work and how she is a role model for many. While all the acknowledgements have been heart warming, I have personally wanted to do something more for Odette, for Bob, and for wildlife conservation in the Caribbean.  As the island of Curaçao holds the roots to my heritage, MEET BOB is my tribute to my own history,  a celebration of the color in my life and my small contribution to the island's future. </p>

<h3>About the photographer</h3>
<p>Dutch photographer Jasper Doest creates visual stories that explore the relationship between humankind and nature. Having majored in ecology, Doest knows human life depends on everything our planet has to offer, yet he recognizes the unsustainable nature of the current human patterns of consumption. As a true believer in the power of photography to initiate change, Doest is an International League of Conservation Photographers senior fellow and a World Wildlife Fund ambassador. He is also a contributing photographer for National Geographic magazine and has received awards from World Press Photo and Wildlife Photographer of the Year.</p>
</div></div>","UPDATE 02/28/2021: We officially released MEET BOB on January 26th, 2021 and books are now available.
-------------
Who is Bob?
Through my first book ""MEET BOB"", I provide an exclusive look into the colourful life of Bob. Bob enjoys breakfasts of caviar, dips in his own saltwater pool, and biweekly foot massages on the beach. A charmed life, perhaps, but he deserves it: Bob spends much of his time interacting with school children on his home island Curaçao.  He is an emissary for conservation.
Bob, you see, is a flamingo.

 
Veterinarian Odette Doest rescued Bob in 2016, after he had slammed into a hotel window. While rehabilitating the bird at her nonprofit wildlife sanctuary, Fundashon Dier en Onderwijs Cariben (Foundation for Animals and Education in the Caribbean), Odette discovered that not only did the flamingo have a concussion and an injured left wing, but, he had previously been domesticated.  Bob was too relaxed around people; he also suffered from bumblefoot, a chronic foot disease common in captive birds, which would impair his ability to catch food in the wild.
 

Because of his injuries, Odette decided to keep Bob as an educational animal at her sanctuary. When she started taking him on her foundation’s weekly visits to schools and community gathering spots on the Dutch Caribbean isle, the flamingo became an instant celebrity.  Bob's fame now helps Odette tell a larger story:  the duo work together to make people more aware of environmental issues in the Caribbean.
 
Why this book?
For me, the story of Bob is very personal.  
MEET BOB is not ‘just a book.’   It’s a fundraising campaign for conservation, and you get the book for free. 
My father was born on Curaçao, a relatively small island North of Venezuela.  He moved to The Netherlands when he was a little boy, where I was born and raised. It took me 27 years before I visited my father’s birthplace. I don’t know exactly why... ⠀
 During my late teens I developed a close relationship with my cousin Odette.  She was studying at the Faculty of Veterinary Practices in Utrecht and I was interested in photography.  She would visit our home with stories and pictures of wildlife in the Peruvian jungle.  When I finally visited her during the summer of 2006, I remember noticing how much we have in common.  While she would visit us visit every year in NL, it took me another 10 years before I would visit her again. Again, I don't know why...
When I visited Curacao again in 2016,  Odette had just rescued a flamingo.  He couldn’t be released back to the wild; he was a relaxed, chill being, and we named him Bob.  On the second day of my visit, as the bedside clock was changing to 7:00 am, Bob’s head peaked through the door to my room — it was in the early hours of that morning, our photographic journey began.  Little did we both know how many lives would positively be affected by our actions.
 
On the final day of my last visit, I joined Bob for a swim in the crystal clear waters surrounding the island. As I swam back to beach to call it a day and head to the airport, I looked back at the odd couple bobbing at sea. They live a remarkable life together, although, to them it’s just their daily life. To me, their story is an intimate love story about how two individuals, that depend on each other, initiate positive change by educating future generations. And, even though I’d rather see Bob return to the wild, it’s good to know that together with Odette he’s able to make a real difference. It's been a year now since I've visited them and I miss them dearly. This time, I do know why ❤️. 
The story of Bob and Odette has been well received in the media through a large variety of international magazine publications.  Bob’s story was celebrated in the 2019 World Press Photo contest, Wildlife Photographer of the Year, Pictures of the Year International and the Sony World Photography Awards. In 2020, Bob proudly graced the pages of National Geographic Magazine.

While all the acknowledgements have been heart warming, I have personally wanted to do something more for Odette, for Bob, and for wildlife conservation in the Caribbean.  As the island of Curaçao holds the roots to my heritage, MEET BOB is my tribute to my own history,  a celebration of the color in my life and my small contribution to the island's future. 

Odette’s wildlife rescue work is completely self-funded through her income as a veterinarian. When an injured wild animal is brought into FDOC, Odette pays for all of their care out of her own pocket.  Therefore, I have decided that all revenues of this book will be donated to the conservation and education work of FDOC, so that we can all help support the important conservation work of FDOC.  
This book is an opportunity for me to help someone who tries to make this world a better place. This book celebrates Bob and Odette.

Never would I have thought about doing a story about a family member, but it's proves this power lives in all of us; compassion and empathy as the starting point of positive change. Something this world needs, more than ever.

We are dedicated to cultivating a regenerative, thriving and abundant world that is equitable and accessible for all. We have found recent success in our pre-tour summer events that we have organized in order to both get the word out and develop the necessary experience to launch a full three-month tour.<br/></span><br/><b>Innovate Solutions<br/>
</b></p>
<p>       Our tour is one aspect of the larger movement towards cultivating a thriving, just, sustainable, regenerative, and equitable world. Joanna Macy speaks about the three spheres of influence, which are holding actions (anything that slows down the industrial growth complex), solution focused actions (being the change we want to see), and inner transformation. All three spheres support one another and are necessary for creating positive change. Our tour combines all three spheres.</p>
<p>      The Blooming Biodiversity Permaculture Tour provides innovative experiences for both long-time permaculture activists and those who have never set foot in a garden. It creates an access point and a bridge to bring people together who may have varying interests. We will be working in each community to create lasting impact by empowering local community members to maintain the momentum that our events generate after we leave. We will be teaching participants how to organize their own similar events, so that the permaculture work and community building experiences can continue indefinitely. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p> Our tour will help benefit those in need of resilient lifestyles, those who do not have enough healthy food to eat, and those who are disconnected from their local communities.<br/></p>

<p>   We will be training all participants to create their own permaculture activations in their local communities, so the positive transformation can continue after we go. We project that our participants will be inspired to integrate permaculture principles, community connection, and regenerative practices into their lifestyles. We have already seen many participants modifying their life paths after attending our events. We have been seeing and will see permaculture projects that would normally take a month to finish, be completed within a day of work. Over a three-year period, we project to see community members creating their own permaculture events and permaculture tours. We project to see thriving urban and rural food forests and edible gardens, grey-water and water catchment systems that utilize all rainfall and excess water, and more connected communities, all along the North American West Coast and beyond. </p>

Our tour will include empowering days of action with interactive workshops for social and environmental evolution including: permaculture and biodynamic farming, gardening, live music, yoga, healing, expressive and visionary arts and ecstatic dance integrated into communities and Ecovillages.What Are We Doing?In every location, we will be gathering communities for the integration of permaculture principles and values, holistic education and transformational festival culture, in action. We are inviting anyone who feels enthusiastically empowered to bring their skill-sets and passion to the co-creation of this tour. Through these activating permaculture experiences, participants will experience the beauty of living in harmony with nature and supporting each other in community.To make this all happen, we will need your help from the grassroots up! 
The Purpose: 
To help shift the paradigm from a corporate ruled industrial complex to an intentional, community-created, thriving co-existence.
To nurture the blooming of regenerative biodiversity everywhere we go.
To envision and strategize ways to transcend existing patterns o f global inequality.
To empower community to restore the commons and a culturally rich lifestyle.
To generate a self-sustaining livelihood with community initiated food gardens and organic innovative design.

Our Principles:

Our core principles are earth care, people care, and fair share. We are dedicated to cultivating a regenerative, thriving and abundant world that is equitable and accessible for all. We have found recent success in our pre-tour summer events that we have organized in order to both get the word out and develop the necessary experience to launch a full three-month tour.Innovate Solutions

       Our tour is one aspect of the larger movement towards cultivating a thriving, just, sustainable, regenerative, and equitable world. Joanna Macy speaks about the three spheres of influence, which are holding actions (anything that slows down the industrial growth complex), solution focused actions (being the change we want to see), and inner transformation. All three spheres support one another and are necessary for creating positive change. Our tour combines all three spheres.
      The Blooming Biodiversity Permaculture Tour provides innovative experiences for both long-time permaculture activists and those who have never set foot in a garden. It creates an access point and a bridge to bring people together who may have varying interests. We will be working in each community to create lasting impact by empowering local community members to maintain the momentum that our events generate after we leave. We will be teaching participants how to organize their own similar events, so that the permaculture work and community building experiences can continue indefinitely. 


 Our tour will help benefit those in need of resilient lifestyles, those who do not have enough healthy food to eat, and those who are disconnected from their local communities.



Positive Impact
   We will be training all participants to create their own permaculture activations in their local communities, so the positive transformation can continue after we go. We project that our participants will be inspired to integrate permaculture principles, community connection, and regenerative practices into their lifestyles. We have already seen many participants modifying their life paths after attending our events. We have been seeing and will see permaculture projects that would normally take a month to finish, be completed within a day of work. Over a three-year period, we project to see community members creating their own permaculture events and permaculture tours. We project to see thriving urban and rural food forests and edible gardens, grey-water and water catchment systems that utilize all rainfall and excess water, and more connected communities, all along the North American West Coast and beyond. 

Projected Costs



Food Costs: $9,000Healthy nutritious food is necessary for taking positive transformative action. 
Shovels and Hand Tools $333 and Work Gloves $65These are the bare necessities of effective permaculture work. Every permaculture activist need these essentials. We want to be ready to provide for both our team and local participants. 

Starter Trees for Food Forests $1,000, Starter Plants for Edible Gardens $400, and Organic Seed Packs, $250   To plant edible gardens and food forests, we need starter plants and seeds. We plan to plant many pollinator habitats to encourage bees, hummingbirds, and other pollinators to sweep the West Coast in greater abundance. We plan to plant many edible gardens and food forests to make organic local food more accessible to communities.
Tubes for Greywater Systems  $525One of the greatest issues facing the West Coast today is our lack of water. By utilizing our excess water to feed our plants, we are taking a huge step in a regenerative direction. 
Clay and Straw for Natural Building Projects (Cob Benches, Cob Ovens, Cob and Straw Bale Outdoor Classrooms) $1,000Natural building is a fun and powerful method of getting in touch with the earth while building long lasting sustainable infrastructure that can be used for many purposes. Building an outdoor educational classroom out of cob will engage local students, create memorable experiences, and plant a setting for outdoor education classes. Cob benches in neighborhoods will create environments for neighbors and passersby to sit and connect with one another, enjoy time in a community garden, and build community. 
Bags of Mulch  $560Every garden needs to be mulched. Mulching is a fun and engaging activity that helps utilize water optimally, keeps out weeds, and adds beauty to the garden. 

Total: $11,111



We can only realize this dream with the support of our community. To tour in an eco-friendly manner, create regenerative infrastructure, and assist the creation of resilient communities everywhere we go, requires financial support through your donations to our indieGogo campaign.
We are so grateful for your contributions to help us actualize this tour and for taking action with us to create a reality where we can all thrive.

<p>Why should you help us Save The Saba Ecolodge? Are you passionate about the environment and want to share this passion with others, for generations to come?

Well, let us show you. <br/></p><p>Saba, a tiny Caribbean island just 28 miles
south of St. Maarten, offers a unique experience to any and all
travelers.  Saba, known as The Unspoiled Queen, is proud of its
nature and preservation efforts.  </p>
<p>In 2002, the construction of the Ecolodge was
complete, and for over a decade it was successfully run by our friend Bernt.
Tourists and locals alike enjoyed the off-grid living and serene beauty that
the Ecolodge has to offer. Recently, Bernt passed away, and The Ecolodge has
been in decline. In the last conversation I had with Bernt, he said “I wish
someone would take over the Ecolodge and realize its full potential.” <br/></p><p>We vow to turn The Saba Ecolodge into a holistic, off-grid retreat, where locals, tourists
and volunteers can share their knowledge and experience. Our view for The Ecolodge allows us to offer classes in yoga,
meditation, cooking, foraging adventures, gardening, host youth environmental
programs and youth retreat programs, and much more. <br/></p>
<p>""We"", Keith and Kelly, have been good
friends for over 14 years. We have always had common interests and together
share a vision for The Saba Ecolodge. Given our wide range of experience and
skills, we really are the perfect fit for the Saba Ecolodge. </p>
<p>A few months ago, The Saba Ecolodge was a
disaster. It was heartbreaking to see the cabins so run down. The jungle had
taken over and the restaurant was non-functional. We're working day-in and day-out, and are having much success. We're repairing cabins, landscaping, gardening, composting, building stone walls and steps. The restaurant is open and we're composing dishes, developing cocktails, having yoga classes, bonfires, barbeques, jam sessions, and have hosted 2
parties of more than 100 people. Most importantly, we're making some great friends along the
way. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg for us.</p>
<p>We’ve got a lot of work ahead and many
challenges to overcome. But, right now, the only thing in our way is the possibility
of foreclosure. The bank hasn't been paid in quite some time, and they’re ready to drop
the gauntlet. We've submitted a business plan, and have been given 1 month to
make it happen. That’s why we’re asking for $150,000, to keep the Ecolodge from
going into foreclosure.               </p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The island of Saba needs The

In 2013, Keurig produced <b>8.3 billion more</b> - enough to circle the world <b>ten and a half times</b>. These K-Cups aren't recyclable in most areas, so they get thrown away - ending up in landfills or floating in our oceans. Until a recyclable option becomes available, we need to find away to brew our coffee responsibly.<div><br/></div><div>
<h4>STARTING SMALL.</h4>
<p>We can start by making a change on our campus. In many dorms, the only type of coffee machines allowed are single-serve. The only other way for students to get our coffee is to use a full meal swipe or pay $4.00 at Starbucks. Single-serve machines like the Keurig are the most affordable and easy way to make coffee, tea, or hot chocolate. At UNC there are currently around 18,000 undergrads. If 1 in 5 of those students has a Keurig and uses it just once a day, that's <b>809, 400 K-Cups</b> that we're putting into landfills each year. If 2 in 5 has a Keurig and uses it once a day, that's <b>over 1.6 million</b>. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4>HOW WE CAN HELP.</h4>
<p>The mission of this organization and website is to find a way to continue to use our Keurigs without such taking such a heavy toll on the environment. We want to start by collecting and recycling K-cups used on dorms in campus and sending them back to Keurig to use as fuel for it's facilities. Keurig sponsors a program called Grounds to Grow On that offers collection boxes and pick-up service for discarded K-Cups. Unfortunately, these collection boxes cost $100 each. Our goal is to install a collection box on every floor of the freshman residence halls on campus by the end of the Fall 2015 semester, and we need your help!</p>

Contribute to the campaign before it ends and be a part of The Campaign for Awesome - It's feels really good!</p><p><b><i>So what is The Machine of Awesome
Bright Liquid Blueness?</i></b></p>
<p>Over 10,000 LEDs bright is what it
is. It's an interactive sculpture, but more than that, it's a tool for
connectedness. It offers the opportunity for individual as well as communal
engagement, and dialogue on awesome bright liquid blueness.</p>
<p>The Machine of Awesome Bright Liquid
Blueness wants you to solve it, and you will be rewarded for seeing what needs
to be done. It wants you to touch it in special places, to embrace it. But what
it needs right now is your support. Join the campaign to build The Machine of
Awesome, and be eternally showered in bright liquid blueness.</p>
<p><b><i>Now, give me the details.</i></b></p>
<p>The Machine of Awesome (for short)
will be mounted on the wall and measures 96cm tall by 80cm wide and 30cm deep.
The front, sides, top, and bottom, are completely covered with tight strips of
LED lights. Also on the front, running along the right side is a ‘control
panel’. Now, as you can imagine, the front of the piece, with its tight strips
of LED lights creates what could be called a super low-resolution pixelated
screen. (or at least that is what I’m calling it)  The screen, when not
activated by the audience, will be swirling and pulsing to its own personal
beat. But upon approach, the audience will become a part of that beat. (you
won't be able to help yourself)</p>
<p>Flashing randomly, and being
difficult to read depending on proximity, will be simple but exciting
messages. “The Most Amazing!” “Revitalizing!” “Refresh &amp; Survive!” “Live!”
– (hopefully you get the idea here.) Also “$2 Play!” “Winner EveryTime!”</p>
<p>Upon closer viewing the ‘control
panel’ will feature instructions. Those instructions, printed like you would
have seen on an old pinball machine, will read as such:</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS</p>
<p>1)  Insert Toonie.</p>
<p>2)  Touch me in the right
places.</p>
<p>3)  Winner EveryTime!</p>
<p>Pretty straightforward right?</p>
<p><b><i></i></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1262398/files/20150302122235-Bottle_Label_Final4.jpg?1425327755"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><b><i>So what happens when you insert a
Toonie?</i></b></p>
<p>First off, the machine goes wild with
bright crazy excitement saying Thank You! Once it composes itself, mounted near
the top of the control panel is an hour glass with five minutes worth of sand
in it, and it rotates. BEGIN!</p>
<p>The LED’s flash and a new super
low-resolution pixelated image covers the front with what looks to be an old
Space Invaders game. The shapes are a little different, but they are moving
toward you and you better do something about it. You touch the ship on the
bottom of the screen and it shoots a yellow laser beam. Miss! They are getting
closer, moving faster. You fire again, this time….</p>
<p>Suddenly a fish swims up from the
bottom of the screen. Moving through the water, it settles down near the bottom
of the screen. Fighting against the current, the fish encounters debris
floating down the stream. The fish needs your help - dodging and weaving you do
your best to keep the fish safe.</p>
<p>The screen flashes and dissolves into
an image of a beautiful tree. There it is, in all its glory. Leaves gently
swaying in the wind. But what’s next? What do you do with this tree? Text
begins to flash up around the tree, but you are standing to close to read the
super low-resolution pixelated words. Turning you look to those around you for
help. What does it say? It says….</p>
<p>The Machine of Awesome Bright Liquid
Blueness explodes with colour! “WINNER!” flashing on the screen. Pulsing and
dancing you can hear the hum of small electronic motors. A prize drops from the
control panel. Pulling the prize from the holder, you see  further instructions. Now it’s your turn.</p>
<p><b><i>The Team.</i></b></p>
<p>Only through community will The
Machine of Awesome Bright Liquid Blueness get built, shared, and enjoyed.</p>

<p>ManoRun is hosting The Machine of
Awesome Bright Liquid Blueness kick off party Friday March 13th. Come and
experience ManoRun's exploration of indigenous plants and diet. The evening
will be a taste experience of local grown heirloom corn, home made mole's and
tortillas. For the last 3 years the farm has been developing it's ability to
grow food that would have been grown here before European's arrived and also
incorporating that food into our diet. Denise, Chris and Kaleb recently visited
Oaxaca, Mexico which is known as the agricultural cradle of the America's
having had a profound impact on plant diversity within these hemispheres. For
those that can come early  - you can help make tortillas, and for
those that come later you can enjoy these wonders of the gastronomic world.</p>

</div></div>","Thank you everyone that came out last night! We had just over 25 people come through the studio last night and ran the demo twice for the different crowds. Raised an addition $560! so thank you to those that contributed to the campaign. These funds will go directly to paying for the LEDs.There's still time left for those that want to get in on the campaign. Check the perks and make your selection, this is one of the few times they will be available.If you want to come by the studio for a demo, just contact me to make the arrangements. Thanks, Christopher & Tim.The final event is this Saturday 11th at the studio!We will have on display for the event just over 3000 LED's with some artwork samples build in. Hope you can make it - anytime after 7:30 or call me if you want to come at a different time. 905-730-4008. Only 7 days left! While we realize we will not meet the goal, we are very happy that a good portion of the LED purchase will be covered by everyone supporting the project, so thank you all. Tim has completed the hand wired power supplies (x4) that are required for the display Saturday. Check the gallery for images. The LED's are mounted on salvaged and refinished 2x8's that stretch out just over 16' along the studio wall. We may not need house lights for this event! I'm really looking forward to some community feedback on the set up and the artwork, so come on by or email/call to set up another time. Contribute to the campaign before it ends and be a part of The Campaign for Awesome - It's feels really good!So what is The Machine of Awesome
Bright Liquid Blueness?
Over 10,000 LEDs bright is what it
is. It's an interactive sculpture, but more than that, it's a tool for
connectedness. It offers the opportunity for individual as well as communal
engagement, and dialogue on awesome bright liquid blueness.
The Machine of Awesome Bright Liquid
Blueness wants you to solve it, and you will be rewarded for seeing what needs
to be done. It wants you to touch it in special places, to embrace it. But what
it needs right now is your support. Join the campaign to build The Machine of
Awesome, and be eternally showered in bright liquid blueness.
Now, give me the details.
The Machine of Awesome (for short)
will be mounted on the wall and measures 96cm tall by 80cm wide and 30cm deep.
The front, sides, top, and bottom, are completely covered with tight strips of
LED lights. Also on the front, running along the right side is a ‘control
panel’. Now, as you can imagine, the front of the piece, with its tight strips
of LED lights creates what could be called a super low-resolution pixelated
screen. (or at least that is what I’m calling it)  The screen, when not
activated by the audience, will be swirling and pulsing to its own personal
beat. But upon approach, the audience will become a part of that beat. (you
won't be able to help yourself)
Flashing randomly, and being
difficult to read depending on proximity, will be simple but exciting
messages. “The Most Amazing!” “Revitalizing!” “Refresh & Survive!” “Live!”
– (hopefully you get the idea here.) Also “$2 Play!” “Winner EveryTime!”
Upon closer viewing the ‘control
panel’ will feature instructions. Those instructions, printed like you would
have seen on an old pinball machine, will read as such:
INSTRUCTIONS
1)  Insert Toonie.
2)  Touch me in the right
places.
3)  Winner EveryTime!
Pretty straightforward right?
So what happens when you insert a
Toonie?
First off, the machine goes wild with
bright crazy excitement saying Thank You! Once it composes itself, mounted near
the top of the control panel is an hour glass with five minutes worth of sand
in it, and it rotates. BEGIN!
The LED’s flash and a new super
low-resolution pixelated image covers the front with what looks to be an old
Space Invaders game. The shapes are a little different, but they are moving
toward you and you better do something about it. You touch the ship on the
bottom of the screen and it shoots a yellow laser beam. Miss! They are getting
closer, moving faster. You fire again, this time….
Suddenly a fish swims up from the
bottom of the screen. Moving through the water, it settles down near the bottom
of the screen. Fighting against the current, the fish encounters debris
floating down the stream. The fish needs your help - dodging and weaving you do
your best to keep the fish safe.
The screen flashes and dissolves into
an image of a beautiful tree. There it is, in all its glory. Leaves gently
swaying in the wind. But what’s next? What do you do with this tree? Text
begins to flash up around the tree, but you are standing to close to read the
super low-resolution pixelated words. Turning you look to those around you for
help. What does it say? It says….
The Machine of Awesome Bright Liquid
Blueness explodes with colour! “WINNER!” flashing on the screen. Pulsing and
dancing you can hear the hum of small electronic motors. A prize drops from the
control panel. Pulling the prize from the holder, you see  further instructions. Now it’s your turn.
The Team.
Only through community will The
Machine of Awesome Bright Liquid Blueness get built, shared, and enjoyed.

<p>When the parents of 700 children discovered that a
large-scale vineyard was planned for a site just feet away from the five

<p>Reaching out to the vineyard developer was the first

approach to vineyard management even when faced with evidence that pesticide
use near schools is extremely dangerous to children. (See Pesticide Action

<p>When the good neighbor approach failed, WCA
took action politically with the County Supervisors and the Agricultural

was time to take steps to make a change in the status quo and bring real

<p>Do we want RoundUp, a known carcinogen, along with sulphur and other pesticides sprayed near

The Impact

Ecology can not be well understood if we insist on the study of it, as an
independent science without considering Social Factors. The best road for
conservation is through Promotion, Teaching, and active Participation of

Riesgos y desafíos
La fotografía
juega un crítico, aunque rara vez reconocido papel en la conservación ilustrando
la belleza del mundo natural y las formas en las cuales está siendo dañado y
destruido. Aún es posible tocar el corazón de la gente y cambiar la manera en
que pensamos y actuamos. La fotografía
es una herramienta que lo hace de una forma en que muchas veces las palabras no
pueden.Risks
and Challenges
Photography plays a critical but seldom acknowledged role in
the conservation of wildlife, illustrating the beauty and wonders of nature, and the many ways that it is being harmed and destroyed. It is still possible to touch the heart
and ways of the people, helping them change their thoughts and actions towards
nature.

Our birth right means nothing if a few people can get richer by destroying it.Our goal is simple:  Protect it.Our immediate challenge is establishing a ""base of operations"" where communities can gather and meet, organise, and reverse some of the damage that has already been done.For £10,000, we can buy a relatively small piece of land, and create a modest wildlife sanctuary, giving plants and animals facing habitat loss somewhere to survive.We ideally want to reach a humble target of at least £50,000 pounds.  This, and a bit of direct action, would allow us to create an off grid, environmentally sound neolithic community.  Not only would be able to defend the land we owned, restore and protect the wildlife, but we could also live on it.At £150,000 we can create a community, no direct action required, while also extending the amount of land we own.  The logic is very simple - the more we own, the more we can defend.  If our government won't say no to fracking, and potash mining, we can.  We want to take £1,000,000.  This would give us enough acres to be a serious, influential force to shape the face of Yorkshire for generations.  Yes, that's not going to happen, but we can dream, right?If you don't understand my accent in the video, a transcript is available.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Self-sustainable Farm in Nepal</h2>
<h3>1.  Who are we ?</h3>
<p>We are a Swiss-Nepali family of three.</p>
<p>A.     Caspar Eigelsreiter<br/>He was born 29th of August 1990 in Switzerland. He speaks fluently French, German and Nepali. After finishing College, he went to do his duty in the Swiss Army during thirteen months, in which period he became a first lieutenant. The year after (2013), he went to Nepal for five months to experience Nepali culture and life and to learn Nepali, and it is during that stay that he met his future wife Jyoti Rana Magar. He went back to Switzerland for ten months to work and the next year (2014) he got married with Jyoti on the 5th of September. Since then he lives in Nepal and tries to build a self-sustainable farm.</p>
<p>B.     Jyoti and Sharaï Rana Magar<br/>Jyoti was born on 30th of November 1993 in Carghare in Solukhumbu District (near Mt Everest) in Nepal. She worked for her grandfather and grandmother since her youngest age, be in the fields or helping out with the different animals of the household. She only went to school for three years, but learned to write and read in English and Nepali in those few years. Departing from her home district, she went to Nuwakot District to work for a Sherpa family in a farm for five years. It is where she met Caspar.<br/>Sharaï was born on 1st of January 2016, seven months after the 2015 earthquake, which hit her parents house as well.</p>
<h3>2.  Why do we campaign ?</h3>
<p>A.     We are building a self-sustainable farm, to have the least possible negative impact on the environment.</p>
<p>B.     We hope to provide high quality goods, like vegetables, cheese, milk and meat to the local community.</p>
<p>C.     We try to improve our farming process, without machines and without any industrial chemicals to go back to a simpler agriculture, but with the modern understanding of farming, like permaculture.</p>
<h3>3.  What would you achieve by helping us ?</h3>
<p>A.     Improvement in the disposition of the terraces. Our land is steep and can only be cultivated after building terraces, which are prone to earth slides during the rainy season (June to September). To improve size and stability, the need for stronger, bigger walls arises, which would provide perfect growing places for rampant plants, like cucumber or pumpkin.</p>
<p>B.     Energy would be provided mainly by multiple solar panels for the electric needs of house and farm.</p>
<p>C.     Building a Biogas facility would provide all the gas needed for cooking and if need be to light the house.</p>
<p>D.     To make cheese, the need of a cellar arises.</p>
<p>E.     With the heavy rains of the monsoon and the colder days of winter, multiple greenhouse would enable us to grow all around the year, be it tomatoes or chilly pepper, or even green beans.</p>
<p>F.     Lastly, crops need a storage place, that is dry, but dark. We would build a warehouse for our different crops; potatoes, wheat, corn, sweet potatoes, soybeans, etc…</p>
<h3>4.  Where do the funds go ?</h3>
<p>A.     Terraces, cellar and biogas facility: 3000 USD</p>
<p>B.     Greenhouses: 500 USD</p>
<p>C.     Solar Panels: 3000 USD</p>
<p>D.     Warehouse: 3000 USD<br/><br/>Those numbers are an approximation and can vary a lot.</p>
<h3>5.  Our perks ?</h3>
<p>A.     We would be happy to have you as guests in our home, if you ever visit Nepal (max. 2 pers.)</p>
<p>B.     We can send you T-shirts or cups with your name on our farm’s photos background.</p>
<h3>6.  What kind of impact do we have ?</h3>
<p>A.     We lower our impact on the environment by seeking alternative energies.</p>
<p>B.     We provide organic healthy foods.</p>
<p>C.     We escape the capitalist and consumerist system to advertise an ideal based on collaboration and not money.</p>
<p>D.     We want to be an example for farmers of our region. We would give them hope, by constructing an economically viable self-sustainable farm.</p>
<h3>7.  What are the risks you take and the challenges we face ?</h3>
<p>A.     Problem: Even if the funds are ready, it can take a lot of time to start building, because we have a lot of daily work that has to be done before we can think of doing something else.</p>
<p>Solution: Building the different aspects of the project one by one, step by step, without starting it all at once.</p>
<p>B.     Problem: As our fields are used for crops during most of the time, we can only build between harvest and planting.</p>
<p>Solution: Thinking ahead during planting, by freeing the terraces that need to be modified.</p>
<p>C.     Problem: During monsoon, the project would be mainly at a still stand because of the amount of rain falling.</p>
<p>Solution: We will use the months without rain to do as much as possible.</p>
<p>D.     Problem: We do not have an access road to our house.</p>
<p>Solution: Carry the goods ourselves, or pay a local worker to get it done.</p>
<p>F.     Problem: We lack the knowledge to build efficient greenhouses and the biogas facility.</p>
<p>Solution: Seek out, in both instances, associations with the required knowledge before even thinking about starting to build.</p>

<h3> BACKGROUND</h3>
<p>Lions probably speak more directly to people than any other wild species. Through art, through literature, through symbolism and heraldry, through representations on flags and national emblems, lions have a universality that appeals regardless of culture, race, and national origin. Lions represent such a strong image to the world that words cannot but fail to express the true level of their iconic impact.</p>
<p>Lions represent hope and future, courage and strength, royalty and power. But they are also so very fragile and needing of our protection. We have all failed in the past to protect lions and to do what we innovatively could have done years ago. Lions are now an endangered species, and we have watched the decline from the sidelines for far too long.</p>
<p>It is now up to us to have the courage, fortitude, and strength to protect and conserve a species globally representative of the freedom and importance of wild animals. It can be done, but not without your dedicated support.</p>
<p>LionAid, together with an Ethiopian NGO (Alchemy World Projects) has the opportunity to engage with the Ethiopian Wildlife Conservation Authority and Provincial Authorities to lay the groundwork for a comprehensive lion conservation programme.</p>
<h3>HEADING THE<strong> LIONAID TEAM</strong>
</h3>
<p> LionAid, a charity dedicated to lions and new visions for their conservation in the future, is spearheaded by Dr Pieter Kat and Christine Macsween:</p>
<p><strong><a href=""http://lionaid.org/executives.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dr Pieter Kat</a> </strong>is an internationally acknowledged expert on lions and is regularly consulted by African governments on lion conservation issues. Pieter was born in Singapore (the Lion City) and spent his early life in Singapore, Malaysia and New Guinea where his interest in biology took root. His tertiary education took place in the USA where he gained a BSc at the University of Rochester (Biology and Geology), an MSc in Marine Biology at the University of Delaware and an MA and PhD in Ecology and Evolution at Johns Hopkins University.</p>
<p>Next he spent ten years working at the National Museums of Kenya to develop and enhance biological research programmes, including studies of biodiversity in the African Great Lakes, genetic diversity among bovid species (eg antelopes) of East Africa, genetics and ecology of predators of the Masai Mara and other areas (African Wild Dogs, Lions, African Wild Cats, Servals and Jackals), and diseases likely to affect predators across Kenya.</p>
<p>This was followed by two years at the University of California, Davis School of Veterinary Medicine and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, USA researching rabies virus genetics, African horse sickness, canine distemper, Rift Valley Fever and bluetongue virus amongst carnivores.</p>
<p>Pieter was then invited by the Government of Botswana to study lion populations and to make recommendations for their conservation, and established the Okavango Lion Conservation Programme in northern Botswana. The lion research focused on ecology, reproduction, disease prevalence and human/wildlife conflict. After twelve years in Botswana, he is now focused on a diversity of activities through the charity LionAid to assist the conservation of lions such as working with decision makers in the UK, EU and African lion range states to ensure better protection of remaining lions, seeking sustainable means of reducing lion/livestock conflict, encouraging further research on diseases threatening lions and calling for lion population surveys.</p>
<p>Pieter continues to play an important role in scientific research and has authored more than 70 scientific papers to date. He regularly works with media (Radio, television and newspapers) sharing his deep knowledge of Lions.</p>
<p><a href=""http://lionaid.org/executives.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Christine Macsween</strong></a>  is an integral and highly respected figure within lion conservation, whose diligent lobbying has resulted in ongoing, proactive, political, discussions addressing the plight of the species.</p>
<p>Her passion and wealth of knowledge regarding the Lion, is evident through her many media interviews, both nationally and internationally, making her a highly sought after contributor to the cause.</p>
<p>Chris obtained her BA in Manchester in 1979. In 1998 she was admitted as a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered Management Accountants (CIMA). She served on the CIMA Council between 2002 and 2006. She is also a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts.  For the last ten years, Chris has been applauded as an engaging and educated public speaker, who has held court in large conservation events in the United Kingdom, the EU and beyond.</p>
<p>Chris also works with Dr Kat delivering higher education presentations and lectures. In addition to this, LionAid run regular skype lessons bringing lions into classrooms across the globe.</p>
<h3>HEADING THE ALCHEMY WORLD TEAM</h3>
<p><strong>Carlo Tortora Brayda </strong>launched Alchemy World in 2006, a humanitarian aid agency based in East Africa focusing on delivering poverty alleviation and economic growth through private sector development and entrepreneurship. During this time he was Trade and Industry Advisor to the Ethiopian Government and its President. He also took assignments for the United Nations International Labour Organization, and the United Nations International Childrens Fund (UNICEF). He remains Non Executive Chairman of Alchemy World, and heavily engaged in Corporate Social Responsibility.</p>

He is a Director of Alchemy World Projects and a Brand Ambassador for this campaign.</p>
<h3>WHY DO ETHIOPIAN LIONS MATTER SO MUCH?</h3>

<p>Both teams are increasingly concerned that lions are silently sliding into extinction pan Africa and feel strongly that the next country to lose its wild lion population could well be Ethiopia – whose lions are genetically unique but not yet internationally recognised as a fourth sub species of lion (a scientific paper written in 2011 and published in 2013 detailing the genetics of these lions <a href=""http://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s10344-012-0668-5?shared_access_token=JjntszDVs8haYoozK-Fxofe4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY4R7geHye_U4hhl0J3iX__oMeI1fBlU7MQB7UkdtJyh6JYYu_LXlOo2xVqlr_UptotlEgOf-QaN7KgB5TWgNGBsTFRv_lWed1ztlWWFcED8gXJ97ORPGaPneAmZaBLzFRQ="" rel=""noopener nofollow"">can be accessed here</a>), and with tremendous cultural and historical value in Ethiopia. Such a loss, and maybe only five years away would be nationally and internationally mourned and we must do everything we can to prevent this catastrophe from becoming a reality.</p>
<h3>THE PROJECT IN DETAIL</h3>
<p>It is clear that an URGENT programme is needed to assess the numbers of surviving populations of lions in Ethiopia, to stabilise their populations and secure their habitats and to eventually allow future population increases.</p>
<p>LionAid, together with Alchemy World Projects has the opportunity to engage with the Ethiopian Wildlife Conservation Authority and Provincial Authorities to lay the groundwork for a comprehensive lion conservation programme.</p>
<p>The funding we have called for in this campaign will allow us to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify and support an Ethiopian PhD student who will eventually assume local supervision and implementation of the project.</li>
<li>Conduct a full lion count in accessible regions of Ethiopia with reliable and replicable methods, concentrating initially on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awash_National_Park"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Awash National Park.</a>
</li>
<li>Place telemetry collars on selected lions to allow monitoring.</li>
<li>Establish continuous monitoring of lion trends, habitat quality, other carnivores and prey base throughout the lion range.</li>
<li>Research on lion ecology and relationship with local communities.</li>
<li>Create a database on human-lion conflict in the study area.</li>
<li>Research illegal trade in lion and lion products.</li>
<li>Establish a genetic and disease database for Ethiopian lions to identify populations of special concern and conservation priority – including establishing a central dedicated cryopreservation facility to allow long term storage of a diversity of wildlife samples.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Each of these goals could be achieved in isolation if we don’t raise the funding we need and in which case we will prioritise the goals in line with the monies donated to support the project. But obviously, the more money we can raise, the quicker we can achieve all the above and move the project to the next stage - to establish, with the full support of the Ethiopian Wildlife Conservation Authority, a comprehensive lion conservation programme.</p>
<h3>RISKS</h3>
<p>Ethiopia borders a number of unstable countries to the south (Somalia), to the west (South Sudan) and to the north (Eritrea). While there are reportedly lion populations along those border areas, this project will focus initially on lion populations with a high probability of immediate survival - those located in the centre of Ethiopia - Awash National Park. Another potentially problematic situation is the current structure of wildlife conservation authorities which is split between the federal government and the various autonomous provinces. However these different authorities have in the past worked well together to ensure survival of Ethiopia's endangered wildlife regardless of location of that wildlife. There is a huge willingness on the part of the federal Government to ensure that Ethiopia's national wildlife heritage is safeguarded for future generations - the Ethiopian people have a strong cultural connection to lions. </p>

THE PROJECT IN DETAIL
It is clear that an URGENT programme is needed to assess the numbers of surviving populations of lions in Ethiopia, to stabilise their populations and secure their habitats and to eventually allow future population increases.
LionAid, together with Alchemy World Projects has the opportunity to engage with the Ethiopian Wildlife Conservation Authority and Provincial Authorities to lay the groundwork for a comprehensive lion conservation programme.
The funding we have called for in this campaign will allow us to do the following:

Identify and support an Ethiopian PhD student who will eventually assume local supervision and implementation of the project.
Conduct a full lion count in accessible regions of Ethiopia with reliable and replicable methods, concentrating initially on Awash National Park.

Place telemetry collars on selected lions to allow monitoring.
Establish continuous monitoring of lion trends, habitat quality, other carnivores and prey base throughout the lion range.
Research on lion ecology and relationship with local communities.
Create a database on human-lion conflict in the study area.
Research illegal trade in lion and lion products.
Establish a genetic and disease database for Ethiopian lions to identify populations of special concern and conservation priority – including establishing a central dedicated cryopreservation facility to allow long term storage of a diversity of wildlife samples.

 
Each of these goals could be achieved in isolation if we don’t raise the funding we need and in which case we will prioritise the goals in line with the monies donated to support the project.

<p><b>Greenroute Trabajemos juntos por un
mundo mejor</b></p>
<p><b>Historia</b>:</p>
<p>Somos un grupo de
personas que comparten los mismos ideales. Nos encanta reciclar, proteger el
medio ambiente, disfrutar de un atardecer 
y contribuir a nuestra sociedad.</p>
<p>Mi nombre es Marcelo
y soy el creador del Proyecto GreenRoute. Este proyecto tiene su origen hace
varios años cuando trabajaba para el Gobierno de Chile como encargado del área
de tecnologías de la información.</p>
<p>Un fin de semana el
servidor principal dejó de funcionar. Tratamos de arreglarlo, pero por
desgracia no fue posible. Mis colegas y yo tuvimos que improvisar y nos dirigimos
al cementerio de computadores (computadores 
desechados por otros departamentos) y construimos otro servidor.</p>
<p>Fue fantástico, este
viejo servidor funcionó  durante 3
semanas.</p>
<p>Como la experiencia
había sido exitosa, volvimos al cementerio y restauramos seis computadoras más.
Estábamos reciclando, reutilizando y reduciendo.</p>
<p>Desafortunadamente  no todos los componentes de un dispositivo
electrónico pueden ser reutilizados y es aquí es donde comienza el problema.</p>
<p>La cantidad de
basura electrónica mundial alcanzó 41,8 millones de toneladas en 2014, según un
nuevo informe de la Universidad de las Naciones Unidas. Chile, mi país, ocupa
el primer lugar en América Latina como generador de residuos electrónicos.</p>
<p>Entonces me hice dos
preguntas</p>
<p><b>¿Qué puedo hacer?</b></p>
<p>Y mi respuesta fue
impedir que los  residuos electrónicos
lleguen al  medio ambiente.</p>
<p><b>¿Cómo puedo hacerlo?</b></p>
<p>A través de una
planta de reciclaje electrónico.</p>
<p>Un día, en
una conversación informal con mis amigos, nos dimos cuenta de que  todos teníamos las mismas prácticas. Reciclar
en casa, utilizar cargadores solares y compartir nuestros automóviles.</p>
<p>El reciclaje
y cuidado por el medio ambiente era parte de nuestras vidas. Ese mismo día
Gonzalo y María e Ivette  aceptaron ser parte
del equipo. Ellos tendrían la misión de definir la estructura  y estrategia del proyecto.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Efectos de la basura electrónica</b></p>
<p>En el medio Ambiente:</p>
<p><span>·El plástico de
computadores podría tardar hasta mil años en degradarse</span></p>
<p>·Una pila de
mercurio es capaz de contaminar 600 mil litros de agua</p>
<p>·El Litio, Cadmio
y Níquel presente en algunos residuos electrónicos producen daños irreversibles
en los seres vivos pudiendo causar incluso la muerte.</p>

     irreversible damage to living beings, even death.



On Human Health







The main feature of our project will be the
integration.
We want to create communities committed to keep
up the environment and be a bridge between producers of electronic devices and consumers.








Through education, we will connect people with
the care of the environment.
Recycling points distributed in public and
private places, recycling fairs and strategic alliances with companies will be
the mechanisms to recover electronic waste.
During
the first year, our goal is:

To recycle at
     least 8 tons of electronic waste
To become a B
     Corp. 
To plan a
     “recycling day” in 7 schools

And create a large community of recyclers...
If we get the necessary funds,
we can build a small electronic recycling plant, buying tools, recruiting
people and developing this noble activity.













For
every reward, we will give a donation to The WATERisLIFE Project. A Straw
filter for school children and medical clinics.



For every reward, we will plant a tree in the forests
of Patagonia.






For every reward, we will give a donation to WWF
Gorilla conservation programs.







For each reward, we will give an environmental educational
talk at a school.

Greenroute Trabajemos juntos por un
mundo mejor
Historia:
Somos un grupo de
personas que comparten los mismos ideales. Nos encanta reciclar, proteger el
medio ambiente, disfrutar de un atardecer 
y contribuir a nuestra sociedad.
Mi nombre es Marcelo
y soy el creador del Proyecto GreenRoute. Este proyecto tiene su origen hace
varios años cuando trabajaba para el Gobierno de Chile como encargado del área
de tecnologías de la información.
Un fin de semana el
servidor principal dejó de funcionar. Tratamos de arreglarlo, pero por
desgracia no fue posible. Mis colegas y yo tuvimos que improvisar y nos dirigimos
al cementerio de computadores (computadores 
desechados por otros departamentos) y construimos otro servidor.
Fue fantástico, este
viejo servidor funcionó  durante 3
semanas.
Como la experiencia
había sido exitosa, volvimos al cementerio y restauramos seis computadoras más.
Estábamos reciclando, reutilizando y reduciendo.
Desafortunadamente  no todos los componentes de un dispositivo
electrónico pueden ser reutilizados y es aquí es donde comienza el problema.
La cantidad de
basura electrónica mundial alcanzó 41,8 millones de toneladas en 2014, según un
nuevo informe de la Universidad de las Naciones Unidas. Chile, mi país, ocupa
el primer lugar en América Latina como generador de residuos electrónicos.
Entonces me hice dos
preguntas
¿Qué puedo hacer?
Y mi respuesta fue
impedir que los  residuos electrónicos
lleguen al  medio ambiente.
¿Cómo puedo hacerlo?
A través de una
planta de reciclaje electrónico.
Un día, en
una conversación informal con mis amigos, nos dimos cuenta de que  todos teníamos las mismas prácticas. Reciclar
en casa, utilizar cargadores solares y compartir nuestros automóviles.
El reciclaje
y cuidado por el medio ambiente era parte de nuestras vidas. Ese mismo día
Gonzalo y María e Ivette  aceptaron ser parte
del equipo. Ellos tendrían la misión de definir la estructura  y estrategia del proyecto.

Efectos de la basura electrónica
En el medio Ambiente:
·El plástico de
computadores podría tardar hasta mil años en degradarse
·Una pila de
mercurio es capaz de contaminar 600 mil litros de agua
·El Litio, Cadmio
y Níquel presente en algunos residuos electrónicos producen daños irreversibles
en los seres vivos pudiendo causar incluso la muerte.




Greenroute
La característica principal de
nuestro proyecto será la integración.
Queremos crear comunidades comprometidas con el cuidado del medio ambiente 
Queremos ser un puente entre los productores de aparatos electrónicos y los
consumidores.



A través de la educación vamos a conectar a las personas con el cuidado del
medio ambiente.
Puntos
de reciclaje distribuidos en lugares públicos y privados, ferias de reciclaje y
alianzas estratégicas con empresas serán los mecanismos para recuperar los
residuos electrónicos.
Durante el primer año queremos:
· 
Reciclar al menos
8 toneladas de residuos electrónicos.

Convertirnos en una B Corp

· 
Organizar día del
reciclaje en 7 colegios 
Y
crear una gran comunidad de recicladores...
Si logramos
conseguir los fondos necesarios, podremos construir una pequeña planta de
reciclaje electrónico, comprar herramientas, reclutar gente y desarrollar esta
noble actividad.

<p><b>Clean Up North Brooklyn </b></p>
<p>North Brooklyn handles 40% of New York City’s solid waste. More specifically, we handle on average more than 7,000 tons of waste daily, by hosting 15 of NYC’s solid waste transfer stations. These dangerous garbage warehouses are often placed in low income communities and have been shown to be harmful to our health. In fact children living in our North Brooklyn community are many times more likely to develop asthma than the average NY state child. The public health and safety is compromised daily due to diesel fuel pollution, stench, rat infestation, and the powerful industrial perfumes that are used in an attempt to mask the dangerous odors coming from these facilities. The mission of Cleanup North Brooklyn is to demand better air quality, clean up delinquent waste transfer stations, educate our neighbors and fight trash inequity in our borough. </p>

Our Momentum
Cleanup North Brooklyn has made tremendous headway in the two years we have been fighting for change.  After our town meeting on November 30th and with help from Councilman Antonio Reynoso, the NY Department of Sanitation chose to cut their city garbage truck traffic by 50% to the local trash transfer station. This is a massive win that was made possible by the community rising up and standing together.  But with this momentum we are at a critical stage in our cause.  

Our Needs

Our documentary short film, Brooklyn Transfer has been the sharpest weapon in our fight against trash inequity. It has helped get our message to the Daily News, the Department of Sanitation, and the Department of Environmental Conservation. With your help we can finish the film and get it seen by more city agencies. Specifically your donations will go towards camera and sound rentals, editing, and mixing.  In addition, your donations will go towards air quality and noise monitoring. This environmental testing is crucial to our cause.  We also plan to lawyer up so we have a legal voice as we take on a powerful industry with many more resources than our community group. All of the above will help us face off with Five Star Carting which Councilman Reynoso called “the worst of the worst"" in private carting.
