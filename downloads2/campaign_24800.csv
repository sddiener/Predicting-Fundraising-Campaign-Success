<p><b>WHO ARE WE AND WHAT ARE WE DOING</b></p>
<p><b>Original Practice Shakespeare
Festival</b></p>
<p>OPS Fest is a team of performers united by two things: our love of
Shakespeare's plays and our willingness to be part of a dangerous experiment.
""Original Practice,"" or <i>OP</i>
is a technique as well as a goal. We strive to recreate the original conditions
in which these plays were produced to best illuminate the drama and historic
details surrounding the world's greatest English-language writer. </p>
<p>We believe the plays were performed unrehearsed and without a director,
which means even with the help of some unique theatrical skills and features,
things often go weird, or scary, often funny, and sometimes very, very wrong.
And our audiences love it! We're entering our sixth summer and we are so proud
and grateful for the Portland summer Shakespeare fans who have been gathering
by the hundreds to sit in the hot sun or the rain and mud to heckle us. <b>THANK
YOU, PORTLAND!!</b></p>
<p><b>Laurelhurst Festival - The OPS Fest
Challenge</b></p>
<p>Each year, as the company has developed, we've added new titles to our
summer touring calendar, and each year, we celebrate our new record in a
Laurelhurst Festival, mounting each of the shows in our repertoire once, all in
one place, one after another. It's the peak of our season, a huge chunk of our
summer performances, and it takes place in beautiful and beloved Laurelhurst
Park in SE Portland, so it's lots of fun for the neighbors.</p>
<p>Initially we added one new comedy a year, then expanded to one comedy and
one tragedy. This summer brings a total of nine different plays to our season,
and Laurelhurst Festival 2014 will span two weekends, <span>Friday, July 18 - Sunday July 27</span>. (Our poor apprentices
even have a three-show-day to look forward to!) We hope to eventually test our
mettle, muscle, and memories against the model of the 16th century masters,
whose schedule regularly involved producing six different plays in six days, or
seasons consisting of 26 performances of 16 different plays, a couple of which
would be premieres!</p>
<p><b>Become a Patron of the New Old Arts</b></p>
<p>Please support our efforts by making a monetary gift towards our Laurelhurst
Festival. As fascinating as it is to run into the same limiting factors as our
predecessors - the original Original Practicioners - we are not solely
conducting the <i>OP</i> experiment as an
exercise. Our performers do step into the shoes of 16th century professionals
and walk miles in them all summer long, so we are less excited about exploring
how they struggled with their model than where it succeeds in 21st century
Portland.</p>
<p>Read further to learn more about supporting our festival, what it means to
OPS, and what we have to offer your community. Or, if you're ready to give,
check out the sidebar to the right of your screen and find a level of giving
that matches your means and your corresponding gift!</p>
<p><b>THE DEAL</b></p>
<p><b>What We Need...</b></p>
<p>Our shows are always free, so we depend on audience donations to cover
costs, plus grants and the support of schools and a few private theatre
patrons. The base rate for actors to cast this years Laurelhurst Festival alone
will cost approximately $4,000!</p>
<p>We humbly request the support of those in our community with the means to
<b>help us raise $4,500</b> - a substantial portion of our operating budget, symbolic
of mounting the Laurelhurst Festival. As catchy as it sounds to ask you to
""Pay an actor's salary!"" this year, our success in this season's
campaign will determine our operating budget for next year's festival. We would
love to show you what we can do with a significant increase in production
value! But none of our actors will be going hungry this summer.</p>
<p>Of course we don't expect all our supporters to be season sponsors. When you
join us in the park, we'll ask you to drop a small contribution into a
post-show bucket (our version of passing the hat), and if you are able to give
more than spare change or cash on hand, we will gladly accept a check or credit
card donation on site. Huge thanks to everyone who has given and continues to
give regularly in person. We can't do it without you.</p>
<p><b>...And What You Get</b></p>
<p>If you are prepared to make a larger scale donation to our Laurelhurst fest,
thank you in advance! And please check out the many awesome and hilarious
rewards for giving. Patrons of Shakespeare's company were known to favor
individual actors, sometimes directly supporting them with personal tips or
gifts, sometimes voting with their wallets in other ways, expanding an actor's
wardrobe to help him appear wealthier and more attractive on stage, perhaps in
turn helping him win larger, more impressive roles. Although we encourage
supporters to give on an organizational level, we've taken some inspiration
from the older economic structure in designing your perks...</p>
<p>Sponsor an actor and you have the option to have a creative exchange over a
role, perhaps inspiring the kind of character, costume, or behaviors you'll see
on stage. Business owner? Running for office? Shakespeare's plays are
notoriously referential - his audience was used to hearing jabs at rival
playwrights, shout outs to favorite taverns, or send ups of contemporary
political figures. Find a level of support that works for you and you could
orchestrate a better (not to mention more historically accurate) ad lib than we
alone can pull off. (See the full list of perks and levels of giving to the
right.)</p>
<p>If we don't make our goal this summer, we may not be able to expand to an
eleven-show festival next season, but all proceeds will certainly still go
towards then development of the company, primarily paying theatre practicioners
to exercise their skills on and off stage.</p>
<p><b>WHY?</b></p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>OPS Fest has been developing our own version of cue script technique over the
past six summers, based on the pragmatics of the contemporary stage. (For
example, we now allow women to perform!) Many of our long-time performers have
begun to master the tricky combination of subtle text analysis, vocal and
physical athleticism, and improvisation skills through a combination of
training and some truly rigorous experience, impossible to recreate without a
viable company. This invaluable development of the performer is not only a gift
to our audiences, but also increases their personal value in other theatre
circles and careers.</p>
<p>With the help of Ronni Lacroute and the Willakenzie estate, we've been able
to hire professional actors at far more competitive rates and find ourselves a
home in the local theatre community, sharing actors with sister companies such
as Portland Actors Ensemble, Anon It Moves, Portland Shakespeare Project, Fuse
Theatre Ensemble, Post 5 Theatre, and Northwest Classical Theatre, among many
others, and participating in the city-wide Complete Works Festival - two years
to mount all of Shakespeare's plays and poems in honor of the 450th anniversary
of his birth and 400th anniversary of his death. Next year, we'll be adding
Richard III and Merry Wives of Windsor to our cannon as our contribution to
this festival.</p>
<p>The last piece of the puzzle is accessibility. We do our part by keeping
costs low so we can expand the reach of our free-of-cost tour into more and
diverse neighborhoods. We are able to do this by honing our improvisation
skills, trusting our actors, and streamlining production design to match that
of <i>The King's Men</i> - an impressively a
sustainable model. Relative to the modern tradition of massive set construction
and architectural verisimilitude, our universal set is lightweight, compact,
and reusable. That and minimal properties are able to meet actors on location
in just one pickup truck, so we are able travel all over the greater Portland
metro area and beyond. </p>
<p>Now we need you to do your part – assuming our post-show bucket donations
stay consistent with previous years, this Indegogo campaign must earn $4,500.
That way, we'll be on track for next summer's even larger festival, more and
more experienced actors, more extensive training for an ever-growing list of
roles, and staffing a few 12-hour production marathons. Not only is it a stunt,
but the shows are FUN! Come see for yourself why kids of all ages makes our
seasons an integral part of their summer.</p>
<p><b>HOW?</b></p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>Shakespeare depicts actors as talented, mentally gymnastic, and
hungry.  OPS is proud to focus our annual budget on paying the artists,
but 16th century London was a grim period in which to struggle financially, and
actors generally did, often oscillating between feast and famine. 400 years
later, the state of the arts has evolved, but not been drastically overhauled.
Though the theatre is still a hub of cultural life (perhaps most obvious on the
summer park tour circuit), live performance competes with countless forms of
audio/visual entertainment and other media to bring people together. We have
not yet escaped the challenges of arts funding.</p>
<p>OPS Fest also demands a great deal of training and outside preparation from
the actor, and for this investment we are dedicated to paying a competitive
wage. We offer training in techniques unique even within the Shakespeare
community, and qualified performers may play upwards of a dozen roles in one
season. Not all performers are prepared to make this kind of commitment to one
writer.</p>
<p>We understand that not everyone can support live theatre like Queen
Elizabeth. This is one reason that, at least economically, we veer from the
16th century model: to celebrate the quality of living that came with the civil
rights movement. YOU, our audience, can afford to support the humane treatment
of actors!</p>
<p><b>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</b></p>
<p><b>Hear the Plays</b></p>
<p>As one famous title character says, <i>The
play's the thing</i>. Monetary contributions help us operate, <b>but our raison
d'être is, of course, mounting as many plays as we can squeeze between Midsummer
and Labor Day</b>, and as accessibly as possible. It's just<b> not a play without an
audience</b>, so check out the touring calendar on our website, <a href=""http://www.opsfest.org/tour-calendar.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.opsfest.org/tour-calendar.html</a>,

alone can pull off. (See the full list of perks and levels of giving to the
right.)
If we don't make our goal this summer, we may not be able to expand to an
eleven-show festival next season, but all proceeds will certainly still go
towards then development of the company, primarily paying theatre practicioners
to exercise their skills on and off stage.
WHY?
The Impact
OPS Fest has been developing our own version of cue script technique over the
past six summers, based on the pragmatics of the contemporary stage. (For
example, we now allow women to perform!) Many of our long-time performers have
begun to master the tricky combination of subtle text analysis, vocal and
physical athleticism, and improvisation skills through a combination of
training and some truly rigorous experience, impossible to recreate without a
viable company. This invaluable development of the performer is not only a gift
to our audiences, but also increases their personal value in other theatre
circles and careers.
With the help of Ronni Lacroute and the Willakenzie estate, we've been able
to hire professional actors at far more competitive rates and find ourselves a
home in the local theatre community, sharing actors with sister companies such
as Portland Actors Ensemble, Anon It Moves, Portland Shakespeare Project, Fuse
Theatre Ensemble, Post 5 Theatre, and Northwest Classical Theatre, among many
others, and participating in the city-wide Complete Works Festival - two years
to mount all of Shakespeare's plays and poems in honor of the 450th anniversary
of his birth and 400th anniversary of his death. Next year, we'll be adding
Richard III and Merry Wives of Windsor to our cannon as our contribution to
this festival.
The last piece of the puzzle is accessibility. We do our part by keeping
costs low so we can expand the reach of our free-of-cost tour into more and
diverse neighborhoods. We are able to do this by honing our improvisation
skills, trusting our actors, and streamlining production design to match that
of The King's Men - an impressively a
sustainable model. Relative to the modern tradition of massive set construction
and architectural verisimilitude, our universal set is lightweight, compact,
and reusable. That and minimal properties are able to meet actors on location
in just one pickup truck, so we are able travel all over the greater Portland
metro area and beyond. 
Now we need you to do your part – assuming our post-show bucket donations
stay consistent with previous years, this Indegogo campaign must earn $4,500.
That way, we'll be on track for next summer's even larger festival, more and
more experienced actors, more extensive training for an ever-growing list of
roles, and staffing a few 12-hour production marathons. Not only is it a stunt,
but the shows are FUN! Come see for yourself why kids of all ages makes our
seasons an integral part of their summer.
HOW?
Risks & Challenges
Shakespeare depicts actors as talented, mentally gymnastic, and
hungry.  OPS is proud to focus our annual budget on paying the artists,
but 16th century London was a grim period in which to struggle financially, and
actors generally did, often oscillating between feast and famine. 400 years
later, the state of the arts has evolved, but not been drastically overhauled.
Though the theatre is still a hub of cultural life (perhaps most obvious on the
summer park tour circuit), live performance competes with countless forms of
audio/visual entertainment and other media to bring people together. We have
not yet escaped the challenges of arts funding.
OPS Fest also demands a great deal of training and outside preparation from
the actor, and for this investment we are dedicated to paying a competitive
wage. We offer training in techniques unique even within the Shakespeare
community, and qualified performers may play upwards of a dozen roles in one
season. Not all performers are prepared to make this kind of commitment to one
writer.
We understand that not everyone can support live theatre like Queen
Elizabeth. This is one reason that, at least economically, we veer from the
16th century model: to celebrate the quality of living that came with the civil
rights movement. YOU, our audience, can afford to support the humane treatment
of actors!
OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP
Hear the Plays
As one famous title character says, The
play's the thing. Monetary contributions help us operate, but our raison
d'être is, of course, mounting as many plays as we can squeeze between Midsummer
and Labor Day, and as accessibly as possible. It's just not a play without an
audience, so check out the touring calendar on our website, http://www.opsfest.org/tour-calendar.html,
and share it with your friends!

</div><div>Tre donne, tre classi sociali.</div><div>Guerra.</div><div>Una crocerossina, una postina, una madrina di guerra. </div><div>Durante la guerra i soldati scrivevano lettere alle loro famiglie dettandole alle crocerossine, le madrine scrivevano ai soldati per mantenere alto il loro spirito e molte donne si ritrovarono a fare lavori cosiddetti maschili tra cui le postine. Questo il trait d'union tra le tre: le lettere. Un territorio di relazione che unisce queste tre donne, questi tre ruoli, che le aiuta ad affrontare l'insensatezza, il dolore e la fatica che la guerra richiede.

Buongiorno! Siamo Daiana, Gaia, Irene. Siamo donne, attrici, mogli e madri professioniste che cercano un ' armonia tra vita artistica e vita quotidiana.Uno degli scopi principali della nostra associazione teatrale ""Har Baje"" è coltivare e supportare gli aspetti dell' essere donna.
Fin' ora abbiamo provveduto alla produzione dei nostri spettacoli autofinanziandoci,  vorremmo con questa campagna alzare ulteriormente il livello artistico.Per farlo necessitiamo di fondi da utilizzare per pagare: prove, scenografie, costumi e materiale promozionale.Ecco perchè abbiamo bisogno di voi!
IL PROGETTO
2015. Centesimo anniversario della Grande Guerra.Facciamo uno spettacolo che la ricordi?Leggiamo libri sulle donne dell' epoca...Perchè?Perchè siamo donne.Scopriamo cose.Nascono i ruoli, la relazione tra loro.Iniziamo a scrivere il testo.E' un pozzo che ci parla di guerra, di donne.Di noi?""Guerra?memoria feroce che adesso ritorna a questa domandanoi stesse di fronte.""Allora per dicembre facciamo un primo studio?Sì!Sabato 13 dicembre ore 20.00 spazio Har Baje via Zuretti 47 milano.Ma ci servono soldi!Soldi per continuare a studiare, a scrivere, a provare...soldi per materiali e competenze...soldi per lavorare meglio e in meno tempo!Ci aiutate voi?Voi come risorsa, voi come amici, voi come pubblico.Per dare corpo a un'idea che già c'è e che funziona.Grazie.
LO SPETTACOLO IN BREVE
Tre donne, tre classi sociali.Guerra.Una crocerossina, una postina, una madrina di guerra. Durante la guerra i soldati scrivevano lettere alle loro famiglie dettandole alle crocerossine, le madrine scrivevano ai soldati per mantenere alto il loro spirito e molte donne si ritrovarono a fare lavori cosiddetti maschili tra cui le postine. Questo il trait d'union tra le tre: le lettere. Un territorio di relazione che unisce queste tre donne, questi tre ruoli, che le aiuta ad affrontare l'insensatezza, il dolore e la fatica che la guerra richiede. Una guerra insensata come lo sono tutte  le guerre.
LE RICOMPENSE PER VOI

<h3>~ my story ~</h3>
<p>Hi my name is Christine Armand, I'm a drama teacher, writer, and an actress. But, first and foremost I am one heARTsy momma. I try to live creatively with compassion and connection to the world, all the while trying to mother a lovely young lady on her own awesome journey though this thing called life. After she was born 12 years ago, I joined a group of women and we wrote a play about motherhood. It came out of our common experiences of what it was like to be a new mother...to suddenly have this amazing little soul under your roof...this gorgeous foreign creature born of your heart. And, how incredible the beginning of this new life...And no, I'm not talking about the baby...everybody talks about the baby. I'm talking about ~ the momma~. We often forget that when a baby is born, so too is <strong>a mother.</strong> And as life-changing and extraordinary as it was, it was also mired with challenges, unmet expectations, lots and lots of spit up, and well...stretchmarks. Literally and metaphorically...from all that growing. This was the kind of stuff noone really talked about in ""those books"" like <em>What to Expect When you're Expecting.</em> So we tackled the subject with honesty and humour (and lots of wine) and realized there was so much to say. Looking around, we noticed there was this voice missing...the voice that needed to say...wow, this is not what I thought it would be. And this is amazingly beautiful, but this is really f**king hard. And boy do we really need each other. We realized it was a sensitive topic, and that people might think we were Momsters...but after developing the play and putting it on in a real live theater, we were stoked to find that we weren't the only ones who felt that way. In fact, the feedback was overwhelming. I had new mothers in tears, thanking me for expressing exactly what they had been feeling. Some of them hadn't had a moment to themselves out with friends in 6 months since their babies were born. And they were thrilled to be in the land of grownups (with wine!) It seemed not only moms identifited, but poppas too. And grandmas and even non-parents were touched and found something they could identify with in the characters and how they were all on this journey of growth. We also manage to infuse a lot of laughter and in the end it's basically a love story, which was the goal. So, the play was a hit, and every time we have produced it, we have sold out each show. We haven't done it in 6 years, and I think it's time to bring it back and take it to the next level. So my goal this time around is threefold. First to refine it and make it even better. Secondly to have it be seen by a wider audience. And also to use it to ""give back"" to the worldwide community of Mommas. Because I believe that Motherhood is the ultimate symbol of life and love and it needs to be protected in order for us to thrive. And it's true that if Momma ain't happy, ain't nobody happy!</p>
<p>The upcoming production in San Francisco is just in time for Mother's Day. Come join us for a pampering momma playdate.<br/>Enjoy a flash makeover by the fabulous Makeup Gourmet hiimself and his team of artistes. Shop for awesome makeup products. Have a momosa while having your ne<span>ck rubbed by a masseuse. Chat with other mommas while enjoying a glass o' vino without a kid sitting on your lap. Then enter the ""womb room"" for an intimate showing of the popular play ""Stretchmarks: Growing Into Motherhood."" A play that takes you on a journey of 3 new moms, who get a lesson in what not to expect when you're expecting (or not expecting). <br/><br/>Starring:<br/>Christine Armand<br/>Shani Marie Harris-Bagwell<br/>Mary Jo Price<br/>and<br/>Trish DeBaun as Mother Nature<br/><br/>Dates: <br/>May 11, 12, 18, 19 8pm<br/>May 13, 20 1pm matinee <br/><br/>Tickets: $20 in advance, $25 at the door<br/>You can buy them online here:<br/><br/><a class=""widget-link"" href=""https://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/237875"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><span>https://</span><span>www.brownpapertickets.com/</span>event/237875</a><br/><br/>Limited seating, and we usually sell out, so buy your tickets today.<br/>Help save the mommas from the drama! </span></p>

<h3>~ mompowerment ~</h3>
<p>The play not only encourages community and connection through its theme, but it  actually does bring women together. We've had many mother's groups come see us, and even use us for their fundraising events and get togethers. Watching our play people have said is a an overall enlightening experience. People laugh and cry and then they have discussions that  maybe they wouldn't have had before. We've had women say seeing this play sparked many interesting talks and brought important issues to the foreground. The experience bonds mommas together and makes them appreciate the fact that there is this whole great big posse of mommas who have their back. I also plan on using the play as a means of ""giving back"" to organizations that empower mothers and protect mother earth. This time in particular, I am donating a portion of the proceeds to  <a href=""http://www.onemama.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.onemama.org</a> . </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>~ what I need ~</h3>
<p>A little rebirth never hurt anyone. :-)</p>
<p>I am asking for 5000 to help get the play back on it's feet. This will go towards production costs for the upcoming run. I will be producing, directing, and acting in the play this time around. Production costs include marketing materials, making the website <a href=""http://www.themommadrama"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.themommadrama</a>. com more professional and user friendly. Props, actress fees, facility fees, and technical aspects. (We are putting together a cool projection to use as a back piece.)</p>
<p>I also plan on entering the play into the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in Scotland in August, and part of this money raised would go to registration fees and venue rental. Which is pretty costly, but an amazing opportunity to showcase the play on a wider scale. I have participated in the Fringe before, and know how it works. I believe the play would kick ass over there, and would give it global exposure.</p>
<p>I am also developing the idea of using this as a ""pop-up"" play that could be performed anywhere in the world. We would use skype for casting and rehearsals and take the play to that community with only a few days to MomGyver it together and just make it work. It would be a wild and wonderful adventure. Kind of like motherhood! Then part of the proceeds would go to a local momma-focused charity.</p>
<p> Your contribution will not only be funding an entertaining and meaningful artistic project, but it will also help to create a positive supportive platform for mothering communities and also giving back to worthy causes world wide.  </p>

<h3>~ other ways you can help a momma out ~</h3>
<p>Please spread the word about the play, and if you are in the Bay Area, please treat your favorite Momma to a day of entertainment and pampering. If you live afar, and would like the play to come to your momma community, please contact me for a play date. Also if you know of any organizations/causes that have  mothers and mother earth as their focus, and you think it would be a good fit for our play...please let me know. </p>

CunamacuÃ©, founded in 2010, is a music and dance ensemble which promotes the continuity of Afro-Peruvian culture using its music and dance as a vehicle for self-expression.

CunamacuÃ© will be going on tour to PerÃº in August of this year.  We have been invited to perform at the 2nd Annual Festival Cultural KutukÃ¡ in CaÃ±ete, PerÃº. The festival is aimed at rescuing the culture, and highlighting the importance of people of African descent in PerÃº via lectures, demonstrations, and performances.

<p><strong>Village Playback Theatre is an innovative company dedicated to telling the stories of people who struggle to be heard.</strong> For over a decade, our company has listened to audience members' personal stories and crafted them into improvised performances that make a powerful impact on both the tellers and their communities. Based in New York City, we provide a meaningful theater experience for many people whose access may be limited.</p>
<p>We perform on location: in hospitals and schools, community centers and senior centers, day treatment programs and prisons. We have performed for audiences coping with mental illness, addictions, homelessness, histories of incarceration and physical and cognitive disabilities. <strong>No matter the setting, seeing a story ""played back"" can bring a tremendous sense of validation and belonging. </strong></p>
<p>Playback Theatre is a form that draws from improvisation and traditional storytelling. Created in 1975 in the United States, it is now practiced around the world in over 50 countries.</p>
<p><strong>We all have a need to be heard, but a fear of being judged or viewed as “having something wrong” can make it difficult to speak.  </strong>A genuine invitation to talk, in front of an attentive listener, makes it easier. We believe everyone deserves the chance to be simply asked <strong>""What's your story?""</strong></p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>What We Need</strong></h3>
<p><strong>This year, we've decided to focus our work on reaching out to the mentally ill in our community, and we need your help to make it happen.   </strong>We’d like to increase the impact of our work this year by going for depth, not breadth, and have dedicated ourselves to finding new and meaningful ways to reach out to individuals struggling with mental illness, their families, and care providers. It’s work we’re passionate about, but it comes with some challenges. <strong>Funding for services for the mentally ill in our city is critically low.</strong> <strong>Many of the organizations that could most benefit from a VPT performance are least able to hire us.</strong> We want to make sure we can reach as many people as possible.<br/><br/>Additionally, VPT is growing. We want to reach more people, so we’ve hired more actors and musicians. We also want to make sure we’re as well trained and well equipped as we can be to undertake the work we’ve planned for ourselves, which means training our members, and learning new performance techniques. Here are some of our company goals for this year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide pro-bono performances for organizations serving the mentally ill, their families, and their care providers.</li>
<li>Send each of our members to Anti-Racism Training to increase our understanding of struggles and bias that affect many in our audiences.</li>
<li>Secure new space for regular rehearsals: our rehearsal space, once provided for us at no cost, has been lost due building damages.</li>
</ul><p>Looking at these plans, we believe we can accomplish our goals with a minimum budget of $8,000. If we don't make our goal, all funds raised will still go directly to our work this season, but our scope will be more limited: less shows for underserved communities, less training for our actors, less equipment. We'll maintain our focus, but we'd love to pursue this season's goals to the fullest. </p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The funds raised in this campaign will have a direct effect on the lives of people with mental illness in our community.</strong> One in five Americans have had their lives touched by mental illness, and yet for many people it remains an invisible disease: the fear of stigma and misunderstanding prevents sufferers from telling their stories. Through Playback Theatre, we can send the message that these stories are valuable and deserve to be heard.  <br/><br/><strong>Playback Theatre increases empathy for others and provide a new perspective on an experience.</strong> Often, storytellers feel comfortable ""opening up"" in a way they may not feel comfortable expressing themselves elsewhere. Playback brings people together and strengthens the bonds of communities.</p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>If you're not in a position to donate, we understand...there are other ways to get involved that would still be a big help! Please assist us in spreading the word about our campaign by telling friends, families, coworkers--anyone you think might be interested in our work. Giving us a shout out on social media is also much appreciated: Indiegogo gives you some tools for sharing right here on the site to make it easy.<br/><br/>Thanks so much for your interest and your generosity. We hope you'll join our Village this season!</p>

<p>It’s been an amazing decade, and we wouldn’t be here without the support of our community, our sponsors, and most of all <strong>you, our audience</strong>.</p>
<p>This year <span class=""caps"">VIIF</span>, like many BC-based arts organizations, watched our government funding vanish into thin air. <strong>BC now only designates $4.50 per person towards arts funding, which is less than 20% of the national average, and the lowest in the country</strong>. (For more information, may we recommend <a href=""http://www.stopbcartscuts.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Stop BC Arts Cuts</a>?)</p>
<p>Improvisers are, by nature, creatures of action. That’s why, in the spirit of our friends at <a href=""http://www.ghostjailtheatre.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ghost Jail Theatre</a> and their fundraising initiative, the Ghost Jail 100, we’re asking for your help with the <span class=""caps"">VIIF</span> 200. <strong>We want 200 people to give $20 each</strong>, an amount of money that makes up for any provincial funding <span class=""caps"">VIIF</span> might have received this year.</p>
<p>What does your $20 buy? The venue, for one. The refreshments for guests like yourselves. The staff. But moreso: your $20 helps pay the <strong>artists’ fees</strong> to bring great improvisers to the fest from all over the world. It pays the directors to travel here and teach (both to our guests and to the local theatre and arts community). And it allows those improvisers and directors (and you!) to take what they’ve learned and created back to their own communities across the globe.</p>

<p>Welcome to the <span class=""caps"">VIIF</span> 200.<br/><strong><em><span class=""caps"">VIVE</span> LE <span class=""caps"">VIIF</span>!</em></strong></p></div>","The 11th Annual Vancouver International Improv Festival takes place October 5-9, 2010 at the beautiful Performance Works Theatre on Granville Island.
It’s been an amazing decade, and we wouldn’t be here without the support of our community, our sponsors, and most of all you, our audience.
This year VIIF, like many BC-based arts organizations, watched our government funding vanish into thin air. BC now only designates $4.50 per person towards arts funding, which is less than 20% of the national average, and the lowest in the country. (For more information, may we recommend Stop BC Arts Cuts?)
Improvisers are, by nature, creatures of action. That’s why, in the spirit of our friends at Ghost Jail Theatre and their fundraising initiative, the Ghost Jail 100, we’re asking for your help with the VIIF 200. We want 200 people to give $20 each, an amount of money that makes up for any provincial funding VIIF might have received this year.
What does your $20 buy? The venue, for one. The refreshments for guests like yourselves. The staff. But moreso: your $20 helps pay the artists’ fees to bring great improvisers to the fest from all over the world. It pays the directors to travel here and teach (both to our guests and to the local theatre and arts community). And it allows those improvisers and directors (and you!) to take what they’ve learned and created back to their own communities across the globe.
In other words, your $20 does something incredible: It recognizes the value of theatre and art in the community, in Canada, and internationally.
But it doesn’t stop there—$20 is a generous donation, but we welcome your contributions at any level. Take a look at the options, and feel free to email us at viif200@gmail.com with any questions you might have.

So why a solo show? Solo theatre is magical. This artform first hyponitized me when I watched the exceptional Nilaja Sun perform her critically acclaimed solo show, No Child. A year later, I became the first understudy for Ms. Sun and went on to perform the show for 6 weeks in Vermont. No Child raised the bar on my goals as an artist; I live for the surprise that every project provides and the lingering soulful, communal moments that storytelling evokes.What We Need & What You Get
We have a fabulous team working to bring the world premiere of this production to the Hollywood Fringe Festival in Los Angeles (June 2013); however, this show is an independent theater production with little to no financial backing. Your financial support ensures that we can bring this unique project to life! And, guess what? You are doing a double-good-deed. We pledge to donate 10% of all ticket proceeds to Mama Hope, a non-profit with a mission to “Stop the Pity and Unlock the Potential” in several African communities www.mamahope.org. We dig Mama Hope, and we believe their goal resonates with the heart of this project. 
Thank you for supporting Take Me To The Poorhouse, and in turn, Mama Hope.
You double-do-gooder! ;-)Your contribution will assist with essential components of our new production:

REVIEWS (For NO CHILD)

“Wilson’s performance was a marvel… in a twinkle, she transforms…no simple parlor trick: all 16 characters, the funny and the shocking, rang true. Wilson brought a raw depth to the character …who continued to fight the good fight but slowly wearied of the struggle”-BENNINGTON BANNER
“It is a wonderfully fluid 70-minute tour-de-force for an actress and Liz Femi does not disappoint…she makes it all so effortless…”–BRATTLEBORO REFORMER

<p><strong>A new presentation of David Auburn's play <em>Proof, </em>winner of the 2001 Pulitzer Prize and 2001 Tony Award for Best Playis being shown in New York City December 7th through December 9th of 2012. <em>Proof</em> tells the story of Catherine, a brilliant young woman who wrestles with not only inheriting her father's mathematical genius, but also potentially his mental instability. The story also goes into issues of a family that is in many ways distant from each other, the question of authenticity in one's work, and the choices one makes in figuring out their identity. This version brings the back porch of the Chicago household that becomes the center of a dramatic series of events, and transports it to an initimate setting where potent storytelling is present for all audience members to witness. </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Who Is Involved With This?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>This production is being produced and directed by myself, Jordan Friedman, a young theatrical director residing in New York City. I have a passion for creating theatre and telling stories with the dramatic text, the work of designers and other production staff, and the effort put in by all of the actors. I also believe that things that may appear simple on the surface can contain complexity when observed in depth, and as a result there can be truly powerful and poignant moments in theatre. This notion is something I always keep in mind when pursuing my work. This is my first full-length production in New York City, and I am very passioniate, excited, and determine to make this worthwhile for all. There are also very talented designers and actors working to help shape and define the world of<em> Proof. </em></strong></p>
<h2>
<strong><em> </em></strong><strong>Why Should You Contribute?</strong>
</h2>
<p><strong>You should contribute to this campaign because in order to keep the theatrical culture and pulse alive not only in New York City but within the entire world, new artists need to have their talent be shown and new creative sparks need to fly. If young theatre does not get the opportunity to be seen, then the entire theatrical art cannot generate new followers and new potential artists. By contributing to this campaign, you are providing audience members an opportunity to see theatre that respects the intelligence of everybody involved, and can be the gateway to a bright future for both the artists and the audiences. My craft is something that I take very seriously, and I would greatly appreciate the support those who also value theatre seriously, whether you are an artist or an audience member.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>What Are These Funds Going Towards?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>The money raised on this campaign will contribute towards the various expenses involved in bringing <em>Proof</em> to life. These include:</strong></p>
<p><strong>*Helping to cover expenses involved in royalties for producing the show.</strong></p>
<p><strong>*Contributing to the rental of our performance space.</strong></p>
<p><strong>*Providing designers the budget to use all of their talent and create the best scenery, lights, costumes, and sounds that can be generated.</strong></p>
<p><strong>*Marketing the show through a variety of media and techniques and reaching out to as many potential audience members as possible.</strong></p>
<p><strong>*Compensating the actors and production staff for all of the effort that they put towards in this production.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Doing this in New York City is not the easiest task, so every and any contribution to help achieve those goals is appreciated more than words can express. </strong></p>
<h2><strong>How Can You Help?</strong></h2>
<p><strong> The most direct method of helping this production and everybody involved in it is to contribute to this campaign. Any amount is appreciated, although depending on the specific amount you can claim rewards for your efforts such as being featured in our programs, special video messages from the cast and crew, an invitation to one of our rehearsals, and even a producer credit. If you can not make a monetary contribution, you can still provide invaluable support by sharing this campaign to as many people as possible and share the word and idea of creating exciting theatre in New York City.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>In Conclusion:</strong></h2>
<p><strong>On a personal level, I would like to sincerely thank everybody who reads this campaign and is willing to provide support either directly or indirectly in creating art that people truly believe in. The assistance that is provided is invaluable to me and everybody working on this show. If you choose to donate to this show or help spread the word, I will give everything I have to make sure your effort goes towards something very meaningful.</strong></p>

You should contribute to this campaign because in order to keep the theatrical culture and pulse alive not only in New York City but within the entire world, new artists need to have their talent be shown and new creative sparks need to fly. If young theatre does not get the opportunity to be seen, then the entire theatrical art cannot generate new followers and new potential artists. By contributing to this campaign, you are providing audience members an opportunity to see theatre that respects the intelligence of everybody involved, and can be the gateway to a bright future for both the artists and the audiences. My craft is something that I take very seriously, and I would greatly appreciate the support those who also value theatre seriously, whether you are an artist or an audience member.
What Are These Funds Going Towards?
The money raised on this campaign will contribute towards the various expenses involved in bringing Proof to life. These include:
*Helping to cover expenses involved in royalties for producing the show.
*Contributing to the rental of our performance space.
*Providing designers the budget to use all of their talent and create the best scenery, lights, costumes, and sounds that can be generated.
*Marketing the show through a variety of media and techniques and reaching out to as many potential audience members as possible.
*Compensating the actors and production staff for all of the effort that they put towards in this production.
Doing this in New York City is not the easiest task, so every and any contribution to help achieve those goals is appreciated more than words can express. 
How Can You Help?
 The most direct method of helping this production and everybody involved in it is to contribute to this campaign. Any amount is appreciated, although depending on the specific amount you can claim rewards for your efforts such as being featured in our programs, special video messages from the cast and crew, an invitation to one of our rehearsals, and even a producer credit. If you can not make a monetary contribution, you can still provide invaluable support by sharing this campaign to as many people as possible and share the word and idea of creating exciting theatre in New York City.
In Conclusion:
On a personal level, I would like to sincerely thank everybody who reads this campaign and is willing to provide support either directly or indirectly in creating art that people truly believe in. The assistance that is provided is invaluable to me and everybody working on this show. If you choose to donate to this show or help spread the word, I will give everything I have to make sure your effort goes towards something very meaningful.",0.0,0,"6 Campaigns

WHO WE ARE
 
HISTORY
 
The three co-founders of PIECE
Theatre each hold a unique journey from New Haven to New York. 
 
One moved to Japan to study Theatre
and led a successful transition from actor to director before finishing his
degree. Another forwent the degree altogether, moved into the tech room of the
world famous LIVING Theatre, and grounded his acting career in the deep roots
of activism. And the third finished his degree early and travelled the world –
a playwright moonlighting as a volunteer vagabond – eventually creating drama
education programs for the youth in both South Africa and the South Pacific.
 
During their journeys, these three
New Haven boys kept in touch and continued searching for opportunities to
collaborate on theatre projects. As a result, before the formation of PIECE
Theatre, they had tested their bonds, beliefs and aspirations by collaborating
in three off-Broadway productions of original work. The 2011-2012 season
will be the first they share together, firmly united under a single banner.
 
PIECE Theatre is a New York City
based Theatre Company that exists to create new works about our shared
humanity.
 

MISSION
 
PIECE is an ensemble-based theatre company located in New
York City. We are dedicated to the exploration and innovation of storytelling
because we believe expression binds our fragmented humanity. It is through
consistent and collaborative endeavors to share stories with each other that we
attempt to piece ourselves together. PIECE Theatre creates new works, while
running storytelling education programs for both children and adults, with a
clear mission: to always trust the theatrical process as it illuminates the
puzzle of our existence one piece at a time.

 
 
OUR PROJECT
 
Since its inception in 2007, we have
performed this play in art galleries, parks, cemeteries, living rooms, public
access television stations, and off-Broadway theaters.
 
PIECE Theatre is proud to bring CRACKED
(Upon a Time) back to New York City.
 
With your help, CRACKED (Upon a
Time) will finally have the
showcase we believe it deserves: a two week run this October at TheaterLab - Manhattan’s premiere theatre salon for experimental theatre.
 
 
CRACKED (Upon a
Time)
by
Josiah Houston
 
Three chairs sit at the foot of a graveyard. Alfred's chair,
Percy's chair, and the Death Seat. Alfred, an older man, is writing into a
large black leather bound book. But in the end it is Percy, an old man, who
labors upon the blank page. In the Game of Life the potent ramblings and
hysterical bickering between these ancient companions explore memory, allusion,
love, luck, fear, trust, choices to be made, time to be passed, and the desire
to avoid ending before they conclude that - EVERYMAN MUST GO THROUGH LIFE ON
HIS OWN.
 

 
WE NEED YOUR HELP
 
Our Expenses:
Cost of an average, mid-sized rehearsal studio in
Manhattan: $35
3 nights a week for 3 hours for 4 weeks: $1,260
Two weekends of 8 shows in a 60 seat theater downtown: $2300
Props for one low budget show: $400
Wigs & Costumes: $300
Promotional Materials: $300
Copies of full length script for actors and crew. $100
501(c)(3) filing: $400


 
This project has been a part of our lives for many years and
it is time to show the world what we've been working on. 


Your donations will afford us the opportunity to rent a
dynamic theater space and promote our project in one of the most competitive
theatre cities in the world.  


Thank you for your time and consideration.
Without your donations, this project would be
impossible.

<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<h3>Indiegogo Campaign for Last Import - Behind the Veil. </h3>
<p>My passion project, I have been building my solo show for the past three years. As the first actress in my family (and the first Iranian actress to graduate Columbia's MFA acting program in 2009), I feel passionately that stories of resilience deserve a voice and an audience. </p>
<h3><strong>Last Import is of Import</strong></h3>
<p>Resilience is instrumental to sustainable living and finding forgiveness in the most challenging of circumstances. The characters in Last Import are tangible and sometimes surreal; all of them are women and girls who have experienced challenges and learned to transcend them using their imaginations and creativity. The human spirit is one that rises to the occassion, when given the chance. The stories are touching, funny, provocative, childlike and fantastical. </p>
<p>10 Characters, 10 Dances, 10 Multi-medium Projections</p>
<p>Express the magnitude of what contributors will help you achieve.</p>
<p>The show can happen with your support. Last Import is the culmination of three years of soul-searching and writing the stories of women and girls that I know intimately, the likes of which are rare in these times. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>For the San Francisco production of Last Import, I need to raise 2600 dollars. </p>
<p>Funds cover: travel expenses, costuming, set, space rental, accomodations, stage managemer, PR, and transportation. Any and all funds received will go towards the production.</p>
<p>All contributors will be acknowledged (unless otherwise requested) in the playbill for the show as Angel Investors.</p>
<p>For donations of 500 dollars or more, contributors receive a signed original painting and are provided with a producer credit in the play. My art has been featured at galleries in New York City (Cafe Grumpy Art Show, Theater for the New City Art Show, Dock Studios (Bushwick), and in Vermont in Spring 2013). </p>
</div>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Yes, you can! Donated supplies, transportation, mileage for travel, gift certificates, and any other suggestions are welcome. This production is timely and meaningful and has come to fruition because of the support of people like you. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Nicole Gilbertson. I am a senior at Columbia College Chicago where I study Dance. In my final semester of college, I am in the process of making my final work and Choreogrpahic Project called, <em>Chronomentrophobia.</em></p>
<p><em>Chronomentrophobia </em>takes the audience on a surreal experience led by extraterrestrial creatures within their last minutes of life. The piece studies the meaning of the word Chronomentrophobia: the fear of time.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The choreography is finished, the score is set, the lights are designed...and now we need costumes. This project needs $300 in total for the creation of these costumes. This includes the basics, accesories, and fabrics.</p>
<p>All who help this project will receive a thank you card!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will make this piece a reality. Without these costumes, the dancers cannot externally potray their characters, nor will they feel expressive in their own ""skin."" Alonside choreography, score, lights, and performance, this work cannot be completed without these costumes.</p>

</h3>
<p><i>Circle Mirror Transformation </i>is presented by WAVE Productions.</p>
<p>WAVE is a self-supporting, not-for-profit student theatre company operating primarily on Northwestern University's Evanston Campus. WAVE exists to share the stories of the past and present in order to open the door to a better future. In addition to having five main stage shows per season, WAVE supports and creates special events that stretch the boundaries of what theatre can be. <br/></p>
<p><i>Circle
Mirror Transformation</i>, by
the Pulitzer prize-winning Annie Baker, takes us through a summer Creative
Drama class in a Vermont town. It is a petri dish of human life, exploring loneliness
and togetherness, awkwardness and freedom, pain and reconciliation, the things
we hold in, and what happens when we let them out. Our aesthetic is finding
beauty in simplicity. </p>
</div> <div> <h3>Join Our Circle <br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<p>As with all productions, <i>Circle Mirror Transformation </i>presents
unique challenges. Because the show is realistic, it is very important to us

<h3>Transform Our World<br/>
</h3> <p></p>Together, we can bring this riveting story to life and reach the Northwestern and Evanston communities. This is a story about a group of lost, isolated souls coming together to share their lives with each other. About finding hope and love in the most unexpected of places. About taking risks in order to grow as human beings. We are proud to share this story as learners and givers in a world where magic happens everyday. <br/>
</div></div>","The Story 

Circle Mirror Transformation is presented by WAVE Productions.
WAVE is a self-supporting, not-for-profit student theatre company operating primarily on Northwestern University's Evanston Campus. WAVE exists to share the stories of the past and present in order to open the door to a better future. In addition to having five main stage shows per season, WAVE supports and creates special events that stretch the boundaries of what theatre can be. 
Circle
Mirror Transformation, by
the Pulitzer prize-winning Annie Baker, takes us through a summer Creative
Drama class in a Vermont town. It is a petri dish of human life, exploring loneliness
and togetherness, awkwardness and freedom, pain and reconciliation, the things
we hold in, and what happens when we let them out. Our aesthetic is finding
beauty in simplicity. 
  Join Our Circle 
 
As with all productions, Circle Mirror Transformation presents
unique challenges. Because the show is realistic, it is very important to us
that the world we create looks authentic. This means we have to take extra care
in constructing the set so that it is polished and does not look theatrical. Your donations will help with the purchase and rental of different items 
so that the director's and designers' vision can be fully realized into a
 high quality production that takes place in the Louis Room, one of Northwestern's performance spaces. Some of our costs include:

Costumes (six different characters; wardrobe changes for each week of the show's plot line) 

Purchasing mirrors and a dance bar to transform our space into a dance studio

Rental of lighting and sound equipment 
Printing materials for advertising throughout Evanston and Chicago so that we can reach a wide, diverse audience

<p>Daisy Productions is a Toronto-based theatre company whose goal is to provide a stage (and audience!) for up-and-coming performers and writers. <br/></p>
<p>Daisy Productions was founded in the summer of 2010 in Waterloo, Ontario, by model and actress Kelly Taylor, largely due to the lack of opportunities in Waterloo Region for new playwrights to showcase their work. The company opened with the original comedy ""The Other Side of the Rhyme"" written by local playwright and actress Alyssa Wright. ""Rhyme"" went up at Kitchener-Waterloo Little Theatre, a 70-seat house, and nearly sold out every performance. With the success in Waterloo, Daisy Productions took the show to Toronto in the winter of 2011, reaching a bigger stage and audience with a 200-seat venue in North York. <br/></p>
<p>After relocating to Toronto, Daisy Productions has put on several more productions including the cabaret-style variety night ""Dare to Dream"" at the Black Swan Tavern, which featured actors performing their favourite songs from various musicals, as well as original comedy sketches by Waterloo and Toronto writers. </p></span></span><blockquote><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><p>""<i>You find yourself smitten with how game [to perform] the company is</i>"" - Film Army review of Dare to Dream</p></span></span></blockquote><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><p>Our mandate is to continue to foster new writing and performing talent, and we would love your support to help discover and nurture these talented young adults.

<h3>What's ""Threesome"" About?<br/>
</h3>
<p>""Threesome"" features three one-act plays by Canadian talent:</p></span><ul>
<li>""Writer's Block"" by Eleanor Kelly<br/>
</li>
<li>""The Structure of my Man"" by John MacDougall</li>
<li>""Donny's Day"" by David Findley</li>
</ul>
<p>After reviewing a whole pile of script submissions, these three were selected for their strong characterizations and memorable story-lines. Oh, and for their gut-wrenchingly hilarious moments. We believe in the talent of these playwrights and want to introduce people to their work.</p>
<p>More than that, though, ""Threesome"" is also our largest endeavor to date - our largest overall cast, the most time spent in rehearsal, and a more popular and better-accessible theatre space. Overall, a bigger project means a need for a larger stage and of course a proper rehearsal space. Our goal is to raise and make enough money to pay for both as well as ensure that our actors and writers are rewarded for sharing their talents with the audience. A larger venue means a broader spectrum of exposure for these writers and actors who have shown so much talent and such a willingness to give freely in the past. </p>
<p>""Writer's Block"" deals with the trials and tribulations facing writers, and the frustrations of not-quite-fictional characters whose lives hang in the balance.</p>
<p>""The Structure of my Man"" takes a good hard look at the battle of the sexes - what do women really want in a man, and what do men find most attractive in a woman? May the best one win!</p>
<p>""Donny's Day"" is a heartwarming tale about one man's struggle to get his life together, despite the shocking ineptitude and apathy of nearly everyone in his support system around him.</p>
<p>""Threesome"" opens Thursday, January 23rd, 2014, at Unit 102 Theatre (376 Dufferin St) in Toronto.<br/></p>

<h3>How Your Support Will Help<br/>
</h3>
<p>Producing independent theatre in Toronto that breaks even or generates a profit at the end of its run is often challenging at the best of times. By contributing your support to this campaign, you will help the company pay for its rehearsal and performance spaces, leaving more funding to go back to the actors, writers, and toward future productions. </p>
<p>Our rehearsal space will cost approximately $1500, for our four months of rehearsal prior to the show. That is a cost we are paying out before we even sell a single ticket, and is one of the lowest-priced spaces we could find in Toronto.</p>
<p>Our performance venue is another $800+ to rent. We hope that ticket sales will cover this cost and other parts of our budget, but won't know for sure until after the show finishes.</p>
<p>We've budgeted $250 to go into props and costumes. This is a low minimum, and involves begging and borrowing a lot from generous friends. </p>
<p>We are putting approximately $100 into marketing and printing. Again, this is a low amount and we're doing as much through DIY as we can.<br/></p>
<p>We would like to pay each of our talent a minimum of $50 at the end of the run. Actually, we'd like to be able to pay them a lot more than that. However, what we can give as an honorarium will depend on the success of ticket sales and our ability to match our overall budget. Right now, everyone working on the show is doing so on a volunteer basis.<br/></p>

<p>Hello, my name is Daniel ""Danny"" Muñoz. I have been working in theater for over a decade and have worked on many productions ranging from classical plays like Shakespeare to Original plays . I have worked very hard and have gained a lot of experience such as directing, stage managing, designing tech, producing, acting, and playwriting. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This production is very important to me because it will be our last play in our current space, inside The Alexandria in downtown Los Angeles. I have been a member of Company of Angels since 2008, and really have made great friends and a second family with them. This theater company has been around for over 50 years so  I want to celebrate the work Company of Angels has done by creating a wonderful and memorable show and go out with a bang!</p>

Here they meet all kinds of characters who help her a long her journey to discover what Christmas and any holiday is really about. 


I originally wrote this play for a Toy Drive that helped low income families have gifts for Christmas. I wanted to share the idea that weather or not you receive gifts or toys, that our imagination is an amazing gift we all have and the real prize is the friends and family we have. 

Hello, my name is Daniel ""Danny"" Muñoz. I have been working in theater for over a decade and have worked on many productions ranging from classical plays like Shakespeare to Original plays . I have worked very hard and have gained a lot of experience such as directing, stage managing, designing tech, producing, acting, and playwriting. 

This production is very important to me because it will be our last play in our current space, inside The Alexandria in downtown Los Angeles. I have been a member of Company of Angels since 2008, and really have made great friends and a second family with them. This theater company has been around for over 50 years so  I want to celebrate the work Company of Angels has done by creating a wonderful and memorable show and go out with a bang!

<p>     The late Shirley Gaines established Seekers of Knowledge in Whiteville North Carolina in 1995. In 1998 the torch was passed  on to Mrs. Gaines's daughter Cynthia Gaines who later decided to bring the program to Boston Massachusetts; with the expansion of the participants and the programs growth, Seekers of Knowledge went from a program to a full non- profit organization. In September, dance teacher and choreographer Amy Constantino will become the director and Seekers of Knowledge will continue to excel as a full dance and arts organization. Located in the Dorchester section of Boston, Seekers of Knowledge has served over 800 girls from the Roxbury, Dorchester, Mattapan, Hype Park, and Roslindale communities. </p>

When attacked by a visiting Laird, Marion takes refuge with these “Gypsies” until King Henry’s Egyptians Act drives them from Scotland.  Forced to marry against her will and thus remain behind, Marion must entrust the Romani and her best friend with her newborn daughter as they wander through Europe.  More than twenty years later, the Romani return in search of Marion and a place to call home only to face a harsher version of the Egyptians Act that divides their camp and threatens their lives. </p>

<h3>Adventure Through Space and Time</h3>
<p><span><span>We're a group of college kids from the University of Florida who want to create the most fantastic Doctor Who based musical the world has ever seen. The fourth annual Whosical, Whosical the Musical: A Game of Time, is stoked as smoke to be showing it's stuff at Swampcon: Total Annihilation on February 7th. The Doctor, the Winchesters, and so many more characters are ready to take the stage by storm. But we need your help to make our show happen</span></span></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3> <p></p>
<span>Whosical the Musical is free to the public, which means our budget doesn't quite reach to the stars. We have the support of SwampCon and the University of Florida Student Government, but set, costumes, and props cost a lot of money. Our current budget of $250 dollars only stretches so far. We want to bring the Doctor and his world to life, and every member of our cast and crew gives everything they can every day. But at the end of that day, we need your help to make this show everything that we know it can be.</span> </div><h3>Goals</h3><div>To reach our potential, we need at least $50. $50 would make us so happy, we could sing. And we will. If this Indiegogo reaches that bare minimum goal, we will release a soundtrack of the show alongside all of our perks. </div><div>
<b>$200</b> - Our show can have playbills! Most of our props last year were made out of cardboard, paint, and the devotion only a college student on coffee can give at three in the morning. Playbills would be a dream come true. And if you contribute at least $5, you will be in that playbill. </div><h2>Update #1</h2><div>We made $200! Those shiny li'l playbills up there? We got em! Your generosity blew us straight out of the water, and landed all of you wonderful contributors in the playbills for the show. But why stop here? This is the little show that could, and we're gonna keep chugging. We've added a couple of extra stretch goals below, cause this train needs tracks. Alright, no more metaphors. I promise.</div><div>
<b>$400</b> - We would make a platform out of wood and our undying appreciation, throw it on the stage, and shout how much we love you all. A platform will elevate our actors so that even the Inuyasha cosplayer way in the back row who came in late because his panel ran long can see our show.</div><div>
<b>$600 </b>- You know what our Doctor doesn't have? A proper trenchcoat. You know what he will have if we reach this goal? The most amazing, incredible, proper trench coat the world has ever seen.</div><h2>Update #2</h2><div>Stunned. As we pull this campaign to a close, all I can say is that we have been completely stunned by everyone's generosity. The outpouring of support from friends, family, and strangers on the internet surpassed anything we expected from this campaign. You allowed us to let our imaginations run wild. You let us think big. Plans we couldn't dream of fulfilling became possible thanks to you. Okay, now I'm starting to tear up a bit. Hold it in, man!</div><div>We accomplished every goal on this page, save for the $1000 goal, which we only missed due to timing and scheduling issues. Thanks to this Indiegogo and a surprisingly effective bake sale, we have playbills, a platform, and a proper trenchcoat for our Doctor. This year's Whosical was made possible thanks to contributers like you. Thank you.</div><div>
<b>$1000 -</b> This is a big one. The day of the show is the first day that we get to see the stage, use the equipment, and test out the play in that space. Because that is one big space. and it costs a TON of money to rent out. Like, so much money. But if we get so much money, say, $1000, then we can use the stage before hand! We can have time to practice on that stage and learn how to use that tech a couple days before, and that will help our show out tremendously. If we reach this stretch goal, we will rent out the performance space and the tech (microphones, lights) a day or two before the show so we can have a chance to practice with it.</div> <div> <h3>Our History</h3> <p>We started running this show in 2012. Every year, we write new scripts, audition new actors, and bring our dreams to life. This is the biggest and brightest show we've ever pulled off, and we can't wait to show you what we've been working on since last summer.

<div><b>Synopsis:</b></div>
<div>
<p>Amanda Wingfield is a faded, tragic remnant of Southern gentility who lives in poverty in a dingy St. Louis apartment with her son, Tom, and her daughter, Laura. Amanda strives to give meaning and direction to her life and the lives of her children, though her methods are ineffective and irritating. Tom is driven nearly to distraction by his mother's nagging and seeks escape in alcohol and the world of the movies. Laura also lives in her illusions. She is crippled, and this defect, intensified by her mother's anxiety to see her married, has driven her more and more into herself. The crux of the action comes when Tom invites a young man of his acquaintance to take dinner with the family. Jim, the caller, is a nice ordinary fellow who is at once pounced upon by Amanda as a possible husband for Laura. In spite of her crude and obvious efforts to entrap the young man, he and Laura manage to get along very nicely, and momentarily Laura is lifted out of herself into a new world. But this crashes when, toward the end, Jim explains that he is already engaged. The world of illusion that Amanda and Laura have striven to create in order to make life bearable collapses about them. Tom, too, at the end of his tether, at last leaves home.</p>
<p>A drama of great tenderness, charm and beauty, THE GLASS MENAGERIE is one of the most famous plays of the modern theatre.</p>

parts are performed by members of the btc company, while small roles and ensemble singing are cast amongst our attendees (with musical materials provided, of course). theatre fans enjoy the show, the more adventurous join along, and everyone involved becomes one hell of a cast party.part musical theatre, part drunken singalong. all fun and all together.if you enjoy theatre or silliness or partying as much as we do, you’ll understand what brooklyn theatre club is all about. our audience is part of the show because the songs always sound better when everyone sings along.  our indiegogo and your help will raise the funds needed to produce the first year of programming of brooklyn theatre club and beyond. it will help us acquire the rights to five shows this year and cover the additional expenses needed to build the name and reputation of our budding theatre company.this year's season of brooklyn theatre club programming equals 4 shows plus a halloween fundraiser. theatre rights clock in at about $1000/show. 5 shows over 1 year = $5000our $4000 goal will get us started on this expensive process.next question on your lips might be: why not just go rogue and do the shows without the rights?WELL, we want to see brooklyn theatre club with its name in lights. and like any other legitimate theatre, be it broadway, off-brodaway, or off-off-off-off-broadway-across-the-bridge like us, we need to obtain the rights to these shows so that we can promote as much as possible and and reach the widest audience.show profits will go towards saving for a venue space of our own in brooklyn (our clubhouse!) so that we can produce more shows and a wider range of performance art. we also hope to pay our actors with these profits. unlike some other theatre companies, we will not make our club members pay dues for their participation. instead, we hope to pay our talent for the time and effort they put into their professional performances with the club.from our start with les miserables (a 23rd birthday party)and the mystery of edwin drood (the inspiration)to you’re a good man charlie brown (the test run),our friends and supporters have already responded so well to the idea of brooklyn theatre club. our indiegogo goal will help take this idea out of rooftops and apartments where we have previously performed and instead bring this idea to the masses.  every member of our audience is a member of the club, and in that simple philosophy, we want new friends of all performing backgrounds (even those who only shine in the shower). we want to create an environment where everyone gets the chance to perform - professionals, amateurs, and drunk warblers alike.we don’t want competition or judgment.we don't want member dues.we want to get together with our old and new friends and sing through a show, just like how we were founded.in a borough that changes every day, our goal is to bring something special back to it. we are so passionate about the club and we can’t wait for you to come sing along. BTC4EVZ great thanks,",13.0,0,"1 Campaign

Hello! My name is Daniel Libatique. I am a competitive ballroom dancer specializing in the American Smooth and Rhythm styles at the Open level in both.

Our troupe of actors has been given the opportunity to bring our new show “Landfall” to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and we are looking for support. <br/>         </div>
<div>      Let me tell you a little bit about our theatre troupe: We are a small group of actors that is focused on developing new works from young talent around our city. Our past two shows that we have toured to festivals have involved not only students and graduates from The University of Memphis’ Department of Theatre and Dance, but also students from different high schools in the city. All of our productions are new works that have been cultivated from the nurturing city we are from and to show the stories and storytellers of our community to the rest of the world. Also, we are very committed to our craft and always ready to go the extra mile with every bit of support that we are given. <br/>        </div>
<div>      Next let me tell you about our new show “Landfall”: It is a modern-age fairy-tale about the North Star being tricked out of the sky and stumbling into a family’s life changing them forever. With the use of mask acting coupled with beautiful movement and song we weave a heart-warming story about love, friendship, and how the world needs to work together to survive. This family friendly play uses young actors as well seasoned college graduates to bring a story to life while helping our troupe to learn and grow with every performance. </div>
<div>
<br/>       You can be a part of making this dream of ours to perform in one of the most prestigious festivals in the world happen. We are already working hard to try to raise the funds to take us to the festival but we are in still need of support. Our fundraising goal is fifteen thousand dollars and we are working as hard as we can to make that goal happen.  Every donation matters. </div>

company brings a new group of company members to a physical and emotional piece

<b style=""font-size: 30px; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 38px;"">wha gwaan: a brief history of <i>pomme</i></b><br/>
</div><div>
<b><i><br/></i>
</b><p><i>pomme is french for apple</i> is a play that is written, performed and produced by us - liza paul
and bahia watson. and it’s not about apples - it’s about pum. </p>
<p><i>pum (n): short for pum
pum. west indian for a woman’s private parts. </i></p>
<p>after meeting at a storytelling residency in
2010, we started writing together and developed <i>pomme is french for apple</i>, and have been performing it ever since. we’ve played festivals
across canada, like femfest, the just-for-laughs produced JFL42, the winter at the
young festival and the toronto fringe (best of fringe, patrons’ pick, critics’
pick). we’ve even received a standing ovation at the legendary nuyorican poets’
cafe in new york city. </p>
<p>and now we’ve been invited
to (drumroll, please)... the edinburgh festival fringe!!! it’s the biggest arts
festival in the entire world! it’s almost a month long! thousands of shows and
thousands of performers - including us. amaaaaazing! then we realized how much
is costs... NUFF. which is a lot. which is why we need your help to go to edinburgh and
represent #pumlife. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2><b>ummmmm... what is #pumlife?</b></h2>
<p><i>pomme is french for apple</i> is a fresh, funny, irreverent and distinctly west indian look at
womanhood in all its glory - its perils, its pleasures and all kinda madness in
between. comprised of a series of fast-paced vignettes and original songs, we
play an international cast of outrageous characters - even pums have speaking
roles. all to celebrate ourselves, laugh at ourselves, share ourselves, as
caribbean women, as full, dynamic women, as human beings - this is all
#pumlife. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><b>gotta give it up to get some </b></h2>
<p>so far we've raised almost $30K - not bad,
right? but this festival is crazy expensive: although it's prestigious, it's
not what we'd call a lucrative opportunity, since they don't pay for anything,
and all the prices are in great british pounds.  we need $20K more to make
it happen.</p>
<p>when you give to us, you get not only the
deep satisfaction that comes with doing good deeds and supporting artists who
have worked like donkeys for years, you also get dope stuff. you could be
featured on our gratitude wall, obtain the secret recipe to uncle bunny's
famous rum punch (an ancient jamaican family secret), tickets to pomme's fourth birthday
party (we can't believe it's been nearly four years already!), orrrr get the
chance to have us mix you cocktails and hang out with us. we're lots of fun.
you'll see. </p>
<p>since you have to use paypal for a fixed campaign and we're not so into that, we're going to go with flexible. if we don't reach our goal, we will get to keep whatever we've raised, but indiegogo will keep a higher percentage of whatever we've collected by the time the campaign closes than they would if we hit the mark. you'd still get your perks, though, which is awesome because you deserve them, but it would be kind of sad for us, cuz that $20K goal is the truth - it's what we need to make the whole thing go. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<h2>discovery: people dem love pum </h2>
<p>“funny and liberating... <i>pomme</i> belongs to that bracing wave of candid, liberating and gleefully
gross female humour unleashed by the likes of <i>30 Rock, Girls</i> and <i>Bridesmaids</i>”
- Globe and Mail</p>
<p>“hilarious and fearless” **** - NOW
Magazine</p>
<p>“a real gem... an honest, intelligent and
wildly funny play” ***** - Theatromania</p>
<p>these are some of the lovely things people
have said about <i>pomme. </i>amazing,
right? and it’s all even more amazing because our show is about pums and pums
don't get much fair representation in the media these days. they're either
being used to sell beer, or being waxed to within an inch of their lives, or
they're being abused in yet another weird criminal investigation
series where the women are disproportionately the victims of a plethora of
weird sex crimes, or they're alluded to as holes for men to put their parts
into without any consideration for the human beings they belong to. ew. our
pums have way more interesting stories than that to tell. and that's what we've
been doing with this show. </p>
<p>we've written and produced and performed our
show to critical acclaim for years with no funding from any outside sources.
we've done it for the love and for the audiences who come back and bring their
friends and love the show and ask us to keep bringing it back. and now we have
this huge opportunity to make our mark on the international stage - and we need
help to make it happen.  </p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><b><br/></b></h2>
<h2><b>join the pum revolution</b></h2>
<p>we are doing our best to be the change we
want to see in the world. women are funny, complex, excellent creatures.
but it's a sad truth that women, despite making up over half the world's
population, are woefully under and misrepresented in the media today. our true
voices are not being heard - it is overwhelmingly men who are at the helm of
theatre companies and media conglomerates and film studios and they are the
ones making the decisions about the way we appear to the world at large. we're
not so into that. we love all the strong women who have come before us and made
it possible for us to stand onstage dressed up like giant pums and talk about
the things that matter to us (all in good humour, of course - pums are too
funny not to catch jokes) and we want to follow in their footsteps and honour
the fact that we stand on their shoulders and make room for all the beautiful
brown and red and yellow and black and every colour of girls who have stories
of their own to share. life is way more interesting than the version we're
being sold. we want to remind people that women are smart, funny, creatures,
too. and we want to make people laugh. life is too absurd not to bust a gut about
it. </p>
<br/><h2>the struggle is (too) real </h2>
<p>arts funding is not an easy thing to come
by. we've done really well with the help of our pommunity, and we believe that we can meet our goal with the help of people
like you who believe in the power of the arts for social change and who are
ready for women of colour to have a voice about their bodies, their lives and
their experiences on an international stage.  </p>

$50K is a lot of money, but we think we can get
there. people tell us after almost every show how much it meant to them, how
much they laughed, how much they felt like we'd taken the story of their lives
and put it onstage for them to see it reflected back at them. we took a chance
when we signed up for the festival without the funding to get us there in
place, and we've been hustling hard to get to where we need to be before we go.
they say that fortune favours the bold. hopefully fortune sees this venture as
bold and not plain foolish. otherwise, it’ll be a long, hungry
month. <div>

</div></div>","wha gwaan: a brief history of pomme


pomme is french for apple is a play that is written, performed and produced by us - liza paul
and bahia watson. and it’s not about apples - it’s about pum. 
pum (n): short for pum
pum. west indian for a woman’s private parts. 
after meeting at a storytelling residency in
2010, we started writing together and developed pomme is french for apple, and have been performing it ever since. we’ve played festivals
across canada, like femfest, the just-for-laughs produced JFL42, the winter at the
young festival and the toronto fringe (best of fringe, patrons’ pick, critics’
pick). we’ve even received a standing ovation at the legendary nuyorican poets’
cafe in new york city. 
and now we’ve been invited
to (drumroll, please)... the edinburgh festival fringe!!! it’s the biggest arts
festival in the entire world! it’s almost a month long! thousands of shows and
thousands of performers - including us. amaaaaazing! then we realized how much
is costs... NUFF. which is a lot. which is why we need your help to go to edinburgh and
represent #pumlife. 

ummmmm... what is #pumlife?
pomme is french for apple is a fresh, funny, irreverent and distinctly west indian look at
womanhood in all its glory - its perils, its pleasures and all kinda madness in
between. comprised of a series of fast-paced vignettes and original songs, we
play an international cast of outrageous characters - even pums have speaking
roles. all to celebrate ourselves, laugh at ourselves, share ourselves, as
caribbean women, as full, dynamic women, as human beings - this is all
#pumlife. 



gotta give it up to get some 
so far we've raised almost $30K - not bad,
right? but this festival is crazy expensive: although it's prestigious, it's
not what we'd call a lucrative opportunity, since they don't pay for anything,
and all the prices are in great british pounds.  we need $20K more to make
it happen.
when you give to us, you get not only the
deep satisfaction that comes with doing good deeds and supporting artists who
have worked like donkeys for years, you also get dope stuff. you could be
featured on our gratitude wall, obtain the secret recipe to uncle bunny's
famous rum punch (an ancient jamaican family secret), tickets to pomme's fourth birthday
party (we can't believe it's been nearly four years already!), orrrr get the
chance to have us mix you cocktails and hang out with us. we're lots of fun.
you'll see. 
since you have to use paypal for a fixed campaign and we're not so into that, we're going to go with flexible. if we don't reach our goal, we will get to keep whatever we've raised, but indiegogo will keep a higher percentage of whatever we've collected by the time the campaign closes than they would if we hit the mark. you'd still get your perks, though, which is awesome because you deserve them, but it would be kind of sad for us, cuz that $20K goal is the truth - it's what we need to make the whole thing go. 



discovery: people dem love pum 
“funny and liberating... pomme belongs to that bracing wave of candid, liberating and gleefully
gross female humour unleashed by the likes of 30 Rock, Girls and Bridesmaids”
- Globe and Mail
“hilarious and fearless” **** - NOW
Magazine
“a real gem... an honest, intelligent and
wildly funny play” ***** - Theatromania
these are some of the lovely things people
have said about pomme. amazing,
right? and it’s all even more amazing because our show is about pums and pums
don't get much fair representation in the media these days. they're either
being used to sell beer, or being waxed to within an inch of their lives, or
they're being abused in yet another weird criminal investigation
series where the women are disproportionately the victims of a plethora of
weird sex crimes, or they're alluded to as holes for men to put their parts
into without any consideration for the human beings they belong to. ew. our
pums have way more interesting stories than that to tell. and that's what we've
been doing with this show. 
we've written and produced and performed our
show to critical acclaim for years with no funding from any outside sources.
we've done it for the love and for the audiences who come back and bring their
friends and love the show and ask us to keep bringing it back. and now we have
this huge opportunity to make our mark on the international stage - and we need
help to make it happen.  



join the pum revolution
we are doing our best to be the change we
want to see in the world. women are funny, complex, excellent creatures.
but it's a sad truth that women, despite making up over half the world's
population, are woefully under and misrepresented in the media today. our true
voices are not being heard - it is overwhelmingly men who are at the helm of
theatre companies and media conglomerates and film studios and they are the
ones making the decisions about the way we appear to the world at large. we're
not so into that. we love all the strong women who have come before us and made
it possible for us to stand onstage dressed up like giant pums and talk about
the things that matter to us (all in good humour, of course - pums are too
funny not to catch jokes) and we want to follow in their footsteps and honour
the fact that we stand on their shoulders and make room for all the beautiful
brown and red and yellow and black and every colour of girls who have stories
of their own to share. life is way more interesting than the version we're
being sold. we want to remind people that women are smart, funny, creatures,
too. and we want to make people laugh. life is too absurd not to bust a gut about
it. 
the struggle is (too) real 
arts funding is not an easy thing to come
by. we've done really well with the help of our pommunity, and we believe that we can meet our goal with the help of people
like you who believe in the power of the arts for social change and who are
ready for women of colour to have a voice about their bodies, their lives and
their experiences on an international stage.  

$50K is a lot of money, but we think we can get
there. people tell us after almost every show how much it meant to them, how
much they laughed, how much they felt like we'd taken the story of their lives
and put it onstage for them to see it reflected back at them. we took a chance
when we signed up for the festival without the funding to get us there in
place, and we've been hustling hard to get to where we need to be before we go.
they say that fortune favours the bold. hopefully fortune sees this venture as
bold and not plain foolish. otherwise, it’ll be a long, hungry
month. 

#tightlikemypum 
if money's tight for you right now but you
still want to help, tell all your friends about these two gyals who are trying
to get their pomme across the ocean. facebook, twitter, our website -
share share share! word of mouth and good reviews are what got us this far.
yours can help us keep going. 
thanks so much for taking the time. we appreciate it. nuff.

Now in our sixteenth year, we stay committed to creating a diverse literary and artistic environment for both artists and audience alike.<p></p>
<p>The poetry slam has been a core format of ours since 1998, and we're especially excited about the team that will be representing us at the National Poetry Slam in Oakland this August: Brendan Wolff, Chanel Dupree, Thomas Fucaloro, and Gabriel Ramirez.</p>
<p>NPS 2014: OAKLAND, CA</p>
<p>Taking place from <span>August 5th to 9th</span>, the National Poetry Slam is a magical annual gathering of hundreds of poets from all over the U.S. and Canada, a diverse mix of voices rarely seen at any other national literary festival.</p>
<p>louderARTS has a proud history of representing NYC at NPS since 1998, but we need our community's help to get our wonderfully diverse team of poets all the way to Oakland!</p>
<p>WHAT WE NEED</p>
<p>Getting to Oakland entails NPS registration, travel, and housing for five people (the team + one organizer) for six days. Estimating a cost of $1250 per person, we will need to raise around $5000 to make the magic happen.</p>
<p>WHO WE ARE</p>
<p>louderARTS is a 100% volunteer organization. Ours is a labor of love and service, firmly anchored in our belief in the power of poetry, art and language to shift the conversations in culture. The generosity of our features, poets, artists, sponsors, and community of audience members is what has allowed us to do the work that we do.</p>
<p>All the funds we raise go towards our work and our programs. Our gain is the deep satisfaction derived from the work that we do.</p>
<p>Over the course of the campaign, we'll get to know each of the poets on the team individually, hoping to further inspire you to help us get them to Oakland!</p>

The poetry slam has been a core format of ours since 1998, and we're especially excited about the team that will be representing us at the National Poetry Slam in Oakland this August: Brendan Wolff, Chanel Dupree, Thomas Fucaloro, and Gabriel Ramirez.
NPS 2014: OAKLAND, CA
Taking place from August 5th to 9th, the National Poetry Slam is a magical annual gathering of hundreds of poets from all over the U.S. and Canada, a diverse mix of voices rarely seen at any other national literary festival.
louderARTS has a proud history of representing NYC at NPS since 1998, but we need our community's help to get our wonderfully diverse team of poets all the way to Oakland!
WHAT WE NEED
Getting to Oakland entails NPS registration, travel, and housing for five people (the team + one organizer) for six days. Estimating a cost of $1250 per person, we will need to raise around $5000 to make the magic happen.
WHO WE ARE
louderARTS is a 100% volunteer organization. Ours is a labor of love and service, firmly anchored in our belief in the power of poetry, art and language to shift the conversations in culture. The generosity of our features, poets, artists, sponsors, and community of audience members is what has allowed us to do the work that we do.
All the funds we raise go towards our work and our programs. Our gain is the deep satisfaction derived from the work that we do.
Over the course of the campaign, we'll get to know each of the poets on the team individually, hoping to further inspire you to help us get them to Oakland!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

JWG: Oh, right! The Indiegogo Campaign! We've roped together a fantastic team of actors, designers and other theater makers and are pretty much convinced that this is going to be just the most super-fun-crazy thing we've ever created. But we need your help! 
DM: Tell them about the Bud Light Lime. Don't tell them I spilled it in my left eye.
JWG: Yes, Bud Light Lime -- you know, the taste of 2008? -- Bud Light Lime has actually agreed to sponsor us! Which means there will be free beer for everyone when you come to see the show! 
DM: So we've got the beer covered!
JWG: Right! We've got the beer covered. There will be beer. Plenty of beer. But theater is expensive, after all (THANKS A LOT, OBAMA) and while the beer is as good as provided for by the fine people at Anheuser Busch, there is still a lot more to take into consideration. 
DM: Stipends for performers and our production team!
JWG: Rehearsal space.
DM: Which is stupidly expensive.
JWG: Transportation. Design costs. Insurance.
DM: Money to make those really cool coasters you've been talking about.
JWG: Because postcards have gotten sort of played out. 
DM: Plus you can use them as projectile weapons.
JWG: Lighting Rentals. 
DM: PYEW PYEW PYEW
JWG: Stop throwing coasters at me.
DM: Fine.
JWG: And dumplings. Remember how many dumplings you wrote into the script? That now we have to buy every single night?
DM: I know a great dumpling place.
JWG: I could use a dumpling right now.
DM: You are a dumpling right now.
JWG: YOU ARE.
UM...?
DM: Wait! No! The Indiegogo Campaign!
JWG: Right! Yes! The Indiegogo Campaign! -- So, we've got a fair amount of the budget already raised. 
DM: We do?
JWG: About half.
DM: Really?
JWG: Yes, half. Sort of. I mean, hypothetically. In reality, a donor has promised something of a match donation to us if we can raise 4,500 through crowdfunding.
DM: Oh. So when we say we have half of the budget raised, that's sort of wishful thinking. 
JWG: Right. 
DM: SORT OF LIKE THE WORLD ECONOMY AM I RIGHT?
JWG: ...
DM: ...
JWG: So [turning to face the computer screen] this is where YOU come in.
DM:  All you good people of the internet, with your philanthropic urges and tendencies, and deep, deep pocketbooks.
JWG: Looking for the right outlet through which to fulfill your most generous desires. 
DM: Well look no further.
JWG: No further, I say!
DM: Help make PARTY IN THE USA possible.
JWG: 20 bucks, 30 bucks...
DM: Whatever you can give.
JWG: 5 million bucks.
DM: A buck fifty.
JWG: ONE BILLION DOLLARS.
DM: A buck fifty one. A buck fifty two, even.
JWG: A lifetime supply of dumplings.
DM: Twelve Canadian dollars. Whatever it is, we'd love your help! So give what you can, and then, come July, get yourself to the Incubator to see the supremely trippy work you've supported.
JWG: And when you see the show you can drink all the Bud Light Lime you want!
DM: Exactly.
JWG: Where are those bloody marys?
DM: I DRANK THEM. I DRANK THEM UP.
JWG: ...
DM: ...

<p>Janis
Brenner has often paid tribute to her acclaimed mentors and the artists who’ve inspired
her. Now
92Y asks her to switch direction and present artists whom she has mentored from around the world. Janis met Helena Franzén in 1986 in Stockholm and encouraged her to choreograph. Helena,
an acclaimed artist throughout her native Scandinavia, presents the U.S. premiere of
her solo, ""Trigger Point."" Kun-Yang Lin met Janis in his native Taiwan in the
late ‘80s and later danced in her company for eight years. Now based in
Philadelphia, he shows his solo, ""Moon Dance"" performed by Jennifer Rose. Kyla Barkin and Aaron Selissen
perform a duet from Barkin’s piece, ""Reflexive."" Janis met Kyla at UCLA in
the early ‘90s and she and Selissen are long-time members of the  company.
Lilja Ruriksdottir, the first Icelandic dancer to attend Juilliard (where she first worked with Janis in 2011) presents her dance ""Wait"", with Juilliard dancers John Harnage and Maggie Segale and an original percussion score by Juilliard grad Jan Stoneman. Janis herself contributes the
premiere of ""Where-How-Why Trilogy."" The new dance consists of three solos,
performed by exceptional company members Esme Boyce, Sumaya Jackson, and Janis, which explore questions of
place, relevance and the reasons for continuing on an artistic path. For more information and to purchase tickets, go to: <a href=""http://www.92y.org/Event/FAN-Janis-Brenner-Dancers.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.92y.org/Event/FAN-Janis-Brenner-Dancers</a>. <br/></p>

<p>Janis
premieres ""Where-How-Why Trilogy"", a group of three solos set to music by David
Lang, Joni Mitchell and the electronic music band Tosca. And she revives her
2011 work, ""The Mind-Stuff Variations"", a complex dance with a live commissioned
score by in-demand composer Jerome Begin, inspired by moving spontaneously and simultaneously using
words to describe that movement. As she and the company created the dance, Janis came across work by psychologist William James, written 100 years ago,
about Mind-Stuff Theory and what she read fit perfectly with what she was
trying to do in the studio—to be in the moment while also accessing thought,
memory and sensation. The resulting dance is sometimes witty and often
emotionally fraught. Friday’s performance will also include the excerpt from
Kyla Barkin’s ""Reflexive"", Saturday night’s will include ""Wait"" by Lilja
Ruriksdottir and Sunday matinee will include Helena Franzén’s ""Trigger Point."" For more information and to purchase tickets, go to: <a href=""http://www.92y.org/Event/Janis-Brenner-Dancers.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.92y.org/Event/Janis-Brenner-Dancers</a>. </p>

<p>Due to all of the life experiences I have had, I had the revolutionary idea to tie dance in with community service.  Therefore, I am creating the <strong><em>rePUBLIC of daNCe</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong>so that students can put their mark on the world and experience diversity to enhance one's mind and spirit.  Through a variety of experiences, I have learned that <em>""...you shouldn't go through life with a catcher’s mitt on both hands. You need to be able to throw something back.""</em>  ~Maya Angelou. </p>
<p>The <strong><em>rePUBLIC of daNCe</em></strong> believes in creating access to a comprehensive dance education that provides vital skills to prepare young dancers for collegiate and/or professional careers in dance while simultaneously giving back to the community.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>An Opportunity for Reinvention</strong></p>
<p align=""center"">The <strong><em>rePUBLIC of daNCe</em></strong> is looking for the Opportunity to Reinvent dance studio education, but needs some assistance to become an official 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization so we can start our Brick-and-Mortar Campaign to build us a home, making this dream a reality.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What We Need </span></strong></p>
<p>Federal Nonprofit Filing Fee: $850</p>
<p>Printing: ~$23.58</p>
<p>Faxing: ~$26.06</p>
<p>Lawyer Fee: $100</p>
<p>Grand Total: $999.64</p>
<p>We have already been approved as a nonprofit organization within the state of North Carolina!! The Federal approval is the last step to us becoming a recognized nonprofit organization.</p>
<p>Feel free to check us out on FB, or at republicofdance.org</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The Impact</span></strong></p>
<p align=""center"">This is the biggest obstacle we are facing <strong>right now</strong>.</p>

Due to all of the life experiences I have had, I had the revolutionary idea to tie dance in with community service.  Therefore, I am creating the rePUBLIC of daNCe so that students can put their mark on the world and experience diversity to enhance one's mind and spirit.  Through a variety of experiences, I have learned that ""...you shouldn't go through life with a catcher’s mitt on both hands. You need to be able to throw something back.""  ~Maya Angelou. 
The rePUBLIC of daNCe believes in creating access to a comprehensive dance education that provides vital skills to prepare young dancers for collegiate and/or professional careers in dance while simultaneously giving back to the community.
An Opportunity for Reinvention
The rePUBLIC of daNCe is looking for the Opportunity to Reinvent dance studio education, but needs some assistance to become an official 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization so we can start our Brick-and-Mortar Campaign to build us a home, making this dream a reality.
What We Need 
Federal Nonprofit Filing Fee: $850
Printing: ~$23.58
Faxing: ~$26.06
Lawyer Fee: $100
Grand Total: $999.64
We have already been approved as a nonprofit organization within the state of North Carolina!! The Federal approval is the last step to us becoming a recognized nonprofit organization.
Feel free to check us out on FB, or at republicofdance.org
The Impact
This is the biggest obstacle we are facing right now.

<h3>Why Mime Matters</h3>
<p>Mime -- the technique of physically expressing objects, character, emotion, and storyline -- is most familiar these days in improv comedy, which uses no props.</p>
<p>Its techniques of strongly emotive facial and bodily expression are used in many performance arts, from theater, to stage combat, to dance -- and even song! (Richmond coached the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Civic_Light_Opera"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LA Civic Light Opera</a> company for for many years to enhance their physical expression). </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/938259/files/20141017100058-dd0c-4596-21b4-9dce.jpg?1413565258"" src="""" style=""width: 298.257575757576px; height: 381px;""/></p>A mime's bodily isolations may also be familiar to us through hip-hop, tribal bellydance, and other forms of theatrical dance.<p></p>
<p>But in its pure, strongest form, a mime creates whole worlds -- character, place, emotion, storyline, <b><i>everything</i></b> -- through evocative physical expression. </p>
<p>Its techniques are difficult to learn and can take decades to master.</p>
<p>And <a href=""http://richmondshepard.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Richmond Shepard</a> is the master of this art form in America. </p>
<p>Drawing on over six decades of experience -- having created America's first Mime Troupe back in 1951 (where Lily Tomlin got her start!) -- Richmond begins this show with some anecdotes from his impressive history, then illustrates the body articulation and illusions on which polished, professional mime must be based.</p>

<p>Through this introduction and the succeeding vignettes, which range from comedy to pathos to social commentary (accompanied by fellow mimes Marcus Watson and Carol Tandava Henning, with music and narration by Nick Wolfson), the audience begins to understand the depth, range, and theatrical possibilities that mime is capable of.</p>

<p>2013 is Stone Soup Theatre Project's debut season and we're excited! Please consider giving a little donation to help support a first season that we are proud to announce......</p>
<p>Our first production, <em>Tamer of Horses </em>by William Mastrosimone, will open April 5, 2013 and will be produced at the SENN High School Studio Theatre on Chicago's North-side. With the production we will take on 15 of SENN's Performing Arts students as interns and offer them the opportunity to work with a professional company. We believe<em> </em><em>Tamer of Horses</em> will be a beautiful first step for us by examining youth violence, education, and personal relationships on stage. We will set up a series of talkbacks, one each week of the production, with local community members who deal with the same issues on the North-side that the production touches on. Truly uniting our community with theatre.</p>
<p>Our Education Director, Hannah Gallagher, has another amazing summer of classes for local students lined up. Our Education Department works hand in hand with our Outreach Department to identify students who have a love for the arts but may not have the resources available to experience them. Classes and workshops (like our productions) will cost little to nothing so everyone in our community can have the opportunity to enjoy theatre.</p>
<p>Fall 2013 we will produce a true ""Theatre Project"". Artistic Associate Katie Abascal has started to adapt <em>21; epitome of perseverance</em> to the stage and we are excited to tell the story of Chris Patterson, a former Black P Stone member turned community activist.  Chris is a local North-side community member and his life story is one of courage, pain, hope, fear, and redemption. A former member of a Chicago gang who after serving time in the federal system decided to serve the community he felt he hurt. Chris is a long time friend of Stone Soup; our work with him through ""Cure Violence"" and ""Organization Of the Northeast"" has allowed us to connect with community members though theatre. We hope by telling his story we can help audiences relate to the same people who we have started to work with. We are using local actors, activists, writers, and community members to tell the story of one of our own. </p>
<p> <strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>We need $5 from 100 people. That's all!!!!!!</strong></p>
<p>This will allow us a little more room in our operating budget for the upcoming year. We get the equivalent of your venti salted caramel mocha and you get a little holiday cheer knowing you are giving theatre to the communities of Northeast Chicago. </p>
<p>You could spend</p>
<p>$5- for Starbucks on the way to work</p>
<p>$5- on that extra beer</p>
<p>$5- on the Subway Foot-long that always looks better than it tastes</p>
<p><strong>$5- giving a little joy to yourself and others!!!!!!!!</strong></p>
<p>Any gift (even $1) goes to support the work of Stone Soup Theatre Project in our community. Your little bit of cheer will last year round by giving us the capability to work in our neighborhoods. </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Though $5 may not sound like a lot we know for some it is more than you can afford to give. Please don't worry! You can give a little joy by sharing our work! Let others know about us, encourage your friends and family to check us out, follow our staff blogs, and like us on Facebook. This support goes a long way as we start to make a name for ourselves!</p>

Artistic Associate Katie Abascal has started to adapt 21; epitome of perseverance to the stage and we are excited to tell the story of Chris Patterson, a former Black P Stone member turned community activist.  Chris is a local North-side community member and his life story is one of courage, pain, hope, fear, and redemption. A former member of a Chicago gang who after serving time in the federal system decided to serve the community he felt he hurt. Chris is a long time friend of Stone Soup; our work with him through ""Cure Violence"" and ""Organization Of the Northeast"" has allowed us to connect with community members though theatre. We hope by telling his story we can help audiences relate to the same people who we have started to work with. We are using local actors, activists, writers, and community members to tell the story of one of our own. 
  
We need $5 from 100 people. That's all!!!!!!
This will allow us a little more room in our operating budget for the upcoming year. We get the equivalent of your venti salted caramel mocha and you get a little holiday cheer knowing you are giving theatre to the communities of Northeast Chicago. 
You could spend
$5- for Starbucks on the way to work
$5- on that extra beer
$5- on the Subway Foot-long that always looks better than it tastes
$5- giving a little joy to yourself and others!!!!!!!!
Any gift (even $1) goes to support the work of Stone Soup Theatre Project in our community. Your little bit of cheer will last year round by giving us the capability to work in our neighborhoods. 
Other Ways You Can Help
Though $5 may not sound like a lot we know for some it is more than you can afford to give. Please don't worry! You can give a little joy by sharing our work! Let others know about us, encourage your friends and family to check us out, follow our staff blogs, and like us on Facebook. This support goes a long way as we start to make a name for ourselves!",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<h3>CARMEN ELEKTRA: Opera Underground</h3>
<div>We are a young collective of musicians with a keen interest in theatre, modern opera, and clubbing. We believe that opera can shake off it's aesthetic trappings by embracing popular culture and rejecting cumbersome traditions. To try and prove this, we've been producing 'opera club nights' for the last three years, presenting short, modern and accessible works in unconventional venues amidst DJ sets and multimedia installations, and we want to bring our event concept to the London scene.</div>

<h3>Coleen's Theatre Practice, attending Ecole Jacques Lecoq</h3>
<p>In February I walked with Michael Ondaatje along Queen Street West while the snow fell on our eyelashes.</p>
<p>He asked me: ""Do you consider yourself a writer?""  I looked at this great Canadian writer, my eyes aglow, ""Yes, yes I do""  I said:  ""My first impulse has always been to write"".  There was a deep silence as we continued to walk East.  I was alight inside.</p>
<p>So this is my hope, to work towards writing for the stage in a new way by attending a great theatre school in Paris, France.  Here is my letter, my plea, my hope, my joy, and of course my burden, which is: the money I must gain in order to make this all happen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Dear friends and those who believe in the Arts in this country,</strong></p>
<p>I am Coleen Shirin MacPherson.  I am Parsi-Irish, Canadian.  I am a theatre creator (Actor, Director, Playwright) and poet.  I have worked in Toronto for over five years,  creating work with diverse companies like TheatreRUN, Why Not Theatre, Necessary Angel Theatre, Theatre Smith-Gilmour, Theatre Local, Jumblies Theatre, The Children's Peace Theatre and MT Space in Kitchener.  I have formed The Pocketology Collective with Rachel Ellison and created ""spontaneous moments between strangers"".  I write plays, produce readings, teach children playwriting, act and direct. Most recently I mentored with Canada's renowned theatre director, Daniel Brooks and toured to Shangai's Contemporary Theater Festival with TheatreRUN.  I was on CBC's <em>Here and Now</em> with a short documentary on Pocketology, and a play I co-translated with Adam Paolozza will be published in a book on Contemporary Theatre Anthology in Rome.  I am currently compiling all of my poetry into a book and writing a new play, <em>The Selfsame Hour.  </em>Most recently I performed in <em>Artaud:  Un Portrait en Decomposition</em> at Summerworks Festival with TheatreRUN.</p>
<p>Within this momentum of my career, I find that I need to find calm and go deeper into my practice to truly find what it is I can contribute.  I know that after attending Ecole Jacques Lecoq in Paris, my work will become richer, and I hope to bring this strength and knowledge to the future work I will do in Toronto.  I know that this process of going further into my practice will benefit the public and my future collaborators immensely (that is the hope!)</p>
<p>I am asking for support in my endeavour to attend the school.  Not only will I be able to create the work I am dreaming of making, but I will also be able to mentor children and youth in a more wholistic way.  I have worked with 100s of children across Ontario this year, and I know with further knowledge I can enrich these kids' lives and help to develop a new generation of theatre makers and theatre goers.</p>
<p>Without the funding I was hoping to get from the Canada Council for the Arts, my stay in France and attending the school will be financially precarious. There is the flight, the rent, the cost of living and then tuition.  All of these costs add up, and I hope that I can gain a little extra from you in order to make this less difficult.</p>
<p>The support would not only be going to my education at Ecole Jacques Lecoq, but it will also be an investment in the future of Canadian Theatre and Community Arts in Toronto.  My work spans from Directing, Acting, Playwriting to art installations and community arts projects.  I hope you will consider this a worthwhile investment, and I promise to repay this kindness in the form of my art in the future!  In addition, I have strong connections with the next generation of theatre artists in Toronto, and am beginning to form a theatre company under the name Open Heart Surgery Theatre.  My goal is to return to Canada with new energy and knowledge and develop this company, which will have three branches of creative work:  theatre (original), installation/Media work (sound installations to video projects to relational art happenings) and film work (with theatrical exploration).  I am excited in theatre that transcends space and time.  A lot of my ideas are new, they need time to grow, the seeds are there, but the deeper insight needs to be found.  This is why I am attending the school, and so, I hope you will help in any way to make this a little easier for me.</p>
<p><em><strong>The School</strong></em></p>
<div class=""ff8"">
<span class=""a"">Jacques Lecoq </span><span class=""a"">founded l’École Internationale de Théâtre Jacques Lecoq</span><span class=""a"">i n 1956, developing teaching methods that have inspired numerous </span><span class=""a"">practitioners of theatre, in which gesture is at the basis of the performance.</span>
</div>
<p>It is a school that looks at life, movement and the different areas of theatre (tragedy, comedy, bouffon, clown, burlesque).  You are in contact with other theatre makers from all over the world, and are brought into an interrogation with yourself, as to what you want to say, and what kind of theatre you want to make.   What kind of artist can I be in the times we live in today?  How can I serve the public better?  what kind of work is important and essential to our lives? These are questions that are swirling in my head that I hope to find a glimmer of an answer.</p>
<p><em><strong>What Other Theatre Artists Say about Coleen:</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong> </strong></em></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>Coleen's desire to study at L'Ecole Jacques Lecoq puts her in a growing group of Canadian Theatre Artists who are searching for a new, unique theatre of creation that is physical and human: a training that explores the source of theatre creation.  I attended this school in the late 70s and it changed my life as a theatre maker and as a person.  The work I have been doing for the past 30 years in Canada grew from my time at the school, studying with Lecoq.  </em></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>(Dean Gilmour, Co-Artistic Director of Theatre Smith-Gilmour)</em></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Coleen is at a unique position in her development as a professional artist. She has been working professionally as a writer and performer for some years now and is discovering that her true calling is as a theatre creator. What I mean by this is that what she has to offer to the future of Canadian theatre are not just her skills as a writer/poet (which are prodigious), nor her skills as a perfumer and director. She has a vision of a theatre <em>to be:</em> a theatre of the future. She is hungry to create, to explore hitherto unknown theatrical territory. To achieve this she needs unique training. Training that will help her deepen her technical skills as a writer and performer and help her articulate exactly what she has to say as an artist. Lecoq is the perfect place for this.  </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>(Adam Paolozza, Artistic Director of TheatreRUN Canada)</em></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em> </em></p>
<p><strong>Funding</strong></p>
<p>I need to raise at least $3700 in order to fulfill the gap from the funding I was hoping to get from The Canada Council for the Arts.  The money will be going directly to tuition and the plane fare required to get to France.  You will be directly investing in an important step in my development as an artist in this country.  I hope that you consider giving something to this campaign.</p>
<p>There are four categories for donations, let me tell you about the perks:</p>
<p><em><strong>Great Donor:</strong> </em> A donation of $25 will go a long way believe me.  To send my appreciation, you will receive a personalized card and an i-owe-you to future projects in Toronto.</p>
<p><em><strong>Really Really Great Donor: </strong> </em>A Donation of $50 you will receive a personalized card and an i-owe-you to future projects &amp; a surprise gift card to a series of stores (Starbucks, Home Sense, Home Hardware etc.)</p>
<p>COURSE:  A systematic introduction to the theory and practice of Yoga for beginners or for anyone looking to renew their practice. Step by step approach for developing strength, flexibility, good breathing habits, concentration and relaxation.</p>
<p>The course introduces the <a href=""http://www.sivananda.org/toronto/about-yoga-centre/teachings.html#fivepoints"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">5 Points of Yoga</a>, 12 basic yoga postures (Asanas), Breathing exercises (Pranayama), Relaxation exercises, Introduction to proper diet, Introduction to positive thinking and meditation. A four-week course meeting twice a week.</p>
<p>(Value over $200)</p>

So this is my hope, to work towards writing for the stage in a new way by attending a great theatre school in Paris, France.  Here is my letter, my plea, my hope, my joy, and of course my burden, which is: the money I must gain in order to make this all happen.
 
Dear friends and those who believe in the Arts in this country,
I am Coleen Shirin MacPherson.  I am Parsi-Irish, Canadian.  I am a theatre creator (Actor, Director, Playwright) and poet.  I have worked in Toronto for over five years,  creating work with diverse companies like TheatreRUN, Why Not Theatre, Necessary Angel Theatre, Theatre Smith-Gilmour, Theatre Local, Jumblies Theatre, The Children's Peace Theatre and MT Space in Kitchener.  I have formed The Pocketology Collective with Rachel Ellison and created ""spontaneous moments between strangers"".  I write plays, produce readings, teach children playwriting, act and direct. Most recently I mentored with Canada's renowned theatre director, Daniel Brooks and toured to Shangai's Contemporary Theater Festival with TheatreRUN.  I was on CBC's Here and Now with a short documentary on Pocketology, and a play I co-translated with Adam Paolozza will be published in a book on Contemporary Theatre Anthology in Rome.  I am currently compiling all of my poetry into a book and writing a new play, The Selfsame Hour.  Most recently I performed in Artaud:  Un Portrait en Decomposition at Summerworks Festival with TheatreRUN.
Within this momentum of my career, I find that I need to find calm and go deeper into my practice to truly find what it is I can contribute.  I know that after attending Ecole Jacques Lecoq in Paris, my work will become richer, and I hope to bring this strength and knowledge to the future work I will do in Toronto.  I know that this process of going further into my practice will benefit the public and my future collaborators immensely (that is the hope!)
I am asking for support in my endeavour to attend the school.  Not only will I be able to create the work I am dreaming of making, but I will also be able to mentor children and youth in a more wholistic way.  I have worked with 100s of children across Ontario this year, and I know with further knowledge I can enrich these kids' lives and help to develop a new generation of theatre makers and theatre goers.
Without the funding I was hoping to get from the Canada Council for the Arts, my stay in France and attending the school will be financially precarious. There is the flight, the rent, the cost of living and then tuition.  All of these costs add up, and I hope that I can gain a little extra from you in order to make this less difficult.
The support would not only be going to my education at Ecole Jacques Lecoq, but it will also be an investment in the future of Canadian Theatre and Community Arts in Toronto.  My work spans from Directing, Acting, Playwriting to art installations and community arts projects.  I hope you will consider this a worthwhile investment, and I promise to repay this kindness in the form of my art in the future!  In addition, I have strong connections with the next generation of theatre artists in Toronto, and am beginning to form a theatre company under the name Open Heart Surgery Theatre.  My goal is to return to Canada with new energy and knowledge and develop this company, which will have three branches of creative work:  theatre (original), installation/Media work (sound installations to video projects to relational art happenings) and film work (with theatrical exploration).  I am excited in theatre that transcends space and time.  A lot of my ideas are new, they need time to grow, the seeds are there, but the deeper insight needs to be found.  This is why I am attending the school, and so, I hope you will help in any way to make this a little easier for me.
The School

Jacques Lecoq founded l’École Internationale de Théâtre Jacques Lecoqi n 1956, developing teaching methods that have inspired numerous practitioners of theatre, in which gesture is at the basis of the performance.

It is a school that looks at life, movement and the different areas of theatre (tragedy, comedy, bouffon, clown, burlesque).  You are in contact with other theatre makers from all over the world, and are brought into an interrogation with yourself, as to what you want to say, and what kind of theatre you want to make.   What kind of artist can I be in the times we live in today?  How can I serve the public better?  what kind of work is important and essential to our lives? These are questions that are swirling in my head that I hope to find a glimmer of an answer.
What Other Theatre Artists Say about Coleen:
 
Coleen's desire to study at L'Ecole Jacques Lecoq puts her in a growing group of Canadian Theatre Artists who are searching for a new, unique theatre of creation that is physical and human: a training that explores the source of theatre creation.  I attended this school in the late 70s and it changed my life as a theatre maker and as a person.  The work I have been doing for the past 30 years in Canada grew from my time at the school, studying with Lecoq.  
(Dean Gilmour, Co-Artistic Director of Theatre Smith-Gilmour)
Coleen is at a unique position in her development as a professional artist. She has been working professionally as a writer and performer for some years now and is discovering that her true calling is as a theatre creator. What I mean by this is that what she has to offer to the future of Canadian theatre are not just her skills as a writer/poet (which are prodigious), nor her skills as a perfumer and director. She has a vision of a theatre to be: a theatre of the future. She is hungry to create, to explore hitherto unknown theatrical territory. To achieve this she needs unique training. Training that will help her deepen her technical skills as a writer and performer and help her articulate exactly what she has to say as an artist. Lecoq is the perfect place for this.  
(Adam Paolozza, Artistic Director of TheatreRUN Canada)
 
Funding
I need to raise at least $3700 in order to fulfill the gap from the funding I was hoping to get from The Canada Council for the Arts.  The money will be going directly to tuition and the plane fare required to get to France.  You will be directly investing in an important step in my development as an artist in this country.  I hope that you consider giving something to this campaign.
There are four categories for donations, let me tell you about the perks:
Great Donor:  A donation of $25 will go a long way believe me.  To send my appreciation, you will receive a personalized card and an i-owe-you to future projects in Toronto.
Really Really Great Donor:  A Donation of $50 you will receive a personalized card and an i-owe-you to future projects & a surprise gift card to a series of stores (Starbucks, Home Sense, Home Hardware etc.)
COURSE:  A systematic introduction to the theory and practice of Yoga for beginners or for anyone looking to renew their practice. Step by step approach for developing strength, flexibility, good breathing habits, concentration and relaxation.
The course introduces the 5 Points of Yoga, 12 basic yoga postures (Asanas), Breathing exercises (Pranayama), Relaxation exercises, Introduction to proper diet, Introduction to positive thinking and meditation. A four-week course meeting twice a week.
(Value over $200)
A Donor Beyond Words:  A Donation of $1000 you will get a meal at Enoteca Sociale, a wine bar on Dundas West that has been voted one of the top restaurants in Canada ($100 value).  1288 Dundas Street West, Toronto, Ontario.  If you do not live in Toronto, you will receive a surprise gift in the mail.

I have been performing for over 10 years and worked with companies such as The Invisible Circus, The Wonderclub, Arcadia, Ratupadrainpipe, InService Productions and other independent theatre makers.

Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative genetic disorder that affects muscle coordination and leads to cognitive decline and dementia.

As the disease advances, uncoordinated, jerky body movements become more apparent, along with a decline in mental abilities and behavioural and psychiatric problems. Physical abilities are gradually impeded until coordinated movement becomes very difficult. Mental abilities generally decline into dementia.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p></p><p>There are some stories that define a generation. Of course, one of them is the flight of Balloon Boy. Or at least, that’s what it seemed like at the time. For over an hour, America sat by their TV’s and watched the 50 mile flight of a notable silver weather balloon across the mountaintops of Colorado. Why? Because a Fort Collins father had told the press that his six-year-old son was trapped in the home-made, mylar contraption, leading the press into a frenzy that took over the airwaves. Once the Balloon landed and it was discovered that the young boy was in fact not in it, but hiding in a cardboard box in the family’s attic, the Balloon Boy and his family became instant celebrities, until young Falcon admitted on Larry King Live that it was all a hoax, or more famously, “You guys said we did this for the show”.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When this story occurred almost six years ago, I was only in seventh grade. Still, I was moved by it’s over the top twists and turns and began writing the first draft of “Balloon Boy: The Musical”. Looking back, that first draft was rough. It overflowed with a seventh grade mentality and sense of humor, but I discovered that this show which I felt incredibly passionate about then, and even more passionate about now, had the potential to take me and this story on an incredible journey. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The past six years have been very exciting for Balloon Boy: In 2011, a workshop was held at the Kraine Theatre, and in 2014 it won the Thespian Musicalworks Award and was presented at the International Thespian Festival in Lincoln, Nebraska. Following this, it received a much publicized world premiere at Monarch High School in Louisville, Colorado, only a few miles away from where the actual event took place. Of course, the show itself has also changed dramatically in the past few years. What started as a light hearted romp with a middle school feel to it, has become a quirky, over the top, irreverent, satirical, and at times poignant look at the American media system and the idea of the modern American family. It has been alot of hard work turning the show into what it is today, but it has been overwhelmingly worth it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This brings me to the next step for Balloon Boy. The show has been chosen as an official selection of the 2015 New York Musical Theatre Festival, and will be presented as a staged reading this July 7th and 11th. Also exciting is that at 17, I am officially the youngest writer to ever be accepted into this prestigious festival. I am humbled, overjoyed and extremely grateful for this opportunity. However, a balloon needs helium to fly, so I need YOUR help to make Balloon Boy: The Musical New York’s next great musical comedy.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>ABOUT NYMF</b></p>
<p>The New York Musical Theatre Festival nurtures the creation, production, and public presentation of stylistically, thematically, and culturally diverse new musicals to ensure the future vitality of musical theatre.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NYMF is the biggest festival in the world for musicals. Since it’s inception in 2004, it has been the birthplace of three Broadway shows, Next To Normal, title of show, and Chaplin, and 25 off-broadway shows, including this year’s Clinton: The Musical and Altar Boyz. To be in the company of these amazing musicals in absolute honor, and to know that Balloon Boy could fly farther is a dream come true. Balloon Boy’s reading will be staged in an off-broadway theatre, along with many other shows spread out across July, with a professional cast and crew, all thanks to help from NYMF.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT BALLOON BOY: THE MUSICAL</b></p>
<p>Balloon Boy is irreverent, over the top, quirky and above all else, hilarious. I knew that once it was discovered that this event was all a hoax, a musical comedy needed to be written for two reasons. The first, it was clear that this story was presented in such a dramatic context, it sang. Secondly, I saw the overwhelming anger that the story’s climax brought to the country, and I knew the only way that we could get past that, was to laugh. I think that laughter is the best prescription for frustration it today’s day and age, and if we could laugh at how a family tried to fly to the spotlight and how we all helped them do it, then perhaps it wouldn’t be as frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, Balloon Boy also imagines what went on behind this story and how it affected the family at it’s center. While the musical is certainly not for what the Heene family did, it explores why what happened happened, and how the spotlight can affect a scheming father, a devoted wife and a confused child.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Balloon Boy: The Musical has also been reset to take place in the present, as due to it’s themes of instant fame and viral celebrity, it seemed only fitting that the story could have happened now. In doing this, the characters, songs and scenes are constantly updated with the most recent pop culture characters so that the musical, in an SNL-esque fashion can stay up to date and therefore feel more satirically poignant.</p>
<p>So, what celebrities can you expect to see in the latest production? You’ll just have to come to find out.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>WHY I NEED YOUR HELP</b></p>
<p>As I’ve said before, I am insanely passionate about my musical, and I only want the best for it. So, I need the best help I can get. This includes my getting a director, musical director, stage manager and a cast of ten professional performers. In donating, not only will you receive some awesome items to prove that you were a part of the production of this ground-breaking new musical, but you will allow me to showcase Balloon Boy in the way I always dreamed it should be, and in the way that you as an audience deserve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now is the time to fly. And I hope that you will be able to join me and Balloon Boy: The Musical in flight.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/billy-recce/sets/balloon-boy-the-musical-demos"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://soundcloud.com/billy-recce/sets/balloon...</a><br/></div>","There are some stories that define a generation.

Once the Balloon landed and it was discovered that the young boy was in fact not in it, but hiding in a cardboard box in the family’s attic, the Balloon Boy and his family became instant celebrities, until young Falcon admitted on Larry King Live that it was all a hoax, or more famously, “You guys said we did this for the show”.

When this story occurred almost six years ago, I was only in seventh grade. Still, I was moved by it’s over the top twists and turns and began writing the first draft of “Balloon Boy: The Musical”. Looking back, that first draft was rough. It overflowed with a seventh grade mentality and sense of humor, but I discovered that this show which I felt incredibly passionate about then, and even more passionate about now, had the potential to take me and this story on an incredible journey. 

The past six years have been very exciting for Balloon Boy: In 2011, a workshop was held at the Kraine Theatre, and in 2014 it won the Thespian Musicalworks Award and was presented at the International Thespian Festival in Lincoln, Nebraska. Following this, it received a much publicized world premiere at Monarch High School in Louisville, Colorado, only a few miles away from where the actual event took place. Of course, the show itself has also changed dramatically in the past few years. What started as a light hearted romp with a middle school feel to it, has become a quirky, over the top, irreverent, satirical, and at times poignant look at the American media system and the idea of the modern American family. It has been alot of hard work turning the show into what it is today, but it has been overwhelmingly worth it.

This brings me to the next step for Balloon Boy. The show has been chosen as an official selection of the 2015 New York Musical Theatre Festival, and will be presented as a staged reading this July 7th and 11th. Also exciting is that at 17, I am officially the youngest writer to ever be accepted into this prestigious festival. I am humbled, overjoyed and extremely grateful for this opportunity. However, a balloon needs helium to fly, so I need YOUR help to make Balloon Boy: The Musical New York’s next great musical comedy.

ABOUT NYMF
The New York Musical Theatre Festival nurtures the creation, production, and public presentation of stylistically, thematically, and culturally diverse new musicals to ensure the future vitality of musical theatre.

NYMF is the biggest festival in the world for musicals. Since it’s inception in 2004, it has been the birthplace of three Broadway shows, Next To Normal, title of show, and Chaplin, and 25 off-broadway shows, including this year’s Clinton: The Musical and Altar Boyz. To be in the company of these amazing musicals in absolute honor, and to know that Balloon Boy could fly farther is a dream come true. Balloon Boy’s reading will be staged in an off-broadway theatre, along with many other shows spread out across July, with a professional cast and crew, all thanks to help from NYMF.

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT BALLOON BOY: THE MUSICAL
Balloon Boy is irreverent, over the top, quirky and above all else, hilarious. I knew that once it was discovered that this event was all a hoax, a musical comedy needed to be written for two reasons. The first, it was clear that this story was presented in such a dramatic context, it sang. Secondly, I saw the overwhelming anger that the story’s climax brought to the country, and I knew the only way that we could get past that, was to laugh. I think that laughter is the best prescription for frustration it today’s day and age, and if we could laugh at how a family tried to fly to the spotlight and how we all helped them do it, then perhaps it wouldn’t be as frustrating.

That being said, Balloon Boy also imagines what went on behind this story and how it affected the family at it’s center. While the musical is certainly not for what the Heene family did, it explores why what happened happened, and how the spotlight can affect a scheming father, a devoted wife and a confused child.

Balloon Boy: The Musical has also been reset to take place in the present, as due to it’s themes of instant fame and viral celebrity, it seemed only fitting that the story could have happened now. In doing this, the characters, songs and scenes are constantly updated with the most recent pop culture characters so that the musical, in an SNL-esque fashion can stay up to date and therefore feel more satirically poignant.
So, what celebrities can you expect to see in the latest production? You’ll just have to come to find out.

WHY I NEED YOUR HELP
As I’ve said before, I am insanely passionate about my musical, and I only want the best for it. So, I need the best help I can get. This includes my getting a director, musical director, stage manager and a cast of ten professional performers. In donating, not only will you receive some awesome items to prove that you were a part of the production of this ground-breaking new musical, but you will allow me to showcase Balloon Boy in the way I always dreamed it should be, and in the way that you as an audience deserve.

Now is the time to fly. And I hope that you will be able to join me and Balloon Boy: The Musical in flight.https://soundcloud.com/billy-recce/sets/balloon...",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>""Directing Thomas Kilroy's adaptation of Ibsen's Ghosts is one of the most exciting experiences I've had in years.  His play amounts to more than a rethinking of the Ibsen play.   It's a whole new play.  A play about Ireland, a play about the discovery by women in Ireland of their own strength in the 1980s, about AIDS, about Catholicism, about the pain and the chaos and, yes, sometimes even the crazy dark humor that arises from the collision of all those things.  It's beautifully written.  And the cast of this production is astonishing and moving.  I would be thrilled to have it up again so that more people can see it.""  Austin Pendleton</p>

<p>Yokko started creating “Butoh Medea” last March,
adapting the mythological Medea, and Euripides' tragic dramatization of her story,
using the Japanese dance form of Butoh. She started working with
co-choreographer Jordan Rosin, costume designer Deepsikha Chaterjee, and
lighting designer Derek Van Heel for a workshop of the show in May, 2014.
After the first dance workshop, she started working with playwright Sean
Michael Welch, who finalized the adaptation. Shortly after that Ren Gyo Soh
began editing the play's soundscape and working with director Brian Rhinehart
to blend dance and text. </p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FbhRwTVHpEd0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DbhRwTVHpEd0&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FbhRwTVHpEd0%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We as a team believe this piece is important as a new form of dramatic art,
and needs to be seen by a wider audience, so we decided to bring the show to The
Edinburgh Festival this summer. This inter-cultural, collaborative
creation that was born in a basement in New York City will now take the world
stage!! </p>

</div>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The awards we received last fall were a huge
encouragement for us to keep doing what we are doing. People may know the story
of Medea, and may have seen other Medeas onstage, but no one has ever seen a <i>Butoh</i></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> Medea. Sharing the form of Butoh
and Ren Gyo Soh's mission is the key to this project. Your donation will
support not only our dream, but will also encourage anyone who is interested in
Butoh and dance/theatre in general.</span></p>
<div>
<h3></h3>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b>Yokko's Pledge</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>It is a huge financial and professional risk to take a
show to another country, and this festival will be very challenging to me as a
performer.  The festival will include 21 shows in 3 weeks—nearly one show
everyday. So, every time I perform, I will be drenched in sweat; I will be
mentally, physically, emotionally and spiritually exhausted, but I vow to give
every ounce of my being to my audience every day. That is my pledge.</p>
<p></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p></p>
<p>Please spread the word as much as possible, and help us make this show happen!! </p>

We as a team believe this piece is important as a new form of dramatic art,
and needs to be seen by a wider audience, so we decided to bring the show to The
Edinburgh Festival this summer. This inter-cultural, collaborative
creation that was born in a basement in New York City will now take the world
stage!! 
But, to realize this dream, we need your help! Your TAX-FREE donation can make this production possible!
   What We Need & Where it goes 
Here is our touring budget! 
Theatre Rental: $3,757.44-
Fringe Registration Fee: $450.49-
Accomodation Fee: $3,500.00-
PR Fee: $3,000-
Transportation: $3,500.00-
---------------------------------------
TOTAL: $15,000 (rounded up)-
    The Impact


The awards we received last fall were a huge
encouragement for us to keep doing what we are doing. People may know the story
of Medea, and may have seen other Medeas onstage, but no one has ever seen a Butoh Medea. Sharing the form of Butoh
and Ren Gyo Soh's mission is the key to this project. Your donation will
support not only our dream, but will also encourage anyone who is interested in
Butoh and dance/theatre in general.



Yokko's Pledge

It is a huge financial and professional risk to take a
show to another country, and this festival will be very challenging to me as a
performer.  The festival will include 21 shows in 3 weeks—nearly one show
everyday. So, every time I perform, I will be drenched in sweat; I will be
mentally, physically, emotionally and spiritually exhausted, but I vow to give
every ounce of my being to my audience every day. That is my pledge.

    Other Ways You Can Help 
Please spread the word as much as possible, and help us make this show happen!!

<h3>Who are Colla Voce?</h3>
<ul>
<li>As a new, emerging theatre group, Colla Voce Theatre has enjoyed great success in the company’s hometown of Sheffield. Having received rave reviews for their production of “The Last Five Years” (“truly remarkable”, 5* - Blunt Cinema) and the Colla Voce Cabaret (“where self derision and sheer fun meet talent and sensitivity”, 5* - Forge Press), they now premiere their first piece of original writing: “Buried: A New Musical” written by Tom Williams and Cordelia O’Driscoll.</li>
<li>The company performs musical theatre with a fresh take - they showcase the unusual, the forgotten and the undiscovered. Whether they are producing stories that rarely get told, or stories that have never been told before, Colla Voce Theatre attempts to challenge the conceptions of what musical theatre can be.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What is 'Buried' about?</h3>
<ul>
<li>He’s a shy, seemingly-average young professional. She’s a sarcastic thrill-seeker. After matching on an online dating service, this young and fun-loving couple form a unique relationship when they discover something special that they have in common: they’re both serial killers.</li>
<li>“Buried: A New Musical” tells the story of these exceptional characters as they join forces, setting out on a trail of deception and murder whilst simultaneously attempting to navigate their way through the world of normal, adult relationships. Combining a beautiful, folk-inspired score and a bitingly funny script, this new musical puts a bloody spin on the traditional rom-com, examining the world of relationships when pushed to its extremes.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Your donations help to fund the show!</h3>
<ul>
<li>Putting on a show at the Edinburgh Fringe will be invaluable to our company in terms of exposure, especially with our first ever original musical, however the costs are high.</li>
<li>With all of the incredible talent involved, it would be a shame if we weren't performing the best possible version of the show, and your donation can help us reach this goal! We need to raise enough money to cover technical costs (such as microphones, costuming and set) and also venue hire.</li>
<li>By donating towards 'Buried', you're investing in an emerging theatre company with a lot of potential. You're also eligible for some of our fantastic perks, such as an original song written for you by the show's writers, or having a character in 'Buried' named after you!</li>

<h3>Bref résumé, pas si bref !<br/>
</h3>
<p>J'ai eu des idées. <br/></p>
<p>Alors, j'ai rassemblé Karina, Catherine, Sylvie et Sonya pour créer le duo Ruminant Ruminant. <br/></p>
<p>Il s'agit d'une sorte d'<b>objet dansant non identifié</b>,  mais ils appellent ça une pièce ou un spectacle. Cette chose, qui prend vit sur scène, demande des ressources matérielles et humaines qui ne sont pas gratuites... hé non !</p>
<p>En 2014 et 2015, grâce à 8 partenaires humains et institutionnels, nous avons pu créer et présenter Ruminant Ruminant à Montréal, à Québec et à Val-David ; ci-bas je vous laisse découvrir les complices de notre aventure ""ruminatoire"". <br/></p>
<p>Les 7 et 8 juin, c'est au <b>Théâtre des Écuries et grâce au soutien du OFFTA</b> que nous présenterons à nouveau Ruminant Ruminant.</p>
<p><b>Cependant</b>, cette fois-ci nous n'avons que 2 partenaires humains et institutionnels (susmentionnés en gras). <b>Donc</b>, à travers cette plateforme web nous cherchons d'autres partenaires : des humains, c'est-à-dire <b>VOUS </b>! <br/></p>
<p> C'est <b>VOUS</b> en effet, à la mesure de vos moyens, qui pouvez contribuer à la réussite de notre levée de fonds pour nous permettre de couvrir les cachets et dépenses de :</p>
<p>- Karina Iraola et Brice Noeser (qui font 20 heures de répétition)<br/></p>
<p>- Sylvie Nobert  (qui s'occupe de la technique)<br/></p>
<p>- Catherine Tardif (qui nous assiste chorégraphiquement)<br/></p>
<p>- Sonya Stefan (qui fait le montage vidéo)</p>
<p>Avec ces artistes chevronnés, nous avons récolté  de chouettes critiques, en voici deux extraits : <br/></p>
<p>« <i>C'est
parti pour un spectacle sans nul autre pareil. Bel ovni ludique, éclaté, rempli
de magnifiques juxtapositions inattendues et de changements à vue. Rien n'est
caché, tout est dévoilé. Une drôle de création qui amène le spectateur dans un
univers ludique bourré d'humour. Vous ne verrez plus Brice Noeser et Karina
Iraola de la même façon. </i>» 
Robert Boisclair,
Les enfants du paradis bloguent, janvier 2015, Québec.
</p>
<p><i>« Chaque fois que la danse apparaît, c’est avec surprise.
Pourtant, nous assistons à un spectacle de danse ! se rappelle-t-on. C’est là
la force de Noeser, un chorégraphe qui défie nos attentes à tout moment dans
une pièce où l’on ressent une grande liberté. » </i>Sylvain Verstricht, dans Local Gesture, décembre

<p><b>QUELQUES
PROPOS... POUR FINIR !<br/></b></p>
<p> Il y a
eu d’abord les mots, ceux qui servaient à me lire des histoires quand j’étais
enfant. Avec ces mots, je me suis mis à imaginer et à écrire mes propres
histoires. Avec d’autres mots, j’ai ensuite appris l’allemand, l’anglais, l’espagnol,
le portugais. Ma grande curiosité m’a aussi poussé à apprendre le latin, puis à
inventer mes propres mots, mes propres langues. Parallèlement le cinéma m’a
toujours fasciné, notamment les comédies musicales qui m’ont données envie de
danser dans ma chambre, dans un studio, dans une école de danse, sur
scène ! Après avoir appris le mouvement, je me suis mis à créer mes
propres mouvements. On me dit  « chorégraphe »; je me dis que je
n’aime pas trop ce mot. Je tente alors de trouver d’autres mots pour mieux
traduire ce que je suis, ce qui m’anime. Peut-être serait-ce le mot
« penseur » ? Parce que j’aime penser, faire penser, voir
quelqu’un penser et explorer la présence de la pensée dans l’action ou
l’inaction. Ou alors suis-je « parleur » ? J’aime en effet
parler pour ne rien dire, parler en mettant en relief les formulations cocasses
que j’entends. Et pourquoi pas « danseur » ? Après tout j’aime
danser pour les autres, faire danser les autres, danser pour moi-même et pour
habiter l’espace intérieur, celui de mon corps, et l’espace extérieur, celui de
ma chambre, d’un studio, d’une scène. Je suis ce même danseur qui crée des
mécanismes gestuels réglés comme des horloges, ou encore des concepts de
mouvements qui impliquent des prises de décisions sur le rythme de la
performance ; ce même danseur qui utilise le temps, le son, la musique, le
silence ou le texte pour jouer avec des décalages, créer des jeux d’adresse ou
encore scruter la construction du langage. Et puis, il y a toujours ces passions
pour la linguistique et le réalisme du septième art qui continuent de
m’inspirer et de teinter ce qu’on appelle ma démarche artistique.  <br/></p>

</div></div>","Bref résumé, pas si bref !

J'ai eu des idées. 
Alors, j'ai rassemblé Karina, Catherine, Sylvie et Sonya pour créer le duo Ruminant Ruminant. 
Il s'agit d'une sorte d'objet dansant non identifié,  mais ils appellent ça une pièce ou un spectacle. Cette chose, qui prend vit sur scène, demande des ressources matérielles et humaines qui ne sont pas gratuites... hé non !
En 2014 et 2015, grâce à 8 partenaires humains et institutionnels, nous avons pu créer et présenter Ruminant Ruminant à Montréal, à Québec et à Val-David ; ci-bas je vous laisse découvrir les complices de notre aventure ""ruminatoire"". 
Les 7 et 8 juin, c'est au Théâtre des Écuries et grâce au soutien du OFFTA que nous présenterons à nouveau Ruminant Ruminant.
Cependant, cette fois-ci nous n'avons que 2 partenaires humains et institutionnels (susmentionnés en gras). Donc, à travers cette plateforme web nous cherchons d'autres partenaires : des humains, c'est-à-dire VOUS ! 
 C'est VOUS en effet, à la mesure de vos moyens, qui pouvez contribuer à la réussite de notre levée de fonds pour nous permettre de couvrir les cachets et dépenses de :
- Karina Iraola et Brice Noeser (qui font 20 heures de répétition)
- Sylvie Nobert  (qui s'occupe de la technique)
- Catherine Tardif (qui nous assiste chorégraphiquement)
- Sonya Stefan (qui fait le montage vidéo)
Avec ces artistes chevronnés, nous avons récolté  de chouettes critiques, en voici deux extraits : 
« C'est
parti pour un spectacle sans nul autre pareil. Bel ovni ludique, éclaté, rempli
de magnifiques juxtapositions inattendues et de changements à vue. Rien n'est
caché, tout est dévoilé. Une drôle de création qui amène le spectateur dans un
univers ludique bourré d'humour. Vous ne verrez plus Brice Noeser et Karina
Iraola de la même façon. » 
Robert Boisclair,
Les enfants du paradis bloguent, janvier 2015, Québec.

« Chaque fois que la danse apparaît, c’est avec surprise.
Pourtant, nous assistons à un spectacle de danse ! se rappelle-t-on. C’est là
la force de Noeser, un chorégraphe qui défie nos attentes à tout moment dans
une pièce où l’on ressent une grande liberté. » Sylvain Verstricht, dans Local Gesture, décembre
2014, Montréal.

<p>Beige Theatre Co is putting on David Gow's Cherry Docs, in its 20th anniversary year. The story follows Mike, a neo-Nazi Skinhead who is charged with murder, and Danny, a liberal Jewish Lawyer who is assigned as his public defender. An epic battle leaves each man marked by the other’s belief, Cherry Docs is a provocative exploration of the inescapable and insidious presence of hatred in our society.</p>
<p>In 2017, the themes depicted in Cherry Docs are as relevant as they were at the play's conception 20 years ago. Why is that? Why have we not listened to history? We believe that this show is particularly important to stage because, in order to reflect, we need to expose the ugliness, the hatred, the horrible acts that we as humans are capable of committing. Let us then reflect on our own realities, our own prejudices, and how our native justice system  here in Canada deals with those who are incarcerated.</p>
<p>Canada is a multicultural country. We know that. We are taught it in school and, for Canadians, especially those living in big cities, we see and hear it around us everyday; written on restaurant signs, advertising delectable ‘ethnic’ cuisine, and on crowded metro cars and buses where chatter abounds in a multiplicity of tongues. But what does it actually mean? What does it mean to live it? Why are hate crimes, the tensions, the injustices covered with a flashy sticker deeming Canada a ‘multicultural’ and ‘tolerant’ place. If multiculturalism leads to either a ‘melting pot’ or segregation, and tolerance implies a power dynamic, what does that say about racial, ethnic, and cultural tensions in Canada? This play is not about good and evil. It’s about how race, class, ethnicity and culture intersect and interact with the institutions that are upheld by the privileged. It’s about how the society we are complicit in shapes us. It’s about breaking that mould and the tedious process of learning and unlearning the way we interact with others. It’s about pain. It’s about hope.</p>

As a performer in my discipline? The dynamics change often and dancers have to adapt so quickly, the techniques merge with each other, evolve, divide and others are born: how do I keep my inspiration and knowledge up to date? How do I organise my time and money to be an artist 365 days a year? And especially how do I keep this flame burning every day to train and to be ready for anything anytime? Discipline, resilience, abandonment, risks, curiosity, failures, control and perseverance ... it is a unique and demanding environment! These are the questions I’m asking myself after 5 years dancing in Montreal and today, I’ve decided to push my boundaries further as a dance artist.</p><p><strong><u>TO BE A DANCER !</u></strong></p><p>For many of you reading this, the world of dance is probably an unknown environment. That's why I’ll take a few moments to describe the beauty of this universe with all its passion, complexity and intelligence.</p><p>Everything looks so simple when it’s finished, but just like a beautiful piece of music, or a gripping film - the time, energy and rigorous process that a project requires often goes unnoticed... this is no different as a dancer. There is a whole lifetime of work behind any given dancer and continuous effort every day that lead to the point of dancing professionally. </p><p>All these hours of work are to perfect our knowledge of movement, to learn different artistic worlds of choreographers through shows or open rehearsals, through events or fundraisers that we attend to meet people and make connections, to present ourselves at auditions, to be our own manager and promote our own projects. This is all motivated by a strong passion that makes all the hours worth it. I’m motivated every day to surpass myself so that I can take part in projects that bring let viewers experience beauty and suffering and joy and love all at once. Projects that have real meaning.</p><p><u><strong>WHO AM I ?</strong></u></p><p>I have been practicing professionally in Canada for 5 years, I work for 3 companies, for various projects and I also teach young people and pre-professionals. The desire to collaborate with artists and my eagerness to work in this profession has brought me to experiences that have been true sources of inspiration and helped build my confidence as a dancer. I have learned so much from the artists in this community.</p><p>Today I invite you to discover my passion by watching this short film that explains why I am seeking help to undertake this new step in my career. A new achievement to find answers and push my artistic questioning further. I settled for a few years in Montreal and Ottawa, and today I would like to find my way in Europe. Guided by my instinct and my curiosity, I have been contemplating this move for a long time. I want to be immersed in different cultures, take up new challenges, discover other environments and immerse myself in new ideas and the foundations of contemporary dance.</p><p><u><strong>WHY THIS PROJECT ?</strong></u></p><p>How was this idea of ​​going to Europe born? In 2016, I decided to leave for 3 months to dive back into my roots and explore Europe, my goal was to discover different communities while traveling to destinations for dance workshops and shows. Living out of my backpack, I participated in several intensives workshops in Paris, Berlin, Brussels, Prague, Amsterdam and Montpellier. This adventure had a big impact on my career and kick-started a period of curiosity about what I wanted to do as a dancer. I decided to continue my career in Canada to strengthen the connections I had created and my career began to take off with many projects between Ottawa and Montreal. </p><p>In 2017, I returned to Europe, invited by choreographer Jocelyn Todd to come and create a new piece of contemporary dance in London. Three weeks went by and I had the chance to dance <i>Time + Light</i>  in the Festival Resolution, a platform that allows young companies based in Europe to present their work. Once again, this idea was reinforced during this experiment. </p><p>My experiences and meetings in Canada motivate me and encourage me to go further in this art, but now, I am ready to make the leap to further myself as a professional performer in Europe as well.</p><p><strong><u>HOW ?</u></strong></p><p>First step of this launch, was returning to France, which I did in early July. Several internships have been planned in different communities in Europe with the aim of starting to create a professional network.</p><p><i>The first intensive is located in the city of Deltebre located two hours from Barcelona where I had the chance to work with world renowned artists. I learned different techniques of floorwork, deepening my knowledge of partner work, discovering dance and circus performances, attending conferences and creating new links. During this two-week festival, different events, contexts, elements and tools were brought to feed my artistic research and to integrate new dance approaches to my work tool: the body.</i></p><p><i>The second workshop takes place in Amsterdam, an important platform for contemporary dance in Europe. For over 3 years, I have been curious to experience Countertechnique and finally, I have the chance to participate in the largest internship they offer in Amsterdam, where this research was born. It will be two intensive weeks where we are working on the science of movement and the human body. This technique was developed to give tools and balance the practice of a professional dancer in a healthy way, whether in the context of rehearsing, training or performing.</i></p><p>After only 5 weeks, I am already tracking and looking for opportunities. I have been invited by a company based in Switzerland and I would like to discover the movement style and the foundations of their work through the internship they will offer in August.</p><p>As you can see in a very short time, many opportunities have come up to evolve as an interpreter. As I move forward, I am confident that this journey will bring with it new knowledge and help me to push my current capabilities to new levels.</p><p>In the longer term, my goal is to base myself in a European city. The first year will allow me to identify companies, platforms, residences: this is why this project requires a large budget. I need to start by studying many different approaches and procedures at the same time as to finance travel and housing.</p><p><i>I would like to be based in a major contemporary dance platform for 3 months to help me kick-start my career. Cities like Brussels or Berlin would be a good starting point for new learning over a longer period. Deepening techniques, researching new methodologies, strengthening and creating connections while being pro-active in my search for contracts will be my main goals during this experience.</i></p><p><strong><u>WHERE YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS ARE GOING ?</u></strong></p><p>Below are the different elements that the financing collected during this campaign will cover: </p><ul>
<li>the internship, accommodation and travel for Deltebre as well as the internship, accommodation and travel from Amsterdam to the amount of 2350 €.</li>
<li>the internship of the company in Switzerland (travel, housing, internship) for about 550 €.</li>
<li>the immersive experience of being in the heart of a hub in contemporary dance with 3 months of housing (2100 €), training (1200 €) and travel (300 €) for a total of 3600€.</li>
</ul><p>Europe is full of opportunities in dance and with this campaign, it will unlock new connections and allow me to attend other auditions in the 2019/2020 season.</p><p><strong><u>TODAY</u></strong></p><p>Being a dancer is like being in school throughout your career because it is a complex and constantly evolving field with few paid contracts. We train in professional schools for 3 or 4 years to learn a foundation and then it takes years before you can get to know your body and gather expertise. It requires discipline, resilience, perseverance, patience and courage. We must learn to live with abandon, to let go as much as to learn how to welcome our failures. It is a job where you have to be constantly on the lookout, to be open-minded, to question yourself and to develop an intelligence in the balance of mind and body.</p><p>When I started working on this fundraising campaign, I was in Guelph in southern Canada (1 hour from Toronto) where I shared my passion for movement with 15 young dancers. A joy to be able to exchange and see how much dance awakens and transports us. I continue to collaborate with choreographers in Canada and I’m feeling really grateful to be able to dance in both continents.</p><p>Today, I feel lucky to be part of this stimulating and rewarding world where we constantly put ourselves outside of our comfort zone to live deeply human moments. It is here that I ask you to help me to bring to life one of the biggest decisions of my early career and it is with your help that I will be able to realize it. Thank you very much for taking your time to read !</p><p> </p><p>A huge thank you for your support !</p><p>Have a look at the perks of the contributions !</p><p> </p><p>Share my Indiegogo page to help me spread out the word !</p><p>Follow me on Instagram : jl_mov.art</p><p> </p><p>Photo credit : Ben Walland, Benoit Desjardins, Gilles Vézina, Sasha Onyshchenko.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565952402/cec74qyzxzuolana3wpr.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>Comment évoluer en tant qu’artiste aujourd’hui ? En tant qu’interprète en danse contemporaine ? La dynamique change vite et il faut s’adapter rapidement, les techniques de danse se fondent entre elles, évoluent, se divisent et d’autres naissent : comment garder notre inspiration et nos connaissances à l’ordre du jour ? Comment organiser son temps et son argent pour être artiste 365 jours par an ? Et surtout comment garder cette flamme en nous qui nous pousse chaque jour à nous entraîner pour être prêt à tout n’importe quand ? Discipline, résilience, abandon, risques, curiosité, échecs, contrôle et persévérance… c’est un milieu très vigoureux et unique! Ce sont les questions que je me pose après 5 années de carrière à Montréal et aujourd’hui, je décide de pousser plus loin mes limites en tant qu'interprète professionnelle.</p><p><strong><u>ÊTRE UN DANSEUR !</u></strong></p><p>Pour la plupart d’entre vous, la danse est probablement un domaine inconnu. C’est pour cela que je prends quelques instants pour vous décrire la beauté de cet univers avec toute sa fougue, sa complexité et son intelligence.</p><p>Lorsque nous apprécions une pièce chorégraphique, de théâtre ou de musique - le temps, l’énergie et le processus rigoureux que ces projets demandent, passent souvent inaperçus…. Et cela rejoint exactement le cas d’un danseur où nous passons à travers de nombreuses étapes avant de décrocher un contrat. Il y a tout un travail considérable derrière un danseur motivé et qui met un effort constant chaque jour pour nous amener à danser professionnellement.</p><p>Toutes ces heures de travail à parfaire nos connaissances du mouvement, à apprendre les différents univers des compagnies à travers des spectacles ou des répétitions ouvertes, des évènements ou soirées bénéfices auxquels nous assistons pour rencontrer et encourager nos pairs, nous présenter à des auditions, être mon propre manager pour gérer mes contrats ou promouvoir mes projets. Ce qui me motive à me surpasser tous les jours dans cette passion : est de pouvoir faire partie de projets éphémères qui s’épanouissent à travers nos différentes cultures et qui sont transportés par les émotions que nous partageons.</p><p><u><strong>QUI SUIS-JE ?</strong></u></p><p>Cela fait 5 années que j’exerce professionnellement au Canada en danse contemporaine, je travaille pour 3 compagnies, pour divers projets et j’enseigne également aux jeunes et pré-professionnelles. Le désir de collaborer avec des artistes, ma soif d’apprendre ce métier s’est ancrée en moi dans ce métier au fil de mes expériences qui ont été de vraies sources d’inspirations et m’ont aidé à créer une confiance en tant qu’artiste. J’ai beaucoup appris à travers de profonds dialogues et de riches rencontres dans cette communauté qui ont su stimulé ma curiosité.</p><p>C’est pour cela qu’aujourd’hui, je vous invite à découvrir le fruit de ma passion et je vous présente ce court-métrage pour chercher de l’aide afin de réaliser le projet de cette nouvelle étape dans ma carrière. Un nouvel accomplissement pour trouver des réponses et pousser mon questionnement artistique plus loin. Je me suis établie pendant quelques années au Canada puis aujourd’hui, j’aimerais tracer mon chemin en Europe. Toujours guider par mon instinct et ma curiosité, cela a été une longue réflexion de trois années. J’aime être baignée dans différentes cultures, relever de nouveaux défis, découvrir d’autres milieux puis plonger dans de nouvelles idées et fondements de la danse contemporaine.</p><p><strong><u>POURQUOI CE PROJET ?</u></strong></p><p>Comment cette idée de partir en Europe est née ? En 2016, j’ai décidé de partir pendant 3 mois pour replonger dans mes racines et aller explorer l’Europe, mon but était de découvrir les différentes communautés tout en voyageant à travers la danse. En backpack, j’ai participé à plusieurs stages de perfectionnement dans les villes de Paris, Berlin, Bruxelles, Prague, Amsterdam et Montpellier. Cette aventure a eu un important impact sur ma carrière et a certainement été le début de ce nouveau questionnement par rapport à mes rêves d’interprète. J’ai décidé de poursuivre ma carrière à Montréal afin de renforcer les liens que je créais : j’étais diplômée depuis 2 années à ce moment-là et ma carrière a pris son envol par la suite entre les communautés de Montréal et Ottawa. </p><p>En 2017, je suis retournée en Europe, invitée par la chorégraphe Jocelyn Todd à venir créer une nouvelle pièce de danse contemporaine à Londres. Trois semaines se sont enchaînées et j’ai eu la chance de danser <i>Time+Light</i> dans le Festival Resolution, une plateforme qui permet aux jeunes compagnies basées en Europe de présenter leur travail. Encore une fois, cette idée s’est renforcée lors de cette expérience. </p><p>En étant située à Montréal, on se rend compte que beaucoup d’échanges et de collaborations sont crées dans le milieu artistique. C’est une ville en effervescence où mes expériences m’ont motivé et encouragé à me projeter plus loin dans cet art et aujourd’hui, je suis prête à faire le grand saut pour percer mes ambitions de danseuse professionnelle en Europe.</p><p><strong><u>COMMENT ?</u></strong></p><p>Première étape de ce lancement, mon retour s’est fait dès début Juillet. J'ai planifié plusieurs stages dans différentes communautés en Europe dans le but de commencer à créer un réseau professionnel. </p><p><i>Le premier intensif est situé dans la ville de Deltebre situé à deux heures de Barcelone où j’ai eu la chance de travailler avec plusieurs artistes renommés dans le monde. J’ai pu apprendre différentes techniques de travail au sol, approfondir mes connaissances de travail de partenaire, découvrir des spectacles de danse et de cirque, assister à des conférences et créer de nouveaux liens. Durant ce festival de deux semaines, différents évènements, contextes, éléments et outils ont été apportés afin de nourrir ma recherche artistique et d’intégrer de nouvelles approches de la danse à mon outil de travail : le corps.</i></p><p><i>Le deuxième stage se déroule à Amsterdam, une importante plateforme de danse contemporaine en Europe. Depuis plus de 3 ans, je suis curieuse de vivre l’expérience du Countertechnique et enfin, j’ai la chance de participer au plus grand stage qu’ils offrent à Amsterdam, d’où cette recherche est née. C’est deux semaines intensives où nous travaillons la science du mouvement et du corps humain. Cette technique a été développé afin d’outiller et d’équilibrer la pratique d’un danseur professionnel sainement que ce soit dans un contexte de répétition, d’entraînement ou de performance.</i></p><p>Après seulement 5 semaines, je suis déjà en repérage et à la recherche d’opportunités. Je suis invitée à une audition pour une compagnie basée en Suisse et j’aimerais découvrir le style de mouvement et les fondements de leur travail par le biais du stage qu’ils offrent au mois d’Août prochain. </p><p>Comme vous pouvez voir en très peu de temps, beaucoup d’opportunités sont à la portée de main afin d’évoluer en tant qu’interprète. En allant de l’avant, je suis confiante que ce cheminement portera ses fruits et transportera mon bagage acquis vers de nouveaux horizons. </p><p>Sur du plus long terme, j’ai pour objectif de me baser dans une ville d’Europe pour me développer artistiquement dans une communauté. La première année me permettra de cerner les compagnies, les plateformes, les résidences : c’est pour cela que ce projet demande un budget important pour démarrer. Je dois étudier toutes ces différentes démarches et aspects en même temps que de financer les déplacements et le logement.</p><p><i>Pour ce faire, j’aimerais me baser pendant 3 mois dans une plateforme importante afin que cela me serve de tremplin. Les villes comme Bruxelles ou Berlin seraient un bon point de départ afin d’être baigné dans un nouveau bassin sur une plus longue période.

The dynamics change often and dancers have to adapt so quickly, the techniques merge with each other, evolve, divide and others are born: how do I keep my inspiration and knowledge up to date? How do I organise my time and money to be an artist 365 days a year? And especially how do I keep this flame burning every day to train and to be ready for anything anytime? Discipline, resilience, abandonment, risks, curiosity, failures, control and perseverance ... it is a unique and demanding environment! These are the questions I’m asking myself after 5 years dancing in Montreal and today, I’ve decided to push my boundaries further as a dance artist.TO BE A DANCER !For many of you reading this, the world of dance is probably an unknown environment. That's why I’ll take a few moments to describe the beauty of this universe with all its passion, complexity and intelligence.Everything looks so simple when it’s finished, but just like a beautiful piece of music, or a gripping film - the time, energy and rigorous process that a project requires often goes unnoticed... this is no different as a dancer. There is a whole lifetime of work behind any given dancer and continuous effort every day that lead to the point of dancing professionally. All these hours of work are to perfect our knowledge of movement, to learn different artistic worlds of choreographers through shows or open rehearsals, through events or fundraisers that we attend to meet people and make connections, to present ourselves at auditions, to be our own manager and promote our own projects. This is all motivated by a strong passion that makes all the hours worth it. I’m motivated every day to surpass myself so that I can take part in projects that bring let viewers experience beauty and suffering and joy and love all at once. Projects that have real meaning.WHO AM I ?I have been practicing professionally in Canada for 5 years, I work for 3 companies, for various projects and I also teach young people and pre-professionals. The desire to collaborate with artists and my eagerness to work in this profession has brought me to experiences that have been true sources of inspiration and helped build my confidence as a dancer. I have learned so much from the artists in this community.Today I invite you to discover my passion by watching this short film that explains why I am seeking help to undertake this new step in my career. A new achievement to find answers and push my artistic questioning further. I settled for a few years in Montreal and Ottawa, and today I would like to find my way in Europe. Guided by my instinct and my curiosity, I have been contemplating this move for a long time. I want to be immersed in different cultures, take up new challenges, discover other environments and immerse myself in new ideas and the foundations of contemporary dance.WHY THIS PROJECT ?How was this idea of ​​going to Europe born? In 2016, I decided to leave for 3 months to dive back into my roots and explore Europe, my goal was to discover different communities while traveling to destinations for dance workshops and shows. Living out of my backpack, I participated in several intensives workshops in Paris, Berlin, Brussels, Prague, Amsterdam and Montpellier. This adventure had a big impact on my career and kick-started a period of curiosity about what I wanted to do as a dancer. I decided to continue my career in Canada to strengthen the connections I had created and my career began to take off with many projects between Ottawa and Montreal. In 2017, I returned to Europe, invited by choreographer Jocelyn Todd to come and create a new piece of contemporary dance in London. Three weeks went by and I had the chance to dance Time + Light  in the Festival Resolution, a platform that allows young companies based in Europe to present their work. Once again, this idea was reinforced during this experiment. My experiences and meetings in Canada motivate me and encourage me to go further in this art, but now, I am ready to make the leap to further myself as a professional performer in Europe as well.HOW ?First step of this launch, was returning to France, which I did in early July. Several internships have been planned in different communities in Europe with the aim of starting to create a professional network.The first intensive is located in the city of Deltebre located two hours from Barcelona where I had the chance to work with world renowned artists. I learned different techniques of floorwork, deepening my knowledge of partner work, discovering dance and circus performances, attending conferences and creating new links. During this two-week festival, different events, contexts, elements and tools were brought to feed my artistic research and to integrate new dance approaches to my work tool: the body.The second workshop takes place in Amsterdam, an important platform for contemporary dance in Europe. For over 3 years, I have been curious to experience Countertechnique and finally, I have the chance to participate in the largest internship they offer in Amsterdam, where this research was born. It will be two intensive weeks where we are working on the science of movement and the human body. This technique was developed to give tools and balance the practice of a professional dancer in a healthy way, whether in the context of rehearsing, training or performing.After only 5 weeks, I am already tracking and looking for opportunities. I have been invited by a company based in Switzerland and I would like to discover the movement style and the foundations of their work through the internship they will offer in August.As you can see in a very short time, many opportunities have come up to evolve as an interpreter. As I move forward, I am confident that this journey will bring with it new knowledge and help me to push my current capabilities to new levels.In the longer term, my goal is to base myself in a European city. The first year will allow me to identify companies, platforms, residences: this is why this project requires a large budget. I need to start by studying many different approaches and procedures at the same time as to finance travel and housing.I would like to be based in a major contemporary dance platform for 3 months to help me kick-start my career. Cities like Brussels or Berlin would be a good starting point for new learning over a longer period. Deepening techniques, researching new methodologies, strengthening and creating connections while being pro-active in my search for contracts will be my main goals during this experience.WHERE YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS ARE GOING ?Below are the different elements that the financing collected during this campaign will cover: 
the internship, accommodation and travel for Deltebre as well as the internship, accommodation and travel from Amsterdam to the amount of 2350 €.
the internship of the company in Switzerland (travel, housing, internship) for about 550 €.
the immersive experience of being in the heart of a hub in contemporary dance with 3 months of housing (2100 €), training (1200 €) and travel (300 €) for a total of 3600€.
Europe is full of opportunities in dance and with this campaign, it will unlock new connections and allow me to attend other auditions in the 2019/2020 season.TODAYBeing a dancer is like being in school throughout your career because it is a complex and constantly evolving field with few paid contracts. We train in professional schools for 3 or 4 years to learn a foundation and then it takes years before you can get to know your body and gather expertise.

C’est ici que je vous demande de m’aider à réaliser sûrement l’une de mes plus grandes décisions de ma jeune carrière, il faut un début à tout et c’est avec votre aide que je vais pouvoir le réaliser. Merci beaucoup d’avoir pris le temps de me lire ! Un énorme merci pour votre support ! Jetez un coup d'oeil aux prix des contributions ! Partagez ma page Indiegogo pour m'aider à diffuser ma campagne !Suivez-moi sur Instagram : jl_mov.art Crédit photo : Ben Walland, Benoit Desjardins, Gilles Vézina, Sasha Onyshchenko.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>House of Stray Cats is a Croydon based theatre company that specialises in both puppet making and generating original puppet theatre.  We have been taken on by the Little Angel theatre in London as part of their FIRSTS festival and will be one of the first companies to perform in their brand new studio space with our production, 'The Dream Factory'.  Our piece is a wordless, sensory puppet show for both children and adults that follows the journey of a young girl who has lost her ability to dream.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">DID YOU KNOW...</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Every night during sleep, each of us creates around 5 dream episodes,</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">These dreams can last between 15 &amp; 40 minutes,</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">So we all spend around 2 hours dreaming every night...</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">With 7 billion dreamers on planet earth,</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">That means we collectively create 35 billion dreams in any 24 hour period.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Dreaming is something that connects absolutely everyone.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Dreams are more important than we could ever imagine!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This will be our first ever full production as a company and we are already lucky enough to have secured 3 incredible venues and an outstanding team of creatives... literally the stuff that dreams are made of!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our Arts Council application has now been rejected 3 times and we are now unable to reapply due to time constraints.  We understand that we will no longer be able to get the full amount of money that we were aiming for, but we would like to raise as much as possible in order to guarantee a small amount of money to the incredible creatives that are already on-board for the show.  With your help, we will be able to create something incredible, that will go on to reach audiences all over the country.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>When applying for our Arts Council funding, we requested £14,470... now we understand that this is no longer do-able, but with you're help, we'd like to try and raise £2000 which will go towards guaranteeing some money for the incredible artists that are already involved in the project.  Here are just a few of these amazing creatives:</p>

<p><strong>What is our Mission?</strong></p>
<p>We aim to create quality professional theater entertainment with the main storytelling focus of the Rural American Experience. It is our hope that we can both hold a mirror up to nature, allowing our rural residents to see themselves and their stories represented with empathy and compassion, as well as be an extension of the country experience for tourists visiting from the city.</p>
<p><strong>What is Klinkhart Hall Arts Center?</strong></p>
<p>Klinkhart Hall Arts Center, Inc. is a not-for-profit organization that seeks to preserve the historic Klinkhart Hall building in Sharon Springs, New York and to establish it as an arts center serving the local and regional communities. Klinkhart Hall will host and produce high quality programs in the performing, visual and other arts. In addition, Klinkhart Hall will offer cultural, civic educational programming that will promote its philosophy of inclusion and diversity.</p>
<p>For more information, visit <a href=""http://www.Klinkhart.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.Klinkhart.org</a></p>
<p><strong>What is Brimstone Creek Productions?</strong></p>
<p>We are the current “Theater Company in Residence” with Klinkhart Hall Arts Center. We are the entity in charge of hiring, casting, and producing As You Like It. We oversee everything that is going to happen “on stage” whereas Klinkhart hall oversees everything off stage, what would be considered “Front of House.”</p>
<p><strong>Why the Rural American Experience?</strong></p>
<p>Short answer: because our company is in Rural America.</p>
<p>Just as you can find countless plays about life in New York City in New York City, as well as countless movies about LA coming out of Hollywood, Brimstone Creek aims to represent the place that we call home.</p>
<p>Recent events have shown that there is a growing disconnect between rural and urban communities. It’s our hope that, with our cross section of urban tourists and rural residents, we can produce programming that can, even just a little bit, heal that divide.</p>
<p>We aim to do so by producing Rural American stories told with empathy and compassion, not avoiding human flaws, but always presented with three dimensions.</p>
<p><strong>Why As You Like It?</strong></p>
<p>The short answer: It’s public domain. Since we don’t have to spend money on rights, we can spend more on actors, marketing, costumes, etc.</p>
<p>The long, and much more important, answer: As You Like It provides the best way to introduce ourselves as a company to the area. For me, Sharon Springs is the Forest of Arden. I see every character in this play represented in the community my husband and I now call home.</p>
<p>With its story of an exiled court and rural shepherds as they coexist in the Forest of Arden, it’s our hope to demonstrate the quality of theater than can exist even before Klinkhart Hall is renovated.</p>
<p>It also allows the farmer, the tourist, and the Manhattan ex-patriot to all see themselves represented in our first show out of the gate.</p>
<p><strong>Why free?</strong></p>
<p>To start a theater company is to tilt at windmills. Having not produced a show in Sharon Springs before, we have no way of knowing how successfully it will be received. By making the first taste free, we can get a base line for local interest in professional theater.</p>
<p>We’ll also be asking those who do attend to give us their thoughts on the kind of shows and stories they would like to see as well as what would be considered an affordable ticket price.</p>
<p>No matter how affordable tickets can be, though, there will be those who must choose a meal over entertainment. It is our hope that our annual programming will always include a free Shakespeare in the park so that everyone, regardless of economic status, can experience professional theater.</p>
<p>To put it another way, if we produced a free Shakespeare each summer over the next ten years, then a girl or boy who is 8 years old now will have seen 10 professional production of Shakespeare by the time he or she graduates high school.</p>
<p><strong>How will the money be spent?</strong></p>
<p>It’s our goal to produce As You Like It for $12,000 - $15,000. All funds collected above our final budget costs will be split between future productions and the rehabilitation of Klinkhart Hall.</p>
<p>I’ve set our fundraising goal for $20,000 in the hopes that, should we reach or exceed that goal, we’ll have a head start on producing work beyond As You Like It.</p>
<p>The biggest budget item is paying our actors and director. Since we’re just starting out, we can’t pay them what their worth, but hopefully we can offer them enough to feel comfortable calling off work in the city for the time they’ll be in Sharon Springs.</p>
<p>Some other budget items include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rehearsal Space rental in NYC</li>
<li>Marketing</li>
<li>Set Construction (labor &amp; materials)</li>
<li>Company Travel (Megabus from NYC to Albany)</li>
<li>Music Composition</li>
<li>Fight Choreography</li>
</ul>
<p>In the event we do not reach our needed minimum goal to produce As You Like It, we would re-evaluate and either find a production that we can produce with the money raised, or all funds would go to the rehabilitation of Klinkart Hall.</p>
<p><strong>What would future programming look like?</strong></p>
<p>Is it only going to be stories about the Rural American Experience?</p>
<p>Not at all.</p>
<p>The entire American Theater Cannon is fair game. Hopefully, in the near future, the American Musical Theater Cannon as well. Along with Shakespeare, we’ll look to Wilde, Ibsen, Checkov, and the rest.</p>
<p>Our hope is that our Flagship Show, the central pieces of work that we become known for, have this central theme of the Rural American Experience.</p>
<p>This includes new works as well. We hope to be a destination for new plays and playwrights, including those with rural voices and voices of faith, to workshop their work and put it on its feet.</p>
<p>For the moment, we’ll start with this one show: As You Like It.</p>
<p>Should we be successful in finding an audience, we’ll start work on a holiday production to take place during the Victorian Festival, as well as planning for the summer of 2018. An idea for expansion would be 2 weeks of programming that would include a free Shakespeare in the park and 2 staged productions performing in rep.</p>
<p><strong>What do you mean by diversity in casting?</strong></p>
<p>It’s 2017. America, for all its strengths and its turbulence, is a vastly diverse community. Unless a story, such as To Kill a Mocking Bird, is overtly specific about the race of its characters, we will always strive for diversity. The wider the range of life experience in the rehearsal room, the more rich and nuanced the story telling will be. Transgendered actors and actresses will always be welcome to audition for roles of their identified gender.</p>
<p><strong>Who are you, anyway?</strong></p>
<p>Hi, I’m John. I’ve been a professional actor for going on 17 years. I have my MFA in Acting from the New School for Drama. I co-founded the company behind Festival 56, the largest summer theater festival in the state of Illinois, also with the mission of bringing professional theater to rural America. So, this isn’t my first time down this road.</p>

Love is at the foundation for all we do and passion drives us. Our performances challenge perception. 2 seasons and 11 sold out shows later, here’s how fans have been responding:Unlike most dance shows, our work isn't about abstract ideas but rather concrete experiences. Through carefully designed environments that engage the senses, we transport audiences to a different world; one where it's safe to tackle social issues, poke fun at pop culture, and talk about things normally kept behind closed doors. No single style can tell every story. We needed to develop a new method; one that would allow us to create without constraints.
Dancers commit to 300+ hours of cross training in vogue, contemporary, waacking, popping, house, ballet, top-rocking, hip-hop, and improv. They also go through exercises that create deep emotional connections to the pieces being brought to the stage. It’s a grand experiment to tell familiar stories in unexpected ways.Work like this requires an immense amount of commitment, vulnerability, and resources. Passion isn't always pretty but without it, there's no progress. This campaign is fundraising for our latest season of live (+ live-streamed) shows.Your tax-deductible donation is fuel for our future.DONATE AND STAND WITH US!We stream our shows globally in HD to be enjoy on all mobile / desktop devices.

<p>BONES IN THE BASKET is an evening of Russian fairy tales.  In this vodka-fueled theatrical event, a penniless
troupe of Russian storytellers invade your theatre to try and earn their
supper.  They flirt and tease; they revel
in the gypsy punk stylings of their mysterious one-man band; and all the while
wooing the audience with their renditions of riotously morbid Russian fairy tales
that are not interested in “happily ever after.”</p>
<p><i>WARNING: </i> these
peformers will flirt with you.  They may
offer you a drink.  They may invite you
onstage (or backstage).  They may try and
kiss you.  No matter what, the management
takes NO responsibility for loss of wallets, kidneys (put some ice on it), or

<p>BONES IN THE
BASKET was first developed at the Yale Cabaret in 2009.  It was the first production for a group of
young collaborators who would go on to create a number performances together
over the years, both at Yale School of Drama and as professional theatre
artists.</p>
<p>Now, we are
all working theatre professionals, mostly living in New York City, and we
return to this piece because it remains the touchstone production for our
ensemble.  It encapsulates our collective
voice, our love of storytelling and theatre, and what art can offer human
beings. </p>
<p>The stories
we are pulling from are dark. These fairy tales were being told at a time of
social and political upheaval in rural Russia, just after the revolution and
the world wars. These stories are not the simple morality tales that one
expects from Hans Christian Andersen or the Grimm Brothers.  Instead, they are bloody, morbid, paradoxical
stories where darkness and evil often triumph, and although innocence and
kindness are often praised, cleverness and guile are ultimately rewarded.  These are stories about the step from
childhood to maturity—the moment when innocence is lost, and in that loss, how we
learn to survive. </p>
<p>But in that
recognition of loss, BONES IN THE BASKET captures something vital, for although
these fairy tales are dark and morbid, they are not depressing. The very act of
telling these stories becomes a triumph. </p>
<p>Through
storytelling, the troupe learns to survive. It is the choice to greet the
inevitability of loss and death not with defeat, but with a smile.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>PRODUCING IN NYC:</b></p>
<p>New York City is one of the most vibrant theatrical cities
in the world; it is also one of the most expensive cities in the world, and
producing theatre here is both difficult and costly.  Your donations go directly to support the
artists making this production.  Our hope
is that this presentation of <i>Bones </i>will
be a stepping-stone; a chance to finish the show’s development and then share it
with an audience who are capable of helping it find further life.  And you can be a vital part of that.</p>
<p>Over the next two months we will be striving to raise
$20,000 for this production.  That is a
lot, but all of it is carefully considered to make this the best possible
production.</p>

is going OFF BROADWAY!
And you can be a part
of it, because we can’t do it without you!

BONES IN THE BASKET, first developed at the Yale Cabaret,
has been offered a production at the American Theatre for Actors as part of the
Araca Project!  This is our chance to share this remarkable show with a much
wider audience, and we are asking for your support!
OUR SHOW:

BONES IN THE BASKET is an evening of Russian fairy tales.  In this vodka-fueled theatrical event, a penniless
troupe of Russian storytellers invade your theatre to try and earn their
supper.  They flirt and tease; they revel
in the gypsy punk stylings of their mysterious one-man band; and all the while
wooing the audience with their renditions of riotously morbid Russian fairy tales
that are not interested in “happily ever after.”
WARNING:  these
peformers will flirt with you.  They may
offer you a drink.  They may invite you
onstage (or backstage).  They may try and
kiss you.  No matter what, the management
takes NO responsibility for loss of wallets, kidneys (put some ice on it), or
hearts.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Kate Kaminski was a high school drama nerd who took a long detour to the road to PortFringe 2019. Kate has been making films in Maine since 1990 but for the past few years she’s been dreaming about bringing her particular style of narrative and cinematic sensibility to live performance. When her long time project <a href=""https://www.bluestockingfilms.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bluestocking Film Series</a> closed in 2018, Kate began teaching on-camera acting workshops and reconnected with her secret desire to write and direct for live audiences.</p>
<p>Thus was the idea for ""Séance on a Tuesday Afternoon"" born in late fall 2018. Borrowing (with gratitude) from the title of one of her favorite films — ""Séance on a Wet Afternoon"" — it became clear that it was time to commit to making something happen. With some great actors on board, and with acceptance to PortFringe, the long-desired live performance project has come together. (More about the actors below.)</p>
<p>This crowdfunding campaign aims to raise funds that will allow us to elevate the visual style of “Séance on a Tuesday Afternoon through production design (set, props, wardrobe, hair &amp; makeup) as well as through audience-interactive elements (shhh….more details about those elements coming soon). We also intend to pay our actors and small crew (artists deserve to be paid for their talents!).</p>
<p>By backing our campaign, you not only join us on our journey, you’ll help us create A Total Experience. We want our audiences to feel like they’re attending a real séance, although one that’s slowly going hilariously off the rails.</p>
<h3>Will you join us?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>What is ""Séance on a Tuesday Afternoon"" about?</strong></i></p>
<p>""Séance on a Tuesday Afternoon"" satirizes cultural appropriation, the self-promotional obsession of online life, online hookups, and the need we all have to believe in something...beyond. Embedded within the audience, the séance gets awkward right away as subterranean jealousies surface and a couple on a first date get disruptive. But when contact with THE FUTURE appears to be happening, and the messages aren’t what anybody is expecting, everything falls into chaos.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We’re budgeting $3,000 to create the most exciting and artful production and graphic/motion design possible and to pay our onstage performers. This will pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Furniture and props (rental / purchase)</li>
<li>Production design + hair/makeup services</li>
<li>Wardrobe (rental / purchase)</li>
<li>Graphic, motion + promotional writing and design services</li>
<li>Interactive elements printing/fabrication costs</li>
<li>Performers in front of the audience (and crew behind the scenes)</li>
</ul>
<p>When you back our campaign, you can choose from a variety of levels of support. And here are some of the exciting perks* we have in store for you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Social media shout with a special ""psychic prediction"" just for you</li>
<li>Video thank you from cast members</li>
<li>Handmade friendship bracelet imbued with psychic protection</li>
<li>A beautiful full-color Protection Disk</li>
<li>Meet The Psychics Happy Hour on Us</li>
<li>Printed thank you in our PortFringe 2019 program</li>
</ul>
<p>If we don’t fully meet our funding goal, we will make compromises where we have to, but will strive to make “Séance on a Tuesday Afternoon” look just as great as if we were fully funded.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>One of the most promising aspects of this venture into live performance is the opportunity to combine theatrical and cinematic conventions in an immersive and interactive experience for the performers and audience alike. As a hybrid, our project is part of a spectrum of immersive experiences that are on the cutting edge of next wave entertainment.</p>
<p>As women makers, we have faced a lot of barriers and we’ve dealt with those barriers by going around them, taking the long way, and most often doing it ourselves. We are boldly going where we haven’t been before because that is the way artists grow. We’re still growing. We hope you’ll journey with us as we continue to evolve and create new forms of audience-based work.</p>
</div><div>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Kate Kaminski was a high school drama nerd who took a long detour to the road to PortFringe 2019. Kate has been making films in Maine since 1990 but for the past few years she’s been dreaming about bringing her particular style of narrative and cinematic sensibility to live performance. When her long time project Bluestocking Film Series closed in 2018, Kate began teaching on-camera acting workshops and reconnected with her secret desire to write and direct for live audiences.
Thus was the idea for ""Séance on a Tuesday Afternoon"" born in late fall 2018. Borrowing (with gratitude) from the title of one of her favorite films — ""Séance on a Wet Afternoon"" — it became clear that it was time to commit to making something happen. With some great actors on board, and with acceptance to PortFringe, the long-desired live performance project has come together. (More about the actors below.)
This crowdfunding campaign aims to raise funds that will allow us to elevate the visual style of “Séance on a Tuesday Afternoon through production design (set, props, wardrobe, hair & makeup) as well as through audience-interactive elements (shhh….more details about those elements coming soon). We also intend to pay our actors and small crew (artists deserve to be paid for their talents!).
By backing our campaign, you not only join us on our journey, you’ll help us create A Total Experience. We want our audiences to feel like they’re attending a real séance, although one that’s slowly going hilariously off the rails.
Will you join us?
 
What is ""Séance on a Tuesday Afternoon"" about?
""Séance on a Tuesday Afternoon"" satirizes cultural appropriation, the self-promotional obsession of online life, online hookups, and the need we all have to believe in something...beyond. Embedded within the audience, the séance gets awkward right away as subterranean jealousies surface and a couple on a first date get disruptive. But when contact with THE FUTURE appears to be happening, and the messages aren’t what anybody is expecting, everything falls into chaos.

What We Need & What You Get
We’re budgeting $3,000 to create the most exciting and artful production and graphic/motion design possible and to pay our onstage performers. This will pay for:

Furniture and props (rental / purchase)
Production design + hair/makeup services
Wardrobe (rental / purchase)
Graphic, motion + promotional writing and design services
Interactive elements printing/fabrication costs
Performers in front of the audience (and crew behind the scenes)

When you back our campaign, you can choose from a variety of levels of support. And here are some of the exciting perks* we have in store for you.

Social media shout with a special ""psychic prediction"" just for you
Video thank you from cast members
Handmade friendship bracelet imbued with psychic protection
A beautiful full-color Protection Disk
Meet The Psychics Happy Hour on Us
Printed thank you in our PortFringe 2019 program

If we don’t fully meet our funding goal, we will make compromises where we have to, but will strive to make “Séance on a Tuesday Afternoon” look just as great as if we were fully funded.

The Impact
One of the most promising aspects of this venture into live performance is the opportunity to combine theatrical and cinematic conventions in an immersive and interactive experience for the performers and audience alike. As a hybrid, our project is part of a spectrum of immersive experiences that are on the cutting edge of next wave entertainment.
As women makers, we have faced a lot of barriers and we’ve dealt with those barriers by going around them, taking the long way, and most often doing it ourselves. We are boldly going where we haven’t been before because that is the way artists grow. We’re still growing. We hope you’ll journey with us as we continue to evolve and create new forms of audience-based work.

Risks & Challenges
Time is one of the biggest challenges we’ll face. PortFringe takes place from June 13–22 and our show opens on June 15, so we don’t have a huge amount of time to design this production and gather the materials necessary to make it shine. But we have proven many times before that we have the resources, ties within the community, and sheer determination to make impossible things happen. We’re confident that we’ll get it all done in time and on budget as we always have.
Though we call ourselves risk takers, there is very little risk that we won’t succeed in putting on a memorable show. That’s how we roll.

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Here at Hampstead, we know that the future is dependent upon the next generation.

Our aim isn't to inspire young adults to become artists (if so, great!)- We are hoping that exposure to theatre at this time in their life will help create an even more open-minded culture and nation.

<p>However, the Young Adult Series is an even bigger and bolder venture than creating our summer season. Instead of sticking with our same formula like we did in the Summer, we're breaking the mold by building a brand new style of set, adding sound for the first time, and venturing into a new venue: High Schools.</p>
<p>High Schools devote less money and time to the arts these days, which make performing at these venues difficult. This is why we need your help with donations, so we cut costs down for our shows and donate our shows to communities in need.   </p>

<p>This year marks Best Kind Productions’ seventh season and a truly exciting moment for our company: <strong>our first original musical in full production.</strong>  Kyle McDavid, founder and Co-Artistic Director of Best Kind Productions, started work several years ago on writing a musical about John Murray Anderson, a St. John’s native who went on to incredible success in theatre, including producing on Broadway.  After a reading at the LSPU Hall in December of 2015, a workshop at the Barbara Barrett Theatre in September of 2016, and months of development through Kyle fine-tuning the script and investigating and exploring in rehearsals with some of the area’s best musical theatre actors, we are bringing the world premiere production of <strong><i>Impresario</i></strong> to the stage at the LSPU Hall this May as a part of the RCA Presentation Series.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We couldn’t be more excited about sharing this production with an audience.  And as our first original musical, and being about such a brilliant individual, we want it to be as vibrant and bigger-than-life as it possibly can be, just like John Murray Anderson himself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In order to do that, we are seeking additional funding from generous supporters like you.  Your donation to our production will help us create a beautiful and exciting set; to rent high quality equipment to make this never-before-heard score sound fun and fantastic; and to engage for our production some of the area’s best and brightest actors, musicians, designers, and technicians.  Your generous donation will go directly towards making this show that exciting, energized, heartfelt, and hilarious story that we know it can be.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And your donation could come with some great perks, including autographed programs, posters, scripts, and even meet and greets with the cast and a behind-the-scenes look at rehearsals.</p>
<p>We hope you’ll consider helping us to make this show the brilliant, fully original theatrical experience we know it can be.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The show takes place May 18th -20th at the LSPU Hall, as part of the Resource Centre for the Arts season.  Tickets are available at <a href=""http://rca.nf.ca/event/impresario-2/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://rca.nf.ca/event/impresario-2/</a> or by calling the box office at 753-4531.</p>

<p>This is the first production of Milky Way Coffee Roasters, a new collaboration of young theatre makers in the Boston area. We hope to expand the limits of theatre being produced in the region, especially in regards to stories about diverse people and in the genres we explore on stage. Milky Way Coffee Roasters wants to see queer and femme bodies telling not just their own stories, but the stories that belong to all of us- stories of fantasy and horror that show us the things that could be real, whether in our dreams or nightmares. We have been given a wonderful opportunity by the Mosesian Center for the Arts to use the Black Box theater at a discounted rate in order to make this possible, but we still need your support to bring us over the finish line!<br/><br/>Find out more about all of our team on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/2266628356892083/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook!</a></p>
<p>Sloth Levine and Katie Grindeland both graduated from Emerson College in 2016 and have been working steadily in the Boston theatre scene. Levine is a director, writer, and designer who has worked with Stage Source on the Gender Explosion Initiative as an advocate for transgender and non-binary theatre makers and has been published on HowlRound and American Theatre. Grindeland is an actor, writer, designer, administrator, and teaching artist. You may have seen one or both of their work at Emerson Stage, SpeakEasy Stage Company, New York Theatre Workshop, Company One, American Repertory Theatre, Fresh Ink Theatre, New Repertory Theatre, Wheelock Family Theatre, or Brown Box Theatre Project. At Emerson College, the two collaborated on  a dark vaudevillian <i>James and the Giant Peach</i>, winning the 2016 EVVY Award for Best Theatrical Production, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress, and Best Lighting Design. <br/><br/>Theatre is often done entirely out of passion, because it's hard (which we love) and doesn't pay well (which is an institutional problem we don't love). Everyone helping us put this together are friends who want to do this project because they either want to see themselves represented, or they want to create something where they get to help redefine the rules. And they're agreeing to do so for the tiniest of stipends. We (Sloth and Katie) are acting as volunteers on this project, and not paying ourselves, so more can go to them. We are so grateful to our team, and want to help propagate the idea that young artists should not have their time and talent unfairly compensated. I can't tell you how many times we've taken work that pays in nothing or close to nothing, because it's what we've been told we have to do in order to get the paid work. But now we're in a position where we get to decide, and regardless of who you are you deserve to be paid, gosh darnit! Every donation you make not only helps pay our incredible team, but also signs you up to be a part of a movement where we work together to define what every artist deserves for their time and skills. </p>
</div><div>
<p>We've been lucky enough to receive a generous donation from the Bob Jolly Charitable Trust Fund, as well as an agreement with the space we're working in that will help us, no matter what, increase our artists' pay - your donations just help make it as equitable as possible. While ultimately this is a grassroots project, but Milky Way Coffee Roasters wants to be able to acknowledge the labor of all our artists as best we can, and the more support we receive the better we can do that. This production is almost entirely led by women and non-binary people who want to make an impact on theater in Boston. We believe it is important to start off our journey setting a precedent.</p>

<p><b><i>1915.  Brilliantly talented, young

antics of the Princeton Triangle Club, in pursuit of the beautiful and elusive
debutante Ginevra King.  Their romance inspired one of the greatest novels
of the 20th century...</i></b></p>
<p><span>Ginevra was Fitzgerald’s first love – the
girl who got away.  Many scholars agree she is the model for the character of Daisy Buchanan in <i>The Great Gatsby</i>.  As
Fitzgerald struggles to make a place for himself in Ginevra’s socially elite
world, gaining status by writing and performing with the Triangle Club, he grows
into his writer’s voice, mentored by his best friends and classmates, Edmund Wilson and John Peale Bishop, who also went on to become major literary figures. <br/></span></p>
<p><span>Combining
contemporary musical theater story-telling technique with a traditional palette
of early 20<sup>th</sup> century American song form and a strong dose of period
musical comedy, <i>The Underclassman</i> parallels
Fitzgerald’s story with a national coming-of-age narrative, as the country
leaves a period of naïve isolationism and enters into the global conflict of
World War I.  </span></p>

a time of near-constant arts cuts, Grassroots Shakespeare is turning
to the original practices of Elizabethan touring players to bypass
expensive ticket prices and funding bureaucracy to take Shakespeare
directly to audiences. This heady mix of professional actors with no
director, no crew, gender-blind casting, no ‘fourth wall’, using
only cue scripts and a few days rehearsal, peels back centuries of
theatre history and analysis to present the text in a fresh and
exciting way. The shows are not stuffy, self-important, or difficult
to understand. They're fast-paced, interactive events appealing to
audiences of all ages and backgrounds – accessible, original, and
fun!</font></font></font></p>

As part of the company's ethos it's important to Grassroots that the
experience of classical theatre (performed in any setting) can
provide an intimate viewing that a broad range of theatregoers can
enjoy. As a “pop-up theatre company” Grassroots aims to challenge
other companies by continually offering something new to their
audiences, albeit an interactive event prior to performance, a
musical version of the text (whereby the entire cast learnt to play
instruments in less than a few hours), performing in torrential rain
or a classical performance told through a qualified sign linguist in

Grassroots Shakespeare! </font></font></font><font color=""#000000""><font size=""2""><font>Best

connect to a contemporary society – both nationally and
internationally. This somewhat cosmopolitan edge on Shakespeare gave
room for so many different interpretations of the text and now with
an enormous following in the USA and their first four months in

THEIR ENORMOUS OPEN-AIR SUCCESS THIS SUMMER, 


THE
GRASSROOTS SHAKESPEARE COMPANY, LONDON IS BACK TO ANNOUNCE THE
OPENING OF THEIR INDOOR WINTER SEASON.




Grassroots
introduction to their winter season will be celebrated by a
histrionic party of events that aims to recreate an atmosphere
reflective of the Elizabethan era. In its secret show location;
complete with some period costume, candles, mulled wine and a homely
wood fire; this humble and family friendly event welcomes all to
celebrate one of Shakespeare's most farcical comedies in a
bespoke mock-Tudor setting. This interactive experience promises
to immerse its audience straight into 16th
Century London and guarantees a fun-filled evening unlike anything
Grassroots have offered before.




Following
its interactive performances in the East of London, Grassroots will
then support The Complete Works of William Shakespeare at The New Red
Lion Theatre in Islington. Presenting two exclusive late-night
performances, Grassroots will be providing a wonderfully intimate
in-house experience for all involved.

.......................................................................................................................................


'This
is the short and long of it...


In
a time of near-constant arts cuts, Grassroots Shakespeare is turning
to the original practices of Elizabethan touring players to bypass
expensive ticket prices and funding bureaucracy to take Shakespeare
directly to audiences. This heady mix of professional actors with no
director, no crew, gender-blind casting, no ‘fourth wall’, using
only cue scripts and a few days rehearsal, peels back centuries of
theatre history and analysis to present the text in a fresh and
exciting way. The shows are not stuffy, self-important, or difficult
to understand. They're fast-paced, interactive events appealing to
audiences of all ages and backgrounds – accessible, original, and
fun!




'As
good luck would have it...'


In
true Grassroots style, the script will be suitably abridged to help
deliver a well-rounded and coherent version of the play within an hour and a half.
As part of the company's ethos it's important to Grassroots that the
experience of classical theatre (performed in any setting) can
provide an intimate viewing that a broad range of theatregoers can
enjoy. As a “pop-up theatre company” Grassroots aims to challenge
other companies by continually offering something new to their
audiences, albeit an interactive event prior to performance, a
musical version of the text (whereby the entire cast learnt to play
instruments in less than a few hours), performing in torrential rain
or a classical performance told through a qualified sign linguist in
aid of The Shakespeare Festival 2012 – no task is too great for
Grassroots Shakespeare! Best
known for our comedic timing and outlandish characterisation we aim
to bring a merriness of all shapes and sizes to London for this
winter season. 





'Why,
then the world's mine oyster...'


Grassroots,
re-cast in London prior to the opening of A Midsummer Nights Dream,
August 2011, developed into a company now comprised of Brits,
Americans, a Canadian and a German. Importantly for them, creating a
diversity amongst the ensemble was fundamental if they were to
connect to a contemporary society – both nationally and
internationally. This somewhat cosmopolitan edge on Shakespeare gave
room for so many different interpretations of the text and now with
an enormous following in the USA and their first four months in
London opening to enormous success, they have every intention of
continuing their efforts to get Grassroots Shakespeare on the theatre
map and onto stages throughout the UK and Europe. 





So, why are we
here?


The thing that many people aren't
aware of with Grassroots Shakespeare is that we are a non-profit
organisation that exists without funding of any kind. Performing
solely with unpaid actors to a free audience we strive to bring live
classical performance to anybody willing to watch. Although,
communities have welcomed our work with open arms we still feel there
is an enormous market for our interactive and cultural events to be
performed on a larger scale. We want to stimulate and encourage
people of all generations, backgrounds and ages to enjoy our work and
feel inspired by the wholesome sense of community it brings.


How can your
donations help us?


Currently Grassroots
Shakespeare has a kitty of £0. Following the success of our open-air
summer production ""A Midsummer Nights Dream"" we were
offered over £1000 by our public audience to which we have paid
towards our residency this winter season. However, we are desperate
to immerse ourselves into the production in time for the Christmas
period and embark on a full scale event.


What we receive will pay towards our venue and costume hire, advertisement costs
(e.g. programmes, flyers, posters), audience refreshments and
hopefully if there's anything left a round of drinks for our actors!
Importantly for us we want to not only develop this performance, but
create a fund that can continue to develop the company and our plan
to maximise the interest for Shakespeare.




Who do we intend
to help?


One of our big plans
for 2012 includes a THEATRE IN EDUCATION TOUR. It would be wonderful
if part of the fund could support our campaign to get into schools
and educate children about the heritage of classical text and further
about how theatre and creativity can stimulate learning.


Alongside this, Grassroots Shakespeare believe whole-heartedly in supporting  others. One way we do this is by fundraising in support of our two chosen charities. 

Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research (c) and Myeloma UK (c). 

In this particular case the following breakdown applies:

FOR THE FIRST SET OF DONATIONS UP TO £500 10% WILL BE DONATED.

FOR THE SECOND SET OF DONATIONS UP TO £1000 20% WILL BE DONATED.

FOR EVERY DONATION RECEIVED AFTER THAT 30% WILL BE DONATED.

Each percentage will be equally split between THE TWO CHARITIES - so the more you give to us, the more we give to them!

To see more information on our chosen charities and the work we aim to do on their behalf please visit our Twitter account on: @grassrootsLON 


Please do not be put off by the donation total being recorded in American dollars, Grassroots Shakespeare London will receive all of your donations in BRITISH STERLING.





How much should
you donate?


Absolutely anything you can
afford. We are grateful to receive any financial support we can and
accept it with enormous gratitude.


NOTE: Each charitable
donation will be listed with thanks, in our programme and further on
our website. 
Please do not be put off by the donation total being recorded in American dollars, Grassroots Shakespeare London will receive all of your donations in BRITISH STERLING.

Women of Color Productions, Inc. is a non-for-profit company that produces, creates and presents new plays, classical plays, musicals, performance art pieces, film festivals and TV projects by or about Women of Color.  Our projects are multicultural and deal with the alternative political and cultural perspectives from the past, present and future.
The Women of Color Human Rights Theatre Project will present workshop productions of five one-act plays that deal with human rights issues from the perspective of characters who are women of color.  The three playwrights in our 2011 Playwright Development Program, Kristine M. Reyes, Jorshinelle Taleon-Sonza and Jacqueline Wade, began researching and writing their plays in April 2011 under the guidance of dramaturg Maxine Kern.
From the Philippines to Rwanda, Nazi Germany to New York City, these plays span time and place in order to shed light on the many injustices suffered by women of color throughout the world’s history.  While each story is unique, there is a common thread that proves the strength and resiliency of these women characters, even in the face of tremendous hardship.
Your contributions and support will help make this project a reality, and allow these untold stories to finally be heard. 
 
Performances are scheduled for: 
June 22-24 and June 29-July 1 (additional dates will be added)
 
Location:  Joria Productions Theatre
260 West 36th Street, 3rd Floor
New York, NY
 
THE PLAYS
 
Lena’s Way by Jorshinelle Taleon-Sonza
Lena’s Way is a story about first love in the time of Philippine martial law.  A young girl awakens to the wonders of first love in the midst of violence and chaos.  Her family sabotages that love, her loved one betrays her and what she does next surprises everyone, including herself. 
 
Triptych Knot by Jacqueline Wade
Triptych Knot is three short plays that explore what happens to women who are entangled and stuck in a web of unbearable situations when their human rights have been violated or taken away.  One woman is from Rwanda in, Mama Africa, another is from Nazi Germany in, Sterilization, and the third, Mary Theresa is stuck in the New York City Board of Education, ""rubber room.""   How do they find freedom and survive?
 
Lola Luning’s First Steps by Kristine M. Reyes
As Lola Luning’s worsening dementia causes the trauma of her young life in the Philippines during WWII to resurface, her granddaughter Gabriela struggles to uncover the whole story.  Meanwhile, Lola Luning’s daughter Virgie denies that what’s happening is anything more than the workings of a failing mind, exposing her inability to confront the truth about her own past.  Can Gabriela put together the pieces of her family’s history before Lola Luning falls deeper into dementia and their story is lost forever?

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Spontaneous Shakespeare Players is a group of professional independent theatre artists who bring the spontaneity and fun of Shakespeare's plays to modern audiences.  Shakespeare’s theatre was a theatre for the people, from monarch to groundling and everyone in between.  SSP strives to keep that tradition alive by entertaining people of all ages with powerful, engaging, and spontaneous performances.  By using Elizabethan performance techniques, which involve limited to no rehearsal, we give our audiences a historical taste of how Shakespeare's plays would have originally been performed and entertain audiences with the same moment-to-moment vivacity that made theatre the premier form of entertainment in Shakespeare’s day.</span><br/></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This year, in addition to providing free, live summer theatre in Central Park, we expanded our work to include educational programs.  We offer competitive and economical prices in order for schools to incorporate live arts programs into their curriculum during a time of drastic arts education budget cuts.

get the full experience of being involved with the exceptional plays the
writers created exclusively for Keen Teens. We will be presenting the shows in
an Off-Broadway production at the Clurman Theatre at Theatre Row from May
6-8th, and expect to continue our trend of selling out all five
performances.OUR SHOWSVIRTUAL CONGRESSWritten by Mike Lew; Directed by David F. ChapmanTHE FLIP SIDEWritten by Jenny Schwartz; Directed by Sarah Cameron SundeTHE BORING-EST POEM IN THE WORLDWritten by Greg Kotis; Directed by John ClancyOUR IMPACTThe impact of Keen Teens on students and drama teachers is
tremendous, and will grow with each year of our program. The students who
participate in our rehearsal process are the immediate beneficiaries. But
students across the United States are already also benefiting. The Playscripts
catalogue, which lists the plays along with a synopsis and production history,
is mailed to 40,000 recipients. This gives students and administrators all over
the world access to our plays for reading, acting class work and for production
and participation in Theatre Festivals. Playscripts also makes a large portion
of each script available through their online catalogue so teachers and actors
have the opportunity to read some of it before purchasing. To date, there have been 121 licensed performances of our plays and 1,720
copies of our scripts have been purchased by teachers and students at high
schools all across the globe, including the United States, Canada, New Zealand,
Japan, Australia, Germany, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland! That
means that approximately 15,480 students are working on Keen Teens plays.OUR STUDENTSDuring our casting process, we are committed to bringing
students from vastly different geographic, economic, and educational
backgrounds together. They come from Suffolk County to Rockland County, from
Jersey City to the Upper East Side to audition for our program. These are students
who ordinarily would not have met each other nor worked together at this point
in their lives. Some students have professional experience, and some have never
been in a play before. We continue to see that this diversity defines the heart
of the program. Teaching students that true theatre is about finding your own
voice and learning how to listen to someone and respond to them truthfully and
honestly continues to be our greatest goal each week.~Tickets to Keen Teens are now on sale and are only $18:

Or call us!</span></p></div>","WHAT IS PLAYBACK THEATRE?Playback is a unique form of improvised social change theater practiced in 50 countries around the world for community-building, conflict-resolution and celebration.  Volunteers from the audience share important moments from their lives, and actors instantly ""play back"" their stories using drama, dance, song, and music.
WHY IS PLAYBACK IMPORTANT?As seen by the ugliness of the recent elections, we live in a deeply divided country.  We believe Playback Theatre -- a form of embodied empathy -- can be a powerful tool in these times, helping to open peoples' hearts to each other across divides. “I want us to organize, to tell the personal stories that create empathy, which is the most revolutionary emotion.”  - Gloria Steinem EXAMPLES OF THE POWER OF PLAYBACK THEATREVirginia from Memphis Playback: We have honored stories of white and African-American people working together to stop youth violence in Memphis, the city where Dr. King was murdered.Anne-Liese from New Orleans Playback Theatre:  We have helped survivors of Katrina tell their deepest stories to heal and move their lives forward.Armand from Living Arts Playback Ensemble: We have helped descendants of Holocaust survivors and Nazis dialogue and transform their legacies of historical trauma into constructive action. LIGHT THE FIRE OF EMPATHY If you, too, want to help ignite empathy across divisions, please join our “30 Stories, 30 Days” campaign today. You will help Playback North America grow the powerful work of Playback ensembles such as the ones above.  The funds from this campaign will support us to:


Gather 30 powerful stories of how Playback Theatre has fostered healing or built bridges across painful social divides.  We’ll use these to initiate potential partnerships with activist groups working on these issues, as well as to promote the work of 76 Playback troupes across North America.


Increase effectiveness by interviewing Playback troupes that work on key timely social issues, including environmental action, immigration, anti-bullying in schools, cross-racial dialogue.  We’ll share the lessons learned via teleconferences, YouTube and more.  


Connect troupes working on common issues. We will then together seek foundation funding for multi-troupe projects where Playback’s healing power on specific issues can be amplified and documented.  


Collaborate on these endeavors with the Centre for Playback Theatre and the International Playback Theatre Network.

We see this as the first stage of a many-year project to build empathy and understanding across America’s chronic divisions through the engaging medium of Playback Theatre. HOW TO JOIN THE CAMPAIGN


Donate to Playback North America - help us raise $3,000 in 30 days.  Contributions are tax-deductible.


Spread hope.  Let your friends and colleagues know about this unique tool for building empathy. Share this page and encourage them to join the campaign.


Share your story. If you have experienced Playback’s power, please take ten minutes to write a few sentences about your experience on our Facebook page.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm entering a stage in comedy where I have the opportunity to travel to interesting places to perform, but the only way for comics like me to make a living on these performances is by selling merchandise as well. I believe recording an album is far more intimate and artistically satisfying than simply making a t-shirt to sell. </p>
<p>I also desperately need your attention and prefer to have it for 45 minutes. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<p>I'm aiming to raise $2500 which would cover the cost of some recording equipment, a sound engineer to record, mix, and master the album, and a distributor to print 1,000 copies of the album as well as make it available on iTunes, Amazon, and Spotify. Also, some of the money is taken by Indiegogo (about 7% I believe between their commission and PayPal transfer fees.)</p>
<p>Anyone who gives more than $25 receives a copy of the album, and take a look at the more specific perks to see what weird stuff you can get for greater donations. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute, that's completely OK. However, if you'll be in the New York area on May 22, I'd love for you to come to the recording at Union Hall in Park Slope, Brooklyn at 8 PM to laugh and support and, mainly, laugh. </p>
<p>Also, please spread the word about the fundraiser and the show! Forward this project to anyone you think might be interested in helping out. </p>
