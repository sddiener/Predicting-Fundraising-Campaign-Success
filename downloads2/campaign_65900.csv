<h3>This is how it all started</h3>
<p>My husband Kevin came to me when we had three small children and asked if we should abandon this idea we had for a home improvement tool because of the high cost of raising a family. We had a home made prototype we  were using and it worked great."" I told him if we didn't do it now we never would."" So we did!</p>
<p>Ten years later, six of those battling the U.S. Patent office an unscrupulous Patent Lawyer, multiple prototypes ( unique pour spout toughest), three more kids a new hip ( Kevin), a reputable manufacturer and mold maker, distribution channel WE ARE HERE!</p>
<p>The final push! We are inviting you to be part it! Less than 1% of people that set out to bring a product to market ever do. If you go to a Casino and play Black Jack you have a 10% chance of winning. Lets defy all the odds and make some great D.I.Y. projects come alive!   </p>
<p> </p>

</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

</div></div>","This is how it all started
My husband Kevin came to me when we had three small children and asked if we should abandon this idea we had for a home improvement tool because of the high cost of raising a family. We had a home made prototype we  were using and it worked great."" I told him if we didn't do it now we never would."" So we did!
Ten years later, six of those battling the U.S. Patent office an unscrupulous Patent Lawyer, multiple prototypes ( unique pour spout toughest), three more kids a new hip ( Kevin), a reputable manufacturer and mold maker, distribution channel WE ARE HERE!
The final push! We are inviting you to be part it! Less than 1% of people that set out to bring a product to market ever do. If you go to a Casino and play Black Jack you have a 10% chance of winning. Lets defy all the odds and make some great D.I.Y. projects come alive!   
 

What We Need & What You Get
Break it down for folks in more detail:

Our funding break down is this. $ 4500. goes to our initial manufacturing order.
$850. is for shipping to Chicago
$1200 is postal fulfillment/shipping to deliver the product to your door. 
$950 is for the final mold alterations and set up stamping fee.
We are confident that with so many different projects that there is many different demands for multiple Kits. We have assembled different packages to accommodate these demands. You may want more then one if you simply find yourself working with more than one color.  
All funds raised go to delivering your order. This Campaign is pre-order financing. This is not a donation. This is the end of an expensive and exhausting journey and we are asking for you to offer us some relief. All kits paid for will get delivered. 


The Impact
 

We really would love to have every supporter walk into a store one day and see that they were part of that finished product. That this product came alive with their help.
We have working samples as you can see. We want to stay in touch with our supporters and share finished projects.  
Our success will allow us to re approach Big Box and Mom and Pops with an inventory!  


Risks & Challenges
 We have been out at Vendor days, trade shows and such but without inventory we have been dead in the water, We needed to put together our packaging, color scheme and have samples in hand to get anyone to truly listen to us. This where your support comes in.  You are paramount!

We have a proven decades long passion toward this goal and want to see it through with you.
All the pieces are in place and again this is the final push.

  The LuDela story began in Uganda, where founder Jamie Bianchini was riding his tandem bicycle with a Ugandan friend named Innocent. Innocent shared his dream with Jamie tostart a school for AIDS orphans and those in need. Innocent’s community lacked access to books and opportunities to receive a fundamental education. Jamie promised to doeverything he could to help make Innocent's dream for his people a reality.  Later, in Burkina Faso, Jamie spent the night at a rustic guesthouse where he was given a candle as a light source. He accidentally fell asleep with the candle burning and woke up toa room filled with thick smoke from a candle fire. Luckily, he was able to put the fire outwith his boxer shorts and nobody was hurt. 
 As he rode his bike onwards the next day the inspiration for the LuDela Perfect came to him. After helping Innocent realize his dream for the Good Hope School in Uganda, Jamie was inspired to use the patented LuDela innovation as a vehicle to illuminate the minds of more children around the world by giving the empowering gift of literacy through the purchasesof LuDela candle products. This is Better Light, Better Lives. Join us!

<p>Anonabox seeks to provide Internet users with an affordable, easy-to-use and portable privacy device that is useable and practical for a wide range of Internet users. Anonabox PRO features both
Tor and VPN access. Whether used individually or together, users are provided with these robust tools configurable in a user interface for customizable personal
privacy. Privacy is a right, and intrusions by governments, websites, marketing firms and blackmail groups are encroaching on this freedom like never
before. Fight back with this special device.</p>
<p>Through this Indiegogo campaign, you can fight back against these intrusions, while supporting a legendary security advocate, John Draper. John has a storied life as a keystone figure of the Internet age. He is credited as a founding
personality of the hacker counter culture, been a long standing security and open source software advocate and remains an industry consultant. His unique position within these communities and the countless untold behind-the-scenes stories from his days as a phone phreaker and personal friend to Apple founders means his story will surely appeal to anyone interested in the early days of the Internet and computer systems. Your support will help ensure that ongoing expenses, like increasing medical bills, don't hamper John's efforts at publishing his many life stories. The more support for Project Blue, the more resources Mr. Draper will have to accomplish this goal of publishing his biography.</p>

While contacting Mr. Draper for a possible security audit of our new Anonabox devices, we learned that the Crunchman was becoming burdened by increasing medical expenses, and we saw a way to thank the man that had been such an inspiration.
Anonabox got its original push right here on Indiegogo and we’ve since developed three new privacy routers. Alongside our new devices we’re also launching a special limited edition blue Anonabox PRO in homage of John's famous blue boxes. A portion of the proceeds from this device will go directly to Mr. Draper to help ensure he can share his life's story. You can show your support for the Crunchman while receiving the most feature-rich Anonabox privacy router yet.
What We Need & What You Get
We feel Crunchman’s story is one of great interest for all information technology users and fans, so our goal is to help the Crunchman fund the development of his autobiography as much as we can. This is why we've chosen a flexible monetary goal.

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>We promise to do our absolute best to deliver Brik Tile on time and on spec. Fortunately, we've done this before. :) Our experience creating Brik Book means that we know how to bring a crowdfunded project to market.</p>
<p>Although we've already accounted for problems that might arise related to durability and hanging power, we also know that it may not always be smooth sailing. We won’t leave you ""hanging"".

Make Your Walls Interactive

We've been developing and prototyping these 10""x10"" Brik Tiles (patent pending) for over a year. Each Brik Tile is backed with a temporary adhesive and can be applied multiple times to almost any smooth surface. Unlike traditional baseplates, Brik Tiles can be attached next to each other directly (without the need for gaps or spacers).

 

Install in Seconds. Reuse Multiple Times.Not just for pixel art. Brik Tile can be used to organize cables, hang photos, display cards or virtually any type of small shelf. Apply at home or at the office!Use Brik Tile To Organize Your Home Or Office With Style!BriksWe're also developing new Briks. These new flat 1x1 Briks include a small ledge at the bottom for simple removal. Briks are perfect for creating pixel art designs on Brik Tile.New Briks with Bottom Removal LedgeBrik ClipsBrik Clips are perfect for hanging art work, photos, cables, keys and more. Every Indiegogo backer will receive a Brik Clip with every Brik Tile.Hang Keys, Photos, Cables and More.Structure KitThe Structure Kit includes enough 2x2, 2x4, 2x10, 1x4, and 1x6 building bricks to build any one of the following at a time (assorted colors):• Business Card Holder• Pen Holder• Small Shelf• Mail Holder• Sunglasses HolderBrik BuildUse BrikBuild.com to design your own pixel art or browse hundreds of popular designs submitted by other members of the Brik community. Brik Build automatically calculates what Briks you'll need and generates a downloadable PDF template.Design Online and Build At HomeBrik BookBrik Book MacBook CaseBrik Book was launched in March of 2015, and has been featured in Vanity Fair (Ultimate Gift of 2015), Oprah Magazine (Oprah's O-List), and others. Brik Book for Mac is available now. Brik Book for PC is coming soon and uses the same patent pending, temporary adhesive technology you'll find in Brik Tile.Why We're Raising MoneyWhile we've done extensive prototyping, the final version of Brik Tile and the new Briks will require special molds for the ABS plastic we'll be using. Raising money on Indiegogo will help pay for production-ready prototypes, molds, packaging, and the first order of Brik Tiles.Rewards

Risks and challenges
We promise to do our absolute best to deliver Brik Tile on time and on spec. Fortunately, we've done this before. :) Our experience creating Brik Book means that we know how to bring a crowdfunded project to market.
Although we've already accounted for problems that might arise related to durability and hanging power, we also know that it may not always be smooth sailing. We won’t leave you ""hanging"". We want to you be included in our process at every turn, as we continue to develop and deliver Brik Tile to you.

<h3>TO PROTECT YOUR PET</h3>
<p>Jumping on and off furniture can be dangerous. As the owner of a dachshund who underwent spinal surgery for a blown disc, I know this all too well. All it takes a misstep, rough play, a fall, or a harsh landing to cause long-lasting and expensive injuries to our pets. Why take the chance when something as simple as a ramp can greatly alleviate the likelihood of bad things happening?</p>
<p>But in creating a safer environment for your pets, you also shouldn't have to sacrifice the aesthetics of your living room, either! </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1575084247/sclexvb1bpbfwu09gliv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Even for the bigger dogs, who are shorter, elderly, disabled, or could just use an extra step up, a couch ramp can be beneficial for all types of dogs.</p>

<h3>WHAT KINDS OF DOGS IS THIS GOOD FOR?</h3>
<p>As our video and description stated, this ramp CAN work well for virtually any type of dog where they could benefit from a ramp. <strong>It is designed <i>more-so</i> for smaller dogs</strong>, since they are the main users of a bed ramp, and are most at risk from injury, including dachshunds, chihuahuas, corgis, pugs, etc. </p>
<p>Some medium and larger dogs who are shorter, like bulldogs, bassets, <strong>may also find it useful </strong>since they are, well, short... And for the big dogs, they too could use it in certain scenarios. Admittedly, most big dogs would NOT need a ramp, but as they get older and have arthritis or joint problems, or are disabled, then a ramp can definitely be of help.</p>

For Your Dog's Safety, and to Match Your Furniture!
UPDATE: our new couch ramps have all shipped and have been exceptionally well received by customers (yay!) And now, sales continue on our own website, so visit DoggoRamps.com to get YOUR couch ramp for YOUR dog! 

Following the successful launch of our revolutionary bed ramp which is now in the homes of over 5000 people, we are excited to present our re-imagined, re-invented, and if we do say so, incredible couch ramp!
We've combined ergonomic design, strength, functionality, and beautiful aesthetics. Because the best-functioning dog ramp shouldn't have to be an eyesore.. 


TO PROTECT YOUR PET
Jumping on and off furniture can be dangerous. As the owner of a dachshund who underwent spinal surgery for a blown disc, I know this all too well. All it takes a misstep, rough play, a fall, or a harsh landing to cause long-lasting and expensive injuries to our pets. Why take the chance when something as simple as a ramp can greatly alleviate the likelihood of bad things happening?
But in creating a safer environment for your pets, you also shouldn't have to sacrifice the aesthetics of your living room, either! 

Even for the bigger dogs, who are shorter, elderly, disabled, or could just use an extra step up, a couch ramp can be beneficial for all types of dogs.

 
THE SPECS:


Adjustable height from 14"" to 21"", with 4 slot adjustments.
Completely collapsible to less than 3"" tall when folded flat.
Featuring our unique PAWGRIP anti-slip surface for unprecedented traction.
Holds over 150lbs.
Comes in 5 beautiful colors.
Made of furniture-grade hardwood.
100% made in North America.

 
DIMENSIONS & HEIGHTS:

COLORS:

 
WHAT KINDS OF DOGS IS THIS GOOD FOR?
As our video and description stated, this ramp CAN work well for virtually any type of dog where they could benefit from a ramp. It is designed more-so for smaller dogs, since they are the main users of a bed ramp, and are most at risk from injury, including dachshunds, chihuahuas, corgis, pugs, etc. 
Some medium and larger dogs who are shorter, like bulldogs, bassets, may also find it useful since they are, well, short... And for the big dogs, they too could use it in certain scenarios. Admittedly, most big dogs would NOT need a ramp, but as they get older and have arthritis or joint problems, or are disabled, then a ramp can definitely be of help.

 Samurai Steels: Jealously guarded finishes exclusive to HinokiFor three years now we’ve been making a carbon-steel blade, the S1 Gyuto, a knife that has gained a cult following, finding a home in the kitchens of some of the world’s top chefs.Forged by the master bladesmiths of Sakai using techniques and traditions passed through generations, the S1 Gyuto is a knife steeped in history, of superlative detail and exceptional sharpness.Taking what we’ve learnt from the S1 Gyuto we’re creating knives for every kitchen, The Essentials. Unbound by limitation, unmatched in quality.Sharpness is inherent through our signature convex blade, tensile strength achieved with our hardening process and edge-retention unmatched in our proprietary finished VG-10 steel.    The City of Blades, Seki, JapanAll Hinoki Essentials are crafted in the home of Japanese sword-smithing, the town of Seki, a place that has been known for centuries as ‘The City of Blades’.Here our factory sits amongst rice paddies and crystal streams, commanded by President Kawamura, whose family have been members of a legendary craftsmanship guild for over 400 years, a guild that was started by 16th-century Samurai Swordsmith, Naoe Kanetsugu.A Hinoki knife is not only a world-class kitchen knife but also a piece of proud Japanese tradition. The culmination of hundreds of years of swordsmithing into knives made for your kitchen.    
Leave your mark, fully customised to you Fully customisable to your preferences, each of our three blades comes in your choice of two proprietary finishes specially rendered for Hinoki - Brushed Chrome or our signature Obsidian Black oxide finish.Crowned by a bolster in matching finish, your handle in deep ebony or tactile walnut, and your initials discreetly etched to the blade, each knife is truly yours and yours alone.       A revolutionary convex bladeThrough years of exploration and testing, President Kawamura has developed his signature Hamaguri-ba or Convex Blade.A blade profile of exquisite sharpness and edge retention, made using a trade-secret unique to his process, the hallmark Convex shape allows for the cleanest cut with every stroke, ensuring ingredients aren’t damaged through the cutting process and flavours are locked in.On the Chef’s Knife this proprietary shape has been applied to not one, but three layers of VG10 steel. Sharpened through a process refined over generations, these are knives of pedigree.      

Serrations that don’t leave a tracePersonally laboured over by President Kawamura, each serration is pitched and troughed to exacting angles forming a truly modern, incomparable bread knife.Tested through untold loaves of sourdough, it slices through bread without tearing the crust and carves meat and poultry and even the toughest artichoke as if they were butter.   V Gold 10, the Core of HinokiSitting at the pinnacle of chef-grade stainless steels, unsurpassed in rust resistance and peerless in edge retention, VG10 was the only choice for Essential blades.Distilled from a combination of Carbon, Chromium and several other metals, VG-10 Steel with a Rockwell Hardness rating of 61, it is at once both durable and malleable, truly the gold standard. 
 HRC 61: A Rockwell hardness rating of 61 - incredibly durable, exquisitely sharp
 Incredibly Rust Resistant: Used in the world’s best kitchens, time and time again
 Effortless to resharpen: Superior edge-retention, both malleable and durable
 Sub-zero quenched to provide superb edge sharpness and retention 
 
A Hamon, unique to you In homage to the Katana from which the essentials owe so much, each blade features a unique pattern or Hamon (刃文, Ha meaning blade and Mon pattern).Born from our sub-zero quenching and tempering process,  the blade and distinct to Japanese knives, the Hamon on each Hinoki is individual to that knife and that knife alone.     Deep Obsidian BlackTo achieve our signature Obsidian Black oxide finish each knife goes through a special chemical conversion oxidation process, smoothing the face of each knife and finishing it in brilliant, lustrous black.As a result, the blade has better corrosion resistance, reduced friction and a look and feel distinct to the Hinoki Essentials.    Angles Of Utility and PaceThe K-Tip Nose adds manoeuvrability and precision when scoring proteins and vegetables. Used in fast-paced kitchens the world over a K-Tip means you can cut with confidence and pace. Perfect Handling,  An Extension Of YouInspired by Wa handle silhouettes, Essential handles blend modern ergonomics with traditional Japanese wood carving, bringing a lighter weight and a blade-forward balance disposition.In a choice of either sustainably harvested Ebony or tactile American Walnut farmed from regenerative forests in Missouri, both luxuriously polished and finished. Authenticity is in the DetailTexture in wood and steel, finish accented through polish, the detailing on each Hinoki Essential is crowned on the collar and blade with the Hinoki 三十 and H discreetly etched,  authenticity is in the detail.     Legacy Knife: The Eternal GuaranteeAll Hinoki Knives come with a commitment to a lifetime of service, a commitment that any product we create should outlast its owner.If you are at all not satisfied with the performance of your Hinoki, if the blade becomes dull or the handle is worn, we’ll make it right. In any circumstance, we commit our knives to a lifetime of performance, like new, forever.With this sentiment, The Hinoki Eternal Commitment is yours to define, satisfaction with your product being yours and yours alone. 
What owners are saying about their Hinoki 
 
Anatomy of The Essentials 
The E1 Bread KnifeMaking light work of even the toughest materials, think artichokes, meat, poultry, the E1 Bread Knife goes beyond carbohydrates.It’s unique geometric form and painstakingly tested pitched and troughed serration make for a tool that is stunningly aesthetic and without match in its class.   The E1 Chef’s KnifeAn iconic silhouette based on the Santoku blade profile, more than an all-rounder this is an indispensable partner in the kitchen.Japanese for three virtues, Santoku, is a reference to the knife’s versatility in cutting fish, meat and vegetable, the first and last knife you will reach for.  The E1 Paring KnifeUtility, detailing. Designed to deftly peel, mince and intricately decorate all matter of fruit, vegetables and aromatics. An all-purpose knife, for work that takes ten minutes or two hours.  Worthy CompanionsRequisite storage in the finest vegetable tanned leather, protect your E1 Bread or Chef’s Knife with the hand-stitched Companion Sheath.A combination of two-high quality abrasive grits - the grey coarse grit for sharpening, the white for honing and polishing. A matchless way to keep Hinoki Steel prepared, The Companion Whetstone.      Our story and purposeHinoki is both a reaction and a catalyst. A response to mass-consumerism and a blueprint for how brands can fully reject the disposable culture that has come to define the 21st century.Our obsession for fighting mass-consumption takes many forms - our desire to keep dying craftsmanship alive, our inclination to question process across every facet of the product life cycle, our simple need to rationalize your life. Illustrations by Liam Collod @monsierlixmThe Hinoki Team",38.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We created the “Make It Your Banner” to bring to the world a truly unique way to commemorate special events. Every other party banner we came across was just generic and plain. There were options out there to create custom banners but they were expensive and not as fun. So we decided to fix that!

<p>EcoBreeze 2 improves on these savings in two revolutionary two ways. First, its hyper-efficient motor and fan draws 75% less energy than traditional window fans; next, by implementing its patented SmartFan technology that maximizes cooling with outside air and minimizes energy use.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What’s so smart about EcoBreeze 2?</strong></h3>
<p>We at Nature’s Cooling Solutions are firm believers in brains over brawns. By continuously <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522877261/xezvbxbpil4jcgxfwvdy.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>monitoring indoor and outdoor temperatures, sensing humidity and determining when and how much fresh, free, filtered air to draw into the home at precisely the right time, our <u>EcoBreeze 2 us</u><u>es about the same energy as an LED light bulb</u>.</p>
<p>The entire cooling process is automated, so operating the fan is as easy as setting a thermostat. Simply set your home thermostat to your normal setting, then set EcoBreeze 2’s thermostat to a lower setting. The larger the difference between the two settings the greater the savings. It’s that simple!</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Let’s Crunch the Numbers!</strong></h3>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522878562/eyfm96ailfz9cbv640g2.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></strong>While potential savings are affected by climate zone, local power rates, and desired temperature, the MINIMUM estimated cooling-related energy savings is 30% with the majority of the United States estimated to save well over 70%. The table shows the potential savings for EcoBreeze 2 over different regions.            </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>                                       </strong><strong>EcoBreeze 2 Quickly Pays for Itself!</strong></p>
<p>EcoBreeze 2 provides such significant energy savings that many units will quickly pay for themselves. Units installed in hot cities like Los Angeles will return their full costs in less than a year. Even colder cities like New York, where air conditioners are used only intermittently, require little over a year to fully return their investments.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>       Cooling savings and Payback </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522880310/d4g6mggcogbdmlkkogpd.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Additional AC Savings - Less Repairs and Longer Life </strong>There are many fringe benefits to owning an EcoBreeze 2, including the fact that it will significantly extend the lifespan of your existing air conditioner. Central air conditioners can cost thousands to replace and hundreds to maintain each year. By reducing how often and how long your existing air conditioner’s compressor runs, it will see an increased lifespan and will last much longer between service calls.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Savings – Avoid cooling unoccupied rooms  </strong>Most single-family homes in the United States have central HVAC systems that condition all rooms at one time. However, many of these rooms are rarely used or go unoccupied for several days at a time. EcoBreeze provides individual room cooling and reduces the cost of cooling unoccupied rooms.  EcoBreeze 2 also allows you to focus your cooling efforts on the spaces that you use the most, so the coolest, most comfortable rooms will be the ones you spend the most time in.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Carbon &amp; Noise Reduction</strong></h3>
<p>Less energy means less waste. Since the EcoBreeze 2 can potentially reduce your home cooling energy usage by an outstanding 90%, your carbon footprint will reduce linearly. And if your air conditioner is running less frequently, the noisy, industrial fans attached to them will no longer be a bother to you and your neighbors.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Incredible Filtration!</strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525726693/iad6icwdblobie4vviqc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>EcoBreeze 2 delivers free, cool, filtered air directly into your home to flush out stale air. But not all filters are created equally. Our optional MERV-13 filter is so fine, so highly engineer that it even traps viruses and bacteria. Smog, smoke and dust will be eliminated from you living space, allowing you to relax in the freshest, coolest, healthiest air your home has ever known.  Our standard MERV 8 filter does a great job at removing pollen, dust mites and mold spore providing clean fresh cooling.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">How does EcoBreeze 2 sync with AC</h3>
<p>The answer lies in our comfort zone.   When we get too hot our bodies start to perspire so we turn on our air conditioner temperature to avoid this zone.  When we get too cold we reach for sweaters or blankets.  The difference between these temperatures is known as our comfort zone.   </p>
<p><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523387681/eji5oclczprqkogmfsz9.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>When EcoBreeze 2 and air conditioning are used together they have different functions.  The AC’s job is to avoid entering the TOO WARM zone.  The job of EcoBreeze 2 is to maximize the use of outside air to lower the room temperature to just above the TOO COLD zone.   In practice it’s really simple.  Set the ac temperature toward the high end of your comfort level.  Set the EcoBreeze 2 temperature at the low end of the comfort level.   When there is cool air outside the EcoBreeze 2 SmartFan technology will automatically take over to efficiently lower the room temperature.  When the outdoor air is too hot or humid the ac will kick on to avoid the TOO WARM zone.  </p>
<p>WARNING!  This could create a new thermostat war!   Increasing the difference between the two set points will increase savings.  Everyone will have to agree on the comfort zone or you can just do a stealth adjustment to have it your way! </p>

<p>“Sure you could do this yourself without this fan. Just stand around measure and wait for the moment outside air be cooler and less humid than indoors and open the window, install a fan turn it on then wait just in case it warms back up so you can close it all up... The EcoBreeze does it all for you the instant it should nothing more nothing less.” Aaron. EcoBreeze owner. </p>
<p>“We couldn't be happier with our Eco Breeze purchase. Now that the Arizona summer is fading, we use our Eco Breeze daily. We spend the majority of our time in our family room. Instead of running the A/C which is trying to cool the entire house, we run the Eco Breeze and only expend energy in the room we spend our time. We've seen a huge reduction in our electric bills”. Shaunna. Eco Breeze owner.  </p>
<p>“I own two units and plan on slowly getting three more for our bedrooms. We live in St. Louis MO, where it's very hot and humid during the summer and they do kick on at night even in those conditions. It's like the sound of money I'm saving when they turn on!

EcoBreeze 2 Energy Reports
How much can you save?
The United State Energy Information Administration’s “Annual Energy Outlook” for 2018 confirms that space cooling is the most costly, electricity-eating aspect of maintaining a home. EcoBreeze 2 rethinks the game by relying on one simple fact: cooling our houses with free outdoor air uses 98% less energy than creating it with an air-conditioner.
EcoBreeze 2 improves on these savings in two revolutionary two ways. First, its hyper-efficient motor and fan draws 75% less energy than traditional window fans; next, by implementing its patented SmartFan technology that maximizes cooling with outside air and minimizes energy use.
What’s so smart about EcoBreeze 2?
We at Nature’s Cooling Solutions are firm believers in brains over brawns. By continuously monitoring indoor and outdoor temperatures, sensing humidity and determining when and how much fresh, free, filtered air to draw into the home at precisely the right time, our EcoBreeze 2 uses about the same energy as an LED light bulb.
The entire cooling process is automated, so operating the fan is as easy as setting a thermostat. Simply set your home thermostat to your normal setting, then set EcoBreeze 2’s thermostat to a lower setting. The larger the difference between the two settings the greater the savings. It’s that simple!
Let’s Crunch the Numbers!
While potential savings are affected by climate zone, local power rates, and desired temperature, the MINIMUM estimated cooling-related energy savings is 30% with the majority of the United States estimated to save well over 70%. The table shows the potential savings for EcoBreeze 2 over different regions.            
 
 
                                       EcoBreeze 2 Quickly Pays for Itself!
EcoBreeze 2 provides such significant energy savings that many units will quickly pay for themselves. Units installed in hot cities like Los Angeles will return their full costs in less than a year. Even colder cities like New York, where air conditioners are used only intermittently, require little over a year to fully return their investments.
       Cooling savings and Payback 

 
Additional AC Savings - Less Repairs and Longer Life There are many fringe benefits to owning an EcoBreeze 2, including the fact that it will significantly extend the lifespan of your existing air conditioner. Central air conditioners can cost thousands to replace and hundreds to maintain each year. By reducing how often and how long your existing air conditioner’s compressor runs, it will see an increased lifespan and will last much longer between service calls.
Additional Savings – Avoid cooling unoccupied rooms  Most single-family homes in the United States have central HVAC systems that condition all rooms at one time. However, many of these rooms are rarely used or go unoccupied for several days at a time. EcoBreeze provides individual room cooling and reduces the cost of cooling unoccupied rooms.  EcoBreeze 2 also allows you to focus your cooling efforts on the spaces that you use the most, so the coolest, most comfortable rooms will be the ones you spend the most time in.
Carbon & Noise Reduction
Less energy means less waste. Since the EcoBreeze 2 can potentially reduce your home cooling energy usage by an outstanding 90%, your carbon footprint will reduce linearly. And if your air conditioner is running less frequently, the noisy, industrial fans attached to them will no longer be a bother to you and your neighbors.
Incredible Filtration!

EcoBreeze 2 delivers free, cool, filtered air directly into your home to flush out stale air. But not all filters are created equally. Our optional MERV-13 filter is so fine, so highly engineer that it even traps viruses and bacteria. Smog, smoke and dust will be eliminated from you living space, allowing you to relax in the freshest, coolest, healthiest air your home has ever known.  Our standard MERV 8 filter does a great job at removing pollen, dust mites and mold spore providing clean fresh cooling.
 
How does EcoBreeze 2 sync with AC
The answer lies in our comfort zone.   When we get too hot our bodies start to perspire so we turn on our air conditioner temperature to avoid this zone.  When we get too cold we reach for sweaters or blankets.  The difference between these temperatures is known as our comfort zone.   
When EcoBreeze 2 and air conditioning are used together they have different functions.  The AC’s job is to avoid entering the TOO WARM zone.  The job of EcoBreeze 2 is to maximize the use of outside air to lower the room temperature to just above the TOO COLD zone.   In practice it’s really simple.  Set the ac temperature toward the high end of your comfort level.  Set the EcoBreeze 2 temperature at the low end of the comfort level.   When there is cool air outside the EcoBreeze 2 SmartFan technology will automatically take over to efficiently lower the room temperature.  When the outdoor air is too hot or humid the ac will kick on to avoid the TOO WARM zone.  
WARNING!  This could create a new thermostat war!   Increasing the difference between the two set points will increase savings.  Everyone will have to agree on the comfort zone or you can just do a stealth adjustment to have it your way!

Customer Feedback
“Sure you could do this yourself without this fan. Just stand around measure and wait for the moment outside air be cooler and less humid than indoors and open the window, install a fan turn it on then wait just in case it warms back up so you can close it all up... The EcoBreeze does it all for you the instant it should nothing more nothing less.” Aaron. EcoBreeze owner. 
“We couldn't be happier with our Eco Breeze purchase. Now that the Arizona summer is fading, we use our Eco Breeze daily. We spend the majority of our time in our family room. Instead of running the A/C which is trying to cool the entire house, we run the Eco Breeze and only expend energy in the room we spend our time. We've seen a huge reduction in our electric bills”. Shaunna. Eco Breeze owner.  
“I own two units and plan on slowly getting three more for our bedrooms. We live in St. Louis MO, where it's very hot and humid during the summer and they do kick on at night even in those conditions. It's like the sound of money I'm saving when they turn on! They are ideal for warm spring and fall days in our area, but they absolutely help in the summer as well”. M. Eco Breeze owner.",12.0,1,"1 Campaign

The device itself is is a so called IoT device (Internet-of-Things) which connects with your wifi and is controlled via free mobile application.</p><h2>• How does it work:</h2><p>If the device is turned on and detects a movement in your home it will blast the siren and send a notification to the owner on his smartphone. The owner can easily connect his neighbors, friends and family to his device so they will also be notified if the alarm goes on.</p><h2>• How do I turn it on/off:</h2><p>You control it via the app.</p><h2>• Does it work with all smartphones:</h2><p>Currently it works with iOS and Android.</p><h2>• How many neighbors can I connect to my device:</h2><p>There is no limit on how many friends, family members and neighbors you can add.</p><h2>• Why should I add my neighbors:  </h2><p>Because your neighbors can react much quicker than anybody else. We don’t encourage people to confront an intruder themselves but merely to contact the authorities if he witnesses a break-in. If the intruder is not cached at the scene of the crime, your neighbor could help to provide valuable informations to the authorities.</p><h2>• Can I recharge the batteries:</h2><p>To cut down the production cost we decided not to have Fynoti with re-chargeable batteries. Meaning the end-user can get it for a better price.</p><h2>• What type of batteries does it use:</h2><p>Fynoti uses 3 x C batteries, which can be bought in most, if not all supermarket. We will also offer our backers to buy Fynoti with batteries included. The batteries will last up to a year.</p><h2>• Is there a camera in Fynoti:</h2><p>No, in this first version of Fynoti there will be no camera. We wanted to build a basic security solution that everybody, or at least most people, could afford and could use to add extra security in their lives. Adding camera would increase the production cost thus the price to the end-users.</p><h2>• Will my pet trigger the alarm:</h2><p>It depends on two factors; The size of your pet and where you place your Fynoti. You can manually adjust the signal strength on the device so if you have pets we recommend that you place your Fynoti somewhere they are least present and adjust the signal strength until it doesn’t get triggered.  </p><h2>• How many Fynoti’s can I have:</h2><p>We can’t say unlimited as we haven’t tested it :)..But you can have as many as you need. Unless you live in a palace you will hardly ever need more than 5-6 pcs.</p><h2>• Can I stick Fynoti on the wall or seiling:</h2><p>No you cannot. It needs to sit on a flat surface.</p><h2>• Can everybody in my home have access to Fynoti:</h2><p>Yes you can give them access via the app, they will need to have the Fynoti app installed on their smartphone.</p><h2>• How much area does one Fynoti cover:</h2><p>Detection range up to 12 meters (39 ft.) and 130° detection capability. With adjustable settings.</p><h2>• My neighbors don’t have Fynoti, can I still use it:</h2><p>Yes you can. It will work as most other home alarm system, if it’s triggered the siren will go on and you will get notified on your smartphone.</p><h2>• How many covers will there be to choose from:</h2><p>30+ different styles and colors. You will choose the cover in a survey after the campaign ends.</p><h2>• What the heck is F.E.R.N:</h2><p>It stands for Fynoti’s Emergency Response Network. It’s basically the community of Fynoti users.</p><h2>• How does Shout! work:</h2><p>When you click on Shout! the first time, you will be asked to add your address. After that you can choose from what area you would like to receive Shouts from. You can choose for example a radius of 100 meters. If somebody sends a Shout within that 100 m radius you will automatically get that Shout. Shouts made outside that radius you will not receive.</p><h2>• Can I use Shout! outside my neighborhood:</h2><p>Absolutely! You can send Shouts from anywhere. If you live in Berlin and are located in Paris you can still send Shouts. Your Shout gets sent out to people that has chosen to receive Shouts in the area you are currently located in. So even if you are not in your neighborhood you can still help other people keep their neighborhood safe.</p><h2>• How does Panic! Work:</h2><p>The first time you visit Panic! in the app you will be asked to insert your name and profile picture. You can add some additional information if you like, that could for example be information about allergy, medications that you need and where you store them, anything that could help people react quicker in case of emergency. If you press the Panic button a message will be sent out to Fynoti users closest to your location as well as all people that are on your friends list. That message includes all the information you added when creating your Panic profile, along with your current location.</p><h2>• Why do I need to have a profile picture in my Panic profile:</h2><p>The reason for having a profile picture is for people to recognise you. People that will come to the rescue might not know you and therefore they will need to know how the person they will be looking for looks like.</p><h2>• Can I use Panic! everywhere:</h2><p>Yes you can.</p><h2>• Is Fynoti waterproof? </h2><p>Do you live in Atlantis? No? Then why the heck you want it to be waterproof?</p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7wP7Nst6mRBODViVENaTVdGRGs"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509641988/toutl8qrcafeurpmifd2.png"" src=""""/></a></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Profunders-Club-1772169793092550/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1512653138/ar0s3542radefevhiqte.jpg"" src=""""/></a></p></div>","Join Us On

Everybody has one and NOBODY likes it! To us, they are the enemy. That’s why we invented VaBroom!No more annoying dustpan lines or bending over. With VaBroom, just sweep into a pile or line. Then tilt to the side, and the the pressure activated switch on the nozzle turns on the vacuum power! That's right, just suck up dirt and debris and then drop it in the trash.It's that easy! Just Sweep, Suck and SEE YA! VaBroom is lightweight, but POWERFUL!  So we ask ourselves, will it suck?          Step 1.  Sweep Step 2.  Suck Step 3.  Eject into trash. See-ya! 
  Overview:CapacityVaBroom can hold approximately 1 cup of debris at a time. That's about 2,367 Rice Krispies®! Power SourceVaBroom is powered by four (4)-AA batteries. On average, get over 500 uses per charge!Motor and ImpellerVaBroom boasts a 14,000 RPM motor with specially designed impeller to create powerful suction while remaining lightweight.

  Our Design Challenge: Create a lightweight cleaning tool with built-in powerful suction, that effectively eliminates the need for a dustpan.   
 Product Testing:  The nozzle design evolved from sequential testing to maximize suction and ease of use.  Additionally, we tested numerous combinations of motors, impellers and power sources to dial-in the best solution while keeping VaBroom lightweight.  Refinement:  Once the proper function was achieved by our engineers, our industrial design team then completed an iterative approach at refining VaBroom.  Customer surveys were completed with hundreds of participants and improvements were developed based on direct feedback from the user.  
 Form and Function:The last step was to make VaBroom beautiful.  Now that function had been maximized, we wanted to give VaBroom a modern, sleek look -- again, based on feedback from hundreds of users, we arrived at our current colorways, textures and finish.

It smartly irrigates and provides nutrition to vegetables and herbs. Verdeat is an app-controlled system which is self-sustainable for 1-3 weeks. The amount of water, energy and nutrients used is adjusted precisely to the needs of the plants, without an unnecessary waste.The system consists of modular trays with slots to plant the seeds along with a soil-free natural substrate (e.g. coconut fibre). Its unique universality and modularity also allow the growth of regular soil-based pot plants and microgreens.  Verdeat is manufactured in EU with 95% recycled materials. With each purchase we will plant a tree and  give you 3 tree seeds to cultivate in Verdeat and then plant in your neighborhood as a way of giving back to nature.  Each unit (size L) is made from plastic waste weighing 10kg / 22lbs.    TeamWe’re the team that created DitoGear.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We've been concerned about security in apartments and homes with patio doors and sliding windows. We designed a device that can be retrofit to ANY sliding patio door or window (vertical OR horizontal) to allow the door or window to be SECURELY locked in ANY open position, from LESS THAN ONE INCH to wide open, anywhere in between.  Our <b>PATENT PENDING</b> lock also adds extra security when the door or window is completely closed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is
that while burglaries take place throughout the year, according to security
officials, most areas in the country see a significant spike in crime from
November through January during the holiday season. And since most thieves want
to be in and out of your home in six minutes or less, anything you can do to
slow them down, or deter them entirely, will work in your favor.<b> 23% of home
burglaries take place through first floor windows and patio doors.</b></p>
<p>In most cases, burglars who
cannot gain access to a home in under two minutes will just give up and move
onto the next vulnerable target. </p>
<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We require $25,000.00 to complete our migration from limited, to full production, with commercial packaging, to help bring our product to local retailers. Our goal is to move from small machine shop production, to a more commercial mould and die produced unit.  Even if we don't reach our funding goal to advance our production model, we will be able to deliver your lock based on current production.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Why shouldn't you feel safe in your own home and have your patio doors and windows open a little.....EVERYONE can feel secure with having their windows or patio doors open a few inches. In apartments and homes, these units can easily be installed at ANY height on patio doors, up high or down low! This is also a safety device, particularly in apartments. Every year we hear of children falling out of apartment windows. With our security device in place, your home will be safer for you AND your children!</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Pre-orders will be accepted, the final product will cost $69.00 for the smaller  window sizes and $89.00 for full size patio doors. What is YOUR security and peace of mind worth to you and your family?</p>

Its like having a remote control from a thousand miles away.   Easily scroll through photos with the knobIf you want to go back a photo or show someone an old favorite all you need to do is turn the large knob on the side of Loop to flip like photos like an old rolodex.  Switch to a different photo channel with the other knobLoop organizes your photos and videos into channels. For a change of pace you can switch channels by turning the small knob under the scroll knob.  Loop automatically goes to sleep at nightWhen your days over Loop will automatically dim the screen at night or turn off completely at a scheduled time to prevent light glare and conserve power.     Your family's privacy is something we respect. Everything you share on Loop is private by default and only gets shared to family members you choose to add. Photos are stored and backed up in the cloud so if anything should happen to either your Loop or your phone, there’s no need to worry.    

 

 

 
 
     The idea for Loop was born several years ago when Brian’s son Alex was born. He was living in San Francisco with his new family and trying to stay connected with his parents who live on the east coast in Boston and Florida. When his father became ill, it really hit home. But all the alternatives had problems - social media was too public, half the family was on Apple, the other on Android and we still needed to email pictures to grandma. It was a mess. So the team created Loop. This isn’t our first rodeoOur first Loop did over $1m in sales and shipped to thousands of families around the world. In fact, some people told us that it changed their lives. We have wrapped all the learnings from that development to deliver our second generation Loop. It’s faster, cooler and has so many more features. It is better and cheaper and you get it in just a few weeks!  A team you can trust to deliver",55.0,3,"1 Campaign

Adap.Table legs make it possible to turn any flat surface into a table. Just tighten the legs onto the surface using the clamping mechanism and you have a table. Easy to assemble and disassemble, Adap.Table provides you with the freedom to create your own personal space, and fits perfectly into a flexible and personalized lifestyle. 





 



Our simple and elegant Adap.Table legs enable you to freely match sculptural table legs with any new or recycled table top, individualizing the heart of your working and living spaces at ease. Made of robust steel, each set of legs can support over 100kg or 220lbs; more than enough for working at home, having a meal, or making what you love! 
Currently we have two legs we want to put into production. 
Here’s a little more about them:

This table leg fits snugly around the corner of a table. Strong and sturdy, the triangular top-plate tapers down to create sleek legs that, when combined with a surface, create a striking table.





Dimensions: 14 × 4 × 75cm  (5.5"" × 1.6"" × 2' 5.5"")
Weight: 1.7kg  (3.75lbs)
Material: Powder coated steel
Color: Black








This folded leg takes its inspiration from a ribbon, wrapping the corners of your table like the awesome gift it is. Ribbon creates a table that looks light and easy, but provides you with all the support you need.





Dimensions: 8 × 8 × 75cm (3.1"" × 3.1"" × 2' 5.5"")
Weight: 2.1kg (4.63lbs)
Material: Powder coated steel
Color: Black





 It couldn't be any easier. A little twist of the screw and that's it, your table is ready!

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET</h2>
<p>Through crowdfunding we’re giving you the chance to be one of the world’s first owners of Olly. You’ll not only get to experience the first robot with a personality, with lifetime free Olly system upgrades, you’ll also be playing a part in shaping the future of Olly itself. More importantly, you will be involved in creating a new world of AI and encouraging our society to embrace this new technology.  </p>
<p>We’re looking for owners who’ll give us updates on their life with Olly, helping us to ensure every Olly is as uniquely brilliant as possible.</p>
<p>Olly can’t wait to meet you and empower your daily life.  </p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">IMPACT</h2>
<p>Emotech’s mission is to improve the relationship between humans and technology. Which is where you come in. We’re giving tech-lovers the technology to help make this happen. By becoming a proud owner of Olly, you can help us to create a better product and shape the future of Olly's development.</p>
<p>We want Olly to be an open platform. The more people who use Olly, the better Olly will become. We want our developers to have some fun with this project too, challenging them to create new software and hardware that pushes the existing boundaries of technology.To increase Olly’s skillset, we seek more talents from AI, design, voice and sound innovation and the medical field.</p>
<p>As a start-up, there’s a rebellious spirit that runs throughout Emotech. We’re looking for backers who share that spirit. Those who want to disrupt the ‘expected’ and help us create a more diverse AI world.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">RISKS AND CHALLENGES</h2>
<p>There are risks with production at every step of the way, but luckily for you, we've done all the hard work of getting a product through the tooling process and getting ready to scale. Our team of experts, including the former head of manufacturing for Pebble, have been getting Olly ready for action since February 2017, We’ve also teamed up with the clever folk at Dragon Innovation, with several versions of Olly already completed. It’s the reason we’re super confident that the Olly you pre-order will be of the highest quality.</p>
<p>We are using Indiegogo as a way to validate our product. We want your help to scale the production process and get all units ready to ship. However, due to the complexity of Olly’s components being produced across the globe, there may be slight delays to the originally planned delivery times.</p>
<p>Also, being as smart as Olly doesn’t come cheap. We’re using the very best quality materials and technology, from the super-powerful CPU to the high-quality microphone arrays and gears ensuring superb sound quality and smooth movement. It means that Olly will be ready to impress right from day one. We know the pricing might reduce the number of backers who support us. But those who do will receive a truly state-of-the-art robot assistant (Olly told us to say that).</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">FAQ</h2>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>About Emotech</h3>
<p><strong>1. Who created it?</strong></p>
<p>We are a London-based start-up working on the innovative personal robot Olly, the first robot with personality. We have been selected as one of the Top 14 Start-up teams in Europe for Disrupt London by TechCrunch. BBC News and TechCrunch have reported that we have been named a CES 2017 Innovation Awards Honoree in four categories for our smart lifestyle assistant Olly Robot, a first for any startup product.</p>
<p>The inspiration for Olly came from the realisation that AI could be developed which would have a personality based on its users’ preferences and patterns, and that is where the name Emotech comes from, Emotion+Technology.</p>
<p><strong>2. What makes Olly different compared to other AI devices?</strong></p>
<p>Olly does what others don’t. Problems with current AI products are 1) Reactive rather than proactive. 2) Voice only, cannot detect its surroundings. 3. One-size-fits-all, i.e. lack of personalisation / customisation.</p>
<p>Olly is more than a robot. It is the first robot with personality. Day by day it gets to know your life patterns and begins to shape its personality to match yours. Olly is the only robot with a real learning system; its great uniqueness lies in its proactivity.  We have been preparing for manufacturing for a few months now, which means that we are confident the delivery will be of superb quality.</p>
<p><strong>3. Why do personality and emotions matter for robots?</strong></p>
<p>Emotion is the future of AI. Adding personalities and emotions isn’t just a fun experiment: it will help create virtual and physical robots that communicate more naturally. Emotions also aid in making computers smarter by offering motivational reminders and unconventional suggestions to encourage problem-solving.</p>
<p><strong>4. Why order now?</strong></p>
<p>By backing now you'll get to own one of the very first Ollies off the line plus exclusive access to prices only available during the Indiegogo campaign.</p>
<h3>About Usage</h3>
<p><strong>5. What if you wanted to change your morning routine (for example), can you </strong><strong>re-set</strong><strong>?</strong></p>
<p>Olly will do its best to use the whole available contextual information (the scope of which is fully controlled by the user) to quickly spot and adapt to changing user conditions. If some manual intervention is still necessary, Olly is always ready to listen to your feedback.</p>
<p><strong>6. Can Olly speak other languages?</strong></p>
<p>Olly speaks English for now in either a British or American accent and has a male or female voice. Our team is currently working on different languages, which will enter the testing phase by the end of this year.</p>
<p><strong>7. Will the voices be changed?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, Olly presently has two voices (male and female, British and American) and we will release more characteristic voices later.</p>
<p><strong>8. Will Olly become like a robot version of me?</strong></p>
<p>Olly won’t become like a robot version of you but it will continuously learn your preferences to proactively communicate with you and respond to your needs.</p>
<p><strong>9. Will Olly watch me sleep?</strong></p>
<p>Olly has two cameras, which means Olly can interact with you in both “awake” and “sleep” mode. For example, Olly knows when you come home and can talk to you proactively; Olly knows you are doing a push-up, and can cheer you on. But please don’t worry about your privacy as Olly doesn’t upload images or any raw data anywhere, and you can even turn off this proactivity feature of Olly if you prefer.</p>
<p><strong>10. How many people can use one Olly device?</strong></p>
<p>Olly feels best in home environments, and can recognise and offer a unique experience for each household member independently, up to 6 people.</p>
<p><strong>11. Can you link multiple Ollies together, so you have constant coverage around your home?</strong></p>
<p>Ollies on the same network (within the same environment) can exchange data.  </p>
<p><strong>12. How long does it take to set-up an Olly?</strong></p>
<p>Olly is very easy to set up. It comes together with a mobile app, through which you have to connect it to your wireless network. After that, you can log in with services such as, Gmail, Calendar, Music providers, etc., to increase the experience you will get out of Olly.</p>
<h3>About Data Security</h3>
<p><strong>13. Where does the data go?</strong></p>
<p>We are very aware of the importance of our users' privacy, and life at home is intimate and personal. We believe the best way to protect user’s data is by giving the users full control of their data and to follow all the official standards on data privacy in each and every country where the product is released. We don’t offer data to third parties, however, as everyone else, we would like to use some of the collected data to improve Olly and in doing so we will follow the golden standards behind data collection and storage, including transparency of what is used and how. Furthermore, we use data encryption and anonymisation to better protect Olly users.</p>
<h3>About Customer Service</h3>
<p><strong>14. Are there VAT charges involved?</strong></p>
<p>You will be responsible for the tax obligation in your respective jurisdiction. Duties and taxes differ wildly from country to country, state to state, province to province. Shipments will be made without any prepayment of duties, VAT, taxes, GST and/or HST. This means that there will be nothing additional to pay at the time you finalize your order; however, you will be responsible for taxes, duties and customs fees levied by the customs office in your country. This will likely mean your shipment will be held by customs until duties and taxes are paid.</p>
<p><strong>15. What is your refund policy?</strong></p>
<p>Refunds are processed on a case-by-case basis; at some point we will need to lock refunds in order to go into production &amp; shipment. We will not be able to refund orders once they've been shipped.</p>

</div></div>","WHY OLLY IS DIFFERENT Each Olly is unique because you are uniqueA ground-breaking AI engine allows each Olly to develop a unique personality, connecting with you on a highly personalised level.  Olly learns. You don't have to askProactivity* is one of Olly’s most unique features. Olly understands your patterns and schedules, processes the information based on context then acts on the information before you have to ask. Olly learns to be proactive in two ways: user defined and contextual awareness.*Don't worry, you have the full control. Olly will only be proactive under your permission.User DefinedOne way to teach Olly is to literally train Olly. For example, simply say ""Hey Olly, tell me the weather in the morning."" Olly will remember this and tell you the weather forecast automatically the next morning. You can train Olly to tell you the news, traffic, your calendar events etc.Contextual AwarenessOlly recognizes your routines and executes the most relevant and useful actions, such as play your favorite music and set the temperature to the right degree at the right time. To add to the experience, Olly draws connections to your calendar, email, TFL, news, BBC and so on. This gives Olly optimal information to better assist you.Like mentioned before, if this is not your thing, you have the full control. FEATURES (UPDATED 2.11.2017)A Perfect FitBased on your needs and personality, we do our best to match you with an Olly that will complement your lifestyle. No matter if you are an artist, a teacher, an engineer or an athlete there's an Olly for you. OLLY'S SCIENCE AND INNOVATION 
Emotional Character EngineOlly understands your facial expressions, vocal intonations, and verbal patterns. So whether you are happy or sad, Olly sees it and hears it.  This understanding allows Olly to move and talk to you in an unprecedented way.   
Vision-enhanced Natural Voice InteractionOlly interacts with people in a more natural way similar to how a person might. Olly does not only hear, but it can also see. Olly will proactively start a conversation rather than just reacting to a command. 
Multimodal User-recognitionOlly recognises people through visual and audio detection/by voice and by image. The two combined techniques work together to improve recognition rates. This is the foundation of Olly’s proactivity. Don't forget to bring your umbrella.
Action/activity Recognition & ForecastingOlly not only recognises what you’re doing, but can also learn the intention behind it. Subsequently, Olly is able to anticipate situations and offer helpful suggestions. 
Scene Understanding & Vision-augmented Beam-formingHearing you clearly across the room is important. Olly therefore uses vision to enhance its beamforming microphone array technology. Olly scans and analyses the surrounding environment to identify the room type and any potential obstacles between itself and you, so it can focus on you better. 
Expressive Visual Interaction SystemOlly communicates with you using a custom built circular LED display with a design language that is as visually unique as every Olly, yet understandable due to its shared core patterns.  INSIDE OLLY:CUTTING-EDGE INTERACTIVE TECHNOLOGY OLLY MAKES YOUR SMART HOME, SMARTEROlly is designed to seamlessly connect with your home’s most popular apps and smart devices and to listen to Internet radio.                                        PRE-ORDER NOW! PROJECT TIMELINE              WE ARE EMOTECHEmotech, the team behind Olly is made up of an incredibly talented and diverse group of individuals who all share a common goal: to create technology that’s more human －  technology that we can truly connect with, that understands us, and that ultimately improves our lives through innovative and more personal interactions.To bring Olly to life, we’ve assembled world-leading AI-scientists and researchers from the fields of machine learning, speech technology, and computer vision, as well as neuroscientists, psychologists, highly experienced software and hardware engineers, game designers, animation and sound artists and globally integrated marketing specialists. At Emotech, we come from over 20 countries and now work in London, Edinburgh, San Francisco, Armenia, Taipei, and Shenzhen.

As Featured In

 
 THE MAKING OF AND EARLY CONCEPTS Wake up, Olly!In September 2016, Olly stood up for the first time. Back then, it was merely a mechanical prototype that could not respond. Only 3 months later, Olly could hear and recognise our voice! Although acting a bit slow, Olly was able to rise and turn to find us! Earlier this year, Olly made another huge progress. From 8 meters away, it did not only wake up but also greeted us!

 
 LED IterationsOlly communicates through visual language, which is currently one of the most innovative technologies displayed by any robot on the market. Albeit not the only element, Olly’s LED are the key component of its interaction with the owner.  Our engineers, developers and designers cannot recount the many iterations and tweaks necessary to achieve the LED effects you see today. We've come such a long way! And we thoroughly enjoyed the process because we genuinely care about providing you with the possible user experience! OLLY IS READY TO MEET YOUBringing Olly to life has been a joint collaboration between AI researchers, human psychologists and neuroscientists. We’ve refined and perfected Olly across numerous prototypes to get to where we are today. Olly is now finally ready to go. We’re hugely excited to introduce Olly to the world and recruit the first owners to shape the personality of Olly, a robot that views the world more like a human than a machine. We commenced factory preparations in 2016, and are now waiting for the launch of our crowdfunding campaign to secure our manufacturing partner. With final testing and production scheduled for March 2018, pre-orders will be shipped in February to ensure you’re amongst one of the very first to experience Olly.  
WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET
Through crowdfunding we’re giving you the chance to be one of the world’s first owners of Olly. You’ll not only get to experience the first robot with a personality, with lifetime free Olly system upgrades, you’ll also be playing a part in shaping the future of Olly itself. More importantly, you will be involved in creating a new world of AI and encouraging our society to embrace this new technology.  
We’re looking for owners who’ll give us updates on their life with Olly, helping us to ensure every Olly is as uniquely brilliant as possible.
Olly can’t wait to meet you and empower your daily life.  
 
IMPACT
Emotech’s mission is to improve the relationship between humans and technology. Which is where you come in. We’re giving tech-lovers the technology to help make this happen. By becoming a proud owner of Olly, you can help us to create a better product and shape the future of Olly's development.
We want Olly to be an open platform. The more people who use Olly, the better Olly will become. We want our developers to have some fun with this project too, challenging them to create new software and hardware that pushes the existing boundaries of technology.To increase Olly’s skillset, we seek more talents from AI, design, voice and sound innovation and the medical field.
As a start-up, there’s a rebellious spirit that runs throughout Emotech. We’re looking for backers who share that spirit. Those who want to disrupt the ‘expected’ and help us create a more diverse AI world.
 
RISKS AND CHALLENGES
There are risks with production at every step of the way, but luckily for you, we've done all the hard work of getting a product through the tooling process and getting ready to scale. Our team of experts, including the former head of manufacturing for Pebble, have been getting Olly ready for action since February 2017, We’ve also teamed up with the clever folk at Dragon Innovation, with several versions of Olly already completed. It’s the reason we’re super confident that the Olly you pre-order will be of the highest quality.
We are using Indiegogo as a way to validate our product. We want your help to scale the production process and get all units ready to ship. However, due to the complexity of Olly’s components being produced across the globe, there may be slight delays to the originally planned delivery times.
Also, being as smart as Olly doesn’t come cheap. We’re using the very best quality materials and technology, from the super-powerful CPU to the high-quality microphone arrays and gears ensuring superb sound quality and smooth movement. It means that Olly will be ready to impress right from day one. We know the pricing might reduce the number of backers who support us. But those who do will receive a truly state-of-the-art robot assistant (Olly told us to say that).

FAQ
 
About Emotech
1. Who created it?
We are a London-based start-up working on the innovative personal robot Olly, the first robot with personality. We have been selected as one of the Top 14 Start-up teams in Europe for Disrupt London by TechCrunch. BBC News and TechCrunch have reported that we have been named a CES 2017 Innovation Awards Honoree in four categories for our smart lifestyle assistant Olly Robot, a first for any startup product.
The inspiration for Olly came from the realisation that AI could be developed which would have a personality based on its users’ preferences and patterns, and that is where the name Emotech comes from, Emotion+Technology.
2. What makes Olly different compared to other AI devices?
Olly does what others don’t. Problems with current AI products are 1) Reactive rather than proactive. 2) Voice only, cannot detect its surroundings. 3. One-size-fits-all, i.e. lack of personalisation / customisation.
Olly is more than a robot. It is the first robot with personality. Day by day it gets to know your life patterns and begins to shape its personality to match yours. Olly is the only robot with a real learning system; its great uniqueness lies in its proactivity.  We have been preparing for manufacturing for a few months now, which means that we are confident the delivery will be of superb quality.
3. Why do personality and emotions matter for robots?
Emotion is the future of AI. Adding personalities and emotions isn’t just a fun experiment: it will help create virtual and physical robots that communicate more naturally. Emotions also aid in making computers smarter by offering motivational reminders and unconventional suggestions to encourage problem-solving.
4. Why order now?
By backing now you'll get to own one of the very first Ollies off the line plus exclusive access to prices only available during the Indiegogo campaign.
About Usage
5. What if you wanted to change your morning routine (for example), can you re-set?
Olly will do its best to use the whole available contextual information (the scope of which is fully controlled by the user) to quickly spot and adapt to changing user conditions. If some manual intervention is still necessary, Olly is always ready to listen to your feedback.
6. Can Olly speak other languages?
Olly speaks English for now in either a British or American accent and has a male or female voice. Our team is currently working on different languages, which will enter the testing phase by the end of this year.
7. Will the voices be changed?
Yes, Olly presently has two voices (male and female, British and American) and we will release more characteristic voices later.
8. Will Olly become like a robot version of me?
Olly won’t become like a robot version of you but it will continuously learn your preferences to proactively communicate with you and respond to your needs.
9. Will Olly watch me sleep?
Olly has two cameras, which means Olly can interact with you in both “awake” and “sleep” mode. For example, Olly knows when you come home and can talk to you proactively; Olly knows you are doing a push-up, and can cheer you on. But please don’t worry about your privacy as Olly doesn’t upload images or any raw data anywhere, and you can even turn off this proactivity feature of Olly if you prefer.
10. How many people can use one Olly device?
Olly feels best in home environments, and can recognise and offer a unique experience for each household member independently, up to 6 people.
11. Can you link multiple Ollies together, so you have constant coverage around your home?
Ollies on the same network (within the same environment) can exchange data.  
12. How long does it take to set-up an Olly?
Olly is very easy to set up. It comes together with a mobile app, through which you have to connect it to your wireless network. After that, you can log in with services such as, Gmail, Calendar, Music providers, etc., to increase the experience you will get out of Olly.

<p>Simple things like how we use the toilet can have a big impact on our health and wellness. Many of us probably do not use the toilet as best as we should. We are simply unaware. That's why we invented TURBO, which makes using toilet the right way easy and seamless.</p>
<p>If we go back in time, people used to squat to release. Many in the East still do, and for good reasons. Western toilet was invented to provide convenience and comfort. But unfortunately sitting on the toilet creates a kink in the colon which makes it difficult to release, and makes us susceptible to a number of health issues like hemorrhoids, constipation, IBS, colon cancer, etc. With the western toilet we compromised wellness for comfort.</p>
<p>However, who wants to give up the comfort of western toilet? No one! And the good news is you do not have to, thanks to TURBO! TURBO is a toilet footstool for squatting and much more. You just sit on the toilet as you normally do, then place your feet on TURBO and lean forward a bit. This posture mimics squatting and brings the wellness back to the comfort of western toilet.</p>

Thus stimulating the appropriate pressure points of the feet can help with constipation and other colon issues. One can also enhance the health of different parts of the body by targeting the appropriate pressure points on the feet.</p>
<p>Our feet get beaten everyday from the time we wake up to the time we go to bed – so the massage can also be a very relaxing experience and improve blood circulation to get us through the day. We use the toilet everyday anyway, so why not make the best use of the toilet time!</p>

<div>
<p>TURBO is designed for easy and adjustable squatting, the lower toes area combined with the ramp design makes that possible. Raise your heels and then lift your legs few inches to load your feet easily (unlike a flat footstool where you will have to raise your feet all the way up). Moreover, squatting with raised heels is much more comfortable (try it!).

<p>One size fits many -- and this is one area where we have excelled compared to what is out there in the market.</p>
<p><b>TURBO</b> - Although you cannot adjust the height physically (it is intentional, to keep the design simple), the unique ramp design lets you position your feet forward or backward to adjust to a squat suitable to you.</p>
<p>Toilets come in different shapes and sizes, and people in a given household have different heights too. <b>A good <i>rule of thumb</i> is, if your feet rest on the floor comfortably when you sit on your toilet, you should be able to use TURBO's unique ramp design to get a good squat and adjust.</b> If your feet does not even touch the floor while sitting on your toilet, you can probably still use the TURBO to rest your feet on it and even get some squat (also don't forget that you can use the massage!).</p>
<p><b>FUSION</b> - This design is even more versatile. You can physically, but very easily, adjust the toe piece to a squat suitable to you. No need of adjusting the individual feet or any other complicated adjustments -- just sit on the toilet and move the toe piece to the right slots, no tools needed!</p>
<p><b>FLOAT</b> - The FLOATs are all interchangeable.</p>
<p><b>TOILET BASE</b> - Both TURBO and BLADE easily fit under a toilet with base diameter of <b>10"" or less</b>.</p>

<br/>We are just starting out and our margins are razor thin, if any, so unfortunately accepting returns will be cost prohibitive for us. Therefore we have made this very hard decision not to accept any returns (and our sincere apologies for that). Before making a pledge we encourage you to use some blocks in front of your toilet and try out if squatting helps you (and we are confident it will, as our body is designed like that). If it does, our products will make the squatting only easier and more relaxing.</div>

</div></div>","We use the toilet everyday anyway, so why not use it the correct way? The modern toilet sitting posture is known to be bad for health. Our product, TURBO, can help solve that issue.

 




Simple things like how we use the toilet can have a big impact on our health and wellness. Many of us probably do not use the toilet as best as we should. We are simply unaware. That's why we invented TURBO, which makes using toilet the right way easy and seamless.
If we go back in time, people used to squat to release. Many in the East still do, and for good reasons. Western toilet was invented to provide convenience and comfort. But unfortunately sitting on the toilet creates a kink in the colon which makes it difficult to release, and makes us susceptible to a number of health issues like hemorrhoids, constipation, IBS, colon cancer, etc. With the western toilet we compromised wellness for comfort.
However, who wants to give up the comfort of western toilet? No one! And the good news is you do not have to, thanks to TURBO! TURBO is a toilet footstool for squatting and much more. You just sit on the toilet as you normally do, then place your feet on TURBO and lean forward a bit. This posture mimics squatting and brings the wellness back to the comfort of western toilet.

Squatting is healthier. Our body is designed like that!
 

Squatting is healthy but uncomfortable. Sitting is comfortable but unhealthy. Turbo-squatting is just right!
TURBO has another key feature – feet massage. Feet has pressure points for different parts of the body, including the colon. Thus stimulating the appropriate pressure points of the feet can help with constipation and other colon issues. One can also enhance the health of different parts of the body by targeting the appropriate pressure points on the feet.
Our feet get beaten everyday from the time we wake up to the time we go to bed – so the massage can also be a very relaxing experience and improve blood circulation to get us through the day. We use the toilet everyday anyway, so why not make the best use of the toilet time!
 

Best use of the bathroom time – feels good and good for health!
Wellness is arguably the single most important thing for our well-being. But wellness is like a puzzle, there are several pieces to it. While we focus a lot on eating, sleeping, and exercising, we often neglect the pooping part which is just as crucial. Today many people who use the western toilet are simply unaware of this. With TURBO we want to bring the awareness and spread the wellness. 
 

Good to know: Just like eating, sleeping, and exercising, pooping is also a crucial piece of the wellness puzzle. Wellness will be always illusive without it!Health issues and soaring healthcare costs are among the #1 worries as we enter the 21st century. So it is becoming more important than ever to be in charge of our own health. Making simple lifestyle changes like this is the easiest way to stay healthy and live life to the fullest. 

 

We have some unique and patent pending designs for you! As you will see, we have excelled both in terms of form and functionality. We are bringing you a design that you will love to have in your bathroom and use it everyday.
Go ahead, show it off to your friends or when you have guests over in your house ... let them appreciate your healthy lifestyle and get inspired by you :)




TURBO is our flagship product. It will be plastic injection molded.
To use, sit on the toilet as you normally do. Take out the TURBO, place your feet on it and lean forward a bit. When not in use it stores nicely under the toilet bowel.
Placing our feet on TURBO elevates the knees above the hip, mimicking a squatting posture, which in turn aligns the colon for a clean and efficient release. Our body is designed like that :) 
Turbo-squat makes the 'job' easy!
With TURBO, we have excelled both in terms of form and functionality. Ordinarily, keeping a footstool by the toilet is not something one may feel proud of … that is all going to change with TURBO. While taking the functionality to the next level, we made NO compromise on aesthetics. TURBO has an elegant design and you will feel proud of having one in the bathroom, just as you would feel proud of having a 'yoga mat' in the living room – because both are symbol of healthy lifestyle!
Form and functionality!

TURBO is designed for easy and adjustable squatting, the lower toes area combined with the ramp design makes that possible. Raise your heels and then lift your legs few inches to load your feet easily (unlike a flat footstool where you will have to raise your feet all the way up). Moreover, squatting with raised heels is much more comfortable (try it!). You can also just move your toes forward/backward to adjust the squat very easily (effortlessly and without having to adjust the footstool physically).

Adjust to a squat comfortable to you, easily!
TURBO has integrated massage roller, called FLOAT (see the next section for more about FLOAT). Plus, it has storage for a spare FLOAT, so that you can get a different FLOAT experience with an easy swap – never get tired of the same massage!


 Easy swap a different massage!
 
 TURBO brings the wellness back at the comfort of the western toilet, with style!
 

FLOAT is the massage roller, and A/B are rollers with different surface features. Massage rollers are modular and interchangeable. FloatA has longitudinal ribs and FloatB has circumferential ribs.


Massage is a key highlight of TURBO, and it adds a whole new dimension to bathroom experience. Our feet get beaten up everyday from the time we wake up to the time we go to bed. So why not pamper our feet a little while attending the nature's call? It not only feels good, but also has health benefits. Among other benefits, massage can also be very relaxing and a great stress reliever.
A good feet massage first thing in the AM can help with blood circulation and provide a healthy foundation to get us through the day.

Massaging the feet stimulates the pressure points on the feetThe massage is not only a 'feel good' feature, it is also good for health. Massage the colon related pressure points on your feet to help with any constipation and improve colon health. Feet has other pressure points for different parts of the body that one can stimulate for enhancing the health.


Feet has pressure points for different parts of the body!
Life is getting busier day by day, and who has the time and money for a feet massage everyday? But now you can get a massage while sitting on the toilet and doing your business (takes no extra time), and for free! After all, we use the bathroom everyday anyway!
For many bathroom is no longer a place just to poop, it is also a temporary heaven (ask a mom!). So we integrated the massage to make your bathroom experience little more heavenly :)

Introducing Turbo FUSION, the hybrid of a TURBO and a BLADE (see our Kickstarter page for more info). It will be plastic injection molded with metal reinforcements.
We are introducing FUSION in the middle of the campaign based on our backers' requests. Thus there may be some more tweaks/changes to the final design. We will be doing testing before moving to production.
 
  
 
FUSION has four levels of height adjustment!
While TURBO works for most, FUSION gives that extra edge (in terms of elegance and functionality) for those who want it! FUSION has a toe piece that can be adjusted (easily and on the fly) to fit the need of different family members of different heights. No need of having different footstools for different-height family members, and no need to compromise on the squat.
Thus, FUSION offers the same functionality of BLADE, at a more affordable price.
 

TURBO dimensions are approximately 21.5” wide, 13” deep, and 3.5” high at the lower toes area and 8.25” high at the top of the hill ramp. The toes platform is at 10 degrees and the heel ramp is at 35 degrees. The arc is designed to fit a toilet base with diameter 10” or less. It will be plastic injection molded and weigh about 2.5 lb. 

TURBO Specs FUSION dimensions are approximately 21” wide, 14” deep, and 8” high. The toes platform is at 10 degrees and the heel ramp is at 35 degrees. The cutout is designed to easily fit a toilet base with diameter 10” or less. It will be made up of plastic with metal reinforcements. 

FUSION Specs The FLOATs are plastic injection molded and are about 4.5” long and 1” diameter. These will weigh less than 0.1 lb each.Note that these dimensions are only approximate and may change as we make some final tweaks to bring you the best product. If you have tight tolerance about the specs or need any other specific information, please do not hesitate to check with us.

One size fits many -- and this is one area where we have excelled compared to what is out there in the market.
TURBO - Although you cannot adjust the height physically (it is intentional, to keep the design simple), the unique ramp design lets you position your feet forward or backward to adjust to a squat suitable to you.
Toilets come in different shapes and sizes, and people in a given household have different heights too. A good rule of thumb is, if your feet rest on the floor comfortably when you sit on your toilet, you should be able to use TURBO's unique ramp design to get a good squat and adjust. If your feet does not even touch the floor while sitting on your toilet, you can probably still use the TURBO to rest your feet on it and even get some squat (also don't forget that you can use the massage!).
FUSION - This design is even more versatile. You can physically, but very easily, adjust the toe piece to a squat suitable to you. No need of adjusting the individual feet or any other complicated adjustments -- just sit on the toilet and move the toe piece to the right slots, no tools needed!
FLOAT - The FLOATs are all interchangeable.
TOILET BASE - Both TURBO and BLADE easily fit under a toilet with base diameter of 10"" or less.
 
 
Under normal use, both TURBO and BLADE are expected to last for years, if not a lifetime. It is a one time investment, amounts to only a few cents a day, that can have a lifetime of wellness benefits. You will also love to use it :) 

It costs very little for a lasting wellness!  





 
 

We are just starting out and our margins are razor thin, if any, so unfortunately accepting returns will be cost prohibitive for us. Therefore we have made this very hard decision not to accept any returns (and our sincere apologies for that). Before making a pledge we encourage you to use some blocks in front of your toilet and try out if squatting helps you (and we are confident it will, as our body is designed like that). If it does, our products will make the squatting only easier and more relaxing.

Phew … if you have read so far (and we hope you did because we spent months preparing for it :), now treat your eyes with some fun facts and cool graphics … enjoy!


As you can see, odds are not in our favor. Luckily it only takes a simple lifestyle change to greatly improve the odds. And the good news is TURBO makes that lifestyle change easy and seamless!

TURBO - best of both worlds!

TURBO combines the wisdom of East at the comfort of West!


 
Very first animation we had created to explain the concept.
Our very early sketches
A few of the several concepts we went through
Sourcing styrofoam from dumpster for mock ups and early proof-of-concept models. Then upgrading to wooden models.
Excited to get the prototypes!
Footage from the video making, hope you liked it …
We worked hard ... and we are finally here with TURBO and FUSION The ramp design has many advantages … one of those is that you can use it with your pant down but still on you :)

At NadiaLabs, our mission is to provide product and services that integrate seamlessly in our life and help with our wellbeing. We are a small but dedicated team of professionals with backgrounds in technology, design, and wellness. Tikka (Tikeswar Naik) is a co-founder and leads NadiaLabs. He is a huge fan of natural ways for wellness. He received his bachelor's from IIT Madras and PhD from University of Minnesota. He worked as a mechanical engineer and left his job in Jun 2012 to pursue his interests.  Risks and challenges
When I (tikka) decided to go ahead with this project, a colleague said 'tikka, this is your wheelhouse'. And I think I agree!
Anything worth pursuing has risks and challenges. However we have done everything we can to minimize those. For example our design team and manufacturing partners have over 20 years of experience. We have bootstrapped and invested our life savings to bring the project to a stage where it is now manufacturing ready. We have literally gone through several concepts, extensive model tests, prototypes, and we believe now we are ready.
However, we will listen to your, our backer's, feedback and make any tweaks or fine adjustments to bring you the best possible product. We will lock the design asap to avoid any delays.
Should any issue arise, I will work tirelessly for a resolution. We have a razor thin margin, but should any issue arise I promise I will choose order fulfillment over profit. By backing this project you trust us with your time and money, I will do anything and everything to preserve your trust on us.",53.0,1,"2 Campaigns

It’s like coffee magic. And you don't have to take their word for it, check out the word on the street... 

How Do We Do It?Conventional Cold Brew coffee takes 12-24 hours to brew but can take up to 72 hours. Who has time for that? We solved that problem with what we call ColdBoil™ technology. After 5 minutes with conventional Cold Brew methods, you'll have zero ounces of Cold Brew to drink. With the Dash Rapid Cold Brew System, you'll have plenty of Cold Brew to go around the meeting table. What do you mean ColdBoil™? This whole Cold Brew in 5 minutes seems pretty magical, huh. So how do we do it? Thanks to our proprietary patent-pending pump, we are able to create rapid circulation and create the same results you would get from the extraction of boiling without any added heat. The pump circulates water through the coffee matrix while the upper and lower filters in the coffee container keep the coffee grounds contained. This forces the water to permeate the structure of the grounds, thereby dissolving and extracting the flavorful coffee oils.   The carafe holds 50 oz. of water and after just 5 minutes, you have about 42 oz. of smooth, delicious cold brew coffee. It’s all about that yield baby. If you’re making ready-to-drink cold brew, you can make 42 fl oz (7 servings) of delicious sweet cold brew in as little as 5 minutes. For cold brew concentrate, you can max out at upwards of 16 servings.  *serving size is approximately 6 oz. Store your cold brew in the refrigerator and drink for up to 10 days.**Jim in our office has personally tested this and he’s still alive and running our logistics department. Averaging 1 cup per day of cold brew at Starbucks, you can spend upwards of $1600 in a year. And that’s just 1 cup a day - we all know about those 2 and 3 cup days. So in a 2 person household, you could be spending $3200 a year on your cold brew. Just think, you could be drinking that cold brew out of a coconut on the beach with all that money you save, smarty pants.  So, what is cold brew? You’ve probably seen an icy cup of cold brew advertised but we are here to give you the low-down. Simplified.  Traditionally, cold brew is coffee that has been steeped for a long period of time in cold water -- usually 12-24 hours. Because the coffee beans never come in contact with heat, the coffee oils don’t react with boiling water and don’t develop that acidic, bitter coffee tang. The result is a richer cup of joe with a smoother finish that’s easy on your digestive system. Brewing your coffee with cold water results in 65-70% less acid than hot drip coffee or espresso, per part. And if you’re looking for a buzz, cold brew also often has more caffeine than regular coffee. Thank you cold brew!And you can also reheat Cold Brew coffee and drink it hot. People with acid reflux who might not be able to drink regular coffee may find that hot cold brew is more tolerable to drink because of the lower pH.  So Cold Brew vs. Iced Coffee –what's the big deal? Iced Coffee is just coffee brewed hot and then cooled and poured over ice. Because brewing coffee hot can release bitter or acidic oils, Iced Coffee often has an undesirable flavor. Cold Brew is the better-looking, more talented cousin of Iced Coffee.   We designed the Dash Rapid Cold Brew System to be more compact and to fit easily on the countertop and in small spaces like apartments and dorms. We’ve been working on this for more than a year. From the initial idea, to the working engineering prototype, to the industrial design, to product testing and tooling.We’re busy working on the final execution of this revolutionary product and we need your help to get the first order.

We understand the unique challenges of home security hardware and are familiar with how to avoid and mitigate any issues that arise. Additionally, we have also established trusting relationships with our global logistics companies.But as per Belle, we may encounter these challenges 
It takes long to debug and optimize the stability of the overall AI software system. In this aspect, customer experience may be affected due to insufficient debugging time. 
The proper selection of speakers and microphones affects the accuracy of AI speech recognition, so there is a risk in the selection and debugging of these two devices. 
Complex assembly process of big button may cause the risk of delaying.
We are committed to delivering Belle on time with the high quality. Should there be any uncontrollable factor contributing to delays, we will keep you, our awesome backers, up to date, and you can also reach out to us anytime!",36.0,0,"1 Campaign

Even with soap and water, it is difficult to cleanse knives and flatware properly. These daily utensils can harbor harmful germs and bacteria. These microorganisms can remain on utensils and can contaminate your food and cause serious illness. Other sanitizing methods such as boiling or using antiseptic liquid are either too time-consuming or raise food safety issues.
 

  That’s why we invented Hookee Knife Guard to solve these problems. Hookee Knife Guard destroys bacteria using ultraviolet light to eliminate risks of infection common with raw and cooked foods. It also dries flatware with a built-in 158°F dryer to prevent mold and rust.
 
 

  Your food’s safety is the first priority. Hookee Knife Guard prevents the invisible threat of contamination to your flatware in two ways.
 

    Patented Jason HeaChips UV Lights 
Knife Guard uses patented UV LED lights to guarantee efficient, durable and eco-friendly decontamination. With 275nm wavelength, Knife Guard UV LED light eliminates bacteria by destroying the structure of DNA & RNA at the cellular level.
 

 
Compared to traditional mercury UV lamps, Hookee does not contain any toxic chemicals or release any fumes. It operates in a safe manner for you and the environment.
 

   158°F Dryer for Killing Germs 
 
In addition to UV treatment, Knife Guard applies a 158°F high-temperature drying process to utensils to prevent invisible kitchen threats. The 158°F temperature not only disinfects the knives and flatware but also dries them. It also maintains a sufficiently dry environment inside of the block that inhibits bacterial growth.
 

  Auto-sensing Mode for Convenient Use
​
Hookee's auto-sensing mode measures the humidity inside the block and turns on the auto cruise mode when necessary. Once the signal light is flashing, Hookee begins to protect the knives & flatware from moisture, mold, and rust. Just plug it in and go! Your knives & flatware dry automatically.
 

  
   Large Capacity 
Knife Guard holds most commonly used knives and accessories up to 8 inches deep such as chef knives, bread knives, cleavers, steak knives and even kitchen scissors. 

   Designed for Families 
3 different slots provide you with enough space for 12 knives along with 14 spoons, forks, and chopsticks. It can easily accommodate the utensil needs for a family of 6.
 

 
Smart Design
​
Elasticity double-layer parallel slots hold the knives perfectly in a safe upright position with blade separation, protecting their sensitive sharp edges.
 

  
   Compatible with All Utensil Materials 
Knife Guard is safe for all utensil materials including metal, ceramics, silicone and other food-grade plastics.
 

   Modular Design For Cleansing 
Detachable design for easy cleaning. Hookee’s top slots can be taken apart and cleaned with soap and water, keeping it safe and hygienic.",41.0,1,"1 Campaign

Why is it better?

The new beautifully integrated design is durable, portable, and compact. We've made it more affordable while maintaining the high quality product build. It's now even easier to maintain with less parts and automatic functionality, AND it's manufactured in the USA.

Our Story


Our names are Eric and Kevin. We're UC San Diego students and aquarium geeks who met in high school and share a passion for planted aquatic ecosystems. 


We started out working at various aquarium shops in San Francisco, including Aquatic Central and Aqua Forest Aquarium. We eventually started our own online aquarium store called Aqua Design Innovations while selling shrimp out of a garage.


As we got older, we started to become more aware of the harsher realities of our world, realizing that there are many people globally who face food and water shortages every day but that for most of us, such issues are so foreign.


We couldn't ignore the facts, so we decided to use our knowledge of aquariums to find a feasible solution.


We believe aquaponics is a clear solution to many of the food and water shortages humanity faces today. While this food production method was used thousands of years ago in early Aztec and Chinese civilizations, it has since fallen into disuse and become largely forgotten.
We hope to educate as many people as possible about the practical solution and beauty of aquaponics and to ultimately help initiate the process of bringing aquaponics to the forefront of today's agriculture. 
We were able to reach many with the first EcoQube, and now, we hope to reach even more with the EcoQube C! Please join our mission and share the EcoQube C with as many people you know!

How it All Started





In November 2013, we launched the first EcoQube on Kickstarter and raised over 200% our campaign goal, turning our idea into a reality.

Following a long and tedious manufacturing and production process, our first shipment of EcoQubes finally arrived in October 2014.



Check out the finished product below!

We shipped the EcoQubes out to all our backers and received an overwhelmingly positive response.

We couldn't have asked for a more amazing, supportive community of backers! Check out the forum they created showcasing their EcoQubes here! 
We wanted to make the EcoQube even more accessible and efficient, so we took all the feedback we got to further develop the product, which resulted in the EcoQube C!

<p>Rememory Packs are a tool that allows you to paint antique tiles any surface. Sturdy and endlessly reusable, they are as much a stunning visual statement as a call to action.</p>
<p>The stencils can be used on any surface, with spray or brush-on paint. They bend around curvy surfaces or flex to fit tight corners, the stencil pack has multiple designs to allow you to paint on geometric, flower patterns, wavy floor tile designs and more. With multiple designs to choose from in varying colors, they are versatile, fun and endlessly reusable. </p>
<p>We love antique tile patterns, we see them everywhere. </p>
<p><b>Inspired by the patterns in our city of Haifa's Wadi Salib Neighborhood, we made these stencils to serve as a beautiful mirror to echo memories of abandoned homes and their forgotten stories. </b></p>
<p>You can use the stencil pack on walls:</p>

Rememory Packs are a tool that allows you to paint antique tiles any surface. Sturdy and endlessly reusable, they are as much a stunning visual statement as a call to action.
The stencils can be used on any surface, with spray or brush-on paint. They bend around curvy surfaces or flex to fit tight corners, the stencil pack has multiple designs to allow you to paint on geometric, flower patterns, wavy floor tile designs and more. With multiple designs to choose from in varying colors, they are versatile, fun and endlessly reusable. 
We love antique tile patterns, we see them everywhere. 
Inspired by the patterns in our city of Haifa's Wadi Salib Neighborhood, we made these stencils to serve as a beautiful mirror to echo memories of abandoned homes and their forgotten stories. 
You can use the stencil pack on walls:

Rememory Stencils, indoor use

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Back in 2008 we set the concept for a new category of bed, being HiCan truly the world first smart bed ever conceived. We realized it´s become the most loved bed in the industry. </span></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">However the high price has made it accessible only to a few customers around the world. That is the real reason why we are here, because we really want to focus on consumer technology for everyone. Any meaningful innovation is going to be an every-person's technology.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">To do this we need the support of all who believe in our mission. We believe that crowd-funding is a powerful democratic tool capable of pushing forward innovation from the bottom, so the best way to promote our project aimed to change the furniture industry.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There are actually two things required in order for a new technology to be affordable to the mass market: first of all you must have economies of scale; secondly you have to iterate on the design, you must go through a few versions. Tesla business case is a clear evidence of this. When we created the first HiCan almost a decade ago our ambition was the same as it is today: to accelerate the advent of smart furniture for everyday living as soon as possible. When the Iphone arrived in 2007, it changed everything. Smartphones were revolutionary because of the ways they allowed hardware, software and services to work in unison. We envisioned at that time a future in which furniture could interact with users . However our first product was going to be expensive no matter how it looked like, so we decided to invest in design and make it the best we could, as we thought it had the best chance of being successful and finance the development of further products made gradually available for the mass market. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Electronics are now good and cheap, while software is more reliable and sophisticated. Their interplay is resulting in science-fiction-worthy ideas - we were promised long ago - becoming a reality. Keeping this in mind we have been working incredibly hard over a prototype for the past year to make a new HiCan that is much better in every way. The new HiCan has an improved design, uses innovative materials that guarantee a better engineering, allow for a greater flexibility in terms of hardware and deliver an even better experience. Still our main focus while approached the re-design of HiCan was having a tremendous focus on cost reduction, taking full advantage of technological advances. We were able to significantly reduce the cost compared to the first version, despite having greatly improved this version of the product. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">But we know we have a long road ahead of us to achieve our mission. For this reason t<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">he success of this campaign is essential and everyone's contribution who share the same vision is extremely important. </span></p>

<h2><b>Risks and challenges</b></h2>
<p><b>1. Manufacturing: </b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We have been working at this project for several months and already passed trough a few generations of prototypes. We believe the new HiCan is now ready for industrial production. We already have manufacturing in place, being almost entirely resolved the manufacturing and assembling of HiCan within our family owned woodworking industrial joinery facilities. Our design and technology partners are experienced professionals and we have been working with them for many years.</p>
<p><b>2. Testing &amp; Safety Approval: </b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">All our designs, materials, hardware and software products will undergo thorough testing and international regulatory safety standard approval before shipping.</p>
<p><b>3. Logistics: </b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">No risk here really. Since we’ve done this before. We have a proven track record of delivering the first HiCan in the following countries: Canada, Russia, Saudi Arabia, UK, USA and UAE. Our manufacturing is in Italy and we will be shipping our beds from there. We want the shipping process to be as seamless as possible for our backers. For this we are working with highly experienced international logistic partners to help us mitigate any issues that may arise with our fulfilment obligations.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">With all the above points in mind, we are mindful that unforeseen delays and challenges may arise, because we are doing something that has never been done before: a completely revolutionary walk-in smart device like nothing else in the market. While there may be manufacturing and production delays outside of our control, we promise timely and transparent communication throughout the process. If delays should occur, we will update you with our progress to finding a solution and keep any delays in dispatching orders to a minimum.</p>
<h2>
<br/><b>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</b>
</h2>
</div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><span>What are the shipping costs?</span></p>
<p>All shipping in Italy is free of charge. There is additional cost for international shipping. Shipment does not include extra fees from customs, or additional costs associated with your country. If it turns out that shipment to your country proves impossible, we will reimburse your order.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">What about sales tax / VAT and import duties?</p>
<p>You are responsible for paying any taxes and import duties, which apply in your country or state.Please enquire for a confirmed cost prior to ordering.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>How much will it retail for?</b></p>
<p>Our current recommended retail price is € 36,000, as it appears in the reward level information boxes, showing our Indiegogo supporters are definitely getting the best deal by supporting us!</p>
<p><strong>Am I going to receive an invoice for my HiCan reservation?</strong></p>
<p>Your HiCan reservation payment is refundable. An invoice will therefore not be available until the reservation is converted into a confirmed order. However, we will send you an official confirmation of your reservation payment by email.</p>
<p><strong>Can I cancel my HiCan reservation?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you can cancel at anytime by sending as a request by email at: info@hi-can.com. Refunds can take up to three weeks. The refund will be net of commissions paid to Indiegogo and to the payments system provider used by the platform (10%).</p>
<p><strong>Can I test “drive” HiCan?</strong></p>
<p>We are working to provide the opportunity to experience HiCan in several locations around the world once we begin production.</p>
<p><strong><span>When is the soonest I can get my HiCan?</span></strong></p>
<p>We have received an extraordinary number of reservations for the new HiCan. Production is scheduled to begin at the end of April 2017. At this time, the delivery estimate for new reservations is mid 2017 or later, depending on country of delivery. Our goal is to have the shipment out to you earlier but we have seen some of the challenges of others, and we want to make sure not to overpromise. In case we reach any of the stretch goals, the development of the additional features will probably delay the shipping to late 2017. This we promise: we are working around the clock to bring this to market. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><span>Can I choose what colour I want for my HiCan?</span></p>
<p>Yes, we are currently selling custom built versions of HiCan. Each bed is built to order. We have selected a number of finishes that enhance the iconic design of HiCan and make it easy to contextualize it in your interiors. As soon as we receive your pre-order we will send you the sample materials on the basis of your preferences in order to let you choose the ones that best interpret your personal taste. We can also reproduce any color of RAL (or NCS) Pallete for external finishes.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><span>Will HiCan work with Windows, Android and/or iOS? </span></p>
<p>We are designing HiCan so that it will work with any web-enabled device, with extra features to enhance the experience in our native app. Prior to launch; we are developing for iOS and Android. HiCan will also be accessible through a mobile-friendly and tablet-friendly web app, which can be accessed on any web-enabled device.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><span>Can I use multiple devices with my HiCan?</span></p>
<p>Yes. The app is free and a single HiCan can be connected to multiple devices (smartphones or tablets). For instance, if there are two people in the bed, they both can be primary users on their device(s).</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Will the bed sync with smart Internet of Things (IoT) devices?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The new version of HiCan is not based on traditional home or building automation components, but uses technology at the root of what is now called IoT. The controller’s logic is based on the very popular Raspberry Pi computer, enhanced with the professional Strato Pi board. HiCan will also be the first integrated bed platform based on open source software and applications. Leveraging the immense choices of sensors and devices that are already available or will be introduced in the future, HiCan becomes a fully customizable platform, with potential for further innovation that goes beyond the wildest imagination. We want the Indiegogo community to make suggestions as to how we integrate our bed with other 3rd party hardware such as: home thermostats, lights, curtains, door locks and home safety and security alarms.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><span>Can I become a distributor?</span></p>
<p>We are happy to discuss partnerships further after we complete our Indiegogo campaign and production begins. Hi-Interiors is considering offering exclusive distribution rights for specific countries and regions. These distributors will provide sales and servicing support to HiCan customers in their specific territory, as well as offer demonstration for prospective customers.  Exclusive distribution rights may be offered after the initial trial distribution period.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Can I make money with HiCan?</b></p>
<p>There are many ways in which you can potentially profit from owning a HiCan due to its unique nature and mass appeal. Like us, you can perform media demonstrations, attend shows and events, gain corporate sponsorship, and even lease your bed out for film and commercial work. We can help provide you with some of these opportunities. Soon, we expect to see HiCan Rental operations pop up throughout the world. This may provide a good source of revenue from owning one bed for commercial purposes.</p>
<p><strong>What more can you tell me about HiCan?</strong></p>
<p>It’s going to be awesome. We’ll continue to share more about the new HiCan with you over the coming months, as we get closer to production. Stay tuned!</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>I’m a journalist and have questions, who do I contact?</b></p>
<p>We’d love to help answer all of your questions. Please contact our press office at: info@agenziacopyright.it .</p>
</div></div>","HiCan is a contemporary and technological cocoon, a private sanctuary where you can enjoy a new concept of lifestyle and comfort. A perfect blend of design and technology to make life experience more authentic. 


 


Back in 2008 we set the concept for a new category of bed, being HiCan truly the world first smart bed ever conceived. We realized it´s become the most loved bed in the industry. 

However the high price has made it accessible only to a few customers around the world. That is the real reason why we are here, because we really want to focus on consumer technology for everyone. Any meaningful innovation is going to be an every-person's technology.
To do this we need the support of all who believe in our mission. We believe that crowd-funding is a powerful democratic tool capable of pushing forward innovation from the bottom, so the best way to promote our project aimed to change the furniture industry.
There are actually two things required in order for a new technology to be affordable to the mass market: first of all you must have economies of scale; secondly you have to iterate on the design, you must go through a few versions. Tesla business case is a clear evidence of this. When we created the first HiCan almost a decade ago our ambition was the same as it is today: to accelerate the advent of smart furniture for everyday living as soon as possible. When the Iphone arrived in 2007, it changed everything. Smartphones were revolutionary because of the ways they allowed hardware, software and services to work in unison. We envisioned at that time a future in which furniture could interact with users . However our first product was going to be expensive no matter how it looked like, so we decided to invest in design and make it the best we could, as we thought it had the best chance of being successful and finance the development of further products made gradually available for the mass market. 
Electronics are now good and cheap, while software is more reliable and sophisticated. Their interplay is resulting in science-fiction-worthy ideas - we were promised long ago - becoming a reality. Keeping this in mind we have been working incredibly hard over a prototype for the past year to make a new HiCan that is much better in every way. The new HiCan has an improved design, uses innovative materials that guarantee a better engineering, allow for a greater flexibility in terms of hardware and deliver an even better experience. Still our main focus while approached the re-design of HiCan was having a tremendous focus on cost reduction, taking full advantage of technological advances. We were able to significantly reduce the cost compared to the first version, despite having greatly improved this version of the product. 
But we know we have a long road ahead of us to achieve our mission. For this reason the success of this campaign is essential and everyone's contribution who share the same vision is extremely important.

We like to remember some of the quotes of the first passionate ones who contacted us showing curiosity and enthusiasm about this project, representing a great source of motivation to make it a reality.

The bed is packed with following features: 

The user interface will be a native iOS and Android app, currently under development, along with the multi-platform web application usable with any smartphone or tablet and already functioning. It will include controls for light, automation, and audio-video components. Apple Watch will also be supported. With the first HiCan we introduced a cultural revolution in the furniture industry, changing the relationship with technology in the interiors. 
However the automation system of the first version of HiCan was based on traditional home or building automation off-the-shelf discrete components, increasing the installation complexity and maintenance skill levels.

We believe in being an open and transparent company. We are happy to meet and speak to our backers about our shared passion for design and technology. We are based in Milan, so please feel free to drop us a message if you're around!

Hi-Interiors was founded as a spin-off start-up in 2008. We were young outsiders in the design scene, born in Calabria and grown as professionals within the furniture family business.

We decided to be game changers and start from a “blank sheet” in order to better exploit the HiCan revolution. Intuition was that this product could ride the long-term trend of convergence between design and technology, defining a new path for innovation in furniture sector. In 2009, the first HiCan was presented at Milan's Design Week.

The same year Intesa Sanpaolo has featured us in its first Start-up’s Arena among the 14 most innovative Italian start-ups. We are proud to be the very first to take full advantage of the latest technology to redefine human interaction with their interiors.

 

We currently have a working prototype

and we're now focused on:

Finalizing the engineering and industrial design of the final product ;
Developing the documentation (user manual, developer manual, etc.);
Designing packaging;
Developing and iterating on the user experience for the apps.

We will soon begin the process of:

Getting product certifications;
Developing health package (if stretch goal 1 is unlocked);
Developing voice control (if stretch goal 2 is unlocked).

Risks and challenges
1. Manufacturing: 
We have been working at this project for several months and already passed trough a few generations of prototypes. We believe the new HiCan is now ready for industrial production. We already have manufacturing in place, being almost entirely resolved the manufacturing and assembling of HiCan within our family owned woodworking industrial joinery facilities. Our design and technology partners are experienced professionals and we have been working with them for many years.
2. Testing & Safety Approval: 
All our designs, materials, hardware and software products will undergo thorough testing and international regulatory safety standard approval before shipping.
3. Logistics: 
No risk here really. Since we’ve done this before. We have a proven track record of delivering the first HiCan in the following countries: Canada, Russia, Saudi Arabia, UK, USA and UAE. Our manufacturing is in Italy and we will be shipping our beds from there. We want the shipping process to be as seamless as possible for our backers. For this we are working with highly experienced international logistic partners to help us mitigate any issues that may arise with our fulfilment obligations.
With all the above points in mind, we are mindful that unforeseen delays and challenges may arise, because we are doing something that has never been done before: a completely revolutionary walk-in smart device like nothing else in the market. While there may be manufacturing and production delays outside of our control, we promise timely and transparent communication throughout the process. If delays should occur, we will update you with our progress to finding a solution and keep any delays in dispatching orders to a minimum.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS


What are the shipping costs?
All shipping in Italy is free of charge. There is additional cost for international shipping. Shipment does not include extra fees from customs, or additional costs associated with your country. If it turns out that shipment to your country proves impossible, we will reimburse your order.
What about sales tax / VAT and import duties?
You are responsible for paying any taxes and import duties, which apply in your country or state.Please enquire for a confirmed cost prior to ordering.
How much will it retail for?
Our current recommended retail price is € 36,000, as it appears in the reward level information boxes, showing our Indiegogo supporters are definitely getting the best deal by supporting us!
Am I going to receive an invoice for my HiCan reservation?
Your HiCan reservation payment is refundable. An invoice will therefore not be available until the reservation is converted into a confirmed order. However, we will send you an official confirmation of your reservation payment by email.
Can I cancel my HiCan reservation?
Yes, you can cancel at anytime by sending as a request by email at: info@hi-can.com. Refunds can take up to three weeks. The refund will be net of commissions paid to Indiegogo and to the payments system provider used by the platform (10%).
Can I test “drive” HiCan?
We are working to provide the opportunity to experience HiCan in several locations around the world once we begin production.
When is the soonest I can get my HiCan?
We have received an extraordinary number of reservations for the new HiCan. Production is scheduled to begin at the end of April 2017. At this time, the delivery estimate for new reservations is mid 2017 or later, depending on country of delivery. Our goal is to have the shipment out to you earlier but we have seen some of the challenges of others, and we want to make sure not to overpromise. In case we reach any of the stretch goals, the development of the additional features will probably delay the shipping to late 2017. This we promise: we are working around the clock to bring this to market. 
Can I choose what colour I want for my HiCan?
Yes, we are currently selling custom built versions of HiCan. Each bed is built to order. We have selected a number of finishes that enhance the iconic design of HiCan and make it easy to contextualize it in your interiors. As soon as we receive your pre-order we will send you the sample materials on the basis of your preferences in order to let you choose the ones that best interpret your personal taste. We can also reproduce any color of RAL (or NCS) Pallete for external finishes.
Will HiCan work with Windows, Android and/or iOS? 
We are designing HiCan so that it will work with any web-enabled device, with extra features to enhance the experience in our native app. Prior to launch; we are developing for iOS and Android. HiCan will also be accessible through a mobile-friendly and tablet-friendly web app, which can be accessed on any web-enabled device.
Can I use multiple devices with my HiCan?
Yes. The app is free and a single HiCan can be connected to multiple devices (smartphones or tablets). For instance, if there are two people in the bed, they both can be primary users on their device(s).
Will the bed sync with smart Internet of Things (IoT) devices?
The new version of HiCan is not based on traditional home or building automation components, but uses technology at the root of what is now called IoT. The controller’s logic is based on the very popular Raspberry Pi computer, enhanced with the professional Strato Pi board. HiCan will also be the first integrated bed platform based on open source software and applications. Leveraging the immense choices of sensors and devices that are already available or will be introduced in the future, HiCan becomes a fully customizable platform, with potential for further innovation that goes beyond the wildest imagination. We want the Indiegogo community to make suggestions as to how we integrate our bed with other 3rd party hardware such as: home thermostats, lights, curtains, door locks and home safety and security alarms.
Can I become a distributor?
We are happy to discuss partnerships further after we complete our Indiegogo campaign and production begins. Hi-Interiors is considering offering exclusive distribution rights for specific countries and regions. These distributors will provide sales and servicing support to HiCan customers in their specific territory, as well as offer demonstration for prospective customers.  Exclusive distribution rights may be offered after the initial trial distribution period.
Can I make money with HiCan?
There are many ways in which you can potentially profit from owning a HiCan due to its unique nature and mass appeal. Like us, you can perform media demonstrations, attend shows and events, gain corporate sponsorship, and even lease your bed out for film and commercial work. We can help provide you with some of these opportunities. Soon, we expect to see HiCan Rental operations pop up throughout the world. This may provide a good source of revenue from owning one bed for commercial purposes.
What more can you tell me about HiCan?
It’s going to be awesome. We’ll continue to share more about the new HiCan with you over the coming months, as we get closer to production. Stay tuned!

We have tried several thickness of acrylic glass sheet on prototypes. Production started with a series of hand-drawn sketches. After the Ai drawing is done, it is loaded into a laser cutting machine and the part is cut from the acrylic glass sheet. The edges of the piece are then grinded and smoothed by hand. Afterwards, we brings the acrylic glass pieces back to our office and assembled by hand with care. We have spent 8 months to study the shape and form of each light bulb style, testing materials, developing 3D models, and sourcing the led base and laser cut workshops in local business. After tesing several laser cut workshops, we chose the ones with bigger machine and provision of acrylic glass sheet. Its long opening hours is very suitable for handling large production. For LED screw base, we selected Hong Kong based company, which has factory in Shenzhen. It has rich experience on led screw base production with CE safety certificate for worldwide export. We have tested their led parts and the light distribution was effective with no heat. We're happy to support and work closely with local business for sustainable production.  Dimensions   Light Bulb FeaturesWatts: 3W, equivalent to 25 Watt  Voltage: 110V or 220V, worldwide applicable  Life Hours: 15000 average hours  Base Type: Standard E27 Medium Screw BaseColor Temperature: 2700K warm white Energy efficient and light weight  Low heat Pendant Set FeaturesAluminium lamp socket in Black color, UL listed 2 meters round cord wire in Black colorCeiling rose OR Plug in Black color / Ceiling rose size height 25 mm x diameter 68 mm / Plug for your country usageAssembled and ready to be installed 110V to 220V, worldwide applicableweight approximately 0.2 kg Desk Lamp Set Featuresize: height 6.5cm x diameter 12cmAluminium lamp socket in Black color, UL listed  2 meters round cord wire in Black color  TOUCH on/off function attached with electrical plug Plug for your country usageAssembled and ready to be installed  110V to 220V, worldwide applicableweight approximately 0.25 kgRewards # A3 Poster For backers choosing our hkd70 pledge, you will be receiving one of the below cool design poster in A3 size. How the funds be used?  The funds will be used towards lamp production.

Please help us grow the LastSwab community and reduce plastic in our oceans. Click on a button below and spread some love for the planet. 
   
 
 
  
  
 
 
The tips of LastSwab also have the resilience to be cleaned thoroughly, enabling long-term use.     
LastSwab comes in several colors, so you can pick the one that fits you best. Standard LastSwab colors to the left and Make-up colors to the right:   The different colors make it easy for you to organize your swabs in your home so they don’t get mixed up!   
 
 
1.5 billion cotton swabs are produced every single day and the average American uses 415 cotton swabs every year. In the UK damage is evident: For every 100 feet of beach there are 9 cotton swabs.  Let's make single-use cotton swabs a thing of the past!   
 To create LastSwab, we tested dozens of prototypes – we wanted to get it just right. Both our two innovative designs feature a soft-feel tip. It is delicate enough to be suitable for sensitive body parts, and so precise that it’ll become a make-up essential.    
Paper, wood and hemp cotton swabs are bad too. The CO2 emissions from the production and transport of these single use cotton swabs can be avoided with LastSwab.The case for LastSwab is made of a corn based plastic, and the packaging it comes in is made of eco-friendly cardboard. The real game changer is that the swab is designed to last for thousands of uses – and we really hope the one you buy from us will be the LAST Swab.   LastSwab comes with a carry case so it's convenient to store and take with you on the go. 
We have been through hundreds of iterations in order to find the right feel and look for LastSwab - and we're pretty sure we’ve nailed it.  
The Swab is made up of a stiff, compact nylon core with soft tips on each end, and is both aesthetically pleasant and functional. 
 
  
 Change your habits for the good of the planet in a fuss-free way. Buy LastSwab once, cross cotton swabs off your shopping list forever, and do your bit for the environment. Easy.       
 We're a small team dedicated to creating sustainable alternatives to everyday products.

""These soft and beautiful mats allow women to experience the most natural parts of our lives with care, with privacy, with ease, and with dignity. ""

It also shouldn’t mean leaving your front door wide open. Would you share your bank passwords, your private mail or even your medical records with your neighbor, the postman or the government?
Right now, strangers are exploiting your political and religious beliefs, your desires, sympathies and convictions and even things about yourself that you aren’t yet aware of. Given enough data and time, your behavior might even be predicted.
Protecting your privacy is not about having something shady or nefarious to hide, it is simply about your private things not being anyone else’s business. We all need a place where we can go and be free of the judgmental eyes of other people.
Some imply that citizens and businesses who take measures to avoid tracking or surveillance are weird, guilty or paranoid. This logical fallacy impedes debate and implies that it is normal for government workers and corporation marketers to know everything about us, whether we like it or not. This line of thinking shows no regards for our individual freedom, national Constitutions and the UN's Human Rights Declaration, all cornerstones of free societies.
Did you know 700 million people across the world changed their on-line habits following the NSA revelations?
No one in their right minds would allow strangers to install cameras in their bedroom ; stop them from doing it in your computer.

<p>Ding was an idea that we had in the back of our minds for a long time – to design a doorbell that suited contemporary homes.</p>
<p>We were working as design consultants so rarely had time to develop our own concepts into something real. Until an opportunity came along that was perfect, the Design Council Spark!  </p>

</div></div>","Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Pinterest | YouTube | hello@dingproducts.com | Press KitWe’re making a simple, beautiful, smart doorbell that’s perfect for your modern home and makes your life easier.With our smart doorbell, whether you're out of earshot in the garden or busy at work, you’ll never miss a delivery again!   Our smart doorbell is made up of three parts, a subtle doorbell button that sits near your door, an elegant doorbell chime that sits in the home and a free app for your smartphone. When a visitor presses the button, the chime 'dings' in your home, but it also connects to the Ding app on your smartphone, allowing you to talk with the person at your front door from wherever you are in the world. At the moment there are either “dumb doorbells” that come with your house or are bought in a rush from a hardware store or “video doorbells” that are driven by technology, offering you more features than you could ever use.At Ding we want to give your doorbell some love and also think about what more it can do for you. We believe that you need a doorbell to be:

beautiful, because you’ve already spent a month picking out paint colours. 

simple, that doesn’t need a lengthy user manual to setup or use. 

smart, because the rest of your life is already on your phone.  
  We think that smart doorbells should look small, beautiful and contemporary to suit your modern home, so we made our Button and Chime as elegant as possible.    The Button is as small and simple with a choice of colours and it's slender enough to fit on your doorframe. The Chime is a fabric covered speaker with a choice of textiles, that can either sit on a shelf or be mounted on the wall.   We are making Ding in a CHARCOAL colour scheme which is subtle enough to suit most doors and interiors, as well as a BRASS DING *LIMITED EDITION*! Use the Ding app to receive calls straight from your front door, keep track of all your visitors and also silence the interior chime when you need some quiet time in your home. 
      Rather than trying to make it an all-in-one security cam, smart lock and motion sensor we want to provide simple, effective communication.The Button connects to the Chime using DECT, the same technology found in cordless telephones. This provides an HD audio connection from the outside of your house to the inside. It has a great range indoors of 40m and is excellent at getting through the walls of your home. The Chime talks to your home router using WiFi, the quickest and easiest way to connect your doorbell to the internet.The Button can be battery powered or hard wired to suit your home it has 3600 minutes of call time from one charge. This should last the average household 6 months with one caller each day from one charge. We recommend that you hardwire the button, but Ding will remind you when your Button needs charging if you choose battery power.  

Attach the Ding button to you door.

Place the chime anywhere inside your home.

Pair the chime to your WiFi...then you're ready to go!
 Smart on the inside. Ding is a two part system meaning that unlike other smart doorbells, if someone steals your button they won't have access to your network.It's good to talk. Ding gives you anonymity allowing you to choose how you answer the door, if you want to at all.Stay in control. Ding doesn't control the locks in your house, so there's no fear of opening up your home to strangers. John Nussey is a technologist, a proud early adopter of the Arduino prototyping platform and author of ‘Arduino For Dummies’.Avril O'Neil is a designer and has taught design at a variety of universities, including Goldsmiths and Central Saint Martins.We've been together for over 10 years working on many design and research projects, from prototyping secret products for entrepreneurs to building interactive installations for artists and museums.To turn our idea into a product we've grown the team bringing together talented designers, engineers, technologists, developers, marketers and business advisors.   
Ding was an idea that we had in the back of our minds for a long time – to design a doorbell that suited contemporary homes.
We were working as design consultants so rarely had time to develop our own concepts into something real. Until an opportunity came along that was perfect, the Design Council Spark!  

Over the following 4 months we set about defining exactly what Ding was and how we were going to make it. We went through dozens of prototypes to see what worked, found out what people liked and tested the user experience in the real world.

The Design Council saw promise in our idea, awarding us with funding and named us their most innovative product. We used this funding to further develop Ding with award winning product designers at Map Project Office.
With Map we focused on making Ding simple and beautiful, considering what would make a good button, where the chime would live in the home and how to make it suit modern homes. There were lots of prototypes!

We got married and fresh off our honeymoon we entered another accelerator called JLAB. This gave us the opportunity to work with leading UK retailer John Lewis. Here we've received amazing insight into the retail world and are still working with their buying team to launch Ding after Kickstarter.

To make sure we're getting it right we've been constantly getting feedback. Talking to early adopters at The Gadget Show Live, Kickstarter super backers at London Design Festival and meeting with interior design bloggers.

Did you know that there are over 500,000 street cats in New York City? These sweet kitties don't usually get the medical care they need when living on the street - Flatbush provides a safe, comforting environment for them to get treatment and recover, before being found a happy home, or being neutered and returned to where they were found.  You can learn more about Flatbush's mission in this short video: We wanted to help out this great organization, and we thought, why not make an adorable ""beanie baby"" style plush of Pocari Roo for you to take home? Inspired by the immense support of our previous fundraiser, all proceeds after costs (like making the plushies, shipping, etc) go to help Flatbush Cats with their important mission. About the CharityFlatbush Cats is a TNR-focused cat rescue organization focused on reducing and managing the outdoor cat population in Brooklyn - the rescue is run by a team of volunteers, who work tirelessly to help save the lives of as many kitties as they can. This includes cats that are sick or injured - Flatbush helps these kitties get well and find new homes.Flatbush has the following areas of focus for their outreach:
Cat rescue and medical care
Finding cats forever homes through adoption
Trap, neuter + return (TNR) assistance
Free or low cost cat spay/neuter for low income residents
TNR training and mentoring
Community food bank for colony caretakers who actively practice TNR
Rescue and fostering support
As a small, community-focused organization, your donation makes a huge difference. Food, medical care, milk, and other expenses add up quick, even for a small rescue. With your help, Flatbush can rescue more cats and help them get well. You can learn more about the charity by visiting their website: https://www.flatbushcats.org Find and follow them on social media too - they post so many pictures of cute kitties! Check them out on Instagram and Facebook.About Pocari RooPocari Roo is a YouTuber, fursuit maker, and artist from down under in Australia - and loves plushies! Pocari is passionate about cat rescue and suggested Flatbush as the charity to support - we thought, what better way to raise money for this good cause than a plush of Pocari Roo?(Why does he get to ride around in a Bugatti?!)We designed and created a beautiful, soft plush that is so cuddleable! Pocari tweaked the design until it was just right - and now it's available for you to get to support the charity.The RewardsPocari Roo and ArtworkTee created some awesome rewards for you to get - with your donation, you can get any (or all) of these cool items:Limited Edition Pocari Roo Plush ($30 plus shipping)Plush is made of minky and stuffed with soft polyester.

This enables them to buy food and supplies, medical care for sick kitties, and rescue even more cats. With this campaign, we are donating all profits to the charity, i.e. the amount raised minus the costs. These costs include things like card processing, fees which go to Indiegogo and Backerkit, and the costs to produce the rewards. We are keeping these costs as low as possible so that the maximum amount can be donated to Flatbush Cats.The estimates in our graph are based on a quantity sold of approximately 75 bundles (as that was the most popular item for preorders).  The exact percentage will depend on a number of factors, such as number of units sold, the amount of stretch goals reached, and which items are sold vs others.

<h1>How does it work?</h1>
<h4><b>Magnetic technology</b></h4>
<p>Each module is dodecahedron-shaped and has three magnetized sides that allow the connection between the modules and the passage of current from one to another. <b>Thanks to this innovative solution just one of the modules needs to be connected to the power grid</b>. The magnets' radial arrangement makes the modules snap-in rotatable so the light can be easily directed as one wishes. Indeed D-TWELVE is sized to perfectly fit in to one's hand and is completely safe to touch, due to the extra-low voltage current.</p>
<h4><b>High energy efficiency and durability</b></h4>
<p>With less than 5 watts per module D-TWELVE is a high energy efficient lamp and unlike many lamps on the market, <b>the LED can be easily replaced</b> just by opening the acrylic glass and unscrewing it (even if the estimated LED life is 50000 hours!). The light source used is a warm white (2700 k) high luminous flux LED Luxeon K, produced by Philips Lumiled. <b>This is one of the most advanced LED due to its high lumen density  and its low energy consumption</b> (345 lumen, less than 5 watts). When the lamp is turned on, the holes on the back ensure heat dissipation.</p>
<h1>How is it made?</h1>
<h4>
<b>Top quality materials</b> </h4>
<p>We meticulously check the quality of our supplies to offer a reliable and durable product. D-TWELVE is manufactured with top quality materials:</p>
<ul>
<li>the wood we use is European Beech wood. After CNC cutting, it is assembled by hand and polished with a natural benzene-free hardwax-oil;</li>
<li>the concrete cover is provided by a team of engineers experts on ultra-thin concrete furniture;</li>
<li>the screen-printed fabric is designed by a textile design firm with more than ten years experience in fashion accessories production;</li>
<li>all the metal components are powder-coated to ensure white finishing durability over time;</li>
<li>the textile cables are supplied by a company with over thirty years of experience.</li>
</ul>

""This lamp is unlike any you’ve seen before"" (BRIT+CO)
""Their lamp D-Twelve [...] explores the modularity, the versatility and the customizable design of lighting"" (FUBIZ)
""If you’re looking to light up your room with a beautiful LED lamp, the customizable D-TWELVE light may be just what you’re looking for "" (INHABITAT)
""This fully customisable modular lamp fits the user's unique style"" (DESIGN INDABA)
 What is D-TWELVE?  As design lovers we know how difficult is to personalize what designers have drawn for our home. Many times we face the difficulty of finding something unique and precious at the same time. D-TWELVE is an innovative LED lighting system created to suit your changing needs thanks to its magnetic connections. Reshape D-TWELVE every time you need it and change D-TWELVE appearance every time you want.
 
 

It's modular  

Choose the number of modules, from one to seven, and join them together in endless combinations. Direct the light where you want just rotating the modules with your hands. Shape D-TWELVE in unlimited forms, dimensions, orientations, materials and colours, according to your needs and taste: use a single or double lamp to brighten a table or build an amazing lighsculpture with seven modules!
 
  

It's versatile 
D-TWELVE is intended to be used in many ways: choose from the available add-ons and explore all the possible applications. Place D-TWELVE on the night table or fix it to the wall. Use more modules to brighten a room with a pendant lamp or create a chandelier for the living room.
 
  
It's customizable
To match your taste and your home style D-TWELVE is available in three different materials: beech wood, concrete and screen-printed fabric. Choose the one you like most or personalize your lamp mixing two or three materials together. Moreover you can choose from three textile cable colors: white, black and orange.
 
  
How does it work?
Magnetic technology
Each module is dodecahedron-shaped and has three magnetized sides that allow the connection between the modules and the passage of current from one to another. Thanks to this innovative solution just one of the modules needs to be connected to the power grid. The magnets' radial arrangement makes the modules snap-in rotatable so the light can be easily directed as one wishes. Indeed D-TWELVE is sized to perfectly fit in to one's hand and is completely safe to touch, due to the extra-low voltage current.
High energy efficiency and durability
With less than 5 watts per module D-TWELVE is a high energy efficient lamp and unlike many lamps on the market, the LED can be easily replaced just by opening the acrylic glass and unscrewing it (even if the estimated LED life is 50000 hours!). The light source used is a warm white (2700 k) high luminous flux LED Luxeon K, produced by Philips Lumiled. This is one of the most advanced LED due to its high lumen density  and its low energy consumption (345 lumen, less than 5 watts). When the lamp is turned on, the holes on the back ensure heat dissipation.
How is it made?

Top quality materials 
We meticulously check the quality of our supplies to offer a reliable and durable product. D-TWELVE is manufactured with top quality materials:

the wood we use is European Beech wood. After CNC cutting, it is assembled by hand and polished with a natural benzene-free hardwax-oil;
the concrete cover is provided by a team of engineers experts on ultra-thin concrete furniture;
the screen-printed fabric is designed by a textile design firm with more than ten years experience in fashion accessories production;
all the metal components are powder-coated to ensure white finishing durability over time;
the textile cables are supplied by a company with over thirty years of experience.

 
 Beechwood, concrete and screen-printed fabric cover 
Add-ons
Transforming D-TWELVE in a wall lamp, a table lamp or a ceiling lamp is quick and easy. Just attach one of the add-ons to the lamp:

WALL LAMP ADD-ON: a powder-coated steel plate;
TABLE LAMP ADD-ON: a beech wood handmade tripod;
CEILING LAMP ADD-ON: a self-balancing suspension system made of stainless steel wires and powder coated steel parts.

 
  
What Basic-TWELVE is?
Basic-TWELVE is a handmade concrete lamp shade we created for our (basic) supporters! It is designed for standard-sized E14 (SES) lamp holders and, thanks to three magnetized sides, it can be used alone or in multiple items combinations. Unlike D-TWELVE each Basic-TWELVE module has its own cable.

Renewable Energy Certificates (S-RECs).  SunPort is basically a smart outlet adapter that allows you to take advantage of these S-REC's in an effortless way.  Once you plug it in, the device measures the electricity you take from your wall outlet, and automatically upgrades it to solar power by matching it to new solar added to the power grid, tracked using 3rd party certified S-RECs.</span></p>

<p><strong>The Patented GlydeWrite Cleaning Shield</strong> is a new invention. It is a combination <em>ultra microfiber</em> screen cleaner and drawing shield. It allows you to draw on a tablet without experiencing ""Palm Rejection"". Each GlydeWrite comes with a <strong>High Quality </strong>fabric mesh Stylus<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Here's how it works:<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p>• Clean &amp; Polish your tablet screen</p>
<p>• Hook your Pinky in the loop</p>
<p>• Draw or Write without ""palm rejection""</p>
<p><strong>The GlydeWrite Cleaning Shield is an essential tool for creating art on an:</strong></p>
<p>• iPad • Kindle • Nexus 7 • Surface • Xoom • Nook • Acer</p>
<p>When it came to the picking the screen cleaner quality is the #1 issue. After doing some research I chose Pristine Screens, a company in Colorado. They manufacture <strong><em>Ultra Premium Microfiber Screen Cleaners</em></strong>. You can use it to polish, then nicely slide your Glydewrite across the tablet screen.</p>

<p> </p></div>","The Patented GlydeWrite Cleaning Shield is a new invention. It is a combination ultra microfiber screen cleaner and drawing shield. It allows you to draw on a tablet without experiencing ""Palm Rejection"". Each GlydeWrite comes with a High Quality fabric mesh Stylus.
Here's how it works:
• Clean & Polish your tablet screen
• Hook your Pinky in the loop
• Draw or Write without ""palm rejection""
The GlydeWrite Cleaning Shield is an essential tool for creating art on an:
• iPad • Kindle • Nexus 7 • Surface • Xoom • Nook • Acer
When it came to the picking the screen cleaner quality is the #1 issue. After doing some research I chose Pristine Screens, a company in Colorado. They manufacture Ultra Premium Microfiber Screen Cleaners. You can use it to polish, then nicely slide your Glydewrite across the tablet screen.

The unit has a distinctive look. The top is a light weight laminated shield attached to a fuzzy adjustable loop. The bottom is a bright red ultra microfiber cleaner. It feels good on your pinky and helps you draw some nice art.

</h3>
<div>
<p><span>Two architects from our team, Zsanett Benedek and Dániel Lakos were inspired by 3D modeling software using triangles (or faces) as their basic elements to create complex forms and surfaces. LOGIFACES started out as an idea to bring these complex geometries to a real, non-virtual space. They created the first version of the game from wood, but later started experimenting with concrete, and realised that the weight and touch of the material really capture the essence of the game. </span></p>

<p><span>Much like the ancient Chinese puzzle, Tangram, the geometry of the prisms originate from the simplest blocks and the goal is to use both the creative and logical sides of your brain.</span></p>
<p><span><br/></span></p>
<p><span><b>A blend of contemporary and ancient</b></span></p>
<p>When we created LOGIFACES, our inspiration came from the idea of blending 2D puzzles like Tangram with solutions used by contemporary graphics in 3D modeling software.</p>
<p>Computer graphics simulate complex surfaces, 3D forms and animations with the use of triangles. Even though computers have developed a bigger capacity that enable software to move beyond using triangles, this is a truly digital way of thinking that comes alive in the analogue world of LOGIFACES.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/962960/files/20141027092208-digitalia-magyarazas02.jpg?1414426928"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span>The original LOGIFACES set has several solutions to create an equilateral triangle. But there are many other possibilities to the game and we urge you to explore new forms beyond the basic triangle! Some of these forms were born at the first LOGIFACES meetup, where in anticipaton of our campaign, we met with interested LOGIFACERs to collect ideas and feedback about our prototypes.</span></p>

<p><b>An opportunity to develop yourself with your friends.</b></p>
<p>Playing LOGIFACES doesn't have to be a lone pastime, because thinking together with your friends is a whole new experience of the game.

</div></div>","Let go of the noise of everyday life at home or work, and unleash your imagination while training your mind with LOGIFACES!



LOGIFACES is a set of 16 prisms, each with different top angles, hand-poured from concrete. There is only one rule to the game: Create a form by placing the prisms next to each other to form a continuous surface.


From here on, LOGIFACES can be a game for many situations:

A meditative tool: Tune out the noisy din of everyday life - finding the right solution focuses your attention and calms your thoughts
A creativity booster: Think of new forms and try to assemble them with a continuous surface.
A challenge for your logical thinking skills: Find the place for each prism in the equilateral triangle or any other given form - a challenge for even the most experienced gamers.











Why are we on Indiegogo now?
During Autumn 2014, we've raised 185% of our $15,000 funding goal with LOGIFACES, and since then, we've been growing even further. After a year, we've decided that we liked what the Indiegogo platform had to offer, so we activated our InDemand campaign to continue reaching Indiegogo's community. 
We've also evolved our brand and product portfolio during 2015, and now we've become LOGIDEEZ, currently crowdfunding our second product, LOGIPLACES: Puzzle out your landscape!








""This sure as hell beats sudoku as a way to wake up your brain in the morning."" - Cool Material








   
A toy you'll be proud to exhibit.







The LOGIFACES origins: How did 3D modeling technology influence the world of analogue games?


Two architects from our team, Zsanett Benedek and Dániel Lakos were inspired by 3D modeling software using triangles (or faces) as their basic elements to create complex forms and surfaces. LOGIFACES started out as an idea to bring these complex geometries to a real, non-virtual space. They created the first version of the game from wood, but later started experimenting with concrete, and realised that the weight and touch of the material really capture the essence of the game. 

A beautiful toy you'll be proud to exhibit in your home or office.


The LOGIFACES experience comes in the form of 16 concrete prisms delivered in a one of a kind box. The concrete of the prisms is from a secret recipe used by our concrete manufactury, and one of its main specialties is that it comes in three beautiful colors.









Taking the puzzle experience to a new level.


Concrete takes the puzzle experience to a new level with its different touch and mass. We pour, grind and polish each piece, utilising our award-winning, many years of experience in the production of design objects.










Display it in your home or office when you’re not playing with it.

Our special packaging gives you the opportunity to display LOGIFACES when you’re not playing with it - it enriches your spaces by showing the essence of the design. When you’re playing with LOGIFACES, you don’t need to worry about packing up afterwards!













The challenge: Show your best at this blend of digital thinking and the ancient puzzle, Tangram.


There is only one rule to LOGIFACES: Create a form by placing the prisms next to each other to form a continuous surface.

The 25-piece set contains 11 different types of prisms, each of them identifiable by the height of their three vertices. These heights can be 1, 2 or 3 units.




Much like the ancient Chinese puzzle, Tangram, the geometry of the prisms originate from the simplest blocks and the goal is to use both the creative and logical sides of your brain.

A blend of contemporary and ancient
When we created LOGIFACES, our inspiration came from the idea of blending 2D puzzles like Tangram with solutions used by contemporary graphics in 3D modeling software.
Computer graphics simulate complex surfaces, 3D forms and animations with the use of triangles. Even though computers have developed a bigger capacity that enable software to move beyond using triangles, this is a truly digital way of thinking that comes alive in the analogue world of LOGIFACES.

The original LOGIFACES set has several solutions to create an equilateral triangle. But there are many other possibilities to the game and we urge you to explore new forms beyond the basic triangle! Some of these forms were born at the first LOGIFACES meetup, where in anticipaton of our campaign, we met with interested LOGIFACERs to collect ideas and feedback about our prototypes.







An opportunity to develop yourself with your friends.
Playing LOGIFACES doesn't have to be a lone pastime, because thinking together with your friends is a whole new experience of the game. Not only do you have to find the place for each prism, you have to take into account how the others have moved the elements. And of course, the best new forms are born when friends have fun together!









A toy for kids and adults of all ages
For kids who like a special logic challenge, LOGIFACES is a great way to fill their time and develop themselves. From what we've learnt through seeing them play, they are the best at creating new forms!








Beyond concrete: Experience the real prism challenge with LOGIFACES made of glass!
When we thought of the original, concrete prisms, we were quick to realize that a more luxurious glass version would look amazing. If you're one for modern glass sculptures, this one will even help you tune out and develop your creativity.








Choose the best set for you!




Are you thinking of surprising a loved one for Christmas who would go crazy over a set of LOGIFACES? Now is the time to choose the LOGIFACES that fits them best and order it before Christmas!

The wood-carving robots live in the valley

I’ve been working on making beautiful, tactile, custom wooden globes for two summers now.
I’m nearly there, but I have a problem.
I live in the mountains.
The wood-carving robots live in the valley, 2,000 feet down a twisting, mountain road.
As a part-time paramedic, I see the accidents that happen on that treacherous road on the worst days of winter.

With your help, I can create a wooden globe for my home, for yours and for many others’, a captivating reminder that this is where we live, this planet is our home.

Down to the fine grain

The wood-carving robot I need to create these globes – a ShopBot Desktop CNC router with essential accessories – will cost $15,000 Canadian, delivered to my door.
I can cover the first $10,000; I need your help with the remaining $5,000.

I can’t tell you how much I’m looking forward to packing up the first maps and globes and shipping them to you, wherever you are!

OK, doctor, tell me the worst

I’ve already eliminated some of the biggest risks in the making of these globes:

I’ve proved that I can get a beautiful finish in maple wood by carving maps of the local mountains;
I’ve fine-tuned the contrast between the oceans and the continents by carving North America and Antarctica as they would appear on a globe;
I’ve experimented with ways to carve both sides of each separate piece;
I’ve tried different ways to join fourteen pieces into a globe.

But there are challenges to come:

I need to finalize the methods for carving both sides of each piece and for joining fourteen pieces into a globe;
I need to pay particular attention to the alignment of the carving on the two sides of each piece and on adjacent pieces, so that the mountains line up seamlessly across the globe;
I need to prove the design of the simple wooden stand I’ll be supplying with each globe.

Remember, these globes don’t exist yet, because it’s hard to get enough time with the wood-carving robots down in the valley. That’s why I need your help. With a CNC router of my own, I’m confident I can make these globes a reality.

Who is this globe guy anyway?

Oops, sorry, in my enthusiasm to tell you about my globes, I left it a little late to introduce myself.
I'm Mark.
I'm a globetrotter who's been to all seven continents, and lived for a time on four of them, including Antarctica.
I'm a maker who can't stop creating: furniture, software, visualizations, books, maps and globes.
As a developer, I’ve conceived, implemented and released countless innovative software products, in fields as diverse as film editing and scientific simulation; so you know I’m a doer.
As a writer, I’ve completed four books, two of which have been published and went through many rounds of revision with myself, my agent and my editor; so you know I’m a finisher.
As a paramedic, I’ve attended to countless life-threatening injuries and illnesses, intervening decisively in the lives of others in their moments of crisis; so you know I’ll keep calm and do whatever needs to be done.

Let’s make the world out of wood

I really want these beautiful, tactile, custom wooden globes to exist. If you do too, there’s something you need to know.
This isn't a marketing campaign by an established company with dozens of employees and a mailing list of thousands. This is just me, Mark, with my one-person company, Kootenay Village Ventures Inc., trying to get this thing off the ground.
Which means that your contributions won't be going to pay off marketing consultants or video producers, they'll go straight into buying the carving machine I need to make my globes.
But it also means that the only way this is going to happen is if you help me get the word out.
Do you know someone who needs a globe in their life? (In my opinion, everyone needs a globe in their life.) Please point them to my website goodwoodglobes.com or this Indiegogo page igg.me/at/goodwoodglobes
If you’re on Instagram or Twitter, follow me @goodwoodglobes and re-tweet my campaign launch video. Use the buttons at the top to share this page on Facebook, Twitter or your own website.
In return for your early support, I’ve made the deepest discounts I can on the prices I’ll have to charge for my maps and globes in future. I’m also offering free shipping in the US and Canada, and 50% off shipping to the UK and the EU, even though it’ll cost me anywhere from $20 to ship a small world map within Canada to $300 to ship a 12"" globe to the UK.
Thank you so much for helping me make the world out of wood!

<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">OUR STORY</b><br/>
</h2><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">The
story of Biblezon is one of Faith, Hope, and Love of the catholic faith. I have
a solid history of faith which defines my decision to launch this product. I
believe deeply in the Catholic Church and Its mission. Like many other Catholics, my faith was not the center of my life.
I was busy with other earthly things and didn't care much about my catholic
faith. When I got married, I wanted a change for my family. Most especially I wanted to raise my kids catholic but how could I raise my kids catholic if I don`t know the faith?  It is then that I embarked on a faith journey. A faith journey that will help me discover a lot
of amazing things about my catholic faith. I have found great peace and joy by
practicing and living my faith and I believe every catholic can do the same,
which is why I invented the Biblezon tablet so that we can all stay focus on
our catholic faith and grow our relationship with God. It is the main reason
why we are here; to live the faith, know the faith and to be in communion with
God.</span><br/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">As a devout catholic, I spend most of my time
reading the bible, studying the catechism, going to mass frequently, meditating
on daily readings, knowing the saints, praying the rosary, reading many
catholic books and many other activities. I sometimes felt frustrated with the
many books and materials I have to carry about just to practice my faith. I
thought having a  place where I could put my faith life all in one position was
the solution. The idea of biblezon starting developing. I normally have different
apps on my phone that I use to practice my faith daily. One morning, I wanted
to read the daily meditations but found myself on Facebook and some other days I find myself either checking my email or doing something else. It was then
that the idea of biblezon was fully born. I need a separate space for GOD and I believe we all do. My favorite verse from the bible.</span><br/></p><p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><i>""Do not love the world or anything
in the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in them.
For everything in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and
the pride of life—comes not from the Father but from the world. The world and
its desires pass away, but whoever does the will of God lives forever""
 -John 2:15-16</i></b><br/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">I believe biblezon will create an environment
where Catholics can practice their faith free from distraction and from the

your catholic faith! Take your catholic faith with you everywhere with this
sleek holy tablet. Whether you want to read the bible, daily scriptures, pray
rosary, read your favorite catholic book or simply learn more about your
catholic faith, you want to have biblezon on your side.  Most of all,
you'll love the ability to learn, live and organize your catholic faith in
one place …….. Without any distraction. 


THE PURPOSE:The primary purpose of the
biblezon tablet is to create a pathway to holiness by providing a platform
where Catholics can learn, live & practice their faith daily.THE VISION:The main vision of the
company is to be the innovative leader in engaging Catholics to live and practice
their faith.
OUR STORY
The
story of Biblezon is one of Faith, Hope, and Love of the catholic faith. I have
a solid history of faith which defines my decision to launch this product. I
believe deeply in the Catholic Church and Its mission. Like many other Catholics, my faith was not the center of my life.
I was busy with other earthly things and didn't care much about my catholic
faith. When I got married, I wanted a change for my family. Most especially I wanted to raise my kids catholic but how could I raise my kids catholic if I don`t know the faith?  It is then that I embarked on a faith journey. A faith journey that will help me discover a lot
of amazing things about my catholic faith. I have found great peace and joy by
practicing and living my faith and I believe every catholic can do the same,
which is why I invented the Biblezon tablet so that we can all stay focus on
our catholic faith and grow our relationship with God. It is the main reason
why we are here; to live the faith, know the faith and to be in communion with
God.As a devout catholic, I spend most of my time
reading the bible, studying the catechism, going to mass frequently, meditating
on daily readings, knowing the saints, praying the rosary, reading many
catholic books and many other activities. I sometimes felt frustrated with the
many books and materials I have to carry about just to practice my faith. I
thought having a  place where I could put my faith life all in one position was
the solution. The idea of biblezon starting developing. I normally have different
apps on my phone that I use to practice my faith daily. One morning, I wanted
to read the daily meditations but found myself on Facebook and some other days I find myself either checking my email or doing something else. It was then
that the idea of biblezon was fully born. I need a separate space for GOD and I believe we all do. My favorite verse from the bible.""Do not love the world or anything
in the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in them.
For everything in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and
the pride of life—comes not from the Father but from the world. The world and
its desires pass away, but whoever does the will of God lives forever""
 -John 2:15-16I believe biblezon will create an environment
where Catholics can practice their faith free from distraction and from the
things of the world. I also believe that it is important to separate earthly
things from spiritual things thereby honoring God. He deserves it!

to raise money to complete manufacturing, customize the tablet to look catholic
and develop the various catholic applications.

<p>I believe that love is the way. I am no longer going to sit idly by and let all the negativity and hate run rampant in our world.

I am creating the 'Smart Love System', the same steps I followed to attract my soul mate, Sharon, into my life. Before Sharon came to me I always felt an emptiness in my heart even though I was in a long term marriage. I left that marriage and discovered these nine steps on my own.<br/></p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Luke Prince and I am a senior computer science major at Tennessee Technological University in Cookeville.<br/><br/>I go about grocery shopping in a section-organized manner. Using a 3""x5"" notepad, I subdivide a page into 4 sections and work my way through the list clockwise. In the upper right corner I shop for the fruits and veggies, then the meats in the bottom right, next the misc, and cold stuff last. My store's layout makes following this particular order most useful. On days that I have more shopping to do than usual, I will flip the page and start another subdivided list.<br/><br/>By taking my list and subdividing it into sections, I usually memorize a section's worth of items with only one glance at the list, and check them off after loading my cart. Another time saving piece comes in by having less distance to travel since I have trained myself to not leave a section until the sub-section of the list is finished.<br/><br/>My current findings in both the Android and iOS app markets seem to indicate that there is not an application that facilitates this kind of compartmentalized list making. I want to get the ball rolling! My goal is to implement a useful electronic version of my list method in Android with tablets as the initial build target (Ice Cream Sandwich), then handsets, and lastly build an iOS port if time and user interest are favorable.</p>
<h3>Free, Libre, Open Source Software</h3>
<div>To encourage participation in Android software development, I have made the decision to open source the MUGL project. Since I am new to Android programming, I hope to learn from people with more experience and an interest in the project that could help build it and contribute code enhancements, as well as comment on where I could do better.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><em>I plan on pairing MUGL soon with the AGPLv3 license, and would like to rely on donations for the application to support it, as I would rather focus on making a good product rather than filling it with advertisements.</em></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Interested? Visit the <a href=""https://github.com/jlprince21/MUGL"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MUGL GitHub page</a> to look into the code so far and let me know what you think. I am currently working on the most basic list portion of the application, and hope to have it be feature-complete before moving on to building sections and lists.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>To install the latest build of MUGL, visit the <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=us.textb.mugl&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsInVzLnRleHRiLm11Z2wiXQ.."" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Google Play page</a> for the project.</div>
<h3>Feature Goals</h3>
<div>For the ""complete"" release of the application, I have the following features in mind as my goals:</div>
<div><ol>
<li>Coupon token - a visual indicator you may place on items to remind you to use a coupon for the item. Handy for short timeframe coupons on items that you may only buy on occasion.</li>
<li>Starred items - place a star next to items that are more important than others.</li>
<li>List sorting - sort by status (checked/unchecked), sort alphabetically, sort by starred.</li>
<li>Item memorization - lists will store easily selectable, recently used items for making filling in a list quick with minimal typing required to expedite list building.</li>
<li>Section memorization - option to toggle section memorization for items, using most recent section as auto-placement criterion.</li>
<li>Arbitrary length lists - store practically a boundless number of items and lists within the app.</li>
<li>Offline list backup - locally stored, exportable XML for restoring lists to a device.</li>
</ol></div>
<div>In the future, enhancements may include:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Broad device support. iOS, tablets, smartphones, potential web app.</li>
<li>List sharing/online backup - email, text, or upload to Dropbox.</li>
<li>Graphical User Interface - improve layout and application design based on user feedback. More customizable skins.</li>
<li>Reminder notifications for specialized deadline lists (such as appointments, assignments, etc).</li>
<li>Specialty lists - support for niche list building/features based on customer feedback.</li>
</ol>
<div>As you can see, these features may be fairly involved, and I feel they will take quite some time for me to implement on my own, hence my F/LOSS approach for this first project.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>MUGL will help people save money to on their first trip to the grocery store. It will achieve this by helping them remember that pesky coupon they usually forget for chips, promote sticking with their list (avoiding impulse buys), and saving walking/browsing time by only shopping a section once. Even more time saving will come in on subsequent list making as MUGL saves previous items for future list construction.</p>
<p>For general list use, MUGL will in the future be limited only to your imagination... keep a list of movies you want to watch, birthdays, todos, or classroom assignments. Suggest a specialty list to me and with time permitting, I may be able to integrate it into the app in a future release!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The MUGL project's campaign will have its monies used in the following ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Android development reference books.</li>
<li>Snacks and caffeine. ;-)</li>
<li>Potential bounties for feature implementations.</li>
<li>Testing hardware purchase if project funding gains momentum.</li>
</ol>
<div>See ""Other Ways You Can Help"" section below for information on how you can contribute to the project.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In return, I am offering a gathering of interesting perks, mostly self-produced photography and humorous research papers.

</div></div>","My Story
Hello, my name is Luke Prince and I am a senior computer science major at Tennessee Technological University in Cookeville.I go about grocery shopping in a section-organized manner. Using a 3""x5"" notepad, I subdivide a page into 4 sections and work my way through the list clockwise. In the upper right corner I shop for the fruits and veggies, then the meats in the bottom right, next the misc, and cold stuff last. My store's layout makes following this particular order most useful. On days that I have more shopping to do than usual, I will flip the page and start another subdivided list.By taking my list and subdividing it into sections, I usually memorize a section's worth of items with only one glance at the list, and check them off after loading my cart. Another time saving piece comes in by having less distance to travel since I have trained myself to not leave a section until the sub-section of the list is finished.My current findings in both the Android and iOS app markets seem to indicate that there is not an application that facilitates this kind of compartmentalized list making. I want to get the ball rolling! My goal is to implement a useful electronic version of my list method in Android with tablets as the initial build target (Ice Cream Sandwich), then handsets, and lastly build an iOS port if time and user interest are favorable.
Free, Libre, Open Source Software
To encourage participation in Android software development, I have made the decision to open source the MUGL project. Since I am new to Android programming, I hope to learn from people with more experience and an interest in the project that could help build it and contribute code enhancements, as well as comment on where I could do better.
 
I plan on pairing MUGL soon with the AGPLv3 license, and would like to rely on donations for the application to support it, as I would rather focus on making a good product rather than filling it with advertisements.
 
Interested? Visit the MUGL GitHub page to look into the code so far and let me know what you think. I am currently working on the most basic list portion of the application, and hope to have it be feature-complete before moving on to building sections and lists.
 
To install the latest build of MUGL, visit the Google Play page for the project.
Feature Goals
For the ""complete"" release of the application, I have the following features in mind as my goals:

Coupon token - a visual indicator you may place on items to remind you to use a coupon for the item. Handy for short timeframe coupons on items that you may only buy on occasion.
Starred items - place a star next to items that are more important than others.
List sorting - sort by status (checked/unchecked), sort alphabetically, sort by starred.
Item memorization - lists will store easily selectable, recently used items for making filling in a list quick with minimal typing required to expedite list building.
Section memorization - option to toggle section memorization for items, using most recent section as auto-placement criterion.
Arbitrary length lists - store practically a boundless number of items and lists within the app.
Offline list backup - locally stored, exportable XML for restoring lists to a device.

In the future, enhancements may include:


Broad device support. iOS, tablets, smartphones, potential web app.
List sharing/online backup - email, text, or upload to Dropbox.
Graphical User Interface - improve layout and application design based on user feedback. More customizable skins.
Reminder notifications for specialized deadline lists (such as appointments, assignments, etc).
Specialty lists - support for niche list building/features based on customer feedback.

As you can see, these features may be fairly involved, and I feel they will take quite some time for me to implement on my own, hence my F/LOSS approach for this first project.



The Impact
MUGL will help people save money to on their first trip to the grocery store. It will achieve this by helping them remember that pesky coupon they usually forget for chips, promote sticking with their list (avoiding impulse buys), and saving walking/browsing time by only shopping a section once. Even more time saving will come in on subsequent list making as MUGL saves previous items for future list construction.
For general list use, MUGL will in the future be limited only to your imagination... keep a list of movies you want to watch, birthdays, todos, or classroom assignments. Suggest a specialty list to me and with time permitting, I may be able to integrate it into the app in a future release!


What I Need & What You Get
The MUGL project's campaign will have its monies used in the following ways:

Android development reference books.
Snacks and caffeine. ;-)
Potential bounties for feature implementations.
Testing hardware purchase if project funding gains momentum.

See ""Other Ways You Can Help"" section below for information on how you can contribute to the project.
 
In return, I am offering a gathering of interesting perks, mostly self-produced photography and humorous research papers. Each tier higher than the base tier of $1 donations will get each lower tier's perk as well. For example, if you donate enough to get Perk 3, then you also receive Perks 1 and 2 as well.
 
Note: All perks gifting a prerelease feature ""complete"" APK copy of MUGL can only be fulfilled upon completion of MUGL. All other perks will be fulfilled regardless of MUGL's completion. :-)
 
In the unfortunate event of the project not getting fully funded occurs, I will use whatever portion this campaign gathers to pay for Android development books. It would be a super stress-relief if the project started off near-black profit wise (with the exception of time spent developing), and would motivate me to continue to give it my all. This is going to be a multi-front learning experience and I will still be carrying through with the project regardless of how well funded it ends up being.

<p>Oomi Cam is the ultimate security accessory. It contains a siren, sound detection, and night vision, just to name a few of its features. It's also weatherized so that you can put it anywhere inside or outside your home.</p>

<p>Light affects the way we feel. Set Bulb to a forest green or songbird blue to change the atmosphere of a room. Wake up naturally with Bulb's gradual sunrise effect or relax after a long day with a warm sunset hue.</p>

<p>Plug is the easy way to turn an outlet into a smart outlet. Control a 
hard to reach lamp wirelessly or monitor the energy consumption of your appliances. Best of all, Plug has a USB port on the side to charge your devices without taking up an outlet.</p>
<br/>

<p>Oomi LED Strip is the ultimate aesthetics enhancer. Put them under your bed or behind a cabinet to illuminate a room. Set your lighting to a dim lust red, or a powerful midnight blue. Strip is 9 feet long and trimmable so that you make it shorter if you need.</p>
<br/>

<p>MultiSensor gives you more insight into what is going on inside of your home by detecting motion, temperature, light, UV rays, vibrations, and humidity. It can notify you if something suspicious happens or turn on your lights when you enter a room.</p>
<br/>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432543544/ou0pqb65dberzmvoooar.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Improve your security by knowing when doors and windows are opened or closed. Put it on cabinets containing valuable or dangerous items to keep them safe. Have your pantry lights set to come on as soon as you open the door.</p>
<br/>

<p>What if you could know about a flood before it was a problem? Now you can. Place Water Sensor under a leaky sink or in a flood-prone basement to get notified whenever water is around. You can also use Water Sensor to monitor the water level of a tank.</p>

<br/>
<p>Finally, you can have your Oomi home professionally monitored by a UL listed central monitoring station. This provides the same emergency response service offered by most home security companies, but with Oomi you don't have to make an appointment or have a stranger in your home to install.<br/>
And, in most cases, with 24/7 professional monitoring you can save money on your homeowner's insurance.  Even better? Right now you can get a $40 discount off the regular price.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Oomi Touch will make you never want to use a phone app to control anything in your home ever again. That being said, we don't expect you to carry it around with you. We've got a great app that allows you to monitor and control your home from anywhere in the world.</p>
<h3>Oomi is smart. Really smart.</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">With Oomi, you can design the intelligent home of your dreams.  But we offer you more than just the ability to create automated recipes based on “if this then that” logic. Oomi learns how you live. It learns what you do to keep your family safe and your home comfortable.  It learns how you like to relax, and how you like to have fun.  Then, it makes recommendations on what it can manage for you, so you can spend more time on the things that matter the most.</p>
<h3>Security is important. We've got you covered.</h3>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We want your home to be secure.  Sometimes the simplest solutions are the best. That's why we've created this magnetic lens cap cover for the camera, so you can be sure prying eyes are kept at bay.  We also use 128-bit encryption for every communication, both between devices inside your home and between your home and the cloud. These are just two of 7 unique security features we have built in to the Oomi system.  <a href=""http://oomihome.com/security"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""blank"">You can learn more here</a>.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Too many manufacturers like to hook you in to their products.  They build great systems, but later reveal that ONLY the products made or sold by them will work. Oomi is different.  We made our system incredibly easy to use through our innovations, but we also realize that there are many great products made by many great companies.  Our goal is to seek out some of these great technologies, and then make it as easy as possible to use these products with Oomi.</p>

<hr style=""font-weight: bold;height: 1px;width: 130px;margin-top:0px;""/>
<p>We are Fantem, the creators of Oomi. We believe that time at home is precious. It's when we get to pursue our passions, relax, and be with the ones we love. So we asked the question: how can we help everyone get more out of their time at home? Our answer: simplify aspects  of everyday life - like security, entertainment, and comfort - to allow you more time to focus on what matters most. We have created Oomi. With Oomi, we believe we can revolutionize the future of smart homes by removing the complexity and frustration associated with existing systems.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">FAQ</h2>
<hr style=""font-weight: bold;height: 1px;width: 130px;margin-top:0px;""/>
<div style=""text-align: left;"">
<br/>
<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;"">1. Creating My Oomi</h3>
<div><b>Tech scares me. Should I buy Oomi?</b></div>
<div>Yes! Oomi is incredibly simple and requires no technical knowledge.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Which accessories should I get?</b></div>
<div>It really depends on what you want out of your home. If you want to make your home more secure then Oomi MultiSensor would be the best option. If you want to monitor secure or dangerous areas of the home, then Oomi Door and Window Sensor is great. Oomi Bulb is ideal for those who want to change the ambiance of a room. Oomi Plug is fantastic for convenience as well as those interested in monitoring their energy consumption.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>How many accessories do I need?</b></div>
<div>The more accessories you have the more robust your system will be. There is also synergy when a home has multiple accessories. We find that 3+ accessories is the point at which you really start to enjoy the benefits of having a smarter home.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Can I add more accessories later?</b></div>
<div>Of course! To add new accessories to your Oomi system simply tap them with your Oomi Touch. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>How do I select my accessories?</b></div>
<div>A few weeks after the campaign finishes we will send out an email to everyone about selecting their accessories. We'll include a link where you can let us know which accessories you want to be included in your kit.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>How do I purchase additional accessories?</b></div>
<div>We'll be selling some additional accessories during the campaign through spontaneous flash sales at a discounted Indiegogo price. Additionally, we'll be introducing a few perks at the end for individual accessories.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>How will I know about flash sales?</b></div>
<div>If you've bought an Oomi pack then you'll be notified via email. You can also follow us on our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Oomi/857955797561983"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""blank"">Facebook</a> and <a href=""https://www.twitter.com/oomihome"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""blank"">Twitter</a> pages to make sure you stay in the loop.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>How much will more accessories cost?</b></div>
<div>We're offering all of our early backers the best price here on Indiegogo. After the campaign is over they will retail for $49.99 per accessory.</div>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><br/></b></div>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Can I get a second cube for my office?</b></div>
<div>You sure can! You can buy an Oomi system for anywhere you want to make smarter or more secure.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>I want to get get notified, how can I join?</b></div>
<div>Donating as little as a dollar will get you on the Indiegogo list for all future updates. We'll also make posts on our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Oomi/857955797561983"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a> and <a href=""https://www.twitter.com/oomihome"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Twitter</a> pages as well as to our email subscribers.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;"">2. Purchasing Questions</h3>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>How do I know my purchase went through?</b></div>
<div>You will receive a confirmation email within the first 24-36 hours after your purchase. Sometimes the orders take longer to process.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>I haven't gotten my confirmation email yet, should I be worried?</b></div>
<div>We're getting to everyone's emails as quickly as we can, but it could take as long as 48 hours to hear from us. If it's been longer than that then something might be wrong. Not to worry, just email us at contact@oomihome.com and we'll help get everything straightened out.
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>How do I select my accessories?</b></div>
<div>A few weeks after the campaign finishes we will send out an email to everyone about selecting their accessories. We'll include a link where you can let us know which accessories you want to be included in your kit.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>How do I select my Oomi Cube color?</b></div>
<div>It's the same process as the accessories. A few weeks after the campaign finishes we will send out an email to everyone about selecting their accessories. We'll include a link where you can let us know which accessories you want to be included in your kit.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Does shipping cost extra?</b></div>
<div>Shipping for the United States is free. International shipping is an extra $39 per kit. Other limited time perks have their shipping cost listed in the perk description.</div>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></div>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>How do I add international shipping to my purchase?</b></div>
<div>You can pay for shipping by purchasing the International Shipping Add-On perk. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>I forgot to add my international shipping cost... what should I do?</b></div>
<div>Oops! No worries, you can go ahead and pay the shipping cost now. Make sure you are logged in with the same Indiegogo account you used to purchase your Oomi. When the campaign ends we will make sure everything is as it should be. If you haven't added the shipping cost or if you paid too much by the end of the campaign we'll send you an email and get everything worked out.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>I ordered two perks, do I pay full price shipping for both of them?</b></div>
<div>Take $8 off for additional perks that ship together. If all your perks ship in October, pay full shipping for the first perk and take $8 off each additional perk. If you also have perks that ship in January (Oomi Cam, Oomi In-Wall Dimmer, and H2Oomi), again pay full shipping for the first perk and take $8 off each additional perk.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>I'm ordering a flash sale perk but already ordered a kit, do I need to add more shipping?</b></div>
<div>Take $8 off for additional perks that ship together. If all your perks ship in October, pay full shipping for the first perk and take $8 off each additional perk. If you also have perks that ship in January (Oomi Cam, Oomi In-Wall Dimmer, and H2Oomi), again pay full shipping for the first perk and take $8 off each additional perk.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>I overpaid shipping, what should I do?</b></div>
<div>Just hold tight, after the campaign is over we'll be emailing everyone who has overpaid.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Is there a monthly fee?</b></div>
<div>Nope. Once you buy Oomi you are good to go.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Do you have a warranty?</b></div>
<div>Yes, we have a 12 month warranty that covers any manufacturing defects. If you ever have a problem with any part of your Oomi system just contact us and we'll do our best to make it right.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Can I return my Oomi?</b></div>
<div>Unfortunately no, all of our sales here on Indiegogo are final. But, if you are having a problem or are unhappy with your Oomi you can always contact us and we will try to work something out.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>I want to become a distributor. Who should I contact?</b></div>
<div>Please reach out to our team at contact@oomihome.com.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>3. Privacy and Security</h3>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Can I turn off the camera?</b></div>
<div>Yes!</div>
<div>The camera has a notification light hardwired into its power supply. This means that whenever the camera is capturing video, the light will be on. Additionally, we have a physical power shut off toggle. When toggled off, the power connection to the camera is broken and there is no way to turn the camera back on without having physical access to your Cube. We also include a magnetic lens cap for your camera which snaps onto the font of Cube blocking the camera all together, so we've got you covered.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>What does Oomi think about Privacy?</b></div>
<div>We know that privacy must be taken incredibly seriously when it concerns your home. We will always be transparent about how your data is used to help you. Our policy is that your data belongs to you and should be used to make your life better.</div>
<div>If you have any concerns about your privacy please reach out to us and we will answer all of your questions as clearly as we can.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Does my data leave my home?</b></div>
<div>Oomi processes your data anonymously in the cloud. This allows you to control and monitor your home from anywhere in the world. It also allows your home to use our advanced intelligence algorithms to start automating your devices.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Do I need to have my data processed in the cloud?</b></div>
<div>No. We do everything to secure the privacy of your data. Still, we know that some people would prefer to avoid it all together. You are free to opt out of anonymous cloud processing at any time. Features that require cloud processing will no longer work. You may opt back in later if you choose.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Is my data secure?</b></div>
<div>To create a secure system we use 128-bit AES encryption for every communication, both the communications between devices inside of your home as well as those between your home and the cloud. We also have six additional unique security measures put in place to make sure that your system is safe. <a href=""http://oomihome.com/security"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">You can learn more here</a>.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>4. Technical Questions</h3>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Does Oomi support other smart home products?</b></div>
<div>Yes! There are some fantastic smart home products out there that you might already have. You will be able to integrate the most popular products into your Oomi system right from the start. We will continue to integrate others in the future as well.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Does Oomi support other Z-wave devices?</b></div>
<div>Yes. Oomi has the latest generation Z-wave chip in it and is compatible with all previous generations of Z-wave devices.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Will my devices be set to the right Z-Wave frequency?</b></div>
<div>Yes. We will ship the devices set to the appropriate frequency for your shipping address. If you want them set to a frequency other than the one for the area they're being shipped to, please contact us at contact@oomihome.com.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Will you have an Oomi phone app?</b></div>
<div>Yes. Oomi Touch is meant for inside your home. We're making iOS and Android apps so that you can monitor and control your home remotely.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>How much will the apps cost?</b></div>
<div>They are going to be free, of course.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>What happens if the internet goes out?</b></div>
<div>Don't worry, your house will still work. Some functionality does require access to the cloud and will be temporarily unavailable until your internet is back up. Most notably, the Oomi phone apps will not be able to control your home.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>What if the power goes out?</b></div>
<div>If your power goes out then your Oomi system will temporarily be down. As soon as you get power again everything will be back up and running. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>What is the range of Oomi Cube?</b></div>
<div>Outdoors Oomi has a range of 100 meters. Inside your home the range depends on what type of home you have. The accessories build a mesh network, which means that the more you have the better signal all of them will receive.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Do I need to recharge my accessories?</b></div>
<div>Most of our accessories draw power from whatever they're plugged into. The two exceptions are Oomi Streamer which comes with a power cable and Oomi MultiSensor which uses a preinstalled CR123A battery. MultiSensor will work for over 2 years before needing its battery replaced.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Why Z-wave and not ZigBee?</b></div>
<div>A lot of people are curious about this one. In a nutshell, Z-wave offered what we needed. ZigBee is a fragmented standard. Even if we had the latest ZigBee chip inside of Oomi there would be many ZigBee products that wouldn't connect. Most of the devices people want to connect to their Oomi systems use either Wi-Fi or Z-Wave. We want to spend our time making our system more robust and intuitive.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Will you be releasing an API?</b></div>
<div>Yes, and No. We get this question a lot.  We understand that there are many users out there, especially early fans of home automation where API was all but required to do the things they wanted to do.  But we believe this is also one of the things that has prevented mass adoption of smart home technology - the perception that you need to have a technical background, just to do cool things.  We have elected to go a different route with Oomi, and at this time we are focusing our efforts on creating the best user experience we can so that all can enjoy a great smart home experience. We also want to be able to provide the best customer support we can. In our opinion, to properly support an API community requires dedicated resources to support that effort, not just leave it up to some chat rooms or a corporate FAQ that gets updated once in never.  So no, we do not plan to release our API to individuals when we launch. For some of you, we realize that may mean that Oomi may not be the best choice at first.  That being said, an API is something we value and is currently available to select partners, and will be available to end consumers in the future when we are ready to be 100% behind it.</div>
<div><br/></div>
</div></div>","UPDATE: CES 2016
The past week members of our team have been attending the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show. There, Oomi received an Innovation Award in the smart home category! Innovation Awards are given to products that stand out in their design and engineering. We're excited that Oomi has been well received and can not wait to show off more of what it can do!



UPDATE: November 19, 2015
We know everyone is looking forward to receiving their Oomi.  We are working diligently to get everything finalized to get ready to ship to our backers, but we have some exciting news to share.  Starting today, you can get a sneak peak of Oomi at Target Open House in San Francisco.  
Starting tomorrow, we'll also be offering a great deal on a limited number of Oomi kits - don't miss your one last chance to get a great deal on Oomi before it's available at retail. Check back here often!!!

It is encased edge-to-edge in glass with a fully capacitive display and tactile buttons for quick control of your entertainment. You'll wonder how you ever lived without it.



Strikingly Functional
The responsive display of Oomi Touch is fully customizable so you can control what matters most to you.



Tactile Controls

Oomi has physical buttons to quickly pause your movie or skip to the next song on your playlist.



TV + Music + Ambiance
Oomi Touch is the only controller you need.  Goodbye remotes.





USEFUL OUT OF THE BOX



Oomi is Useful
Oomi Cube is the brain of your smart home. Most smart homes would call it their ""hub"". Hubs usually don't do much.  Oomi Cube is packed with 8 environment sensors, a night vision camera, and a bit more. Having sensors inside of Cube allows it to know more about your home. When your Oomi Cube knows more it can do more for you. For example, because Oomi Cube already has a light sensor in it, your home can brighten your lighting when a room gets darker automatically.


Oomi helps manage your home






YOUR PERFECT HOME

You are unique. Your home should be too. We made some incredible accessories so you can create a home that does exactly what you need.





Oomi Cam is the ultimate security accessory. It contains a siren, sound detection, and night vision, just to name a few of its features. It's also weatherized so that you can put it anywhere inside or outside your home.


Light affects the way we feel. Set Bulb to a forest green or songbird blue to change the atmosphere of a room. Wake up naturally with Bulb's gradual sunrise effect or relax after a long day with a warm sunset hue.


Plug is the easy way to turn an outlet into a smart outlet. Control a 
hard to reach lamp wirelessly or monitor the energy consumption of your appliances. Best of all, Plug has a USB port on the side to charge your devices without taking up an outlet.


Oomi LED Strip is the ultimate aesthetics enhancer. Put them under your bed or behind a cabinet to illuminate a room. Set your lighting to a dim lust red, or a powerful midnight blue. Strip is 9 feet long and trimmable so that you make it shorter if you need.


MultiSensor gives you more insight into what is going on inside of your home by detecting motion, temperature, light, UV rays, vibrations, and humidity. It can notify you if something suspicious happens or turn on your lights when you enter a room.


Improve your security by knowing when doors and windows are opened or closed. Put it on cabinets containing valuable or dangerous items to keep them safe. Have your pantry lights set to come on as soon as you open the door.


What if you could know about a flood before it was a problem? Now you can. Place Water Sensor under a leaky sink or in a flood-prone basement to get notified whenever water is around. You can also use Water Sensor to monitor the water level of a tank.




We have two special accessories



Streamer is the ultimate television companion. It streams HD media directly from the internet to your television. Quickly catch up on your shows on Netflix or HBO GO.

Oomi air monitors air contaminants to make sure your air is healthy. It senses PM2.5, which are EPA monitored particles that are one fortieth the width of a human hair.

Connecting accessories
With Oomi, adding accessories to your home is as simple as you would expect.


The Ultimate Controller




SMARTHOME DOES NOT MEAN IOT


It might seem like a no-brainer that your smart home should work even when your internet is down. Oddly enough, that hasn't been the case. With Oomi, it finally is.




IMPROVE YOUR HOME SECURITY


With Oomi your home is not only smarter, it is more secure.  But we recognize that everyone's security needs are different, so we have created three perfect options so you can create the perfect system for you and your family.  Out of the box, Oomi offers a numbers of security enhancing features at no additional cost:




Deter
Robbers target empty homes. Have your home mimic your lighting patters while you're away so it appears occupied.



Detect
With 8 different sensors including glass break and motion detection, you will know when something is wrong.




Notify

Oomi will notify you if anything seems out of place in your home while you're away.

If you want even more security, you can add Personal Home Monitoring Plus (PHM).


Finally, you can have your Oomi home professionally monitored by a UL listed central monitoring station. This provides the same emergency response service offered by most home security companies, but with Oomi you don't have to make an appointment or have a stranger in your home to install.
And, in most cases, with 24/7 professional monitoring you can save money on your homeowner's insurance.  Even better? Right now you can get a $40 discount off the regular price.

Oomi Touch will make you never want to use a phone app to control anything in your home ever again. That being said, we don't expect you to carry it around with you. We've got a great app that allows you to monitor and control your home from anywhere in the world.
Oomi is smart. Really smart.

Security is important. We've got you covered.

We want your home to be secure.  Sometimes the simplest solutions are the best. That's why we've created this magnetic lens cap cover for the camera, so you can be sure prying eyes are kept at bay.  We also use 128-bit encryption for every communication, both between devices inside your home and between your home and the cloud. These are just two of 7 unique security features we have built in to the Oomi system.  You can learn more here.




COMOOMITY

Too many manufacturers like to hook you in to their products.  They build great systems, but later reveal that ONLY the products made or sold by them will work. Oomi is different.  We made our system incredibly easy to use through our innovations, but we also realize that there are many great products made by many great companies.  Our goal is to seek out some of these great technologies, and then make it as easy as possible to use these products with Oomi.

Integrate other products into your Oomi System

No one wants to be locked into a closed ecosystem. That's why we're integrating  Oomi with some exceptional technologies. We've built Oomi with the next generation of Z-Wave, the most widely used wireless home automation technology.
You can connect all sorts of things to your Oomi home, from door locks that secure automatically when you go out, to air conditioners that cool your home when you're coming back.

Yes! Oomi is incredibly simple and requires no technical knowledge.

Which accessories should I get?
It really depends on what you want out of your home. If you want to make your home more secure then Oomi MultiSensor would be the best option.

Oomi Plug is fantastic for convenience as well as those interested in monitoring their energy consumption.

How many accessories do I need?
The more accessories you have the more robust your system will be. There is also synergy when a home has multiple accessories. We find that 3+ accessories is the point at which you really start to enjoy the benefits of having a smarter home.

Can I add more accessories later?
Of course! To add new accessories to your Oomi system simply tap them with your Oomi Touch. 

How do I select my accessories?
A few weeks after the campaign finishes we will send out an email to everyone about selecting their accessories. We'll include a link where you can let us know which accessories you want to be included in your kit.

How do I purchase additional accessories?
We'll be selling some additional accessories during the campaign through spontaneous flash sales at a discounted Indiegogo price. Additionally, we'll be introducing a few perks at the end for individual accessories.

How will I know about flash sales?
If you've bought an Oomi pack then you'll be notified via email. You can also follow us on our Facebook and Twitter pages to make sure you stay in the loop.

How much will more accessories cost?
We're offering all of our early backers the best price here on Indiegogo. After the campaign is over they will retail for $49.99 per accessory.

You sure can! You can buy an Oomi system for anywhere you want to make smarter or more secure.

I want to get get notified, how can I join?
Donating as little as a dollar will get you on the Indiegogo list for all future updates. We'll also make posts on our Facebook and Twitter pages as well as to our email subscribers.

2. Purchasing Questions
How do I know my purchase went through?
You will receive a confirmation email within the first 24-36 hours after your purchase. Sometimes the orders take longer to process.

I haven't gotten my confirmation email yet, should I be worried?
We're getting to everyone's emails as quickly as we can, but it could take as long as 48 hours to hear from us. If it's been longer than that then something might be wrong. Not to worry, just email us at contact@oomihome.com and we'll help get everything straightened out.

Does shipping cost extra?
Shipping for the United States is free. International shipping is an extra $39 per kit. Other limited time perks have their shipping cost listed in the perk description.

How do I add international shipping to my purchase?
You can pay for shipping by purchasing the International Shipping Add-On perk. 

I forgot to add my international shipping cost... what should I do?
Oops! No worries, you can go ahead and pay the shipping cost now. Make sure you are logged in with the same Indiegogo account you used to purchase your Oomi. When the campaign ends we will make sure everything is as it should be. If you haven't added the shipping cost or if you paid too much by the end of the campaign we'll send you an email and get everything worked out.

I ordered two perks, do I pay full price shipping for both of them?
Take $8 off for additional perks that ship together. If all your perks ship in October, pay full shipping for the first perk and take $8 off each additional perk. If you also have perks that ship in January (Oomi Cam, Oomi In-Wall Dimmer, and H2Oomi), again pay full shipping for the first perk and take $8 off each additional perk.

I'm ordering a flash sale perk but already ordered a kit, do I need to add more shipping?

If you also have perks that ship in January (Oomi Cam, Oomi In-Wall Dimmer, and H2Oomi), again pay full shipping for the first perk and take $8 off each additional perk.

I overpaid shipping, what should I do?
Just hold tight, after the campaign is over we'll be emailing everyone who has overpaid.

Is there a monthly fee?
Nope. Once you buy Oomi you are good to go.

Do you have a warranty?
Yes, we have a 12 month warranty that covers any manufacturing defects. If you ever have a problem with any part of your Oomi system just contact us and we'll do our best to make it right.

Can I return my Oomi?
Unfortunately no, all of our sales here on Indiegogo are final. But, if you are having a problem or are unhappy with your Oomi you can always contact us and we will try to work something out.

I want to become a distributor. Who should I contact?
Please reach out to our team at contact@oomihome.com.

3. Privacy and Security
Can I turn off the camera?
Yes!
The camera has a notification light hardwired into its power supply. This means that whenever the camera is capturing video, the light will be on. Additionally, we have a physical power shut off toggle. When toggled off, the power connection to the camera is broken and there is no way to turn the camera back on without having physical access to your Cube. We also include a magnetic lens cap for your camera which snaps onto the font of Cube blocking the camera all together, so we've got you covered.

What does Oomi think about Privacy?
We know that privacy must be taken incredibly seriously when it concerns your home. We will always be transparent about how your data is used to help you. Our policy is that your data belongs to you and should be used to make your life better.
If you have any concerns about your privacy please reach out to us and we will answer all of your questions as clearly as we can.

Does my data leave my home?
Oomi processes your data anonymously in the cloud. This allows you to control and monitor your home from anywhere in the world. It also allows your home to use our advanced intelligence algorithms to start automating your devices.

Do I need to have my data processed in the cloud?
No. We do everything to secure the privacy of your data. Still, we know that some people would prefer to avoid it all together. You are free to opt out of anonymous cloud processing at any time. Features that require cloud processing will no longer work. You may opt back in later if you choose.

Is my data secure?
To create a secure system we use 128-bit AES encryption for every communication, both the communications between devices inside of your home as well as those between your home and the cloud. We also have six additional unique security measures put in place to make sure that your system is safe. You can learn more here.

4. Technical Questions
Does Oomi support other smart home products?
Yes! There are some fantastic smart home products out there that you might already have. You will be able to integrate the most popular products into your Oomi system right from the start. We will continue to integrate others in the future as well.

Does Oomi support other Z-wave devices?
Yes. Oomi has the latest generation Z-wave chip in it and is compatible with all previous generations of Z-wave devices.

Will my devices be set to the right Z-Wave frequency?
Yes. We will ship the devices set to the appropriate frequency for your shipping address. If you want them set to a frequency other than the one for the area they're being shipped to, please contact us at contact@oomihome.com.

Will you have an Oomi phone app?
Yes. Oomi Touch is meant for inside your home. We're making iOS and Android apps so that you can monitor and control your home remotely.

How much will the apps cost?
They are going to be free, of course.

What happens if the internet goes out?
Don't worry, your house will still work. Some functionality does require access to the cloud and will be temporarily unavailable until your internet is back up. Most notably, the Oomi phone apps will not be able to control your home.

What if the power goes out?
If your power goes out then your Oomi system will temporarily be down. As soon as you get power again everything will be back up and running. 

What is the range of Oomi Cube?
Outdoors Oomi has a range of 100 meters. Inside your home the range depends on what type of home you have. The accessories build a mesh network, which means that the more you have the better signal all of them will receive.

Do I need to recharge my accessories?
Most of our accessories draw power from whatever they're plugged into. The two exceptions are Oomi Streamer which comes with a power cable and Oomi MultiSensor which uses a preinstalled CR123A battery. MultiSensor will work for over 2 years before needing its battery replaced.

Why Z-wave and not ZigBee?
A lot of people are curious about this one. In a nutshell, Z-wave offered what we needed. ZigBee is a fragmented standard. Even if we had the latest ZigBee chip inside of Oomi there would be many ZigBee products that wouldn't connect. Most of the devices people want to connect to their Oomi systems use either Wi-Fi or Z-Wave. We want to spend our time making our system more robust and intuitive.

Will you be releasing an API?
Yes, and No. We get this question a lot.  We understand that there are many users out there, especially early fans of home automation where API was all but required to do the things they wanted to do.  But we believe this is also one of the things that has prevented mass adoption of smart home technology - the perception that you need to have a technical background, just to do cool things.  We have elected to go a different route with Oomi, and at this time we are focusing our efforts on creating the best user experience we can so that all can enjoy a great smart home experience. We also want to be able to provide the best customer support we can. In our opinion, to properly support an API community requires dedicated resources to support that effort, not just leave it up to some chat rooms or a corporate FAQ that gets updated once in never.  So no, we do not plan to release our API to individuals when we launch. For some of you, we realize that may mean that Oomi may not be the best choice at first.  That being said, an API is something we value and is currently available to select partners, and will be available to end consumers in the future when we are ready to be 100% behind it.",66.0,5,"1 Campaign

</div><p><b>Fed
up with figuring out the complicated VPN settings? </b></p><div>
</div><p>It all started when I was working
in China, I found a large number of websites blocked by the Great Firewall that
were essential for me to access, such as my financial institutions in the US, as
well as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, just to name a few. I had used numerous
VPN services and it was frustrating to deal with software installation and
updating the server lists again and again. I had also tried different free or
paid proxy services and found most of them with similar problems. </p><div>
</div><p>
</p><p><span> 

</span></p><p>There came the original PlutoBoXX
in September 2013, it is designed to solve the software installation and
updating servers problems, but the setup procedure was a bit clunky, and the
built in power supply was not necessary. The original PlutoBoXX only supports
our VPN infrastructure (<a href=""http://www.plutovpn.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>www.PlutoVPN.com</u></a>),
so there is a limited choice on servers.<span> 
PlutoBoXX is based on open architecture, using Open DD-WRT as a base; we
added our own intelligent routing algorithm, and our own user interface. A
patent has been filed for this concept, and we are the first of its kind on the
market. </span></p>

<p>I have used the original PlutoBoXX in China with great success! It is not a 100% smooth when watching a long streaming video, but most of the time it is stable. It can be slow at times depending on the type of Internet connectivity you use. Through analyzing and listening to our customers’ feedback, we set to kick off the second generation — PlutoBoXX II –it’s even more compact and easier to use. PlutoBoXX II has had major improvements over its first generation. Now, it is truly a<b> Plug and Play</b> device with no setting configuration from users. The device will automatically detect your connection method (via another router, or direct connection to Cable or DSL modem), and connect to the available VPN servers, or TOR bridges, without any user interaction. Advance users can still go to our website: <u><a href=""http://www.PlutoBoXX.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.PlutoBoXX.com</a></u> and click “Go To My PlutoBoXX” to make changes.

<p><strong>A</strong>.
Yes, no user input, just simply Plug and Play - there is no set-up required.

available VPN server is automatically selected. </p>
<p><b>Q.</b>
<b>Do I need to pay subscription fees? </b></p>
<p><b>A.</b>
No subscription fees are required.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong>
<b>What is Tor?</b></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> The Tor project is a
non-profit organization that conducts research and development into online
privacy and anonymity. The Onion Router is an Internet networking protocol and
make it difficult, if not impossible, for any snoops to track your browsing
habits or your location. </p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong>
<b>Who owns Tor?</b></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong>
Tor is a free application and Tor protocol is open source, meaning anyone can
view the code and incorporate it into their own software.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong>
<b>What is the difference between Tor and
proxy servers?</b></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong>
When you use a proxy, you leave a trail of log files around the internet.With Tor, it routes through
several hops to obscure the IP address. Here’s the explanation: While using Tor,
you connect from your router to an onion router, to another onion router, etc,etc.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong>
<b>What is the difference between Tor and
VPN?</b></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong>The
Tor servers route through different servers that making you untraceable online.
For VPN, it routes through the servers
and assigns a new IP address for all applications/data on your computer in
order to access the information - one of the most significant benefits
associated is its security, every bit of the data transmitted through the
network is secured via 128bit encryption, that ensures users an anonymous and
secure internet surfing and bypass geo-restriction and access any content you
desire. </p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong>
<b>Does Tor slow down the internet
connection speed? </b></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong>
Since it jumps through sophisticated path of nodes in a random pattern,<span>  depends
on the distance / bandwidth between nodes, the transmission might be slower.</span></p>
<p><strong>Q. Does Tor work in China?</strong></p>
<p><em><em><strong>A.</strong></em></em> The answer is NO, TOR is fully
blocked in China, but we have another way to get around it. If in China, VPN
might be the way to go if TOR is blocked. If in other countries, TOR might be
the choice. User can always go to our website : <a href=""http://www.plutoboxx.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>www.PlutoBoXX.com</u></a> , click “Go To My PlutoBoXX”

updating the server lists again and again. I had also tried different free or
paid proxy services and found most of them with similar problems. 

 

There came the original PlutoBoXX
in September 2013, it is designed to solve the software installation and
updating servers problems, but the setup procedure was a bit clunky, and the
built in power supply was not necessary. The original PlutoBoXX only supports
our VPN infrastructure (www.PlutoVPN.com),
so there is a limited choice on servers. 
PlutoBoXX is based on open architecture, using Open DD-WRT as a base; we
added our own intelligent routing algorithm, and our own user interface. A
patent has been filed for this concept, and we are the first of its kind on the
market. 

PlutoBoXX 
I have used the original PlutoBoXX in China with great success! It is not a 100% smooth when watching a long streaming video, but most of the time it is stable. It can be slow at times depending on the type of Internet connectivity you use. Through analyzing and listening to our customers’ feedback, we set to kick off the second generation — PlutoBoXX II –it’s even more compact and easier to use. PlutoBoXX II has had major improvements over its first generation. Now, it is truly a Plug and Play device with no setting configuration from users. The device will automatically detect your connection method (via another router, or direct connection to Cable or DSL modem), and connect to the available VPN servers, or TOR bridges, without any user interaction. Advance users can still go to our website: www.PlutoBoXX.com and click “Go To My PlutoBoXX” to make changes. It is still based on Open DD-WRT software, and used OpenVPN protocol.

PlutoBoXX II supports TOR
project, as well as our own VPN infrastructure. TOR is an open network that
allows user to surf anonymously and securely. If you want to learn more about
TOR, please visit: 
""http://www.torproject.org"" www.torproject.org.   
If you’re seeking anonymity,
PlutoBoXX is the way to go. PlutoBoXX II works by routing your internet traffic
through Tor’s network of randomly selected relays that are scattered around the
world or through our own VPN infrastructure (depending on where you are). 
PlutoBoXX II is the ultimate
Internet security solution that secures your web surfing and maintains your
anonymity and privacy with maximum protection. 
We are looking to raise $7,500
for continued production of PlutoBoXX II. We need your support to bring
internet freedom back in your control.

Q.
Do I need to pay subscription fees? 
A.
No subscription fees are required.
Q.
What is Tor?
A. The Tor project is a
non-profit organization that conducts research and development into online
privacy and anonymity. The Onion Router is an Internet networking protocol and
make it difficult, if not impossible, for any snoops to track your browsing
habits or your location. 
Q.
Who owns Tor?
A.
Tor is a free application and Tor protocol is open source, meaning anyone can
view the code and incorporate it into their own software.
Q.
What is the difference between Tor and
proxy servers?
A.
When you use a proxy, you leave a trail of log files around the internet.With Tor, it routes through
several hops to obscure the IP address. Here’s the explanation: While using Tor,
you connect from your router to an onion router, to another onion router, etc,etc.
Q.
What is the difference between Tor and
VPN?
A.The
Tor servers route through different servers that making you untraceable online.
For VPN, it routes through the servers
and assigns a new IP address for all applications/data on your computer in
order to access the information - one of the most significant benefits
associated is its security, every bit of the data transmitted through the
network is secured via 128bit encryption, that ensures users an anonymous and
secure internet surfing and bypass geo-restriction and access any content you
desire. 
Q.
Does Tor slow down the internet
connection speed? 
A.
Since it jumps through sophisticated path of nodes in a random pattern,  depends
on the distance / bandwidth between nodes, the transmission might be slower.
Q. Does Tor work in China?
A. The answer is NO, TOR is fully
blocked in China, but we have another way to get around it. If in China, VPN
might be the way to go if TOR is blocked. If in other countries, TOR might be
the choice. User can always go to our website : www.PlutoBoXX.com , click “Go To My PlutoBoXX”

We will apply the number of votes to each team and send out a final email within the week letting everyone know the top 10 teams that we will be targeting for NCAA licensing.Q: How do I install a DoorFoto?A: This is one of the greatest things about our product....IT IS SIMPLE TO INSTALL. Our DoorFotos are more like a fitted bed sheet. They are made out of a special blend of fabric and simply wrap around the face of the door. No tools, no cutting, no adhesive tape etc, etc, etc. The only thing you might need is a little step stool (depending on how tall you are) to reach the top of the door.Q: How does the DoorFoto accommodate for the door hinges and door handle or door knob?A: With our fabric DoorFotos you simply stretch the material over the door handle or door knob for a clean professional finished look. Because of the athletic, stretchable fabrics that we use it is easy to still access your door knob or door handle simply by moving aside the fabric to get access. When you don't need to get access to the door handle, knob or keyhole, simply cover it up with the fabric.Q: What does the back of my door look like with a DoorFoto on it?A: DoorFotos are made with stretchable fabric, elastic banding at the top and bottom, and corners sewn.  The amount of area the DoorFoto takes up on the BACK of your door is very minimal, with a small triangular area wrapped around the back corner of the door, so as to keep the DoorFoto in position and with the right amount of tension. Q: Can I re-use and wash my DoorFoto?A: DoorFotos are made from athletic fabric...the same kind of fabric that you might be wearing right now from Nike or Under Armour. Because of this reason it is easily machine washable and can be put in a dryer without any worries about the color fading or shrinking. Yes, not only can you wash our DoorFotos, but you can use them over and over and over again. It is really that simple. And when you are not using your DoorFoto you simply fold it up like any other piece of clothing and store it away. This is what makes this product so great....the ease of use, durability and brilliant colors that won't fade in the washing machine.Q: Where are DoorFotos made?A: All of our fabric DoorFotos are made right here in the United States. To be more specific...in beautiful Tampa, Florida. We custom-fabricate every DoorFoto per order using the highest quality equipment and materials.Q: What if I don't see the size that I need?A: For manufacturing reasons, we are focused on the (4) most common sizes of 36x80, 36x96, 32x80 and 30x80 for exterior and interior doors. Because the DoorFotos are made out of a polyester/spandex blend they do have a little stretch so don't worry if your door is not exactly 36x80, 36x96, 32x80 or 30x80 as there is about 1"" leeway in each direction. So if your door measures 35x79 or 33x80 then the DoorFoto will fit just fine. If you are unsure, email us.Q: How Do You Make a DoorFoto?A: We use a printing process called dye-sublimation to create our DoorFotos. Although there are other printing methodologies that we could use, we found that through extensive testing dye-sublimation provided us with the widest color gamut which gives us/you the most vivid and stunning imagery.  DISCLAIMER: We are not affiliated, associated, authorized, endorsed by or in any way officially connected to the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). We don't have college licenses now but plan to apply for licenses after this campaign has been funded.",13.0,3,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi, I'm Scott Salzman! I have two cats (and one dog) who share my home and, for the past 16 years, I have been working full-time as an inventor. My products have won awards and been featured in/on the Today Show, Good Morning America, Real Simple Magazine, Better Homes &amp; Gardens, etc. </p>
<p>Throughout my inventing career, I’ve done lots of shipping. And that results in piles of boxes laying around for my cats to play with. I started keeping some in the house for my cats and they began choosing the boxes over the nice beds that I had purchased for them. Well, those boxes often were dirty from shipping, had labels on them, were too big/small etc. Basically, they looked lousy. That’s when I started designing, and the Purrfect Cat Box™ was born. </p>
<p>The Purrfect Cat Box is my newest project and it’s all set to manufacture. The box manufacturer is just down the road in Denver, CO and the project details have been worked out prior to the Kickstarter campaign launch. Therefore, I don’t anticipate any delays in shipping your Purrfect Cat Box(s). </p>

<p><strong>Is the box safe for my cat? </strong></p>
<p>Yes. Our cats have been using samples of these boxes for years. The inks used to print the box are compliant with Toxics in Packaging Clearinghouse (CONEG) regulations, as well as the Toy Safety Standard (ASTM F963).</p>
<p><strong>What size is the box? </strong></p>

<p><strong>When will you start shipping?</strong></p>
<p>We will start shipping the Purrfect Cat Box in October!</p>
<p><strong>Can you please explain your shipping costs?</strong> </p>
<p>We have done our best to keep costs as low as possible. In fact, we are absorbing 30% of the shipping costs. Shipping prices have drastically increased in the last years for small companies like us. It is a part of online shopping; if you are not paying for it directly, it is included in the cost of the product. We hope that you understand.</p>
<p><strong>Where are the boxes made?</strong> </p>
<p>Denver, Colorado, USA</p>
<p><strong>How long will my box last? </strong></p>
<p>That answer, of course, depends on your cat and if it has destructive tendencies. If it doesn’t get chewed up, puked in, etc. it can last for quite a while. Our first samples are about three years old and still in use. And the latest design is much sturdier than the original.</p>
<p><strong>Can I use the Purrfect Cat Box for my dog?</strong></p>
<p>Yes! We LOVE dogs and the box is the perfect size for small dogs. We felt the picture below was too cute not to share, so please enjoy! :)</p>

<h3><strong>What we need, and why<br/></strong></h3>
<p>The last two years HOOK has been developed on sparetime and private savings.<br/><br/>Now we are raising $20,000 mainly for the steel production tool (injection moulding) and to be able to place the order for the first batch of HOOKs.

device could be created to provide water to the sensitive and fragile new root
system of a plant in the first days of its life.</span><span> <br/>I visualized water droplet pictures and this became the direction for
the design of the Hydria Pot.<br/>The first design ideas emerged following research into ancient
knowledge and natural systems such as the desert beetle that harvest moisture from the air with the own body every morning to drink water and survive. </span><span></span></p><p></p><span></span><p><span>I then studied energy efficient technology that also has minimum
environmental impact, considering also locally sourced materials and simple
irrigation methods.<br/>The goal of the design was to create a simple, reusable, low
energy impact object made from natural materials.<br/>This resulted in the Hydria Pot - a locally sourced clay pot that
collects air moisture and stores water droplets.<br/></span></p><p></p><span></span><p></p><p></p><h2> Design concept:</h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/644006/files/20140612070259-concept.jpg?1402581779"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span>The project observed how animals and plants in different
bionetworks collected and used moisture from the air to survive.</span><span><br/>Morning dew is one of the most important resources for millions of

<p><span>As night temperatures drop, condensation will form on the upper
leafy part of the pot. Gravity driven water droplets will follow the metal
veins and conduct the condensation into the clay pot, where it will remain
until fully absorbed by the roots.</span><span><br/>To</span><span> optimise </span><span>the Hydria Pot, water can be added during dry spells.<br/>This porous pot can collect a reasonable amount of water which it
releases slowly during the following days; it requires no energy and no
maintenance.</span><span><br/>This is an energy free device that can water your plants, saving

It is designed to keep the roots of plants moist for longer
periods.The Story: While I was involved in a reforestation activity I realized that a
device could be created to provide water to the sensitive and fragile new root
system of a plant in the first days of its life. I visualized water droplet pictures and this became the direction for
the design of the Hydria Pot.The first design ideas emerged following research into ancient
knowledge and natural systems such as the desert beetle that harvest moisture from the air with the own body every morning to drink water and survive. I then studied energy efficient technology that also has minimum
environmental impact, considering also locally sourced materials and simple
irrigation methods.The goal of the design was to create a simple, reusable, low
energy impact object made from natural materials.This resulted in the Hydria Pot - a locally sourced clay pot that
collects air moisture and stores water droplets. Design concept:The project observed how animals and plants in different
bionetworks collected and used moisture from the air to survive.Morning dew is one of the most important resources for millions of
small animals and plants; providing nutrients and water needed to strive and
grow on this magnificent planet.
Morning dew also evaporates as the sun rises. How Hydria Pot works: 
The Hydria Pot is a Design mimicking Nature!
As night temperatures drop, condensation will form on the upper
leafy part of the pot. Gravity driven water droplets will follow the metal
veins and conduct the condensation into the clay pot, where it will remain
until fully absorbed by the roots.To optimise the Hydria Pot, water can be added during dry spells.This porous pot can collect a reasonable amount of water which it
releases slowly during the following days; it requires no energy and no
maintenance.This is an energy free device that can water your plants, saving
you time and money
It is the perfect gadget for your trees and plants!Using Hydria Pot indoor provides moisture to your plants for about 5 days Gardening tool for root moisture constant supply.Morning dew collector. Hydria Pot design schemeFundraising objectives:$31,000 total

The truth is many companies will claim to have high quality and ""pure""

sometimes diluted oils from countries like China.  Things like 
distilling methods, harvesting techniques, chemical free soils, and 
place of origin matter with essential oils.</p><p>When we launched Ovvio
 Oils earlier this year, our aim was to build the company the right way,
 and partner with the experienced premium sources to bring only the 
highest quality and most potent oils anywhere in the world to our 
customers.   We introduced our oils on Amazon.com just a few short 
months ago, to an audience who is notoriously critical and public with 
their opinions, <b>and the response has been overwhelming with over 140 (and counting) <i>mostly 5 Star Reviews</i> on Amazon (zero negatives so far)!  </b></p><p><i>As the adage suggests, when you build it, they will come, and boy did they come!</i></p><p>When people tried our first product called <b>Inhale Respiratory Blend, </b>word spread fast.  Even though we are one of the most expensive blends on 
the market (necessary for the premium ingredients we buy) we could 
hardly keep them on the shelves and our customers are demanding more. </p><h2><b>Why we need your help (and will make it worth your while)</b></h2><p>We
 want more than anything to give consumers what they're demanding, but 
as a true mom and pop startup, we don't have the capital to grow at 
anywhere near the rate we need to.   That's where the idea of 
crowdfunding came in. </p><h2></h2><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 38px; font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">What we want to develop for this Holiday Season</span></p><p>Our

<b>100% Pure Therapeutic Grade Peppermint</b>.  Remember what we said

<b>100% Pure Therapeutic Grade Frankincense</b>.  When we see other 
companies selling bottles of frankincense for under $10 we have to

sacred for its meditation enhancing and healing properties.  And today, 
the purest and most skillfully harvested and distilled frankincense oils still come from Egypt, which is where we go to import it. Experience

website:<i><br/></i></p><p><i>""I have been a massage therapist for over 14 years and have an 
extensive collection of single note essential oils and essential oil 
blends. I am very particular about the quality and aroma, and try to 
avoid large manufacturers who do not disclose where they harvest their 
oils. I decided to purchase this oil because the seller appears to be 
very knowledgeable about the healing properties and harvesting methods 
of his/her suppliers.""</i></p><p><b>And another enthusiastic customer:</b></p><p><i>""</i><i>I been using this essential oil blend in the bath with our 2 little 
boys. It is really a nice blend. As soon as I opened the bottle and 
smelled the oil, my sinuses opened right up. I would recommend using 
this in a cold air humidifier if your little one is congested or sick. 
In our house we like to always put a nice EO in the bath, so this works 
perfectly.""</i></p><p><b>Plus, here's a video testimonial:</b></p><p><i></i></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fz0LfOa6LXss%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dz0LfOa6LXss&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fz0LfOa6LXss%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><i><br/></i><p></p><p><b></b></p><h2><b>What Funding Goes For</b></h2><p></p><p>Because we are

Deficiency”</i>. This causes her several recurring lung and sinus infections
throughout the year, every year, along with other ailments that come with a
compromised immune system.  </p>
<p>Discouraged by the
effects over the counter medication was having on her liver, we set out to find
alternative treatments for her respiratory issues, because
taking too many over the counter medications such as pseudoephedrine causes
other side effects and is hard on the liver.  When we later got word that
her liver health is now suffering we set out to find other ways to treat her
sinus and lung difficulties.   That’s when our
association with essential oils started. We knew from our research about the questionable quality many products on the market. </p>
<p>Given Dayna’s
fragile health condition, we didn't want to use anything of questionable
quality or diluted to a point that its effectiveness diminishes. The only
way to be sure we used only premium quality therapeutic grade oils was to
source them ourselves. We also ensured they came only from the regions of the
world that had the specific soil conditions for each individual oil where it
grows best.</p>
<p>That is how Ovvio
Oils was born. ‘Ovvio’ is Italian for ""Obviously, or Naturally, and was
named for our love of Italy, the fact that we import oils from there, and
because turning to essential oils was the obvious choice in our situation.

their opinions, and the response has been overwhelming with over 140 (and counting) mostly 5 Star Reviews on Amazon (zero negatives so far)!  As the adage suggests, when you build it, they will come, and boy did they come!When people tried our first product called Inhale Respiratory Blend, word spread fast.  Even though we are one of the most expensive blends on 
the market (necessary for the premium ingredients we buy) we could 
hardly keep them on the shelves and our customers are demanding more. Why we need your help (and will make it worth your while)We
 want more than anything to give consumers what they're demanding, but 
as a true mom and pop startup, we don't have the capital to grow at 
anywhere near the rate we need to.   That's where the idea of 
crowdfunding came in. What we want to develop for this Holiday SeasonOur
 new Holiday Gift Set will be the perfect gift or just simply a kit to 
have in your own arsenal to prepare for the holidays.   Don't let yourself turn to chemical laden over the counter meds to combat your every ailment!  While
 those medicines have their place, they are extremely overused in our 
society, while natural alternatives are out there waiting to be taken 
advantage of.  The Holiday Set (MSRP $149) Includes
Inhale - Respiratory blend.  The one that started it all. Inhale, a potent blend of six essential oils from different corners of the world which is free of anything that could harm you, your children or 
our environment. Packed with the goodness of 100% Pure 
undiluted Eucalyptus, Peppermint, Lavender, Rosemary, Cedarwood and 
Clary Sage, Inhale will give you instant relief from allergies and 
seasonal diseases.  (MSRP $39.95)

Unwind - Stress Relief Blend.  With the power of eight essential 
oils which are perfectly blended by our experts of over 20 years, this 
blend will put you at ease instantly, with its calming effect on the 
mind and body.  Ingredients include Lavender, Bergamot,
Mandarin, Geranium, Clary Sage, Vanilla Elemi, Frankincense.  (MSRP 
$39.95)

100% Pure Therapeutic Grade Peppermint.  Remember what we said 
about not all oils being created equal?  That is certainly the case 
here.  Due to its extreme popularity, Peppermint oil is one of the most common oils
 for low standard companies mass produce, dilute, and knock off.   Rest 
assured that you will only get the best from us. Peppermint, which is 
one of the oldest medicines in the world, is a great cure for headaches,
 indigestion, and stomach problems,
and will surely get your home smelling amazing to get you in the mood 
for Christmastime!  (MSRP 29.95)

100% Pure Therapeutic Grade Frankincense.  When we see other 
companies selling bottles of frankincense for under $10 we have to 
cringe.    In ancient and biblical times, the Egyptians held this oil 
sacred for its meditation enhancing and healing properties.  And today, 
the purest and most skillfully harvested and distilled frankincense oils still come from Egypt, which is where we go to import it. Experience 
Egyptian Frankincense for yourself, you will be amazed. (MSRP $49.95)
What They're SayingAs we stated, the response to our oils has been tremendous in just a short period of time! Here's one testimonial from our Ovvio Oils 
website:""I have been a massage therapist for over 14 years and have an 
extensive collection of single note essential oils and essential oil 
blends. I am very particular about the quality and aroma, and try to 
avoid large manufacturers who do not disclose where they harvest their 
oils. I decided to purchase this oil because the seller appears to be 
very knowledgeable about the healing properties and harvesting methods 
of his/her suppliers.""And another enthusiastic customer:""I been using this essential oil blend in the bath with our 2 little 
boys. It is really a nice blend. As soon as I opened the bottle and 
smelled the oil, my sinuses opened right up. I would recommend using 
this in a cold air humidifier if your little one is congested or sick. 
In our house we like to always put a nice EO in the bath, so this works 
perfectly.""Plus, here's a video testimonial:What Funding Goes ForBecause we are 
committed to not compromise on the top of the industry standards we 
adhere to when creating new essential oil products, development and 
sourcing costs are high for us. This gift set alone will cost over $20,000 to bring to the market.  
 We're looking for backers to help us make this product a reality, and 
any funding above what is needed for the gift set will be poured into 
the development of new and completely unique essential oil blends.What's Next for Ovvio Oils?We've been hard at work with our 
expert botanical oil development team dreaming up dozens of new products
 for 2014 and 2015.  We already have over twenty new formulas and single
 oils in the works, and would love to expand into many major offline 
retailers who have heard of our product yet demand high inventories.A preview of things to come once the funding is available:
A Relaxation Blend
A Mood Enhancement Blend
A Sleep Help Blend
A Pain Relief Blend
A Germ Fighter Blend
A Muscle Relaxer Blend
A Natural Hand Sanitizer Blend
Just as we've turned heads with Inhale, we plan to make a big statement with each and every new blend to come.   Besides their effectiveness, we make each and every one smell amazing!  Which you'll appreciate if you've ever bought some the mass produced essential oil blends in the past.  About Ovvio OilsIn 2008, Dayna was diagnosed with a condition called ""Common Variable Immune
Deficiency”. This causes her several recurring lung and sinus infections
throughout the year, every year, along with other ailments that come with a
compromised immune system.  
Discouraged by the
effects over the counter medication was having on her liver, we set out to find
alternative treatments for her respiratory issues, because
taking too many over the counter medications such as pseudoephedrine causes
other side effects and is hard on the liver.  When we later got word that
her liver health is now suffering we set out to find other ways to treat her
sinus and lung difficulties.   That’s when our
association with essential oils started. We knew from our research about the questionable quality many products on the market. 
Given Dayna’s
fragile health condition, we didn't want to use anything of questionable
quality or diluted to a point that its effectiveness diminishes. The only
way to be sure we used only premium quality therapeutic grade oils was to
source them ourselves. We also ensured they came only from the regions of the
world that had the specific soil conditions for each individual oil where it
grows best.
That is how Ovvio
Oils was born. ‘Ovvio’ is Italian for ""Obviously, or Naturally, and was
named for our love of Italy, the fact that we import oils from there, and
because turning to essential oils was the obvious choice in our situation.
 An amazing advocacy group for her condition is the Immune Deficiency Foundation (IDF) http://primaryimmune.org/.  And in support of this foundation, 5% of all proceeds from this campaign will be donated to IDF.  We are committed to helping others the same way we have been helped by finding natural healing through essential oils.  Check out the incredible reward packages we've put together for you!  Help us grow our company and make our mission a reality.  Thank you for your interest. Check out our products here and
connect with our social media family here. 
Thank you in advance for helping to bring clean safe and effective essential oils from our home to yours!",5.0,1,"1 Campaign

they sold our building and we have to move!  And soon!!</span><br/></p>
<p>I
got this news about a week before my vacation in Maui and to tell you the truth
it knocked me right off my center…. for about 2 days…. What are we going to do?….
Where are we going to go?…… Then I woke up…..</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Hi I
am Reverend Gayle Dillon </b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">and if you had told me twelve years ago I
would be the Senior Minister for a growing spiritual community in Santa Fe, NM
I would have thought you were nuts and not very grounded in reality. Truth is
twelve years ago I was a high functioning drug addict/alcoholic working in
corporate America and living in Seattle. 
Then in September, 2002 I walked into Center for Spiritual Living –
Eastside in Kirkland WA and the experience changed my life. I started taking
classes, </span><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>all</b></i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> the classes, I actually
devoured the classes and said “YES” to
the new me. I am proud to say my sobriety date is October 19, 2002. I became a Practitioner. I
met the love of my life (I mention that because he is our music director now). In
2010 I graduated from the Holmes Institute and opened Everyday Center for
Spiritual Living in Santa Fe, NM. Of course there are lots more details to my story, but
this isn’t about me.</span></p>

<p>We’ve only been in our current building for 6 months
and fixed it up soooo beautifully and everybody loves it!</p>

<p>We have already moved 3 times since starting
in our living room in Sept 2010 and affordable spaces are really hard to find

<p>The
Center is named Everyday Center for Spiritual Living (ECSL) for a specific
reason. Our intention is to be that place where people can gather <i>Everyday. </i>A place they want to be <i>Everyday</i> and a place where people grow and have
community. ECSL is meant to be an <i>Everyday</i> experience. The intent of ECSL is to
build community, offer pastoral care programs and be an active member of the
Santa Fe community through outreach programs. The Center is ""out of the
box"" in its design and feel. When you walk into the Center you enter into a bookstore and coffee
house with comfy couches and a place to hang. The stage doubles as a venue for local
and touring musicians, open mics, and poetry slams. In addition the
bookstore and coffee house will provide us with a financial flow to aid in the
support of all the programs we envision providing to our community and to the
Santa Fe area. There is a meditation/prayer room where people can drop by
throughout the day to pray, to meditate or to just sit with the Divine in
silence. There is a room for movement.  To
engage body, mind and spirit; be it yoga or tai chi or other forms of exercise
that embodies being physical while staying grounded and connected. And many
more possibilities. Of course there is the sanctuary for Sunday and weekday
services plus events like Spiritual Talk Series, Spiritual Cinema and seminars
of all kinds. We envision events that bring our community together and spread
the ideas of this philosophy throughout the greater Santa Fe area.  We want people to come to our Center
regardless of where they spend their Sundays. Yes we hope through all these offerings
people will be drawn to our Sunday Spiritual Gatherings but more importantly is
opening up this philosophy to people in entirely new empowering ways. </p><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p></p>I have NO idea how to

they sold our building and we have to move!  And soon!!
I
got this news about a week before my vacation in Maui and to tell you the truth
it knocked me right off my center…. for about 2 days…. What are we going to do?….
Where are we going to go?…… Then I woke up…..

Hi I
am Reverend Gayle Dillon and if you had told me twelve years ago I
would be the Senior Minister for a growing spiritual community in Santa Fe, NM
I would have thought you were nuts and not very grounded in reality. Truth is
twelve years ago I was a high functioning drug addict/alcoholic working in
corporate America and living in Seattle. 
Then in September, 2002 I walked into Center for Spiritual Living –
Eastside in Kirkland WA and the experience changed my life. I started taking
classes, all the classes, I actually
devoured the classes and said “YES” to
the new me. I am proud to say my sobriety date is October 19, 2002. I became a Practitioner. I
met the love of my life (I mention that because he is our music director now). In
2010 I graduated from the Holmes Institute and opened Everyday Center for
Spiritual Living in Santa Fe, NM. Of course there are lots more details to my story, but
this isn’t about me.
What are we going to do?!  
We’ve only been in our current building for 6 months
and fixed it up soooo beautifully and everybody loves it!
Where are we going to go?!
We have already moved 3 times since starting
in our living room in Sept 2010 and affordable spaces are really hard to find
in Santa Fe!
Then I woke up!!
OMG what an opportunity to play bigger, to
have more impact, to walk our talk and not shrink from change.  Then a building fell into our laps almost out
of the blue.  I actually looked at this same
building 3 years ago but we weren’t ready for each other.  But now we are both single and the sparks

This is made with you in mind. Sensitive skin does not like irritants. There are three types of skin irritations caused by bedding textiles: chemical irritation (synthetic dyes, pesticides or polyester), pathogenic irritation (bed mites, bacteria, fungi) or mechanical irritation (friction through rough material). Aizome Bedding uses zero synthetic chemicals, is naturally strong against pathogens and woven in fine sateen for a smooth finish. You can lay your skin concerns to rest.</p><p><strong>I am allergic to dust, is this for me?</strong><br/>Yes, this is made for you. Bed mites, whose feces are a major cause for allergic reactions, do not like indigo or cotton (they thrive in synthetic material like blended polymer textiles).</p><p><strong>Can I experience allergic reaction to indigo or cotton?</strong><br/>Both are highly unlikely. Our product is classified as hypoallergenic, meaning unlikely to cause any allergic reactions. We use only indigo and untreated cotton, and neither has been linked to any common allergic reaction. </p><p><strong>Will this cure my diseases?</strong><br/>Skin diseases, like most others, do not have a single cause but are rather the expression of a complex mechanism of internal and external factors. So, the sensible answer is “no”. But a healthy sleeping environment prevents further strain and helps your body while it recovers.</p><p><strong>I hate bed mites</strong><br/>So do we. But bed mites love your polyester pillow cover. One third of the weight of a five-year-old pillow can be dead mites and their poop. Good thing that Aizome Bedding is naturally antibacterial.</p><p><strong>Is this safe for children?</strong><br/>Yes. We work along international guidelines to qualify our products to be safe for toddlers and infants.</p><p><strong>Are conventional textiles really as dangerous to your health as you claim?</strong><br/>Focus has been put on the release of hazardous chemicals into the environment and there is today a well-known environmental problem caused by the textile industry. However, substances remaining in finished textile products, in daily close contact with the body, have been neglected as a potential risk to human health. The hazards posed by such substances are primarily skin sensitization and irritation, but also reproduction toxicity, and proved or suspected carcinogenicity.</p><ul>

It is ranked within the highest level of color fastness. Direct sunlight over a long period of time may lead to a slight change in color in some cases.We also conducted a 100 times wash test in a standard washing machine. No color change whatsoever was noticeable. Have a look:</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/ftMDsZz721Q?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0"" width=""560""></iframe></div><p></p><p><strong>Will the color rub off?</strong><br/>No. This has been tested at a laboratory and the indigo color stays where it should.</p><p><strong>Can I dry clean Aizome Bedding?</strong><br/>Yes. The color will not be affected.</p><p><strong>Does the natural dye have a smell?</strong><br/>When the bed sheets are wet, for example when you take them out of the washing machine, you notice a flowery scent. This is the smell of natural indigo.</p><p><strong>Simply, what is Aizome?</strong><br/>Aizome is the Japanese word for dyeing textile with natural indigo. This is done by fermenting the leaves of the indigo plant. The number of dips in the dye vat determines how dark the blue will be.</p><p><strong>How did you achieve such colorfastness?</strong><br/>The basic process is traditional: We use only cotton, indigo and water. We enhance this with a novel sonic wave technology. Sonic energy is sound waves with frequencies above 20,000 oscillations per second. In liquid, these high-frequency waves cause the formation of microscopic bubbles. Collapsing bubbles generate tiny but powerful shock waves which results in high-velocity microjets directed towards the solid surface of the yarn. These microjets can give rise to intra-yarn flow, increase in the rate of the mass transfer between the intra-yarn and inter-yarn pores. The result is highly colorfast textiles made without any chemicals.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between ‘indigo’ and ‘natural indigo’?</strong><br/>Natural indigo is what humans used until the invention of chemical indigo (also known as synthetic indigo) by Adolf von Baeyer in the 1880s. Chemical indigo is by now used almost exclusively. The name ‘indigo’ is now used for the color, not the plant. As far as we know, no other company produces natural indigo products on a large scale.</p><p><strong>Is this indigo the same as in my jeans?</strong><br/>If your jeans were made before the 1880s, then yes. If not, chances are high that your jeans are dyed with synthetic indigo, also called aniline, which in its pure form is highly toxic. Today natural dyes have almost disappeared from the market.</p><p> </p><h3>Product</h3><h3> </h3><p><strong>Is your product certified?</strong><br/>Since we are in what is called “concept stage” we do not have a certification as of now. However, we use GOTS-certified organic cotton, we produce in a facility which is OEKO-TEX certified and our final products are inspected by a large Japanese textile institute called QTEC to meet the highest textile standards.</p><p><strong>My size is not available. Can you help?</strong><br/>Please email us and we will be happy to help you find your size. </p><p><strong>I want this, but in another color.</strong><br/>We will make other aizome blue hues available if we reach the $150,000 stretch goal, or at a later stage.</p><p><strong>Can I give this as a present?</strong><br/>Absolutely, we take great care in the packaging and this will make a beautiful long-lasting present.</p><p><strong>Where do you ship from?</strong><br/>We ship from Yantai China, where the bed sets are being tailored in a facility we manage.</p><p><strong>Is your bedding made entirely in Japan?</strong><br/>No, we also produce in China under controlled conditions. Rest assured that every stage of our production meets the highest quality standards. The quality management, review process, and safety inspections are all managed or done in Japan.</p><p><strong>If I use another product that is OEKO-TEX 100, doesn’t it have the same benefits?</strong><br/>No. This means that the product was cleaned and checked for 100 known toxic chemicals. Aizome Bedding, however, has never even been in touch with such toxins and nothing had to be washed out. This saves tons of water and lets you sleep even better.</p><p><strong>How long do these sheets last?</strong><br/>Potentially forever. Some of the oldest surviving fabrics are dyed with natural indigo. We have refrained from using any wear-and-tear parts like zippers, buttons or rubber bands. These might be the last sheets you’ll ever need.</p><p><strong>How should I take care of my Aizome Bedding sheets?</strong><br/>To maintain the soft and comfortable natural feeling, we recommend following these care instructions: do not bleach, do not tumble dry, lay flat to dry, iron with low heat, and wash at up to 60°C.</p><p><strong>Do I have to pay VAT / GST?</strong><br/>As common with all projects on indiegogo or similar platforms, the recipient is the importer of record and must comply with all laws and regulations of their local government. Orders shipped may be subject to import taxes, customs duties and fees levied by your country. Additional charges for customs clearance must be fulfilled by the recipient. Aizome Bedding has no control over these charges.</p><p><strong>I have backed other campaigns and never got my products. Will you let me down?</strong><br/>No, never! You are our number one priority.

</ul><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Geschichte von Aizome</strong></p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Eine alte japanische Kunst blüht neu auf</h2><h2> </h2><p>Aizome ist die traditionelle japanische Kunst des Färbens von Stoffen mit natürlichem Indigo, einer Heilpflanze mit antibakteriellen und entzündungshemmenden Eigenschaften für die Haut. Bereits die Samurai benutzten mit Indigo gefärbte Stoffe unter ihrer Rüstung, um Wunden zu heilen, Babys wurden in ein Indigo-Tuch gewickelt und viele Menschen schliefen auf Aizome-Bettwäsche. Neben seinen hautpflegenden Eigenschaften waren diese Stoffe völlig organisch und abfallfrei. Allerdings wurde der natürliche Indigo später durch billigeres und schädliches synthetisches Indigo ersetzt, und die Kunst von Aizome starb mehr oder weniger aus. Wir möchten sie zu ihrem früheren Glanz wiederbeleben und in dein Schlafzimmer bringen.<br/> <br/> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Warum Textilien wichtig sind</strong></p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Dein Körper reagiert auf alles, was deine Haut berührt</h2><h2> </h2><p>Die Haut ist keine Barriere. Es ist das größte Organ deines Körpers. Es absorbiert eine große Menge von dem, was es berührt. Textilien minderer Qualität reizen die Haut mit Giftstoffen und verhindern eine gute Atmung.<br/>Chemikalien, die in billigen Gewebefarbstoffen wie Schwermetallen oder Chlorbenzolen verwendet werden, können durch deine Haut aufgenommen werden und sich in deinen Organen wie Nieren und Leber ansammeln und dein zentrales Nervensystem beeinflussen.</p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Vorteil von Aizome-Bettwäsche</strong></p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Aizome beruhigt deine Haut im Schlaf</h2><h2> </h2><h3>Natürlicher Indigo-Farbstoff</h3><p><strong>Seit Jahrhunderten bewehrt</strong><br/>Die aktiven Bestandteile von Indigo – Tyrptanthrin und Isatin – haben positive Auswirkungen auf Entzündungen. Die Römer verwendeten häufig Indigo für seine medizinischen Eigenschaften. In Japan gilt es seit Jahrhunderten zudem als zuverlässiges Mittel, um Insekten und Infektionen gleichermaßen abzuwehren.</p><p> </p><h3>Bio-Baumwolle</h3><p><strong>Sayonara, Bettmilben</strong><br/>Bio-Baumwolle bietet unwirtlichen Bedingungen für Bettmilben und andere Mikroben (wie Pilze), die deine Haut reizen oder allergische Reaktionen hervorrufen können.</p><p> </p><h3>Sauberes Wasser</h3><p><strong>Keine Chemikalien</strong><br/>Heutzutage verwenden fast alle Textilhersteller chemische Farbstoffe. Diese sind durch die Freisetzung von stark verschmutztem Abwasser extrem umweltschädlich, zudem stellen sie ernsthafte Gesundheitsrisiken für die Verbraucher dar.</p><p> </p><h3>Satingewebe</h3><p><strong>Zuverlässig gegen Alterung</strong><br/>Die hohe Fadenzahl (400) und das Satingewebe erzeugen fantastisch weiche und sanfte Bettlaken für ein geschmeidiges Gefühl von Kopf bis Fuß. Die seidige Oberfläche beugt Haarbruch und krausem Haar vor, denn die Reibung zwischen deinem Haar und dem Kissenbezug ist deutlich reduziert. Mit Satin-Bettwäsche gibt es auch keine Linienabdrücke auf deiner Haut.

Aizome Bedding ist wie für dich gemacht. Empfindliche Haut mag keine Reizstoffe. Es gibt drei Arten von Hautirritationen, die durch Bettwäsche verursacht werden: chemische Reizung (synthetische Farbstoffe, Pestizide oder Polyester), pathogene Irritation (Bettmilben, Bakterien, Pilze) oder mechanische Reizung (Reibung durch raues Material). Aizome Bedding verwendet keine synthetischen Chemikalien, wirkt natürlich gegen Krankheitserreger, und ist in glattem Satin gewebt. Damit kannst du deine Hautprobleme zur Ruhe legen. <br/> <br/><strong>Ich bin allergisch gegen Staub, ist Aizome Bedding für mich?</strong><br/>Ja, absolut. Bettmilben, deren Kot eine Hauptursache für allergische Reaktionen ist, mögen weder Indigo noch Baumwolle (sie gedeihen in synthetischem Material wie gemischte Polymertextilien).<br/> <br/><strong>Kann es eine allergische Reaktion auf Indigo oder Baumwolle geben?</strong><br/>Beides ist höchst unwahrscheinlich. Unser Produkt wird als „hypoallergen“ eingestuft, was bedeutet, dass es keine allergischen Reaktionen hervorrufen kann. Wir verwenden nur Indigo und unbehandelte Baumwolle, die nicht mit allergischen Reaktion in Verbindung gebracht werden.<br/> <br/><strong>Wird diese Bettwäsche meine Hautkrankheiten lindern?</strong><br/>Hauterkrankungen haben wie die meisten anderen keine einzige Ursache, sondern sind das Ergebnis einer komplexen Mischung von inneren und externen Faktoren. Die vernünftige Antwort ist also „nein“. Aber eine gesunde Umgebung – wie ein gesundes Bett – vermeidet weitere Belastungen und hilft deinem Körper, während er sich nachts erholt.<br/> <br/><strong>Ich hasse Bettmilben.</strong><br/>Wir auch. Aber Bettmilben lieben deinen Polyester-Kissenbezug. Ein Drittel des Gewichts eines fünf-Jahre-alten Kissens können tote Milben und deren Kot sein. Gut, dass Aizome Bedding natürlich antibakteriell ist.<br/> <br/><strong>Ist das für Kinder sicher?</strong><br/>Ja. Wir arbeiten nach internationalen Richtlinien, um unsere Produkte als unbedenklich für Kleinkinder einstufen zu lassen.<br/> <br/><strong>Sind konventionelle Textilien wirklich so gesundheitsgefährdend, wie Ihr behauptet?</strong><br/>Der Schwerpunkt liegt auf der Freisetzung gefährlicher Chemikalien in die Umwelt. Die Umweltprobleme, die durch die Verschmutzung seitens der Textilindustrie entstehen, sind heute weit bekannt. Stoffe, die in fertigen Textilprodukten täglich im engen Kontakt mit dem Körper sind, wurden jedoch als potentielles Risiko für die menschliche Gesundheit vernachlässigt. Die Gefahren, die von solchen Substanzen ausgehen, sind hauptsächlich Hautsensibilisierung und -reizung, aber auch Reproduktionstoxizität und nachgewiesene oder vermutete Karzinogenität.<br/> <br/><strong>Wie fühlt sich Aizome Bedding an?</strong><br/>Super weich.<br/> <br/><strong>Kann ich es mit einer anderen Farbe waschen?</strong><br/>Ja, unser Produkt ist farbecht und erfordert keine besondere Pflege.<br/> <br/><strong>Wird die Farbe verblassen?</strong><br/>Der Stoff wird hier in Tokio in jeder Kategorie getestet. Es ist auf dem höchsten Niveau der Farbechtheit eingestuft. Direktes Sonnenlicht über einen längeren Zeitraum kann in einigen Fällen zu leichten Farbveränderungen führen.<br/> <br/><strong>Wird die Farbe abfärben?</strong><br/>Nein. Dies wurde in einem Labor getestet und die Indigo-Farbe bleibt dort, wo sie ist.<br/> <br/><strong>Kann ich Aizome Bettwäsche in die Reinigung geben?</strong><br/>Ja. Die Farbe wird nicht beeinflusst.<br/> <br/><strong>Hat der natürliche Farbstoff einen Geruch?</strong><br/>Wenn die Bettwäsche nass ist, zum Beispiel wenn Sie sie aus der Waschmaschine kommt, riecht sie etwas blumig. Dies ist der Geruch von natürlichem Indigo.<br/> <br/><strong>Was ist Aizome?</strong><br/>Aizome ist das japanische Wort für Textilfärbung mit natürlichem Indigo. Dies geschieht durch Fermentieren der Blätter der Indigo-Pflanze. Mit jedem Eintauchen des Stoffes in die Farbe wird das Blau intensiver.  <br/> <br/><strong>Wie habt Ihr eine solche Farbechtheit erreicht?</strong><br/>Tradition ist unsere Grundlage: Wir verwenden nur Baumwolle, Indigo und Wasser. Wir verbessern dies mit einer neuartigen Schallwellen-Technologie. „Sonic Energie“ ist Schallwellen mit Frequenzen über 20.000 Schwingungen pro Sekunde. In Flüssigkeit verursachen diese Hochfrequenzwellen die Bildung von mikroskopischen Blasen. Kollabierende Blasen erzeugen winzige, aber starke Stoßwellen, die zu Mikrostrahlen mit hoher Geschwindigkeit führen, die auf die feste Oberfläche des Garns gerichtet sind. Diese Mikrostrahlen können zu einer Intra-Garnströmung führen, wodurch die Rate des Stoffaustauschs zwischen den Intra-Garn- und Inter-Garn-Poren erhöht wird. Das Ergebnis sind farbechte Textilien ohne Chemie.<br/> <br/><strong>Was ist der Unterschied zwischen „Indigo“ und „natürlichem Indigo“?</strong><br/>Natürliches Indigo ist das, was Menschen bis zur Erfindung des chemischen Indigos von Adolf von Baeyer in den 1880ern verwendeten. Chemischer Indigo wird mittlerweile fast ausschließlich verwendet. Der Name „Indigo: wird nur noch für die Farbe verwendet, nicht für die Pflanze. Soweit wir wissen, produziert kein anderes Unternehmen natürliche Indigo-Produkte in großem Umfang.<br/> <br/><strong>Ist das Indigo dasselbe wie in meiner Jeans?</strong><br/>Wenn deine Jeans vor 1880 hergestellt wurde, ja. Wenn nicht, ist die Wahrscheinlichkeit groß, dass Deine Jeans mit synthetischem Indigo, auch Anilin genannt, gefärbt wird, das in seiner reinen Form hochgiftig ist. Heute sind natürliche Farbstoffe fast vom Markt verschwunden.</p><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Produkt</h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3><p><strong>Ist Euer Produkt zertifiziert?</strong><br/>Da wir in der sogenannten Konzeptphase sind, haben wir derzeit noch keine Zertifizierung. Wir verwenden jedoch GOTS-zertifizierte Bio-Baumwolle, produzieren in einer OEKO TEX-zertifizierten Anlage, und unsere Endprodukte werden von einem großen japanischen Textilinstitut namens QTEC auf höchste Standards geprüft.<br/> <br/><strong>Meine Größe ist nicht verfügbar. </strong><br/>Bitte schick uns eine E-Mail und wir helfen gern, deine Größe zu finden.<br/> <br/><strong>Ich hätte gern eine andere Farbe.</strong><br/>Wir werden andere Blautöne zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt produzieren. <br/> <br/><strong>Ist das als Geschenk passend?</strong><br/>Absolut, wir achten sehr auf die Verpackung und Aizome Bedding ist ein tolles, langlebiges Geschenk.<br/> <br/><strong>Von wo liefert Ihr?</strong><br/>Wir liefern aus Yantai in China, wo die Sets in einer von uns verwalteten Anlage maßgeschneidert werden.<br/> <br/><strong>Wird dies in Japan gemacht?</strong><br/>Nein, wir produzieren auch in China unter kontrollierten Bedingungen. Du kannst uns aber vertrauen, dass wir in jeder Hinsicht höchste Qualität produzieren. Das Qualitätsmanagement, Überprüfungsprozess und Sicherheitsinspektionen werden alle in Japan verwaltet oder durchgeführt.<br/> <br/><strong>Wenn ich ein anderes Produkt verwende, das OEKO-TEXT 100 ist, ist das nicht das Gleiche?</strong><br/>Nein. Dies bedeutet, dass das Produkt gereinigt und auf 100 bekannte giftige Chemikalien überprüft wurde. Aizome Bedding war jedoch noch nie in Kontakt mit solchen Giftstoffen und damit musste auch nichts ausgewaschen werden. Das spart Tonnen Wasser und lässt dich noch ruhiger schlafen.<br/> <br/><strong>Wie lange hält diese Bettwäsche?</strong><br/>Möglicherweise für immer. Einige der ältesten überlebenden Stoffe sind mit natürlichem Indigo gefärbt. Auf Verschleißteile wie Reißverschlüsse, Knöpfe oder Gummibänder haben wir verzichtet. Vielleicht sind dies die letzten Laken, die du jemals brauchst.<br/> <br/><strong>Wie wasche ich mich um meine Aizome-Bettwäsche?</strong><br/>Um das weiche und natürliche Gefühl zu erhalten, empfehlen wir folgende Pflegehinweise: nicht bleichen, nicht im Trockner trocknen, flach zum Trocknen auslegen, bei niedriger Hitze bügeln und bei bis zu 60 ° C waschen.</p><p><strong>Muss ich auf den Import Steuer oder Gebühren bezahlen?</strong><br/>Leider haben wir keine Kontrolle ob der Zoll eine Einfuhrsteuer erhebt oder nicht. Generell ist es bei Indiegogo und anderen Plattformen üblich, dass der Kunde die volle Verantwortung trägt sowohl Mehrwertsteuer als auch alle anderen anfallenden Gebühren in seinem zu bezahlen.<br/> <br/><strong>Ich habe andere Kampagnen unterstützt und meine Produkte nie erhalten. Wirst du mich auch enttäuschen?</strong><br/>Nein niemals! Du bist unsere Nummer eins. Wir haben Erfahrung in Fertigung und Qualitätsmanagement. Wir sind über dieses Projekt hinaus ehrgeizig und möchten mit Deiner Unterstützung ein Unternehmen aufbauen, das gut für Deine Gesundheit und die Umwelt ist. Du erhältst deine Aizome Bettwäsche und wir sind für Dich da.</p></div>","CLICK HERE TO BE FORWARDED​Aizome is the traditional Japanese art of dyeing fabrics with natural indigo, a medicinal plant with great antibacterial and anti-inflammatory benefits to the skin. Samurai used it under their armor to help heal wounds, babies were wrapped in aizome cloth and people slept on aizome bed sheets. Besides its skin-treating qualities, it was completely organic and waste-free. But as natural indigo was later replaced by cheaper – and much more harmful – synthetic indigo, aizome fell into oblivion. We want to resurrect it to its former glory and bring it into your bedroom.The skin is not a barrierIt is the largest organ of your body. It absorbs a huge amount of what it touches. Low-quality textiles irritate your skin with toxins and prevent proper breathing. Chemicals used in cheap fabric dyes, such as heavy metals or chlorobenzenes, can be absorbed through your skin and accumulate in your organs, such as kidneys and liver, and affect your central nervous system.
 

Trusted for agesThe active components of indigo – tyrptanthrin and isatin – have positive effects on inflammation. Many ancient civilizations used indigo for its medicinal properties and it played a prominent role in Japan for centuries, used to ward off insects and infections alike. 


Sayonara, bed mites Organic cotton offers inhospitable conditions for bed mites and other microbes (such as fungi) can irritate your skin or cause allergic reactions.


No chemicalsToday virtually all textile products use chemical dyes. These have continuously been exposed to not only destroy the environment by releasing heavily polluted waste water, but pose serious health risks to consumers.


No friction, no wrinkles The high thread count (400) and sateen weave create the softest and smoothest sateen bed sheets, with a lustrous look and feel from head to toe. The silky surface helps cut down on hair breakage and frizzy hair as a result of friction between your hair and the pillow case. Sateen bed sheets also leave no lines on your skin and are known to prevent premature ageing of the skin. 
Our team members have years of professional experience in healthcare, textiles, quality management, dermatology and traditional Japanese dyeing. Most of us live in Tokyo but we have cultural backgrounds from Germany, Spain, Japan, Sweden and India.Using our expertise in healthcare, textiles, design, quality management and dermatology, we want to bring aizome into your bedroom in an affordable and environmentally friendly way.We need you!We have carefully selected partners and are ready to start. All leg-work is done, but now we need you. We need your orders to collect at least $10,000 to start our first production batch.Health I have very sensitive skin, is this for me?Absolutely. This is made with you in mind. Sensitive skin does not like irritants. There are three types of skin irritations caused by bedding textiles: chemical irritation (synthetic dyes, pesticides or polyester), pathogenic irritation (bed mites, bacteria, fungi) or mechanical irritation (friction through rough material). Aizome Bedding uses zero synthetic chemicals, is naturally strong against pathogens and woven in fine sateen for a smooth finish. You can lay your skin concerns to rest.I am allergic to dust, is this for me?Yes, this is made for you. Bed mites, whose feces are a major cause for allergic reactions, do not like indigo or cotton (they thrive in synthetic material like blended polymer textiles).Can I experience allergic reaction to indigo or cotton?Both are highly unlikely. Our product is classified as hypoallergenic, meaning unlikely to cause any allergic reactions. We use only indigo and untreated cotton, and neither has been linked to any common allergic reaction. Will this cure my diseases?Skin diseases, like most others, do not have a single cause but are rather the expression of a complex mechanism of internal and external factors. So, the sensible answer is “no”. But a healthy sleeping environment prevents further strain and helps your body while it recovers.I hate bed mitesSo do we. But bed mites love your polyester pillow cover. One third of the weight of a five-year-old pillow can be dead mites and their poop. Good thing that Aizome Bedding is naturally antibacterial.Is this safe for children?Yes. We work along international guidelines to qualify our products to be safe for toddlers and infants.Are conventional textiles really as dangerous to your health as you claim?Focus has been put on the release of hazardous chemicals into the environment and there is today a well-known environmental problem caused by the textile industry. However, substances remaining in finished textile products, in daily close contact with the body, have been neglected as a potential risk to human health. The hazards posed by such substances are primarily skin sensitization and irritation, but also reproduction toxicity, and proved or suspected carcinogenicity.

How does Aizome Bedding feel?Super amazingly soft. Color Can I wash this with other colors?Yes, our products are highly colorfast and no special care is required.Will the color fade?The fabric is tested here in Tokyo in every category. It is ranked within the highest level of color fastness. Direct sunlight over a long period of time may lead to a slight change in color in some cases.We also conducted a 100 times wash test in a standard washing machine. No color change whatsoever was noticeable. Have a look:Will the color rub off?No. This has been tested at a laboratory and the indigo color stays where it should.Can I dry clean Aizome Bedding?Yes. The color will not be affected.Does the natural dye have a smell?When the bed sheets are wet, for example when you take them out of the washing machine, you notice a flowery scent. This is the smell of natural indigo.Simply, what is Aizome?Aizome is the Japanese word for dyeing textile with natural indigo. This is done by fermenting the leaves of the indigo plant. The number of dips in the dye vat determines how dark the blue will be.How did you achieve such colorfastness?The basic process is traditional: We use only cotton, indigo and water. We enhance this with a novel sonic wave technology. Sonic energy is sound waves with frequencies above 20,000 oscillations per second. In liquid, these high-frequency waves cause the formation of microscopic bubbles. Collapsing bubbles generate tiny but powerful shock waves which results in high-velocity microjets directed towards the solid surface of the yarn. These microjets can give rise to intra-yarn flow, increase in the rate of the mass transfer between the intra-yarn and inter-yarn pores. The result is highly colorfast textiles made without any chemicals.What is the difference between ‘indigo’ and ‘natural indigo’?Natural indigo is what humans used until the invention of chemical indigo (also known as synthetic indigo) by Adolf von Baeyer in the 1880s. Chemical indigo is by now used almost exclusively. The name ‘indigo’ is now used for the color, not the plant. As far as we know, no other company produces natural indigo products on a large scale.Is this indigo the same as in my jeans?If your jeans were made before the 1880s, then yes. If not, chances are high that your jeans are dyed with synthetic indigo, also called aniline, which in its pure form is highly toxic. Today natural dyes have almost disappeared from the market. Product Is your product certified?Since we are in what is called “concept stage” we do not have a certification as of now. However, we use GOTS-certified organic cotton, we produce in a facility which is OEKO-TEX certified and our final products are inspected by a large Japanese textile institute called QTEC to meet the highest textile standards.My size is not available. Can you help?Please email us and we will be happy to help you find your size. I want this, but in another color.We will make other aizome blue hues available if we reach the $150,000 stretch goal, or at a later stage.Can I give this as a present?Absolutely, we take great care in the packaging and this will make a beautiful long-lasting present.Where do you ship from?We ship from Yantai China, where the bed sets are being tailored in a facility we manage.Is your bedding made entirely in Japan?No, we also produce in China under controlled conditions. Rest assured that every stage of our production meets the highest quality standards. The quality management, review process, and safety inspections are all managed or done in Japan.If I use another product that is OEKO-TEX 100, doesn’t it have the same benefits?No. This means that the product was cleaned and checked for 100 known toxic chemicals. Aizome Bedding, however, has never even been in touch with such toxins and nothing had to be washed out. This saves tons of water and lets you sleep even better.How long do these sheets last?Potentially forever. Some of the oldest surviving fabrics are dyed with natural indigo. We have refrained from using any wear-and-tear parts like zippers, buttons or rubber bands. These might be the last sheets you’ll ever need.How should I take care of my Aizome Bedding sheets?To maintain the soft and comfortable natural feeling, we recommend following these care instructions: do not bleach, do not tumble dry, lay flat to dry, iron with low heat, and wash at up to 60°C.Do I have to pay VAT / GST?As common with all projects on indiegogo or similar platforms, the recipient is the importer of record and must comply with all laws and regulations of their local government. Orders shipped may be subject to import taxes, customs duties and fees levied by your country. Additional charges for customs clearance must be fulfilled by the recipient. Aizome Bedding has no control over these charges.I have backed other campaigns and never got my products. Will you let me down?No, never! You are our number one priority. We have experience in manufacturing and quality management. We are ambitious beyond this single project and together with your support we want to build a company that is good to your health and the environment. You will get your Aizome Bedding and we will be there for you.  Deutsche VersionOrganische Indigo-Bettwäsche, die deine Haut pflegt Natürliche Indigo-gefärbte Baumwollbettwäsche für einen erholsamen Schlaf, inspiriert von japanischer Tradition.Aizome Bedding kombiniert die alte japanische Kunst der Indigofärbung mit einem modernen, innovativen Ansatz, um organische Bettwäsche herzustellen, die deine Haut während des Schlafes pflegt und beruhigt.

 Geschichte von AizomeEine alte japanische Kunst blüht neu auf Aizome ist die traditionelle japanische Kunst des Färbens von Stoffen mit natürlichem Indigo, einer Heilpflanze mit antibakteriellen und entzündungshemmenden Eigenschaften für die Haut. Bereits die Samurai benutzten mit Indigo gefärbte Stoffe unter ihrer Rüstung, um Wunden zu heilen, Babys wurden in ein Indigo-Tuch gewickelt und viele Menschen schliefen auf Aizome-Bettwäsche. Neben seinen hautpflegenden Eigenschaften waren diese Stoffe völlig organisch und abfallfrei. Allerdings wurde der natürliche Indigo später durch billigeres und schädliches synthetisches Indigo ersetzt, und die Kunst von Aizome starb mehr oder weniger aus. Wir möchten sie zu ihrem früheren Glanz wiederbeleben und in dein Schlafzimmer bringen.  Warum Textilien wichtig sindDein Körper reagiert auf alles, was deine Haut berührt Die Haut ist keine Barriere. Es ist das größte Organ deines Körpers. Es absorbiert eine große Menge von dem, was es berührt. Textilien minderer Qualität reizen die Haut mit Giftstoffen und verhindern eine gute Atmung.Chemikalien, die in billigen Gewebefarbstoffen wie Schwermetallen oder Chlorbenzolen verwendet werden, können durch deine Haut aufgenommen werden und sich in deinen Organen wie Nieren und Leber ansammeln und dein zentrales Nervensystem beeinflussen. Vorteil von Aizome-BettwäscheAizome beruhigt deine Haut im Schlaf Natürlicher Indigo-FarbstoffSeit Jahrhunderten bewehrtDie aktiven Bestandteile von Indigo – Tyrptanthrin und Isatin – haben positive Auswirkungen auf Entzündungen.

 Über unsWir wollen traditionelles Wissen zurückbringen. Für die Menschen und den Planeten. Wir sind eine Gruppe von Freunden aus Deutschland, Indien, Japan, Spanien und Schweden, die sich in Tokio getroffen haben.Wir haben uns in alte japanische Aizome-Textilien verliebt, dieses unglaubliche Handwerk, das gut für die Haut und umweltfreundlich ist.Mit unserer Expertise in den Bereichen Gesundheit, Textil, Design, Qualitätsmanagement und Dermatologie wollen wir diese Tradition erschwinglich und umweltfreundlich in dein Schlafzimmer bringen. Wir brauchen Dich!Wir haben sorgfältig ausgewählte Partner, die startbereit sind. Das harte Rumrennen ist erledigt, aber jetzt brauchen wir Dich. Wir benötigen Deine Bestellungen, um mindestens 10.000 Dollar zu sammeln, um unsere erste Produktion zu starten. ZeitleisteWir sind bereit für die Produktion! Februar 2017Die Frage, mit der alles begann: Warum akzeptieren wir potenziell gefährliche Chemikalien in den Textilien, in denen wir ein Drittel unseres Lebens verbringen? März 2017Wir haben eine Reise durch Japan gemacht, um herauszufinden, was die besten Textilien sind, die jemals hergestellt wurden. Mai 2017Aizome Prototypen wurden in Japan, Indien und China hergestellt. August 2017Eine Schallwellen-Technologie lieferte die besten Ergebnisse, um die Produktion nachhaltig zu machen. September 2017Wir haben Aizome Bedding als eine neue Marke gegründet, die traditionelle japanische Bio-Bettwäsche produziert. Dezember 2017Der erste Prototyp bestand die höchsten Qualitäts- und dermatologischen Tests in Japan.  Januar 2018Unser Kernteam ist auf neun angewachsen. 30. April 2018Wir starten diese Indiegogo-Kampagne, um Aizome auf die Welt zu bringen. Juni 2018 Pflücken von Indigo und Bio-Baumwolle Juli 2018Nächster Schritt nach dem Färben: weben und schneiden August 2018Aizome kommt zu dir nach Hause und du kannst deine erste Nacht in Indigo Bettwäsche verbringen. Weitere ZieleZusammen können wir mehr erreichen @ 20.000 Dollar Ein kleines ""Danke"" kommst als Überraschung in deine Sendung @ 30.000 DollarKostenloser Versand nach Japan, Korea, China, Hong Kong und Taiwan @ 60.000 DollarWir werden einen zweiten Produktdesigner einstellen @ 80.000 DollarDrei von uns können kündigen und ganztägig für Aizome Bedding arbeiten @ 100.000 DollarWir werden unsere Produktpalette erweitern – Aizome Pyjama! @ 150.000 DollarUnsere Bettwäsche wird in neuen Farben erhältlich sein. Fragen und Antworten Gesundheit Ich habe sehr empfindliche Haut, ist das für mich?Absolut. Aizome Bedding ist wie für dich gemacht. Empfindliche Haut mag keine Reizstoffe. Es gibt drei Arten von Hautirritationen, die durch Bettwäsche verursacht werden: chemische Reizung (synthetische Farbstoffe, Pestizide oder Polyester), pathogene Irritation (Bettmilben, Bakterien, Pilze) oder mechanische Reizung (Reibung durch raues Material). Aizome Bedding verwendet keine synthetischen Chemikalien, wirkt natürlich gegen Krankheitserreger, und ist in glattem Satin gewebt. Damit kannst du deine Hautprobleme zur Ruhe legen.  Ich bin allergisch gegen Staub, ist Aizome Bedding für mich?Ja, absolut. Bettmilben, deren Kot eine Hauptursache für allergische Reaktionen ist, mögen weder Indigo noch Baumwolle (sie gedeihen in synthetischem Material wie gemischte Polymertextilien). Kann es eine allergische Reaktion auf Indigo oder Baumwolle geben?Beides ist höchst unwahrscheinlich. Unser Produkt wird als „hypoallergen“ eingestuft, was bedeutet, dass es keine allergischen Reaktionen hervorrufen kann. Wir verwenden nur Indigo und unbehandelte Baumwolle, die nicht mit allergischen Reaktion in Verbindung gebracht werden. Wird diese Bettwäsche meine Hautkrankheiten lindern?Hauterkrankungen haben wie die meisten anderen keine einzige Ursache, sondern sind das Ergebnis einer komplexen Mischung von inneren und externen Faktoren. Die vernünftige Antwort ist also „nein“. Aber eine gesunde Umgebung – wie ein gesundes Bett – vermeidet weitere Belastungen und hilft deinem Körper, während er sich nachts erholt. Ich hasse Bettmilben.Wir auch. Aber Bettmilben lieben deinen Polyester-Kissenbezug. Ein Drittel des Gewichts eines fünf-Jahre-alten Kissens können tote Milben und deren Kot sein. Gut, dass Aizome Bedding natürlich antibakteriell ist. Ist das für Kinder sicher?Ja. Wir arbeiten nach internationalen Richtlinien, um unsere Produkte als unbedenklich für Kleinkinder einstufen zu lassen. Sind konventionelle Textilien wirklich so gesundheitsgefährdend, wie Ihr behauptet?Der Schwerpunkt liegt auf der Freisetzung gefährlicher Chemikalien in die Umwelt. Die Umweltprobleme, die durch die Verschmutzung seitens der Textilindustrie entstehen, sind heute weit bekannt. Stoffe, die in fertigen Textilprodukten täglich im engen Kontakt mit dem Körper sind, wurden jedoch als potentielles Risiko für die menschliche Gesundheit vernachlässigt. Die Gefahren, die von solchen Substanzen ausgehen, sind hauptsächlich Hautsensibilisierung und -reizung, aber auch Reproduktionstoxizität und nachgewiesene oder vermutete Karzinogenität. Wie fühlt sich Aizome Bedding an?Super weich. Kann ich es mit einer anderen Farbe waschen?Ja, unser Produkt ist farbecht und erfordert keine besondere Pflege. Wird die Farbe verblassen?Der Stoff wird hier in Tokio in jeder Kategorie getestet. Es ist auf dem höchsten Niveau der Farbechtheit eingestuft. Direktes Sonnenlicht über einen längeren Zeitraum kann in einigen Fällen zu leichten Farbveränderungen führen. Wird die Farbe abfärben?Nein. Dies wurde in einem Labor getestet und die Indigo-Farbe bleibt dort, wo sie ist. Kann ich Aizome Bettwäsche in die Reinigung geben?Ja. Die Farbe wird nicht beeinflusst. Hat der natürliche Farbstoff einen Geruch?Wenn die Bettwäsche nass ist, zum Beispiel wenn Sie sie aus der Waschmaschine kommt, riecht sie etwas blumig. Dies ist der Geruch von natürlichem Indigo. Was ist Aizome?Aizome ist das japanische Wort für Textilfärbung mit natürlichem Indigo. Dies geschieht durch Fermentieren der Blätter der Indigo-Pflanze. Mit jedem Eintauchen des Stoffes in die Farbe wird das Blau intensiver.   Wie habt Ihr eine solche Farbechtheit erreicht?Tradition ist unsere Grundlage: Wir verwenden nur Baumwolle, Indigo und Wasser. Wir verbessern dies mit einer neuartigen Schallwellen-Technologie. „Sonic Energie“ ist Schallwellen mit Frequenzen über 20.000 Schwingungen pro Sekunde. In Flüssigkeit verursachen diese Hochfrequenzwellen die Bildung von mikroskopischen Blasen. Kollabierende Blasen erzeugen winzige, aber starke Stoßwellen, die zu Mikrostrahlen mit hoher Geschwindigkeit führen, die auf die feste Oberfläche des Garns gerichtet sind. Diese Mikrostrahlen können zu einer Intra-Garnströmung führen, wodurch die Rate des Stoffaustauschs zwischen den Intra-Garn- und Inter-Garn-Poren erhöht wird. Das Ergebnis sind farbechte Textilien ohne Chemie. Was ist der Unterschied zwischen „Indigo“ und „natürlichem Indigo“?Natürliches Indigo ist das, was Menschen bis zur Erfindung des chemischen Indigos von Adolf von Baeyer in den 1880ern verwendeten. Chemischer Indigo wird mittlerweile fast ausschließlich verwendet. Der Name „Indigo: wird nur noch für die Farbe verwendet, nicht für die Pflanze. Soweit wir wissen, produziert kein anderes Unternehmen natürliche Indigo-Produkte in großem Umfang. Ist das Indigo dasselbe wie in meiner Jeans?Wenn deine Jeans vor 1880 hergestellt wurde, ja. Wenn nicht, ist die Wahrscheinlichkeit groß, dass Deine Jeans mit synthetischem Indigo, auch Anilin genannt, gefärbt wird, das in seiner reinen Form hochgiftig ist. Heute sind natürliche Farbstoffe fast vom Markt verschwunden. Produkt Ist Euer Produkt zertifiziert?Da wir in der sogenannten Konzeptphase sind, haben wir derzeit noch keine Zertifizierung. Wir verwenden jedoch GOTS-zertifizierte Bio-Baumwolle, produzieren in einer OEKO TEX-zertifizierten Anlage, und unsere Endprodukte werden von einem großen japanischen Textilinstitut namens QTEC auf höchste Standards geprüft. Meine Größe ist nicht verfügbar. Bitte schick uns eine E-Mail und wir helfen gern, deine Größe zu finden. Ich hätte gern eine andere Farbe.Wir werden andere Blautöne zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt produzieren.  Ist das als Geschenk passend?Absolut, wir achten sehr auf die Verpackung und Aizome Bedding ist ein tolles, langlebiges Geschenk. Von wo liefert Ihr?Wir liefern aus Yantai in China, wo die Sets in einer von uns verwalteten Anlage maßgeschneidert werden. Wird dies in Japan gemacht?Nein, wir produzieren auch in China unter kontrollierten Bedingungen. Du kannst uns aber vertrauen, dass wir in jeder Hinsicht höchste Qualität produzieren. Das Qualitätsmanagement, Überprüfungsprozess und Sicherheitsinspektionen werden alle in Japan verwaltet oder durchgeführt. Wenn ich ein anderes Produkt verwende, das OEKO-TEXT 100 ist, ist das nicht das Gleiche?Nein. Dies bedeutet, dass das Produkt gereinigt und auf 100 bekannte giftige Chemikalien überprüft wurde. Aizome Bedding war jedoch noch nie in Kontakt mit solchen Giftstoffen und damit musste auch nichts ausgewaschen werden. Das spart Tonnen Wasser und lässt dich noch ruhiger schlafen. Wie lange hält diese Bettwäsche?Möglicherweise für immer. Einige der ältesten überlebenden Stoffe sind mit natürlichem Indigo gefärbt. Auf Verschleißteile wie Reißverschlüsse, Knöpfe oder Gummibänder haben wir verzichtet. Vielleicht sind dies die letzten Laken, die du jemals brauchst. Wie wasche ich mich um meine Aizome-Bettwäsche?Um das weiche und natürliche Gefühl zu erhalten, empfehlen wir folgende Pflegehinweise: nicht bleichen, nicht im Trockner trocknen, flach zum Trocknen auslegen, bei niedriger Hitze bügeln und bei bis zu 60 ° C waschen.Muss ich auf den Import Steuer oder Gebühren bezahlen?Leider haben wir keine Kontrolle ob der Zoll eine Einfuhrsteuer erhebt oder nicht. Generell ist es bei Indiegogo und anderen Plattformen üblich, dass der Kunde die volle Verantwortung trägt sowohl Mehrwertsteuer als auch alle anderen anfallenden Gebühren in seinem zu bezahlen. Ich habe andere Kampagnen unterstützt und meine Produkte nie erhalten. Wirst du mich auch enttäuschen?Nein niemals! Du bist unsere Nummer eins. Wir haben Erfahrung in Fertigung und Qualitätsmanagement. Wir sind über dieses Projekt hinaus ehrgeizig und möchten mit Deiner Unterstützung ein Unternehmen aufbauen, das gut für Deine Gesundheit und die Umwelt ist. Du erhältst deine Aizome Bettwäsche und wir sind für Dich da.",28.0,1,"1 Campaign

As he got older, he wanted a solution that would help himself, and other friends and family who had asthma, allergies and other ailments that are directly affected by air quality.Fundamentally, the furnace controls internal air quality, but it is a technology that has had little physical efficiency improvements for half a century. Devin and the CleanAir.ai team saw this as an opportunity to design what we now call the “My ALVI” experience. This means cleaner air inside our homes, less mental stress for understanding when to change the filter, and no more guessing or mystery to the furnace. Our Team Our Responsibility Our Partners.Out of Sight. Never Out of Mind. The CleanAir.AI Team is Here to Help! Help us On Our Mission!",45.0,1,"2 Campaigns

My name is Suad Bushnaq and I'm a music composer and school teacher.
I need to raise $4,000 in order to be able to buy two much needed water coolers/ filters for the 1,880 Syrian refugee children at Al Salam (Peace) School in Reyhanli, Turkey.
These children are mostly orphans, and they have gone a long way since coming to this school. The principal and teachers at the school have left their comfortable lives in Canada and elsewhere in order to transform the lives of these traumatized children  and provide them with a haven where they can feel safe, be creative, and learn how to be caring and responsible human beings. The school is a non-profit initiative and funds are very scarce. It relies on donations and currently they are in desperate need of two water coolers/filters.

What We Need & What You Get
I need $4,000 so that the principal of the school, Miss Hazar Mahayni (whom I've known and worked with for years in Canada before she left to found this school), can arrange for the purchasing of two water coolers/filters. Last year each cooler cost $1,500. With prices going up, they will be closer to $2,000 each this year, which is why we need $4,000.

If you're not interested in a musical gift, that is OK! Just opt out of the 'perks' when you make your donation and you're good to go :)
The Impact
I have previously raised $2,000 to benefit the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation in loving memory of my mother through the sales of my music CD, and that was before music was readily available online. I am sure that with today's technology, it will be much easier for you to make a difference in these children's lives no matter where you live by a simple click.

Risks & Challenges

My goal is not very big, $4,000 can be easily collected with commitment! This is a cause that's worth it! Please donate and believe me, you will feel awesome when you know that you helped make a difference. The gift of water is the gift of life.

</div></div>","The World's First Mobile Pet CamMade for Dogs and Cats. End Pet Boredom and Separation Anxiety. See and interact with your pets remotely. Moves on carpet and hardwood floors.  






 

End Pet Boredom and Separation Anxiety
Leaving pets home alone can be stressful for pets and you. Stay connected with your fur babies no matter where you are.



Entertained While You're Away
Play an interactive game of laser chase, butterfly tease, or feather tease. You can even control which direction the laser points!

Built to Last
Made with industrial grade materials selected for toughness. The low center of gravity ensures the Pet Cam remains upright during play. Tested on over 500 sets of paws.




Treat Jam Prevention
The compartmentalized treat tray was engineered to prevent treats from jamming.


One Camera, Multi-Room View
Goodbye blindspots! Monitor your pet from room to room.The wheels have treads so the Pet Cam can move on carpet or hardwood floors.



A built-in infrared LED filter lets you see your pet even in low-light conditions.

Built-in smart sensors prevent the Pet Cam from taking a tumble down the stairs and bumping into walls or pets!
