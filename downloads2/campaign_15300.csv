<h2><strong>The Pitch</strong></h2>
<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I am Dr. Neville Ellis, human geographer and co-author of UN's IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (Oct 2018), along with my good mate and collaborator Gwenaël Velge, artist photographer based in Perth, we are looking for support to fund our photographic exhibition cum public lecture series about the Anthropocene: ""NowHere: the decisive moment.""<br/><br/>Our event is born from a growing recognition that we are living in an extraordinary moment in human and planetary time.<br/><br/>Human impacts on the Earth are profound. We are changing the climate, acidifying the oceans and erasing ecosystems and species in ways not seen in millions of years. Such is our impact on the environment that there is growing scientific consensus that humanity has pushed the earth into an entirely new geological epoch called the Anthropocene.<br/><br/>""NowHere: the decisive moment"" probes the significance of our Anthropocene moment and explores what it means for us to be human upon a human dominated planet.</p>
<p>The exhibition blends Western Australian landscapes and scientific data, taking the audience on an aesthetic and intellectual ride through the deep history of some of the oldest landscapes on earth (older than oxygen on earth...). </p>
<p>The exhibition will last 3 months and feature 3 public lectures organised around three thematics (science, art&amp;culture and politics) with reputable guest speakers engaging with why our time is so extraordinary and how we might come to tackle the challenges we face. </p>
<h2><strong>How You Can Help and What You Get</strong></h2>
<p>We need your help to fund the printing, framing and some designing of the exhibition. </p>
<p>Support our arts, culture &amp; environment project and get cards and/or archival quality prints in return! </p>
<p>In other words, receive a part of the meaningful exhibition you are about to help make publicly available!</p>
<p>·      The photographic works represent a retrospective selection of Gwen's work. Some of the pieces are already printed and framed, some are printed but not framed, while others only exist digitally at this stage. We have been quoted $6100 for the required printing and framing.</p>
<p>·      We wish to make the science digestible to the wider public (we estimate over 25,000 pub goers will see the exhibition), we will be working with OOID who specialises in graphic design for science and quoted us $1200 for the work needed. </p>
<p>·      We hope to raise an additional $500-$1000 for extra running costs (catalogues, promotion, hardware, etc.). </p>
<p>·      If we do not reach our goal, we will make do with what we have (prints and money): it is that simple. Without the ability to properly design the exhibition, it is likely to not have as strong an impact, but we are committed to making it happen no matter what. </p>
<p>·      If we go beyond our goal and once all costs have been accounted for, we will be creating a kitty that will either help us to put on a similar event elsewhere, or to support an organisation tackling climate change either locally or abroad. The decision of what to do will largely depend on how successful we are with this event and how much time and energy we can commit to a follow-up event. </p>
<h2><strong>The Necessity, the Impact</strong></h2>
<p>As the exhibition argues, we find ourselves at a planetary inflection point. It is the responsibility of the community - especially the arts community - to envision a better future and challenge the status quo. It is the responsibility of the academic community to provide the most up-to-date knowledge about the reality we inhabit in order to steer human actions in the most beneficial and ethical manner. Together, these two overlapping communities have the power to move mountains (or rocks?), not by coercion or sophistry, but by informing and inciting introspective and public reflection. <br/><br/>The scientific community is near unanimous about the dire ecological moment we find ourselves in. Yet we as a collective seem to lack the economic and political impetus to undertake meaningful action. We believe that the key to the challenges we face is to facilitate and incite strong community participation and involvement. We believe that these cultural events, mixing visual arts, engaging infographics and live forums, can meaningfully facilitate this planetary undertaking. It should happen Now, Here.</p>
<p>""NowHere"" is a genuine opportunity to reach a large number of people with a meaningful and digestible message at relatively low 'cost' to the individual supporter (i.e. high bang for your $). The cost of the venue and the audience it naturally attracts (+-2,000-2,500 people a week, possibly 30,000 people over the length of the exhibition) are free of charge thanks to the support of The National Hotel. The art, skill and knowledge of Gwenael and Neville are passionately given for free to this event. ""NowHere"" is thus likely to both present these works and data to an audience who may not have been exposed to it previously, and it also serves as a basis for community consolidating events with the public lectures we propose to put on. Science, art and politics need to work together to imagine and deliver desirable and resilient futures for all: let's make it happen with this exhibition and public lectures.  </p>
<h2><strong>The Team</strong></h2>
<p>Neville was a Contributing Author and Chapter Scientist on the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C.

Neville is passionate about science communication and working with communities to imagine climate-resilient and sustainable futures. </p>
<p>Gwen has a strong record in producing lateral thinking exhibitions, especially in the last couple years (""Homing the Unhomely"" and ""1:81""). He is also know to make stuff happen, he has a suite of uni degrees (Bachelor of Psychology, Honours Sociology, Honours International Relations, MA Peace and Dvpt Studies, and still trying to finish his PhD), has had two successful small businesses and continues to try to produce events like these which he believes help make this world a better place. </p>

<p> </p>
<p><i>Dal 14 al 19 novembre 2017, in occasione della conferenza <a href=""http://tedxbari.it/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">TEDxBari </a>sul tema del “disordine”, <a href=""http://www.spaziomurat.it/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Spazio Murat</a> ha ospitato Bazar Elettrico in Action: un’esperienza filosofica e artistica nata dalla ricerca del collettivo <a href=""http://www.action30.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Action30</a> e co-prodotta con l’associazione Cu.Bo. </i></p>
<p>Schedati e fotografati all’interno di un tunnel, muniti di guanti in lattice e coperte termiche, i partecipanti sono catapultati in una situazione surreale. Un ammasso di rovine li accoglie come un totem minaccioso e sospeso nel tempo. Alcuni sorridono incuriositi, altri non riescono a dissimulare un certo disagio.</p>
<p><strong>La catastrofe è solo il punto di partenza. Il gioco comincia qui. </strong></p>

<p> </p>
<p><i>Che cosa accadrebbe se ripetessimo l’esperienza che – a cavallo degli anni ’20-’30 del secolo scorso – facevano i surrealisti nei mercati delle pulci di Parigi? Che significato avrebbe oggi e che effetti produrrebbe su di noi?</i></p>
<p>Dopo la catastrofe della I Guerra mondiale, pressati dalla crisi economica e dal fascismo che si diffonde in Europa, i surrealisti si aggirano in trance alla ricerca di oggetti, segnali, strani indizi: tutto quello che, facendo vibrare il loro desiderio, possa indicare la strada verso l’amore e una forma di vita sociale più ricca di possibilità.</p>
<p><strong>Quando le certezze crollano, si può solo cercare tra le rovine la possibilità di un mondo diverso. Pensiamo a Cenerentola: la sua scarpina è il frammento privo di vita che parla della sua assenza, ma è anche l’oggetto carico di desiderio che rende possibile la sua ricerca.</strong></p>
<p>In una situazione storica analoga – caratterizzata dalla precarietà esistenziale e dalla crisi del legame sociale – <a href=""http://www.elettricobazar.it/category/diary/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Bazar Elettrico</i></a> è stato il tentativo di condividere un “momento surrealista” nella routine della vita quotidiana: per evocare la magia degli oggetti e tracciare, attraverso un processo di creazione collettiva, la mappa degli incontri possibili.</p>
<p>Persone di tutte le età ed estrazioni – da sole, in coppia oppure in piccoli gruppi – sono partite dalla catastrofe per rimettersi subito in gioco.</p>
<p>Non solo hanno giocato i bambini, ma tutti, come bambini, hanno smontato e rimontato la realtà, inventando connessioni sempre nuove, e producendo il fragile miracolo di un’espressione al tempo stesso soggettiva e collettiva del desiderio.</p>

<p>Questo slogan ha accompagnato la preparazione di Bazar elettrico in Action.</p>
<p>Ce lo siamo detti, ce lo siamo ripetuti ogni volta che ci siamo incontrati con gli studenti del liceo artistico e con i migranti ospiti dello Sprar di Bari.</p>
<p>Poi l’evento è arrivato. Ed eravamo pronti. Pronti a mettere il tempo fuori di sesto, a creare la lieve distorsione di un altrove. Pronti a condividere una piccola estasi nella vita quotidiana.</p>
<p>Pronti a partire da una catastrofe immaginaria, per metterci subito, concretamente, in viaggio verso il pianeta Possibile. Pronti anche ad affrontare le catastrofi reali, come quando una bomba d’acqua si è abbattuta sulla città inondando lo spazio in cui si svolgeva l’evento. </p>
<p>Pronti a navigare, a farci mosaico e a salvarci. Insieme.</p>
<p>Viviamo in un mondo che, invece di annunciare il sol dell’avvenire, è capace solo di vendere la notte dell’avvenire.</p>
<p>Un film senza la parola fine, nel quale ogni catastrofe diventa l’occasione per annunciare la successiva, con tutto il corollario di paure, di chiusure identitarie, di pericolose promesse di un mondo ridotto a “casa nostra”.</p>

<p>No, un altro presente è possibile! Ecco cosa ha detto l’esperienza di <i>Bazar elettrico</i> e per questo vogliamo andare avanti. </p>
<p>Il processo è l’evento, e cioè: se il processo ha preceduto l’evento, allora vuol dire che potrà anche scavalcarlo.</p>
<p><strong>Con il vostro aiuto vorremmo provare a continuare il viaggio: a ricostruire il pianeta Possibile attraverso un libro nel quale, attraverso l’eterogeneità dei materiali, delle forme e dei linguaggi, pulsino ancora altri tempi e altri luoghi.</strong></p>

<p>Per continuare a smontare e rimontare la realtà camminando come funamboli tra l’esperienza storica dei surrealisti e i problemi del presente.</p>
<p>Per incontrarci ancora e giocare insieme come bambini. Per continuare a riflettere sulle cose che facciamo mentre le stiamo facendo.</p>
<p><strong>E alla fine, quando il libro sarà pubblicato, per fare finalmente la festa cui fummo costretti a rinunciare, a causa dell’allagamento dello spazio che avevamo trasformato in una straordinaria macchina desiderante.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>Un nuovo miracolo ci attende. Fragile e potente come i nostri desideri. Come un volo di farfalle poggiate sul muro delle nostre vite.</strong></p>

<h3 style=""color:#cc0000;""><strong>4. La storia del progetto: per chi volesse approfondire</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><i>La ricerca è un viaggio senza capo né coda. Comincia sempre “nel mezzo” e così procede. Ogni ricerca è un pezzo di strada all’interno di una più ampia ed eterogenea rete di percorsi che si sovrappongono, s’intersecano, si diramano, fuggendo in tutte le direzioni.</i></p>
<p>L’idea di Bazar Elettrico in Action – l’happening/installazione che ha avuto luogo a Bari dal 14 al 19 novembre 2017 – nasce dalla ricerca di Action30, culminata nel volume <a href=""http://www.fumettologica.it/2017/08/bazar-elettrico-action30-divittorio-palumbo-intervista/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Bazar elettrico.

<p> </p>
<p>Tutto questo ha un immediato risvolto “politico”, nel senso tali macchine di ricerca invitano a considerare in modo ecosistemico anche le forme di vita umane e sociali. Basti pensare che Warburg, lo studioso del Rinascimento che ha rivoluzionato l’approccio alla storia dell’arte, concepiva la cultura come una sorta di <i>“cinema” della migrazione geografica e storica delle immagini.</i> Non c’è cultura senza migrazioni, e le migrazioni sono un intensificatore di eterogeneità che vivifica in permanenza le culture.</p>
<p>Viviamo in un mondo in cui l’eterogeneo trionfa, come dimostra la banale esperienza di navigare sul web. Tuttavia, attraverso i flussi del <i>mainstream</i> – globalizzazione, gentrificazione, trasformazione della realtà in <i>reality</i> – l’eterogeneo è costantemente frullato e trasformato in omogeneo. Le “tendenze principali” sono implacabili distruttrici di ecosistemi eterogenei: dalla forma di vita di una tribù amazzonica o di un quartiere popolare, alle forme di pensiero critico e creativo. Così il terreno s’inaridisce e la cultura deperisce. Perciò bisogna provare a far girare il frullatore al contrario; a ottenere dall’omogeneo l’eterogeneo; a smontare e rimontare incessantemente i flussi del <i>mainstream</i>.</p>
<p><strong>Fare cultura, oggi, significa in primo luogo praticare degli <i>abicì culturali:</i> per costruire nuove “mappe sinaptiche”; per inventare altre connessioni con noi stessi, con gli altri, con la realtà, con il mondo.</strong></p>
<p>Il secondo affluente è la creazione di nuovi format per la “condivisione della cultura”.</p>
<p>In questi anni, il collettivo Action30 ha sperimentato dei <a href=""http://www.uzak.it/component/content/article/128-lo-stato-delle-cose/960-appunti-sparsi-per-un-progetto-postmediale-note-su-action30.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">format “ibridi”</a> finalizzati, non a produrre consenso, ma a condividere con la gente percorsi analitici, problemi, domande: <i>saggi-grafici, performance-dibattito, saggi-spettacolo.</i></p>
<p>A un certo punto questi tentativi non sono parsi soddisfacenti: non tanto sul piano delle proposte culturali, quanto su quello della “partecipazione” della gente ai percorsi proposti. La cultura non è forse “lavoro” condiviso? Si può condividere cultura senza l’effettiva partecipazione degli “altri”?</p>
<p>Nonostante le migliori intenzione, il libro, la performance e lo spettacolo sono dispositivi “chiusi”: da un lato ci sono gli autori e gli attori, dall’altro i lettori e gli spettatori.</p>
<p><strong>Per la prima volta, con <i>Bazar elettrico in Action</i>, il collettivo ha fatto esplodere la “scena”: </strong>dapprima condividendo il progetto con gli studenti del liceo artistico “Pascali-De Nittis” e con gli ospiti minori e adulti dello Sprar di Bari; in seguito facendo partecipare centinaia di persone a un gioco surrealista con gli oggetti che era anche, e al tempo stesso, un’esperienza ecosistemica sulla precarietà esistenziale e sulla crisi del legame sociale. </p>

L’Happening/installazione
 
Dal 14 al 19 novembre 2017, in occasione della conferenza TEDxBari sul tema del “disordine”, Spazio Murat ha ospitato Bazar Elettrico in Action: un’esperienza filosofica e artistica nata dalla ricerca del collettivo Action30 e co-prodotta con l’associazione Cu.Bo. 
Schedati e fotografati all’interno di un tunnel, muniti di guanti in lattice e coperte termiche, i partecipanti sono catapultati in una situazione surreale. Un ammasso di rovine li accoglie come un totem minaccioso e sospeso nel tempo. Alcuni sorridono incuriositi, altri non riescono a dissimulare un certo disagio.
La catastrofe è solo il punto di partenza. Il gioco comincia qui. 
 

Ph.: Giuseppe Santoro
 
Oltre 500 persone hanno partecipato all’esperienza realizzata a Bari dal collettivo Action30, in collaborazione con gli studenti del liceo artistico “Pascali-De Nittis” e gli ospiti minori e adulti del Progetto Sprar (Sistema protezione richiedenti asilo e rifugiati) di Bari.
 

 

Un articolo sull'esperienza ""B.E. in action"", pubblicato sul sito della UAL (University of the Arts London): ""Bazar Elettrico – electrifying the present to imagine new futures""

 
 
 
2. L’esperimento e il gioco
 
Che cosa accadrebbe se ripetessimo l’esperienza che – a cavallo degli anni ’20-’30 del secolo scorso – facevano i surrealisti nei mercati delle pulci di Parigi? Che significato avrebbe oggi e che effetti produrrebbe su di noi?
Dopo la catastrofe della I Guerra mondiale, pressati dalla crisi economica e dal fascismo che si diffonde in Europa, i surrealisti si aggirano in trance alla ricerca di oggetti, segnali, strani indizi: tutto quello che, facendo vibrare il loro desiderio, possa indicare la strada verso l’amore e una forma di vita sociale più ricca di possibilità.
Quando le certezze crollano, si può solo cercare tra le rovine la possibilità di un mondo diverso. Pensiamo a Cenerentola: la sua scarpina è il frammento privo di vita che parla della sua assenza, ma è anche l’oggetto carico di desiderio che rende possibile la sua ricerca.
In una situazione storica analoga – caratterizzata dalla precarietà esistenziale e dalla crisi del legame sociale – Bazar Elettrico è stato il tentativo di condividere un “momento surrealista” nella routine della vita quotidiana: per evocare la magia degli oggetti e tracciare, attraverso un processo di creazione collettiva, la mappa degli incontri possibili.
Persone di tutte le età ed estrazioni – da sole, in coppia oppure in piccoli gruppi – sono partite dalla catastrofe per rimettersi subito in gioco.
Non solo hanno giocato i bambini, ma tutti, come bambini, hanno smontato e rimontato la realtà, inventando connessioni sempre nuove, e producendo il fragile miracolo di un’espressione al tempo stesso soggettiva e collettiva del desiderio.

Sotto la guida degli studenti del liceo artistico, i partecipanti si sono emozionati guardando i giganteschi video di un ragazzo e una ragazza che si sarebbero persi o non si sarebbero mai incontrati.
 

Ph.: Giuseppe Santoro
 
Interagendo con questi video, si sono fatti toccare dalle loro vite, hanno cominciato a prendersene cura e sono andati così alla ricerca degli oggetti che avrebbero potuto farli incontrare.

Fotografati e stampati in diretta, gli oggetti selezionati hanno pian piano elettrizzato il bazar, componendo un vibrante ed eterogeneo montaggio di pensieri, ricordi, emozioni, storie reali o immaginate. Un Crazy Wall – simile a quelli su cui i detective svolgono le loro indagini – che però non è servito a scoprire il colpevole di un delitto, ma a inventare i percorsi possibili attraverso cui i due ragazzi avrebbero potuto incontrarsi.

Nei giorni dell’evento, lo Spazio Murat si è trasformato in una macchina desiderante: un formidabile intensificatore di “possibili”. Le centinaia di fogli, con le foto e i pensieri dei partecipanti, poggiati come farfalle sul muro dei desideri, sono state la concreta testimonianza, al tempo stesso fragile e carica di potenza, che un mondo diverso è possibile.
 

Ph.: Arnaldo Di Vittorio
 
 
3. Un libro per continuare a incontrarsi e a giocare: la gaia scienza delle rovine.
 
L’evento ci ha lasciato un piccolo tesoro che ora, con il vostro aiuto, vorremmo trasformare in un libro: per custodire il fragile miracolo; per rivitalizzarlo con i partener del progetto; per condividerlo con chi non ha avuto l’occasione di partecipare all’esperienza. 

Questo slogan ha accompagnato la preparazione di Bazar elettrico in Action.
Ce lo siamo detti, ce lo siamo ripetuti ogni volta che ci siamo incontrati con gli studenti del liceo artistico e con i migranti ospiti dello Sprar di Bari.
Poi l’evento è arrivato. Ed eravamo pronti. Pronti a mettere il tempo fuori di sesto, a creare la lieve distorsione di un altrove. Pronti a condividere una piccola estasi nella vita quotidiana.
Pronti a partire da una catastrofe immaginaria, per metterci subito, concretamente, in viaggio verso il pianeta Possibile. Pronti anche ad affrontare le catastrofi reali, come quando una bomba d’acqua si è abbattuta sulla città inondando lo spazio in cui si svolgeva l’evento. 
Pronti a navigare, a farci mosaico e a salvarci. Insieme.
Viviamo in un mondo che, invece di annunciare il sol dell’avvenire, è capace solo di vendere la notte dell’avvenire.
Un film senza la parola fine, nel quale ogni catastrofe diventa l’occasione per annunciare la successiva, con tutto il corollario di paure, di chiusure identitarie, di pericolose promesse di un mondo ridotto a “casa nostra”.
 

 
No, un altro presente è possibile! Ecco cosa ha detto l’esperienza di Bazar elettrico e per questo vogliamo andare avanti. 
Il processo è l’evento, e cioè: se il processo ha preceduto l’evento, allora vuol dire che potrà anche scavalcarlo.
Con il vostro aiuto vorremmo provare a continuare il viaggio: a ricostruire il pianeta Possibile attraverso un libro nel quale, attraverso l’eterogeneità dei materiali, delle forme e dei linguaggi, pulsino ancora altri tempi e altri luoghi.

Per continuare a smontare e rimontare la realtà camminando come funamboli tra l’esperienza storica dei surrealisti e i problemi del presente.
Per incontrarci ancora e giocare insieme come bambini. Per continuare a riflettere sulle cose che facciamo mentre le stiamo facendo.
E alla fine, quando il libro sarà pubblicato, per fare finalmente la festa cui fummo costretti a rinunciare, a causa dell’allagamento dello spazio che avevamo trasformato in una straordinaria macchina desiderante.  
Un nuovo miracolo ci attende. Fragile e potente come i nostri desideri. Come un volo di farfalle poggiate sul muro delle nostre vite.
 
 
4. La storia del progetto: per chi volesse approfondire
 
La ricerca è un viaggio senza capo né coda. Comincia sempre “nel mezzo” e così procede. Ogni ricerca è un pezzo di strada all’interno di una più ampia ed eterogenea rete di percorsi che si sovrappongono, s’intersecano, si diramano, fuggendo in tutte le direzioni.
L’idea di Bazar Elettrico in Action – l’happening/installazione che ha avuto luogo a Bari dal 14 al 19 novembre 2017 – nasce dalla ricerca di Action30, culminata nel volume Bazar elettrico. Bataille, Warburg, Benjamin at Work (2017), con cui il collettivo ha inaugurato per le edizioni Lavieri una collana dedicata al “saggio grafico”.
 

Ph.: Arnaldo Di Vittorio
 
Action30 è un gruppo di ricercatori e artisti, attivo in Italia e all’estero da oltre dieci anni, che indaga sulle “nuove forme” di razzismo e fascismo attraverso l’analogia con gli anni ’30 del secolo scorso, e sperimenta nuove forme ibride di trasmissione e condivisione della cultura.
Il collettivo cerca di collegare le sue pratiche con una riflessione che poi si traduce in nuove sperimentazioni e così di seguito.
Il filo conduttore di tali sperimentazioni è il tentativo di condividere cultura, sviluppando una tensione tra gli archivi culturali e l’attualità, e usando la finzione o il gioco come funambolica passerella attraverso cui “sincronizzare” il passato con i problemi del presente. 
La scommessa del collettivo è, in fondo, quella di riuscire a tenere insieme l’autonomia dei percorsi di ricerca e l’urgente desiderio di condividerli con la gente. 
L’esperienza realizzata per la prima volta a Bari è stata il punto in cui due corsi d’acqua sono confluiti l’uno nell’altro formando un’unica corrente.
Il primo affluente è una ricerca di carattere “ecosistemico”.
Sappiamo che la diversità è la condizione che presiede allo sviluppo della vita naturale, ma spesso dimentichiamo che questo vale anche per la cultura: per lo sviluppo del pensiero, della creatività, delle forme di vita umane e sociali.
Di qui l’interesse del collettivo per alcune macchine di ricerca, riscoperte nell’archivio culturale, e che potrebbero essere “remixate” per metterle in sintonia con il presente. Le macchine di Bataille, Warburg e Banjamin sono banchi di montaggio ecosistemici: sospese le gerarchie e abbattuti gli steccati disciplinari, il tavolo da lavoro si riempie di una molteplicità di materiali eterogenei e una serie di montaggi inediti diventa possibile. Sono sistemi di ricerca basati sull’eterogeneità e che sprigionano quell’energia “differenziale” necessaria perché una cultura sia viva, vitale. Bazar elettrici che accendono il pensiero e la creatività.
 

 
Tutto questo ha un immediato risvolto “politico”, nel senso tali macchine di ricerca invitano a considerare in modo ecosistemico anche le forme di vita umane e sociali. Basti pensare che Warburg, lo studioso del Rinascimento che ha rivoluzionato l’approccio alla storia dell’arte, concepiva la cultura come una sorta di “cinema” della migrazione geografica e storica delle immagini.

Così il terreno s’inaridisce e la cultura deperisce. Perciò bisogna provare a far girare il frullatore al contrario; a ottenere dall’omogeneo l’eterogeneo; a smontare e rimontare incessantemente i flussi del mainstream.

Il secondo affluente è la creazione di nuovi format per la “condivisione della cultura”.
In questi anni, il collettivo Action30 ha sperimentato dei format “ibridi” finalizzati, non a produrre consenso, ma a condividere con la gente percorsi analitici, problemi, domande: saggi-grafici, performance-dibattito, saggi-spettacolo.

<p>We, ‘GarageArt’, are an independent Cultural Space and art café in Irbid, Jordan, that is run by a network of artists and art activists of the association ‘MedeArts’  in Irbid. We have a passion for arts and culture, and believe in the values of dialogue, acceptance and respect. ‘GarageArt’, is open to everyone at all times and provides its members and the local community with a Safe Space to gather, exchange and create. As a result of Covid-19 and other obstacles faced, we were not able to generate enough money to cover our rent and are now at risk of losing our space. Therefore, we have decided to launch this campaign so that with your support, we will be able to continue our work and save this space for our community.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1628254142/tgiaahm7yvbzousvojpl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>FYI: As a team member of GarageArt I am launching this campaign in representation as an individual, since it is almost impossible for Nonprofits based in Jordan to do so. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Where your money goes: </strong></h3>
<p>To keep our space open, we would mainly need help to cover the rent as we would be able to cover the minor expenses of running costs and staff compensations through the income we were and are still able to generate with our café and the activities we host. Rents in Jordan are often paid for 6 months in advance, which in our case amounts to 3000 EUR (2986.10 exactly). Covering this amount would enable us to bridge the current difficult times until we are able to generate sufficient income again. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1628254291/kbz4xq1vf1ccedkjpubi.jpg"" src=""""/></p> <h3><strong>Why GarageArt? </strong></h3>
<p>Establishing and maintaining ‘GarageArt’ for young people and artists from our communities was and is our heartfelt desire, as many of these young people suffer from non-acceptance in their own society with no place to go.</p>
<p>To address that, we have been working hard over the past years to operate a space where local youth and local artists can do what they love, feel empowered, create and connect with likeminded people. Growing up as artists in Irbid ourselves and having faced many obstacles, we know how important it is to have a space like this. To remain independent, we have set-up a self-sustaining economic system, by which we generate income through our café space and the different cultural events we host. However, Covid-19 and a recent smear campaign against us by social media and individuals made it impossible to generate sufficient means to keep our doors open. </p>
<p>Irbid is a rather conservative place in which music, theatre and other forms of arts may already be considered morally unacceptable. In this particular case, a regular concert attended by women and men together was already enough to spark outrage amongst some individuals, who actively went against us. We were asked to cancel events, faced threats that our space would be closed and heard from customers that they were prevented by their families from coming. Having experienced that, for us it is now more important than ever to fight these tendencies by promoting openness and tolerance and maintaining a space in which young people can feel safe and accepted, exchange and be involved in arts and culture. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What we have achieved over the past two years</strong></h3>
<p>‘GarageArt’ is a vibrant place hosting many different community projects. Next to having our doors open for everyone to meet we are offering all kinds of art workshops and host film screenings, theatre and storytelling performances, as well as music performances of various genres. In addition to that, we organize various discussions close to the heart of our Youth like questions about ‘identity’ and facilitate meetings with local decision makers to promote the art and cultural scene in our city and ensure that the voices of our young artists and youth are heard. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1628254333/cggu1w2y3bpmoix8o653.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Despite Covid-19 and while maintaining strict safety measures, we were able to host more than 100 activities in our space over the past 12 months. Some of the highlights were:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">26/08/2020: Team Painting Event for youth from Jordan Valley and Irbid</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">29-30/09/2020: Songwriting Workshop wit Ahmed Farah</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">26-27/10/2020: Sudanese Film Days supported by Goethe Institute Amman</li>

<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">12-14/06/2021: Pottery and Mosaic Workshops</li>
</ul> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Given that we are working in the field of arts and culture in a very conservative community there is always the challenge of building and maintaining trust. Since the start of GarageArt we have involved our local community and worked closely together as for many, the kind of cultural activities we offer is new.  Throughout the two years we managed to build trust and create a Safe Space frequently visited and loved by many young people and families from Irbid as well as artists and cultural actors from Jordan and beyond. Despite that, there are still individuals in our community who actively work against us. The recent smear campaign with false accusations and defamations which was shared widely on social media put our space at risk. At the same time, the support and positive affirmations we received from our networks and friends gave us courage and showed us how immensely important it is not to give up. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1628254404/fcm0qtqycsylfucepuqd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>However, given the economically difficult situation we are already facing as a result of Covid-19, it is currently not possible for us to cover our rent. Even though we are aware that the Covid-19 related restrictions will continue in one way or the other during the upcoming months, we are certain that once we can overcome the hard times we are currently facing, we will be able to re-establish our self-sustainability, generate enough money through our Café and events and be able to continue independently. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Every amount is helpful! If you can’t donate yourself it would be great if you could share this call with people you know. However, please share it only privately and don’t publish it online as the situation we are currently facing is very sensitive given the smear campaign against us. </p>
<p>Thank you so much for standing with us and for supporting youth and the artist community in Irbid!</p>

</div></div>","We, ‘GarageArt’, are an independent Cultural Space and art café in Irbid, Jordan, that is run by a network of artists and art activists of the association ‘MedeArts’  in Irbid. We have a passion for arts and culture, and believe in the values of dialogue, acceptance and respect. ‘GarageArt’, is open to everyone at all times and provides its members and the local community with a Safe Space to gather, exchange and create. As a result of Covid-19 and other obstacles faced, we were not able to generate enough money to cover our rent and are now at risk of losing our space. Therefore, we have decided to launch this campaign so that with your support, we will be able to continue our work and save this space for our community.

FYI: As a team member of GarageArt I am launching this campaign in representation as an individual, since it is almost impossible for Nonprofits based in Jordan to do so. 
 
Where your money goes: 
To keep our space open, we would mainly need help to cover the rent as we would be able to cover the minor expenses of running costs and staff compensations through the income we were and are still able to generate with our café and the activities we host. Rents in Jordan are often paid for 6 months in advance, which in our case amounts to 3000 EUR (2986.10 exactly). Covering this amount would enable us to bridge the current difficult times until we are able to generate sufficient income again. 
 Why GarageArt? 
Establishing and maintaining ‘GarageArt’ for young people and artists from our communities was and is our heartfelt desire, as many of these young people suffer from non-acceptance in their own society with no place to go.
To address that, we have been working hard over the past years to operate a space where local youth and local artists can do what they love, feel empowered, create and connect with likeminded people. Growing up as artists in Irbid ourselves and having faced many obstacles, we know how important it is to have a space like this. To remain independent, we have set-up a self-sustaining economic system, by which we generate income through our café space and the different cultural events we host. However, Covid-19 and a recent smear campaign against us by social media and individuals made it impossible to generate sufficient means to keep our doors open. 
Irbid is a rather conservative place in which music, theatre and other forms of arts may already be considered morally unacceptable. In this particular case, a regular concert attended by women and men together was already enough to spark outrage amongst some individuals, who actively went against us. We were asked to cancel events, faced threats that our space would be closed and heard from customers that they were prevented by their families from coming. Having experienced that, for us it is now more important than ever to fight these tendencies by promoting openness and tolerance and maintaining a space in which young people can feel safe and accepted, exchange and be involved in arts and culture. 
 
What we have achieved over the past two years
‘GarageArt’ is a vibrant place hosting many different community projects. Next to having our doors open for everyone to meet we are offering all kinds of art workshops and host film screenings, theatre and storytelling performances, as well as music performances of various genres. In addition to that, we organize various discussions close to the heart of our Youth like questions about ‘identity’ and facilitate meetings with local decision makers to promote the art and cultural scene in our city and ensure that the voices of our young artists and youth are heard. 

Despite Covid-19 and while maintaining strict safety measures, we were able to host more than 100 activities in our space over the past 12 months. Some of the highlights were:

26/08/2020: Team Painting Event for youth from Jordan Valley and Irbid
29-30/09/2020: Songwriting Workshop wit Ahmed Farah
26-27/10/2020: Sudanese Film Days supported by Goethe Institute Amman
31/10/2020: ‘Tea Talk’ about Mental Health
12/12/2020: All-Women Talk with Feminist Collective ‘Takatoat’
05-06/01/2021: Karama Human Rights Film Festival 11 - Irbid Outreach
24/01/2021: Theatre Play ‘A Lockdown-Night Dream’ directed by Hakim Harb
16/02/2021: Melosika Band Performance and Discussion
27/02/2021: Collective Art Workshop and Gallery
08/03/2021: International Women’s Day with Artists Heba Nabulsi
10-11/04/2021: Mask Making Workshop with Artists Yasmeen Kurdi
12-14/06/2021: Pottery and Mosaic Workshops
 Risks & Challenges
Given that we are working in the field of arts and culture in a very conservative community there is always the challenge of building and maintaining trust. Since the start of GarageArt we have involved our local community and worked closely together as for many, the kind of cultural activities we offer is new.  Throughout the two years we managed to build trust and create a Safe Space frequently visited and loved by many young people and families from Irbid as well as artists and cultural actors from Jordan and beyond. Despite that, there are still individuals in our community who actively work against us. The recent smear campaign with false accusations and defamations which was shared widely on social media put our space at risk. At the same time, the support and positive affirmations we received from our networks and friends gave us courage and showed us how immensely important it is not to give up. 

However, given the economically difficult situation we are already facing as a result of Covid-19, it is currently not possible for us to cover our rent. Even though we are aware that the Covid-19 related restrictions will continue in one way or the other during the upcoming months, we are certain that once we can overcome the hard times we are currently facing, we will be able to re-establish our self-sustainability, generate enough money through our Café and events and be able to continue independently. 
 
Other Ways You Can Help
Every amount is helpful! If you can’t donate yourself it would be great if you could share this call with people you know. However, please share it only privately and don’t publish it online as the situation we are currently facing is very sensitive given the smear campaign against us. 
Thank you so much for standing with us and for supporting youth and the artist community in Irbid!",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>The HomeComputerMuseum houses an unique collections of hundreds of computers and even more stories about these computers. Stories you can't find on the internet (yet), stories told by directors, managers, employees and users of all these computers. <strong>Stories we like to share to the world and we've choosen the live stream to do so. Despite us having the material for it and that's where IndieGoGo came along!</strong></p>
<p>We've set a few goals.</p>
<ul>
<li>When we reach €125: We'll simply stream using our smartphone. No chat and quality is, well, ok-ish? </li>
<li>When we reach the goal of €350 we'll rent a professional camera and cameraman filming us in Full HD-resolution. Also a team of our volunteers will be on the chat to answer the questions (and if you're lucky, the answer will be on video)</li>
<li>When we reach €1000, we're going to invest in better light and better atmosphere in the museum. The video will be even better.</li>
<li>For €2500, we'll buy our own streaming gear and make more videos of us repairing or testing (old) computers.</li>
<li>For €5000, we'll do the same as for the €2500, but this gives us major support to continue the museum and improve it even more!</li>
<li>For €12500, we'll do everything above and create an app to visit the museum 24x7. It will be for Android and Apple and will give all the background information.</li>
<li>Ultimate goal: €25000. This will give us a huge financial boost to improve the whole museum and experience.  We will create a mobile app for Apple and Android with the whole tour integrated, so you can visit 24x7! Every penny left will be invested in improving the museum to make sure we will become the biggest and most amazing one (I think we already are, but hey... ;-) )</li>
</ul>
<h3>What You Get aka Perks</h3>
<p>Next to the live streaming tour, <u>which is included in all perks</u>, we will offer a few items more. We have a neat T-shirt</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561932630/wc0xygbhaquyzku7mxas.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Or an awesome sticker that they've promised will keep it's color for at least 2 years (size is a little over a 3,5"" disk).</p>

<p>Since we hope that we have a lot of viewers of this tour, we like to offer companies to put their logo in the stream and possibly future streams/videos. This way, as a company, you can reach the audience quickly and you're supporting a real museum. Seems like a win-win to me :)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>For even the smallest amount, you'll get to see the unique museum and hear the amazing stories we have, from the comfort of your own home (or office). You don't need to travel to Helmond (near Eindhoven) and find a place to sleep, you can just watch.</p>
<p>Of course you can read a lot of information on the Internet, but to actually see it and ask live questions about it, is so much better. </p>
<p>I'm not asking to save the museum or help us open a museum. It's already there! We offer you to get the full tour as you are in the actual museum and this time, you can eat and drink whatever you like. </p>
<p>Yes, if we have more money, the money will flow into the further existence of the museum. We need quite some improvements and we like to be able to invest.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is not a ""we can't make it if we don't have the funds""-campaign. Even if we don't make the ultimate goal, we still continue to exist as a museum. If we don't make the smallest goal of €125, well, there won't be a livestream and you should actually get up and come over to Helmond to visit the museum in person. However, all the money received from this campaign will be put to good use in the museum. We won't buy a bunch of beer and get drunk, but it will be invested.</p>
<ul>
<li>The minimum is €125, but we can really show it in the best possible way at the €1000-mark.</li>
<li>The €2500 gives us our own gear (instead of renting it), meaning we can continue making videos in a professional way.</li>
<li>Every euro above €2500 will be invested in the museum. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Maybe you can't contribute with money, but still want to help. </p>
<ul>
<li>Spread the word using the share buttons! </li>
<li>Ask your friend(s) to chip in and watch together, it'll be fun! </li>
<li>If you're in the general area of Eindhoven, feel free to actually visit the museum. It is a great trip down memory lane.</li>

<h3>Venus Venue - et event for mangfoldighed i Nordjylland.</h3>
<p>Venus Venue er et initiativ, som er taget af 5 nordjyske kvinder - som alle har det til fælles, at vi ønsker et større fokus på kropspositivisme, LGBT+-miljøer og ligestilling i Nordjylland. </p>
<p>Ved at iværksætte et gratis event, hvor der sættes fokus på emner som tykfobi, kønsnormer, diversitet, selvkærlighed og meget mere - gennem workshops, debat, oplæg og musik - ønsker vi at sætte et positivt aftryk i Nordjylland.</p>
<p>Vi synes, at alle har ret til at være stolte over hvem de er, hvordan de ser ud og hvordan de ønsker at udtrykke sig. Vi vil gerne være med til at give mere albuerum til mangfoldigheden og sætte samtaler i gang om diversitet og selvkærlighed. </p>
<p>2021 er det første år, hvor eventet skal afholdes. Eventet planlægges at blive afholdt en gang om året fremover. I år finder det sted i HUSET, Aalborg - lørdag d. 23. oktober.</p>

• Total expenses, without the rent of a vehicle, are approximately 80-100 thousand kuna, or 12-15 thousand euro (14 – 18 thousand US dollars), and are mostly  related to absolutely necessary technical props.

<p>Living in New Orleans I have met such wonderful and open minded people. I have also met a lot of young men and women you are looking for a place to explore and learn about alternative spirituality but do not feel they can either where they live or in overly public places. There are also an abundant of well-informed spiritual teachers, authors, and readers who are looking to share that information and yet have a hard time finding locations that can accommodate. <br/><br/>The Witch's Library plans to be an open space where anyone can come, choose from a variety of spiritually informative books, and can sit, read, drink coffee, and chat with other like-minded individuals.

<h3>Studio Current is an artist run, culture creating, subterranean laboratory in the heart of Seattle's Capitol Hill arts district. Our mission is to enliven creative practice for everybody.</h3>
<p>SC is a low cost performance venue, a multidisciplinary rehearsal space, and a champion of experimental art. We hosts classes, workshops, and a 9 month long artist residency program with about 10- 15 artists each season.</p>
<ul>
<li>Artistic Director Katherine Cohen and our Managing Artist Directors - the MAD team  -Angelina Baldoz, Markeith Wiley, Laura Aschoff, and Elby Brosch are working artists that care about creative process, practice, and continuing to develop SC as a community resource. </li>
<li>This fundraising is vital to sustaining SC through the 2017/18 season.</li>
<li>We can't do it without your help! We are a grassroots organization running on magic but as it turns out we also need money to keep up the good work. </li>
<li>Our major goals include<br/>- Sustaining our residency program<br/>- Remaining an affordable venue in the heart of the Capitol Hill Arts District <br/>- Keeping Studio Current an inclusive safe space for queers, POC's and other nonconformists and experimenters.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>And now it's time for the break down:</p>
<p>We hope to raise the $16000 needed to sustain us through the remainder of our 2017/2018 season. This is not all it takes to run this space, but your financial support is an integral part of the process! We can't do it without you! We have a few FunKy perks! Studio Current loves you! These funds go directly toward our rent - it's the majority of our overhead - and other costs like insurance, utilities, supplies like light bulbs, paint brushes, bandaids, cleaners, and other various administrative fees. </p>

<p>Your help really does make all the difference. It bridges the gap between the passion, time, and energy we have about maintaining SC and all of the expenses involved in actually doing so. </p>
<ul>
<li>What is the trajectory of an artist? Experimentation, connection, failures, successes - it's very different for all of us. It's so crucial that artists have time, space, and support to discover and work their process so that they can fully find what it is they do without always having to fit themselves or their work in a box. We are committed to providing this opportunity.</li>
<li>Our last Indiegogo fundraiser you helped us raise $10,000 - wow! Thank you! You helped sustain Season II of our Artist residency program and helped us install a fancy new sprung dance floor. Season III is underway with 10 AIRs and 5 Directors + many renters enjoying the renovated studio space, our multipurpose room, the common area and kitchen - all because of the support we received to help us get settled in our new home.</li>

The challenge led us to a new space, a new way of organizing, and the awareness that it takes a caring community to sustain this healthy ecosystem of ours - and it's happening! With your help we're continuing to amplify the same idea that creative practice and culture can and should be sustained and supported on every level and in every way possible. SC has made this our mission for 14 years, and much of the performance art and dance Seattle enjoys has been affected by it or directly supported and influenced by it.</li>

Don’t let these truly remarkable men and women be forgotten.On behalf of the team here, I would like to thank you for your generosity and the important role you have played in preserving history.Group of air and ground crew standing on a Halifax, courtesy of Dennis Raettig",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>The Vision</h2>
<p>The vision for the Culture Advocate Network is to build resilient communities founded in acceptance and love of their culture ambassadors. How? First, we build a growing social network of the culture ambassadors (i.e. refugees) currently living in our communities. Once the benefits of cultural diversity are realized, we hope for CAN to be an integral part of the resettlement process globally. Our goal is for the Culture Advocate Network to be utilized by government, non-governmental, and local organizations/agencies around the world in the decades to come as we face this era of human re-distribution.</p>
<h2>The Inspiration</h2>
<p>This journey started when I first stepped foot in South Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana in 2013 - home to the first climate migrants of the U.S. In the time I spent there for (my thesis), I asked myself: </p>
<p>How do you get a communities of people to move from a place they have called home for generations? What can be done to preserve the cultures of those that are forcibly displaced? How can we ensure peaceful and sustainable migrations? What will it take for us to see migration as a viable form of adaptation to climate impacts, especially when there is no other option?</p>
<p>These questions led me to create <a href=""http://slwdc.org/programs/vanishing-points/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Vanishing Points (TM)</a> along side Jonathan Foret, the Executive Director of a local non-profit called the South Louisiana Wetlands Discovery Center. This website serves as an archive for culturally significant locations in South Louisiana.  Not only does it capture memories and their culture, Vanishing Points (TM) also serves an educational platform for the new communities these residents will move into.</p>
<p>After handing Vanishing Points (TM) over to the SLWDC, I thought - there has to be value in doing this on a global scale. </p>
<p><strong>Your contribution to the start-up costs The Culture Advocate Network will bring years of learning and research to fruition. This is a pioneering social enterprise that will address a global issue that affects us all. With your support, you will be helping to make our communities stronger, more resilient, and pave the way for a more peaceful transition into this new era human re-distribution.  </strong></p>

<h2>The Product</h2>
<p>The Culture Advocate Network is designed to be a social network platform that features the stories and cultures of refugees and climate migrants (aka culture ambassadors). Individuals and/or families will be able to set up profiles such as the one below. Community members (aka culture advocates) will also be able to create simplified profiles to welcome, learn about, and support the culture ambassadors in their community. </p>

<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p><strong>For our communities today:</strong></p>
<p>Currently less than 1% of all refugees resettle. Resettlement is a miracle, something to be celebrated and supported, yet often we isolate the refugees in our communities. We, the very people that crave international foods and go travel the world, turn a blind eye to the world that resides in our communities. There are rich cultures and relationships just waiting to be unveiled.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits</strong> of The Culture Advocate Network <strong>for today </strong>include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Foster culture ambassador integration and empowerment</li>
<li>Increase cultural awareness and acceptance</li>
<li>Encourage intergenerational interactions and relationships</li>
<li>Provide a safe, positive learning space for the youth </li>
<li>Re-learn 'the basics' - values of community, collaboration, family, healthy social interactions &amp; activities, etc</li>
<li>Prime communities for future in-flow of culture ambassadors </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>For our communities in the future: </strong></p>
<p><i>“Right now, we are facing a man-made disaster of a global scale. Our greatest threat in thousands of years: Climate change. If we don’t take action, the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon.”</i></p>
<p><i>— Sir David Attenborough, COP24 (UN Climate Change Conference 2018)</i></p>
<p>Trying to predict the number of climate migrants in the future is a herculean feat, to say the least. The complexity of climate migration leaves us with wild estimates, ranging from 200 million to 1 billion people. We could run models incessantly and argue tirelessly about the numbers as we once did when we first started talking about climate change.  Or, we can accept this era of human re-distribution and prepare for it.  On the to do list: provide legal rights for the environmentally displaced and accept migration as a viable form of adaptation.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits</strong> of the Culture Advocate Network <strong>for the future</strong> include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Showcase that resettled peoples can thrive after forced migration</li>
<li>Provide evidence to support the legal protection of climate migrants </li>
<li>Support smooth and peaceful transitions of the environmentally displaced </li>
<li>Inspire and encourage pro-active adaptation planning for environmentally threatened communities</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

<h2>The Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>Let's face it, this is a United States start-up wanting to address a global issue that our leaders are unwilling to support. Our most influential leaders are absent in the global conversation and efforts preventing, combating, and adapting to climate impacts. There are many that find this topic controversial as well.</p>
<p>These could serve as major hurdles, but I have faith in the power of the people. Thanks to movements such as #RefugeesWelcome, there has been a rise of people with open hearts and minds that I believe will overcome the odds and help make the Culture Advocate Network a global success. This is a 'Love your neighbor' mission and in the end, love conquers all. </p>

<h2>2020 ITASA East Coast Conference: Recognize to Reconnect</h2>
<p>The Intercollegiate Taiwanese American Students Association (ITASA) is a national 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that seeks to connect, inspire, and empower Taiwanese American students across the country. The ITASA East Coast Conference (ECC) is an annual 3 day conference where attendees from different Taiwanese-American Student Associations get together to learn more about their Taiwanese identities through workshops, connect with others, and enjoy fun social events. Each year, ECC brings together over 200 students from across the east coast to share in the celebration of their culture and to learn to leverage their identities and grow in their professional development.</p> <h3>About the Conference</h3>
<p>The 2020 theme, <strong>Recognize to Reconnect</strong>, focuses on the importance of recognizing our Taiwanese identity and the value of reconnecting with our culture to fully embrace our heritage.</p>
<p>Held this year at the <strong>University of Maryland, College Park, from February 6-9, 2020</strong>, the conference will feature workshops with Taiwanese-American changemakers from across the country with themes about the importance of self, culture, and community. We will also be hosting a nationally-recognized keynote speaker with the hope that these messages will inspire the ECC attendees to realize these ideas and inspirations in their own lives, causing an impact beyond the weekend of the conference. </p> <h3>Why Should I Support This Campaign?</h3>
<p>The 2020 ECC team at the University of Maryland is comprised of college students, all working hard on a pro bono basis. The conference is estimated to cost about $20,000, with major parts of the budget including the cost of workshop speakers, venue reservations, and other operational costs. To reach that goal, we are also working to secure funding from sources such as the University of Maryland SGA and our own fundraising initiatives.<strong> Your generous financial support would be greatly appreciated to help us reach our minimum goal of $1000, which we hope to exceed. You will also contribute to the cause of empowering a rising generation of Taiwanese-American youths.</strong></p>
<p>We sincerely ask for your support to help us bring the Taiwanese-American community together to share our narratives and amplify our voices during this very special event. <strong>As a national 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, your donations to us will be tax-deductible.</strong></p> <h3>Workshop Tracks</h3>
<p><strong>Recognize</strong>: ­­­The workshops for this track will focus on the identities that attendees may have pushed aside or not yet discovered. Speakers will share about how they recognized their own identities and how doing so helped to shape who they are today. </p>
<p><strong>Reconnect</strong>: During the workshops for this track, speakers will teach students the importance of self, culture, and community through interactive activities. </p>
<p><strong>Represent</strong>: The workshops for this session will focus on embracing one’s Taiwanese identity and increasing Asian-American representation in media and entertainment, technology, business, leadership, or management. </p> <h3>List of Schools In Attendance</h3>

We celebrated our 25th-anniversary last year – a very significant landmark for an independent film festival, as you will see.The festival has run independently for 25 years thanks to our members, private donors, cultural partners and sponsors. Raindance relies on the community of filmmakers and independent film lovers to achieve its mission in 2018. Your pledge helps achieve these objectives:
Keep discounted tickets for under 25s, students, senior citizens, claimants, first responders and carers.
Support filmmakers from disadvantaged backgrounds to attend the festival(the 25x25 project in collaboration with the Independent Film Trust - a registered charity)
Develop a cutting-edge festival app to cut down on paper waste.
Keep our commemorative catalogue FREE and printed on (more expensive) eco-friendly paper.
Provide access for audiences with hearing and visual disabilities to festival screenings and seminars
Keep independent cinema alive in Leicester Square.

<p>Southside Skatepark is seeking support in funding the down payment on a commercial loan which we have been approved for.  This loan would allow us to move Southside Skatepark from our current rental agreement to a facility we own.  The reduction in operation cost will allow for a better skateboarding facility for the region.  We are hoping to achieve our down payment goal by early 2018, enter into negotiation on a building in January and open the doors no later then March 2018.  </p>
<p>Southside Skatepark established in 1994 has been home to 20 years of the Texas Skate Jam benefiting the Make a Wish Foundation and in that time has helped raise almost $1,000,000 in total donations. More recently we partnered with the skateboarding industry in launching #icleanedoutmyclosetforhouston to provide relief for Hurricane Harvey survivors in need. Our relief efforts continue in the wake of this tragedy to this day. </p>
<p>Southside Skatepark provides a place to congregate and skateboard in peace. We work hard to provide the best indoor skatepark experience in the City of Houston, with it's difficult weather patterns. Southside has hosted many generations of regional up and coming skateboarders in their pursuit of a career in skateboarding. Now is the time to relocate Southside Skatepark and position it to continue tradition for another 23 years of skateboarding. We are committed to providing you an even better indoor skatepark experience at our new facility. We hope you will join us by making a donation, sharing this Kickstarter and doing anything you can to spread the word and keep Southside Skatepark open and operating in Houston for years to come. - Big O, Southside Skatepark</p>
<p>Risks and challenges</p>
<p>Skateparking itself can be very challenging and in 2017 privately run skateparks are few and far between. Southside Skatepark has been operating in South Houston since 1994 and we have been operating Southside since 2007. Those eleven years of experience have been very valuable and allowed us to develop the skills necessary to accomplish this task. We are moving Southside Skatepark to a facility we own in an effort to insure the support of skateboarding in this region for many more years to come.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Our story is a dialogue of cultural flavours between Druze, Christian and Muslim cooks, ingredients and local producers from Israel’s Galilee. Through co-operation and a common love of cooking, we will bring you the rich tastes of traditional Galilean food in a recipe book, so that you can experience this unique cuisine whilst we indulge you in the culinary tales of our cooks and the terroir.</p>
<p>For over 30 years, Ruth Nieman &amp; Paul Nirens have in very different ways been connected with food of the Galilee. By joining forces with their knowledge and enthusiasm for the abundant produce that makes this area so very unique, we are ready to put pen to paper and invite you into the homes of the locals and show off the regional food and culinary culture.</p>

<p>We are two Jewish ‘foodies’ from opposite parts of the globe, whose passion, experiences and adventures with food and cooking workshops of Galileat, found a way of bringing us together and into The Galilean Kitchen…. a cookbook with a difference.</p>
<h3>Our Cookbook:</h3>
<p>The Galilean Kitchen is more than just a recipe book. It is unique in that it displays the very essence of the ethnic and seasonal journey that we will take you on, whilst showing the many ways to prepare authentic dishes like sinye, maklouba and hubeza, that have passed through the generations.</p>
<p>The stories of the women, their heritage, the cultural influences in their cooking together with their own take on the traditional food, give all our recipes credibility and defines the Galilean kitchens of today.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The Galilean Kitchen is a personal, social, ethical and cultural project that we both feel very passionate about and is very close to both of our hearts. Galilean food and cooking is still relatively unknown outside the region and we feel that now is the time for the flavours and recipes to gain recognition in kitchens around the globe, inviting culinary interest, respect and collaboration.</p>
<p>Our joint experiences of food, cooking, Israel and the Galilee gives us the confidence to produce a cookbook of the highest quality. We have enlisted a well-respected photographer and a graphic designer with other published cookbooks to her name, but we need your backing to ensure its success.</p>
<p><strong>We are looking to raise $25,000 to produce, publish and distribute the first edition of The Galilean Kitchen.</strong></p>
<p>Most of our expenses will be covered through book pre-orders on our Indiegogo campaign, so for<strong> $30 place your order for a 'first edition' of The Galilean Kitchen </strong>and experience the cultural flavours of this bountiful region.   </p>
<p>For <strong>$50, you will receive an autographed first edition,</strong> signed by the authors Ruth Nieman and Paul Nirens as well as our photographer Neil Mercer.</p>
<p>There are also many other ways to help us achieve our goal and ensure the success of the project with attractive rewards that capture the flavour of the book. These include <strong>locally sourced spices and olive oil beauty products</strong>, which give authenticity to the recipes, as well as <strong>the ultimate perk of a cooking workshop</strong>, with hands-on cooking of local food in the kitchen of one of our experienced, hospitable cooks.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your generosity in pre-ordering The Galilean Kitchen together with pledging your support for our perks will help us fulfil our ambition of publishing this beautiful cookbook. At the same time, you will be helping us promote co-operation between all the people of the Galilee.</p>

Nestled in San Juan La Laguna, Guatemala on the Northwestern shore of Lake Atitlán, Something magical is being planted.
Nuestra Casa is a sustainable micro hotel that will focus on housing groups when they come to do volunteer work for local nonprofits and other impactful projects. Its goal is to support education in the area of San Juan La Laguna.
Although Nuestra Casa may be a fairly new concept, it has grown out of 18 years of working closely in Guatemala with local school children and the community.
Nuestra Casa will not only provide lodging for visitors, but will also provide a space for people of the community to host meetings and special events. All proceeds from the project will be used to support education in the community.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Bàta nan Salm 2017 Residency will be a community-based Gaelic Arts residency in the heart of Lochs on the Isle of Lewis exploring, re-enacting, recollecting and retelling the stories of the psalmboats of Loch Erisort. For two weeks in August, Gaelic Psalmsingers, sailors, artists, activists and dreamers will settle in to Old Soval Lodge in Kinloch for workshops, talks, meetings and taigh-chèilidhs. Our trips to landing spots, villages and sites around Loch Erisort will be recorded and filmed – with your help! Traditional sailing skippers and boats from Falmadair sailing club will lead us to re-envisage the often treacherous journeys to worship across wide and deep Loch Erisort.</p>
<p>Bàta nan Salm is a unique Gaelic community. A strong belief in the power of story and voice in the Gaelic imagination underpins the entire project. Respect for the faith traditions of all island people is also central to our aims. We invite you to contribute to achieving a lasting legacy for local people, their friends, families and the worldwide Gaelic community – through drama, sound and film. From these riches we will also plan to create a public archive. Your contribution - no matter how small - will support a truly local, grassroots project through which Gaelic speakers, Psalmsingers, sailors and artist-activists are reclaiming their cultural and spiritual inheritance, for the benefit of all.</p>

<h3>The <a href=""http://highfieldhallandgardens.org/art/the-dome/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dome at Highfield</a> will be a temporary, outdoor exhibit from June 15, 2018 – October 15, 2018 on the grounds of Highfield Hall &amp; Gardens. The pop-up Dome is produced by The Dome at Woods Hole, a non-profit organization dedicated to the preservation and rehabilitation of The Dome at the Nautilus, built in 1953 by Buckminster Fuller. </h3>
<p>This pop-up Dome is part of Highfield’s summer exhibit entitled <a href=""http://highfieldhallandgardens.org/art/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">“Out of the Box” </a>which will feature the Dome and other environmental sculptures throughout their grounds and gardens.</p>
<p>The Dome at Highfield is a collaborative project between The Dome at Woods Hole and <a href=""http://highfieldhallandgardens.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Highfield</a>. In keeping with The Dome at Wood Hole’s mission to create a space and forum for interdisciplinary collaboration, innovative thinking and creative making, The Dome at Highfield will introduce the local and regional community to the sorts of programs The Dome at Woods Hole will offer at its future permanent home.</p>
<p>Through exploratory educational programs, social events and communal gatherings, The Dome at Highfield will create opportunities for visitors to experience how the interaction of art, environment, design and technology will come together at The Dome at Woods Hole.</p>
<p>As we work to preserve and rehabilitate the Dome at Woods Hole, we hope the pop-up Dome will provide a space for questions, conversations, and learning alike. </p>
<h3>What We Need:</h3>
<p>In order to build the Dome – we need the materials – specifically 100 2” x 4” x 10feet long boards of pressure-treated Southern Yellow Pine.</p>
<p>We are ‘selling’ each board for $20 which covers the cost of the board, additional materials for construction, and labor.</p>
<p>Designed by Buckminster Fuller's great nephew, architect Deacon Marvel, the pop-up Dome will be a reusable structure, that we intend to bring to additional locations in the future - so your one time contribution will benefit the community for years to come!</p>
<p>In recognition of your contribution, you to will be able to come and sign your board, becoming a permanent part of this dynamic construction! If you are unable to visit the pop-up Dome and sign your own board, your name will be added by one of the local artists from the community to ensure your contribution remains a part of the Dome forever.</p>

<h3>More about the Dome at Woods Hole:</h3>
<p>The Dome at Woods Hole is a non-profit organization dedicated to the promotion of innovative exploration in the arts and sciences.  Located in Buckminster Fuller’s oldest extant geodesic dome, The Dome will be a multi-disciplinary arts, performance and exhibition center bringing world-class contemporary arts to Woods Hole. The mission of The Dome is to build community around the intersection of art, science, technology and the environment.</p>
<p>Buckminster Fuller designed and built the geodesic dome in Woods Hole, Mass., in 1953. Originally constructed as a restaurant, the Dome has been abandoned since 2002 but has proven its architectural genius by standing the test of time since its creation. This iconic structure, which is eligible for listing on the National Register, is a testament to Fuller’s design, simple use of materials and philosophy to do more with less.</p>
<p>The initiative to rehabilitate and revitalize the Dome is underway by a team of dedicated community members and supporting organizations. Exemplifying Fuller’s passion for comprehensive anticipatory design, The Dome at Woods Hole will have exhibition/performance space, a permanent exhibit about Fuller, studios for artist residencies, hospitality amenities and supporting facilities.</p>

</div></div>","The Dome at Highfield will be a temporary, outdoor exhibit from June 15, 2018 – October 15, 2018 on the grounds of Highfield Hall & Gardens. The pop-up Dome is produced by The Dome at Woods Hole, a non-profit organization dedicated to the preservation and rehabilitation of The Dome at the Nautilus, built in 1953 by Buckminster Fuller. 
This pop-up Dome is part of Highfield’s summer exhibit entitled “Out of the Box” which will feature the Dome and other environmental sculptures throughout their grounds and gardens.
The Dome at Highfield is a collaborative project between The Dome at Woods Hole and Highfield. In keeping with The Dome at Wood Hole’s mission to create a space and forum for interdisciplinary collaboration, innovative thinking and creative making, The Dome at Highfield will introduce the local and regional community to the sorts of programs The Dome at Woods Hole will offer at its future permanent home.
Through exploratory educational programs, social events and communal gatherings, The Dome at Highfield will create opportunities for visitors to experience how the interaction of art, environment, design and technology will come together at The Dome at Woods Hole.
As we work to preserve and rehabilitate the Dome at Woods Hole, we hope the pop-up Dome will provide a space for questions, conversations, and learning alike. 
What We Need:
In order to build the Dome – we need the materials – specifically 100 2” x 4” x 10feet long boards of pressure-treated Southern Yellow Pine.
We are ‘selling’ each board for $20 which covers the cost of the board, additional materials for construction, and labor.
Designed by Buckminster Fuller's great nephew, architect Deacon Marvel, the pop-up Dome will be a reusable structure, that we intend to bring to additional locations in the future - so your one time contribution will benefit the community for years to come!
In recognition of your contribution, you to will be able to come and sign your board, becoming a permanent part of this dynamic construction! If you are unable to visit the pop-up Dome and sign your own board, your name will be added by one of the local artists from the community to ensure your contribution remains a part of the Dome forever.
If we do not reach our goal, all donations will go towards defraying the cost of materials. 
Programming at the Dome at Highfield:
Visitors to Highfield will have full access to visit The Dome. In addition to educational programming in and around The Dome at Highfield, there will be several special events:

A Family Night Concert on Wednesday, July 25th featuring local band Crooked Coast and several local food trucks

The founder of Cittadino Nel Mondo, Natalia Bieganska, is an artist who has travelled the world extensively and has been deeply<strong> inspired by local cultures</strong>.

Campagnano di Roma was on the Via Francigena in medieval times, an ancient road running from France to Rome. The area is filled with ancient Roman and Etruscan history; the energy of painters, sculptors and other makers of the past can almost be smelt in the air.</p><p> </p><p><strong><u>C O N C E P T: </u></strong></p><p><strong>LEARNING ABOUT LOCAL SUSTAINABILITY:</strong> </p><p>Each Cittadino Nel Mondo<strong> program implies a theme that fits well with the surrounding region and culture</strong>.

Cittadino nel Mondo provides to the participants <strong>organic products of everyday use and promotes minimal waste living.</strong> Artists will participate and learn about organic olive oil farming and production from the local Italian family. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><u><strong>O R G A N I Z E R S:</strong></u></p><p><strong>NATALIA BIEGANSKA</strong></p><p>FOUNDER AND DIRECTOR</p><p>Natalia has been in the fashion and art world for the last 9 years.

Cittadino Nel Mondo residencies are 'pop-up residency's', created in different locations around the world from the far east like Japan to Italy and other locations. The founder of Cittadino Nel Mondo, Natalia Bieganska, is an artist who has travelled the world extensively and has been deeply inspired by local cultures. As a result of her travels, Natalia has a strong mission to connect artists from different countries and backgrounds. Art for her is a new language, universal in nature, breaking down any cultural differences.   LOCATION:This year's residency will take place in Italy, the birthplace of some of the most famous artists in history. The program will support the artist to disconnect from city life and work on their art in a warm and rustic setting in the Italian countryside.  The residency is based in the small village Campagnano di Roma, which is located roughly 45 minutes from Rome and easily accessible by car or train. Campagnano di Roma was on the Via Francigena in medieval times, an ancient road running from France to Rome. The area is filled with ancient Roman and Etruscan history; the energy of painters, sculptors and other makers of the past can almost be smelt in the air. C O N C E P T: LEARNING ABOUT LOCAL SUSTAINABILITY: Each Cittadino Nel Mondo program implies a theme that fits well with the surrounding region and culture. Besides the creative aspect, a core mission of Cittadino Nel Mondo in Campagnano is to take care of nature by teaching artist about sustainability, raising awareness of the local environment, and the production of healthy local foods. Cittadino nel Mondo provides to the participants organic products of everyday use and promotes minimal waste living. Artists will participate and learn about organic olive oil farming and production from the local Italian family.   O R G A N I Z E R S:NATALIA BIEGANSKAFOUNDER AND DIRECTORNatalia has been in the fashion and art world for the last 9 years.

<h3>About Us And Our Campaign:</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Hoolipack</strong> Is the only clothing brand and music collective in the world that clothes any homeless person with every purchase of attire. The ""<i>Hooli</i>"" in <strong>Hoolipack</strong> stands for <u>Hooligan,</u> the reckless dreamer who goes against society to make sure that they are as free as possible to be themselves and achieve their dreams. We reside in the city of Los Angeles where skid row has been an ongoing issue for as long as we can remember. They say you are only as good as your weakest link, and here in the United States, this can be considered our weakest link. We strive to help bring awareness to this ongoing issue, clothe these individuals, spark change in our community and around the world!</li>
<li>This campaign is close to our hearts and we feel for these individuals, to the point that we structure our business around helping them. We have talked with many of these individuals and found that what they need most are hoodies, socks, and blankets. We decided hoodies would be a great place to start and with your help we can provide for our brothers and sisters in need. Every donation is a contribution to spark change by helping us to raise the necessary funds to clothe all of skid row. Our hoodies would help to keep them warm at night while also expressing their own individual ties to being a  ""<i>Hooligan<strong>"" </strong></i>and raising awareness about this ongoing issue.</li>
<li>We are here to bridge the gap between society and what <i>they</i> would call ""the needy"" or ""bums"", who really are just people like any of us. Anyone can end up homeless, even <strong>YOU</strong> can end up homeless...Its all about circumstance. You can help us spread awareness about this issue to help these people that are simply stuck in the mud or could be dealing with mental illness, substance abuse, neglect, and lack of resources. </li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

<li>With <strong>EVERY</strong> contribution, we are helping this social injustice that is forced upon our people.

<li>We aim to spark change in our community for others to get up, open your heart, and help those in need with open arms and shift their perspective on what community <i>really</i> is. By raising awareness about this situation we hope to open doors for people in other communities  with the same issues, starting a ripple effect.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>Since childhood, we have been aware of this ongoing issue and for many of us our parents would say ""Don't give them any money, they might use that money to buy drugs instead of buying food or trying to survive"", but honestly how can we prejudge these people without knowing what they have been through to bring them there. After all they are human just like us and deserve to be treated as such.</li>
<li>We have had to overcome naysayers or people who don't believe having something clean and warm to wear is a necessity. Our response to that is - Dignity is a basic human right.</li>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that some people may not be able to contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p>

Hoolipack Is the only clothing brand and music collective in the world that clothes any homeless person with every purchase of attire. The ""Hooli"" in Hoolipack stands for Hooligan, the reckless dreamer who goes against society to make sure that they are as free as possible to be themselves and achieve their dreams. We reside in the city of Los Angeles where skid row has been an ongoing issue for as long as we can remember. They say you are only as good as your weakest link, and here in the United States, this can be considered our weakest link. We strive to help bring awareness to this ongoing issue, clothe these individuals, spark change in our community and around the world!
This campaign is close to our hearts and we feel for these individuals, to the point that we structure our business around helping them. We have talked with many of these individuals and found that what they need most are hoodies, socks, and blankets. We decided hoodies would be a great place to start and with your help we can provide for our brothers and sisters in need. Every donation is a contribution to spark change by helping us to raise the necessary funds to clothe all of skid row. Our hoodies would help to keep them warm at night while also expressing their own individual ties to being a  ""Hooligan"" and raising awareness about this ongoing issue.
We are here to bridge the gap between society and what they would call ""the needy"" or ""bums"", who really are just people like any of us. Anyone can end up homeless, even YOU can end up homeless...Its all about circumstance. You can help us spread awareness about this issue to help these people that are simply stuck in the mud or could be dealing with mental illness, substance abuse, neglect, and lack of resources. 



What We Need & What You Get

We did the research and in order to provide the homeless with our hoodies, we would need to raise roughly $60,000 in donations.
If you donate over $100, you will receive a Hoolipack Hoodie for yourself after we clothe those in need on skid row.


The Impact

With EVERY contribution, we are helping this social injustice that is forced upon our people. Every time a hoodie is purchased, we personally go down to skid row and talk to these individuals to hear their stories and  testimonies hoping to brighten up their day and leave them with a smile on their face knowing that someone cares enough to contribute. 
We aim to spark change in our community for others to get up, open your heart, and help those in need with open arms and shift their perspective on what community really is. By raising awareness about this situation we hope to open doors for people in other communities  with the same issues, starting a ripple effect.


Risks & Challenges

Since childhood, we have been aware of this ongoing issue and for many of us our parents would say ""Don't give them any money, they might use that money to buy drugs instead of buying food or trying to survive"", but honestly how can we prejudge these people without knowing what they have been through to bring them there. After all they are human just like us and deserve to be treated as such.
We have had to overcome naysayers or people who don't believe having something clean and warm to wear is a necessity. Our response to that is - Dignity is a basic human right.

'We' are the team behind Kenilworth Arts Festival: a not-for-profit festival that takes place in Kenilworth. The festival is an entirely voluntary organisation - we come from a variety of backgrounds and are united by a desire to create something extraordinary in the green heart of Warwickshire. Our committee consists of students, teachers, editors, actors, jazz club co-coordinators, bookshop owners, musicians, clay modellers, composers, parents, pensioners and project managers. As well as enthusiasm for the arts, our members bring experience with community projects and longstanding connections to local businesses and charities.</p><h3><u><strong>What are we trying to achieve?</strong></u></h3><p>The idea behind Kenilworth Arts Festival is to offer opportunities for people of all ages to engage with the creative arts. We want to bring together some of the finest contemporary music, literature, theatre and art from across the country, as well as to offer a platform for bright local talent. Rather than confining ourselves to any particular genre or style, our line-ups strive to reflect exciting developments across the broadest spectrum of culture, exhibiting the current creative landscape at its best. We also want to use our programme as a way to ask brave questions of the world around us and encourage bold, new thinking. In short, we want to transform the historic town of Kenilworth into a hive of creative exploration; a celebration of art, imagination, innovation and community.</p><p>The inaugural Kenilworth Arts Festival took place in September 2016. The programme featured headline events, workshops and a free, outdoor event that attracted over 4,000 people. We hosted a number of award-winning, critically acclaimed artists from a variety of genres, including folk, jazz and classical music, nature writing, poetry, screen writing and human rights journalism. </p><ul></ul><p>Having laid these strong foundations, we want to grow the festival this year.  Our 2017 festival will run from the 17th - 23rd September. As well as the headline events, workshops and our outdoor event, we want to offer more events, run long-term projects with local groups, support organic community-led events and have a bigger presence in the town throughout the week and beyond. We want to do more to support original art and young artists by hosting showcase events, running competitions and encouraging collaborations.  In short, we want to grow Kenilworth Arts Festival into one of the most innovative, distinctive festivals in the region. We believe there is potential to build something truly extraordinary, particularly through our multi-genre approach and our commitment to supporting new work.</p><p><strong>Some comments from last year’s performers:</strong></p><ul>
<li> “Run by people with a conscious desire to celebrate the writing, music, poetry and art they actually love, Kenilworth Arts is a wonderful home-grown festival with heart. (<i>Rob Cowen, journalist and author)</i>
</li>
<li>“Kenilworth Arts Festival is fantastic. I do two or three readings a month in various different places, but this really stood out to me for the quality of the other acts, the warmth and responsiveness of the audience and the professionalism and thoughtfulness of the organisers.""<i>(Luke Kennard, poet and fiction writer)</i>
</li>
<li>
<strong>“</strong>Kenilworth Arts Festival is the sort of festival I would like to go to all the time. I wish it was always there, at the end of a long drive. It has such good and noble intentions; bringing creativity and curiosity to the forefront of people's minds.” <i>(Rachel Sermanni, folk musician)</i>
</li>
<li>“The Kenilworth Arts Festival was one of the very best events I have been involved in. Its ability to put world-class musicians and writers in front of audiences is so admirable, and there is a real feel of the festival being at the hub of this strong community.<strong>” </strong><i>(Jonathan Edwards, poet)</i>
</li>
</ul><p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486122446/ypvbwx89xqktiy0la100.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></i></p><ul></ul><h3><u><strong>How you can help</strong></u></h3><p>We got things up and running last year. We have the ideas, as well as the long-term vision. What we need now is a boost to help us step up a level. By supporting our crowdfunding campaign, you'll be helping us to realise some of the ambitions laid out above. More materially, your support can help us to: cover costs of venue hire for fringe events, expand our line up, pay people fairly for their time and creativity, invest in better decorations (extreme yarn-bombing, anyone?), provide food and drink for our volunteers and improve the environmental impact of our events. </p><p>In return, you can get your hands on some rather lovely rewards. Even if you're on the other side of the world (*sings that KT Tunstall song*), we have something for you. At the very least, every backer will receive a handwritten note of thanks and will be acknowledged in the festival programme.

'We' are the team behind Kenilworth Arts Festival: a not-for-profit festival that takes place in Kenilworth. The festival is an entirely voluntary organisation - we come from a variety of backgrounds and are united by a desire to create something extraordinary in the green heart of Warwickshire. Our committee consists of students, teachers, editors, actors, jazz club co-coordinators, bookshop owners, musicians, clay modellers, composers, parents, pensioners and project managers. As well as enthusiasm for the arts, our members bring experience with community projects and longstanding connections to local businesses and charities.What are we trying to achieve?The idea behind Kenilworth Arts Festival is to offer opportunities for people of all ages to engage with the creative arts. We want to bring together some of the finest contemporary music, literature, theatre and art from across the country, as well as to offer a platform for bright local talent. Rather than confining ourselves to any particular genre or style, our line-ups strive to reflect exciting developments across the broadest spectrum of culture, exhibiting the current creative landscape at its best. We also want to use our programme as a way to ask brave questions of the world around us and encourage bold, new thinking. In short, we want to transform the historic town of Kenilworth into a hive of creative exploration; a celebration of art, imagination, innovation and community.The inaugural Kenilworth Arts Festival took place in September 2016. The programme featured headline events, workshops and a free, outdoor event that attracted over 4,000 people. We hosted a number of award-winning, critically acclaimed artists from a variety of genres, including folk, jazz and classical music, nature writing, poetry, screen writing and human rights journalism. Having laid these strong foundations, we want to grow the festival this year.  Our 2017 festival will run from the 17th - 23rd September. As well as the headline events, workshops and our outdoor event, we want to offer more events, run long-term projects with local groups, support organic community-led events and have a bigger presence in the town throughout the week and beyond. We want to do more to support original art and young artists by hosting showcase events, running competitions and encouraging collaborations.  In short, we want to grow Kenilworth Arts Festival into one of the most innovative, distinctive festivals in the region. We believe there is potential to build something truly extraordinary, particularly through our multi-genre approach and our commitment to supporting new work.Some comments from last year’s performers:
 “Run by people with a conscious desire to celebrate the writing, music, poetry and art they actually love, Kenilworth Arts is a wonderful home-grown festival with heart. (Rob Cowen, journalist and author)

“Kenilworth Arts Festival is fantastic. I do two or three readings a month in various different places, but this really stood out to me for the quality of the other acts, the warmth and responsiveness of the audience and the professionalism and thoughtfulness of the organisers.""(Luke Kennard, poet and fiction writer)


“Kenilworth Arts Festival is the sort of festival I would like to go to all the time. I wish it was always there, at the end of a long drive. It has such good and noble intentions; bringing creativity and curiosity to the forefront of people's minds.” (Rachel Sermanni, folk musician)

“The Kenilworth Arts Festival was one of the very best events I have been involved in. Its ability to put world-class musicians and writers in front of audiences is so admirable, and there is a real feel of the festival being at the hub of this strong community.” (Jonathan Edwards, poet)

How you can helpWe got things up and running last year. We have the ideas, as well as the long-term vision. What we need now is a boost to help us step up a level. By supporting our crowdfunding campaign, you'll be helping us to realise some of the ambitions laid out above. More materially, your support can help us to: cover costs of venue hire for fringe events, expand our line up, pay people fairly for their time and creativity, invest in better decorations (extreme yarn-bombing, anyone?), provide food and drink for our volunteers and improve the environmental impact of our events. In return, you can get your hands on some rather lovely rewards. Even if you're on the other side of the world (*sings that KT Tunstall song*), we have something for you. At the very least, every backer will receive a handwritten note of thanks and will be acknowledged in the festival programme. We want to recognise and celebrate the fact that this is a team effort: if we work together, we can make something magical happen! Other Ways To Get InvolvedThere are plenty of ways to get involved beyond this crowdfunding campaign. If you'd like to volunteer or perform in some capacity, drop us a note at: info@kenilworthartsfestival.co.uk.

The project SEEDS_I play with Mozart consists in a journey from Italy to Greece, retracing in reverse the Balkan route that refugees and migrants follow when trying to escape from poverty and war.We aim to:
produce a high-quality music album “SEEDS”, in collaboration with professionals (refugees, migrants, locals and international artists) we meet along the way;
produce a documentary of the journey “I PLAY WITH MOZART”, documenting the trip in all its features;
create a photo-book and a logbook of the journey;
celebrate music and spread a message of hope - a Seed of Hope for Syria - with a final concert in Thessaloniki at the end of the tour;
raising awareness campaign about the refugee crisis in the Balkans.
What is AlphaArt?Il Fuoco 1775 - AlphaArt is a grassroots artistic movement started by Isaac de Martin & Alaa Arsheed in 2015.Il Fuoco 1775 implements a project, AlphaArt, which has the aim to propose the concept of an international Art Gallery, such as the one established by the Arsheed Family in Al Sweida (Syria), called Alpha. Alpha Art Gallery - Al Sweida was a place where arts, such as painting, music, cinema and theatre could find expression and be displayed. Alpha Art Gallery - Al Sweida hosted shows, lectures, concerts and performances by artists from all over Syria and the Middle East. Their library and literary cafe were accessible to the general public. Unfortunately in 2011 Alpha Art Gallery - Al Sweida was destroyed by a group of fanatics, snuffing out a vital platform for the arts and ending forever the artistic movement that the Arsheed family had initiated.Il Fuoco 1775 - AlphaArt  Started in Italy  by Alaa Arsheed  and Isaac de Martin as a tool to light a fire of arts, and with time it has evolved into a tool to raise awareness about the refugee crisis. The effort is successful due to the various collaborations established with international artists and organizations.Who are Alaa and Isaac?Alaa Arsheed is musician and composer from Syria. Together with his brother and two sisters, he was part of a string quartet performing in Syria and in neighboring countries, such as Lebanon. Unfortunately, after the escalation of the war in Syria, Alaa and his siblings were forced to dissolve the group, but Alaa’s talent allowed him to win a sponsorship and come to Italy in 2015, where he produced his album “SHAM”.Not long after his arrival, Alaa met Isaac de Martin as part of a music project. Isaac is a musician and composer, from the Venetian countryside (Italy). He graduated from the Conservatory and he is involved in many activities: production of music for theater and cinema, concerts with the ""Adovabadan Jazz Band"" - from 2005 - and the collective “Sound Illustrators”, AlphaArt cultural association, and he is about to release his new album “Construction Site”.Together they started the collective ""The Portrait"" .From the moment they met, Alaa and Isaac not only initiated a successful and fruitful artistic collaboration, but also developed a deep friendship which will now lead them across the Balkans together.What is SEEDS_I play with Mozart?SEEDS_I play with Mozart consists in a reverse journey along the Balkan Route, where refugee and migrants travel with the hope of starting a new life, away from poverty and war. However, SEEDS_I play with Mozart not only has the humanitarian objective of raising awareness among the international community about the situation of the refugee crisis in the Balkans, but  also has an highly relevant artistic objective. Through this project, Alaa and Isaac want to emphasize that art – especially music – can serve as a primary tool to connect people, acting as a universal language capable of destroying any physical or cultural barrier.Let’s take a look at the specific activities SEEDS_I play with Mozart intends to implement along its journey. We will:
Conduct interviews with refugees and asylum seekers who tell us their stories, expectations and feelings, side by side with interviews with locals and humanitarian professionals.
Document the activities that SEEDS_I play with Mozart carries out both inside and outside of the refugee camps through videos and photos taken along the entire route.

Compose and record single tracks with international artists from all over the world during our journey.

Donate musical instruments, cameras, colors and painting material to the people we meet promoting the healing qualities of art.
Organize workshops and lessons for both adults and children (music, dance, theater, photography, painting).
Creating opportunities for playful activities for kids such as setting up face painting.
Develop artistic collaborations with local organizations and artists.
Organize a final concert and performance in Thessaloniki, Greece.
 Moreover, we will take with us some apple-seeds, that we will plant at all the stepovers of our journey with the people we will meet and with whom will collaborate with us, as a sign of growing hope! In some years there will be a map of strong apple trees documenting our journey of hope from Italy down to Greece!  Where will we go and who will we meet?SEEDS_I play with Mozart will start from Italy (Udine), and then travel across Slovenia, Hungary (Budapest), Romania (Timisoara), Serbia (Belgrade), Bulgaria (Sofia and Plovdiv), Macedonia and Greece (Thessaloniki) for 1 month, 8th August - 8th September.

Their freethinking ideas influence lives to this day, but their specific roles and contributions are fading from our collective memory.</p>

It's got a similar vibe to when the Old Blue Last was the coolest place to go in London. A place where everything from small local artists to big international acts come and do small and intimate, but amazing shows. It's a place for the alternative young adults to hang out, a place that is badly needed to nurture an original music and art scene in Lilongwe. I think, for Malawi, Grittah's will be one of these places that goes down in history of being, 'the place', where everyone played and started their career.""  - Johan Hugo, THE VERY BEST</i></p><p>There aren't many places left in the world that focus their energies on promoting the talent of upcoming artists. It's not where the money is. But without such a platform, new artists have no way to develop into the valuable members of society that they may become.

There currently isn't a cinema in Malawi, so we can forget about that, but there is a music venue, and we desperately need to buy our own sound system for live shows. We're not looking for the highest quality system in the world, just some speakers and microphones that give a clear sound, a drum kit that has all the parts, and cables that don't crackle and cut out. But even these basic things are very expensive in Malawi, and there is nowhere to get such goods second hand.<br/>    We have stayed open for 2 years without our own gear, but this was much easier in the first year, when were able to call in on many favours from those in the music world, so thrilled with what we were doing. But such favours become burdensome after a point, and in our second year we've had a lot less events, due to the struggle to find the necessary equipment to put on a show. The positive side though, is that in those two years we've managed to put together a fantastic events team, as well as garnered a brilliant reputation both locally and internationally. With our own equipment we'll be able to move wholeheartedly towards out dream of having a world class music venue in Lilongwe.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><br/>   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543385035/m8vfgmywsfvnlvvq4wyz.jpg"" src=""""/><i>Drum kit has seen better days</i>    <br/> </p><p><b>Who Benefits</b></p><p>   <i> ""One of the artists that has benefitted a lot from Grittah's Camp is me, apart from being in a band called Krazy Colours, I also perform as a solo artist. Grittah's Camp has helped me grow in music. I no longer fear whenever I want to perform, I now go place to place within and outside Lilongwe, it has given me courage to work extra hard. It has helped me to meet a lot of big artists who encourage and teach many things I didn't know. Grittah's Camp has brought big artists to perform in a ghetto area like CCDC-Chilinde, and has given hope to a lot of people, especially the community. They have a chance to watch big artists, international artists and even upcoming artists.

They're a unique, all girl rock band, who all come from the area. Here shooting a music video for 'Moyo Wanga' - My Life</i></p><p>   I decided I wanted to be a musician when I was 20, and during those first years, I played two to three nights a week at open mic events, and small concerts around London. On the other side of the spectrum you have The Beatles, who played 5 nights a week in Berlin for 2 years, which is how they became so good. It can't be underestimated how important it is for musicians to play in front of an audience in order to develop. When I arrived in Malawi there was no such thing as an open mic. It was through such an event, that we started, that Madalitso Band were discovered, who are now touring the world through their music. By putting on regular shows for younger artists, we offer them a space to grow, as well as to connect with new audiences.<br/>    There are also not may places around that are capable of bringing together such a wide demographic of people. There are nights at Grittah's Camp where a Norwegian Ambassador may be sitting next to a shoe shine boy from the ghetto, where a world famous jazz musician shares the stage with a young hip hop artist. The fact that we're located just at the edge of the ghetto is very important. The people from the area had no option to see cultural events before we opened, but because it's also not far from town, the middle class folks also love to come, as it's a way of getting back to their roots.

It's got a similar vibe to when the Old Blue Last was the coolest place to go in London. A place where everything from small local artists to big international acts come and do small and intimate, but amazing shows. It's a place for the alternative young adults to hang out, a place that is badly needed to nurture an original music and art scene in Lilongwe. I think, for Malawi, Grittah's will be one of these places that goes down in history of being, 'the place', where everyone played and started their career.""  - Johan Hugo, THE VERY BESTThere aren't many places left in the world that focus their energies on promoting the talent of upcoming artists. It's not where the money is. But without such a platform, new artists have no way to develop into the valuable members of society that they may become. Malawi doesn't have a highly developed music industry as you may find in other countries, and Grittah's Camp provides one of the very few stepping stones available.How the place looks when we have pro sound and light, during a British Council Funded concert of Gaika. Production cost £1,000 for one night. If we raise the £10,000 we'll have this quality at every event. What we need    Just as a cinema needs a screen, so does a music venue need a sound system. There currently isn't a cinema in Malawi, so we can forget about that, but there is a music venue, and we desperately need to buy our own sound system for live shows. We're not looking for the highest quality system in the world, just some speakers and microphones that give a clear sound, a drum kit that has all the parts, and cables that don't crackle and cut out. But even these basic things are very expensive in Malawi, and there is nowhere to get such goods second hand.    We have stayed open for 2 years without our own gear, but this was much easier in the first year, when were able to call in on many favours from those in the music world, so thrilled with what we were doing. But such favours become burdensome after a point, and in our second year we've had a lot less events, due to the struggle to find the necessary equipment to put on a show. The positive side though, is that in those two years we've managed to put together a fantastic events team, as well as garnered a brilliant reputation both locally and internationally. With our own equipment we'll be able to move wholeheartedly towards out dream of having a world class music venue in Lilongwe.   Drum kit has seen better days     Who Benefits    ""One of the artists that has benefitted a lot from Grittah's Camp is me, apart from being in a band called Krazy Colours, I also perform as a solo artist. Grittah's Camp has helped me grow in music. I no longer fear whenever I want to perform, I now go place to place within and outside Lilongwe, it has given me courage to work extra hard. It has helped me to meet a lot of big artists who encourage and teach many things I didn't know. Grittah's Camp has brought big artists to perform in a ghetto area like CCDC-Chilinde, and has given hope to a lot of people, especially the community. They have a chance to watch big artists, international artists and even upcoming artists. Grittah's Camp is just like a second home to me."" - Cynthia Phiri, KRAZY COLOURSKrazy Colours have grown massively through playing over 20 concerts at Grittahs. They're a unique, all girl rock band, who all come from the area. Here shooting a music video for 'Moyo Wanga' - My Life   I decided I wanted to be a musician when I was 20, and during those first years, I played two to three nights a week at open mic events, and small concerts around London. On the other side of the spectrum you have The Beatles, who played 5 nights a week in Berlin for 2 years, which is how they became so good. It can't be underestimated how important it is for musicians to play in front of an audience in order to develop. When I arrived in Malawi there was no such thing as an open mic. It was through such an event, that we started, that Madalitso Band were discovered, who are now touring the world through their music. By putting on regular shows for younger artists, we offer them a space to grow, as well as to connect with new audiences.    There are also not may places around that are capable of bringing together such a wide demographic of people. There are nights at Grittah's Camp where a Norwegian Ambassador may be sitting next to a shoe shine boy from the ghetto, where a world famous jazz musician shares the stage with a young hip hop artist. The fact that we're located just at the edge of the ghetto is very important. The people from the area had no option to see cultural events before we opened, but because it's also not far from town, the middle class folks also love to come, as it's a way of getting back to their roots. Music bringing people together!        ""Grittahs Camp is a beautiful combination of art, culture and music. It's an amazing platform for all musicians, upcoming, local, and international. It is the perfect place to meet new people and interact with the community while enjoying the rhythms and sounds of Malawi."" - Yolanda Ng'oma LAKE OF STARS FESTIVAL        Apart from putting on music, theatre, dance and poetry events, Grittah's also runs an affordable rehearsal space, conducts workshops with local schools, and as the venue grows, we hope to build a library, have music camps, record and produce live show dvds, and eventually become the first ghetto spot in Malawi to have free Wi-Fi. Rewards    If you're new to crowdfunding, it works on the principle that you give us some of your hard earned money, and in return, you're able to support something that you believe in. In addition we offer certain rewards that are unique to the particular project. Since it's a music venue, these rewards will be things such as free entry to events, downloads of a compilation of music from bands that play here, t-shirts, having a room in the venue named after you, and free hire of the space for your family and friends, with a band of your choosing.    Anything you can manage to support us with will be greatly appreciated. In addition to money, just the fact that you're reading this is amazing, and if you are inspired, please share with your contacts, as it's like this that the campaign will grow, and that we'll have a chance of making our dreams a reality. T-shirts can come in a variety of colours, with a simple text on the back.     Risks and Challenges        Running a music venue in Lilongwe is a risk in itself, and having our own equipment will surely bring in new challenges. Number one of these will be to make sure the equipment is well maintained, so that it can keep functioning for many years to come. Since we have built ourselves a solid events team of people knowledgable and experienced when it comes to live sound, we're sure we'll be able to achieve this.

FUTUROLOGY Portfolio Prints 


A tradition among print studios including A/P, limited edition print portfolios are often created to celebrate anniversaries and to showcase exceptional work by current members.
The portfolios, and the prints within them, become treasured pieces of local and regional print history, containing works by many artists who rise to become notable in their medium.

Prior A/P anniversary portfolios for example, include works by well-known artists and former directors and members such as D. Helen Mackie RCA and Bill Laing RCA, among others.

Each of the 25 artists participating in this year's FUTUROLOGY portfolio were selected by an independent juror with expertise in original works on paper that are each 11"" x 15"" in size.
The full list of artists is provided below, and includes university instructors and other established and emerging professional artists.

<p>My name is Sarah DeWoskin . I am a Jewish educator in South Florida and the Director and Founder of LCM. I am a mom to an almost 13 year old and twin 10 year olds. I am a student, gaining my masters in Jewish educational leadership through HUC-JIR . I am a passionate human being working to change my little corner of the world and I would love your help!</p>
<p>A tiny home craze has hit our nation and it's about to hit the Jewish community, not with tiny kitchens and bathrooms, but with unique pieces of a Jewish children’s museum where kids can climb aboard and explore!</p>
<p>LEV has the capability of making an enormous difference; In helping more people find a connection to their Judaism, in infusing added creativity into traditional institutions and in offering a setting where all families, regardless of background, can explore Jewish culture. </p>
<p><strong>What We Need, What You Get &amp; The Impact</strong></p>
<p>In order to build LEV’s first tiny home, I need to raise $250,000. I have currently raised $100,000. I am looking for someone who is willing and able to take a leap… to financially support something not yet fully proven, to trust in the power of passion and innovation.</p>
<p>Are you someone who cares about the Jewish people, about people travelling along their own Jewish paths, and about the importance of people working to better this world? Please help us reach our goal of building LEV’s first tiny home, of effecting change in our little corner of the world and far beyond!</p>
<p>As a Rabbi’s kid, a Rabbi's wife, and an educator who spent the last 20 years working in various Jewish settings I believe in the importance of legacy institutions. I also have this passion burning inside of me for this startup being my way of engaging more people in writing their Jewish stories. LEV is a mode of collaboration between innovation and tradition. We are all out for the same goal and need to work together. </p>
<p>Giving a gift to LEV Children’s Museum is one way to make your mark in ensuring that the Jews of today and tomorrow have opportunities for hands-on Jewish exploration; of making your mark as a pioneer of this startup that will work tirelessly toward an exciting and engaging Jewish future for our children.</p>

Idealismus war und ist die treibende Kraft.Die Kombination von Skatehalle und Musik-Club im ersten Stock einer ehemaligen Fabrikhalle macht die Location einzigartig in Karlsruhe und auch weit darüber hinaus... Nicht nur der besondere Flair der Halle, auch die verschiedenen Veranstaltungen tragen dazu bei, dass immer wieder aufs Neue eine tolle Atmosphäre und eine super Stimmung entsteht.Neben (teilweise) internationalen hochkarätigen Topacts, wird hier vor allem der regionalen Musikszene und ihrem Nachwuchs eine Bühne geboten, die auch schon europaweit erfolgreiche Künstler hervorbrachte!!!    ♪♫ Egal ob Goa, Reggae/Dancehall, Techno, Drum&Bass, usw. ♫♪Alle Veranstaltungen finden in einer friedlichen, eher familiärer Umgebung statt und ist geprägt von Toleranz und Offenheit...Auch in der überregionalen Skateboardszene ist die Halle sehr beliebt, was sich bei spektakulären Contests mit Teilnehmern aus ganz Deutschland immer wieder zeigt.Ein Ort für Subkultur, der aus Karlsruhe eigentlich nicht mehr wegzudenken ist!!!_____________________________________________________________________________Nun gibt es jedoch seit bestehen der RRB immer wieder Probleme mit den Nachbarn aufgrund der LAUTSTÄRKE..._____________________________________________________________________________Dieser Konflikt droht zu eskalieren, und kann dazu führen, daß der Club schließen muss, falls nicht in absehbarer Zeit eine Verbesserung des Schallschutzes gewährleistet wird!In der Vergangenheit wurden schon mindestens 6000 Euro für Schallschutzmaßnahmen an der Fassade investiert!Die verbliebene Schwachstelle ist nur noch das Dach. Hierzu erfordert es eine aufwändige Konstruktion, um effektiv den Schall zu dämmen. Diese Deckenkonstruktion wird daher sehr kostspielig und ist alleine von der RRB leider nicht zu stemmen. Es handelt sich um mindestens 6500 Euro, die für das Vorhaben benötigt werden. Diese Summe deckt nur den Materialaufwand!!!Die handwerkliche Arbeit wird in bewährt solider Eigenarbeit getätigt und es entstehen dadurch keine weiteren Kosten (für Handwerker o.Ä.).Baubeginn soll direkt nach erfolgreichem Kampagne-Ende erfolgen. Ca. 3 Wochen Bauzeit sind geplant. ▁ ▂ ▃ ▄ ▅ ▆ Jetzt seit ihr gefragt! ▆ ▅ ▄ ▃ ▂ ▁Wollt ihr euren Teil zum Erhalt und Optimierung der RRB beitragen? Durch eine Spende könnt ihr dafür sorgen, dass die RRB der Szene noch viele weitere Jahre erhalten bleibt und dass wir auch weiterhin ausgelassen feiern können!!!Eure Spende soll aber nicht ""umsonst"" sein und nur dem guten Zweck dienen, ihr bekommt je nach Höhe der Zuwendung ein attraktives Dankeschön in Form von sogenannten ""Perks"". ▶ Was genau dahinter steckt, könnt ihr unter der Rubrik ""Perks"" erfahren :) Falls mehr Spenden generiert werden, als für den Schallschutz erforderlich, könnte für die Zukunft in eine noch bessere Musikanlage und in neue Deko, Lichttechnik usw. investiert werden!!!Wer nicht Online spenden kann bzw. möchte, der kann auch gerne vor Ort mit einer Spende dazu beitragen, dass dieser Club weiterhin in Karlsruhe bestehen bleibt! Durch teilen der Kampagne auf den gängigen sozialen Netzwerken und durch Mundpropaganda könnt ihr ebenfalls dazu beitragen, dass diese Aktion ein Erfolg wird!!!Leider könnt ihr hier bei Indiegogo nur mit Kreditkarte und Apple Pay spenden. Wer keine Kreditkarte hat, aber die Überweisung trotzdem Online tätigen möchte, kann auch gerne seine Spende direkt auf das Konto der Rock&RollBar überweisen!Natürlich bekommt auch jeder, der eine Bargeld Spende vor Ort oder eine Onlinespende direkt auf das RRB-Konto tätigt, das ""Dankeschön"" wie es hier angeboten wird!Bankverbindung: Mathias Stäudlin, Postbank Karlsruhe, IBAN: DE22 6601 0075 0446 8157 54, BIC: PBNKDEFF,  Stichwort ""Schallschutz""Vielen Dank schonmal für eure Unterstützung und auf weitere unvergessliche Jahre!!! ❤Euer Rock&RollBar-Team",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

So, we offer<strong> free or low cost participation</strong> in our programs &amp;/or admission to our exhibits and special events.  </p><p>We work hard to do this because we believe anyone should have the opportunity to participate in or experience the arts and its many benefits, including social inclusion, critical thinking, confidence building, creative problem solving, and health and mental wellness. <br/><br/>In the past, Critical Mass has brought contemporary art experiences to public spaces, and has gained <strong>a reputation for doing 'big things' in our small town</strong> – pop up art events, installations, and festivals. We really want to keep up this goodwill and continue that momentum for community engagement this summer with a <strong>Critical Massive Adventure.</strong> <br/><br/>We are a small and mighty team, but...</p><h3><strong>We need YOU to be the HERO in our story! </strong></h3><p>By supporting our campaign, you will help us pay artists, while also allowing us to offer free admission to the festival.

However, we have been crunching the numbers and we can get creative to make something magical happen for $10,000 - $15,000 if need be. That's enough to cover the costs to hire artists, musicians, sound technicians and purchase some workshop materials.</p><p>We could really use your help to get us there though! We'll also seek out funds from sponsors and do a little extra fundraising to cover the rest.</p><h3><strong>Be the hero in our story and help us with our quest to crowdfund $20,000! </strong></h3><p>These funds will go towards covering our biggest expenses first – paying artists and covering their material costs, and towards some food and lodging stipends for their stay in Port Hope.</p><p>If there's any more money in the 'treasure chest' after paying the artists we will put your monies to work! We will rent adequate sound equipment with your contributions for our Live D&amp;D Performance, pay some live musicians and troubadours to delight our festival goers' ears.  And we would rent large festival tents to provide shade and shelter for our community D&amp;D tournament (we can end up borrowing these things if needed, but time is also money and it takes a lot of muscle to set these things up, store them and transport them to and fro). </p><p>If there's even more money after we do all that... we will put it towards marketing and promotion of the festival beyond our social media networks and poster distribution, so we can share the experience with even more fans of D&amp;D and contemporary art.</p><p>If we exceed our wildest expectations of this crowdfunding campaign, and the festival pays for itself... we will direct any additional funds raised here to support future arts programming in our Little Station gallery and creative community hub. How amazing would that be?!<br/><br/>We also think you will really dig our rewards! We have some truly amazing, one-of-a-kind items and experiences up for grabs! </p><p><strong><u>Here's a breakdown of our workshops and festival costs</u>:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Workshop Series: ($3,000)</strong> Artist fees for 4 - 6 full-day workshops leading up to the festival.  Workshops will explore the visual arts spin-offs of D&amp;D and RPGs like life-drawing, zine making, costume design, character development, storytelling and world-building.</li>
<li>
<strong>Artist Fees &amp; Materials ($5,000)</strong> for our illustrators, writers and actors who will be documenting a live D&amp;D performance led by Ed Greenwood</li>
<li>

We will explore why role-playing games, especially Dungeons & Dragons (D&D), are currently having a pop culture moment and enjoying a resurgence into the mainstream and current zeitgeist.CRITICAL MASSIVE ADVENTURE is a summer series of artist-led workshops and an epic one-day festival of storytelling, performance, adventure and imagination through the lens of contemporary art. But... We need YOUR HELP to crowdfund $20,000 towards this Critical Massive Adventure!  The Impact of your supportWe believe that this festival will engage more youth, more members of the LGBTQ+ community, and will create inter-generational connections in our community, reflecting a sense of belonging and connection through collective storytelling.Role playing games offer a level playing field to explore emotions, concepts and scenarios through your 'character' in a low stakes, safe environment. They are an inclusive way for participants to connect as a community and feel a sense of confidence and belonging.  We want to be able to create this opportunity for our community. Watch what these D&D players have to say about why they love role playing games.
  More about CRITICAL MASSIVE ADVENTUREOur summer series of artist-led workshops will explore an intro to D&D and role play games, character and world building, escape room development, costume making, zine creation, and some fun D&D themed crafts for kids.At the festival, we have an epic day planned, including:

A Live Action D&D Performance in our charming small town bandshell - created by and featuring Ed Greenwood as the Dungeon Master!

Community D&D Tournament in the park
Artist Panel Discussions
RPG & D&D Demo Tables
Live Action Drawing & Zine Creation 
Cardboard Kingdom 
Cosplay Makers Zone
Escape Room / Dungeon

Art Exhibit of D&D Ephemera

Artist and Artisan Marketplace

Food, Music and more! ... and when the sun sets, continue the adventure with us on a...

  19+ Cosplay Pub Quest throughout downtown Port Hope!
For more info, visit the festival site: massiveadventure.criticalmassart.comOur ChallengeCritical Mass is a small volunteer run arts organization that does not receive operating funding.  We rely solely on small project grants, and sponsorship from local businesses to help cover the cost of expenses needed to run our programs and festivals. This year, we are feeling the pinch of cutbacks to these smaller grant streams. So, we also need the support from people like you to make our programs possible!We believe that artists should be paid a professional wage. We also believe that access to the arts should be accessible. So, we offer free or low cost participation in our programs &/or admission to our exhibits and special events.  We work hard to do this because we believe anyone should have the opportunity to participate in or experience the arts and its many benefits, including social inclusion, critical thinking, confidence building, creative problem solving, and health and mental wellness. In the past, Critical Mass has brought contemporary art experiences to public spaces, and has gained a reputation for doing 'big things' in our small town – pop up art events, installations, and festivals. We really want to keep up this goodwill and continue that momentum for community engagement this summer with a Critical Massive Adventure. We are a small and mighty team, but...We need YOU to be the HERO in our story! By supporting our campaign, you will help us pay artists, while also allowing us to offer free admission to the festival. Huzzah!  What we Need & What your support will FundTo run this epic one-day festival on a fairly lean budget, it would normally cost between $20,000 - $25,000. However, we have been crunching the numbers and we can get creative to make something magical happen for $10,000 - $15,000 if need be. That's enough to cover the costs to hire artists, musicians, sound technicians and purchase some workshop materials.We could really use your help to get us there though! We'll also seek out funds from sponsors and do a little extra fundraising to cover the rest.Be the hero in our story and help us with our quest to crowdfund $20,000! These funds will go towards covering our biggest expenses first – paying artists and covering their material costs, and towards some food and lodging stipends for their stay in Port Hope.If there's any more money in the 'treasure chest' after paying the artists we will put your monies to work! We will rent adequate sound equipment with your contributions for our Live D&D Performance, pay some live musicians and troubadours to delight our festival goers' ears.  And we would rent large festival tents to provide shade and shelter for our community D&D tournament (we can end up borrowing these things if needed, but time is also money and it takes a lot of muscle to set these things up, store them and transport them to and fro). If there's even more money after we do all that... we will put it towards marketing and promotion of the festival beyond our social media networks and poster distribution, so we can share the experience with even more fans of D&D and contemporary art.If we exceed our wildest expectations of this crowdfunding campaign, and the festival pays for itself... we will direct any additional funds raised here to support future arts programming in our Little Station gallery and creative community hub. How amazing would that be?!We also think you will really dig our rewards! We have some truly amazing, one-of-a-kind items and experiences up for grabs! Here's a breakdown of our workshops and festival costs:

Workshop Series: ($3,000) Artist fees for 4 - 6 full-day workshops leading up to the festival.  Workshops will explore the visual arts spin-offs of D&D and RPGs like life-drawing, zine making, costume design, character development, storytelling and world-building.

Artist Fees & Materials ($5,000) for our illustrators, writers and actors who will be documenting a live D&D performance led by Ed Greenwood

Onsite Artist Fees ($1,500) to sketch D&D characters, and to do some artisan demos and provide 'make and take' souvenirs at the festival 

Dungeon Masters Stipends ($1,000) Our community D&D tournament wouldn't be possible without our Dungeon Masters. We will be paying our DMs ($50/each) as a token of appreciation for all their game coordination and time.
Sound System/Equipment ($1,500)

Musicians (Live & DJ) ($2,500) for a DJ to create atmospheric soundtrack and to pay fees for a few roaming troubadours, a harpist, etc

Kids Activities ($1,500) cost to purchase supplies for our cardboard kingdom (facepainting, labyrnth and cosplay activities) and to hire Blades of Glory for some fun and educational medieval activities

Table & Chair Rentals ($1,500) for 20-30 x 96"" tables and up to 180 chairs

Marketing & Promotions ($4,000) for printing of signs/posters, t-shirts, and advertising

Volunteer Hospitality ($500-$1,000) Our festival wouldn't be the same without the support of our volunteers. We will ensure that we have enough, food, water, and sunscreen to keep our volunteers happy to spend their day with us.

If we don't reach our crowdfunding goal... We can scale back some of our ideas, and your money will go toward paying artist fees first and foremost for our live performance featuring Ed Greenwood. We will get super frugal and borrow as many tents, tables, chairs, and equipment as we can, etc.But... we would also need to charge an entrance fee to make up the difference.  However, we really don't want to do that.

Other Ways You Can Help If you can't contribute to our crowdfunding campaign right now, but still think this sounds super awesome, you can still help us by making some noise. Tell your friends about us and about our festival. Share this campaign with others who you think might also be able to help. We also hope you will come play with us. Join us at a workshop.  Round up some friends (or make new ones) and come to the festival on August 17th.

This event is meant to be a safe space for POC outdoor enthusiast and novice to celebrate and explore in one amazing weekend. Studies have shown getting outdoors and participating in recreational activities has positive impacts on physical, mental, and societal health.  However, it has to be done in a engaging and safe way. In a 2016 survey conducted by the National Park Service, it was found that less than 20% of park visitors were non-white. Due to numerous reasons including economic and safety issues, the outdoors can be intimidating in particular to POC. This festival will directly address these issues by bringing together people at all levels of outdoors engagement.</p>
<p><i>REFUGE IS ANYTHING TO WHICH ONE HAS RECOURSE FOR AID, RELIEF, OR ESCAPE.</i></p>
<p>With the capacity of 500, this will be our pilot festival with the intention to expand the concept to other areas around the country in the years to come. Let's be honest, I need MONEY, KNOWLEDGE, and RESOURCES. Planning a large-scale event outside isn't cheap, but together as a community we will make this event happen!</p>
<p><strong>YOUR FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTION </strong></p>
<p>Why do I need $10,000? What will it go to? The funds raised will go toward logistics and production costs to help keep the ticket price low. Every dollar counts. $10,000 is only a fraction of what the overall event will cost but it will go toward venue rental and deposits fees for items like restrooms and transportation. </p>
<p><strong>YOUR IMPACT</strong></p>
<p>I'm sure you've seen the news so I don't have to tell you about all the negative things that have been going on in the world and the attacks on POC communities. This event is needed now more than ever. I believe the festival will be a life changing moment for many people. </p>
<p>1. Simply put representation matters. All people face hurdles in accessing the outdoors. Many POCs have added challenges such as access to gear, transportation to wild spaces, and the lack of outdoor knowledge this festival has been developed to address issues. </p>
<p>2. Life is hard and we all need opportunities to have real conversations. 80% of Americans believe it’s essential for people to come together in person to promote positive change. </p>
<p>3. This is not a one-off event it is to build community and connect people with resources for ongoing engagement. </p>
<p>Your contribution will not only help create this space space but will also help close the adventure gap and impact communities for a better tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</strong></p>
<p>Did I mention this isn't my first event? My passion for events and the outdoors has lead me on this path and I believe it will be the community that I have built over the years that will push me through. On hard days I recall my experience in Vermont (What experience in VT? Watch the video) and I work harder to ensure this festival is a success. This event will happen rain or shine.</p>
<p><strong>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</strong></p>
<p>Remember I mentioned Knowledge and Resources? I understand that not everyone will be able to contribute financially (but if you can please do) here are other opportunities:</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Escritoriqueño project is an attempt, by a small group of Outer-Rican writers, teachers and entrepreneurs, to give our young Puerto Rican children an opportunity to be heard, felt and understood through the medium of writing. It is an attempt to help a generation of young Puerto Ricans heal from the devastation of Hurricane Maria.  </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Hurricane Maria affected every single kid in Puerto Rico, the entire population of kids...DIRECTLY! The goal of this project is simple: to gather a group of Puerto Rican kids and their parents together in order to facilitate a process that encourages the kids in the group to share their experience, strength and hope…before, during and after Maria. The documented and published true stories that these kids tell will begin a healing process for the writers and the readers alike.</p>

<h3><strong>Short Summary</strong></h3>
<p>The Italian Cultural Center “Marco Polo” offers Italian classes to children ages 2 to 11 in Roxborough, Philadelphia at the Kendrick Recreation Center. The school started in 2000 as a need of Italian families in the Greater Philadelphia Area. Classes meet two hours a week and cover Italian language and grammar, as well as Geography, Music, History, and Visual Arts, We also organize several events for our families to enhance the understanding and knowledge of Italian language, culture and tradition.</p>
<p>So far we have been guests at the Kendrick Recreation Center, a City of Philadelphia community building. Since 2000 we have been delivering classes only on Saturdays from October to May. However, the classroom is not in good shape to host all students, especially our young kids (2-3 yr old). Also, we are not in condition to fully enhance our possibilities in this venue and we have to keep our class materials in different places. Our teachers are engaged, dedicated, and enthusiastic, so that our kids really find a good reason to practice Italian as second language. We are striving to create a community in which every learner is accepted and has an active role. Our parents always join our extra-curricular activities and are engaged in our small community.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your generosity. Please feel free to contact us with any questions via email at scuolamarcopolo.phila@gmail.com.</p>

<p>If we don't reach our entire goal, we will deposit this amount in a restricted fund to be used for a down payment, and the rest will be financed through a bank loan.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Scuola Marco Polo's goal is to educate students and families on the importance of bilingual education and Italian Culture.</p>
<p>Scuola Marco Polo believes that Italian language, traditions, music and culture are essential tools to create a unified community. We are happy to celebrate Italian and American festivities with families of diverse background and culture.</p>
<p>Bilingual education provides cognitive advantages:</p>
<p>- Developing a very active and flexible brain <br/>- Developing more flexible approaches because of the ability to switch between languages<br/>- Developing ability to ignore irrelevant information <br/>- Focusing, remembering, and making decisions</p>
<p>and social-emotional advantages:</p>
<p>- Maintain strong ties with their entire family, culture, and community: social identity <br/>- Make new friends and create strong relationships in their second language: social diversity<br/>- Children show better self-control </p>
<p>Other scientifically proven benefits of bilingualism are:</p>
<p>- Bilingualism may delay the onset of Alzheimer’s disease<br/>- Bilingual adults have more job opportunities around the world than monolingual adults <br/>- Bilingual employees earn an average of $7,000 more per year than their monolingual peers<br/>- Bilingual citizens are active members of the global community, due to their multi-language knowledge  <br/>- Bilingualism frees people from biases and limited thinking</p>

<h3>Duluth Færing Project Summary</h3>
<p>Here's what we're up to:</p>
<ul>
<li>John Finkle is the<strong> Duluth Færing Project's</strong> shipwright. He has built numerous wooden boats and has many, many years of experience teaching hand-tool woodworking. Several months ago he traveled to Norway to research historical and contemporary wooden boat building methods in the millennia-old Norwegian tradition. John, along with Justin Anderson (the project's volunteer media director) and a growing number of community members comprise the newly-formed <strong><i>Nóatún Community Wooden Boat Works</i></strong>. ""Nóatún"" (pronounced ""noah-toon"") means ""boat enclosure"" or ""boat home"" in Old Norse; it is the home of the Norse God <strong><i>Njord </i></strong>who oversees safe waters, sunny shores, small watercraft and their crews.</li>
<li>With Duluth community members, we are building a traditional lap-strake, clinker-built, Scandinavian <i><strong>færing</strong></i> approximately 19 feet long using hand tools and locally sourced materials. The frame will be hand-hewn from locally harvested Burr Oak (a magnificent tree which we have established great affection for) and the strakes of milled Cedar. This is an uncommon and disappearing art that is being passionately revived around the world one boat at a time; we want to do our part in bringing this tradition back to life in a contemporary context and to share it with our local community and the broader Lake Superior region.</li>
<li>Contributions to this fundraising campaign will allow us to continue to rent our shop space (and afford building/liability insurance) in the heart of downtown Duluth, where the project is highly visible and accessible to the public; further, with your support, we will be able to secure the continuation of our project and the construction of a SECOND færing later this year! We hope to have the boat finished for a community launching and celebration event and begin the vessels life on the waters of the Great Lakes–powered by oar and sail.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>This is a passion project for us and as such we're volunteering our time and labor (don't get us wrong, we're having plenty of fun too), so your donations will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Affording newly negotiated rent and other costs of maintaining the shop space</li>
<li>Miscellaneous supplies and materials that we are unable to naturally harvest, collect, or obtain as donations</li>
<li>We've got the wood, we've got the tools, we've got the hardware, we've got skilled workers and community volunteers alike; right now, we really just need help staying put in our lovely space at its new and improved cost!</li>
<li>If we fall short or exceed or fundraising goals at this point in time, the funds will still be put to the above uses and we will continue the effort as best we can!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This craft will move people through our native waters by oar and sail.</p>
<ul>
<li>We passionately want a community FLEET of wooden boats for Lake Superior moored in Duluth, Minnesota; with your help, this is very achievable!</li>
<li>People observing or participating hands-on will see and learn the satisfaction and beautiful quiet and slow deliberateness of using timeless tools in the act of creating.</li>
<li>It will be very satisfying for people to use simple planes and saws to sculpt wood and create a highly useful, “living,” functional work of art–and be able to take pride in something they had a direct hand in helping to create.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>There are many, many ways for you to contribute:</p>
<ul>
<li>Come and visit the boat shop! Swing an axe; peen a copper nail; plane a plank; say hello!</li>
<li>Please use Indiegogo's SHARE tools to help spread the word, thank you!</li>

</div></div>","The Amedeo Modigliani Institute, an Italian Foundation based in Rome, intends to pursue its mission of promoting the life and art of Modigliani by carrying out an extraordinary exhibition that has never been attempted before, and as it continues to grow, will see all 337 works of the Master represented by 2020, the centennial celebration of Modigliani's death. An unforgettable exhibition, aimed at showcasing Modigliani's entire art production, made possible by special backlit reproductions (called Modlight®) that we have created with the most advanced technologies, with respect to the original size and color and authorized by the rightful owners. All held by the Institute are equipped with fascinating historical evidence consisting of documents, photos, and relics of the time.It is precisely for the production of Modlights® that we are asking for your help. We believe, in fact, that Modlights® and the technology behind them are the ideal tool to dramatically reduce the cost of exhibitions while preserving the necessary cultural and informational accuracy, thus bringing art to the people at the greatest meeting points, squares, university campuses, cafés, theater foyers, and malls. A true revolution that has already begun and was experimented with in Italy in 2015, which will make art more accessible to everyone, so that they can experience the unmistakable emotions it can generate, regardless of the traditional cultural tastes that are sometimes reluctant to innovation and incapable of interpreting modern ways of learning.Every penny that you donate will, thus, be employed to create a Modlight artwork®, which will immediately be added to the 53 already existing ones that are part of the exhibitions already completed or underway, with the aim of reaching a total production of 337 certified works attributed to Amedeo Modigliani as soon as possible.
Help us to give light to art, build a Modlight® with us!

<h2>What is Casita Esperanza?</h2>
<p>Casita Esperanza is an all-encompassing project; we strive to respond to the new challenges posed by the humanitarian crisis stemming from an inadequate governmental response to the disaster. The inefficiency of the official disaster response team, paired with the amount of destruction, has forced grassroots initiatives to step up and take a more important role in reconstruction and relief efforts, increasing the need for volunteer work.</p>
<h3>We strive to facilitate the volunteering process.</h3>
<p>That means receiving travelers in a place tailor made to fit their needs and coordinating with our partners to place them where their skills would be needed. We plan to equip them with the tools (machetes, chainsaws, gloves, etc.) that would allow them to be useful on site. In addition, we would provide transportation to and from volunteering sites, as well as to-go meals.</p>
<h3>We are committed to making a self-sustainable space.</h3>
<p>We would like to use the 775 square foot terrace of Casita Esperanza as a “huerto,” food garden. Through a rain collecting system, paired with a reverse osmosis water filtration, we’ll be able to collect water for the garden and provide drinkable water. Following an agro ecologic line, our garden is free of chemicals and able to produce diverse fruits and vegetables toward the consumption of our visitors. Finally, we wish to run on solar energy, severing the ties with inefficient and obsolete Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority.</p>
<h3>We provide a space for our network.</h3>
<p>We would like to provide our network of small organizations with not only volunteers but also a space to stay in Casita Esperanza and enjoy its ammenities when traveling to the metro area. The terrace would also be available for our network to host educational workshops and events.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Although Casita Esperanza is a fairly new project, it is past the theoretical stage.</h3>
<p>We have the physical space, located in Punta Las Marias, Santurce. We have a website under construction and have started establishing relationships with international volunteers as well as the different local organizations. We are confident that this project has great potential, and we are looking forward to the support of our contributors to help us bring it to fruition.</p>

<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>Casita Esperanza stems from the collaboration between two friends, who moved to Puerto Rico, respectively, from France and from Texas, and decided to join forces in the wake of the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Having worked and lived on the island for several years, we’ve developed strong ties to the community and are happy to call Puerto Rico our home.</p>
<p>The strength of this project comes from our diverse and complementary backgrounds. One of us is experienced in interior displays and was an integral part of the successful opening of Nordstrom on the island; while the other created and runs Sin Mirar Pa’l La’O (SMPL), a community based non-profit.</p>
<p>After the passage of Hurricane Maria, circumstances presented us with a dilemma. We could choose to leave to pursue opportunities outside of Puerto Rico, or to stay and try and make a positive impact. We easily settled on the latter, and this is how Casita Esperanza was born.</p>

<h2>Where will your contributions go?</h2>

I was born in Bluefields, Nicaragua and lived in the United States of America for over 15 years. Shortly after returning from the United States Marine Corps I returned to Bluefields, and what was supposed to be a 3 months trip to plant the seeds for a couple projects with a non-profit corporation I founded named “One Earth-One People-One Love Inc. (1EPL, Inc.) in the state of Georgia. Now I've been in Bluefields for 3 years, and each day since I came back, I’ve been learning more than I ever had. I came to know of the richness and uniqueness of our cultural heritage like never before, such as our Ethnic diversity, our traditional musical composition, and other artistic expressions that could have a major impact in our society.</p><p>In 2005, two young motivated Americans by the names of Edwin Reed and Alexander Scott, began promoting young talents and local artist from a generation that is being left in a distant memory for most, talents that were undervalued for decades. They managed to raise funds for their cause and were able to move our communities in ways they haven’t moved for nearly 30 years; Musical albums were produced,  archiving new and authentic content from artists like “papa Bantam, Kaliboom, Mango Ghost, Sabu the Catty man,” among others. Unfortunately, the Bluefields Sound System’s grand presentation began to fade as Edwin and Alexander began to face the difficulties of the challenges in sustainable cultural promotion on this region of the world; funds ran low, and financial difficulties forced them to go seeking for a space to relocate the studio. In attempt to execute a project in collaboration with the regional government, in 2012 the regional government of the South Autonomous Caribbean Coast or Nicaragua granted them a space in a building that was funded to have a community space, in which the only operation was a government owned radio station. They allowed BSS to work under our own bureaucracy, while respecting a basic operation schedule, and so the studio began producing once again, but this time it was more accessible for the general community, and not just selected local artists.</p><p>The project with the regional government suddenly discontinued due to unknown reasons, and within a year the only fully capacitated producer and musician had to leave in search for a better opportunity, so once again the studio faced the threat of closing. By this time Edwin had left and Alex was about to leave to study for his master’s degree, leaving a few motivated artists with no administrative knowledge to continue the operation of the studio. This is the point at which I began to volunteer at the Bluefields Sound System Studio. Shortly after I began, the challenges rose again, as members of the regional government began to make attempts to take over our equipment, and so force us to close our doors. we fought a two-year battle while serving our communities as an accessible resource that otherwise was not available in our region. We became part of the violence prevention committee in our region, we worked hand in hand with the regional youth secretary using information communication technology to promoted cultural awareness by executing projects that educated society of the richness and value of our cultural heritage, and the importance to advocate for a cleaner, safer, and more productive culture of peace. Unfortunately, we were forced to find another location, because government officials needed another office space. As a result, we were facing the threat of losing a couple of the computers that we have been using for over 5 years, which are among our most valuable resource to do our work. </p><p>We managed to rent a suitable space that met the conditions for us to operate again as a community recording studio and multimedia center. Unfortunately, we were economically crippled by relocating. Our overhead cost for rent are more than we are able to generate having a limited staff that works on a volunteer basis. Over the past three years we have been designed a project based on our organization's operational model, of which with your support we can begin full operation of the project Caribbean Culture Center for Arts &amp; Music by the end February of 2017. </p><p> </p><p>the following videos are samples among many other kinds of products that we will be producing...</p><div>

</div><div> </div><p><strong>· Why this initiative is important for me</strong></p><p>Culture is the arts and other manifestations of human intellectual achievement regarded collectively. Culture can be viewed as characteristics and knowledge of a particular group of people, defined by everything from language, religion, cuisine, social habits, music and arts, and when those aspects of culture are being lost an inevitable unbalance occurs that cause changes that may alter land, customs, and even the people them selves will have to adapt and eventually lose valuable aspects of that culture. When the culture of a people has been the mechanism of survival for thousands of years, it is imperative . Therefor to promote a sustainable culture of peace, it is imperative to rescue and preserve those aspects of culture that are being lost in our region.</p><p> </p><p>Music is an expressive art of a cultural identity of our people, the lack of infrastructure and resource has limited the practice of that art for over 3 decades, slowly disappearing that unique identity.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/ep1kAT3Mj5k?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><div> </div><p>Operating as a Community Recording Studio &amp; Multimedia Center, Bluefields Sound System is the first Community Center of it’s kind. We have been a resource for society since 2005. Our works are mainly in the areas of Communication, Culture, and Youth. We are here to rescue and preserve those cultural values...</p><p>The Bluefields Sound System's Caribbean Cultural Center for Arts and Music project is a participatory development initiative aimed at providing Technology, Communication, Media production training, Arts &amp; Music as an innovative and sustainable solution for capacity building of cultural tourism in isolated and economically disadvantaged indigenous and Afro-descendent communities. </p><p> </p><p><strong>What your contribution will help achieve:</strong></p><p>On the Autonomous regions of Nicaragua there is an immense fountain of natural resources, including talented artistic youths. Your contribution will help the Bluefields Sound System community recording studio and multimedia center to successfully execute the CCCAM initiatives for a year period, which will directly employ 5 skilled and talented member of our society, at least 20 people will be employed through commission based collaboration, and over a hundred youths will be trained on how to promote their skills and talent in their corresponding market within the first 3 months. Your contributions will help promote the sustainable development of our communities; by securing a staff for a year, BSS will launch the CCCAM initiative at its capacity and within a year we will have the CCCAM initiative replicated and put into operation in collaboration with communal leaders in 5 different communities in our region, creating means for job opportunities and rescuing and preserving our cultural heritage.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZltuQRMZllE?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><div> </div><div> </div><p><strong>Contributions will help activate all four components of the project:</strong></p><p> </p><p><i><strong>BSS Community Recording Studio</strong></i> <i>(the only recording studio of it's kind):</i></p><p>This is a community recording studio where members of our society have access to acquire new skills and develop new talent, and exercise their abilities while learning valuable life-skills through music writing, composition, and overall expressions.</p><p>It’s open for inspired artist and professional artist alike, and it’s equipped with all necessary tools to compose, produce, and promote their music.</p><p><i><strong>The Bluefields School of Music</strong></i> <i>(Caribbean cultural music school):</i></p><p>This is where we will provide traditional and non-traditional instrument and vocal lessons. Most of the historical education of our musical expressions will be taught here. Music teachers will be the last living legendaries of our traditional music. </p><p><i><strong>SunRise Drama Club (SunRise DC):</strong></i></p><p>This is first drama/acting program of it's kind in over 30 years.</p><p>Participants will learn the art of drama and acting, and how to implement those skills to performing arts and cultural expression.</p><p><i><strong>Innovative Tech-Center (ITC):    </strong>                                                        </i>                                                                                    This is a Multimedia computer lab where participants will have access to ICT workshops, computer courses, marketing workshops, language learning courses, audio &amp; video production courses, and access to global information of technology.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p><p>We need to raise funds to continue renting the space where we have rebuilt our studio and have began executing our programs and services to provide a financial support (honorarium) for our volunteers in the administrative and operational structure, funds to implement projects designed and ready for execution, and to refurbish or purchase equipment to successfully execute the Caribbean Culture Center for Arts &amp; Music project. </p><p>As a result of your contribution, we will assure to keep you updated throughout the year by providing you with a free registration to our newsletter, keeping our facebook page updated daily, we will send you postcards signed by local artists most recognized, we will provide access to free download codes to download our latest productions, and also we will dedicate activities and  initiatives to donors among other perks. </p><p>If we reach our goal, we will fully operate as a caribbean Cultural Center for Arts &amp; Music; of which will have direct presence in 5 communities on the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua.</p><p> </p><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p><p>In economically disadvantaged communities across the globe, it is difficult or nearly impossible to gain access to resources that may simplify or simply give a chance to community members to augment the efforts to better the conditions in their communities. Bluefields Sound System, through the CCCAM initiatives is making available the resources that help community members of the South Autonomous Region of Nicaragua to market their artistic resources.  Music is transcendent, and the messages in music can influence emotional states and behavior, and as local artist get a fear chance to project their music to the world, it may be the song of one of them that touches you in a moment most necessary. The musical composition in our region is more than just music, it's the only way in which we record our history, because in our music, we tell current events and talk about people or places most influential in our communities. Having the studio's doors open is as having a system that will archive our history. Because we teach multimedia production, we have the initiative to begin producing the first visual productions in our region by people of our region. We will be countering most negative influence brought in through media, with positive influence from our reality.</p><p>In the past we have executed many projects, one of our most successful  project was the production of an album from the Bluefields school of Music, which was a byproduct of the first music school of it's kind in Bluefields since more than 30 years ago. The album featured legendary artist from the 70’s and 80’s and young artist of this generation in attempt to bridge a connection that can rescue our traditional music with this generation. We fundraised to print the album on Kickstarter and were funded more than 100% of our goal for that project.</p><p>Another one of our success have been in the late 2014… May of 2014, we hosted an initiative that promoted a cultural exchange between a reggae band from the New Mexico and our local Maypole Music. The project was executed in the form of a competition between young artist of the coast, whom had to compose new verses to accompany the chorus of our traditional maypole music from the 70’s as an attempt to once again bridge that generational gap in our traditional musical composition. The top 3 winners of the competition were granted the opportunity to participate in 3 concerts in three isolated communities on the South Autonomous region of Nicaragua, accompanied by the reggae band Reviva. A CD album was also produced from this event, the album contained the songs of all the participating local artist. The impact of this event is still resounding on the streets of Bluefields today as community members pass you by with their event shirt on and as the music is played on the radios in the month of celebration every may. By the end of our first year we will have developed a community network between islated indigenous and Afro-descendants in the South Autonomous Region of the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua Nicaragua</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/BY-fxm1JC-g?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><div><i>This video was made by one of SIT study abroad student visit to the Bluefields Sound System Studios in early 2016.

We sustained ourselves providing professional services in the areas that we were teaching. unfortunately that was not a steady stream of income to maintain a full staff to operate according to our full capacity, and that have been our greatest challenge in the past.

They allowed BSS to work under our own bureaucracy, while respecting a basic operation schedule, and so the studio began producing once again, but this time it was more accessible for the general community, and not just selected local artists.The project with the regional government suddenly discontinued due to unknown reasons, and within a year the only fully capacitated producer and musician had to leave in search for a better opportunity, so once again the studio faced the threat of closing. By this time Edwin had left and Alex was about to leave to study for his master’s degree, leaving a few motivated artists with no administrative knowledge to continue the operation of the studio. This is the point at which I began to volunteer at the Bluefields Sound System Studio. Shortly after I began, the challenges rose again, as members of the regional government began to make attempts to take over our equipment, and so force us to close our doors. we fought a two-year battle while serving our communities as an accessible resource that otherwise was not available in our region. We became part of the violence prevention committee in our region, we worked hand in hand with the regional youth secretary using information communication technology to promoted cultural awareness by executing projects that educated society of the richness and value of our cultural heritage, and the importance to advocate for a cleaner, safer, and more productive culture of peace. Unfortunately, we were forced to find another location, because government officials needed another office space. As a result, we were facing the threat of losing a couple of the computers that we have been using for over 5 years, which are among our most valuable resource to do our work. We managed to rent a suitable space that met the conditions for us to operate again as a community recording studio and multimedia center. Unfortunately, we were economically crippled by relocating. Our overhead cost for rent are more than we are able to generate having a limited staff that works on a volunteer basis. Over the past three years we have been designed a project based on our organization's operational model, of which with your support we can begin full operation of the project Caribbean Culture Center for Arts & Music by the end February of 2017.  the following videos are samples among many other kinds of products that we will be producing...
 

 
 
 · Why this initiative is important for meCulture is the arts and other manifestations of human intellectual achievement regarded collectively. Culture can be viewed as characteristics and knowledge of a particular group of people, defined by everything from language, religion, cuisine, social habits, music and arts, and when those aspects of culture are being lost an inevitable unbalance occurs that cause changes that may alter land, customs, and even the people them selves will have to adapt and eventually lose valuable aspects of that culture. When the culture of a people has been the mechanism of survival for thousands of years, it is imperative . Therefor to promote a sustainable culture of peace, it is imperative to rescue and preserve those aspects of culture that are being lost in our region. Music is an expressive art of a cultural identity of our people, the lack of infrastructure and resource has limited the practice of that art for over 3 decades, slowly disappearing that unique identity. Operating as a Community Recording Studio & Multimedia Center, Bluefields Sound System is the first Community Center of it’s kind. We have been a resource for society since 2005. Our works are mainly in the areas of Communication, Culture, and Youth. We are here to rescue and preserve those cultural values...The Bluefields Sound System's Caribbean Cultural Center for Arts and Music project is a participatory development initiative aimed at providing Technology, Communication, Media production training, Arts & Music as an innovative and sustainable solution for capacity building of cultural tourism in isolated and economically disadvantaged indigenous and Afro-descendent communities.  What your contribution will help achieve:On the Autonomous regions of Nicaragua there is an immense fountain of natural resources, including talented artistic youths. Your contribution will help the Bluefields Sound System community recording studio and multimedia center to successfully execute the CCCAM initiatives for a year period, which will directly employ 5 skilled and talented member of our society, at least 20 people will be employed through commission based collaboration, and over a hundred youths will be trained on how to promote their skills and talent in their corresponding market within the first 3 months. Your contributions will help promote the sustainable development of our communities; by securing a staff for a year, BSS will launch the CCCAM initiative at its capacity and within a year we will have the CCCAM initiative replicated and put into operation in collaboration with communal leaders in 5 different communities in our region, creating means for job opportunities and rescuing and preserving our cultural heritage.  Contributions will help activate all four components of the project: BSS Community Recording Studio (the only recording studio of it's kind):This is a community recording studio where members of our society have access to acquire new skills and develop new talent, and exercise their abilities while learning valuable life-skills through music writing, composition, and overall expressions.It’s open for inspired artist and professional artist alike, and it’s equipped with all necessary tools to compose, produce, and promote their music.The Bluefields School of Music (Caribbean cultural music school):This is where we will provide traditional and non-traditional instrument and vocal lessons. Most of the historical education of our musical expressions will be taught here. Music teachers will be the last living legendaries of our traditional music. SunRise Drama Club (SunRise DC):This is first drama/acting program of it's kind in over 30 years.Participants will learn the art of drama and acting, and how to implement those skills to performing arts and cultural expression.Innovative Tech-Center (ITC):                                                                                                                                                This is a Multimedia computer lab where participants will have access to ICT workshops, computer courses, marketing workshops, language learning courses, audio & video production courses, and access to global information of technology. What We Need & What You GetWe need to raise funds to continue renting the space where we have rebuilt our studio and have began executing our programs and services to provide a financial support (honorarium) for our volunteers in the administrative and operational structure, funds to implement projects designed and ready for execution, and to refurbish or purchase equipment to successfully execute the Caribbean Culture Center for Arts & Music project. As a result of your contribution, we will assure to keep you updated throughout the year by providing you with a free registration to our newsletter, keeping our facebook page updated daily, we will send you postcards signed by local artists most recognized, we will provide access to free download codes to download our latest productions, and also we will dedicate activities and  initiatives to donors among other perks. If we reach our goal, we will fully operate as a caribbean Cultural Center for Arts & Music; of which will have direct presence in 5 communities on the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua. The ImpactIn economically disadvantaged communities across the globe, it is difficult or nearly impossible to gain access to resources that may simplify or simply give a chance to community members to augment the efforts to better the conditions in their communities. Bluefields Sound System, through the CCCAM initiatives is making available the resources that help community members of the South Autonomous Region of Nicaragua to market their artistic resources.  Music is transcendent, and the messages in music can influence emotional states and behavior, and as local artist get a fear chance to project their music to the world, it may be the song of one of them that touches you in a moment most necessary. The musical composition in our region is more than just music, it's the only way in which we record our history, because in our music, we tell current events and talk about people or places most influential in our communities. Having the studio's doors open is as having a system that will archive our history. Because we teach multimedia production, we have the initiative to begin producing the first visual productions in our region by people of our region. We will be countering most negative influence brought in through media, with positive influence from our reality.In the past we have executed many projects, one of our most successful  project was the production of an album from the Bluefields school of Music, which was a byproduct of the first music school of it's kind in Bluefields since more than 30 years ago. The album featured legendary artist from the 70’s and 80’s and young artist of this generation in attempt to bridge a connection that can rescue our traditional music with this generation. We fundraised to print the album on Kickstarter and were funded more than 100% of our goal for that project.Another one of our success have been in the late 2014… May of 2014, we hosted an initiative that promoted a cultural exchange between a reggae band from the New Mexico and our local Maypole Music. The project was executed in the form of a competition between young artist of the coast, whom had to compose new verses to accompany the chorus of our traditional maypole music from the 70’s as an attempt to once again bridge that generational gap in our traditional musical composition. The top 3 winners of the competition were granted the opportunity to participate in 3 concerts in three isolated communities on the South Autonomous region of Nicaragua, accompanied by the reggae band Reviva. A CD album was also produced from this event, the album contained the songs of all the participating local artist. The impact of this event is still resounding on the streets of Bluefields today as community members pass you by with their event shirt on and as the music is played on the radios in the month of celebration every may. By the end of our first year we will have developed a community network between islated indigenous and Afro-descendants in the South Autonomous Region of the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua NicaraguaThis video was made by one of SIT study abroad student visit to the Bluefields Sound System Studios in early 2016. The only inaccurate  Risks & ChallengesWe have been faced with many challenges, but we never gave up, and we will never give up. Our organization worked on ""zero"" funding for years. All of our teem members are volunteers working for a cause. We sustained ourselves providing professional services in the areas that we were teaching. unfortunately that was not a steady stream of income to maintain a full staff to operate according to our full capacity, and that have been our greatest challenge in the past. Especially since the government had limited us to a work schedule that only allowed us to provide free community service, leaving us with no time for our sustainability model to be executed. If we were to reach our goal in this fund raiser, the main challenge we will face is the fact that we will be limited to the number of communities in which we will have a presence during the first year. There is a high demand for our presence in all of our communities, unfortunately there is hardly any support and when available, it's minimal, but they are willing to work with us once we have the financial support to back up our projects.   The Rhythm of Our Culture short documentary Other Ways You Can HelpJust by reading this information you have contributed, because this organization is a social work most needed in our communities and across the globe.

<p>A Message From DJ Stormin Norman:</p>
<p>I love playing music for people. I love playing music that makes people dance. I love playing music that makes people dance and has people come together. This is why I’ve been a DJ for the people for 30 years. My heart is with the people that make up my beloved community of Harlem. That’s why 11 years ago I created Sundae Sermon. I wanted the people of my community to have a free, family-friendly outdoor party and picnic where they felt free to dance, picnic, play, laugh, come out and connect with each other. All with a backdrop of good music that makes us happy while keeping us healthy.</p>
<p>The people came, first by the hundreds, then by the thousands. The people came, with their children, parents, partners and friends. They came with their blankets and BBQ.</p>
<p>It was beautifully fulfilling to see thousands of people from all over gathered and having free fun, but then came the obstacles. I've been working relentlessly to overcome the lofty and costly problems associated with trying to maintain and protect “Good Music For Good People”. This should continue to be a gift for the good people and take place in  parks within the village of Harlem. </p>
<p>I was downtrodden and discouraged. What lifted and fueled me was the <i>peoples cry . </i>Reading newspaper articles asking ""What happened to Sundae Sermon?"" The constant emails from all over the world and the disappointment on the faces of the parishioners who asked ""Why weren't there any Sundae Sermon in 2016? What can I/we do? We need Sundae Sermon!""  This reminded me of why I created it and gave me a renewed energy.  It was hurtful not having the answers, it was a really hard time for me. I missed my people.  I made a declaration that amidst the times we are living through LOVE is STRONGER! The People of Harlem are Strong! #harlemstrong SUNDAE SERMON IS BACK .  </p>

<p>My name is Benjamin Mathes, I was inspired to create Urban Confessional because I experienced the healing power of LISTENING in my own life. I felt compelled to share it with as many people as possible.</p>
<p>One day I was walking down the street and a homeless man asked for money. I turned to him and offered to LISTEN instead. I saw how the simple act of listening was not only a gift to him but a gift to me, in that moment we were both restored. A few days later along with a group of friends, we decided to walk over to a nearby train station and hold up signs that read FREE LISTENING. We stood there and just LISTENED, truly LISTENED to strangers tell us whatever they wanted to tell us. It was a judgment-free zone, the experience was magical and that's how URBAN CONFESSIONAL was born.</p>

Here's the story of Kawon:In the beginning of 2016, the idea of Kawon was born. The fledgling idea emerged from the heart of the community for the need of change in our society, to make people more familiar with the benefit of reading through self–learning methods and social activities.Kawon started as self-funded project. After facing financial stress, Kawon launched a social street initiative called “Books On the Road” to help fund the project in Madaba, Jordan.Books on the Road involves displaying books on a 1974 Mercedes 200 called ""Nancy."" Making a unique signature on people passing by, Books On the Road has gained local and international interests and has became one of Amman’s main attractions. We have finally opened our bookshop in Madaba and have been operating since December 2, 2016.Learn more about Books on the Road and me at Stories of Our City. **The Project**             Kawon is a socially-active bookstore, a cultural space for youth in Madaba, Jordan, with a friendly environment that encourages reading culture through social engagement activities. Our mission: To spread reading culture through an interactive approach by committing to engage with the many diverse people and organizations of our community and to provide good quality books of all types at affordable prices. Additionally, we strive to provide a hospitable and nurturing environment to encourage the healthy exchange of ideas.Our vision: Nurturing the life of the mind through our products, services, and experiences.

<p>“It’s always heartening to see young people be the bridge, whether they are from the US or from South Africa. It was my dad that said the youth are our future. We have to make sure the youth are properly educated and trained. And it is through education and exposure to other people, through sharing that we learn and we better understand ourselves.”</p>
<p>-Dr. Makaziwe Mandela</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Being in this program actually helped cultivate what I wanted to do. I knew engineering was something that I always planned. But, being in Africa and working with these students and really being exposed to STEM and all the technological things that they did. It really helped me see that I wanted to do this for a career.”</p>
<p>-Djeder Basu, student at UMBC College of Engineering</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Swaliga is on the cutting edge of a culturally responsible social innovation that clearly activates intrinsic motivation in students and positions them in the pipeline of emerging global citizens”</p>
<p>- Kwabena Boateng, Chair of the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Africa Homecoming</p>
<h2>Background: The Challenge and Opportunity</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560271030/ctjyp9bvefctiiqughvb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Since 2012, the Swaliga Foundation has been providing STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math) education through after-school programs, cultural exchange programs, and original online content to its youth in Washington, D.C. Over the years, we have identified three important trends in STEAM and education:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Lack of diversity in STEAM fields.</strong> This exam by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) also reports that<a href=""https://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisa-2015-results-in-focus.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> “disadvantaged students remain significantly less likely than their advantaged peers to see themselves pursuing a career in [STEM].”</a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Opportunities for STEAM jobs rising.</strong> Careers in these STEAM fields are projected to account for 70% of job growth by the year 2020 totaling over a million new jobs (National Science Foundation).</li>
<li>
<strong>Diversity in STEAM signals huge benefits to tech innovation.</strong> <a href=""https://www.wired.com/brandlab/2015/05/5-numbers-explain-stem-diversity-matters-us/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Diversity matters</a>.  More and more we are understanding why. For example, according to a University of Maryland and Columbia Business School joint study, gender diversity at the management level leads to a $42 million increase in value of S&amp;P 500 firms.</li>
</ul>
<p>So how do we improve diversity in STEAM? Over the past seven years, we found our most successful program helps solve this question. We call this program #STEAMtheBlock.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Meet #STEAMtheBlock</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560271064/ez1rto9qqfp1x7jcyylw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>#STEAMtheBlock uses digital art as a bridge to teach Engineering Design and Applied Science. Since 2012 Swaliga Foundation has worked with more than 8,000 youth from the lowest income communities in the DC metro region proving afterschool programming, cultural exchange programs and community workshops at little or no cost to families. In a recent workshop series at McKinley Tech Middle School in Washington, D.C., provided through a grant award from the DC Commission on the Arts &amp; Humanities, Swaliga’s #STEAMtheBlock curriculum resulted in an 87% increase in comprehension in Engineering and Science concepts.</p>
<p>Swaliga’s #STEAMtheBlock program focuses on three main goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase student efficacy in STEAM</li>
<li>Boost youth engagement in STEAM through digital arts</li>
<li>Build awareness of STEAM related fields</li>
</ul>
<p>Swaliga uses the arts during STEM instruction in ways that are not seen in traditional school settings. Through creativity and music, students actively engage in learning STEM regardless of learning styles, background or socioeconomic status. The ultimate reward for students who successfully complete the #STEAMtheBlock program is to travel with Swaliga during the STEAM Cultural Exchange, which brings us to why we are here at Indiegogo!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Experience of a Lifetime: The #STEAMtheBlock Cultural Exchange Trip</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560271129/tkc8mkwx8bsxdvwegk46.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i><strong>Our goal is to raise funds to host 7 South African students in our hometown of Washington, D.C.</strong></i></p>
<p>#STEAMtheBlock culminates in the #STEAMtheBlock Cultural Exchange trip at the end of the school year. Launched in 2016, the trip has sent students and educators from the United States to South Africa to engage with their peers in cultural dialogue and interactive STEAM educational workshops. This week-long international youth summit consists of more than 35 hours of educational programming, as well as a community service project.</p>
<p>2019 will be the first year that our cultural exchange will take place in Washington, DC. In this week-long international youth summit rooted in STEAM, Health &amp; Wellness, and Entrepreneurship &amp; Leadership, seven South African students will join their peers from Washington D.C. and Houston to visit universities, attend workshops and panel discussions, and spend time together enjoying the arts and culture of DC. In total, about 30 exchange students will be participating.</p>
<p>Our community service project will be aimed directly at youth homelessness in Washington, D.C. As with every year, the exchange will culminate in our 4th annual #STEAMtheBlock party on July 27, 2019.</p>

<h2>What Have We Done So Far?</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560271363/epgv1ypuawax4cvjxas4.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Since 2016, the Swaliga Foundation has hosted three consecutive cultural exchange trips. In three years, we have grown this exchange from only two students and three educators from Washington, D.C. to an international program with participation reaching 50 students and 20 educators from Los Angeles, CA; Houston, TX; Atlanta, GA; along with Johannesburg, Cape Town, and Durban, South Africa. Together with our organizational partners, we formed the Global Education Exchange Coalition (GEEC) to plan, coordinate, and execute the cultural exchange.</p>
<p>For this year’s trip, we have established partnerships in DC and abroad to reduce to travel costs for our students as well as enhance their program experience. We have the following partnerships so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href=""https://www.dmvbrw.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">DMV Black Restaurant Week</a> to afford lunch and dinner expenses</li>
<li>Ethiopian Airlines to assist with flight expenses</li>
<li>Embassy of the Republic of South Africa in Washington, DC support</li>
<li>Howard University providing student tours, facilities, and lunch</li>
<li>Georgetown University providing student tours, facilities, and lunch</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>How Your Support Will Be Used</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560271265/qgmf1tfnewjkhrw7ijxj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Here is the breakdown of our budget:</p>
<p><strong>Meals: $700</strong></p>
<p>Covers breakfast for 10 days at $10 per meal for the 7 students. Lunch and dinner will be provided by our meal sponsor DMV Black Restaurant Week.</p>
<p><strong>Flights: $5,000 to 10,500</strong></p>
<p>Covers round trip flights from Johannesburg, South Africa to Washington, D.C. Each ticket costs between about $800 and $1,750. To be conservative we are budgeting for the high cost.</p>
<p><strong>Lodging: $3000 to $4,200</strong></p>
<p>Includes lodging for 10 nights in Washington, D.C. for 7 students. Lodging costs between $45 and $60 per night.</p>
<p><strong>Ground Transportation: $4,000</strong></p>
<p>Two 15-person vans for ground transportation around Washington, D.C. and airport drop off and pick up. The vans are for all of the exchange students.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What Will Happen Next</h2>

<li>Campaign soft-launch, June 5</li>
<li>Official campaign launch, June 11</li>
<li>Purchase flights and secure lodging for exchange students</li>
</ul>
<h3>July</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fundraising complete, July 5</li>
<li>South Africa students arrive in Washington, D.C., July 20</li>

<li>#STEAMtheBlock Party, July 27</li>
<li>South Africa students return home, July 29</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>Risks and Challenges</h2>
<p>Although the Swaliga Foundation has successfully delivered the STEAM Cultural Exchange for the past three years, there are two primary risks that could endanger this year’s program: Airplane ticket prices and visas for the South African students. As we get closer to the date of the trip, airplane tickets will rise dramatically. We have accounted for this in our budget, however, there is still a chance that the ticket prices could exceed our estimated cost. Currently, the South African students are securing their visas. There is a rigorous interview process conducted by the US State Department that costs approximately $300 per person, yet does not guarantee entry into the country. Therefore, there is a chance that these students may not get their visas in time for the trip, which can reduce the number of students who can attend. We are currently working with the students to overcome the financial and temporal challenges associated with obtaining visas.</p>

We have to make sure the youth are properly educated and trained. And it is through education and exposure to other people, through sharing that we learn and we better understand ourselves.”
-Dr. Makaziwe Mandela
 
“Being in this program actually helped cultivate what I wanted to do. I knew engineering was something that I always planned. But, being in Africa and working with these students and really being exposed to STEM and all the technological things that they did. It really helped me see that I wanted to do this for a career.”
-Djeder Basu, student at UMBC College of Engineering
 
“Swaliga is on the cutting edge of a culturally responsible social innovation that clearly activates intrinsic motivation in students and positions them in the pipeline of emerging global citizens”
- Kwabena Boateng, Chair of the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Africa Homecoming
Background: The Challenge and Opportunity

Since 2012, the Swaliga Foundation has been providing STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math) education through after-school programs, cultural exchange programs, and original online content to its youth in Washington, D.C. Over the years, we have identified three important trends in STEAM and education:


Lack of diversity in STEAM fields. This exam by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) also reports that “disadvantaged students remain significantly less likely than their advantaged peers to see themselves pursuing a career in [STEM].”


Opportunities for STEAM jobs rising. Careers in these STEAM fields are projected to account for 70% of job growth by the year 2020 totaling over a million new jobs (National Science Foundation).

Diversity in STEAM signals huge benefits to tech innovation. Diversity matters.  More and more we are understanding why. For example, according to a University of Maryland and Columbia Business School joint study, gender diversity at the management level leads to a $42 million increase in value of S&P 500 firms.

So how do we improve diversity in STEAM? Over the past seven years, we found our most successful program helps solve this question. We call this program #STEAMtheBlock.
 
Meet #STEAMtheBlock

#STEAMtheBlock uses digital art as a bridge to teach Engineering Design and Applied Science. Since 2012 Swaliga Foundation has worked with more than 8,000 youth from the lowest income communities in the DC metro region proving afterschool programming, cultural exchange programs and community workshops at little or no cost to families. In a recent workshop series at McKinley Tech Middle School in Washington, D.C., provided through a grant award from the DC Commission on the Arts & Humanities, Swaliga’s #STEAMtheBlock curriculum resulted in an 87% increase in comprehension in Engineering and Science concepts.
Swaliga’s #STEAMtheBlock program focuses on three main goals:

Increase student efficacy in STEAM
Boost youth engagement in STEAM through digital arts
Build awareness of STEAM related fields

Swaliga uses the arts during STEM instruction in ways that are not seen in traditional school settings. Through creativity and music, students actively engage in learning STEM regardless of learning styles, background or socioeconomic status. The ultimate reward for students who successfully complete the #STEAMtheBlock program is to travel with Swaliga during the STEAM Cultural Exchange, which brings us to why we are here at Indiegogo!
 
The Experience of a Lifetime: The #STEAMtheBlock Cultural Exchange Trip

Our goal is to raise funds to host 7 South African students in our hometown of Washington, D.C.
#STEAMtheBlock culminates in the #STEAMtheBlock Cultural Exchange trip at the end of the school year. Launched in 2016, the trip has sent students and educators from the United States to South Africa to engage with their peers in cultural dialogue and interactive STEAM educational workshops. This week-long international youth summit consists of more than 35 hours of educational programming, as well as a community service project.
2019 will be the first year that our cultural exchange will take place in Washington, DC. In this week-long international youth summit rooted in STEAM, Health & Wellness, and Entrepreneurship & Leadership, seven South African students will join their peers from Washington D.C. and Houston to visit universities, attend workshops and panel discussions, and spend time together enjoying the arts and culture of DC. In total, about 30 exchange students will be participating.
Our community service project will be aimed directly at youth homelessness in Washington, D.C. As with every year, the exchange will culminate in our 4th annual #STEAMtheBlock party on July 27, 2019.

What Have We Done So Far?

Since 2016, the Swaliga Foundation has hosted three consecutive cultural exchange trips. In three years, we have grown this exchange from only two students and three educators from Washington, D.C. to an international program with participation reaching 50 students and 20 educators from Los Angeles, CA; Houston, TX; Atlanta, GA; along with Johannesburg, Cape Town, and Durban, South Africa. Together with our organizational partners, we formed the Global Education Exchange Coalition (GEEC) to plan, coordinate, and execute the cultural exchange.
For this year’s trip, we have established partnerships in DC and abroad to reduce to travel costs for our students as well as enhance their program experience. We have the following partnerships so far:


DMV Black Restaurant Week to afford lunch and dinner expenses
Ethiopian Airlines to assist with flight expenses
Embassy of the Republic of South Africa in Washington, DC support
Howard University providing student tours, facilities, and lunch
Georgetown University providing student tours, facilities, and lunch

 
How Your Support Will Be Used

Here is the breakdown of our budget:
Meals: $700
Covers breakfast for 10 days at $10 per meal for the 7 students. Lunch and dinner will be provided by our meal sponsor DMV Black Restaurant Week.
Flights: $5,000 to 10,500
Covers round trip flights from Johannesburg, South Africa to Washington, D.C. Each ticket costs between about $800 and $1,750. To be conservative we are budgeting for the high cost.
Lodging: $3000 to $4,200
Includes lodging for 10 nights in Washington, D.C. for 7 students. Lodging costs between $45 and $60 per night.
Ground Transportation: $4,000
Two 15-person vans for ground transportation around Washington, D.C. and airport drop off and pick up. The vans are for all of the exchange students.
 
What Will Happen Next

Risks and Challenges
Although the Swaliga Foundation has successfully delivered the STEAM Cultural Exchange for the past three years, there are two primary risks that could endanger this year’s program: Airplane ticket prices and visas for the South African students. As we get closer to the date of the trip, airplane tickets will rise dramatically. We have accounted for this in our budget, however, there is still a chance that the ticket prices could exceed our estimated cost. Currently, the South African students are securing their visas. There is a rigorous interview process conducted by the US State Department that costs approximately $300 per person, yet does not guarantee entry into the country. Therefore, there is a chance that these students may not get their visas in time for the trip, which can reduce the number of students who can attend. We are currently working with the students to overcome the financial and temporal challenges associated with obtaining visas.

<p>The best kinds of opportunities that we can offer to young people are opportunities in which they are doing actual work, hands-on opportunities that are conducive to creativity, free expression, and real-world experience. These opportunities, of course, are hard to come by. Especially among vulnerable populations, opportunities like these – which can lead to tremendous advancement in society – are often scarce to the point of invisibility.</p>
<p>At Speak&amp;Do, we are hard at work launching our content creation initiative, through which we will develop videos for YouTube and podcast shows. We have built up a strong network of influencers, journalists, and other professionals, and we will draw on that network for our content. We will introduce young people to the world of media production, provide workshops, talks, run courses with professional media teams, and organise supervised learning spaces, all directed at fostering talents that would otherwise go to waste. Production will take place in London and Bedfordshire, but we aim to include other areas as well.</p>
<p>As much work as we have put into Speak&amp;Do already, we need to raise some capital to cover the costs of our first round of content creation until we can attract sponsorship from some leading brands. This is where you come in.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Our goal through this campaign is to put together £70,000. These funds will cover the costs of guest stipends, recording equipment, training facilities, travel expenses, and more, everything that we need to pay for in order to build a self-sustaining production and educational programme delivery team for Speak&amp;Do. To say thanks to all our contributors, we are offering some exciting rewards, including the chance to star in our content, limited-edition merchandise and credits in our content.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Motivate. Inspire. Encourage. We want to give young people hope through the work that we are doing at Speak&amp;Do, and we believe in our capacity to change the world one life at a time. Is it going to be easy? Of course not. We all need to come together on this initiative in order to make it a success. Once we hear stories of these young people's growth, though, it will all be worth it!</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>The way that we see it, there is much more risk inherent to not launching this initiative than there is to launching it. We know that logistical challenges will arise as we move forward through the production and post-production processes, but whatever happens, we will figure out what we need to do to get to the next step. Committed to doing this to create outstanding content andhelping young people in need, we will put forth maximum effort, keeping our contributors updated every step of the way.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>In addition to making a monetary contribution to this campaign, you can show your support for Speak&amp;Do by sharing a link to this campaign on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and any other social media platforms you use. Spread the word about our initiative and let all your friends and family know what we are doing. This is something that everyonecan get on board with, and we don't want to keep it a secret.</p>

The fresco has been damaged over the years from unfavorable conditions and vandals. These conditions have led to it falling to pieces. Today, only about 52% of the fresco itself remains. It is located in a former factory building in Gyumri. This will the last opportunity we have to save our beloved Minas' fresco from total destruction. Let’s not allow this last surviving fresco to become construction waste.Frescos by Minas, including the ""Night,"", are recognized as state monuments and should be preserved by the government. Unfortunately, Armenia has many urgent needs and projects today. Thus, its hands are unable to reach the ""Night."" Even if the government decides to do something later, it most likely will be too late.Today, one of our cultural values, the fresco, “Night”, will disappear from the ravages of time and requires an immediate intervention. The Minas Foundation, together with family and friends have initiated this crowdfunding campaign in hopes that each of YOU will engage, support, and make a contribution to save an important piece of our cultural heritage. Any size of donation amount is helpful, even $1. We believe that together we can find a solution to this important issue.Please, also share this initiative on your social media pages and encourage your friends to participate in this fundraising campaign.Arman Avetisyan, the son of Minas Avetisyan, will be responsible for receiving donations, the project management, and public accountability.A total of $26,765 is needed for the complete restoration of the fresco ""Night"" by Minas. Within this Indigogo campaign we are planning to raise $10,000 and the rest we hope to get from corporations, foundations, and the government sources.The summary of the budget is presented below. We'll provide the detailed budget to anybody who is interested in.Materials։ $5,198Supplies and tools։ $1,017Staff & specialists։ $14,650Travel & per diem։ $2,000Misc. expenses։ $3,900После разрушительного землетрясения 1988 года верхняя часть фрески Минаса ""Ночь""значительно пострадала, нижняя часть в основном уцелела. В течении последующих лет и эта часть стала постепенно разрушаться из-за плохих условий, и сегодня она стоит перед исчезновением. На сегодняшний день только 52-55% фрески уцелело. Фреска ""Ночь"" находится в полуразрушённом здании одного из бывших заводов города Гюмри.Быть может, это последняя возможность спасти то, что ещё можно спасти. Нельзя допустить, чтобы произведение великого мастера превратилось в пыль ...Все фрески Минаса являются памятниками искусства и охраняются государством . Но сегодня задачи, стоящие перед государством, многочисленны, средств попросту не хватает, а времени на спасение фрески ""Ночь"" почти не осталось.Фонд ""Минаса"", семья художника, а также друзья инициировали эту акцию по сбору необходимых средств во имя спасения последней фрески художника. Мы надеемся на Вашу поддержку и помощь и уверены, что вместе сможем найти решение столь важного и неотложного вопроса. Любое проявленное с вашей стороны внимание и каждый пожертвованный вами 1$ будет чрезвычайно важен для спасения произведения.

</div></div>","Impact & History of the Exhibit
There can be no doubt that the preservation of the history and heritage of BMW is in good hands with the BMW Car Club Foundation in partnership with America’s Automotive Trust. LeMay – America’s Car Museum is an entity of the Trust. In June 2017, the Foundation, in partnership with BMW and private collectors from across the country curated an exceptional exhibit of rare and legendary examples of BMW Motorsport. Titled “Heroes of Bavaria - 75 Years of BMW Motorsport” they brought together an impressive selection of the most significant BMW racing machines in the company’s history. Now, with your help, several cars from amazing collection have the opportunity to be viewed for the first time on the West Coast. 
The exhibit will feature 17 rare and historically significant BMW motorsports vehicles, plus artifacts and memorabilia displayed in ACM’s remarkable Showcase Gallery in Tacoma, WA.

<p>Les <i>Auto-workshops</i> sont des rencontres entre artistes et non-initié.es sur un terrain vague de Montréal depuis mai 2016, où son occupation ponctuelle sert d’atelier à l’expérimentation de la performance. C’est par le partage de connaissances et l’organisation horizontale que le collectif opère et s’autonomise. Ces journées consistent principalement en des exercices performatifs et des discussions autour de la démarche dans une ouverture au moment présent et à l’autre.  Le collectif des auto-workshops s’intéresse à l'utilisation des corps comme moyen de redéfinition des notions de (non-) lieu et de propriété, sur les capacités d’organisation en groupe ainsi qu’à la dépense de temps et d'énergie en dehors des normes de productivité. Les fissures citadines permettent une liberté d'action où émergent des performances contextuelles  inspirées par les objets et les accessoires trouvés sur leur sol, en plus du paysage atypique dans lequel les corps se glissent. En passant des journées entières dans les marges de la ville, le groupe éphémère développe une solidarité forte et un langage performatif unique.</p>
<p>Les <i>Auto-workshops sur la route </i>sera une «occupation-mobile» qui regroupera sept femmes du terrain Montréalais qui iront explorer les terrains vagues au Canada et aux États-Unis. En mai et juin 2018, le projet souhaite visiter quatre différents terrains vagues dans quatre différentes villes en Amérique du Nord afin de discuter avec chaque communauté spécifique au lieu. Des ateliers de performance se dérouleront à Sudbury, Toronto, Detroit et Montréal, invitant la communauté à s'engager dans une expérimentation corporelle de ces lots citadins délaissés. À la fin de chaque semaine, une présentation publique au terrain vague avec les nouveaux et nouvelles participant.es aura lieu. Les espaces artistiques (Centres d’artistes et initiatives citoyennes) ainsi que les artistes locaux dans les villes visitées seront sollicités préalablement pour rencontrer les communautés à l'extérieur de Montréal et relier nos actions largement.  </p>
<p>Les terrains vagues sont compris et perçus de différentes manières en fonction de l'histoire du territoire et des personnes vivant à proximité. Sudbury et Détroit sont porteuses d’un passé de désertion industrielle majeure qui a laissé de nombreux lots vacants et marqué la mémoire collective d’une sombre suite d'événements. Toronto est un grand centre urbain s’apparentant à Montréal dans sa réalité économique et culturelle. Nous pensons fortement que les particularités de chaque ville que nous comptons visiter nourriront nos réflexions avec de nouvelles considérations. Et nous souhaitons nourrir un dialogue basé sur les expériences acquises par notre collectif sur la route, en plus de rapporter ces recherches dans notre communauté large à Montréal pour informer la tactique de revendication des terrains vagues comme espace sociaux permettant la rencontre.</p>

<p>The financial contribution we are asking for is equal to  one third  of total needs. Our project will need 12 000$ to materialize. Here is what your help can accomplish:</p>
<p>500$ = We rent a a truck to go to Sudbury<br/>1000$ = We rent a a truck to go to Sudbury and Toronto<br/>1500$ = We rent a a truck to go to Sudbury and Toronto and Detroit<br/>2000$ = We rent a a truck to go to Sudbury and Toronto and Detroit and we come back to Montreal!<br/>3000$ = Laurence, Marion and Gab won't sleep in the street!<br/>4000$ = Fanny, Alegria, Julie and Rose won't sleep in the street neither!</p>
<p>The <i>auto-workshop</i> project started in May 2016 in Montreal, where we have been participating in the on-going and sporadic occupation of a forgotten lot with performance art. The collective focuses on the use of our bodies to redefine (non-) spaces and property notions, as well as questioning our capacities to organize in a group and spend time and energy outside the norms of productivity. The <i>terrain vague</i>, as we call it, allows us a freedom of action, which permits contextual performances to emerge. These are always inspired by the objects and props found on their ground and the atypical landscape our bodies slip in. By spending entire days in the city margins, the ephemeral group develops a strong solidarity and a unique performative language. These workshops are not just about/for artists or people who practice performance art – we strongly think that each person’s respective experiences and backgrounds can provide to auto-workshop groups with equal quality. We bring reflections, exercises and questions, but these are malleable to reflect / establish in a group. </p>
<p>The <i>Auto-workshop On the Road</i> project is a group of seven women performers, taking the road next summer to visit vacant lots across the Canada and U.S. Scheduled for June 2018, this project will consist in our collective traveling to 4 different <i>terrains vagues</i> in 4 different cities in North America to engage with each specific community. The workshops would unravel for a week in every city, in one chosen vacant lot, inviting the community to engage in performative experimentations with us. Horizontally organised, they would mostly consist of performative exercises, discussions and knowledge sharing. This process will be concluded by a public presentation taking place with the new participants, as a result of a week of experimenting each space.</p>
<span>            The vacant lots are understood and perceived in different ways depending on the history of the territory and people living nearby. Sudbury and Detroit carry a history of major industrial desertion that has left many vacant lots and marked the collective memory of a dark event. Toronto is a major urban center similar to Montreal in its economic and cultural reality. We strongly believe that the particularities of each city that we intend to visit will feed our reflections with new considerations. And we want to nurture a dialogue based on the experiences of our collective on the road, in addition to bringing this research to our large community in Montreal to inform the tactics of claiming vacant lots as a social gathering space.</span><p> </p>

Les espaces artistiques (Centres d’artistes et initiatives citoyennes) ainsi que les artistes locaux dans les villes visitées seront sollicités préalablement pour rencontrer les communautés à l'extérieur de Montréal et relier nos actions largement.  
Les terrains vagues sont compris et perçus de différentes manières en fonction de l'histoire du territoire et des personnes vivant à proximité. Sudbury et Détroit sont porteuses d’un passé de désertion industrielle majeure qui a laissé de nombreux lots vacants et marqué la mémoire collective d’une sombre suite d'événements. Toronto est un grand centre urbain s’apparentant à Montréal dans sa réalité économique et culturelle. Nous pensons fortement que les particularités de chaque ville que nous comptons visiter nourriront nos réflexions avec de nouvelles considérations. Et nous souhaitons nourrir un dialogue basé sur les expériences acquises par notre collectif sur la route, en plus de rapporter ces recherches dans notre communauté large à Montréal pour informer la tactique de revendication des terrains vagues comme espace sociaux permettant la rencontre.

The financial contribution we are asking for is equal to  one third  of total needs. Our project will need 12 000$ to materialize. Here is what your help can accomplish:
500$ = We rent a a truck to go to Sudbury1000$ = We rent a a truck to go to Sudbury and Toronto1500$ = We rent a a truck to go to Sudbury and Toronto and Detroit2000$ = We rent a a truck to go to Sudbury and Toronto and Detroit and we come back to Montreal!3000$ = Laurence, Marion and Gab won't sleep in the street!4000$ = Fanny, Alegria, Julie and Rose won't sleep in the street neither!
The auto-workshop project started in May 2016 in Montreal, where we have been participating in the on-going and sporadic occupation of a forgotten lot with performance art. The collective focuses on the use of our bodies to redefine (non-) spaces and property notions, as well as questioning our capacities to organize in a group and spend time and energy outside the norms of productivity. The terrain vague, as we call it, allows us a freedom of action, which permits contextual performances to emerge. These are always inspired by the objects and props found on their ground and the atypical landscape our bodies slip in. By spending entire days in the city margins, the ephemeral group develops a strong solidarity and a unique performative language. These workshops are not just about/for artists or people who practice performance art – we strongly think that each person’s respective experiences and backgrounds can provide to auto-workshop groups with equal quality. We bring reflections, exercises and questions, but these are malleable to reflect / establish in a group. 
The Auto-workshop On the Road project is a group of seven women performers, taking the road next summer to visit vacant lots across the Canada and U.S. Scheduled for June 2018, this project will consist in our collective traveling to 4 different terrains vagues in 4 different cities in North America to engage with each specific community. The workshops would unravel for a week in every city, in one chosen vacant lot, inviting the community to engage in performative experimentations with us. Horizontally organised, they would mostly consist of performative exercises, discussions and knowledge sharing. This process will be concluded by a public presentation taking place with the new participants, as a result of a week of experimenting each space.
            The vacant lots are understood and perceived in different ways depending on the history of the territory and people living nearby. Sudbury and Detroit carry a history of major industrial desertion that has left many vacant lots and marked the collective memory of a dark event. Toronto is a major urban center similar to Montreal in its economic and cultural reality. We strongly believe that the particularities of each city that we intend to visit will feed our reflections with new considerations. And we want to nurture a dialogue based on the experiences of our collective on the road, in addition to bringing this research to our large community in Montreal to inform the tactics of claiming vacant lots as a social gathering space.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We're Traci and Kelley, a super powered sister baking duo! For the past two plus years, we've been baking up the greater Atlanta area with our pop events, catering and farmers markets. Coming up on our third year, we're ready to make that transition to a storefront. You always knew just pushing pastries was not the ultimate goal, right?! We know with your help, we can become the pillars that we desire to be with a space to not only stop by and get your sweet fix, but commune and co-create.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As we all know, stuff costs money. The commercial grade, honest, good stuff costs even more money. And instead of building from the ground up, we plan on renovating an existing building that needs a lil' (or a lotta) love. Renovations cost money! And we want an on-site garden ...but money doesn't grow on trees. You catch our drift LOL! And how lovely it would sound to say that our space was built with the love and donations for our fans, not a bank loan?? Just say it out loud... It sounds great. </p>
<p>We're asking for $30k in 30 days! We know it's a lot, but we figure if just 10,000 of you beautiful people donate $3, we're set! And this will be a place you can come and say you helped build. All with a delicious Two Dough Girls treat in yo mouf!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your generous contributions will make this thing a reality. As we mentioned, we will not solely be a pop up bake shop anymore. We want to be engulfed in our community by hosting special events, welcoming other small Black business owners and co-creating. We want to be a destination for locals and visitors and a storefront will make it all possible. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If you've ever built anything from the ground up, then you know growth takes time. Seeing the end result can get blurry (with tears.. or is that doughnut glaze?). And things don't always go as you'd like or how you plan. But with hard work, sweat and determination, a Two Dough Girls shop will be actualized. We see it. And it's glorious.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute financially, but that doesn't mean you can't assist! Email us (twodoughgirls@gmail.com) if you'd like to donate your time or donate items such as kitchen appliances, utensils, dishes, furniture, artwork, etc. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Charley and I'm a poet living in Peterborough. This year I launched the Freak Speak Young Collective, a workshop-style meet-up for young aspiring writers and poets aged 14-25, thanks to a successful funding bid to Arts Council England. The project is funded for a year to offer workshops and performance opportunities for collective members. The collective is free to join and meets bi-weekly at the Key Theatre.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>£500 will allow us to provide match funding for future grants applications. It will also go towards:</p>
<p>- Paying guest artists to come and run workshops for the collective</p>
<p>- Travel expenses to allow participants with low income to attend the sessions</p>
<p>- A contribution towards paying fees for the Young Collective to perform at future Freak Speak gigs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For our most recent gig as part of Peterborough Pride, we printed a series of t-shirts and stickers. These feature our latest monster artwork designed by Lee Mason. A totally rad way to show your support for a talented bunch of young people!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The collective began in April 2018. We meet bi-weekly at the Key Theatre in Peterborough to write, learn, collaborate and develop. The group is diverse and full of motivation to commit to developing their writing. In the sessions so far, we have used poetry as a way to discuss important well-being topics such as mental health, bullying, and online culture. Poetry is a coping mechanism and a friend to these young people. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>So far in addition to running the workshops, I have been able to support three collective members, Leah Barfield, Adi Smalls, and Charlie Maddox, by giving them paid performance slots at the Freak Speak gigs. Quite honestly I feel like a proud mother, and to see their confidence and talents grow in such a short space of time is so gratifying. This is why you should support us, so the group can continue to grow a freaky batch of young poets capable of taking over the world.</p>
<p>Having successfully been supported by Arts Council England twice, this fundraiser will allow me to present the organisation with match funding to allow me to secure more funding for future projects with the group.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
My name is Charley and I'm a poet living in Peterborough. This year I launched the Freak Speak Young Collective, a workshop-style meet-up for young aspiring writers and poets aged 14-25, thanks to a successful funding bid to Arts Council England. The project is funded for a year to offer workshops and performance opportunities for collective members. The collective is free to join and meets bi-weekly at the Key Theatre.
The aim of this project is to offer other young poets the opportunities I wish I had. To create a visible, exciting, meaningful collective who will lead and shape the local and national poetry community.
The funding for Freak Speak goes towards paid performance slots, booking guest poets to deliver masterclasses, one-to-one mentorship time, and each collective member will be receive a professional film recording of one of their poems.
The funding will only keep us going for this year, so this campaign will form the start of my next plans to secure additional funding for 2019 and beyond.

<h3><strong>What We Need</strong></h3>
<p>We are raising funds to help us pay for a combination of speaker fees, film rights, catering, guest artists and teachers across the various events in the month. These funds help us to keep most of the Black History Month Celebration free to the public and therefore accessible to all.</p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Now in its fourth year, Saxapahaw Black History Month is an important and impactful way to celebrate the unique contributions of Black people to American Society. At a moment when many of our communities are more divided than ever, the opportunity to come together as neighbors to celebrate the achievements of those who have been traditionally marginalized by mainstream American society, serves a vision for a more just and equitable world in which we all may live.</p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<p>Please let your friends and neighbors know about our campaign by sharing it on social media or by email. Be an ambassador for the Saxapahaw Black History Celebration, and by all means, please come and participate!</p>

<h3> </h3>
<p>Rwanda is becoming home for many black expats from around the world. With the cost of living, need for innovative business, high safety standards and progressive lifestyles…it is a major attraction for those moving to Africa. Our community is thriving, look at the various social media accounts, friendly emails back and forth and occasional outings. However, due to Covid-19 regulations, as well as the fast rate of our growth…expats are disconnected and don’t have a “landing space” to help them navigate through daily life.</p>
<p>We were brought up on the idea of community. We watch each other’s back. We know the “hook ups” and we share information to help each other. That is what My Cousin Connection is. It is a platform that brings us together, watches and caters to the things we need and fosters networking while we discover who and what we are in this new land.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>And we need it. We have people landing in Rwanda every day, we are here to support, help, empower and build. We are the community that will know where you are and how to connect you to where you are trying to go.  We are the family that has your back.  </p>
<p>Within this network is a unique Care Connection feature that sends monthly notifications out to members, as a safety check to ensure that everything is okay. We know your emergency contact information, important health issues and will even visit the doctor with you in order to ensure that you physical being is cared and accounted for. We are the people your momma will call when she don’t hear from her baby. Basically, we got your back.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2>Website &amp; App Outline</h2>
<p>We operate with three main purposes, which are outlined in the functionality of the website/app.  </p>
<p>1)  To provide information to black expats who are looking to relocate to Rwanda</p>
<p>2)  To support black expats living in Rwanda</p>

<p> </p>
<h2>Roll Out</h2>
<p>There are Three Phases in order to bring My Cousin Connection to full capacity.  We do this in order to ensure that your donation is used in the best capacity.  This phase roll out will help create sustainability and allow the organization to support itself, based upon member subscriptions and not donations. </p>
<p>Phase One Roll Out</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615563939/znzkdaowsxpjyoifj00z.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Phase One allows our promise to our members to be fulfilled as well, catches a large expat movement that will occur during the summer months.  By focusing first on the website we are able to have a product available within a two month span and start catering to the needs of the black expat community. </p>
<p>Phase Two</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615563992/rgazqonyhzm8cpce5ccu.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Phase Two introduces the app portion, used in the same dual capacity.  Now members can be connected via website or smartphone based upon their preference.  We also make sure that this is able to be accessed for all our generations of users.  We also begin monthly notifications, when members get a push notification to ""check-in"" and they respond with a personalized code.  This is our first system of safety checks as well as knowing the number of expats in Rwanda.  </p>
<p>Phase Three</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615564678/f4duzd3tlc8sgcvr9bya.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Phase Three is full incorporation of the app and website and everything working at 100%.  The Care Connection is also working at full capacity with personalized support.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>How it Works</h2>
<p>In order to keep sustainability, once we roll out My Cousin Connection, we will have a $5 monthly subscription fee for members.  Once we reach a minimum of 100 subscribers, we will have full capacity to run the program plus employees and build a self-generating income to cover the minimum expenses associated with the company. </p>

<h2>Why Support</h2>
<p>We need you.  We need the community to come out and build community.  This is like that ""Rent Party"" back in the day,  or the passing of the church bucket.  We need you to make this happen for us.  We have the opportunity to change what life aboard can look like for people trying to explore different ideas.   In our world, we must have a watchful eye for each other and this is the way to do it.  Organized, detailed and purposeful, we allow you the freedom to explore but the support system to help guide you when you need us.  As well, we must have that emergency network system in place to ensure that we are and will be okay. </p>

For the 13th year running, ISWiB’s organizational team is working tirelessly to establish another great festival in July 2019. About 250 students from all over the world are gathering in Belgrade during summer to enjoy everything that ISWiB has to offer. They are ready to actively participate in cultural and scientific workshops, work on solving critical global issues and, at the same time, to represent their country in the best way possible. Through our various educational workshops and entertaining events we ought to connect young people from different cultural backgrounds from all over the world in order to prosper multicultural dialogue. In addition, we put an emphasized accent to anti-discrimination and inclusivity.What being a part of ISWiB Community means?

1000+ participants
from 100+ countries

300+ organizational team members

30+ promoters

120+ moderators
  “So far, I have not spoken about what it means to spend a night in Belgrade while on ISWiB. And you know what, I won’t. Because the experience cannot fit into a paragraph, a page, or some paper that can be scrolled back and forth. It’s something that words can do no justice to, and while my eloquence can go a lot further than that, I will spare you the unnecessary word count and would simply suggest you apply for a summer that can really change your life. Or at least those parts of it that are much less exciting. If you’ve come here to learn, don’t bring a pen and a notebook. Just free your mind off of all the negative energy, and get ready to inhale the miraculous redeeming air of Belgrade.”Constantina Bandutova, ISWiB participant “If you wish to visit the whole world then you are in the right place. During ISWIB you visit the whole world in a single place. I found incredible friends that I still actively keep in touch with (oh hi, Poli, Rosa, Milos T, Milos N, Ana, Bojan, Pedja, Agatka, Sonjuska, Tamara, Andjela, Monika, Perko, Ania, all of the Jelenas, Alex and the list goes on and on and on). I fell in love – with people and the city that I keep coming back to every year. I got to wave my national flag across the streets of the Serbian capital alongside people from all continents, I laughed and cried, while still feeling happy on the inside.”Ashraf Noori, ISWiB participant “It does not really matter if it would be as a participant, a moderator, an organizer or a volunteer, the International Student Week in Belgrade has the power to unite ideas and experiences and create a family of hundreds of people, brothers and sisters from different countries, from the same planet called Earth.”Emanuele Carnevale, ISWiB workshop moderator  We need your support to be able to cover festivals’ expenses, as well as to make ISWiB 2019 bigger and better than ever before!  We hope to source $3000 from kind supporters on Indiegogo (like you!) to fund a part of the festival’s expenses.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Almost 1200 years ago, a king was killed in battle. He was king Audbjørn, king of one of the most important Viking districts in Norway; Fjordane. He was a wealthy king with a high status in the Viking society, and his ship was amongst the largest Viking ships that the world has seen. But this 100ft long historic treasure followed its king in his funeral, where it was reduced to ashes together with his fortune.</p>
<p>Now history is about to rise from the ashes as the re-build of the Myklebust ship has begun, only inches from where the ship last sailed into battle.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Story</h3>
<p><strong>The Battle of Solskjel</strong><br/>In the Viking Age the warrior identity stood strong, and the Vikings did not only fight on their journeys to other countries, but they also fought each other. There were numerous kings ruling different parts of Norway, and many of them were eager to gain control over larger areas. One of them was king Harald who wanted to gain control of the entire country, and gather Norway as one kingdom.</p>
<p>The spring of the year 876, king Harald gathered his army and prepared to sail south to Sunnmøre. A king named Solve Klove had spent the winter attacking Harald’s men in north Møre, and also spent some time with his friend, king Arnvid, in south Møre. When they got the word that king Harald was coming, they gathered their troops, which grew fast as many people held a grudge against king Harald.</p>
<p>Solve Klove travelled to Nordfjord to king Audbjørn of the Fjords, and asked him to join them with his army. As the choice stood between working together and create an army that was big enough to have a chance against Harald, or to surrender and become king Harald’s slaves, the choice was easy. King Audbjørn promised to come, and sailed north with his men to join the large army.</p>
<p>They met king Harald by the island of Solskjel on the coast of northern Møre, and they battled him from their ship. It was common practice to tie the ships together side by side when they battled at sea, and the bravest warriors, the berserks, fought in the bow of the ship. This is also how they fought in the battle of Solskjel, and men fell on both sides. Finally, king Harald became so savage that he drove king Arnvid’s army back all the way to the mast of the ship, and stepped aboard. Many of king Arnvid’s men fled, and king Arnvid himself fell in the battle. King Audbjørn also fell, but Solve Klove fled and managed to get away.</p>
<p>After the battle King Audbjørn’s body was brought back to Nordfjordeid where he was cremated together with his ship and other belongings. The ship burial with cremation was a pagan custom, similar to how the norse God Balder was cremated in the sagas. According to Ibn Fadlan’s descriptions of a Viking burial, the cremation was in order to ensure the king a fast journey to Valhalla, and not to leave him to rot in the ground.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490435868/wg1suqc6lpapbxnu6wa7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The battle of Solskjel was described in king Harald’s Saga “Heimskringla”, and dates the battle where king Audbjørn fell to the year 876. This correlates well with the dating of the Myklebust grave to the last half of the eight hundreds. It is quite unique that this grave can be tied to historic sources and named persons, and this gives us an incredible insight into king Audbjørn’s death.</p>
<p><strong>The Myklebust ship</strong></p>

<p>The practice of rivet built Scandinavian vessels is known from older iron age, but it was not until about year 500 that these vessels were equipped with sails and rigs. This technological advancement is what made the Viking age possible, and the reason for the Vikings further expansion and military dominance in this time. The vessels were fast, went in shallow water and did not need a harbor, and they could sail even in unfavorable onshore wind conditions.</p>
<p>The large Viking ships that have been described in the sagas have through several ship graves in Scandinavia been found to have existed in real life, and the “Myklebust” ship is the largest one that has been excavated in Norway. The large dimensions of the split rivets and nails used in the ship reveal that this was a ship of considerable size. The estimations conclude the ship was about 100ft long, 21ft wide, and the bows raged around 22ft high. It had about 48 shields and 24 oar pairs, the number of shields most likely represent the number of crewmembers on the ship.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What we want to do</h3>
<p>Our goal is to rebuild the Myklebust ship in full scale with all its original features and interior that followed it on it's journeys on the sea. The ship should be able to be rowed on the fjord, but most of the time it will be exhibited on land in the Sagastad center, which will be built specifically to host the ship. Sagastad will be built to look like a burial mound, and will be a center aimed at experiencing the history connected to the Viking age in the region.<br/><br/>Our goal for this crowdfunder is $100 000, which is actually less than 10% of the cost of the whole ship, so it is a huge project. But every little helps, and we would be absolute delighted if you can help us reach our goal, and support our soon to be living cultural heritage! If we reach our goal this could fund the thousands of split rivets in the ship or could go a long way on funding the dragon or serpent head of the ship. Your help could even mean the difference between getting the sail for the ship or not!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How we will do it</h3>
<p>The rebuild of the “Myklebust” ship has already started on the shore of Nordfjordeid where you can follow the build through several viewings throughout the year. The ship is being built by boat builders from Bjørkedal in Møre og Romsdal, where boat building traditions go back several centuries. The building of the ship started in December 2016 and the plan is to finish it by January 1 in 2019.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/sagastad/videos/1614571418571216/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490436021/epcc2ccwj5tattqywtd5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<p>Click photo to see video from the build.</p>
<p>We will have regular viewings at the building site, which will help fund the building and create an interest in the project. In order to ensure the authenticity of the project, we cooperate with several organizations like the University museum in Bergen and the culture department of Sogn og Fjordane County. We are on our way, but we need your support to complete the project.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>It takes many resources to build a Viking ship like this. We have specialized boat builders, materials produced specifically for the project and people working with the planning and viewings of the ship. The project has been lucky to receive a lot of interest and support locally, but we think this is spectacular enough to reach out to the world. As of 2017, Nordfjordeid will become a cruise destination with its own sea walk, and we need to be ready to let the world see our project in work. A pot of funding would help us pay for things like;</p>
<ul>
<li>Materials for the ship</li>
<li>Our boat builders wages</li>
<li>Guides to tell the story at our viewings</li>
<li><p>Technical equipment like microphones and a projector to show the progress in pictures during our viewings</p></li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Eventually you will get a spectacular Viking ship, which you can visit in the Sagastad center in Norway. It should also be possible to row it on the fjord on special occasions.</p>
<p>For those who donate $20 you will get your name on our website.</p>
<p>If you donate $50 you will also get a signed Sagastad thank you postcard sent home to you.</p>
<p>For $250 we will also include a Sagastad birthday calendar in your package which will help you remember the birthdays of your loved ones or any other important dates.</p>
<p>We are also going to make a book with pictures from the whole build and until the launch on the fjord. This book will be yours and sent to your mailbox if you choose this $500 perk. Also includes all perks listed above.</p>
<p>When it is all finished you can get a personal tour of the Sagastad center and the Myklebust ship through Skype. This $1000 perk will even allow you to virtually climb aboard the finished longship. We will answer any questions you may have, and also include all of the above listed perks.</p>
<p>If you donate $5000 we will do something really cool. We will put your name in the “Window of opportunity”, the window by the entrance of the Sagastad center. Here we want to present you who have given us this unique opportunity to complete our project.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490435765/zzzdot2ehentjmdd1urt.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>If you donate $10 000 you will get a lifetime experience. You will not only get all of the above perks, we will also invite you to a special Viking event in Nordfjordeid the spring of 2019 when both the ship and the Sagastad center is finished. Exactly what this event will be is not entirely settled yet, but it will be something worthy of a Viking king!</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are risks and challenges ahead, and we are making plans to manage them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Economic risk. This crowd funder is a part of reducing the financial risks in this project. The more support we get from you, the less funds will need to come from loans.</li>
<li>Visiting hours during the build. We will need to be flexible to ensure that our visiting hours give us the best possible profit.</li>
<li><p>Launching of the ship once it is finished. There is no absolute guarantee that the ship will actually float once launched, or that it won't be harmed during the launch, but our experienced boat builders are taking every precaution. In addition, we are asking everyone for their prayers to Thor and Odin!</p></li>

When they got the word that king Harald was coming, they gathered their troops, which grew fast as many people held a grudge against king Harald.
Solve Klove travelled to Nordfjord to king Audbjørn of the Fjords, and asked him to join them with his army. As the choice stood between working together and create an army that was big enough to have a chance against Harald, or to surrender and become king Harald’s slaves, the choice was easy. King Audbjørn promised to come, and sailed north with his men to join the large army.
They met king Harald by the island of Solskjel on the coast of northern Møre, and they battled him from their ship. It was common practice to tie the ships together side by side when they battled at sea, and the bravest warriors, the berserks, fought in the bow of the ship. This is also how they fought in the battle of Solskjel, and men fell on both sides. Finally, king Harald became so savage that he drove king Arnvid’s army back all the way to the mast of the ship, and stepped aboard. Many of king Arnvid’s men fled, and king Arnvid himself fell in the battle. King Audbjørn also fell, but Solve Klove fled and managed to get away.
After the battle King Audbjørn’s body was brought back to Nordfjordeid where he was cremated together with his ship and other belongings. The ship burial with cremation was a pagan custom, similar to how the norse God Balder was cremated in the sagas. According to Ibn Fadlan’s descriptions of a Viking burial, the cremation was in order to ensure the king a fast journey to Valhalla, and not to leave him to rot in the ground.

The battle of Solskjel was described in king Harald’s Saga “Heimskringla”, and dates the battle where king Audbjørn fell to the year 876. This correlates well with the dating of the Myklebust grave to the last half of the eight hundreds. It is quite unique that this grave can be tied to historic sources and named persons, and this gives us an incredible insight into king Audbjørn’s death.
The Myklebust ship


The practice of rivet built Scandinavian vessels is known from older iron age, but it was not until about year 500 that these vessels were equipped with sails and rigs. This technological advancement is what made the Viking age possible, and the reason for the Vikings further expansion and military dominance in this time. The vessels were fast, went in shallow water and did not need a harbor, and they could sail even in unfavorable onshore wind conditions.
The large Viking ships that have been described in the sagas have through several ship graves in Scandinavia been found to have existed in real life, and the “Myklebust” ship is the largest one that has been excavated in Norway. The large dimensions of the split rivets and nails used in the ship reveal that this was a ship of considerable size. The estimations conclude the ship was about 100ft long, 21ft wide, and the bows raged around 22ft high. It had about 48 shields and 24 oar pairs, the number of shields most likely represent the number of crewmembers on the ship.
 
What we want to do
Our goal is to rebuild the Myklebust ship in full scale with all its original features and interior that followed it on it's journeys on the sea. The ship should be able to be rowed on the fjord, but most of the time it will be exhibited on land in the Sagastad center, which will be built specifically to host the ship. Sagastad will be built to look like a burial mound, and will be a center aimed at experiencing the history connected to the Viking age in the region.Our goal for this crowdfunder is $100 000, which is actually less than 10% of the cost of the whole ship, so it is a huge project. But every little helps, and we would be absolute delighted if you can help us reach our goal, and support our soon to be living cultural heritage! If we reach our goal this could fund the thousands of split rivets in the ship or could go a long way on funding the dragon or serpent head of the ship. Your help could even mean the difference between getting the sail for the ship or not!
 
How we will do it
The rebuild of the “Myklebust” ship has already started on the shore of Nordfjordeid where you can follow the build through several viewings throughout the year. The ship is being built by boat builders from Bjørkedal in Møre og Romsdal, where boat building traditions go back several centuries. The building of the ship started in December 2016 and the plan is to finish it by January 1 in 2019.

Click photo to see video from the build.
We will have regular viewings at the building site, which will help fund the building and create an interest in the project. In order to ensure the authenticity of the project, we cooperate with several organizations like the University museum in Bergen and the culture department of Sogn og Fjordane County. We are on our way, but we need your support to complete the project.
 
What We Need
It takes many resources to build a Viking ship like this. We have specialized boat builders, materials produced specifically for the project and people working with the planning and viewings of the ship. The project has been lucky to receive a lot of interest and support locally, but we think this is spectacular enough to reach out to the world. As of 2017, Nordfjordeid will become a cruise destination with its own sea walk, and we need to be ready to let the world see our project in work. A pot of funding would help us pay for things like;

Materials for the ship
Our boat builders wages
Guides to tell the story at our viewings
Technical equipment like microphones and a projector to show the progress in pictures during our viewings

 
What You Get
Eventually you will get a spectacular Viking ship, which you can visit in the Sagastad center in Norway. It should also be possible to row it on the fjord on special occasions.
For those who donate $20 you will get your name on our website.
If you donate $50 you will also get a signed Sagastad thank you postcard sent home to you.
For $250 we will also include a Sagastad birthday calendar in your package which will help you remember the birthdays of your loved ones or any other important dates.
We are also going to make a book with pictures from the whole build and until the launch on the fjord. This book will be yours and sent to your mailbox if you choose this $500 perk. Also includes all perks listed above.
When it is all finished you can get a personal tour of the Sagastad center and the Myklebust ship through Skype. This $1000 perk will even allow you to virtually climb aboard the finished longship. We will answer any questions you may have, and also include all of the above listed perks.
If you donate $5000 we will do something really cool. We will put your name in the “Window of opportunity”, the window by the entrance of the Sagastad center. Here we want to present you who have given us this unique opportunity to complete our project.

If you donate $10 000 you will get a lifetime experience. You will not only get all of the above perks, we will also invite you to a special Viking event in Nordfjordeid the spring of 2019 when both the ship and the Sagastad center is finished. Exactly what this event will be is not entirely settled yet, but it will be something worthy of a Viking king!

 
Risks & Challenges
There are risks and challenges ahead, and we are making plans to manage them:

Economic risk. This crowd funder is a part of reducing the financial risks in this project. The more support we get from you, the less funds will need to come from loans.
Visiting hours during the build. We will need to be flexible to ensure that our visiting hours give us the best possible profit.
Launching of the ship once it is finished. There is no absolute guarantee that the ship will actually float once launched, or that it won't be harmed during the launch, but our experienced boat builders are taking every precaution. In addition, we are asking everyone for their prayers to Thor and Odin!

Their rigorous training, hopes, dreams, daily challenges, family support or lack thereof, successes and failures, will be captured and the series will be used locally for education as well as marketed regionally and internationally to highlight the lives of artists in the Caribbean. This project is being planned in conjunction with the National Cultural Foundation of Barbados. We will work with hundreds of dancers, teachers, students, youth, and members of the general public over the course of three weeks. The project will positively impact every individual participant, and send ripples of heart-opening, boundary shattering, consciousness shifting inspiration out into the fabric of Barbadian society.Soul Dance is part of an on-going incentive to cultivate a new dimension of the Performing Arts throughout the Caribbean and Barbados is the first stop. We are already in the process of establishing connections in Jamaica with the goal of launching our first GiveBack Performing arts and Fashion project there in the coming months. We are excited to unfold similar projects throughout the Caribbean, which are tailor-made for each island, taking into consideration their unique arts and cultural heritage.GiveBack - The TeamCelia Grannum Celia Grannum is a Barbadian who takes the sunshine wherever she goes. She completed a B.F.A. in Dance at New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts, and pursued a career as a dancer, choreographer and teacher in the U.S., U.K., Japan, Switzerland and The Netherlands. She moved effortlessly between jazz, modern, contemporary and ballet styles, which allowed her to work with the likes of Tony award winning choreographer Wayne Cilento and Rafael Bonachela, Director of Sydney Dance Company, and be a founding member of London’s renowned Ballet Black. She directed her own company in Amsterdam, which was the hub of a vibrant freelance community. Her study and practice of Pilates, Yoga and Mindfulness, Thai Yoga Massage, and Homeopathy, deepened her understanding of anatomy, physiology, and the vital force, and aided her development of an anatomically sound, effective teaching style.Kris JobsonKris was born in Kingston, Jamaica. A consummate artist - a creative and artistic director, dancer, choreographer, speaker, writer, singer, actor and model - he received his B.F.A degree from the prestigious New York University, Tisch School of the Arts. Kris also had the pleasure of training at the Dance Theatre of Harlem, Alvin Ailey and The Joffrey Ballet schools. He has worked on TV shows, commercials, films and various productions as the Lead Talent and as creator/Director throughout Italy, Germany, Switzerland, China, U.S.A., South Africa, Morocco, Austria, Scandinavia, Japan and Thailand. Kris is currently the Choreographer and Principal Dancer for the Andrea Bocelli World Tour for the regions of Germany, Switzerland and South Africa. Having modeled for Calvin Klein, Verri, Fucci, Aimer and Triumph, and appearing on numerous print campaigns, Kris is also part of the Fashion Sector as a Director, choreographer and coordinator of many international Fashion shows such as Mercedes Benz Fashion Week Berlin, Milan, Shanghai and the Vogue Salon Shows in Germany.Alex MilewskiGiveBack Guest Alex Milewski is a full time movement artist, wellness coach and educator. Since 2006 he has competed, taught and performed around the world. Over the last two years Alex has travelled extensively in Central and South America facilitating dance trainings, intensives and dance-focussed community building activities in underserved communities. His movement style is rooted in BBoying, Martial Arts, Tricking, Contemporary and House Dance. His mission is to lead people through movements and emotions that they have never experienced before, inspiring new thinking and creativity. Alex focuses on this mission full time by continuing to be a student in many styles of movement and performing, competing, and exchanging with dancers and students on a daily basis. He is the founder of Block 1750 - a center for dance and community in Boulder, Colorado.Ricky MendezRicky Mendez is the founder of Reverie Films, in Miami, FL. Film is Ricky’s passion, and when he is not working on the set of feature films like Bad Boys For Life, or coordinating commercials for major cruise line companies, Ricky channels his creative talent into his own short-film ventures. A child of Dominican parents, Ricky feels the Caribbean running through his veins, and after working on the GiveBack Barbados | Be Moved project in October 2019, he is excited to return to capture Soul Dance on film.GiveBack - FundingWe are seeking funding to cover the project expenses so that all of the activities and events can be offered free of charge. Barbados is in a strained economic state and many Barbadians are experiencing dire financial situations. As is common the world over, the Arts are the first institutions to suffer in times of economic difficulty. We want every person, regardless of their financial situation to be able to participate in the inspiring, life-affirming activities of GiveBack Barbados | Soul Dance. Items to be funded:Airfare for visiting artists from the U.S.A. and EuropeAccommodation in BarbadosLocal transportation for visiting artists Scholarships so that all dancers may participate in workshops free of chargeRehearsal and performance fees for local dancers Fees for visiting artists for teaching, choreography and Artistic directionFees for visiting film crew for production and post-productionFees for local film assistant Dance studio rental in Barbados for classes and rehearsalsVenue rental and event fees for Dance Awareness DayCostumes for performances Transportation for local artists to pop-up performances  Our entire budget will be used to manifest Soul Dance. If we exceed our fundraising goal, all monies will be used to kickstart our next GiveBack project throughout the Caribbean! Besides the knowledge that you are supporting a unique project which will have far-reaching consequences both in Barbados and throughout the Caribbean, we will keep donors in the loop by providing:- updates as the project unfolds in April-  behind the scenes look at rehearsals and workshops  - sneak peeks of performances GiveBack - Why?...because Art matters, music matters, learning matters, uplifting each other matters, a sharing community matters, moving our bodies matters, emotional intelligence matters, communication matters, consciousness matters, kinesthetic awareness matters,self-regulation matters, self-expression matters, relationship matters, joy matters, creation matters, giving back matters. It is these things which make us human, and in a world and in a time when our very humanity is being questioned, threatened and undermined, being human matters. GiveBack - ChallengesWe are very understanding of the fact that our goals will not be achieved in the course of three weeks spent on the ground in Barbados. We see Soul Dance, following closely on the heels of Be Moved, as the second step in a long journey of sharing, reconnecting, educating and inspiring change and growth in the Caribbean artistic community and their audiences.  The dancers who participated in Be Moved recognized that this was ‘more than just dance’, and that as much as we were helping them to refine and re-pattern their physical movements, we were addressing them on an energetic level and sharing invaluable tools to be employed in daily life. The journey of GiveBack will be a long and fruitful one, and it is our dedication to our soul family in the Caribbean and to the island roots which nourished us until we could ourselves take flight across the wide world, which will sustain us over the coming years as this project evolves and expands. GiveBack - With Appreciation for all that you doIf you are unable to make a financial contribution to our project, we would greatly appreciate your sharing our fundraising platform with anyone who may be interested in our movement. Whether through social media sharing, or old fashioned word of mouth, we are grateful for your support!",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Tony and I have a passion for music and local music in particular. I've always been drawn to new, local and slightly under the radar musicians and bands. Being a less than amateur musician myself I wanted a way to get involved and give something back to my local music scene. So this is it...</p>
<p>Micro Music is a pop-up music idea that will go to interesting places that don't usually have live music. I want to be able to give local performers a platform to complement what is already out there and hopefully offer something a little different. I see this as a way to promote local music, local businesses and support some local charities as well.</p>
<p>Micro Music will benefit musicians, local businesses and local charities. Musicians will benefit by having another series of paying events, venues will benefit from increased trade and each event will be linked with a specific charity.</p>
<p>If you decide to contribute to this idea you will be enabling more music, helping a small part of the ever so important local community and just generally making things better. And I will be eternally grateful!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So why am I doing a fundraiser for this project? To make this work I need some kit. I need good enough equipment to be transportable, easy to set up and robust - and most importantly it has to sound good. But I want it to be cheap enough that its realistic to raise the money. So after some research my ideal amount to raise is £2,000. </p>
<p>That will allow me to get a good portable PA, quality microphones, a small mixer and all the other bits-and-bobs to make noise. It will also allow some extra things to help me advertise and promote. For example some Micro Music banners and other promotional materials.</p>
<p>For the perks I've kept it simple. I don't really have a product as such that I can lure people with so I've kept the rewards low-key and I hope the idea is enough to inspire you generous people.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I am a firm believer in the power of music to change lives. It offers a creative outlet for people, it brings people together, it lets people share ideas and thoughts, it builds local communities and is generally a force for good. Anything anyone can do to increase the amount of local music available to complement what is already there can only be a good thing. Who knows, maybe one day Micro Music's will be available all over the country.</p>

CHALLENGE and RISKS 
Why open a space in the middle of a worldwide crisis?
COVID-19 : Some of the most innovative business ideas have been launched during times of crisis, so we have decided to take advantage of the pause in tourism activities to realize our next dream which was to open a cultural center / concept store. We want to create a space you can virtually visit and call home while international frontiers are still closed and visit in person when international travel resumes. How is it possible to plan what will be the scale of international travel in the next six months? The tourism industry has been hugely impacted and forecasts are planning a full restart only  at the beginning of  2021. This means less walking tours and other public events for us to plan.
How do we address this change in the industry?
Through our travel guides, our community will keep traveling through the images it contains, learning, and discovering. So promoting that travel tool by producing a new one and making it available is one solution. It is very important for us also to invest more into digital content. We know images speak more than a thousand words. That’s why launching a TV show is part of our strategy.  Strikes and protests​ : Besides cheese, wine and baguettes, you may have heard that France is also very popular for its strikes and social protests! Sure, you heard about the Gilets Jaunes protests that started in mid-2018 and continued to the end 2019! And then guess what? Another social movement in the form of transit strikes started right away, paralyzing the entire country for 3 months! The Metro, Bus, TGV, Tramway systems were not working, so people had less opportunities to get out and explore a city.
So how have we tackled this?
We know that patience is a virtue and that sometimes certain things are not possible given the current state of affairs. For this reason, we have been investing primarily into digital content. We recognize the continued need for investing into great material to facilitate hosting online events at our space that you can follow online. Construction Schedule and Risks: With every construction and renovation project  there are inherent risks of delays and cost overruns.
How are we mitigating this risk?
                 We have projected a 3 month construction schedule for the space, which is a conservative estimate for the renovations that will need to take place. We have selected an up and coming designer to design and project manage the renovation who has already successfully designed 2 beautiful concept store spaces in Paris without significant budget and schedule overruns. 
                The project construction will commence in early September, and end at the end of November. Our goal is to have the space opened by the start of the Christmas holiday season.

AND THEY ARE BEING WATCHED
Today's social networks are trolled by bots and blinds gathering information on these users. Family members and local agencies uses social media to track you. Facebook has been shutting down cannabis sites (here's an example - click here), twitter is full of fake accounts, and Instagram and SnapChat are not forms to maintain your voice and opinions.

<p><strong>DAH Theatre is the first professional independent theatre company founded in Serbia in 1991, </strong>who have been effectively creating highly artistic and socially engaged performances and projects for a quarter of a century. In a country that suffered through war, embargoes, sanctions and bombing, our work has often proven to be a struggle, sometimes even dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>Last year our City left us homeless. </strong></p>
<p>""DAH Theatre is a processed-based theatre company, and it is their process that stands out and influences theatre makers around the world."" - Del Hamilton (DAH Theatre: A Sourcebook, 2016)</p>
<p>We have always believed that our work is necessary and important, not only in Serbia, but also in the rest of the world. This year we received living proof for this when a book about our work was published:  DAH Theatre: A Sourcebook, edited by Dennis Barnett and published by Lexington Books, USA, 2016.</p>
<p><strong>We found a new home!</strong></p>
<p>For the past several years we have been constantly fighting a battle to have a space where we can perform both the artistic and the managerial aspects of our work. A month ago, we finally succeeded in finding a space – we moved into a wonderful new space that can accommodate our needs, in the very centre of Belgrade. The best news is that we signed a contract and that we can stay in the space for many years to come. It seems that DAH Theatre has finally found a home.</p>
<p><strong>But our new space needs to be adapted</strong> (see specification below) and this is why we have to ask for your help. We can’t do this alone anymore. Every day we write applications for support, work on our current projects, plan future ones and create new performances.<br/><br/>We need your help in order to keep doing this for the next 25 years.</p>
<p>The renovation costs are € 15 000.<br/>The impact of our work is priceless.<br/><br/><strong>Is it a home without friends?</strong></p>
<p>Help us to build a new home which can continue to be a hub for making connections, provoking, inspiring, and encouraging transformation all over the world; a home where we will be able to host you, our friends, visitors, collaborators. It could be an island of light in our city!</p>
<p>Besides donating money directly to our bank account, <a href=""https://www.paypal.me/dahtheatre"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PayPal</a> or by <a href=""https://secure.moneygram.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Moneygram</a>, there are many other ways you can raise money to help us if you are willing to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organize a performance/concert/ exhibition, in your space/city and donate part of the funds from tickets to DAH</li>
<li>Use any manifestation that is already in your repertoire and donate part of the funds to DAH</li>
<li>Put the donation boxes during your programs so your audience can donate as well</li>
<li>Publicly announce that you are raising money for us and spread the word about our campaign via Facebook, or any other social network.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>So far we did amazing things, now help us do the impossible!</strong></p>
<p>Roof reparation - 6000€<br/>The installation of electricity and water - 2000€<br/>Wall Chiselling and smoothing - 1000€<br/>Wall painting - 400€<br/>Front door - 600€<br/>Reconstuction of bathroom and tea-kitchen - 2000€<br/>Furniting of offices - 1000€<br/>Coolers/heaters (AC)  - 1000 €<br/>Web site redesign - 1000€</p>
<p>If we don’t reach the goal, all the collected funds will go to the roof reparation that is the most urgent. If we collect more that the predicted sum, all the rest will go to the renovation of the performing space.</p>
<p>We are hoping that we can count on solidarity of all of you, our theatre friends that know and follow our work. We also know that times are generally hard and that need for support is huge and we do understand if you can not support us now.  </p>
<p>But any donation would be of great help to us, we shall have one wall with all your names in our theatre. But the best would be that our theatre home would become theatre home for many artists in need and of course for all of you dear friends.</p>

We are an indigenous nation comprising of more than 40 different tribes with a population of about 4 million approximately. We live in the northeastern part of India and northwestern Myanmar. The Naga tribes have a shared history, culture and identity. Oral traditions such as folktales, myths, songs, and poems are passed down from generation to generations.
