<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The main purpose of social network is to keep up with what’s going on with our friends’ lives, so you’d think it would be pretty obvious that scrolling through your news feed will show you a list of what your friends are posting in the order that they’re posted. When it comes to what you see in your feed (i.e., what is being posted by your friends and people/Pages you follow).You will end up missing posts you would be very interested in or you keep seeing the same posts at the top of your feed after you’ve already read them. They’re also not in the order they were posted, so you’ll see one post from three days ago, followed by another from 10 minutes ago, followed by one from yesterday, etc. which don't make for a very natural experience.</p>
<p>Have you noticed that you are only seeing updates in news feed from the same people lately?</p>
<p>have you also noticed that when you post something like status,messages,photos,images,links and video  the same group of people are commenting and everyone else seems to be ignoring you?</p>
<p>You will also often find that unless you make a paid promotion, a few in your audience will actually see your social media status update. This is due to their algorithms that determine what people see in their news feeds. An average  6% of your audience will see what you post on other social networks. In comparison to this an average email open rate of 22% and you can see the difference. In Other words, if you have 2000 facebook fans or friends &amp; 2000 twitter followers on twitter - this is what you will get.</p>
<p>120 facebook fans will see your status updates and40 twitter followers will see your tweet.</p>

<li>
<i>How to remain focused on the important and not get sucked into the urgent</i>. Imagine the key ideas from 50 books on prioritized actions that are all values-based... ideas that will get you to stop and think before you blunder your way to confusion and conflict. Result: more of the RIGHT things done each day.</li>
<li>
<i>How to set achievable goals... make plans to support them</i>... and develop powerful leadership teams to leverage your time and talents. Imagine the best ideas, from true leadership experts, on the power of delegation, synergy and effective team-building. You naturally become an Authentic Leader, not just someone who is faking it until they can make it.</li>
<li>
<i>How to live out of passion and purpose, optimistically pursuing a life that matters</i>. Imagine simple truths all reduced to key ideas you can act on in the moment to achieve a life of satisfaction, significance, and meaning. If you truly lived a life of meaning, wouldn't that make you and your extended family happy?</li>
<li>
<i>How to eliminate, fear, doubt, indecision, preoccupation, distractions </i>and big negatives from your personal and professional performance. Imagine 5,000 different 10 second training moments that keep you on track — all in the palm of your hands — coaxing, coaching and training you to take bold action to rise above the fray and WIN!</li>
</ol><p>You would have to read 3-4 entire books each day to get a similar idea flow on personal and professional success... and it still wouldn't be condensed for instant use. You would have to wade through pages and pages of ""stuff"" to grab those few actionable gems of wisdom we all need in our life!</p><p>This is not yet another motivational quote app — it is real <u>training</u> within a 10-second construct focused on knowledge, repetition, and recall. You learn a new idea, apply it instantly and achieve greater results... now, not later.</p><ul>
<li>You feel just a bit LUCKIER...</li>
<li>You feel more in CONTROL of your day...</li>

Can you really afford to permit the status quo to rule?Not if you are concerned with your own family's well-being, let alone the children of the world.The consensus of world leaders is that a better educated, better trained and higher skilled population is both the short and long-term solution to the problems we see in our everyday lives. In a world of chaos and conflict, we all need to perform up to our full capabilities. When we do, we all WIN.""Mediocrity is the root of the malaise we are in. Excellence is the antidote."" ~ E. R. Haas, CEOPermit mediocrity to take root in your own life, you live a less fulfilling life. But when you reject mediocrity and make excellence your prevailing aspiration, you not only win personally — the world at large becomes a better, safer place.What CAN you do now?You can support The World Excellence Project™!  A contribution of $5-$20-$100 will help us do something incredibly powerful, new and different: Make EXCELLENCE the global aspiration thereby releasing the full potential of every person on the planet... starting first with YOU!""How wonderful it is that nobody need wait a single moment before starting to improve the world."" - Anne FrankIn today's world, we face a huge barrier: Access...In today’s world, only a tiny percent of the population have access to any real training or mentoring. Only a lucky few have the benefit of a coach to instruct them to reach higher and achieve more. This means people are going through life burned-out... stressed-out... and running on empty most of the time. They needlessly struggle financially and emotionally:
Single working moms — many holding down two jobs — have no money or time to be trained.
Employees with significant potential have no mentor to guide their climb up the ladder — especially if they hope to shatter the glass ceiling.
Hard working small businesses around the world have limited access to role models who would teach them how to be more productive and make better use of their time.
Until now. Let's take advantage of the billions of Smartphones people already carry in the palm of their hands —  install The Time Prism:® The Smartest App On Earth — and let's change this dysfunctional, broken, screwed up world we call home. Really break free of tired, status quo thinking and do something different: Teach the world to do GOOD by doing BETTER so we can all achieve MORE out of life.The Time Prism will snatch back time that is ordinarily wasted andturn it into a productive learning experience for billions of people who need it the most but can afford it the least.With your help, we will make personal success training — real life skill-building — as prevalent and fun as music streaming... and as freely available as Twitter, Snapchat, or Facebook.How Does It Work? 3 Simple Steps...1. SET it...2. FORGET it...3. CHECK in when it chimes!This is a Transparent Learning™ Engine that trains you in success-critical skills... making you incrementally smarter all day long. Better, you LEARN without even KNOWING you are learning!Because you receive a constant flow of positive new ideas — from the over 10,000 unique, 10-second training sequences — The Time Prism shapes your thoughts and influences your choices and actions in real time. You achieve more by doing better each day.
You get more DONE...
You produce better RESULTS...
You become more SUCCESSFUL.
What Will You Learn? In a Nutshell...

How to get far more done in far less time. Imagine the ideas from the major ""get organized and get things done"" style books all neatly condensed and distilled for immediate action — helping you make smarter decisions during your next phone call, meeting or sales presentation.

How to remain focused on the important and not get sucked into the urgent. Imagine the key ideas from 50 books on prioritized actions that are all values-based... ideas that will get you to stop and think before you blunder your way to confusion and conflict. Result: more of the RIGHT things done each day.

How to set achievable goals... make plans to support them... and develop powerful leadership teams to leverage your time and talents. Imagine the best ideas, from true leadership experts, on the power of delegation, synergy and effective team-building. You naturally become an Authentic Leader, not just someone who is faking it until they can make it.

How to live out of passion and purpose, optimistically pursuing a life that matters. Imagine simple truths all reduced to key ideas you can act on in the moment to achieve a life of satisfaction, significance, and meaning. If you truly lived a life of meaning, wouldn't that make you and your extended family happy?

How to eliminate, fear, doubt, indecision, preoccupation, distractions and big negatives from your personal and professional performance. Imagine 5,000 different 10 second training moments that keep you on track — all in the palm of your hands — coaxing, coaching and training you to take bold action to rise above the fray and WIN!
You would have to read 3-4 entire books each day to get a similar idea flow on personal and professional success... and it still wouldn't be condensed for instant use. You would have to wade through pages and pages of ""stuff"" to grab those few actionable gems of wisdom we all need in our life!This is not yet another motivational quote app — it is real training within a 10-second construct focused on knowledge, repetition, and recall. You learn a new idea, apply it instantly and achieve greater results... now, not later.
You feel just a bit LUCKIER...
You feel more in CONTROL of your day...
You become more HOPEFUL...
You feel EMPOWERED...
You feel relaxed... more POSITIVE...
You feel a greater sense of CONTROL & wellbeing...
You feel like things are finally coming together... you're getting AHEAD...
You feel SMARTER and more capable of handling things as they come up.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Loukas and Eugene are two geeky entrepreneurs with Master's Degrees who have created a way to make passwords secure again over the internet. </li>
<li>Making the internet secure again is a labor of love for us. With your support we will transform our work from a proven idea into a security solution that everyone can use.</li>
<li>We are building a cloud version for personal public use that you can access to secure what you do online.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need $75,000 to transform our current version into a cloud version that everyone can access. </li>
<li>We would like to provide the service to your small business or personal website.</li>
<li>If we do not reach the entire amount needed, we will continue working and eating macaroni and cheese until done and purchase as much cloud services as possible to bring our security solution to the public.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>The public's privacy is being violated nearly everyday. Passwords are routinely stolen and then account information sold to bad actors. We want to stop this!</li>
<li>We want people to be able to trust internet sites again.</li>
<li>No more hustle with all the passwords you need to remember. One will be more than enough to keep you safe.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>People are apprehensive about security systems. They feel like they ask too much. So, we have created a solution that does not require people to do anything or be anyone other than themselves while doing what they already do. To keep people safe, we do not transmit or store passwords or permanent characteristics. We use only transitory, partial, and  passphrase specific information that cannot be used in any other context keeping your privacy safe. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p><strong>Q: How is this different from a keystroke logger?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>We do not store any typed characters. We use a subset of your typing rhythm and style.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q:  If someone types my password at the same speed as me, will they get in?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>KeyDyn uses typing speed along with your rhythm and style. In a population of 10,000 people your personal combination of speed, rhythm and style is generally unique.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q:  What happens as my typing changes?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> KeyDyn expects your typing to evolve over time and accurately tracks and anticipates your changes. In rare cases when identification is problematic, we automatically identify the issue and provide seamless secondary email authentication.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: What happens if my hand is injured?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> KeyDyn will adjust to dramatic changes in behavior, such as caused by injury, major illness, or innovative form factor changes. Radical changes may temporarily trigger self-managed secondary-authentication requests, which will stop once the new and dramatically different behavior is confirmed to be your behavior.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q:  How quickly does KeyDyn learn my typing style?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Recently we advanced how quickly a user is recognized. Previously between 9 and 16 typing samples were required. Now, we start after 3 samples.</p>

<p><strong>Bullet Planner is a personal organization method and scaffold for your optimized life. </strong>You'll keep track of your priorities and tasks and build in ways to stay motivated.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>""My Bullet Planners are really some of my most valuable possessions. The BP is amazing to rewind time and capture your life, and make the most of living in the present” </i></p>
<p>I'm Lili, the creator of Bullet Planner. I am have spent years studying productivity methods and  perfecting the ideal organization method— <strong>this <i>hybrid planner</i> supports you being your best organized, self-motivated, in tune self. How? </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What BP isn’t:</h2>
<p><strong>This book doesn’t tell you what to do or restrict you. </strong>Layouts can be interpreted and used differently year-to-year and person-to-person. Each week has flex page space, making the Bullet Planner one of the most flexible planners around. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What BP is:</h2>
<p><strong>The Bullet Planner is a minimalist system to manage your tasks and time, follow through on your goals, and track personalized data points. </strong>By doing so, you will experience the ability to hack your habits and find persevering clarity. </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>1] </strong><strong>The minimalist layouts support you, you make the BP your own. </strong>The minimalist layouts look great as is— and provides the ideal space for art-overflow. (The time saved from drawing out grids can be applied to making the most of your energy.)</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>2] Habit tracking allows you</strong> <strong>to </strong><strong>understand which of your life areas are flourishing and which need more work. </strong>I've found a lot of benefit to looking at visual representations of all areas of your life at once. (<u>blog post: How to track meaningful habits</u>) </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Generally, the reason why we fail to grow in particular areas of our lives is due to subconscious limiting beliefs and a fixed mindset.

</div><p> </p></div>","Bullet Planner is a personal organization method and scaffold for your optimized life. You'll keep track of your priorities and tasks and build in ways to stay motivated.
""My Bullet Planners are really some of my most valuable possessions. The BP is amazing to rewind time and capture your life, and make the most of living in the present” 
I'm Lili, the creator of Bullet Planner. I am have spent years studying productivity methods and  perfecting the ideal organization method— this hybrid planner supports you being your best organized, self-motivated, in tune self. How? 
 
What BP isn’t:
This book doesn’t tell you what to do or restrict you. Layouts can be interpreted and used differently year-to-year and person-to-person. Each week has flex page space, making the Bullet Planner one of the most flexible planners around. 
 
What BP is:
The Bullet Planner is a minimalist system to manage your tasks and time, follow through on your goals, and track personalized data points. By doing so, you will experience the ability to hack your habits and find persevering clarity. 
 
1] The minimalist layouts support you, you make the BP your own. The minimalist layouts look great as is— and provides the ideal space for art-overflow. (The time saved from drawing out grids can be applied to making the most of your energy.)
2] Habit tracking allows you to understand which of your life areas are flourishing and which need more work. I've found a lot of benefit to looking at visual representations of all areas of your life at once. (blog post: How to track meaningful habits) 
Generally, the reason why we fail to grow in particular areas of our lives is due to subconscious limiting beliefs and a fixed mindset. Logging key points of interest over time is a great self transparency method and can expose interesting insights about yourself. 
3] There is considerable power in commiting things to ink and paper. The best way to promote the things we value most is to remove everything that distracts us from it. The planner medium is analog and simply a scaffold. If you struggle to get done what you intend to, or loose track of tasks or long term goals, try the BP method. 
2021 is going to be your year. Choose to write it in ink, fill a volume with your life, and feel the satisfaction of crossing lists out, as you take on all your life's opportunities and challenges.

CGScan is a software for procedurally generated 3D assets that are based on scanned data and architectural research. We are a small self funded team that is passionate about games, cinema and architecture. Our goal is to help creators and studios build faster and cheaper full 3D Environments for their projects.
 

 

Since January 2020 our team started collecting scanned and architectural data and think how we can combine those two and learn computers to procecurally generate assets that people build.

What We Need & What You Get
 

We need 150 000 euro to help us grow our team and develop the CGScan software.

The Impact

 

CGScan Software is an easy to use 3D Software that is backed by powerful algorither to generate fully custom 3D Assets. Creating procedurally generated assets is very time consuming and also requires a lot of knowledge in different areas.

It provides the safety and protection of a sleeve, the ergonomy of a laptop stand, the portability essentials of a storage bag, and a look that lets you commute in style.There are already laptop sleeves out there. But most are either too bulky or lack room for extra accessories. That’s what we set out to do and re-invented it to a slim and compact carry sleeve with an invisible stand and storage. It adheres to the MOFT’s design philosophy ”Good product is invisible” It’s a wise carry-on solution for short-distance commuting. From the office to the cafe to school, MOFT keeps your day-to-day adventures light and convenient.  Designed by exclusive structure, the MOFT Carry Sleeve can be folded up to a stand in literally one second. With your laptop screen raised to a higher level, you will naturally sit straighter and negate physical stress. With MOFT carry sleeve, you don’t need to carry an extra laptop stand around with you - it’s already there, making your work life healthier without anything extra.We designed MOFT sleeve to have two angles -  15° and 25°. Now, browsing through files and documents or having online meetings will be much more comfortable when your laptop is placed on the stand in 25° angles, which is the highest angles among the sleeves. And if you work at a higher desk? The 15° is ideal for an improved, strain-free view. We all know that there are always some items you need, aside from the laptop. MOFT’s interior has convenient, expandable storage for this very reason. The bag is all you need to keep essentials such as power adapters, notebooks, cell phones, mouses, etc. It’s almost magic how MOFT can keep expanding to offer the room you need without adding bulk - thanks to the neoprene material that shapes it to any carry-on essentials.The innovative fold-in triangle structure makes it sturdy and stable enough to prop up your device. It can support up to 10 kg and fits all laptops on the market.MOFT Carry Sleeve is made with customized PU material and fiberglass, making it slim, lightweight and durable while looking superb. You can carry your laptop in a sleek style, without the bulk.  It gives you a feather-soft touch feeling just like real leather with a sense of technology. Folding endurance keeps it in shape even it’s folded a thousand times.MOFT carry sleeve is made by 100% vegan PU leather material. It's eco-friendly and more sustainable than animal leather. Plus, the animal leather is not water-resistant. It absorbs water and gets quite wet.A Lately we got much feedback that some of our users wanted to have one for iPad as well. We hear you! We successfully upgrade the carry sleeve to another version which will suit iPad just fine. There are two sizes for iPad Pro 11 and iPad Pro 12.9” respectively.

About usWe are Central Saint Martin's Product Design graduates of 2015. Months of hard work have gone into the making of our final year products and we can't wait to share them with the world this June in London. This year, we will be exhibiting products that tackle challenges in industry from health care to politics, and we hope that in the course of our degree show we will be able to convince many visitors of our visions and designs.
Why are we asking for donations? 
The degree show will be the first opportunity for most of us to showcase and present ourselves to the public. Therefore it is a crucial milestone on our journeys to become Product Designers, and will hopefully be a starting point for our professional careers. 
We are willing to go the extra mile to make this year's show the best Central Saint Martin has ever seen, however, unfortunately great ideas and ambitious plans alone, aren't enough - they also need to be financed.
Our campaign is aiming at current and former CSM students, friends and families, as well as professionals and corporations related to the college. 
For donations we are offering a range of perks. For details please refer to the individual explanations on this website.

What will your money be used for?
By contributing to the fund raising campaign for our Degree Show you will help us to convey our wide range of design concepts to potential employers and the public. 
To allow visitors a better overview we will produce an illustrated Degree Show Catalogue, featuring everyone's work and the underlying processes. 
In order to make the most the dedicated space we would like to invest in new exhibition stands, allowing us to present both, our self-initatied and our client projects, in the most appropriate way.
Last but not least, an active promotion of our Degree Show to the press, the public and interested corporations will help to foster our personal careers and at the same time will have a positive impact on the perception of the BA Product Design Course at Central Saint Martins. This way, also future generations of CSM students will benefit from a success of our Degree Show.

Other ways to help us. 
Please spread the word of our campaign! Any support in kind (materials, printing, equipment, press coverage, food and beverages) is highly appreciated.

As an amateur online filmmaker, I didn’t have the budget to truly go to school or invest in expensive filmmaking software, so when I saw Lis’ app I was hooked! I am not a professional video producer or actor by any measure which is why the filmmaking course was so appealing. I cannot wait to see this program come to life because it will be a total game changer. For the small donation of $100 I was able to help this mobile application come to market, get a film school certification, and enter for a chance to win $1000! Who doesn’t love that combination!?”</i></blockquote>

As an amateur online filmmaker, I didn’t have the budget to truly go to school or invest in expensive filmmaking software, so when I saw Lis’ app I was hooked! I am not a professional video producer or actor by any measure which is why the filmmaking course was so appealing. I cannot wait to see this program come to life because it will be a total game changer. For the small donation of $100 I was able to help this mobile application come to market, get a film school certification, and enter for a chance to win $1000! Who doesn’t love that combination!?”

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi Karen Reid CEO of The Flexie Bench.</p>
<p>As a freelancer and an owner of several small businesses over the years, I have often felt frustrated at not being able to secure as many large contracts as I know that my team and I could deliver.  Sometimes I had been let down by contacts who said they would be available and then, in the middle of preparing a response to a bid, that same contact suddenly takes on a new contract leaving me in a pickle!</p>
<p>Not so long ago, while leading a large change programme at an engineering company of circa 30,000 employees, it felt like a never ending challenge trying to get credible resources at short notice, and it was then that the idea hit me!</p>
<p>There are more than enough opportunities for freelancers and small businesses we just need an enabling mechanism to enable us to find each other.  The rest is history so to speak!</p>
<p>Our concept for The Flexie Bench is designed to empower growing companies, to scale their workforce when needed, and to be confident about the integrity and skills of the members of their teams. Think about a bench of skills that is available on demand and can be rotated in and out of projects, as and when required, but without the usually associated overheads, and you'll get the idea!</p>
<p>We are an online resource providing a link between contractors (freelancers etc.) and companies and the ability for individuals and small teams to join forces to provide specific skills in a specific timeframe.</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<div><div><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/215098904?color=a8723b?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div></div></div>
<p>We envisioned a virtual global community working together to build and strengthen each other's companies, so that everyone can grow. SMEs account for over 95% of businesses, 60%-70% of employment and we generate a large share of new jobs.  Our size and agility makes us strong, but we have other challenges that make it difficult for us to compete – and this is where The Flexie Bench comes in.  We will help growing prospects to:</p>
</div>
<p>find and secure contracts with larger organisations</p>
<p>join up to create a virtual team to bid and win larger contracts</p>
<p>build confidence and skill to go up against a larger competitors</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>

<p>#2 We have developed our platform, to allow us to make a credible quick start. </p>

<p>#4 We need to ensure the first group of users are referenced checked to make a great 1st impression and keep to our promise of credible resources.</p>
<p>We want to ensure that we can get this valuable resource to the right people quickly and we are keeping in real about the help we now need to get this all done.  In line with our concept we are reaching out especially to small businesses &amp; freelancers to develop and launch this remarkable service.</p>
<p>We now need to raise £33k to help with operating costs and to launch into the market and this is how that number is broken down.  </p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>

Hi Karen Reid CEO of The Flexie Bench.
As a freelancer and an owner of several small businesses over the years, I have often felt frustrated at not being able to secure as many large contracts as I know that my team and I could deliver.  Sometimes I had been let down by contacts who said they would be available and then, in the middle of preparing a response to a bid, that same contact suddenly takes on a new contract leaving me in a pickle!
Not so long ago, while leading a large change programme at an engineering company of circa 30,000 employees, it felt like a never ending challenge trying to get credible resources at short notice, and it was then that the idea hit me!
There are more than enough opportunities for freelancers and small businesses we just need an enabling mechanism to enable us to find each other.  The rest is history so to speak!
Our concept for The Flexie Bench is designed to empower growing companies, to scale their workforce when needed, and to be confident about the integrity and skills of the members of their teams. Think about a bench of skills that is available on demand and can be rotated in and out of projects, as and when required, but without the usually associated overheads, and you'll get the idea!
We are an online resource providing a link between contractors (freelancers etc.) and companies and the ability for individuals and small teams to join forces to provide specific skills in a specific timeframe.
 


We envisioned a virtual global community working together to build and strengthen each other's companies, so that everyone can grow. SMEs account for over 95% of businesses, 60%-70% of employment and we generate a large share of new jobs.  Our size and agility makes us strong, but we have other challenges that make it difficult for us to compete – and this is where The Flexie Bench comes in.  We will help growing prospects to:

find and secure contracts with larger organisations
join up to create a virtual team to bid and win larger contracts
build confidence and skill to go up against a larger competitors

Risks & Challenges
We’ve learned how to analyse our larger competitors to find out possible weak points.

<p>The above book trailer video is for the novel <u>GateKEEPERS</u> I coauthored with a retired University of Michigan Professor – based on a true story mine, about my first major challenge to the architectural profession’s resistance to the changes demanded by the real estate industry.  A management change, I hope to help bring to the architectural profession.  Please read on to learn more about my story.</p>
<p>As reported in the UK Parliament website (<a href=""http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/building/palace/architecture/palacestructure/churchill/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/...</a>), “In October 1943, following the destruction of the Commons Chamber by incendiary bombs during the Blitz, the Commons debated the question of rebuilding the chamber. With Winston Churchill's approval, they agreed to retain its adversarial rectangular pattern instead changing to a semi-circular or horse-shoe design favoured by some legislative assemblies. Churchill insisted that the shape of the old Chamber was responsible for the two-party system which is the essence of British parliamentary democracy: (Winston Churchill's famous quotation) 'we shape our buildings and afterwards our buildings shape us.'”</p>
<p>Innovations have been some of the strongest building blocks of our great nation and the planning and design of our buildings will significantly influence innovations in our future.  It is important to point out and to consider that the design of our buildings and the management process by which they occur are significantly influenced by the managerial and communication skills of the architectural design teams involved.  Unfortunately, even today the architectural education system is significantly deficient in training student architects about necessary and proven business theories and principals required for architects to perform their responsibilities more effectively – and this deficiency carries into the profession of architecture.  This is a big part of the reason architects have lost significant managerial responsibilities during the past few decades to design/build firms, property management companies, and facility managers.</p>
<p>My objective is to help bring about a change that is required in our very competitive international business world that would enhance university and business knowledge and understanding of the many benefits (user increased production and building construction and operating cost savings) that are derived from a building design process that employs proven management principals and participative management concepts.  In my case, the education, research and development costs are completed and paid for.  I have applied the concepts discussed in this Indiegogo campaign throughout my professional career.  These concepts were applied in 2002 when I had coauthored the Site Selection Guide for the U.S. General Services Administration first used for new federal courthouses and later to my understanding for most other federal property site acquisitions and expanded in my paper presented at the United Nations endorsed International Council for Research and Innovation in Building and Construction (CIB) W70 2004 Hong Kong Symposium.</p>
<p>I remain in excellent shape mentally and physically – have been in process of participating in Krav Maga (React Self Defense) classes the past five months (with a reported 30% police participation), belong to local YMCA, and remain very physically fit mentally.  My history described in this proposal demonstrates wisdom, endurance, and the tenacity to never give up.</p>
<p>The issue here is funding, and if this proposal is fully funded, I promise to focus the majority of the remainder of my career to help expand upon the public’s knowledge of the many benefits derived from an ongoing participative management process throughout the architectural design phases.  This will include actions to help and work with universities, the architectural profession, businesses, institutions, and government agencies to better plan and utilize their facilities based on more effective planning and communication.</p>
<p>PLAN AND OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>If this Indiegogo campaign is successful, since capital is needed my intent is to spend most of the remainder of my professional career focused on sharing my lifetime of knowledge and experience to help the architectural profession, businesses, institutions, and government agencies to better plan and utilize their facilities… through more comprehensive and formalized efforts to share information and to plan facilities based on both short- and long-term strategic objectives… with the objective to reduce construction and operating costs and increase productivity based on facilities designed more in tune with user needs.</p>
<p>During the first phase, I plan to contact and attempt to collaborate with the Arizona State University School of Design and W. P. Carey School of Business or the Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture – more likely Arizona State University because of their strong combined resources. A successful Indiegogo campaign will likely add relevance to my efforts to gain the cooperation of others needed to achieve a successful campaign; i.e., to contact and work with and for universities, the architectural profession, businesses, institutions, and government agencies.  I plan to contact Phoenix area businesses on an ongoing effort to provide them with information about the short- and long-term benefits of employing participative management concepts and principals from the early architectural design phases through construction and building operations.  In phase II, plan to take the program national to universities, business, and government agencies – with the hope to receive national publication interest.  I remain a licensed architect and my BSBA focused on marketing – was a marketing director with a national business architectural firm; and, was a marketing vice-president with two national real estate services companies – understand how and the benefits of effective marketing.  Also have an MBA (organization behavior) and a Master of Architecture.</p>
<p>If only partial funding is received, I would take actions to utilize funds to help address the issues mentioned in this proposal; i.e., contact local schools of architecture to try to encourage them to address required business education issues needed within their programs.  In any case, this is a process issue that would likely take years to accomplish, and with the cost of higher education today, it might take a generation or two for young people with similar education and experience that I have accomplished to occur.</p>
<p>In early 2002 I prepared a facility management membership survey for the then Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) affiliated International Society of Facilities Executives (ISFE), distributed by the ISFE to their entire membership for my analysis and presentation at their national symposium. Sadly, the 9/11 attacks occurred that led to the ISFE to cancel their national symposium. However, because of the survey’s success and the significance of the data and its analysis the ISFE decided to print a special edition (May 2002) of its monthly newsletter titled “Membership Survey Results.” The survey presented a number of organizational trends concerning in-house and outsourced real estate management.</p>
<p>The ISFE newsletter publication led to the lead editorial in Buildings magazine in October 2002 titled “The Complexities of Communications” – (based on my research and data analysis completed for the ISFE).</p>
<p>The ISFE and Buildings publications led to my invitation to write and present a paper for the CIB W70 2004 Hong Kong Symposium “The Human Elements of Facilities Management – Understanding the needs of the customers.” My paper was titled “The Organization Behavior Component of Facilities Management – Becoming Part of the Business Process.” The paper, in addition to other republications continues to be included on the Fraunhofer IRB website. Fraunhofer IRB is Germany’s central facility for national and international knowledge transfer in planning and building. The Fraunhofer IRB website states that they include papers “mainly from German speaking countries.” Therefore, as an American, I took this as an honor. It was and remains important to me to share knowledge to help society.</p>
<p>Please find a copy my CIB W70 paper and other relevant documents related to this campaign attached in this campaign's image gallery.  The campaign card image photograph shown on the bus included the CIB W70 Board members – I was invited to attend after my presentation.</p>
<p>HISTORY</p>
<p>Early during my architectural career while I was enrolled in the Ohio State University School of Architecture to earn my last degree, a Master of Architecture, I learned that opposition to change and new ideas remained strong. During the previous seven years I had earned three previous university degrees – two from Ohio State, B.S. degrees in architecture and Business Administration, and an MBA from Case Western Reserve University. During that previous seven year timeframe I had also worked summers and full- and part-time for architectural firms.</p>
<p>During the summer of 1974, a few weeks before I earned my MBA, I met with the then Chairman of the Ohio State School of Architecture to discuss possible enrollment in the 1974 fall quarter Master of Architecture program. The meeting was positive and included an agreement for about 40 hours of elective transfer credit from my MBA program; and, I presented a 15 hour credit independent study proposal – to share my combined business school and architectural knowledge with the local architectural community in the form of a survey to be distributed to all Columbus, Ohio area architectural firms by my personal interviews. The study’s analyzed results were intended to be shared with the local and national architectural communities. My intent was to synthesize my architectural education with the business education that focused on marketing (undergraduate) and organization behavior (MBA).</p>
<p>The Chairman was enthused about the idea and suggested two School of Architecture advisors to both share in the study – one was their most tenured professor and the other an adjunct professor who was also the president of the Architects Society of Ohio (ASO) – the state component of the American Institute of Architects (AIA). I agreed to accept and meet with both architecture professors and requested one additional advisor – a nationally recognized marketing professor in the Ohio State College of Administrative Science who was my undergraduate professor. All three professors had agreed and I enrolled in the Master of Architecture program.</p>
<p>During the fall quarter of 1974 and the winter quarter of 1975 I had developed the survey and met with several area architectural firms to test and enhance the survey based on their inputs. The School of Architecture even gave me my own office and some secretarial support. The survey focused on the marketing of architectural services and the organizational component of shared information to achieve business goals.</p>
<p>All was going great, the School of Architecture and I prepared an internal funding application request for review by the Ohio State University administration – documents were completed ready for my advisor signatures. During my funding discussions with the School of Architecture it was recommended that I attempt to meet with leadership from the Cleveland and national AIA offices. I contacted the Cleveland chapter AIA president and the Washington, D.C. AIA Executive Vice-President. We met at Nightgown restaurant located near the top of Cedar Hill in Cleveland Heights, Ohio. About a week later I received a letter from the national AIA Executive Vice-President that stated the AIA would not fund my study… a few days later the Chairman of the School of Architecture called me into his office to inform that my independent study would be stopped, but he gave me a 5-hour credit with an ‘A’ for work completed. The internal funding request had just been signed by my three advisors and the Chairman, but was not yet submitted to the university administration for its review and approval. In my opinion the AIA did not want the marketing know-how information promulgated to the architectural community.</p>
<p>I did not protest – I was a graduate student who wanted to earn his degree. During the fall quarter of 1975, my last before I had earned my Master of Architecture, one of my stopped independent study advisors had become ill – the president of the ASO. The Chairman of the School of Architecture asked if I would alone without supervision take over his graduate level Professional Practice course. I agreed and completed the course that had included my review and to determine grades of the graduate students mid-terms and final papers.</p>
<p>I had to submit grades for all of my graduate students the week after I had received my Master of Architecture degree. I had cleaned out my Columbus apartment and moved all of my personal belongings back to Cleveland. I returned the night before I had to turn in grades and got a room at the Ohio Stater hotel. About 3:00 a.m. a tall thin man in a ski mask broke into my first floor room through a window. He woke me when he stepped on the bed to steady himself as he had entered. I knew how to defend myself and attacked him… he stumbled out of the same window he had broken into. In the morning, I turned in the grades to the university and later in the day met for a scheduled meeting in the home of my former advisor who had been the president of the ASO.</p>
<p>I wound up working for one of the Cleveland architectural firms where I had been employed while I had earned my MBA. In December 1976 I sat for my Ohio and national architectural licensing exam. I did not pass one of the four parts of the national exam by two percentage points. During my follow-up research I found on file at the State Board of Examiners of Architects a recommendation from my former advisor who was then the previous president of the ASO – it said I was “Regarded as one of the top students overall to graduate from Ohio State University,” and “This man is highly qualified to be brilliant in the profession. The potential is all there.” I met with the State Board of Examiners board of directors – a very intimidating and humbling experience – was made to feel very small.</p>
<p>Again, I did not pass the exam the next year, but this time I had learned all of my exams drawn in my own hand had been destroyed by the State Board of Examiners of Architects in violation of Ohio statues. That’s when I hired an attorney to challenge – it had become clear that it had become a darned if you do and darned if you don’t situation. I didn’t want to walk away – too much knowledge to share with the profession and society.</p>
<p>I applied for a license without examination under the Ohio Revised Code (ORC) section 4703.08 part A. I had met all of the criteria, but the State Board of Examiners after a lengthy hearing where they were represented by an Assistant Attorney General said NO! The Board claimed that the statute I had applied under was a grandfather clause and not even one architect was licensed in Ohio under the statue. It was not! The actual grandfather clause expired in 1932 and the statue I had applied under was revised by the Ohio Legislature twice in the 1960s and another time in the 1970s. The Board worked with the Ohio Legislature to have ORC 4703.08 part A removed as an emergency measure. I fought that with the support of the Wisconsin and California architectural licensing boards. The day after the law was signed by the Governor, after a request by the then Ohio Senate President Pro-tem, the Secretary of the State Board of Examiners released a list of approximately 350 architects that had been licensed under ORC 4703.08 part A. Do you recall the movie “Tucker: The Man and His Dream?”</p>
<p>However, I realized early on that a battle of this magnitude would require multi-fronts to win. While my Ohio administrative and legal court battles progressed I had made contact with various national publications to try to take my battle public to become part of the public record. This led to a headline article titled “One Architect in Search of a License” for the National Center for the Study of Professions headquartered in Washington, D.C. – among others. This led to an invitation to speak on September 24, 1979 before the Subcommittee on Elementary, Secondary, and Vocational Education of the Committee on Education and Labor – United States House of Representatives – Ninety-Sixth Congress – Subcommittee on Elementary, Secondary, and Vocational Education and Labor, Washington. D.C. regarding: The Truth in Testing Act of 1979; and The Educational Testing Act of 1979.</p>
<p>A couple weeks before I had taken the national architect licensing exam for the last time in December, 1979, I met to discuss the upcoming national architect licensing exam with the then Director of the Ohio State University School of Architecture. The then Director, of Japanese descent, did not want to discuss the exam – instead, he told me about his life as a child when he and his teacher parents had been sent to a United States internment camp during World War II. He told me that he understood prejudice and that was the reason I was having trouble passing the exam. He stated that I should not worry and that for sure I would pass the exam on my next attempt – which I did with one of the higher national scores. Shortly after, I was invited to appear on the TV program 20/20, but I decided to pass in an attempt to move on.</p>
<p>Approximately two years later, the national architects licensing exam was removed and replaced and a more valid internship program had been established – to my understanding based on a consent decree with the Justice Department and/or the Federal Trade Commission.</p>
<p>In 2008 I released a novel named GateKEEPERS I coauthored with a retired University of Michigan professor that tells the story of my saga to earn my license to practice architecture. The website for the book can be found at <a href=""http://www.domarbooks-gatekeepers.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.domarbooks-gatekeepers.com</a> It’s available at many locations online. The novel is NOT the intent of this Indiegogo funding request.</p>
<p>This is my last hurrah. Without the capital not sure how I might become positioned to effectively share my warehouse of knowledge. With the cost of college today, not sure how many generations it might take to find a person with a similar education and experiences that loves to share that knowledge with society. Without the funding, I intend to utilize my knowledge and experience to help people buy and sell homes.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

During the previous seven years I had earned three previous university degrees – two from Ohio State, B.S. degrees in architecture and Business Administration, and an MBA from Case Western Reserve University. During that previous seven year timeframe I had also worked summers and full- and part-time for architectural firms.
During the summer of 1974, a few weeks before I earned my MBA, I met with the then Chairman of the Ohio State School of Architecture to discuss possible enrollment in the 1974 fall quarter Master of Architecture program. The meeting was positive and included an agreement for about 40 hours of elective transfer credit from my MBA program; and, I presented a 15 hour credit independent study proposal – to share my combined business school and architectural knowledge with the local architectural community in the form of a survey to be distributed to all Columbus, Ohio area architectural firms by my personal interviews. The study’s analyzed results were intended to be shared with the local and national architectural communities. My intent was to synthesize my architectural education with the business education that focused on marketing (undergraduate) and organization behavior (MBA).
The Chairman was enthused about the idea and suggested two School of Architecture advisors to both share in the study – one was their most tenured professor and the other an adjunct professor who was also the president of the Architects Society of Ohio (ASO) – the state component of the American Institute of Architects (AIA). I agreed to accept and meet with both architecture professors and requested one additional advisor – a nationally recognized marketing professor in the Ohio State College of Administrative Science who was my undergraduate professor. All three professors had agreed and I enrolled in the Master of Architecture program.
During the fall quarter of 1974 and the winter quarter of 1975 I had developed the survey and met with several area architectural firms to test and enhance the survey based on their inputs. The School of Architecture even gave me my own office and some secretarial support. The survey focused on the marketing of architectural services and the organizational component of shared information to achieve business goals.
All was going great, the School of Architecture and I prepared an internal funding application request for review by the Ohio State University administration – documents were completed ready for my advisor signatures. During my funding discussions with the School of Architecture it was recommended that I attempt to meet with leadership from the Cleveland and national AIA offices. I contacted the Cleveland chapter AIA president and the Washington, D.C. AIA Executive Vice-President. We met at Nightgown restaurant located near the top of Cedar Hill in Cleveland Heights, Ohio. About a week later I received a letter from the national AIA Executive Vice-President that stated the AIA would not fund my study… a few days later the Chairman of the School of Architecture called me into his office to inform that my independent study would be stopped, but he gave me a 5-hour credit with an ‘A’ for work completed. The internal funding request had just been signed by my three advisors and the Chairman, but was not yet submitted to the university administration for its review and approval. In my opinion the AIA did not want the marketing know-how information promulgated to the architectural community.
I did not protest – I was a graduate student who wanted to earn his degree. During the fall quarter of 1975, my last before I had earned my Master of Architecture, one of my stopped independent study advisors had become ill – the president of the ASO. The Chairman of the School of Architecture asked if I would alone without supervision take over his graduate level Professional Practice course. I agreed and completed the course that had included my review and to determine grades of the graduate students mid-terms and final papers.
I had to submit grades for all of my graduate students the week after I had received my Master of Architecture degree. I had cleaned out my Columbus apartment and moved all of my personal belongings back to Cleveland. I returned the night before I had to turn in grades and got a room at the Ohio Stater hotel. About 3:00 a.m. a tall thin man in a ski mask broke into my first floor room through a window. He woke me when he stepped on the bed to steady himself as he had entered. I knew how to defend myself and attacked him… he stumbled out of the same window he had broken into. In the morning, I turned in the grades to the university and later in the day met for a scheduled meeting in the home of my former advisor who had been the president of the ASO.
I wound up working for one of the Cleveland architectural firms where I had been employed while I had earned my MBA. In December 1976 I sat for my Ohio and national architectural licensing exam. I did not pass one of the four parts of the national exam by two percentage points. During my follow-up research I found on file at the State Board of Examiners of Architects a recommendation from my former advisor who was then the previous president of the ASO – it said I was “Regarded as one of the top students overall to graduate from Ohio State University,” and “This man is highly qualified to be brilliant in the profession. The potential is all there.” I met with the State Board of Examiners board of directors – a very intimidating and humbling experience – was made to feel very small.
Again, I did not pass the exam the next year, but this time I had learned all of my exams drawn in my own hand had been destroyed by the State Board of Examiners of Architects in violation of Ohio statues. That’s when I hired an attorney to challenge – it had become clear that it had become a darned if you do and darned if you don’t situation. I didn’t want to walk away – too much knowledge to share with the profession and society.
I applied for a license without examination under the Ohio Revised Code (ORC) section 4703.08 part A. I had met all of the criteria, but the State Board of Examiners after a lengthy hearing where they were represented by an Assistant Attorney General said NO! The Board claimed that the statute I had applied under was a grandfather clause and not even one architect was licensed in Ohio under the statue. It was not! The actual grandfather clause expired in 1932 and the statue I had applied under was revised by the Ohio Legislature twice in the 1960s and another time in the 1970s. The Board worked with the Ohio Legislature to have ORC 4703.08 part A removed as an emergency measure. I fought that with the support of the Wisconsin and California architectural licensing boards. The day after the law was signed by the Governor, after a request by the then Ohio Senate President Pro-tem, the Secretary of the State Board of Examiners released a list of approximately 350 architects that had been licensed under ORC 4703.08 part A. Do you recall the movie “Tucker: The Man and His Dream?”
However, I realized early on that a battle of this magnitude would require multi-fronts to win. While my Ohio administrative and legal court battles progressed I had made contact with various national publications to try to take my battle public to become part of the public record. This led to a headline article titled “One Architect in Search of a License” for the National Center for the Study of Professions headquartered in Washington, D.C. – among others. This led to an invitation to speak on September 24, 1979 before the Subcommittee on Elementary, Secondary, and Vocational Education of the Committee on Education and Labor – United States House of Representatives – Ninety-Sixth Congress – Subcommittee on Elementary, Secondary, and Vocational Education and Labor, Washington. D.C. regarding: The Truth in Testing Act of 1979; and The Educational Testing Act of 1979.
A couple weeks before I had taken the national architect licensing exam for the last time in December, 1979, I met to discuss the upcoming national architect licensing exam with the then Director of the Ohio State University School of Architecture. The then Director, of Japanese descent, did not want to discuss the exam – instead, he told me about his life as a child when he and his teacher parents had been sent to a United States internment camp during World War II. He told me that he understood prejudice and that was the reason I was having trouble passing the exam. He stated that I should not worry and that for sure I would pass the exam on my next attempt – which I did with one of the higher national scores. Shortly after, I was invited to appear on the TV program 20/20, but I decided to pass in an attempt to move on.
Approximately two years later, the national architects licensing exam was removed and replaced and a more valid internship program had been established – to my understanding based on a consent decree with the Justice Department and/or the Federal Trade Commission.
In 2008 I released a novel named GateKEEPERS I coauthored with a retired University of Michigan professor that tells the story of my saga to earn my license to practice architecture. The website for the book can be found at www.domarbooks-gatekeepers.com It’s available at many locations online. The novel is NOT the intent of this Indiegogo funding request.
This is my last hurrah. Without the capital not sure how I might become positioned to effectively share my warehouse of knowledge. With the cost of college today, not sure how many generations it might take to find a person with a similar education and experiences that loves to share that knowledge with society. Without the funding, I intend to utilize my knowledge and experience to help people buy and sell homes.

Truth is, it doesn't have to. On video below WSJ's Joanna Stern explains how Facebook really keeps tabs on you.  What if there was a social network without ads ? INTRODUCING   A powerful communication tool that provides users with an infinite range of possibilities on the same platform. Would you like to have your own radio station ? JUST IMAGINE!Create your own radio shows, have fun and also earn money with the help of sponsors and followers!  keep in touch with your friends ...even when you are not online  Turn all your likes to real-life benefits !  Genoma rewards is a rewards program, through which users can redeem their likes for real-life benefits. As in existent social networks, all user’s activity can be rated by the community with a like or a dislike. Each like gives the user, who published the information, a positive point and each dislike deducts a point. At the end of the day, the user can exchange all his points for coins of the rewards program.  To acquire a benefit, the beneficiary user must approach a sales point or a benefactor user to have his or her QR code scanned. At that moment, the system will transfer the amount of coins required to obtain the benefit from the beneficiary user’s account to the benefactor user's account.Benefactor users, in addition to attracting more customers to their businesses, can use these coins within Genoma as a form of payment or to obtain discounts on advertisements, premium packages, highlighted posts, etc. This way, we not only encourage users to share value, but also bring companies closer to their clients in a non-intrusive way. COINS
Each is worth 100 likes.
Do not have expiration date
Cannot be bought with money
Are non-transferable
Can be exchanged for benefits of the rewards program, or excepted as a form of payment within the site for advertising services, highlighting publications, premium packages, etc (for payments within the site, in some cases it can cover up to 100% of the cost and in other cases up to a maximum percentage).
 USER'S BALANCE
The user has three types of assets: Likes, Coins and Cash
The cash will not be affected by the ratings of the posts (if the user obtains only dislikes, this will not deduct money from the account in cash).
The minimum amount for likes and coins is zero.
If upon reaching zero likes and zero coins, the user continues to gain dislikes in his or her publications, this will not generate negative balances. As soon as the user starts receiving likes, he or she will start increasing the balance again.
If the user reaches zero likes and continues to gain dislikes in publications, given that he or she has coins in the balance, these coins start changing to likes to cover the negative balance. Each coin will become 100 likes again.
 We return the control over the information to those it really belongs to: the users! Nobody will generate deceptive content to get likes anymore, because users now have a powerful tool to express their displeasure. If somebody posts deceptive content, they will lose all their coins and will have to start from scratch.   INVESTMENT DETAILS  AWS prices details These are virtual servers.

<p><b>What is Sidekik?</b></p>
<p>Sidekik
is a mobile application under development which will perform two key actions
simultaneously. One, Sidekik will activate your smartphone's audio
and video recording devices and begin streaming the data to a secure
facility. Two, Sidekik will initiate a video call and connect you
with an attorney who will represent you in whatever situation you
find yourself.</p>
<p><b>Why is Sidekik
Important?</b></p>
<p>When
you are in a critical situation, such as being pulled over by law
enforcement, the balance of power is often against you. The fact is
that most people don't know their rights or how to enforce them. In
addition, without a record of your encounter with law enforcement,
the question of what happened during the encounter devolves into your
word against that of the officer, which normally results with courts
and public opinion in favor of the officer, regardless of what
actually occurred. Though many people have begun recording their
interactions with law enforcement, the recording is stored on the
recording device, which is sometimes confiscated.</p>
<p>Sidekik will solve both of these problems. With the activation of the Sidekik app,
your smartphone's audio and video recorders will begin
streaming to a secure server. If the officer has behaved
outside of their bounds and doesn't want evidence of that misconduct
available to you, there is simply nothing the officer can do. The
audio and video has been stored and
timestamped securely, and can be retrieved by you at your
convenience.</p>
<p>Within
seconds of activating the Sidekik app, you will be connected through
a video call to an attorney licensed to practice law in your
jurisdiction. Every attorney on the Sidekik network will be well
versed regarding your rights during a police encounter and do
everything in their power to defend your rights as they interact with
the officer on your behalf.</p>
<p>Sidekik
is important because it restores balance to a previously unequal
interaction. Your rights are worth preserving; all it takes is the
tap of a screen.</p>
<p><b>What we need and what
you get</b></p>
<p>Our
crowdfunding campaign has a goal of $130,000. Almost all of this funding
will go toward the creation of the Sidekik app, attorney software,
and website, which will communicate with each other to provide a
seamless Sidekik product for you. There are already apps for
streaming video and even apps for notifying your attorney that you
need assistance. However, nothing has come close to combining
audio/video streaming with video call technology as well as high-end
security measures to keep your data protected. This combination of
features is complex. We have partnered with
one of the top software design firms in the United States, Zco Corporation, to
create this leap forward in app sophistication. The first phase of app development has already been completed using the capital raised in SIdekik's previous Indiegogo campaign. The first phase included technical feasibility studies, technical planning, wireframing, graphics, and initial coding, among many other necessities before full-time coding (second phase) can begin.<br/></p>
<p>The
remainder of the funds will be used to set up an office with our own computer server, pay for essential legal services, and cover expenses while we
work with Zco during Sidekik development.</p>
<p>With
your help we will make Sidekik a reality and provide a powerful tool
for people to protect their rights.</p>
<p><b>Perks</b></p>
<p>You will receive a number of uses of Sidekik for your 
contribution, with the number of uses varying depending on the size of 
the contribution. The months included in each perk will match the number
 of Sidekik uses. For example, if you contribute $10 you will receive a 
three month subscription with three uses of Sidekik, while a $100 
contribution is good for a three year subscription with thirty-six uses 
of Sidekik. The subscription times can be split among different people. For example, The Judge is $100 and gets you a three year subscription to Sidekik, which you can separate into multiple subscriptions, such as three one year subscriptions.  <br/></p>

the way we interact with law enforcement has led Jesse to join Sidekik</span><span>.<br/><br/><p><b>FAQ</b></p>
<p><b>Is it legal to film
police?</b></p>
<p>Yes. There are slight differences from State to State, yet the 
fundamental right to film police in the public performance of their 
duties remains the same. This issue has been settled by numerous court 
rulings over the years,
such as <i>Glik
v. Cunniffe</i>,
<i>Smith
v. Cummings</i>,
<i>ACLU
v. Alvarez</i>, <i>Carla Gericke v. Gregory C. Begin et al.</i>
and several others. Additionally the U.S. Department of Justice has
issued strongly worded opinions in support of the right to record
police officers while they are in the public performance of their
duties. </p>
<p><span>As long as the police are in public and you are not
interfering with their activities, you can record them. If the police
in question are interacting with you, then you can also record them.
Just as the police have the right to record their interactions with
the public using dashcams and lapel cams, you have the right to
record them. <br/></span></p>
<p><b>Since we're not attorneys, here's the required disclaimer: The information on this profile page is for informational
purposes only and not for the purpose of providing legal advice. </b></p>
<p><b>Can I use Sidekik for something other than a traffic stop?</b></p>
<p>Absolutely.
 Sidekik can be used for situations ranging from encounters with law 
enforcement to Child Protective Services, regardless of whether you're 
in your vehicle, your house, or standing on a sidewalk.</p>
<p><b>Can I use Sidekik anywhere in the United States?</b></p>
<p>Yes.
 The attorney network will be composed of licensed attorneys in every 
state, with enough attorneys that every use of the video call feature in
 every state will be answered promptly. 
</p>
<p><b>What
if my smartphone's connection drops while I'm using Sidekik?</b></p>
<p>
If your carrier, for example Verizon, has an
interruption of service, then Sidekik will automatically connect with
any other available carrier such as Sprint or AT&amp;T. In the
extremely rare instance in which there is no available service with
any carrier, then the attorney video call will be unavailable.
However, Sidekik will still activate your smartphone's  audio/video
recording and store to your smartphone's onboard memory, unless you
have a bluetooth-enabled storage device in your vehicle or on your
person, in which case the data will be stored on said device. The 
chances of there being no coverage from any mobile service provider is 
extremely low.
</p>
<p><b>Does my
subscription fee cover the cost of attorney representation through
Sidekik?</b></p>
<p>Yes.
There is no additional cost to you for receiving representation
through the Sidekik attorney network. When you have need of legal
representation, just activate Sidekik and let your attorney do the
talking. There is no charge aside from your subscription fee. </p>
<p><b>Why would an attorney take my call without being paid?</b></p>
<p>Attorneys
 pay anywhere from $50 - $200 for a single client lead. A client lead is
 someone who has entered some basic information on a legal lead 
generation website and asked to be contacted. The quality of the leads 
varies greatly but is still an effective means by which an attorney can 
increase their client base. When viewed from this perspective, Sidekik 
is a lead generation goldmine for attorneys. The vast majority of calls 
an attorney takes through Sidekik will be people who actively need legal
 representation at the time of the call, making each call a lead of the 
highest quality for an attorney. When Sidekik is released, it will be 
one of the best means by which an attorney can build their client base 
and construct lawsuits. Charging for taking calls would alienate 
potential clients and be prohibitive, effectively negating the lead 
generation business model, which is why attorneys do not charge for the 
initial video call and representation.</p>
<p><b>Will the attorneys work for Sidekik? Is Sidekik a law firm?</b></p>
<p>The
 attorneys will not be employed by Sidekik and Sidekik is not a law 
firm, just as AAA is not a tow truck company. Sidekik will serve as the 
means by which individuals needing legal representation and attorneys 
needing clients can be connected, in real-time. </p>
<p><b>Will Sidekik be able to help stop the encroaching police state?</b></p>
<p>Sidekik
 deals with the issue of the police state on two levels: individually 
and communally. Individually, using Sidekik can help prevent you from 
having your rights violated during encounters with agents of the State 
by providing the means by which an attorney can represent you and defend
 your rights during the encounter, while at the same time acting as a 
de-escalating force in the situation. </p>
<p>On a communal level, 
the combined use of Sidekik by the public will bring to bear the only 
tool which has proven to alter the behavior of the police; money. A good
 example is that of Maywood, California. In early June of 2010 the City 
of Maywood was informed by their insurance carrier that their coverage 
was being canceled. The cancellation notice cited several reasons, but 
primarily it was due to the high number of claims filed against the 
police department. From the insurer's point of view, continuing to cover
 the city and pay claims settlements was too risky. The city tried 
finding another insurer but due to the high number of claims, no 
insurance company would provide coverage. As Councilman Felipe Aguirre 
said, ""Nobody will insure us, not as long as we have the police 
department."" Since cities require insurance to legally operate, and no 
one would provide coverage given the number claims against the police, 
the entire 60 member department was disbanded on June 30th, 2010. </p>
<p>Sidekik
 will streamline the formation of lawsuits against police departments by
 ensuring that evidence of rights violations is preserved and by 
providing a steady flow of attorneys willing to file lawsuits based on 
that evidence. In short, when the use of Sidekik becomes widespread, 
police departments will have two choices: change the way they do 
business or go out of business.</p>
<p><b>How will you ensure that my activation of the Sidekik app results in an attorney answering every time?</b></p>
<p>Upon
 activation and request for legal representation, the Sidekik system 
will call a number of attorneys on the Sidekik network who are nearest 
to you in the legal jurisdiction from which you activate the app. 
Whichever attorney answers first will represent you. If no attorneys 
take the call within a couple seconds then the system will contact the next
 group of attorneys by distance within your State and so on. Somewhere 
in the State where you are located an attorney will take your video call
 in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p><b>What if I already have an attorney and want him/her to represent me when using Sidekik?</b></p>
<p>Each
 subscriber will have the option of listing as many particular attorneys
 as they want and in whichever order they want them to be contacted when
 the subscriber uses Sidekik.</p>
<p><b>How much will you
charge for a subscription to Sidekik?</b></p>
<p>The
cost is not set yet, however, based on our projections to date we
predict a yearly subscription fee of $60, or $5/month.<br/></p>
<p><b>How many uses of Sidekik will I get for my subscription?</b></p>
<p>A
 yearly subscription allows for 12 uses of Sidekik in that time period. 
Additional uses can be added with a slight increase in the subscription 
fee. </p>
<p><b>What if I just want to use the audio/video streaming aspect of Sidekik without attorney representation?</b></p>
<p>When
 you first tap the Sidekik icon on your smartphone you will be presented
 with two options: audio/video streaming only or audio/video streaming 
with legal representation. If you choose data streaming only and decide 
later that you want legal representation as well, there will be an icon 
on your screen you can tap which will initiate a video call to an 
attorney. If you are being legally represented and decide you only want 
data streaming, you can drop the video call and keep the audio/video 
stream uninterrupted. <br/></p>

<p><b>What if I'm being represented by an attorney while using Sidekik but I think the attorney is doing an insufficient job?</b></p>
<p>If
 at any point during your legal representation you feel a different 
attorney is needed, you can tap an icon which will initiate another call that will connect you with a separate 
attorney. Your audio/video stream will be uninterrupted. <br/></p>

What is Sidekik?
Sidekik
is a mobile application under development which will perform two key actions
simultaneously. One, Sidekik will activate your smartphone's audio
and video recording devices and begin streaming the data to a secure
facility. Two, Sidekik will initiate a video call and connect you
with an attorney who will represent you in whatever situation you
find yourself.
Why is Sidekik
Important?
When
you are in a critical situation, such as being pulled over by law
enforcement, the balance of power is often against you. The fact is
that most people don't know their rights or how to enforce them. In
addition, without a record of your encounter with law enforcement,
the question of what happened during the encounter devolves into your
word against that of the officer, which normally results with courts
and public opinion in favor of the officer, regardless of what
actually occurred. Though many people have begun recording their
interactions with law enforcement, the recording is stored on the
recording device, which is sometimes confiscated.
Sidekik will solve both of these problems. With the activation of the Sidekik app,
your smartphone's audio and video recorders will begin
streaming to a secure server. If the officer has behaved
outside of their bounds and doesn't want evidence of that misconduct
available to you, there is simply nothing the officer can do. The
audio and video has been stored and
timestamped securely, and can be retrieved by you at your
convenience.
Within
seconds of activating the Sidekik app, you will be connected through
a video call to an attorney licensed to practice law in your
jurisdiction. Every attorney on the Sidekik network will be well
versed regarding your rights during a police encounter and do
everything in their power to defend your rights as they interact with
the officer on your behalf.
Sidekik
is important because it restores balance to a previously unequal
interaction. Your rights are worth preserving; all it takes is the
tap of a screen.
What we need and what
you get
Our
crowdfunding campaign has a goal of $130,000. Almost all of this funding
will go toward the creation of the Sidekik app, attorney software,
and website, which will communicate with each other to provide a
seamless Sidekik product for you. There are already apps for
streaming video and even apps for notifying your attorney that you
need assistance. However, nothing has come close to combining
audio/video streaming with video call technology as well as high-end
security measures to keep your data protected. This combination of
features is complex. We have partnered with
one of the top software design firms in the United States, Zco Corporation, to
create this leap forward in app sophistication. The first phase of app development has already been completed using the capital raised in SIdekik's previous Indiegogo campaign. The first phase included technical feasibility studies, technical planning, wireframing, graphics, and initial coding, among many other necessities before full-time coding (second phase) can begin.
The
remainder of the funds will be used to set up an office with our own computer server, pay for essential legal services, and cover expenses while we
work with Zco during Sidekik development.
With
your help we will make Sidekik a reality and provide a powerful tool
for people to protect their rights.
Perks
You will receive a number of uses of Sidekik for your 
contribution, with the number of uses varying depending on the size of 
the contribution. The months included in each perk will match the number
 of Sidekik uses. For example, if you contribute $10 you will receive a 
three month subscription with three uses of Sidekik, while a $100 
contribution is good for a three year subscription with thirty-six uses 
of Sidekik. The subscription times can be split among different people. For example, The Judge is $100 and gets you a three year subscription to Sidekik, which you can separate into multiple subscriptions, such as three one year subscriptions.  
The Sidekik TeamOrion Martin, FounderOrion
 spent three years in the U.S. Army. After his military involvement, 
Orion obtained his real estate license and worked as a loan officer in 
Silicon Valley. Research and personal experience prompted Orion to find a
 remedy to the burgeoning police state, which led to the formation of 
Sidekik.

Conferencing support and engineering. Most recently, he’s been 
consulting for a private hospital chain in the Los Angeles area, but has
 also been employed as a contractor by both Facebook and Google. A 
strong belief that our public servants should be held accountable for 
their actions and a desire to build something that will revolutionize 
the way we interact with law enforcement has led Jesse to join Sidekik.FAQ
Is it legal to film
police?
Yes. There are slight differences from State to State, yet the 
fundamental right to film police in the public performance of their 
duties remains the same. This issue has been settled by numerous court 
rulings over the years,
such as Glik
v. Cunniffe,
Smith
v. Cummings,
ACLU
v. Alvarez, Carla Gericke v. Gregory C. Begin et al.
and several others. Additionally the U.S. Department of Justice has
issued strongly worded opinions in support of the right to record
police officers while they are in the public performance of their
duties. 
As long as the police are in public and you are not
interfering with their activities, you can record them. If the police
in question are interacting with you, then you can also record them.
Just as the police have the right to record their interactions with
the public using dashcams and lapel cams, you have the right to
record them. 
Since we're not attorneys, here's the required disclaimer: The information on this profile page is for informational
purposes only and not for the purpose of providing legal advice. 
Can I use Sidekik for something other than a traffic stop?
Absolutely.
 Sidekik can be used for situations ranging from encounters with law 
enforcement to Child Protective Services, regardless of whether you're 
in your vehicle, your house, or standing on a sidewalk.
Can I use Sidekik anywhere in the United States?
Yes.
 The attorney network will be composed of licensed attorneys in every 
state, with enough attorneys that every use of the video call feature in
 every state will be answered promptly. 

What
if my smartphone's connection drops while I'm using Sidekik?

If your carrier, for example Verizon, has an
interruption of service, then Sidekik will automatically connect with
any other available carrier such as Sprint or AT&T. In the
extremely rare instance in which there is no available service with
any carrier, then the attorney video call will be unavailable.
However, Sidekik will still activate your smartphone's  audio/video
recording and store to your smartphone's onboard memory, unless you
have a bluetooth-enabled storage device in your vehicle or on your
person, in which case the data will be stored on said device. The 
chances of there being no coverage from any mobile service provider is 
extremely low.

Does my
subscription fee cover the cost of attorney representation through
Sidekik?
Yes.
There is no additional cost to you for receiving representation
through the Sidekik attorney network. When you have need of legal
representation, just activate Sidekik and let your attorney do the
talking. There is no charge aside from your subscription fee. 
Why would an attorney take my call without being paid?
Attorneys
 pay anywhere from $50 - $200 for a single client lead. A client lead is
 someone who has entered some basic information on a legal lead 
generation website and asked to be contacted. The quality of the leads 
varies greatly but is still an effective means by which an attorney can 
increase their client base. When viewed from this perspective, Sidekik 
is a lead generation goldmine for attorneys. The vast majority of calls 
an attorney takes through Sidekik will be people who actively need legal
 representation at the time of the call, making each call a lead of the 
highest quality for an attorney. When Sidekik is released, it will be 
one of the best means by which an attorney can build their client base 
and construct lawsuits. Charging for taking calls would alienate 
potential clients and be prohibitive, effectively negating the lead 
generation business model, which is why attorneys do not charge for the 
initial video call and representation.
Will the attorneys work for Sidekik? Is Sidekik a law firm?
The
 attorneys will not be employed by Sidekik and Sidekik is not a law 
firm, just as AAA is not a tow truck company. Sidekik will serve as the 
means by which individuals needing legal representation and attorneys 
needing clients can be connected, in real-time. 
Will Sidekik be able to help stop the encroaching police state?
Sidekik
 deals with the issue of the police state on two levels: individually 
and communally. Individually, using Sidekik can help prevent you from 
having your rights violated during encounters with agents of the State 
by providing the means by which an attorney can represent you and defend
 your rights during the encounter, while at the same time acting as a 
de-escalating force in the situation. 
On a communal level, 
the combined use of Sidekik by the public will bring to bear the only 
tool which has proven to alter the behavior of the police; money. A good
 example is that of Maywood, California. In early June of 2010 the City 
of Maywood was informed by their insurance carrier that their coverage 
was being canceled. The cancellation notice cited several reasons, but 
primarily it was due to the high number of claims filed against the 
police department. From the insurer's point of view, continuing to cover
 the city and pay claims settlements was too risky. The city tried 
finding another insurer but due to the high number of claims, no 
insurance company would provide coverage. As Councilman Felipe Aguirre 
said, ""Nobody will insure us, not as long as we have the police 
department."" Since cities require insurance to legally operate, and no 
one would provide coverage given the number claims against the police, 
the entire 60 member department was disbanded on June 30th, 2010. 
Sidekik
 will streamline the formation of lawsuits against police departments by
 ensuring that evidence of rights violations is preserved and by 
providing a steady flow of attorneys willing to file lawsuits based on 
that evidence. In short, when the use of Sidekik becomes widespread, 
police departments will have two choices: change the way they do 
business or go out of business.
How will you ensure that my activation of the Sidekik app results in an attorney answering every time?
Upon
 activation and request for legal representation, the Sidekik system 
will call a number of attorneys on the Sidekik network who are nearest 
to you in the legal jurisdiction from which you activate the app. 
Whichever attorney answers first will represent you. If no attorneys 
take the call within a couple seconds then the system will contact the next
 group of attorneys by distance within your State and so on. Somewhere 
in the State where you are located an attorney will take your video call
 in a matter of seconds.
What if I already have an attorney and want him/her to represent me when using Sidekik?
Each
 subscriber will have the option of listing as many particular attorneys
 as they want and in whichever order they want them to be contacted when
 the subscriber uses Sidekik.
How much will you
charge for a subscription to Sidekik?
The
cost is not set yet, however, based on our projections to date we
predict a yearly subscription fee of $60, or $5/month.
How many uses of Sidekik will I get for my subscription?
A
 yearly subscription allows for 12 uses of Sidekik in that time period. 
Additional uses can be added with a slight increase in the subscription 
fee. 
What if I just want to use the audio/video streaming aspect of Sidekik without attorney representation?
When
 you first tap the Sidekik icon on your smartphone you will be presented
 with two options: audio/video streaming only or audio/video streaming 
with legal representation. If you choose data streaming only and decide 
later that you want legal representation as well, there will be an icon 
on your screen you can tap which will initiate a video call to an 
attorney. If you are being legally represented and decide you only want 
data streaming, you can drop the video call and keep the audio/video 
stream uninterrupted. 

                
What if I'm being represented by an attorney while using Sidekik but I think the attorney is doing an insufficient job?
If
 at any point during your legal representation you feel a different 
attorney is needed, you can tap an icon which will initiate another call that will connect you with a separate 
attorney. Your audio/video stream will be uninterrupted. 

Will the Sidekik app be
free to download?
Yes,
the app will be free to download for both iPhone and Android.
Can I still use Sidekik if I download the app but don't pay for a subscription?
The free version of Sidekik will allow for streaming and secure storage of audio/video data. The subscription allows for connection with an attorney. We want people to be able to have access to an attorney whether they have a subscription or not, which will be accomplished by offering a pay-as-you-go option. The cost will be a higher than getting a subscription, but the app user will still have access to legal representation if they need it.
Where will Sidekik have it's office?

that State which is in good standing. The members of the Sidekik 
team are currently living in California while building the Indiegogo

<b>**We’re thrilled to be partnering with Slow Food USA!

<h3>
<b>Why BE matters: </b><br/>
</h3>
<p>The BE app is about empowerment. <br/></p>
<p>It’s about finding solutions to some of today’s major, interconnected problems: the existence of food deserts, where nutritious food is either unavailable or unaffordable; a lack of resilience in the food system as a whole; a lack of knowledge about sustainable gardening and native plants; the high expense of traditional permaculture classes; and disappearing habitat, food sources, and larval hosts for bees, butterflies, and other wildlife. <br/></p>
<p>More to the point - it’s about giving people the tools they need to create those solutions in their own homes and neighborhoods. It’s about empowering people to BE the change.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439612262/txqddz9siqfpndu1hsl4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Permaculture (permanent agriculture) is a form of sustainable agriculture that is good for the planet (helps with rainwater retention, works within existing ecosystems), good for wildlife (provides sources of shelter, food, nesting, and larval hosting), and good for people (creates something beautiful that is also useful and, if done right, requires significantly less maintenance than traditional landscaping). However, learning about it can involve expensive certifications or books not found in all libraries, and as a result, there’s a sort of exclusivity to the movement. <br/><p>By taking the best information available about permaculture and sustainable gardening and condensing it into a free database, and by offering a tool that makes visualizing landscape designs so easy and affordable, the app breaks down the barriers of both cost and information. This means ANYONE with a mobile device can become a permaculture expert and create their own resilient yard, school or community garden, or green space with confidence. <br/></p>

</div></div>","BE - The Food Empowerment App
Formerly called Farm and Garden, the name BE was taken from Gandhi's ""Be the change you wish to see in the world,"" and is about putting crucial information into the world's hands… for free. 

What BE is: 

Part 1: A free database of plants native to the temperate United States, along with herbs, medicinal plants, wild edibles, vegetables, and fruits
Explanation of best planting practices to allow each plant to flourish:
Moisture, sun, and climate requirements
Polyculture (pest reduction)
Companion planting
 Soil amending tips 
Medicinal and edible benefits of each plant
Benefits to wildlife, including Butterfly Host Statistics
Part 2: A photo-based landscape design tool that, together with the database, will make it easy and inexpensive even a novice gardener to create beautiful, functional, and sustainable landscapes that are good for the planet, for wildlife, and for people.  
Just take a photo of your site and overlay the images of plants and other features from    our image database to quickly and easily envision how you can turn your yard from this: 



Into this, in just minutes: 

**We’re thrilled to be partnering with Slow Food USA! We will be donating both the plant database and the design tool to the nearly 600 locations of their School Garden Program, assisting their efforts to bring food knowledge to the next generation.**We also have exciting stretch goals (which you can check out below!), including the creation of a green jobs sharing network and the translation of the database so it can be used internationally. 

Why BE matters: 

The BE app is about empowerment. 
It’s about finding solutions to some of today’s major, interconnected problems: the existence of food deserts, where nutritious food is either unavailable or unaffordable; a lack of resilience in the food system as a whole; a lack of knowledge about sustainable gardening and native plants; the high expense of traditional permaculture classes; and disappearing habitat, food sources, and larval hosts for bees, butterflies, and other wildlife. 
More to the point - it’s about giving people the tools they need to create those solutions in their own homes and neighborhoods. It’s about empowering people to BE the change.

Permaculture (permanent agriculture) is a form of sustainable agriculture that is good for the planet (helps with rainwater retention, works within existing ecosystems), good for wildlife (provides sources of shelter, food, nesting, and larval hosting), and good for people (creates something beautiful that is also useful and, if done right, requires significantly less maintenance than traditional landscaping). However, learning about it can involve expensive certifications or books not found in all libraries, and as a result, there’s a sort of exclusivity to the movement. By taking the best information available about permaculture and sustainable gardening and condensing it into a free database, and by offering a tool that makes visualizing landscape designs so easy and affordable, the app breaks down the barriers of both cost and information. This means ANYONE with a mobile device can become a permaculture expert and create their own resilient yard, school or community garden, or green space with confidence. 



What We Need & What You Get

The app is being built as you read this. But we need help to make this FREE as a database, affordable as design, and to donate to Slow Food USA to help grow and sustain local, healthy food.

Who's Talking About This? 


Doug Tallamy - Professor/Researcher, Author, Speaker

""We will not save what we do not know or recognize. A mobile app that 
facilitates recognition of native plants will be an important tool for 
both preserving and restoring the natural world.""
Chelsea Bay Dennis - The Conscious Entrepreneur, Founder
""I am a lover and supporter of local food and native plants, but 
certainly not very knowledgeable about making my own backyard a success. 
I'm so excited to check out this app to simplify the idea of gardening, 
make it accessible in my busy schedule and to feel empowered to create 
an abundant yard. Perennial Harvest is such a great pioneer for creating
 opportunities for growing food and getting your hands in the dirt.""
Laura Bowne - GIS Developer, Maryland Dept. of Natural Resources

""I think it would 
be a fantastic resource for the average homeowner, professional 
landscapers, and master gardeners.  Folks need this kind of catalog in 
the palm of their hand.""
Brad Kik - Institute For Sustainable Living, Art, + Natural Design - Co-Founder
""One of the stickiest sticking points in implementing permaculture is 
that too many of us never took a field botany course. There are tens of 
thousands of amazing plants out there but the knowledge of how to use 
them well just isn’t in our brains. A mobile design tool with a database
 of essential plants helps ease the transition from untutored enthusiast
 to serious practitioner.""
Nicki Sandberg - Peace Corps 2009-2011, Honduras; GIS Professional

""Permaculture is a rapidly growing trend being embraced in all types of 
communities as a way to improve food security and build sustainable 
local food systems. Finding the right location, plants, and plan for 
getting a project started can take significant resources and is often a 
barrier to success. In low resource areas, there is a special need for 
tools that are easy to understand and use. As a practitioner in planning
 and food systems, and a Returned Peace Corps Volunteer, I see many 
applications for this tool to enable community groups, nonprofits, and 
schools locally and abroad to jumpstart their permaculture projects. 
Using mobile technology, which is now widespread even in rural 
international locations, groups can quickly and easily plan projects and
 get stakeholder buy-in. Ultimately, projects that are more sustainable 
and better implemented will provide more lasting and meaningful 
improvements to food systems.""

<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>Project Shard is a transparent display designed to be outfitted for your computer case side panel. This project allows you to view your beautiful computer and internals whilst allowing you to customize what you display on your side panel, may it be your favorite anime, artistic designs, Discord chat status or even live results such as computer temps or twitch notifications. </p>
<p>Project Shard aims to hit the mass majority of today's cases outfitting them with customized displays to fit seamlessly with every side panel that works easily with your computer. Project Shard will run on SATA power and an HDMI input (included with product). Therefore, all internals such as power for the display and built in LEDs are all controlled via a simple box that fits easily inside a hard drive bay, hence the convenience of SATA power. Simply slide on your new panel display, connect it to the Shard power supply located and mounted in your hard drive bay, connect in two cables and you're up and running!</p>
<p>The display runs full RGB allowing you to display a wide range of colors throughout your screen despite what you have inside. High contrast built in LEDs allow your internals to be any color, but allowing deep and rich colors all throughout the display, even pitch black colors, block out light, or choose to see all the glory inside your  computer with many more colors. </p>
<h3>What does it work with?</h3>
<p>Physically, the Project Shard side panel aims to work on only a SATA power connector and an HDMI cable which can easily pass through to your graphics card. </p>
<p>Project Shard will also be taking a survey for the top 5 computer cases out there that desire such a bespoke product outfitted perfectly for their current computer case, eliminating the need to buy an entire case and change out computer parts.  </p>
<p>On the software side, Project Shard works simply like many displays, thus allowing you to easily add widgets and full videos, or animations and free adjustments such as putting laying kittens sitting on top of your graphics card or make it look like your computer is filling up with water! </p>
<h3>Short Story Summary</h3>
<p>Probably unlike most campaigns this one started with nothing! No funding and no team to help bring this idea to light. Sure, the idea can be seen in fancy companies today that can easily do what I’ve done such as LG. But as a PC gamer myself I felt the need to strive into even more ways to customize what a computer is today. Why focus on just a few LEDs to make a computer case look fancy when I could focus on an image of many pixels displayed on my computer but still let me enjoy the internals of my beloved computer? </p>
<p>While saving up and working alone to figure out how I can make this product come to life I have developed my first prototype, which still amazes me every time I look at it, see how elegant it is, and how it has come to be just what I imagined!</p>
<p>But, I didn’t want to stop there with my personal experience. I knew that this idea was important to me, and that my family and friends were amazed to see a floating image and what is behind it!  I wanted to give this opportunity to everyone. I wanted to be able to allow people to customize their computers to the max level possible with ease, simplicity, and way more affordability. Some companies out there have similar projects, but like all major companies they come with a hefty, unnecessary price tags that no gamer would pay for. Did I mention they don’t sell these separately, that they only have one case and that it all costs over $4,000? I thought it was about time i reached out to as many people as possible, their case and their budget. </p>
<p>Overall, I’m just one person with a dream, and it’s a struggle.  I am determined to push this idea forward and work with others who see its potential for innovation as much as I do.   What I need is a lot – funding, inspiration, and help to keep working on making Project Shard a full product.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The price tag to start it off is a big one even for a product that I aim to be as affordable as possible. I want everyone to enjoy the creativity this product has to offer.</p>
<p>At the moment I’m still in the prototyping phase and can’t make any promises about what you might get in return. But what I can promise is my hard work and commitment to carry out this project with whatever funding I can get, and  my determination that it will fly! Then I can offer free side panels to my top/first supporters! Later on I will aim for pre-order discounts as well as early bird deals.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>One of the biggest things I want to fight is the price tag. Cutting out an un-necessary corporate price tag for something so small but so big. I want to give everyone the chance to experience the excitement I have and open this new window into your computer. It’s time to take a stand against high prices for such a simple thing and offer it to more than one group. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>At the moment my prototype has taken a dip. If you take a look at the images in my campaign you may notice the top right has a crack. Rest assured, this was a simple malfunction to the important layer which allows color to pass through as it should. The issue is fixable and i hope to post an update on it soon!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Being without money but a big heart and an need to wanna help I can understand that some of you are like that as well, especially being on this website and reading this long thing for some reason instead of having a nice burger or movie. I’d love it if you would help me get the word out, repost this on Facebook, share it with any tech geeks out there, and chat with any PC gaming enthusiasts about whether and how it can work!</p>

English:
Learn, share and get the best for your pet.
We want to help people that own a pet and don’t have the knowledge needed for the right care they need. 
GeekPet will be a virtual platform that connects people who love their pets, for this to happen we will use a Q&A (questions and answers) platform so people can share their knowledge.

A web portal, developed by geeks for geeks that love animals, where we will provide all the necessary knowledge and products for you to take care and spoil your pet.
The idea was born from the experience of each member of the team, both Katia and Mauricio had problems that were complicated by the lack of knowledge and delay in finding the solution.
While Katia was trying to find information to take care of Odin (her paralyzed dog).Mauricio needed a gift for a pet and he didn’t know where or what to buy.
We realized that there was lack of knowledge from people about taking good care of their pets and pet specialized sites.To solve this problem:

We will create specialized content about pets, such as courses or virtual workshops and also we will create a community to share knowledge by solving doubts about their pets, we will provide information about discounts on products and services for the benefit of our community and we will offer innovative and original products for pets.
How we are gonna do this?
Creating a virtual platform that:
Helps to answer questions about your pet in collaboration with the community.
Offers courses and/or virtual workshops about taking care of your pet dictated by professionals.
Helps to find useful and original accessories for your pet.
In association with the best brands in the industry, offers discounts on products and services for the care of your pet.

Help us take forward this project.
Many pets are abandoned and/or abused by lack of knowledge of their owners, a project like GeekPet helps people to learn what they need to provide a better quality of life for their spoiled ones.
With your help we will achieve our dream and the dream of many people, that is to have their pets healthy and happy.
How can you help?

Through a donation though this platform (Indiegogo).  All donors will be mentioned in our Social Networks.

Español:
Aprende, comparte y consigue lo major para tu mascota.
Queremos ayudar a las personas que tienen mascotas y que no poseen el conocimiento necesario para el cuidado de estas.
GeekPet será una plataforma virtual que conecte a las personas que quieren a sus mascotas mediante el intercambio de preguntas y respuestas utilizando esta plataforma para el intercambio de este conocimiento. 
Un portal web hecho por geeks para geeks amantes de los animales donde brindaremos todo el conocimiento necesario y productos para que cuides y engrías a tu mascota.
La idea nace por la experiencia vivida de cada integrante del equipo, tanto Katia como Mauricio tuvieron problemas que se complicaron por falta de conocimiento y demora en encontrar la solución. 
Mientras Katia trataba de buscar información para el cuidado de Odín  (su perro paralítico).
Mauricio necesitaba el regalo para una mascota y no sabía dónde ni qué comprar.
Dándonos cuenta que existía una falta de conocimiento de las personas sobre el cuidado de sus mascotas y de sitios especializados para mascotas.Para solucionar este problema:

Crearemos contenido especializado en mascotas como cursos o talleres virtuales y a la vez formaremos una comunidad que compartirá sus conocimiento resolviendo dudas con respecto a sus mascotas, brindaremos información de descuentos de productos y servicios para el beneficio de nuestra comunidad y ofreceremos productos innovadores y originales para mascotas.

   The classical staff notation is not easy to learn for beginners.   It’s not intuitive to write, so you should sing the melody over and over to notate, and sometimes you forget the idea while dictating.   You can record your melodies, however, when you write down your music, it's easier to see and organize the whole structure of the piece.   There are so many people, even musicians saying they don’t know how to notate their own music.   Since I majored in music composition, I’ve always been thinking about this problem.   If there were more people who could write down their music, we could listen to more creative works, therefore, the music industry, and the arts could be improved more.   Then I realized that I had been writing my melodies with my own method when I was young and didn't know how to notate.   Like this!   These are 1. Beat, 2. Pitch name, 3. High and low   With this method, I designed the new music notebook that everyone can write down their melodies easily without learning.   Naturally, we can recognize the pitch: highness and lowness.   In SHOULARM notebook, you also write high notes on the upper part, low notes on the lower part of the paper.   We count beats in the flow of time.   The left to right flow of the paper is the length of the beat.   This is the same piece as the one above written on manuscript paper.    These two are notated the same melodies.    Now you know how to use SHOULARM.   Write down your melodies playing only inside your head.   Share your cool ideas with the world and spread the creative brilliant music!    You can notate many parts   (duet, trio, quartet, etc.) on the same page.    These are notated the same music. (Ravel - String quartet in f major 2nd. movement)    SHOULARM can be used in music education.   It's easy to recognize the gab between notes and how melody flows, therefore, it's easy to explain harmonics and how transpositions work.  3 ways to use SHOULARM      1.

We will customize each shipment based on your car model which is surveyed by individual message. *If you select the Silicon Refill Perk, you should choose whether it is for 28"" length blade or not.   1. Please check your wiper blade sizes 2. If the size of your blade is 28"", please choose a option [28""],  if the size of your blade is 26"" or shorter (24"", 22"", 21""...), please choose the option [26"" or less] (Between a 28"" and shorters are not compatible each other since the width of a 28"" silicon refill is 8 mm and the remaining 26"" or shorter are 6 mm width.)  KIMBLADE’s key feature is the direct blade that contacts the windshield glass. KIMBLADE uses a 4-bar linkage blade, made with silicone, that exceeds the performance of existing rubber blades through its powerful structure and high-quality materials. WHAT DO EXPERTS THINK ABOUT KIMLBADE?
 There are many advantages of using silicone to make wiper blades. One, it ensures smooth movement and two, it makes sure that the wiper is in constant contact with the glass to apply the water-repellent coating. 
 
 KIMBLADE wipers are made of silicone material that ensures smooth usability even in harsh sunlight and snow, as it is very stable against UV rays and ozone corrosion. The traditional rubber wiper is not resistant to harsh weather conditions such as strong sunlight, sub-zero weather, UV rays, and ozone, which causes cracks and increased corrosion over time.KIMBLADE wiper blades are made of silicone and remain intact even when exposed to various conditions, allowing users to experience utmost convenience and safety. 
 Water repellency is unique to KIMBLADE, as silicone oil and coating is applied with each wipe. Not only does this make driving safer in dangerous conditions, but now there is no need to purchase a separate water repellent for the windshield. This makes it extremely cost-effective and useful for all weather conditions. 
 
 
 When the wiper blade is in motion, the water repellent film is automatically applied onto the windshield glass (permanent use).
 
 
 KIMBLADE’s Silicone Wiper TechnologyThe silicone is a relatively soft material, so the other silicone blade in the market which has an inverted triangle structure is bent easily. And so, the downforce is not concentrated and as a result, friction is increased due to extensive contact with the surface of the windshield. KIMBLADE is supported by its 4-bar linkage structure to ensure the downforce is always concentrated on the edge of the wiper blade without breaking the lip to maximize clear visibility on the road. 
 
     
  At the end of the campaign, please choose the right size of your blades (Driver Side & Passenger Side) by our survey. Please refer to bellow our wiper blades specification database (this is standard selling in US market. If you live in other countries, it may be a different size or adapter type even the same year and model. Please check the correct sizes and wiper arm type before you finish the survey) tab button.
""Please use this data for reference only and check the right blade sizes and type of arm of your vehicle.""

<div>Space souvenirs should be fascinating objects that illuminate a child’s mind. And for some time after the 1960s, this was how things were. But today, when we step into a space souvenir shop options seem to be nothing more than toy models, badges, stationery, T-shirts and so on. Nothing seems to give children that awe and wonder anymore. Souvenirs are meant to be a meaningful and inspiring gadget that propel us into the future instead of being stereotypical images anchored to a bygone era. As an avid spaceflight enthusiast, Romax decided to do something innovative.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>In September 2015, Romax made a model of Saturn V for his girlfriend as a gift, which was then displayed in her house. Ever since then, people have been very intrigued about that model rocket.</div>

<p>Romax then completed a Falcon 9 rocket lamp on a large scale to celebrate the first successful return landing of SpaceX, which eventually became the prototype of PLUME afterwards.</p>

<p>He then added the AR function to the rocket lamp which received lots of attention from kids who’re curious about space. He then realized that it must be the perfect way to make space more appealing. Which would lead the way for spaceflight to one day become an integral part of daily life.</p>

</div></div>","PLUME is a smart, multifunctional rocket launch vehicle and speaker system, designed to mimic a rocket launch in both appearance and entertainment.Of all the sights ever witnessed by mankind, a rocket launch in operation is perhaps the most thrilling. Imaging the loud roaring sound coming from the engines, the massive bright light stuns in the air, the brilliant vapor clouds just beneath your feet… and even the voice commencing countdown of Space Shuttle.With its alloy CNC and 3D printing modeling, precise sound performance stimulation, and vivid build-in spotlights, PLUME features a powerful rocket launch show within your control.


We managed to offer 3 rockets which are reminiscent of the space exploration history. The Saturn V, Space Shuttle, and Falcon 9 launched on the famous LC39A site in 1967-1973, 1981-2011 and 2010-present.

The exquisitely accurate 1/300, 1/200, 1/150 scale reproductions are based on many specialized documents and data. During the design development, our team was able to cooperate with many rocket scientist that helped to make sure the overall appearance, as well as the launch escape system of Saturn V, Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) of the space shuttle and landing legs of Falcon9, are as accurate and detailed as possible. 

With the Fast Assemble Stable Technology (F.A.S.T.),  PLUME allows you to easily switch to a new rocket in a snap. 

With the attached PLUME base, F.A.S.T. can make the rocket model display individually.

You can also change each core engine to achieve better details.




People dream to watch a rocket launch. Did we mention that PLUME’s all system voice records are from a re-mastering of the actual Apollo missions, even Jack King, the “voice of Apollo”? 
Check this out 

Kinda cool, right?   
Of course, we won’t reveal all system sound effects here cause everybody hates spoiler.

We want even kids can learn spaceflight technologies easily and fast.


By adopting the Augmented Reality (AR) technology, you’ll be able to assemble the 3 rockets like an expert through the interactive “Space Go” app. Understand each detail of the rocket structure by simply pointing your smartphone camera at PLUME.

Choose even your own rocket, Fill up the propellant tank, set up the orbit, and you’re all set to go… oh, don’t forget to check the engines of course.




“Space nuts” wouldn’t ever want to miss a single rocket launch event just like football fans wouldn’t want to miss a match. The “Space Go” app automatically syncs up and updates the upcoming launch events and reminds you on time. All you need to do is to choose your favorite ones and simply tap the alarm button. Voila! 


 
PLUME is much more than just a rocket launch vehicle. It’s a smart lighting system that allows you to enjoy endless possibilities of lighting color and brightness by selecting from 16 million colors.


 PLUME adapts to anywhere in your house in perfect lighting conditions.

Four auxiliary spotlights surround the base with a unique optical-path design that not only lights up the rocket but also showcases the flame of the rocket in the best way.


Get so bored with your alarms and frustrated to get up early again this morning? PLUME has the coolest wake-up call for you! How about some lightning from Jupiter?  
Check out my alarm this week:

Weekend - Well, I’d choose to sleep till noon!

Still feel so asleep? No worries! Because PLUME can offer a sophisticate lighting-up effect (stimulate light of the Sun) 8 minutes before your wake-up time. 


PLUME can also be your premium Bluetooth speaker comes with all-channel sound effects that give unobstructed range up to 30 square feet.

The “Dances to the music” feature is really cool that it automatically adapts to the beat of your playlist and adjust the color, brightness and light rhythm. So, whether you want to jazz up a party with friends or play video games in an ultra-rich sound, PLUME is always there to support. 


Record a voice message, select a light color, set the time, and it’s all done in the “Space Go” app. PLUME brings love and joy to your family life. 


Yes, all features of PLUME can be simply executed by just tapping anywhere on the bottom of the dock. Thanks to our engineers who worked tirelessly to optimize the software and hardware.

 Double tap – on and off  
Single tap – switch light mode  
Tap and hold – adjust brightness

THE TEAM:            Empower’s co-founders: Joseph Truong, Vasiliki Belegrinis, Amal Naufer, and Akash Sidhu (left to right; Skaramagas Refugee Camp, Greece). Empower is a social enterprise created by four students from the Schulich School of Business, York University who are Global Finalists in the 2017 Hult Prize Challenge. The Hult Prize, often called ‘the Nobel Prize for students’ is the world’s largest social entrepreneurship competition that challenges students around the world to address a pressing global issue with a business sustainable solution. The winning idea receives $1,000,000 USD in seed capital funding. This year’s competition drew over 50,000 applicants and Empower is one of six Global Finalists who will be pitching in September at the United Nations HQ to kick-off UN Week.Recognizing that connecting to the internet gives people the power to transform their lives, we’ve been working since October 2016 on a software solution that can not only bring the internet offline for people living on the fringes of mobile networks, but also share the plethora of opportunities that come with this access of information.Let’s #empower the lives of many and give refugees the opportunities we take for granted everyday - the simple access to a wifi connection and overall world.     OUR PROGRESS:Empower in the Media:For media inquiries, please contact vasiliki@empower10.org.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

The projections for next 3-5 years have Gulsy being Global across the World! Are you ready to join us?  We recently engaged the Sheffield Marketing Group, an independent leader in the industry for over 20 years, who has worked with and helped develop several billion-dollar companies including Amway, Isagenix, Shaklee, among others, to work with our platform. They provided us with an independent analysis for projections and a worst-case scenario for our expansion model. We have included a summary of the analysis below.Over the last several years the consistent trend of successful IPOs (Initial Public Offering) and private start-ups were focused in the technology sector and specifically in Digital Platforms, such as: Uber, Lyft, Airbnb and others. The reasons for these trends are obvious due to the exponentially increasing reliance on technology in every part of our lives. The value of these platforms will only increase and become more and more of an everyday necessity.  ""I had the chance to invest in Uber in the early days and I passed it up — twice. My friends, Travis and Garrett, started the company, and I still didn't invest! The ride-sharing company started as a side hustle and they hired someone else to run it, so I didn't think they were going to make it.""""Had I invested $25,000 in Uber, like I did with many other companies, the value would have reached $300 million a few years ago. I regret not investing in the company, but I'm also glad the market punched me in the face. I deserved it — and I'm even more driven now because of it. That's why I grab every opportunity I can.""— Gary Vaynerchuk,founder and CEO of VaynerXfive-time New York Times bestselling author of ""Crushing It!""Mark Cuban also passed on investing in Uber early. Investors said Uber would never succeed outside of San Francisco, Los Angeles, and NYC. Now, they eat their words. Uber recently launched in Kenya, Africa and is in nearly 500 cities in over 75 countries. The investors didn't underestimate the idea, they underestimated the founders.The same happened with Brian Chesky, co-founder of Airbnb. Chesky received seven rejection letters from seven prominent VCs when Airbnb tried to raise $150,000 in exchange for 10% of the company. Airbnb is valued at $30 billion at the time of this writing. That $150,000 investment would have been worth $3 billion today. Chesky even published the rejection letters as motivation for other founders. Each individual Indiegogo contribution will boost Gulsy into reaching these estimated projections even faster. When Gulsy grows and expands, your Gulsy business will continue to grow faster & faster.

</h2>
</div>
<div><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: initial;""><p>Kindom™  has grown out of the personal journeys of Catherine Resnick and Gry Stene.</p>
<p>Cath and Gry met at a young and innovative local service group, Rotary of Crawley (ROC), in 2010.  It soon became apparent that they shared a passion, vision and a drive to make a difference. </p></span></div>

<p></p></span><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Cath’s interest in developmental differences began when her own children experienced challenges.  Desperately seeking solutions, she read and researched extensively, went from ‘expert to expert”, attended numerous parenting courses and support groups. Her interest in children’s development, didn’t end there.  She later founded a drop in centre for at-risk youth and trained as a psychotherapist.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: initial;""><span></span></span></p>
<p>“I have been stunned to discover that parents are still dealing with same challenges I met back in 1992 - and they don’t need to.”</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: initial;""><span>Gry came across it from a different angle. Her teenage dream was to become a doctor and work in Africa where she lived in her early teens. Her interest in science and technology  lead her to do a degree in the emerging  field of computer science, which she felt would be a more powerful enabler to fight inequality and poverty. Gry has always been involved with children and young people; as a big sister, mentor, foster carer and coach, and has had a hand in a number of initiatives aiming to empower and encourage those in need.<br/></span></span></p>

</h2>
<div>
<p><span>We’ve been researching for over a year now and our Kindom prototype testing clearly showed that most parents want to find the best pathways for their children. No surprises there. </span></p>
<p>But, parents told us they often didn't trust the information they were provided, they felt it wasn't relevant, or they didn't have a good way of collaborating with specialists where required.  </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Other key findings from usability testing of our prototype were that if it wasn't obvious how to do something, the users didn't do it. Comments we hear from target users are ""it has to be simple"", ""I need to be able to do it on the fly"", ""can you just make it work like my inbox"", ""I would like it to be like Facebook, but secure"".</span></p>
<p>That’s why we have designed Kindom™ to address these problems.  </p>

Your Child's Best Advocate

As a parent, you are your child's best advocate. Sometimes it can be daunting to try to find the best pathway for your child, especially if something is ""a little different"". Maybe you ask yourself questions like:
do you have all our records and files readily available?
where do you start looking for information and other resources? 
who do you need to see? do you need a specialist?
are there things you can do at home with your child?
how do you get your point across to the health and education professionals?
so you trust the specialist, but that doesn't really seem right? 
who else can you ask?
what do other parents know that you can use to support your child?

Kindom™ is designed to ensure that you have all the resources you need in one place so you can support your child through any challenges they may have or to give them an edge in their development.

Kindom™ is that digital personal assistant you have always wanted. 



We aim to bridge the gap and lag between research discoveries and parents to help ensure that your children get the support they deserve - as early as possible.

Kindom Features & Perks
Kindom™  is the 'all in one' parenting app. Check out the table below for an overview of features at each level (you can use this to select the Perks (headings) most relevant to you).




Kindom in The News


Helping our children should be easy!


We hear from parents that they often struggle to feel they have the resources they need to support their children effectively, have difficulty knowing where to begin, or find navigating their way through conflicting health, education and developmental opinions challenging.  

Parents discover a health care system full of specialists focused on specific conditions, and an education system designed as if one size fits all.  



Kindom™  breaks down these silos of information, and brings everything together in one unified place.Most importantly, Kindom™  grows with your child.  The more that Kindom™  is used over time, the more valuable it becomes to you and your family and the more insight, support and resources, personalised to your specific needs, become available.


Who would use Kindom™
Whilst we think Kindom™ will be especially valued by parents who have a child with health, learning or developmental challenges, we have learnt from our research that most families will have benefits from the system. 
Here are a few examples of concerns parents and health / educations providers have raised with us, and why we have designed Kindom™.  


New parents find it hard to know how to track growth and remember when health checks or immunisations are due... is their child developing ""normally""... they want access to milestones, reminders, immunisations and collaboration with professionals




Where do you start looking if one of your children suddenly seems to stop in his tracks


Multi-child families want to make sure they pay all their children the attention they deserve



Families who move to a new country (or state) struggle to explain or translate their intrinsic knowledge and it is even more difficult to access existing records if you are in a different country


The following are some specific stories from our community, and we would love to hear yours too.
Asthma / allergies: Self appointed father of the year
Having a child with asthma or allergies can be challenging. Not only do you need to keep track of symptoms, medication and effectiveness of the medication, you also need to communicate effectively with both the service providers and your partner. 




Four children - so much information to keep track of
Every child is unique and different, and when you have more than one or two, the challenge of keeping on top of every different situation and condition can seem insurmountable.


Dental journey: Being able to keep track of everything
Dental issues can have any number of causes. Being able to document and access everything in one place might reveal correlations you might not even have thought of, but that support the dentist to make an informed diagnosis.

Skin Conditions: Finding the right resources and specialists
With four children there are a lot of health and developmental issues. Like most families, it is always a challenge to find the right resources and help.  When you want to do the best by your child, it can be a very emotional journey.




""Dr Google"" - Can  I trust the information and is it relevant?
With so much Information at our fingertips, how do you know what to trust and if it is relevant to you and your children?




Kindom™ Benefits

Kindom™ is like having your own personal parenting assistant.  


Kindom™ helps you identify gaps and strengths, enlist children in their own development, find qualified and relevant information sources, and communicate and share specific information with education and health service providers. Kindom™ enables you to gain an overview and meaningful insights into the developmental and experiential journeys of each family member over time and how they interrelate with each other..  



Whilst every parent could benefit from having their own personal assistant, we think it will be especially valued by parents who have a child with health, learning or developmental challenges.  We know that these parents have to deal with a whole lot more than other parents.  
What Kindom™ can do for YOU!








Secure online storageOne central and secure place where you can store all your child’s health and education records, developmental milestones and other important data, including those many memorable moments.  No more scrambling through filing cabinets to find your child’s immunisation records, the latest school reports, or photos you want to show your mum.






Access to records


We know that accessing data anywhere and at any time is vital for parents. Whether at home, at school, at your child’s doctor, or travelling the world, Kindom™ will enable you to access records instantly, allowing you to consult with educators, and update health professionals, no matter where you are.
 


Tools, Strategies and Resources for Parents
Sometimes the waiting periods for professional support can be months or even a year.  In the meantime, the chance to make a developmental difference is running out and, as a parent, you can feel helpless and frustrated.
Kindom™  can link you with local and online service providers relevant to your child's specific needs, as well as tools and strategies you can apply at home.   You will be able to use that critical waiting time to support your child's health, learning and developmental needs.


Privacy & SecuritySecurity is the one thing that every parent has asked us about so far. Kindom™ adheres to some of the strictest privacy requirements in the world such as HIPAA/PHI and is built on privacy by design - which means we use bank level security as a minimum.  





Collaborating with specialists

We've been working with health and education providers to discover the best ways parents can advocate on behalf of their children.  Using the latest in cognitive technologies, Kindom™ draws on the information parents have collected and automatically translates it into a structure and format best suited to collaboration.  This ensures faster and more personalised assessment, diagnosis and treatment.




Insights, trends over time and correlationsOne of the most powerful aspects of Kindom™ will be its ability to provide you with insights to identify ongoing correlations between different events and observations, visualising trends over time. It will help you to gain better understanding of patterns of health and behaviour in your child and demonstrate this information more clearly to health professionals and educators working with you.  




Informed Decisions

This is where Kindom really shines and brings the latest technology into your hands.
Imagine if you didn't have to sift through masses of information and conflicting opinions, not knowing which is most relevant to your family. Kindom™ automatically searches information you have provided, or that is pulled in from other sources (only accessible to you), matches that with the preferences you set, and uses the latest in cognitive technology (similar to Siri) to draw on an extensive knowledge bank.  Kindom™ is then able to help you analyse information, identify opportunities and issues, and make informed decisions relevant to your specific needs.
To accomplish this, we are developing partnerships with the world’s leading research institutions, health and education providers, along with quality service providers in areas near you.We get very excited about the fact that this information will also enable parents and professionals to identify early indicators that need addressing and to put in place timely intervention strategies where needed.  

Let’s get on to it early!

Cath and Gry met at a young and innovative local service group, Rotary of Crawley (ROC), in 2010.  It soon became apparent that they shared a passion, vision and a drive to make a difference. 



Cath’s interest in developmental differences began when her own children experienced challenges.  Desperately seeking solutions, she read and researched extensively, went from ‘expert to expert”, attended numerous parenting courses and support groups. Her interest in children’s development, didn’t end there.  She later founded a drop in centre for at-risk youth and trained as a psychotherapist.

“I have been stunned to discover that parents are still dealing with same challenges I met back in 1992 - and they don’t need to.”

Gry came across it from a different angle. Her teenage dream was to become a doctor and work in Africa where she lived in her early teens. Her interest in science and technology  lead her to do a degree in the emerging  field of computer science, which she felt would be a more powerful enabler to fight inequality and poverty. Gry has always been involved with children and young people; as a big sister, mentor, foster carer and coach, and has had a hand in a number of initiatives aiming to empower and encourage those in need.
""The tools and technologies that are available today are just waiting for someone to apply them in a meaningful manner and that is what we are doing with Kindom.""

We are passionate about ensuring that people have quality, relevant information at hand in a timely manner and in a form that is meaningful to them, and we are excited to be using technology as an enabler. We are setting up as a social enterprise that is focused on overall positive outcomes and social impact.
Cath has owned and run businesses for over 20 years and has spent the last 8 years consulting to high growth private and family businesses on strategic planning, performance management and governance.

Gry has immersed herself in the world of  integration and interoperability for the past 20 years.  She has led multicultural, cross-disciplinary teams across countries, designing and developing commercial products. Practising agile and lean UX / startup principles, she currently helps companies streamline their organisations for software innovation.  Gry has supplemented her technical skills with an MBA from UWA.  Combining their expertise in getting systems, people and businesses to work together, Gry and Cath gathered years of research and data, and the idea of Kindom was born. 


Kindom™ To Date


The prototype testing - what we learnt


We’ve been researching for over a year now and our Kindom prototype testing clearly showed that most parents want to find the best pathways for their children. No surprises there. 
But, parents told us they often didn't trust the information they were provided, they felt it wasn't relevant, or they didn't have a good way of collaborating with specialists where required.  
Other key findings from usability testing of our prototype were that if it wasn't obvious how to do something, the users didn't do it. Comments we hear from target users are ""it has to be simple"", ""I need to be able to do it on the fly"", ""can you just make it work like my inbox"", ""I would like it to be like Facebook, but secure"".
That’s why we have designed Kindom™ to address these problems.  


By incorporating the world’s latest research, best methods in child development and individual record keeping in the one app, we will make it so much easier for parents and for the professionals working with children.  
We know that better information and greater clarity will always improve outcomes - that’s the value of this app.  It drives what we all want - better outcomes for our children.



About The Perks!
Kindom™ Lite gives you a taster for the basic features including secure, central record keeping to store and retrieve your child’s milestones, health and education records, anywhere access, reminders & immunisations, safe sharing of select data, and 1 GB cloud storage (Est delivery October 2015).



Kindom™ Community extends Kindom™ Lite by allowing you to monitor development and remember significant milestones, understand where your child sits in comparison to their age and stage, reveal trends and patterns over time, and consult and share experiences with the community forum (Est delivery October 2015).




Kindom™ Insights, builds on Kindom™ Community by using all the data you have selected to generate personalised insights. It is a secure collaboration portal, ensuring that health and education providers have up to date and relevant information on which to base their assessments, diagnosis and treatment and provides parents direct access to tools, services and strategies relevant to their child’s needs. (Est delivery March 2016).



Kindom™ Decisions extends Kindom™ Insights and is like having your very own expert personal assistant for parenting!  Using the latest in cognitive technologies, Kindom™ Decisions brings the world of precision health and individualised education support into the hands of parents.  Drawing on a parent’s own insights, combined with world leading health and education resources, Kindom™ supports parents to make the best decisions for their child and their family.  Linking with quality resources and service providers ensures children receive personalised support at the earliest opportunity providing the greatest opportunity to reach their full potential. (Est delivery June 2016).



The ACCELERATED perks include TOBY Playpad,  a unique, therapist-and-parent designed Early Intervention application for children. It has been designed to help any child having difficulty with the early skills needed for learning.  TOBY stands for Therapy Outcomes By You, because it aims to empower parents to commence early intervention to maximize your child’s development. TOBY’s curriculum covers social skills, language, sensory discrimination, and cognitive skills.  It comes with a built-in reward system that reinforces learning, is based on evidence-based interventions and has been more than 5 years in development. (Est delivery August 2015).



How we will use the money


Primary Goal
If we reach our goal of $50,000, we can take our app from prototype to fully functional app with our new designs and start beta trials. The Kindom Lite  / Community app will let you store all your records in one central, secure place that you can access from anywhere and share securely (ETD Oct 2015).
Stretch Goal 2

With $100,000, we will be able to develop Kindom Insights, that gives you more advanced insights into your data and the ability to share the insights with health and education professionals. We connect to more systems to automatically load your data into Kindom  (ETD Mar 2016). 

Stretch Goal 3

We need $200,000 to develop the Kindom Decisions (Premium) with personalised decision support engine using artificial intelligence and commence beta trials (ETD Jun 2016). 

Now we need you to make this happen.  It take a village to raise a child and it takes a community to make sure we develop Kindom to give every child the opportunities they deserve to develop to their potential!!




So please select your perk and help us make Kindom a reality NOW!

<li>
<p><b>
</b></p>
<p>After 30 years of work in textile industry, one old idea
(how to change simple white t-shirt) came to life.</p>
<p>This technology is new because color is dyed on textiles
such as cotton, silk, polyester, nylon, wool an so on, in relation to
existing work with print.</p>
<p>Color reacts to UV-rays, it's harmless for health, and it
does not lose intensity with washing on 30 degrees. Completely diferent and
new, we feel that we came in front of the time. Time that need investment or
investers. Time where we would like to buy machinery to make industrial, faster
and much easier production, because so far we did it all by hands.</p>
<p>Like it was mentoned before, we would like to produce whole new
collection for year in advance, not only our collection, but collections of any
other existing brand and producers that will be happy to have our magic color
changing Technology.</p>

</div></div>","Intro
Over the past several years, we at Aaron High-Tech developed and released a cross-platform programming language called ""8th"".  It allows the programmer to write the program code just once, and using the same code, produce applications which run on Windows, OS X, Linux, Android, iOS and Raspberry Pi.

In the space of just under a year and a half, the 8th user-base has expanded to over seven-hundred, and continues growing at a healthy pace. Our forum is very active and our users have come to expect a high level of customer service from us, which we are proud to provide.

This campaign's goal is to help us raise the funds to expand the 8th family of supported hardware to include ARM embedded processors. Specifically, we are producing a board based on  a powerful STM32F756 Cortex-M7 microcontroller, which will be the first platform supported. 
This board will be a powerful yet low-power device, with special care given to security concerns.  You can find more details on the 8th forum.



With your contribution, we will be able to greatly expand our offering, and make 8th the ""go-to"" solution for comprehensive cross-platform programming needs.
   
What We Need & What You Get We are looking to raise $30,000 which will be entirely used to fund the R&D and testing needed to bring 8th to the board mentioned above.  The development process will take between 3 and 5 months once we've received the funds.

If we don't receive all the funds we are requesting, the development will simply take proportionately longer: we will still use whatever funds we receive to advance this development effort.

What do you get for your contribution?

Depending on the amount of your contribution, you may additionally get a license for embedded 8th (which allows you to produce unrestricted applications).  You will also get an embedded-8th board when it becomes available!

The embedded 8th license includes a separate license for the developer's edition of 8th.


The Impact Your contribution will make it possible for us to create more embedded versions of 8th, much sooner than we would otherwise be able. 

Your contribution will enable embedded programmers to leverage the many advantages of 8th both in their embedded software as well as in the desktop or mobile software they use to control it.

We've been very successful in making 8th work for a wide range of hardware.  Come and help us extend it to the embedded world!

    Risks & Challenges A truly embedded version of 8th will have its own challenges.  We'll have to pare-down the functionality of the current version in order to make it fit.  We'll have to write some very low-level code to work without an operating-system.  

The ultimate goal is to have a version of 8th which is as similar to the full version as possible, but which provides support specific to the embedded platform on which it is running.

Other Ways You Can Help

If you can't contribute money right now, that's OK -- we understand!  You can still help out by sharing information about our campaign and by using the Indiegogo share tools.

<h3>1. Introducing 12FreeWiFi</h3>
<p>We believe that <b>local businesses must ensure their presence on web local searches</b> and for that, they firstly need good reviews, likes and shares. That’s why we have created the 12FreeWiFi box: a tiny router, providing Internet access to your customers through a <b>captive social login page.</b>
</p><p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://login.12freewifi.com/indi/imgs/steps_en.gif"" src="""" style=""""/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
So, the <b>system happens automatically</b> during the login process <b>enabling maximum information</b> about your customers. Furthermore, with a fully customizable landing page, you can choose anything you want to display ( promotions, discounts, informations about future events, your Facebook page... )
<br/><br/>
Then, from your dashboard, <b>boost your social reputation</b> with our tools such as automatic email review sending, emailing campaigns for events, special offers...
<br/><br/>
Furthermore, you can easily <b>manage your customer relationship</b> with the help of an internal review form and the possibility to converse with your customers in order to solve any complaints, and <b>keep your customers happy.</b>

<h3>1. 12FreeWiFi c'est quoi ?</h3>
<p>Nous pensons que les <b>commerces de proximité se doivent désormais d'assurer leur présence sur les résultats des moteurs de recherche au niveau local,</b> et pour cela, ils ont tout d'abord besoin de bonnes critiques sur les sites spécialisés, mais aussi de ""likes"" et de partages. C'est pourquoi nous avons imaginé 12FreeWiFi : un petit routeur qui crée un point Wi-Fi pour vos clients, qui vont devoir se connecter <b>au travers d'un login sur un réseau social.</b>
</p><p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://login.12freewifi.com/indi/imgs/steps_fr.gif"" src="""" style=""""/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
Ainsi, le système <b>capture automatiquement pour vous</b>, durant le processus de connexion, le<b> maximum d'informations à propos de vos clients.</b> De plus, avec une page de destination complètement customisable, vous pouvez proposer à vos clients toute information que vous souhaitez ( des promotions, des réductions, des informations à propos d'un futur évènement, votre page facebook... )
<br/><br/>
Ensuite, grâce à votre tableau de bord, <b>boostez votre réputation online</b> avec nos différents outils marketing tels que l'envoi automatique d'emails X jours après une connexion, la gestion de campagnes d'emailing pour vos évènements, vos offres spéciales... 
<br/><br/>
Vous pouvez également <b>gérer vos retours clients</b> grâce à un formulaire de satisfaction, et la possibilité de converser avec eux afin de résoudre tout problème le plus tôt possible, et ainsi garder <b>une satisfaction clientèle maximale.</b>

We believe that local businesses must ensure their presence on web local searches and for that, they firstly need good reviews, likes and shares. That’s why we have created the 12FreeWiFi box: a tiny router, providing Internet access to your customers through a captive social login page.





So, the system happens automatically during the login process enabling maximum information about your customers. Furthermore, with a fully customizable landing page, you can choose anything you want to display ( promotions, discounts, informations about future events, your Facebook page... )

Then, from your dashboard, boost your social reputation with our tools such as automatic email review sending, emailing campaigns for events, special offers...

Furthermore, you can easily manage your customer relationship with the help of an internal review form and the possibility to converse with your customers in order to solve any complaints, and keep your customers happy.

Companies can be: restaurants and cafes, retail stores, night clubs, hotels, franchises, health, fitness and beauty centers or shopping malls. 
Everybody wants to start reseller activities. We will open our sofware to people who want to sell the device and it's subscription to companies (on our website only, after the Indiegogo campaign end).

 12FreeWiFi
Transformez votre Wi-Fi actuel en machine marketing automatique.
Mise a jour le lundi 30 mai 2016
notre programme est desormais ouvert aux revendeurs !
Vous avez desormais la possibilite d'acheter plusieurs appareils en une seule fois, et de les revendre a vos propres clients ( hotels, cafe, bar... )
Chaque routeur est livre avec un abonnement ( 3 ou 12 mois )
Vous etes libre de vendre les routeurs, mais aussi l'abonnement mensuel au prix de votre choix.

1. 12FreeWiFi c'est quoi ?
Nous pensons que les commerces de proximité se doivent désormais d'assurer leur présence sur les résultats des moteurs de recherche au niveau local, et pour cela, ils ont tout d'abord besoin de bonnes critiques sur les sites spécialisés, mais aussi de ""likes"" et de partages. C'est pourquoi nous avons imaginé 12FreeWiFi : un petit routeur qui crée un point Wi-Fi pour vos clients, qui vont devoir se connecter au travers d'un login sur un réseau social.





Ainsi, le système capture automatiquement pour vous, durant le processus de connexion, le maximum d'informations à propos de vos clients. De plus, avec une page de destination complètement customisable, vous pouvez proposer à vos clients toute information que vous souhaitez ( des promotions, des réductions, des informations à propos d'un futur évènement, votre page facebook... )

Ensuite, grâce à votre tableau de bord, boostez votre réputation online avec nos différents outils marketing tels que l'envoi automatique d'emails X jours après une connexion, la gestion de campagnes d'emailing pour vos évènements, vos offres spéciales... 

Vous pouvez également gérer vos retours clients grâce à un formulaire de satisfaction, et la possibilité de converser avec eux afin de résoudre tout problème le plus tôt possible, et ainsi garder une satisfaction clientèle maximale.




2. Pour qui ?


Toute entreprise qui souhaite proposer le Wi-Fi gratuitement à ses clients et augmenter sa présence en ligne. Les entreprises peuvent être : des restaurants ou cafés, des hôtels, des franchises, des lieux dédiés aux soins ou au bien-être, des boites de nuits, des centres de fitness...

Toute personne voulant démarrer une activité de revendeur. Nous allons en effet ouvrir notre solution de marketing automatique  aux personnes voulant revendre le router et son abonnement à d'autres compagnies ( cela se fera sur notre site Internet uniquement, après la campagne Indiegogo ) .

<h2>We Are A Registered Canadian Charity</h2>
<p>International Student Ministries Canada—ISMC—is a <strong>registered Canadian Charity with the mission to empower international students to impact the world</strong>.  Our CRA registered charity number is 129543302RR0001.  We love international students and we want to assist them to feel at home while studying in Canada. For more than 30 years, we have offered programs such as weekly social gatherings and ESL classes to <strong>help international students to adapt to and enjoy life in our great country</strong>.</p>
<p>ISMC has over 110 staff and 500 volunteers who serve in 34 cities from the Pacific to the Atlantic. There are students from over 50 countries—all five continents—in our programs.</p>
<h2>What We Need</h2>
<p>We need help getting the CADlife app professionally done. It’s not cheap to do it well and make it accessible on all platforms, and keep it updated. Our expertise is helping students. <strong>We are hiring 2 SOLID Technologies to provide their expertise in building the app.</strong> They are giving us a significant discount but we need you to help us pay the bill and get this app out there. This one time funding will get the frame work built out and then it will be self-sustaining. If you own a company or run a business would you consider being a founding sponsor and getting your message in front of all these students? </p>
<p>Anything raised above the minimum target will be used to ensure we have the staff to provide personal response that is a phone call or a text away. We have staff in every province. We are the interface to a strange country. <strong>The app is our front door and calling card</strong>.</p>
<h2>The Project</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470448118/g5laeowjm0frxylrod73.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>There are thousands of  young adults landing in a new country, needing to figure out housing, transit, groceries, furniture, friends, and so much more. Many are on a tight budget. Sure they are all tech savvy but you still have to know the local names, figure out what search tags work locally and how to determine which of the thousands of results are legit. They need to figure out life in Canada. Of course, the university provides some help and encourages them to live in the dorms, but that can be the most expensive and isolated way to live here.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470698688/cllrgdf1czkncznqyza9.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>The CADlife app is like taking a plate of cookies and introducing ourselves to the new international students and helping them find what they need.</strong> We want to be good neighbors and welcome them in our midst. There are over <strong>400,000 International students in Canada</strong>. We want our international student guests to feel at home in Canada, learn practical information, better plan their journey, navigate our communities, find friendly faces, get local advice, and connect with a real person available to answer questions. We want it all in one place, in <strong>the CADlife app, where students can find the latest information at their fingertips in one place</strong>, filtered by our staff and international students that are already here.<strong> The CADlife app will allow students to:</strong></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">EXPLORE</h3>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">PLAN</h3>
<p>PLAN: The CADlife app provides students with the tools to schedule events, set reminders, add to-dos and personal notes in order to stay organized in their journey abroad. As well they have access to lists and things to think about from previous students. <br/> </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">CONNECT</h3>
<p>CONNECT: CADlife will help students build relationships with local and international friends. Thanks to the chat feature, students can connect with individuals or groups of people to share experiences. With the connect feature they can send a message and get connected to a real life person that can provide advice, information and connection to a local volunteer or staff member for help. </p>

<h2><strong>What You Get</strong></h2>
<p>Everyone who participates by making a contribution or spreading the word is <strong>helping us to launch a life-changing app</strong>. If everyone does a little, we will achieve something great. Arriving in a new country, new school, with often a new language can be very intimidating. You get to help make it easier by building the CADlife app that <strong>bridges international students to information, services, and people dedicated helping them feel at home in Canada</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Check out our perks on the sidebar.</strong> Do your part to help our International students become part of our community and feel the Canadian welcome. Give yourself a pat on the back and share it with friends. That warm feeling inside is worth every penny you give. You will notice that we have chosen internet deliverable perks (with a hard copy available for those who want it). As a charity we want to ensure that every dollar goes towards the app. Your participation is greatly appreciated and we hope you will download and share the app when it is ready. </p>

<p>Because we are a registered Charity, <strong>tax deductible receipts are available for Canadian donors for gifts over $20</strong>. However, Indiegogo cannot supply charitable receipts. <strong>Gifts requiring charitable receipts must be processed through <a href=""https://www.ismc.ca/project.aspx?asset=413"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ISMC</a></strong>, but will count towards the Indiegogo campaign goals.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p><strong>We want to empower international students to feel at home in Canada</strong>: To be welcomed by community groups and be connected to social and cultural networks. Did you know that less than 1 in 4 International Students is ever invited inside a Canadian home? ISMC wants to change that.<strong> Let’s get international students connected and cared for</strong>. <strong>They will find friends, communities, and caring Canadians via the app</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Inspire someone </strong>by providing a platform where community groups can connect with International students.</li>
<li>
<strong>Provide connection</strong> by having a phone and text line available connecting to a real person that can answer questions, give advice and put a student in contact with a local person to help them.</li>
<li>
<strong>Find trusted advice</strong>. Previous International students can give tips and experiences that will help the new students, but there is no where for them to connect without this app. The app will allow us to share those tips and post trusted info of what has worked.</li>
<li>
<strong>Crowd Sourcing Info</strong>. In every city and university there are local groups, FaceBook groups, give away groups, sources of insider information that an outsider has trouble finding. The app will connect them to local groups and sources, providing a place where crowd sourcing helps the students find what they need.</li>
<li>
<strong>Share the Spirit of being Canadian</strong>. We are known as polite, loving, open people, but for a new student feeling lost it can be hard to know who to trust, who to go to, who to ask about cough syrup. Nothing looks familiar. The app will help students connect, make choices, and get the help they deserve.<br/> </li>
</ol>
</div><div>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>#1  There are 400,000 International Students in Canada this year. There are more coming next year. The challenge is to get the word out to them so that they know this resource is available. <strong>We appreciate every share and every conversation you have to promote the app among international students and those who have contact with them.</strong></p>
<p>#2  <strong>We need community groups, pages, social groups and more to submit their info so we can make the connections and provide the links.</strong> Our staff at universities across the country will be gathering tried and true contacts, places, links, and activities to include. It’s a gigantic task and will be an ongoing effort to keep adding and updating info until we cover every city where international students are living in Canada.

</div></div>","We Are A Registered Canadian Charity
International Student Ministries Canada—ISMC—is a registered Canadian Charity with the mission to empower international students to impact the world.  Our CRA registered charity number is 129543302RR0001.  We love international students and we want to assist them to feel at home while studying in Canada. For more than 30 years, we have offered programs such as weekly social gatherings and ESL classes to help international students to adapt to and enjoy life in our great country.
ISMC has over 110 staff and 500 volunteers who serve in 34 cities from the Pacific to the Atlantic. There are students from over 50 countries—all five continents—in our programs.
What We Need
We need help getting the CADlife app professionally done. It’s not cheap to do it well and make it accessible on all platforms, and keep it updated. Our expertise is helping students. We are hiring 2 SOLID Technologies to provide their expertise in building the app. They are giving us a significant discount but we need you to help us pay the bill and get this app out there. This one time funding will get the frame work built out and then it will be self-sustaining. If you own a company or run a business would you consider being a founding sponsor and getting your message in front of all these students? 
Anything raised above the minimum target will be used to ensure we have the staff to provide personal response that is a phone call or a text away. We have staff in every province. We are the interface to a strange country. The app is our front door and calling card.
The Project


There are thousands of  young adults landing in a new country, needing to figure out housing, transit, groceries, furniture, friends, and so much more. Many are on a tight budget. Sure they are all tech savvy but you still have to know the local names, figure out what search tags work locally and how to determine which of the thousands of results are legit. They need to figure out life in Canada. Of course, the university provides some help and encourages them to live in the dorms, but that can be the most expensive and isolated way to live here.

The CADlife app is like taking a plate of cookies and introducing ourselves to the new international students and helping them find what they need. We want to be good neighbors and welcome them in our midst. There are over 400,000 International students in Canada. We want our international student guests to feel at home in Canada, learn practical information, better plan their journey, navigate our communities, find friendly faces, get local advice, and connect with a real person available to answer questions. We want it all in one place, in the CADlife app, where students can find the latest information at their fingertips in one place, filtered by our staff and international students that are already here. The CADlife app will allow students to:

EXPLORE
EXPLORE: The CADlife app has everything covered with information for before departure and after arrival; tips and advice to settle and integrate; as well as the available options for after graduation and staying in Canada for work. 

PLAN
PLAN: The CADlife app provides students with the tools to schedule events, set reminders, add to-dos and personal notes in order to stay organized in their journey abroad. As well they have access to lists and things to think about from previous students.  

CONNECT
CONNECT: CADlife will help students build relationships with local and international friends. Thanks to the chat feature, students can connect with individuals or groups of people to share experiences. With the connect feature they can send a message and get connected to a real life person that can provide advice, information and connection to a local volunteer or staff member for help. 

 
What You Get
Everyone who participates by making a contribution or spreading the word is helping us to launch a life-changing app. If everyone does a little, we will achieve something great. Arriving in a new country, new school, with often a new language can be very intimidating. You get to help make it easier by building the CADlife app that bridges international students to information, services, and people dedicated helping them feel at home in Canada.
Check out our perks on the sidebar. Do your part to help our International students become part of our community and feel the Canadian welcome. Give yourself a pat on the back and share it with friends. That warm feeling inside is worth every penny you give. You will notice that we have chosen internet deliverable perks (with a hard copy available for those who want it). As a charity we want to ensure that every dollar goes towards the app. Your participation is greatly appreciated and we hope you will download and share the app when it is ready. 

Because we are a registered Charity, tax deductible receipts are available for Canadian donors for gifts over $20. However, Indiegogo cannot supply charitable receipts. Gifts requiring charitable receipts must be processed through ISMC, but will count towards the Indiegogo campaign goals. 

The Impact
We want to empower international students to feel at home in Canada: To be welcomed by community groups and be connected to social and cultural networks. Did you know that less than 1 in 4 International Students is ever invited inside a Canadian home? ISMC wants to change that. Let’s get international students connected and cared for. They will find friends, communities, and caring Canadians via the app.


Inspire someone by providing a platform where community groups can connect with International students.

Provide connection by having a phone and text line available connecting to a real person that can answer questions, give advice and put a student in contact with a local person to help them.

Find trusted advice. Previous International students can give tips and experiences that will help the new students, but there is no where for them to connect without this app. The app will allow us to share those tips and post trusted info of what has worked.

Crowd Sourcing Info. In every city and university there are local groups, FaceBook groups, give away groups, sources of insider information that an outsider has trouble finding. The app will connect them to local groups and sources, providing a place where crowd sourcing helps the students find what they need.

Share the Spirit of being Canadian. We are known as polite, loving, open people, but for a new student feeling lost it can be hard to know who to trust, who to go to, who to ask about cough syrup. Nothing looks familiar. The app will help students connect, make choices, and get the help they deserve. 


Risks & Challenges
#1  There are 400,000 International Students in Canada this year. There are more coming next year. The challenge is to get the word out to them so that they know this resource is available. We appreciate every share and every conversation you have to promote the app among international students and those who have contact with them.
#2  We need community groups, pages, social groups and more to submit their info so we can make the connections and provide the links. Our staff at universities across the country will be gathering tried and true contacts, places, links, and activities to include. It’s a gigantic task and will be an ongoing effort to keep adding and updating info until we cover every city where international students are living in Canada. We are starting with the 34 cities where we have staff.
#3  Ongoing funding to keep the app updated and technologically current as platforms and links change rapidly. We will have ongoing funding every year to keep the app current through ads, sponsorships, donations, and local community events.

This opportunity is similar to being able to register a domain name before most people even knew the word ""Internet."" One of the first GN adopters, Joel Gordon, Esq, who registered GN during our test-marketing, has recently refused an offer of $15,000 for his GN - ""attorney"" or ""77"".

On top of this, you contribute to GN's cause - respect to the consumer's right to privacy in advertising. 

What is General Number?
GN is a rare case when technology disrupts not one but several markets. It improves a customer's experience so drastically, that not offering GN will place a company at a major competitive disadvantage. 
Therefore the pressure to adopt GN is coming from both individuals and businesses. 
Yet, GN is not just a clever piece of software, it is also a social cause of re-introducing privacy into relationships between people and brands. 
GN offers a way for businesses to interact with consumers, which is more efficient not in-spite, but because it respects people's privacy. It works through two distinctive entities: Public GN and Private GN.

Public GNPublic GN is a permanent number and a word (vanity GN) chosen by an organization or a professional. Examples of a Public GN are ""Dentist"" and ""2933"".


Private GNGN requires no registration for consumers and their GN is a random, disposable number, which is generated for a single exchange of information with another individual or organization. Consumer information always travels end-to-end and is NOT stored in the cloud.                                                 
Unlike QR codes, Public GNs can be captured from any medium 






and appears like a phone contact, which takes no additional space on the home screen of a smartphone:


Each Public GN is an interactive contact card aggregating all social media with the functionality of a custom mobile application, which includes a number of proprietary functions available only through GN!






                                   General Number completely transforms the customer support experience


     



No more frustration or delays with road-side assistance











                 Free on-demand advertising that respects privacy


GN is not just a new technology, it is also a cause. It creates an environment where brands do not need to infringe on individuals' privacy to deliver an advertisement.              





                           

Make a donation pledge in under 12 seconds 
Listeners are more likely to donate and will donate the most while they are emotionally connected to a non-profit's story that they heard over the radio. 
By the time they come home, they will not remember the URL, but they are not likely to get on the phone with a campaign volunteer while they are driving.  

GN enables a donation pledge faster, easier and more accurately than any other platform!


Lisa Benjamini, President of the PCOS Foundation and well known Houston philanthropist, shares her GN experience: ""Rather than waiting for at least a month and investing almost $3,000 in the development of our own mobile app, it took my administrative assistant only five minutes to create a GN. It does everything we would want to have in our mobile app and has some functionality that is only available through GN. For example, our patrons can now make a donation pledge in under 10 seconds.""




""There are a lot more uses for GN, and we are certain you will find a new one yourself."" - Bill Fogarty 

The team
Our team has a history of developing very effective consumer products that were far ahead of their time. Back in 2000, we developed the first in the world cloud based personal firewall, pcInternet Patrol (PCIP), before the word ""cloud"" even entered the mainstream language. In 2007, we were acquired by pcTools, just before it became a part of the Symantec corporation, which now owns our patent. PCIP technology is incorporated into many security products and is referenced in more than one hundred subsequent patents of Microsoft, Symantec, Kaspersky, IBM, Dell, Fujitsu, AT&T and a lot more small and large companies around the world   Traction

Up until now, GN could only be reserved by private invitation. We want to spread the
word about GN before opening public registration, in order to give everyone an equal chance in getting the best GN, whether you live in New York, California, or anywhere else. 
Our pre-marketing
experience has shown very strong interest coming from across all industries: Early GN adopters include the PCOS Foundation (GN
“PCOS” or “2933”), Don McGill Toyota (GN ""Autos"" or
""2000""), Jonathan Kaplow (GN ""CPA"" or
""1040""), the University
of Houston Investment Banking Scholars Club (GN: ""4272"" or
""ISBC""), Grace Point Community Church (and many
other organizations and businesses). 
We also are working with major payment brands, which are interested in GN's ability to close the last security vulnerability during card-not-present transactions. 
In sum, without a doubt GN has the potential to become a household name, and with your help, we are determined to
make it happen.

Other ways you can help

Many of our early adopters have reported that when they share their Public GN with others, the most common question they are asked is, ""How can I get a GN for my business too?"" You can help by spreading the word about GN through social media as well as through word of mouth.
In addition to that, while GN is reaching critical mass, there may be other opportunities about which you can inquire by emailing to support@generalnumber.com.

What else do you get?
 You may also get a GN t-shirt with your number:",14.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Your tool for creating achievable goals.</strong></p>
<p> The Daily Goal Setter by Mål Paper is a productivity and gratitude planner, specifically designed to help you to achieve your goals.</p>
<p>The Daily Goal Setter planner is Mål Paper’s first product to be launched. Simple and effective, the Daily Goal Setter enables you to create a clutter-free canvas for optimising your potential. </p>
<p>The Daily Goal Setter is more than just a planner. It explains how to effectively set goals so you can identify and prioritise your long-term, medium-term and short-term goals, while creating actionable tasks to help you achieve tasks. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554800438/u5ektmredkfhyyrxwgyt.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Mål Paper was created due to a lack of stationery available specifically designed as a tool to help de-clutter your mind. </p>
<p>The word ‘Mål’ means ‘goal’ in Swedish. Our stationery range also takes inspiration from the Scandinavian clean and clutter-free way of living.  As a result, Mål Paper was born - the stylish and simplistic stationery brand that helps us to be more productive by focusing our minds on the most important tasks.</p>
<p>The Daily Goal Setter planner is the result of seeking a product to solve the common problem of jumping from one task to the next, without prioritising them or even completing the previous task. We were tired of having countless ‘to-do’ lists on notepads, notebooks and journals that did nothing more than complicate our goals and tasks further, to the point of feeling overwhelmed and uninspired to hold ourselves accountable.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554800578/vwxia8xrswvkijqcvfum.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>That’s exactly why we designed a planner that will help you to confirm and structure your goals, keeping you organised and focused.</p>
<p>Our mission with the Daily Goal Setter planner is simple. Focus on creating a product that gives the user clarity on what they want to achieve, while helping them plan out the tasks that will help them to get there with the use of positive mind shift setting, measurement and effectiveness. We also wanted the planner to help create a positive mindset with the use of daily gratitude practices and affirmations. </p>
<p>To help us create this planner we looked towards the methods used by outstanding performers and how they set themselves for a productive day, week or month. In the Daily Goal Setter planner, you will see elements from some of the principles and methods they use, most notably the methods from Brian Tracy’s Eat That Frog. A simple method used to help rid you of procrastination and help you in achieving more goals in less time.</p>

<p>While there are a number of productivity and gratitude based planners and journals on the market, we believe that we have de-cluttered some of the fussier designs and added more practicality. </p>
<p> We want you to have the most productive, gratifying and fulfilling life possible. With the Daily Goal Setter planner, you’ve taken the first step.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554800626/vrv0lvtplo5uk8cbqrcr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Be clear on what it is you want to achieve in your short, medium and long-term goals. Stay focussed by referring back to your goals and the tasks that will help achieve these.</p>

<p>Plan your day, week and months tasks by prioritising them in order of importance. Prioritising and planning your tasks will mean you have a proactive day, rather than a reactive day. Focus on the tasks you’ve prioritised, rather than the less important, quick win tasks.</p>

<p>Start and end your day on a high, by reflecting on everything that you are grateful for. Using the daily practice of gratitude and affirmations will help create a positive mindset that will be carried on to all aspects of your life.</p>

</div></div>","Your tool for creating achievable goals.
 The Daily Goal Setter by Mål Paper is a productivity and gratitude planner, specifically designed to help you to achieve your goals.
The Daily Goal Setter planner is Mål Paper’s first product to be launched. Simple and effective, the Daily Goal Setter enables you to create a clutter-free canvas for optimising your potential. 
The Daily Goal Setter is more than just a planner. It explains how to effectively set goals so you can identify and prioritise your long-term, medium-term and short-term goals, while creating actionable tasks to help you achieve tasks. 


Mål Paper was created due to a lack of stationery available specifically designed as a tool to help de-clutter your mind. 
The word ‘Mål’ means ‘goal’ in Swedish. Our stationery range also takes inspiration from the Scandinavian clean and clutter-free way of living.  As a result, Mål Paper was born - the stylish and simplistic stationery brand that helps us to be more productive by focusing our minds on the most important tasks.
The Daily Goal Setter planner is the result of seeking a product to solve the common problem of jumping from one task to the next, without prioritising them or even completing the previous task. We were tired of having countless ‘to-do’ lists on notepads, notebooks and journals that did nothing more than complicate our goals and tasks further, to the point of feeling overwhelmed and uninspired to hold ourselves accountable.

That’s exactly why we designed a planner that will help you to confirm and structure your goals, keeping you organised and focused.
Our mission with the Daily Goal Setter planner is simple. Focus on creating a product that gives the user clarity on what they want to achieve, while helping them plan out the tasks that will help them to get there with the use of positive mind shift setting, measurement and effectiveness. We also wanted the planner to help create a positive mindset with the use of daily gratitude practices and affirmations. 
To help us create this planner we looked towards the methods used by outstanding performers and how they set themselves for a productive day, week or month. In the Daily Goal Setter planner, you will see elements from some of the principles and methods they use, most notably the methods from Brian Tracy’s Eat That Frog. A simple method used to help rid you of procrastination and help you in achieving more goals in less time.

While there are a number of productivity and gratitude based planners and journals on the market, we believe that we have de-cluttered some of the fussier designs and added more practicality. 
 We want you to have the most productive, gratifying and fulfilling life possible. With the Daily Goal Setter planner, you’ve taken the first step.


Be clear on what it is you want to achieve in your short, medium and long-term goals. Stay focussed by referring back to your goals and the tasks that will help achieve these.

Plan your day, week and months tasks by prioritising them in order of importance. Prioritising and planning your tasks will mean you have a proactive day, rather than a reactive day. Focus on the tasks you’ve prioritised, rather than the less important, quick win tasks.

Start and end your day on a high, by reflecting on everything that you are grateful for. Using the daily practice of gratitude and affirmations will help create a positive mindset that will be carried on to all aspects of your life.

Celebrate your wins, and work out what you can do to improve on tasks that didn’t go to plan. At the end of each day, week and month you’ll reflect on how effective and productive you were, and how much closer you are to achieving your goals.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u>THE STORY BEHIND PENTIUM</u></h2>
<p>As a college student, I learned that I desperately needed to have better time management and planning skills. So I began looking for a portable daily planner that would help me focus on one day at a time and also give me an overview of the month when necessary. However, almost everything that I found was either too bulky or poorly formatted.</p>
<p>Instead of just settling for an imperfect alternative, I decided to create my own solution! I purchased a blank, pocket-sized notebook and developed my own layout for each page, with two specific pages for each month and day. A few weeks later, I began to consider combining the two things that I carried in my back pockets every day: my wallet and my pocket planner. After all, my wallet was overloaded with stuff I hardly ever needed, so I merged my wallet with my new planner.</p>
<p>Because my planner was now so accessible, I found myself using it more frequently and accomplishing more important things with my time. Not only was I achieving better productivity with my time, but I was also able to free up more time to do the things I cared most about! And to top it off, the simplified wallet design helped me eliminate my bulky wallet and minimize what I carried in my pockets every day.</p>
<p>After receiving a noticeable number of compliments and questions about my planner wallet, I began to wonder if I could share my product and the <i>value</i> it adds with others. So after plenty of design iterations, product trials, and open doors, we’re here to bring you the first Pentium Planner Wallet!</p>

<p>Even after our successful Kickstarter campaign, we were still<strong> </strong>$1,600 short of what we needed to buy our first inventory order.

<p>All of the money that we raise through this campaign will be directed towards our first inventory order, and at this point every dollar counts! While there are other means for raising money, we truly believe that crowdfunding is the best way to share our product with the world and raise the money we need to bring it to life! So here are<strong> 3 BIG THINGS </strong>you can do to help us make it happen:</p>

<li>
<strong>CONTRIBUTE TO THE CAMPAIGN!</strong> Everyone could use some help managing their time and boosting their productivity, so take advantage of this special opportunity!</li>
<li>
<strong>SHARE THE CAMPAIGN</strong> personally with friends and on social media, and don't forget about the share tools here on Indiegogo!</li>

<strong>GIVE US YOUR FEEDBACK! </strong>We want to know what you think about the product, the campaign, and anything else related to what we're trying to accomplish</li>

<p>The general challenge that we (and so many other small businesses face) is developing a solid cycle of sourcing materials, manufacturing the product, storing the inventory, and fulfilling orders. Thankfully, we have found a great manufacturer and shipping partner who will help us produce and fulfill our orders at an affordable cost. The biggest hurdle we face now is raising the money for the first inventory order!</p>
<p>In terms of order fulfillment, we have given ourselves and our manufacturer a conservative window of time to deliver our products to our invaluable backers, though we hope to deliver our rewards much sooner than July of 2017 (this is the date that the rewards are set to be delivered to backers).</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">I spent over 15 years in corporate leadership development and as an International Speaker on women in Leadership. My research was published in the Financial Times, Daily Telegraph, Time Magazine and endorsed by the Secretary of State. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">I created my own system for reaching my goals because I had to manage my career and simultaneously bring up my 3 children as a single parent. I tried the Franklin Covey planner and Filofax and even Tony Robbins RPM but nothing worked for me as a single working Mum. I needed something simple that would help me manage my complex life. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">So I created my own productivity system that took care of my whole life from my health and spiritual goals to my businesses and career and simultaneously put my children center stage. I then taught that system to my Blue Chip clients.</p>

My dozens of pages of lists are disappearing – not all gone yet. I particularly love being able to drag and re-prioritize items – makes my old numbering and highlighting seem very pedestrian."" Linda Cairns  ""I use Dump Chunk Do every day without fail. Not that this is an achievement but it is a necessity for me. As a graduate in my first role, it can be really overwhelming to learn to manage what's expected of me on a day to day basis. Dump Chunk Do reduces that overwhelm because I am able to Dump all of the to-do's and demands that are constantly arising. I can then organize my time and prioritize  easily with the simple color coding and drag and drop system. I love how it also takes care of my personal goals too.""  Grace Phelan  Premium Features for Coaches and BusinessesIf you are an Executive Coach who cares about client results or a business that cares about employee well being, you can see below a  dashboard.

Join us to help 1M people reduce overwhelm
I spent over 15 years in corporate leadership development and as an International Speaker on women in Leadership. My research was published in the Financial Times, Daily Telegraph, Time Magazine and endorsed by the Secretary of State. 
I created my own system for reaching my goals because I had to manage my career and simultaneously bring up my 3 children as a single parent. I tried the Franklin Covey planner and Filofax and even Tony Robbins RPM but nothing worked for me as a single working Mum. I needed something simple that would help me manage my complex life. 
So I created my own productivity system that took care of my whole life from my health and spiritual goals to my businesses and career and simultaneously put my children center stage. I then taught that system to my Blue Chip clients.
I turned my proprietary system into a paper planner in 2010
(Old Facebook pic of my paper planner 2010 ) 

 
Then, whilst delivering a seminar at Google HQ 2012,  my  clients asked me to turn my paper system into software. 
This is me on stage in Belgium . I love my work because I love helping people and my mission is to reach as many people as possible in my lifetime. 

I also love to learn and grow so I said YES to the challenge from the  Google seminar and started putting my IP into  a digital format.  With no knowledge of Technology or the digital world it was to become the steepest learning curve of my entire career! 
We now have over 1000 happy users who have helped  us build this dream product by telling us what they needed from a digital planner. 

Risks & Challenges
The biggest risk to the business has been my lack of Tech knowledge. . I am a single Mom of 3 girls and I have a background in psychology not Technology or software. My passion is what drives me and I am committed to building the very best Tech Team who share my values to get this amazing product out to as many people as we can find in our lifetime.

<h2><span style=""background-color: initial;"">What is GoWriter?</span></h2>
<p></p> <p>GoWriter has already been described as the world's most advanced writer's software. After years of working with Windows 98 word processors, we thought it was time authors took a giant leap for all writers! </p>
<p>Us writer's have been described as having multiple personality disorder, as we have to be in the heads of each and every one of our characters; each with different traits and characteristics. However, we've yearned for years for a software program that can keep up with us!</p>
<p>We are striving to integrate every major player in our writing world, including <b>WattPad</b>, <b>NaNoWriMo</b> challenges, #<b>JustWriteIt</b> challenges and much more!</p>
<p>No more. That's why I founded GoWriter. It keeps track of every personality, chapter, group, location and any other novel asset you can think to add to a book. It also cleverly organizes research to promote historical/trade accuracy and does it all while looking good.</p>

</div></div>","What is GoWriter?
 GoWriter has already been described as the world's most advanced writer's software. After years of working with Windows 98 word processors, we thought it was time authors took a giant leap for all writers! 
Us writer's have been described as having multiple personality disorder, as we have to be in the heads of each and every one of our characters; each with different traits and characteristics. However, we've yearned for years for a software program that can keep up with us!
We are striving to integrate every major player in our writing world, including WattPad, NaNoWriMo challenges, #JustWriteIt challenges and much more!
No more. That's why I founded GoWriter. It keeps track of every personality, chapter, group, location and any other novel asset you can think to add to a book. It also cleverly organizes research to promote historical/trade accuracy and does it all while looking good.




















 We have two versions planned for this milestone. Each version and its features are listed below (don't want to bore you with a bunch of text).








What We Need

 

Expenses








Development (myself included) - Three total developers to focus on functionality, forward progress, bugs and issues : $9,500


Design - Two designers for application development and site layout : $3,600


Content Marketing - A single content marketer for optimal language throughout GoWriter : $1,500


QA Testing - A single dedicated QA Engineer to provide a fresh pair of eyes to locate issues and bugs for the best experience : $1,200


Encryption & Security - This includes EV Plus level SSL and AES 256-bit encryption of your data to ensure the highest level of security: $1,200


Development Server - A dedicated server for development and hosting of the live environment to make GoWriter available. This includes a basic dedicated environment (no stretch goals included) : $4,200


TinyMCE Enterprise - We've already negotiated with the official makers of TinyMCE to provide you with a MORE functional WYSIWYG editor with inline spellcheck and SUPER paste (one of the best Microsoft Word paste applications ever made) : $2,200


IGG Fee - We didn't want to inflate our goal and play it off as something else. We've included the IndieGoGo fee into our goals and want you to know about it : $2,150

This brings the total to $25,550 - a small price to pay for a huge leap for authors everywhere!


If we can't reach our goal:
We have a fail-safe in place, unfortunately it means it will take longer to develop. We will finish everything, even if it takes us a year, but if we can't meet our goal, we will cut the budget of the following categories in order:* TinyMCE Enterprise* Content Marketing* Development Server* QA Testing

   Stretch Goals We have three AWESOME stretch goals already planned:  GoWriter Premium Version GoWriter Pass BPE Engine and Sygno Thesaurus


What is GoWriter Premium? 
We are planning an even bigger and better version of GoWriter, one that includes never-before-used technologies like visual maps! 





This adds tremendous functionality to the GoWriter platform. This stretch goal comes to a total of $6,750 in addition to our base goal.

$32,300 total funding to make GoWriter Premium happen!



What is GoWriter Pass? 

Multi-Writer Collaboration
We love online-functionalities as much as the next person. If you're a gamer, as soon as you hear ""online"" you know exactly what that means: multiplayer. Just like the gaming multiplayer idea, we want to give you the ability to collaborate on projects. You would be able to add as many writers as you'd like to create a novel by multiple authors!

Cloud Storage
In addition to online collaboration, we want to add the ability to store your projects in the cloud. You shouldn't be confined to just one computer, we want you to be able to open and work on your projects from anywhere!


This is probably the most exciting stretch goal yet, except that we need to have GoWriter Premium done first. The total for this stretch goal is 14,800 in addition to our base goal + the GoWriter Premium stretch goal.
$47,100 total funding to make GoWriter Pass happen!





What is the BPE and Sygno Thesaurus? 
We're in the process of patenting two distinct idea concepts: a Behavioral Prediction Engine and a Writer's Thesaurus.
The Behavioral Prediction Engine
Ever hit a roadblock because you've been busy with your multiple-personality disorder from writing all of your characters? Fear not! We want to add an incredibly in-depth character creation process - so in-depth that we would be actually able to predict what your characters would do for you!
Not sure what your main character would do if he were tied up and thrown into a pool? Based on how you document his traits, he may panic and drown or he may realize that he kept that piece of glass in his sock for a reason.
This has to be our favorite stretch goal ever, we will make it happen one way or another - whether it's in two years or in six months is up to you!
Sygno ThesaurusOne of the biggest complaints of writer's is that they will repeat descriptive text. 
""His hair was peppered with gray linings.""
We want to give you other writers' perspectives on another way to describe this gentlemen's hair! With online collaboration we may find that ""a few rogue streaks of gray had begun to show his age.""
Don't limit your writing to repetative nature. Beat it with our Sygno Thesaurus!

As you can imagine, these two are probably the largest projects of the stretch goals, but we're determined! The total amount of this stretch goal would be $18,250 in addition to our base goal + the first two stretch goals.

<span>iBuySell was co-founded by Kaus Mukherjee and his wife, Suchi, who migrated to the United States in the late 1990s.

This brand new fast-paced concept provokes nail biting adrenaline rushes as consumers make split-second decisions: either risk losing the product altogether by holding out for a lower price or buy it as quickly as possible before anyone else has a chance.


App Availability

Our full app is still in development. In the meantime, you can download the iBuySell BETA!The full version of the app will be live after the campaign is over.

iOS: iOS limits BETA downloads to 2,000 users. To request access, click the button and leave your details. If there is a spot available, we will be in touch the instructions.
Android: Download BETA by clicking the below button- downloads are unlimited! 
*These BETA options offer limited functionality- you’re getting exclusive access to the platform before anyone else! Please provide your feedback here.









            
 









For Buyers - Keep discovering new products as the revolving showroom refreshes minute by minute with tons of new deals. Sales last for no more than 90 seconds and will give you a rush of excitement as you compete to win your favorite products at the best possible price. You’ll be faced split second decisions to either buy that coveted dress or purse at its current price or risk losing it to another shopper in hopes of getting a better deal as the prices fall lower by the second.

Sellers - Set secret sale minimums and move inventory quickly. With sales that last at the most 90 seconds and a limit of 15 minutes for payments, you'll know what you sold and at exactly what price in less than 30 minutes. That's a huge improvement over other platforms where auctions run for around seven days.





Unlike existing platforms, you won’t get stuck browsing the same products on a loop. With iBuySell, you’ll see the latest sale items under various categories every time in real-time. You discover new items rather than just search for products you already know.

 


The seller is responsible for shipping on iBuySell, but we provide the shipping labels that can be printed right from the app
Before the payment is released to sellers, sellers have to ship the products.Once the product has been shipped and updated with a tracking number, payment is released to the sellers. Buyers have 14 days to return an item if not satisfied. Buyers also rate the sellers once the item has been received.
Sellers can post their listings and share socially to attract more buyers. Every buyer gets iBuySell credit for sharing the purchase with his/her friends in social media. That is, for every social network share, you get credit towards your next purchase when your friends join through your shared link




iBuySell is for anyone -- individual sellers and buyers, small retailers, mom & pop shops, etc. Anyone who likes to online shop with no risk, small fees, and flexible options will love iBuySell. We will always be easy and cheap, but for a limited time,we are also completely free. The time to sign up is now!

<h3>Story from the Founder</h3>
<p>Hello Crowdfunders!</p>
<p>Just to introduce myself briefly, my name is Mikahil, founder of the Here &amp; there platform.</p>
<p>Throughout my life I've had the pleasure of living in multiple countries and getting to know diverse people and cultures, namely, Mozambique,China, the UAE, Portugal, Cyprus.</p>
<p>The story I would like to share is of when my family moved back from China to Mozambique 13 years ago.</p>
<p>It was 8th grade design and technology class and while we waited for the bell to ring our teacher decided to start the following debate:</p>
<p><strong>Is money important?</strong></p>
<p>As you would expect, 99% of the class went on to argue why money was/is important and how it basically meant independence, power, etc etc.</p>

What We Need & What You Get

We come to the crowdfunding community because we know how passionate you are with innovation and change.
We set a minimal funding target simply because we already have the platform ready, however, we would like to be able to proceed with new functionalities as well as being able to offer guided support to our fellow entrepreneurs!

We hope that crowdfunding helps us reach out to the most service providers and we would like to dedicate a marketing budget to advertise their services!
We also have innovative features that are being developed but we can't share them just yet!
As for Licensing and infrastructure, we all have to take care of our legal due diligence but we would also like to grow the team.
Our perks are for those interested in becoming a part of the community, we really can't wait to get to know what you have to offer the world!
If we don't reach our entire funding goal we will continue to develop the platform, simply with less features and languages. (We still move forward, just not as fast as we can!)


Other Ways You Can Help?
Some of us just can't contribute financially but that doesn't mean there is no other way to help!

Please help spread the word!

Story from the Founder
Hello Crowdfunders!
Just to introduce myself briefly, my name is Mikahil, founder of the Here & there platform.
Throughout my life I've had the pleasure of living in multiple countries and getting to know diverse people and cultures, namely, Mozambique,China, the UAE, Portugal, Cyprus.
The story I would like to share is of when my family moved back from China to Mozambique 13 years ago.
It was 8th grade design and technology class and while we waited for the bell to ring our teacher decided to start the following debate:
Is money important?
As you would expect, 99% of the class went on to argue why money was/is important and how it basically meant independence, power, etc etc.
Once the class had settled, our teacher - Mr. Tom - asked if anyone had a different opinion, if someone thought money was not all that important.
Unfortunately for me at the time, I would be the only one to argue that case.
As the shy ""new kid"" it was difficult to debate this, seeing as even my new friends did not share this opinion.
However, I went on to argue how money is simply a means to an end, how previously we would simply ""trade items"" (as an adult I know this is called Bartering). I made other points to support my opinion but it was emotional, contradicting a class full of 12-year-olds!
Towards the end, our teacher finally told us to settle down and asked if I could make a final closing statement.
My final statement would be:
""If I could give you a billion dollars and put you alone on an island, the value of that piece of paper would be nothing. Instead, you would value the experience of being able to hunt or fish.""
Mr. Tom always expected a fully disciplined class, waiting until we were all quiet to let us leave (even if the bell rang!). He would always end with ""Ladies, you may be excused"", followed by ""gents"" 2 minutes later.
On that day, after my final statement he said ""Mika, you may be excused"", the only one to leave the class early.
It was weird at first, I even thought I did something wrong!
In hindsight, it was very liberating and empowering.

 
The lesson I learned:
As an adult, I still believe what holds the most value is what WE have to offer the world. Being able to share our knowledge and experience is what gives us value in the “marketplace”. This is true with a 9-5 job as much as with freelance jobs.
It is with this same opinion that I would like to present a platform where activity  and service providers share what they have to offer the world, even if it is only their part-time passion!
In university and as a part-time freelance football coach it was difficult for me to find new clients if not through word-of-mouth.
I had no newspaper ad, no website or social media group to promote what I had to offer the world.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>dodl.es makes it simple to animate on mobile devices through collaboration with artists and other creators, leading to incredible new opportunities for creative expression!</p>
<p>Users can rapidly create animated scenes using their own content or by mixing, matching and tweaking animated characters, assets and content created by others.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, social media has evolved from text-based posts, emojis, and photos to more visually engaging memes, video with overlays and digital drawings to provide users with the ability to express themselves more creatively than ever before. dodl.es will fuel the next big leap in self-expression, removing the barriers for digital drawing, animation, and collaboration over social media.</p>
<p>In today’s fast-paced digital world, there is increasing demand for visual communication in order to stand out. Animation is at the forefront of effective communication and expression but has historically been a time-consuming, technical process. dodl.es has simplified this process for mobile in order to help users create impressive animations faster than ever.</p>
<div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507700501/ejobd78stkvuyd7cvqlc.png"" src=""""/></div>
<div> </div>
<p>By leveraging the creative content of others through dodl.es' open marketplace, users can produce animated stories (or “dodles”) without requiring drawing or animation skills.  The user simply searches for pre-animated characters, objects, and scenes they want to add to their dodle, and selects licensed assets to tweak, if necessary.  Users can then quickly develop an animated dodle, visually directing these assets by selecting actions and recording audio for characters to lip sync.</p>
<p>dodl.es is positioning itself as an advocate for creators by offering new revenue streams for self-publishing animated stories and to license assets such as scenes, objects, characters, sound effects, music, and voice acting, while also protecting intellectual property.</p>

<p>The groundbreaking animation techniques within dodl.es  revolutionize the process of creating animated messages, memes, interactive comics, stories, games and more.

Would it not be fascinating if all of us could share our findings by means of high-quality books?</p><p>At present, publishing a book involves a large team of editors, designers, publishers and promoters.

How can I use PEN to write my book?</strong><br/>PEN is a web-based platform. Thus, installation of any software is not required. You are only required to register an account in PEN, which will allow you to start writing through the platform.</p><p><strong style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>2. What is the difference between PEN and other word processing software such as MS Word?</strong><br/>The grand majority of word processing software, including Microsoft Word, is developed for general purpose documentation. These programs usually provide plenty of basic formatting options. However, it is very difficult to achieve the level of quality that a book needs and deserves. PEN is designed specifically for writing books, providing professional results without overcomplicating the design aspects. Examples of such professional layout properties include an advanced hyphenation algorithm that produces beautifully spaced paragraphs, meticulous kerning, and automatic ligature generation that groups letters together whenever desirable.</p><p><strong>3. What is the difference between PEN and existing typesetting software, such as Adobe InDesign?</strong><br/>Existing typesetting software is usually very advanced and targets expert designers and typesetters. Its learning curves are very steep, and for this reason a writer traditionally first finishes the content and then sends this to a designer in order to obtain a book with a professional appearance. Once the typesetting is completed, the output is returned to the writer for proofreading. Frequently, this cycle is repeated multiple times before the book is actually completed. This is extremely inefficient. PEN will reverse this process: designers will first produce the templates, and then writers will use these templates when creating content. As a result, writers can at any time be able to see how the book really looks like.</p><p><strong>4. What is the difference between PEN and existing publishing solution such as Kindle Direct Publish (KDP)?</strong><br/>KDP is a traditional publishing model. When you finish writing the content in a word processor, your book is not yet ready for publish unless content layout design and typesetting have been performed, PEN is a new publishing model. You select the layout first before write directly on it. Typesetting is automatic. You will know exactly how your book looks like during writing. Once you finish writing the content, your book is in a format that is ready for publication.</p><p><strong>5. Which file formats will PEN provide?</strong><br/>PEN will support exporting to PDF and EPUB, which are the two most common eBook formats. Publishers may offer additional formats. Once a book is created in PEN, it will be stored in a 24/7 online repository, so that it can be read or modified at any time.</p><p><strong>6. Will it be possible for authors to request specific layouts?</strong><br/>Yes! Authors who wish to work with custom-made templates, or modified existing templates, will be able to request from the template designers.</p><p><strong>7.

<p><b>Why Black Faves Matters</b></p>
<p>The Nielsen Company projected that the annual buying power of African-American consumers would reach $1.1 trillion by 2015. Translation, if African-Americans were a country we would be the 16th largest country in the world. <br/><br/>So how much of that spending is done with black-owned businesses? The NAACP reported that <a href=""http://www.naacp.org/blog/entry/know-your-worth-if-we-dont-know-we-cant-grow-our-community"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""only 2 cents of every dollar an African American spends in this country goes to black owned businesses.""</a> This is a problem. </p>

<h3><strong>Just One Out Of Seven Billion Construction Blocks</strong></h3>
<p>I am an engineer (B.S. Mechanical Engineering/ B.A. German, University of Rhode Island; M.S. Material Science, University of Pittsburgh; Executive MBA, IE Business School) who has found his way to entrepreneurship.  In the automotive, industrial and aerospace industries, I have worked in some of the most exciting applications on the planet alongside some incredible teams.  Though I was born in the US, I have also lived in the Caribbean, in Canada and in Germany.  My work and leisure travels have taken me from Guatemala to Tierra del Fuego in the Americas, as well as to China, New Zealand and throughout Europe.<br/>In spite of the political and geographical boundaries, I have found that people the world over share many commonalities: a smile means the same everywhere, everyone cares about their children, everyone cares for the environment, everyone would like to ensure that tomorrow is better than today, and everyone enjoys a day in the sun!</p>
<p>     <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495409370/hhliuxbyuha2yk7bu6ln.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Welcome to a new way of thinking about the construction block! Welcome to Hadali Toys! “Hadali” means “sun” in the ancient Arawak language of the pre-Colombian Caribbean Antilles. And, who doesn’t enjoy playing in the sun! Hadali blocks promise to be the safest magnetic toy on the planet, while providing your children with an educational platform to learn about magnetism, colors, numbers and shapes, while also developing motor skills and abstract thinking.  Hadali blocks come in nine shapes with embedded magnets on all surfaces.  Some blocks have as few a six contact points, while others may have as many as 28.  Each side of the block is marked + or -, to let the user know the polarity of the surface.</p>

<p>Bring the blocks close to one another, and you find out how cool it is to build with Hadali blocks.  Unlike other laminar magnetic blocks, Hadali offers stair interlocking, which means that you are able to lock them together mid-way, one-third of the way, or one-fifth of the way.</p>
<p>Hadali blocks come in a rainbow of colors, including: gold, black, red, blue, yellow, brown, white, purple, orange, green and pink.  As time evolves, more colors may be added.</p>

<p>     Safety and environmental consciousness are integral to the Hadali design.  Our blocks integrate Polylactic Acid (PLA), neodymium magnets, a bit of arts and crafts glue and creativity (from you!).  PLA is a polymer made from sustainable, biodegradable resources such as tapioca roots, corn starch or sugar cane.  This means that we aim to protect our forests, create no carcinogens in the production process, and provide less waste when the toy is no longer needed.  Since no paint is present, as the color is integrated into the PLA, there are no interactions with Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC).  The overall size of each of the seamless blocks into which the magnets are embedded exceeds the choking hazard gauges by 10%, as illustrated below.  Did you ever step on the sharp edge of a toy at night when the lights are off? No need to worry, the corners and edges are all rounded to prevent such mishaps!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul><li>Explain how much funding you need and where it's going. Be transparent and specific-people need to trust you to want to fund you.</li></ul>
<p>Hadali has been designed for additive manufacturing/3D Printers, allowing us to create the seamless bodies of our blocks. In addition to using the funds to purchased the raw materials, we will be purchasing additional additive manufacturing machines to keep up with demand.  Our operation is based in the United States and will ship world-wide.  We will manufacture in the US with components from across the globe.</p>

<h3><strong>Where the funds go?</strong></h3>
<p>Currently, due to the support of a few contributors, this dream is ready to start a small production operation. A greater number of units delivered to you, however, would allow us to expand operations to include more equipment and raw materials.  Any funds raised would go towards the entire process: the purchase of raw materials, the production of the Hadali blocks, and the packaging and shipping, all done within the US. </p>
<p>Primarily, funding aims to purchase capital assets and assume labor costs for a team to take Hadali to the next level.  Our effort will be manufactured and packaged in the USA.  Therefore, a win for Hadali Toys is a win for everyone involved in the process, from the suppliers to the children who receive the blocks to the recipients of our charitable efforts</p>
<h3>The Giving Tree - Community Giveback</h3>
<p><strong>     Hadali Toys</strong> is more than just a company.  We aim to be a contributor to society by donating 3% of our profits back to the local community by investing in local educational programs.  Through these efforts, we hope to build more than just a toy, we hope to build a strong educational foundation in our community.</p>

</div></div>","Just One Out Of Seven Billion Construction Blocks
I am an engineer (B.S. Mechanical Engineering/ B.A. German, University of Rhode Island; M.S. Material Science, University of Pittsburgh; Executive MBA, IE Business School) who has found his way to entrepreneurship.  In the automotive, industrial and aerospace industries, I have worked in some of the most exciting applications on the planet alongside some incredible teams.  Though I was born in the US, I have also lived in the Caribbean, in Canada and in Germany.  My work and leisure travels have taken me from Guatemala to Tierra del Fuego in the Americas, as well as to China, New Zealand and throughout Europe.In spite of the political and geographical boundaries, I have found that people the world over share many commonalities: a smile means the same everywhere, everyone cares about their children, everyone cares for the environment, everyone would like to ensure that tomorrow is better than today, and everyone enjoys a day in the sun!
     
Welcome to a new way of thinking about the construction block! Welcome to Hadali Toys! “Hadali” means “sun” in the ancient Arawak language of the pre-Colombian Caribbean Antilles. And, who doesn’t enjoy playing in the sun! Hadali blocks promise to be the safest magnetic toy on the planet, while providing your children with an educational platform to learn about magnetism, colors, numbers and shapes, while also developing motor skills and abstract thinking.  Hadali blocks come in nine shapes with embedded magnets on all surfaces.  Some blocks have as few a six contact points, while others may have as many as 28.  Each side of the block is marked + or -, to let the user know the polarity of the surface.

 

Bring the blocks close to one another, and you find out how cool it is to build with Hadali blocks.  Unlike other laminar magnetic blocks, Hadali offers stair interlocking, which means that you are able to lock them together mid-way, one-third of the way, or one-fifth of the way.
Hadali blocks come in a rainbow of colors, including: gold, black, red, blue, yellow, brown, white, purple, orange, green and pink.  As time evolves, more colors may be added.


 

 

 
     Safety and environmental consciousness are integral to the Hadali design.  Our blocks integrate Polylactic Acid (PLA), neodymium magnets, a bit of arts and crafts glue and creativity (from you!).  PLA is a polymer made from sustainable, biodegradable resources such as tapioca roots, corn starch or sugar cane.  This means that we aim to protect our forests, create no carcinogens in the production process, and provide less waste when the toy is no longer needed.  Since no paint is present, as the color is integrated into the PLA, there are no interactions with Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC).  The overall size of each of the seamless blocks into which the magnets are embedded exceeds the choking hazard gauges by 10%, as illustrated below.  Did you ever step on the sharp edge of a toy at night when the lights are off? No need to worry, the corners and edges are all rounded to prevent such mishaps!


 

 
    “Whose blocks are these?”  You’ll know when you opt for the personalization of the blocks. Each block set can be personalized with your child’s name, providing a unique sense of ownership.

     “Please put away your blocks!” You’ll have such an easy time storing the Hadali blocks, because the sets of 26 or more come in a colorful lunch box. Smaller sets come in a cool recyclable cotton drawstring pouch.  Each option provides an easy and manageable way for kids to carry and store their blocks.


 

Why choose Hadali?  Compare the features with other blocks below.


 
Remember, keep it concise, yet personal. Ask yourself: if someone stopped reading here would they be ready to make a contribution?

Who is Lavaboom and what is this campaign about?
 Lavaboom is a small team of developers and designers in Cologne, Germany. 
We’ve spent the better part of last year working on an email service that protects its users' privacy instead of abusing it.  Encryption and zero knowledge are baked in, and you don't have to worry about any technical details if you don't want to.
We've been under closed beta for the past 12 months and as we're preparing a stable release, we want to give you a chance to get early access at a great price.The problem we want to solve: Your emails are like open postcardsEmail is still the number one communication tool online - 2.3 million people are sending 150 billion emails every day. 
In 2013 Edward Snowden revealed the scope of the mass surveillance of the NSA and their partners in the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. 90% of the data that NSA collects comes from coercive partnerships with Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo and other US-based email services. American companies are forced by the US law to grant access to their servers and data - databases of users, their private communication and metadata- without having a way to oppose it! If you are a client of one of the biggest email providers, your privacy is compromised. The NSA can read your emails and investigate your online activity whenever they want.
Your email is like an open postcard. And you would’t put your bank details or other sensitive, private information on a postcard, right? 
 


Status quo: Encryption is still too complicated
How can we prevent our emails from being read by third parties? By encrypting them.Email encryption used properly would prevent surveillance and take back your privacy. The main encryption technology used for email, PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), is mathematically and empirically proven to be unbreakable. It has been used by security professionals, hacktivists, journalists and governments for over 20 years. In fact, American three-letter agencies are probably using it to protect their secret communication.You may wonder then, why isn't PGP email as common as say, HTTPS websites?

What we need the money for?

In order to provide Lavaboom to the millions who deserve to be able to communicate securely, we need your help. This is how we are planning to spend the raised money:

What are the features of the Premium account?1) Larger inbox size - a 15GB bonues added to the 2GB from the supporter package.2) Custom domain support, so that you can use your @yourdomain.com with Lavaboom's email service.3) Early access to our mobile apps and native desktop applications.4) Access to experimental features in the client5) As a Premium Supporter, you'll get a direct line and contact to our CEO, Felix.About us

<p>Main pyrus dms is a document management system, which has been developed by a German team consisting of sighted and blind software developers. We aim to make everyday working practices easier for handicapped people.</p>
<p>Too many handicapped people still have no chance of taking part in professional life because the necessary software is lacking or not available at all. We want to solve this problem with our accessible software solution.</p>
<p></p>

<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Digital document management for everyone</h3> <p>Across the globe, Main pyrus is the first document management system used to manage and archive digital data, which is accessible and can easily be used by everyone. It contains a search function that makes it possible to search for documents and projects by means of using different criteria. Furhtermore, all data is archived in an audit-compliant manner and document management processes can be retraced.</p>
<p>Another unique feature is the easy handling of the software. It has been designed specifically for blind and visually handicapped people, though the easy to use nature of the software can also support people with other handicaps or elderly people who want to have a professional come-back.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>You can access the DMS with any current Internet browser. Main pyrus offers an elaborate roles and rights management to assign individual access rights for functionalities and data to a user. In addition, Main pyrus is multilingual. At the moment, our software is offered in English and German. More languages are being planned.</p>

<br/>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>How will we use your contribution?</h3> <p>With $31,000 we will be able to make our DMS publicly available to everyone using the cloud. It will finally be affordable not only for big companies, but also for private individuals, as well as micro enterprises. For that purpose, we will rent more server space to set up our system. As soon as more people find out about the campaign and get inspired by it, our project is really going to take off.</p>
<p>We still have a bigger vision that goes beyond what we have already accomplished. There are more possibilities in using Main pyrus and we need your help to reach those aims. Here are some of our stretch goals:</p>

<br/><p>We will remain true to our commitment of making inclusion possible, even if we don't reach our goal here. It will just take us much more time. More funds would also make it possible for us to expand and improve our services regarding updating and enhancing our software system. With your help, we can set an example concerning social sustainability and make inclusion in everyday working life possible.</p>

Main pyrus dms is a document management system, which has been developed by a German team consisting of sighted and blind software developers. We aim to make everyday working practices easier for handicapped people.
Too many handicapped people still have no chance of taking part in professional life because the necessary software is lacking or not available at all. We want to solve this problem with our accessible software solution.


   Digital document management for everyone Across the globe, Main pyrus is the first document management system used to manage and archive digital data, which is accessible and can easily be used by everyone. It contains a search function that makes it possible to search for documents and projects by means of using different criteria. Furhtermore, all data is archived in an audit-compliant manner and document management processes can be retraced.
Another unique feature is the easy handling of the software. It has been designed specifically for blind and visually handicapped people, though the easy to use nature of the software can also support people with other handicaps or elderly people who want to have a professional come-back.




You can access the DMS with any current Internet browser. Main pyrus offers an elaborate roles and rights management to assign individual access rights for functionalities and data to a user. In addition, Main pyrus is multilingual. At the moment, our software is offered in English and German. More languages are being planned.





    How will we use your contribution? With $31,000 we will be able to make our DMS publicly available to everyone using the cloud. It will finally be affordable not only for big companies, but also for private individuals, as well as micro enterprises. For that purpose, we will rent more server space to set up our system. As soon as more people find out about the campaign and get inspired by it, our project is really going to take off.
We still have a bigger vision that goes beyond what we have already accomplished. There are more possibilities in using Main pyrus and we need your help to reach those aims. Here are some of our stretch goals:



We will remain true to our commitment of making inclusion possible, even if we don't reach our goal here. It will just take us much more time. More funds would also make it possible for us to expand and improve our services regarding updating and enhancing our software system. With your help, we can set an example concerning social sustainability and make inclusion in everyday working life possible.



    What the press writes about Main pyrus ""Sighted users are also profiting from the easy, logical, and clear structure. The frequent 'disappearance' of data on your computer is now a thing of the past."" - Frankfurter Rundschau
""As the worldwide first and only accessible document management system, the developed product prevents barriers in the handling of digital documents."" - (idw) Informationsdienst Wissenschaft
""Workstations for handicapped people still have to be individually adjusted, which is expensive. However, that is not inclusion, meaning standard, but integration, meaning an exception, which has to be adjusted to the standard. Main IT is working on this new standard."" - IHK WirtschaftsForum
""The innovative document management system by Main IT can considerably improve the participation of handicapped employees in IT working processes. [...] It is an extremely sensible product, which can improve quality of life for many handicapped people."" - Pressemitteilung Hessisches Ministerium der Finanzen (press release of the Hessian Ministry of Finance, State Secretary Dr. Bernadette Weyland)

    Why do we need your help? In the beginning, Main pyrus was developed for companies with an extensive amount of data. Now we also want to make it possible for private users and small companies to manage their data as uncomplicated and accessible as possible. We need your help to provide enough server capacity and enable the use of the DMS in our cloud.
Consequently, not only will handicapped and elderly people be able to use a very simple data management, but everybody who is interested in it. By using crowd funding, we can ensure that our products are kept independent and therefore will be affordable for every user.

Seize the opportunity and make it your year with the FlowBook - with more clarity and focus.We all are overwhelmed with information, expectations, and distractions and feel as if we are being lived instead of pro-actively shaping our life. We've tried a myriad of approaches to solving this problem and found the simplest and most effective system to be non-digital design: Introducing the FlowBookThe FlowBook is a unique organizer that unites three parts in a beautiful cover:
The Task-Book is where you manage and tick-off your daily tasks while keeping them linked to your life goals.
The Goal-Book is where you refine and operationalize your life goals.
The Goal-Card is where you always have your life goals in sight. 
With the FlowBook you only need three minutes a day to balance your daily routine with your desires for your life.  How it works (only 3 minutes daily)In the Task-Book note three tasks for the day designed to make the day a good one for you. Do that daily at the same time and before anything else, e.g. while sipping your first cup of coffee (see picture below).Next, consider which life goal is supported by each task. The Goal-Card with its simple symbols helps you do this.This short reflection brings clarity to what you have been living for so far. With the three tasks, you are prepared for the day with a clear focus. Weekly 5-Minute-ReviewSundays the Task-Book will ask you to do a 5-Minute-Review of the goals you´ve been working on lately by scanning the last pages. You then pivot to a life goal that holds more value and plan at least one corresponding task for the following week. Elaborating your life goalsThe Goal-Book helps you cultivate your life goals to become clear on where you actually want to go. And the goal-oriented tasks make sure that you get there.Once a week set some time aside to elaborate on your life goals. Choose one, that you haven´t thought through yet, elaborate it, define sub-goals and tasks for it, and keep them all in your Goal-Book. The benefits of the FlowBookAfter three weeks you will get a much better sense of what you are spending your precious time on and naturally will start to scrutinize your habits and focus more on the things that really matter to you.That is why it is so powerful and effective: It´s easy to use and the learning and change happen automatically and without any extra effort. The only rule is that you have to use it daily for at least three weeks to start the ripple effect.Each Task-Book has space for 8 weeks. After that simply replace it with a fresh one in seconds. Your Goal-Book and your Goal-Card is meant to stay. They are your stable set of goals that you sharpen and refine over time. It´s simple, powerful, and elegant.A spring bar made of stainless steel with a Swiss watchmaker´s precision replaces the typical ring mechanism. Our books have a stainless steel tube on the spine and are easily clipped into the spring rail. The advantage is obvious: You can turn the pages easily, write more comfortably, and changing the inlays works like a charm.Replacing paper in the FlowBook takes two seconds! Our FlowBook is flatter than any ring binder and much more comfortable to write. We produce everything by hand in Germany and we even produce our own special paper because we want you to get the best.  This ring binder (left) and the FlowBook (right) have the same writing estate. The FlowBook comes with three convenient metal clips, that help you to always find the right page immediately.It's laid out in A6 landscape format to perfectly fit where you need it, e.g. in front of your workstation.Here is our blog article with all the information for notebook experts incl. downloadable PDFs with the interior design of the Task-Book and the Goal-Book.It´s sustainableThe FlowBook is built to last.

I'm a
 design engineer located in Central Florida. This is the newest Dozer 
Gear product design project as we continue to get the Dozer Gear brand 
and business launched. Using Kickstarter to launch our product allows to
 broaden our product line as we transition to a full online retailer.<br/><br/><p>While we are neither the first nor the last Crowdfunding project to make 
magnets we think the DG-MAG magnets are by far the coolest. You can use 
them on any ferrous metal object such as your refrigerator, toolbox or 
locker to stick and metal pin notes or pictures. DG-MAG makes a great

<p>New gender-equal opportunities for girls and women are (rightfully!) appearing daily. To prepare for these new opportunities, young girls are venturing alone across the Internet. They know there are opportunities out there and they're determined to find them. But they need help understanding what they're looking for and where to look.</p>
<p>Most guidance is taught at home so I designed my project to use everyday digital-device connections between parents and daughters to help parents steer daughters in the right direction.

You know that you shouldn’t drive and text. It’s just too dangerous! You know you shouldn’t ride a bike and text. It’s too dangerous! You know you shouldn’t walk and text. Well, walking and texting are as dangerous but bad things can happen when you’re not paying attention to where you’re going!
But seriously, texting while doing anything else is not safe. And, what makes it even worst is that the average text user uses THREE messaging apps if she’s in Europe or the USA and SIX if she’s in Asia! Really? Yes! Not to mention all of the app-surfing that has most users spending 36 hours a week jumping back and forth between 27 different apps! 
Enough! Can we make texting easier? And safer?
Yes, we can. With YOUR help we can make it happen!  
Introducing the Text Message App Changing the Way We Text
Introducing Mingo, the app that will change  how you and everyone else texts by making text messaging easier and a bit safer.

apps together into one easy-to-use app! No more text app surfing! And this
means that you won’t need to jump from text app to text app to read all of your

<p><strong>Wool mill in Iceland</strong><br/>Hi we are Guðrún Lilja og Brynjar Þór on Gilhagi farm in far north Iceland, near the arctic circle. We recently moved to Brynjars family farm with our 2 daughters. We are building up our future here with animals and nature and our goal is to make our full living here on the farm. We aim to be as sustainable as possible in work, food, energy and environmental footprint. After we moved to Gilhagi with our old cat, we´ve gotten ourself a few sheeps and a dog, the basic farmlife startpack. But at the farm we have been keeping bees for few years, we‘ve got now 2 beehives. Our project now is to open a woolmill here on the farm. We will buy wool from our local region and spin it to a great knitting yarn. We aim to make wool more valuable to farmers. The yarn will be high quality pure icelandic yarn. Not blended with other fibers. Your contribution will help us to buy specialized wool machines from Canada.<br/><strong>Our yarn</strong><br/>We will make high quality pure icelandic yarn from our farming neighbours here in the northern region of Iceland. It will be in all shapes and form. From thin to bulky, tight or loose woven. We need machines from Canada to make our yarn. We are aiming to raise $25.000 which is not totaly enough for the machines but it will help us much. Since this crowdfund is flexible we will get our raised fund so every little contribution will help us.<br/>Our perks are of all sorts of yarn and wool, clothing from our yarn, photography from around our farm, handcrafted goods, planting trees and many other thing.<br/><strong>The project</strong><br/>Our woolmill will make different for us, our farming neighbors and knitters. We will be able to work at home, farmers will get more value for their wool and knitters will get high quality pure yarn which is desirable and much sought after. It is soft and warm, where lambswool is softer than from their mothers. We will use lamb and sheeps wool. We will get all types of wool, soft to rough which all can be used for different types of product. We will try to limit the waste of wool. So every workable fiber will be used.<br/>Parallel to the mill we will open a visitor centre where our product will be sold and visitors can come to learn about sheepherding through out icelandic history mainly focused on their fleece usage. The icelandic sheep has played a very important role in keeping icelanders alive since they settled the island around the year 874. Visitors can also walk around Gilhagi´s farm to admire the nature and forestry with more than 50 different tree species and enjoy the beautiful landscape, scenery and stillness.<br/><strong>Icelandic wool</strong><br/>The icelandic sheep has unique high quality fleece of double fiber coat named tog and thel, that can be separated. Thel is closest to their skin, short fluffy fibers that is soft, warm and insulating. Thel is softer then tog while tog is the weather coat, long coarsed hair and water repellent. The icelandic sheep has many beautiful color variations and we intend to use them undyed or use natural herb dyeing technique from localy sourced material. Pure icelandic yarn has been hard to get on a regular basis in large quantities, but with this mill access will be easier.<br/><strong>The journey</strong><br/>To get the machines we will need to get a loan. Your contribuition in all shapes will help us much. We aim to be able to order the machines this spring and hopefully get everything set up and working this summer. We will change the farm workshop to house the mill but that all will be ready in the beginning of summer.</p>
<p><strong>Can you help?</strong><br/>We hope you can help us in one way or another.<br/>If you are not able to donate you can help us by sharing this with everyone you know.<br/>You can share on Facebook or other media, send people you know E-mail.

From the living room to the bathroom and beyond, out into the world, no matter where you decide to go, you can count on technology to simplify any task and keep you connected to the services and people you need.</p>
<p>In this trend, we have developed a mobile app for on-demand laundry service. It’s called Washitto, and it’s designed to make it easier for you to get laundry delivered when you need it. Whereas other laundry services are unreliable and slow, Washitto is the promising revolution. Top-quality laundry service is just a few clicks away. The rates are fixed for small and large bags. Dry cleaning, tailoring, membership and rewards programs are also offered. This app is simultaneously going to create new, flexible jobs and make the process of doing your laundry more convenient!</p>

<p>After my last job, looking to have some sort of absentee business, I considered purchasing a laundromat. After heavy research and making a business plan, I got the idea of creating a laundry app to market the existing business. A few months later, after researching and testing other delivery services, I decided to jump in the venture of pursuing my tech side and create my first mobile app. That’s when Washitto was born, an on-demand laundry service, that is based on a per bag rate with instant pick up and delivery in 6 hours or less. Food and e-commerce industries offer 2 hour delivery, why doesn’t laundry?</p>
<p>After gathering the ideas and current issues in the laundry industry, I started to design the UI/UX of the mobile app. I started spreading the word by going to networking events and everyone told me that this was a great idea. So instead of buying a laundromat, I began development in June. The app is currently 85% done, but we want to take it to the next level. Instead of just having it locally, we want to expand to other major cities. That’s why we are turning to all the people that hate doing laundry.</p>

</div></div>","Technology is changing all around us, advances popping up at an unprecedented rate. It has gotten to the point that it is expected for life to get easier day after day and offer us greater levels of comfort. From the living room to the bathroom and beyond, out into the world, no matter where you decide to go, you can count on technology to simplify any task and keep you connected to the services and people you need.
In this trend, we have developed a mobile app for on-demand laundry service. It’s called Washitto, and it’s designed to make it easier for you to get laundry delivered when you need it. Whereas other laundry services are unreliable and slow, Washitto is the promising revolution. Top-quality laundry service is just a few clicks away. The rates are fixed for small and large bags. Dry cleaning, tailoring, membership and rewards programs are also offered. This app is simultaneously going to create new, flexible jobs and make the process of doing your laundry more convenient!

The Laundry industry has been the same for more than 2 decades. Most local laundromats offer drop-off but not pick-up, delivery, customizable, and personalized laundry service, when you want it and how you want it.  
Some of the issues include;

Lack of Time
Lack of Resources
Not all Laundromats are open 24/7
No rush service under 8 hours
Non-personalized logistics
Scarcity of details on how you want your laundry done. 
 Laundry service is just a few clicks away! True on demand service so you don’t have to call or walk over to your local laundromat to place your order.  User friendly interface that allows you to get your laundry picked up Right NOW! The UI also lets you to modify delivery options even after you placed your order. At a flat-rate, you don't have to worry about being charged per pound or hidden fees. The fixed rates are $39 for a small bag and $49 for a large bag. This is an exclusive offer for backers on Indiegogo.           We are turning to the people on Indiegogo, those that hate doing laundry in order to crowdfund twenty grand. Every contribution will help us expand our business to major cities, pre-sell the service, and finish our app development. We will focus first on the major markets and expand Washitto into areas worldwide. As a thank you, we are offering some exciting rewards to our contributors, including exclusive beta access to Washitto App and branded merchandise, perfect for advertising your support for the app.

I am so glad that I stumbled on the Naturally Empowered planner.""•  ""The planner is so well thought out and a true guide, no matter what one's situation might be. And I love the wellness tips and quotes -- they are helping me take care of my mind and body in ways I may not have without the gentle reminders and realize the ways in which I should feel proud of the healthy choices I'm making.""  Our Goal

From the time that you open the box to the time that you start printing, no more than ten minutes should have passed, all the parts that you need fully assembled and the instructions making your role totally clear.We have committed ourselves to a lofty goal – altering the face of the 3D printing world – and we intend to follow through on the plan that we have laid out here. Bringing together a diverse collection of experts and masters, we intend on becoming the new face of 3D printing by doing for this technology what Microsoft did for the PC and what Facebook did for social media, drawing in people who would otherwise think that this technology is “not for them.”    Made in Switzerland, this printer is a reliable piece of hardware, and thanks to wireless charging and Bluetooth / Wifi connections, there are no cables to worry about either. The print volume is enormous compared to our competitors' products, saving you money and time. Quiet, precise, and effective, Forge 1 is truly the printer that is going to bring 3D printing into homes around the world.    What We Need & What You Get  We have come to you, Indiegogo, for help raising CHF 50,000. These funds will cover the costs of manufacturing, marketing, and distributing the initial run of Forge 1 printers, getting this cutting-edge product into homes and offices everywhere. As a thank-you, we have put together some killer deals as rewards for our contributors.  The ImpactForge 1 is going to fast-track 3D printing into the mainstream. Right now, the majority of consumers have access to this technology only indirectly, but with this printer, all of that is about to change. Forge 1 is a printer that people will pick up easily and take to immediately. This is a printer destined to make a big splash.In this short Video you see the self test that Forge 1 does to its Z-axis, which is succeful when the vibrations sensors do not register anomalous vibrations, which would compromise the print quality.   
 Slicing   Explanations to the video belowThe most important premise first:Forge 1 utilises daylight resin, and normally is totally black inside it.The only way to film Forge 1 in action, was to open the doors wide open, to demount the lower front part for having a decent viewing angle.After that, we put the platform much higher than the normal starting position (which is in the VAT), otherwise, you would not be able to see the tablet, projecting light from below the VAT and for the same reason it is empty.Last but not least, we unmounted some components, that would allow professionals (competitors), to understand some discoveries we made.",8.0,3,"1 Campaign

It is our favorite word and therefore our favorite thing in the multiverse! mumu is a colorful, clever, fair & eco-effective notebook and sketchbook! Various color combinations just make life more fun and the minimal design helps you to find cool friends.No matter how chaotic or structured you organize, write, draw, paint, collect, procrastinate and learn, due to the modular workflow and free grid-printables you can customize mumu imperfectly or perfectly the way you work.Regional production in a socially-oriented organization (sheltered Workshop) in Berlin and carefully selected materials are just two of many reasons why we are starting very well. In terms of function, mumu is the best modular notebook we can imagine, but we want to work with you to create the fairest and most eco-effective mumu of all time.Big plus: We also think of the neighborhood (figuratively)! 1 € per notebook will be reinvested into cultural projects, cradle to cradle education and the eco & fairness improvement of mumu. We will be absolutely transparent by showing you how we use your financial superpower in order to achieve our goals!With this campaign we want to finance our first production, set up our own online shop and finally get in contact with you! Hello World!In simple words: It's two metal clips that hold together an cover with 120 pages. With the clever foldback-mechanism, you can fold away the cover in a space-saving and ergonomic way. Stabilize mumu, by installing the supplied cardboard (stiffer). Also, in order to free the world of some advertising, we will deliberately renounced the product branding of the notebooks themselves. Yeah!Whether you draw your first line in the front, middle or back, thanks to mumu’s modular approach you can finally control the flow of your work. Your notebook, your workflow. Your mother (or father)! Detach the foldback-clips and ...mumu - GRIDS | FREE & CUSTOMIZED PRINTABLESmumu & mu come to you with empty pages. So if you love to work with blank pages, you will be very happy! For those who prefer black and colored dots, lines, checks and grids, we have developed 3888 free printables based on five grids.Why should you squeeze your handwriting into a fixed distance, if you can adjust the line spacing to your handwriting? With our ""gridfitter""-form you can find the best line spacing for your writing and reading. Grid It Yourself | Create your own frameworkFor those who can not get enough of checklists, diaries, weekly schedules, bullet journals, storyboards, portfolios, youtube comments, and other organization-psychoses: use your image editing and text software to create brand-new grids and share / play around with them! We don't tell you how life should be beyond good.ECO & FAIR | INSPIRED BY CRADLE TO CRADLE AND ALL THE OTHER GOOD STUFF!We want to leave a positive footprint on our planet (it's the only one we have). The Cradle to Cradle design concept guides and inspires us significantly. The use of renewable energies, carbon management, the use of safe ingredients, a positive wastewater management as well as fair working conditions along the supply value chain plays all a central role for mumu and us. In addition, we have developed mumu for recycling and material–just from the beginning!So far so good, but we are not perfect yet. That's why we use your financial energy and reinvest some of our profits to achieve our long-term goal of 100% eco effectiveness, fairness and cultural diversity. For those who are interested, below you find the details of our goals!DESIGN, FAIR & ECO does not have to mean expensive at the same time. With price transparency and high ecological and social requirements, we are cheaper than similar notebooks that are produced in China...like möleschkintsz for example : ). Yes, we just do not earn as much because it is more important to us that you get a very good notebook for a good price! We want to send efficient parcels around the world, so we reward you with a volume discount. The larger the mumu & mu package is, the cheaper the shipping will be and therefore the final price.In addition a pioneer discount applies exclusively to this campaign– because boy/girl scouts are to be rewarded! mumu & mu ANNUAL SUBSCRIPTIONSThe first notebook subscription of the multiverse! Have you found the perfect notebook with us and want to use your power of thought for anything but shopping? Perfekto! Pay once and get mumu or mu for a whole year!It`s easy:The 12 months subscription starts on the first delivery date and ends with the last delivery. So you do not have to worry about annoying renewal, just like it should be with a subscription! One month before the expiration we will come to you and ask if you would like to extend your subscription –common automatism does not exist with us.THE FOUR SEASON ANNUAL SUBSCRIPTION for mumu (A4) OR mu (A5) :+ 12x mumu /mu  within 12 months + 2x mumu /mu every second months (6 packages) + Choose your favorite colors+ Without extension trapTHE BELIEVER LIFETIME SUBSCRIPTIONOur crowdfunding special! You have a tremendous willpower and a powerful drive to change the analogous world of work, you believe in change and therefore want to set an example...then YOU ARE A BELIEVER! Exclusively we award 4 lifetime subscriptions for mumu. That means you will get the notebooks of your choice every two month until the end of your life!  You will always be up to date, wherever you are: From the Antarctic Research Station to the deepest jungle in Colombia - from Bottrop to Manchester! We provide you with mumu until you become a nutrient yourself. To pick up your first mumu and to sign your contract, we invite you to Berlin to our studio! Here you will get to know us, the production, and all those involved in mumu ...and spend a damn funny weekend together!+ 6x mumu (A4) and/or mu (A5) within 12 months+ 1x notebook every second months (6 packages within one year)+ Choose your favorite colors+ Until the end of your life!

10 Reasons to support the SoundKey

SoundKey is the first device of its kind
SoundKey is backed-up by private investors: even if we don’t reach our preorder goal, you will get yours when we will start shipping
You can brand with your own logo thanks to our whitebox option (minimum order apply)
SoundKey comes with a development kit, to integrate its features to any app and website!
SoundKey can be used with any crypto currencies and other digital signatures (more signature algorithms will be implemented with time)
SoundKey can encrypt and decrypt any kind of data (size limit apply based on model)
SoundKey keeps your private key physically out of reach from malicious programs and people, as it NEVER leaves the device (the signature and encryption/decryption take place IN the device)
The top model of SoundKey can encrypt voice messages, without supplementary software, to be decrypted by a specific public key, and thanks to the audio connections, the encrypted messages can be sent via email, IM, or other apps.
SoundKey can be used to identify users on websites or over the phone
Oh, and it talks :)


A key should fit in your wallet. 
A portable cryptographic device would be rather useless if you needed a backpack to carry it. Weighing only a few grams and with no more surface than a credit card, you can keep the SoundKey at the ready, with you at any time. 

A key should be easy to use. 
SoundKey is nearly as easy to use as a physical key. Each action it performs only takes a couple of steps, and the device quickly integrates into your everyday life, almost frictionless. 

A SoundKey should do much more (and it does!)The SoundKey opens many doors, you decide which. For your business, for private use, for digital signature or encryption, its uses are many and all guaranteed safe.

I don't mean to channel Jerry Maguire...hold on yes I do.. Help your mentors so they can help you. I will say that again, help your mentors so they can help you. Don't go up to the person you want to be your mentor and ask them ""how do I become successful?"" That is an extremely broad question and also shows that you are being lazy. Try to hone in on what your next step should be. Ask how they would navigate through a specific problem you are currently facing. Make every word count because time is precious for both of you. If you are reading this you are already a motivated individual, prove that you are serious about your success and do some research before you approach your mentor and they will be able to fill the gaps on your canvas... not paint the entire picture for you.</div><div> </div><div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528405352/dbgzjrrstazt1qciez7i.png"" src=""""/></div><p> </p><p><strong>Pass the Torch Podcast- Official Podcast of Mentorch Inc.</strong></p><p> </p><div><div><div>

You will see my life and business as we build the next tech startup, some of the most notable vlogs to date are below and the others can be found on YouTube! Tay's Day Vlog 013Mentorch had an amazing opportunity to go all they way up to the Big City ( New York City) to be exact and pitch to the CEO of Vaynermedia, Gary Vaynerchuk. It was an awesome experience for Aileen and Bekah and the entire team was excited to be associated with it. We talked to Gary about our company and even gave him an official Mentorch T-shirt. Mentorch is about mentorship and mentorship is about leaving a legacy. We could not have imagined being able to talk to an awesome legacy maker like Gary so early in our journey but we are thankful for the interaction and we will continue to work hard to take Mentorch to the next level.-Tay Santos and the Mentorch Team   Mentorship is not just for the board room... Mentorship is not just for people who wear fancy suits and work in board rooms. Anyone can benefit from a good mentorship relationship. Mentorch will help you see how fun it can be to be in a mentorship relationship and most importantly, how meaningful it can be.   Tay's Day Vlog 019:This vlog features a little behind the scenes of what it is like to be the founder of Mentorch. I show you some podcast content, a majority of it shows an insider meeting with the tech team as we do a dive into the functionality and design of Mentorch. It is very important that we get this right and we can not wait to make sure we are getting you the very best experience possible. I am extremely humbled to be able to work with such a motivated, diverse and passionate team. I know we can and will bring you a platform you'll be glad to spend your time on and feel PRODUCTIVE because of it. We need your help to make it a reality and you have come to the right place to help us!  Mentors really do want to help you... The truth is there are alot of mentors out there who want to help you but you need to come to the table with a game plan. I don't mean to channel Jerry Maguire...hold on yes I do.. Help your mentors so they can help you. I will say that again, help your mentors so they can help you. Don't go up to the person you want to be your mentor and ask them ""how do I become successful?"" That is an extremely broad question and also shows that you are being lazy. Try to hone in on what your next step should be. Ask how they would navigate through a specific problem you are currently facing. Make every word count because time is precious for both of you. If you are reading this you are already a motivated individual, prove that you are serious about your success and do some research before you approach your mentor and they will be able to fill the gaps on your canvas... not paint the entire picture for you.  Pass the Torch Podcast- Official Podcast of Mentorch Inc. 

 
Pass the Torch podcast is really special to me because I am able to talk to really amazing people, record it and share it with the world. I remember always having these amazing conversations but I was never able to share it with other people directly but now I can. Every time I meet someone who is on their own path and doing great things I want to share their story. I believe that each and every one of us has a story and value we can offer to the world. Pass the Torch Podcast is my small portal to do that. I hope to talk with you one day and if the stars align maybe I will have the honor to have you on the show. Until then remember to Seek Knowledge, and Pass the Torch!-Tay SantosPass the Torch Podcast: Episode 21 with Brandy Morgan (@brandymorgan)

The CEO, Francis Castillo de Mulert, developed EasyPlug as a final project that morphed into the product now. The prototype is currently being built by SWYM, an engineering firm based out of Boise, Idaho. Please find their work at this link: <a href=""https://swym.consulting/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://swym.consulting/</a>. Once the product undergoes FCC testing, EasyPlug will transition to the production and mass manufacturing phase with Hong Kong-based Morpho MFG. Please check out their latest updates at this link: <a href=""https://www.morphomfg.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.morphomfg.com/</a>. In the ""What We Need &amp; What You Get"" paragraph, we discuss the significance of partnering with Morpho MFG.</p><h3>About Us</h3><p>Founder and Owner, Francis Castillo de Mulert recently graduated with a Bachelor's of Science degree from the United States Military Academy at West Point and is currently serving as an Armor Officer. As a Psychology Major,  he was fortunate to take an entrepreneurship course offered by the Business Management Department at USMA. Although Francis had always dreamt of creating his own company, he did not necessarily have the tools to begin. The idea of incorporating wireless charging technology into the everyday office space went from a mere school project to reality. Francis has partnered with Jason Brodeur who is currently serving as our Chief Financial Officer. Jason also plays a huge role in evaluating our concepts and prototypes, ensuring that the device is meeting our goal of increasing workspace efficiency.  Lastly, Hannah Stith serves as our Social Media Marketing Specialist, assisting EasyPlug to better reach our consumers via the internet.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1608757454/yxnjt8ln3kgx44rugw4f.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3> </h3><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>In total, we are asking for $60,000 USD to accomplish tasks that are necessary to put EasyPlug devices on the market for office cubicles or home offices. To be specific, we will need $6,000 to complete our prototyping milestone 2 as well as an additional $6,000 for FCC testing and certification. Depending on the costs of materials, it will roughly cost between $15,000 and $20,000 to conduct mass manufacturing. As of now, we will be partnering with Morpho Manufacturing out of Hong Kong. They offer a unique three-phase system of manufacturing that will benefit EasyPlug by allowing Morpho to act as a third party to find the best materials and manufacturing processes for our product. We estimate a cost of $10,000 to ship our first set of devices from Hong Kong. Lastly, we anticipate a $10,000 fee to create and receive approval of a patent. We are including an additional $13,000 USD for unanticipated expenses to include contingencies for issues we may run into with prototyping, manufacturing and shipping.</p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>If you decide to back our campaign, you are helping our dream become a reality. As of now in our early stages, we have decided as a team that we would prefer not to approach angel investors in order to keep our team organic in nature. Our organization is comprised of some of the youngest leaders in the nation, quite literally. Hence, it is in our best interest to not stray away from our original path which will allow us to maintain our vision of reducing cord clutter in your workspace.</p><p>By donating to our campaign, not only you will have a stake in the charge to pioneer wireless charging, but you will be able to receive first access to our devices as they roll onto the market.</p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p>The challenges and risks  of this venture go hand in hand. The risk for the EasyPlug team is that to get to this point, we have spent considerable hours and money with the possibility that we will lose all of our investment.

With interchangeable tiles that can declutter your mass of cables to wirelessly charge your smartphone, EasyPlug's model is your silver bullet.  The ""Cast-E-O"" consists of four interchangeable and customizable tiles that cover your workspace. You can write on it as easily as you do your normal desk, charge your wireless device, control your mouse on the perfect surface, and charge any of your plug-in devices simultaneously, without the hassle of cables. Each tile utilizes a mesh electrical system that distributes energy throughout the mat. Did we also mention it’s waterproof? *Note: The monitor is not included with the sale of this product. Different VersionsWe have three versions of the Cast-E-O: Entry, Intermediate and Advanced.The Entry-Level Cast-E-O is designed for everyday use and not necessarily directed to the office space. It includes two Qi Wireless Charging tiles and a USB port.The Intermediate-Level offers two Qi Wireless Charging tiles, a USB port, as well as a keyboard and mousepad tile.The Advanced-Level is the all-encompassing version including four Qi Wireless Charging tiles, a  USB port, the keyboard and mousepad tile, as well as a drink warming tile for your coffee cup to ensure it does not become cold. Lastly, you can personally customize the skin of the Advanced-Level EasyCharge to a logo or design of your choice.All three levels include your choice of a variety of base and trim colors. Designed For Your DeskEach tile is six inches long and wide, with limitless customization to fit your desk. Whether you have multiple devices, multiple screens, or a simple set-up, EasyPlug will simplify your workplace. If you’re tired of the cable clutter underneath your desk or you are worried about the hidden fire hazard, EasyPlug has a solution for you.  Design and ProductionEasyPlug is the result of an entrepreneurial class in college. The CEO, Francis Castillo de Mulert, developed EasyPlug as a final project that morphed into the product now. The prototype is currently being built by SWYM, an engineering firm based out of Boise, Idaho. Please find their work at this link: https://swym.consulting/. Once the product undergoes FCC testing, EasyPlug will transition to the production and mass manufacturing phase with Hong Kong-based Morpho MFG. Please check out their latest updates at this link: https://www.morphomfg.com/. In the ""What We Need & What You Get"" paragraph, we discuss the significance of partnering with Morpho MFG.About UsFounder and Owner, Francis Castillo de Mulert recently graduated with a Bachelor's of Science degree from the United States Military Academy at West Point and is currently serving as an Armor Officer. As a Psychology Major,  he was fortunate to take an entrepreneurship course offered by the Business Management Department at USMA. Although Francis had always dreamt of creating his own company, he did not necessarily have the tools to begin. The idea of incorporating wireless charging technology into the everyday office space went from a mere school project to reality. Francis has partnered with Jason Brodeur who is currently serving as our Chief Financial Officer. Jason also plays a huge role in evaluating our concepts and prototypes, ensuring that the device is meeting our goal of increasing workspace efficiency.  Lastly, Hannah Stith serves as our Social Media Marketing Specialist, assisting EasyPlug to better reach our consumers via the internet.  What We Need & What You GetIn total, we are asking for $60,000 USD to accomplish tasks that are necessary to put EasyPlug devices on the market for office cubicles or home offices. To be specific, we will need $6,000 to complete our prototyping milestone 2 as well as an additional $6,000 for FCC testing and certification. Depending on the costs of materials, it will roughly cost between $15,000 and $20,000 to conduct mass manufacturing. As of now, we will be partnering with Morpho Manufacturing out of Hong Kong. They offer a unique three-phase system of manufacturing that will benefit EasyPlug by allowing Morpho to act as a third party to find the best materials and manufacturing processes for our product. We estimate a cost of $10,000 to ship our first set of devices from Hong Kong. Lastly, we anticipate a $10,000 fee to create and receive approval of a patent. We are including an additional $13,000 USD for unanticipated expenses to include contingencies for issues we may run into with prototyping, manufacturing and shipping.The ImpactIf you decide to back our campaign, you are helping our dream become a reality. As of now in our early stages, we have decided as a team that we would prefer not to approach angel investors in order to keep our team organic in nature. Our organization is comprised of some of the youngest leaders in the nation, quite literally. Hence, it is in our best interest to not stray away from our original path which will allow us to maintain our vision of reducing cord clutter in your workspace.By donating to our campaign, not only you will have a stake in the charge to pioneer wireless charging, but you will be able to receive first access to our devices as they roll onto the market.Risks & ChallengesThe challenges and risks  of this venture go hand in hand. The risk for the EasyPlug team is that to get to this point, we have spent considerable hours and money with the possibility that we will lose all of our investment. Our team is composed of recent college graduates who are all working full-time jobs, as well as pursuing higher educations. Our biggest challenge is we lack the funds to move forward with our concept. Currently, SWYM and EasyPlug have researched the proper methods to create the device. However, our second (and more expensive) phase, to actually begin prototyping, is what is holding us up due to limited monetary resources.  Even though we are busy with our young adult lives, we have determined a course of action that allows us to balance our day job along with this entrepreneurial venture. TimelineMarch 2020: The idea of EasyPlug came to fruition.June 2020: SWYM and EasyPlug conduct milestones 1 of researching prototype. July-November 2020: Establishing Online Presence; Marketing via IG, working on IGG draft, developing a company website.December 2020: EasyPlug IGG campaign launched.February 2021: IGG campaign complete, tentatively have funds to complete milestone 2 and to develop a working prototype.Spring 2021 begin manufacturing journey with Morpho MFG. Late Spring/Early Summer 2021 begin shipping and selling productOther Ways You Can HelpIf you cannot financially donate to our campaign, we completely understand.

Mouse Pad is offered in black and nude colorways.</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540230153/wvxioqn5uqib6xnhrkrl.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>We chose the best hide to achieve the ideal thickness, strength, and appearance. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536609303/qdbj17wfqepurilyeyy2.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536623906/jiqbnt5wlad4f9w88pvp.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>This leather mouse pad is vegetable-tanned allowing for a beautiful weathering patina over time. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536365353/ft5vzcggwhycdptdsnul.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536623925/tfz3reaz3trzxtjyzhef.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Elegant embossed logo finished with an embedded anodized aluminum ring</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536609342/pvb8muoprx4vji3dsjwb.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536623952/molcru5motfhxqyn273m.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The backing of the mouse pad is insulated with a thin polyurethane layer to reduce slipping and improve stability.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536367969/s5ng1eezospf0zgrafq4.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536623970/uadfdo80wqwbesib3k7y.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536362835/dyerqs3guxr3veu5pttr.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">BLACK</p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536362849/hndwortjuh6wfmzwvpiy.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">NUDE</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536623987/d8d78lbzzkeylhvx5wrk.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536624005/wnmgeejtdwda7hbvcya0.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536624025/g1l5wmvxrd9ulxegjvd8.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536624042/tdzqswx1udx6awnl2kha.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536624076/onjyfy6ven0laehtlh4g.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>RETRO COMPACT KEYBOARD (RCK)</strong></p><p><b>Q.

Hex bolts are added for structural enhancements and to add an industrial vintage feel.   The scroll wheel design starts with a high-grade aluminum rod that is knurled into a diamond-shaped pattern and completed with chamfered edges on a precision CNC lathe. It is then anodized to enhance aesthetics and durability.   The PixArt PAW3805 sensor is designed to track flawlessly on virtually any surface, including glass and other high-gloss materials.   Mouse setting controls are located on the bottom side.

Works on Bluetooth enabled devices natively but also includes a USB-RF receiver for computers without Bluetooth.   Built-in is a high-capacity 1,000mAh lithium-ion rechargeable battery. Usage is up to 4 months on a single charge.   Charging the mouse is simplified with USB Type-C port. Unlike older USB ports, the connector doesn’t have to be inserted in only one direction.    This mouse does not discriminate between left or right-handed users.

<p>This project is to bring the Art of the Gaming enthusiast community to the rest of the world through the world's lightest RGB wireless gaming mouse. This mouse is for those who appreciate custom designs, are interested in modding and DIY projects, the look and feel of custom PCs and enthusiast gaming gear. The Ultra Custom is your entry point into the hobby and world of enthusiast gaming and modding.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579329863/tl2bqkimawnbobmc8ybt.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Just like a fine tuned engine for a race car driver and custom athletic footwear for a sprinter; there are nuances in a gaming mouse that can enhance a gamer's performance and speak to their persona. We have designed a custom gaming mouse incorporating the latest technology, trends and feedback of the top mouse enthusiasts and pro gaming communities. Here's a summary of the key features we have incorporated into our mouse that will enable anyone to make a custom personalized high end mouse themselves.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579634431/v9dnjb78mvweseicr3ux.png"" src=""""/></p>

<h2><strong>Features</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Ultralight weight design</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579329924/gjhtyqgiwa7qjbhbadbi.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>The Ultra Custom is currently the lightest RGB wireless gaming mouse available on the market at ~66 to 73 grams. Other highend wireless gaming mice on the market weigh around 80 grams. The honeycomb design is based on enthusiasts modding and 3D printing weight reduced shells. The honeycomb shell design enables an ultra light weight while maintaining a structurally strong design. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579329960/klrdzyx1un3d3q1eghye.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>You will also have the option to lower weight down further to 58 grams in full wired mode. But why wired mode? For enthusiasts, they want to eliminate any tracking lag from their input devices and that means typical wireless mice have about 12–18 ms of lag which can be seen and felt in game - skating, delayed or floating feeling. The Ultra Custom has a 1ms USB report rate, optimized MCU and latest R&amp;D wireless technology making input lag virtually negligible. You will not be able to distinguish the difference between the Ultra Custom in wireless vs wired mode.</p>
<p>Our Ultra Flexible Type C wired Cables were developed so that even in wired mode, the Ultra Custom will feel almost wireless. Plus, custom matching cables on a mouse enhances the bespoke look and feel of a matching themed battle station. </p>
<p><strong>Ergonomic Design</strong></p>
<p>Based on a proven ergonomic shape, the Ultra Custom is suitable for small to large hands. The mouse will enable gamers to play for hours without wrist aches or hand pains. With 100% PTFE skate feet, the Ultra Custom glides buttery smooth.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Ultra Flexible Type C Wired Cable System</strong></p>
<p>Enthusiasts are usually sick of the stiff heavy cables plaguing typical gaming mice on the market. The stiff cables add to the resistance and friction between the gaming mouse wire and their mouse pad. Enthusiasts have been for years iterating different designs to have the lightest and most flexible cables in order to reduce drag and friction on their mouse movements.</p>
<p>We have developed an FCC compliant cable that is on par with a fully custom paracord cable. You will be able to select from a range of different colored cables for Wired Gaming mode. Modders, DIY and enthusiasts usually order these custom paracord cables for as much as $20 and then proceed to open their mouse and replace and install the cable themselves for both aesthetic and performance reasons.</p>
<p>With our cable system, you can have a custom ultra flexible cable with matching colors to your gaming setup with out all the hassle - simply select a cable and plug it into your mouse. USB-C is the emerging standard for charging and transferring data. The Ultra Custom is perhaps the only type-C wireless rechargeable high end gaming mouse -  you can quickly charge to full power in under 1 Hr. Get up to 66 Hours before re-charging.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Mouse Shell Cover &amp; Button Customization </strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579330078/tko9irylvpbeybsdnoxp.png"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>Enthusiasts take great lengths to optimize and personalize their mouse by disassembling them, modding them and repainting the cover shells. You can now simply select different shell finishes and tool-lessly replace the button and top shell covers in seconds.

This project is to bring the Art of the Gaming enthusiast community to the rest of the world through the world's lightest RGB wireless gaming mouse. This mouse is for those who appreciate custom designs, are interested in modding and DIY projects, the look and feel of custom PCs and enthusiast gaming gear. The Ultra Custom is your entry point into the hobby and world of enthusiast gaming and modding.
 

 
Just like a fine tuned engine for a race car driver and custom athletic footwear for a sprinter; there are nuances in a gaming mouse that can enhance a gamer's performance and speak to their persona. We have designed a custom gaming mouse incorporating the latest technology, trends and feedback of the top mouse enthusiasts and pro gaming communities. Here's a summary of the key features we have incorporated into our mouse that will enable anyone to make a custom personalized high end mouse themselves.

 
Features
Ultralight weight design


The Ultra Custom is currently the lightest RGB wireless gaming mouse available on the market at ~66 to 73 grams. Other highend wireless gaming mice on the market weigh around 80 grams. The honeycomb design is based on enthusiasts modding and 3D printing weight reduced shells. The honeycomb shell design enables an ultra light weight while maintaining a structurally strong design. 

You will also have the option to lower weight down further to 58 grams in full wired mode. But why wired mode? For enthusiasts, they want to eliminate any tracking lag from their input devices and that means typical wireless mice have about 12–18 ms of lag which can be seen and felt in game - skating, delayed or floating feeling. The Ultra Custom has a 1ms USB report rate, optimized MCU and latest R&D wireless technology making input lag virtually negligible. You will not be able to distinguish the difference between the Ultra Custom in wireless vs wired mode.
Our Ultra Flexible Type C wired Cables were developed so that even in wired mode, the Ultra Custom will feel almost wireless. Plus, custom matching cables on a mouse enhances the bespoke look and feel of a matching themed battle station. 
Ergonomic Design
Based on a proven ergonomic shape, the Ultra Custom is suitable for small to large hands. The mouse will enable gamers to play for hours without wrist aches or hand pains. With 100% PTFE skate feet, the Ultra Custom glides buttery smooth.
 
Ultra Flexible Type C Wired Cable System
Enthusiasts are usually sick of the stiff heavy cables plaguing typical gaming mice on the market. The stiff cables add to the resistance and friction between the gaming mouse wire and their mouse pad. Enthusiasts have been for years iterating different designs to have the lightest and most flexible cables in order to reduce drag and friction on their mouse movements.
We have developed an FCC compliant cable that is on par with a fully custom paracord cable. You will be able to select from a range of different colored cables for Wired Gaming mode. Modders, DIY and enthusiasts usually order these custom paracord cables for as much as $20 and then proceed to open their mouse and replace and install the cable themselves for both aesthetic and performance reasons.
With our cable system, you can have a custom ultra flexible cable with matching colors to your gaming setup with out all the hassle - simply select a cable and plug it into your mouse. USB-C is the emerging standard for charging and transferring data. The Ultra Custom is perhaps the only type-C wireless rechargeable high end gaming mouse -  you can quickly charge to full power in under 1 Hr. Get up to 66 Hours before re-charging.
 
Mouse Shell Cover & Button Customization 

Enthusiasts take great lengths to optimize and personalize their mouse by disassembling them, modding them and repainting the cover shells. You can now simply select different shell finishes and tool-lessly replace the button and top shell covers in seconds. Select from different color finished top shells with either a honeycomb design or solid cover shape.





 
DPI button Customization
Match and personalize your mouse design by selecting from different colors and button heights for the dpi button to support your grip style. Lower DPI button heights for example are better suited for palm and 1-3-1 users so that there is less accidental DPI clicks in game.

 
With your support and contribution, we can increase production and lower costs.

<p>When
we talk about changing personality, we exclude traits that define us. At an early
age, every child absorbs different skills and habits. Learning process never
ends. What we know and who we are is our only surviving tool.<span>  Everybody wonders what the true formula for
success is. By analyzing some of the most successful people we noticed patterns
which repeat at every step. Organization, consistency and persistence! Three
skills which, with training, are learnable and can become habit. The fact is,
life isn't getting easier, and that’s why we have to get stronger. Without the right
habits, it's like you're thrown into a war zone without rifle. It took us four
months to design perfect tool which can help people to gain those right habits.

<p>Including
social science students in research was crucial step which we had to take to
test Month Planner. We needed honest feedback of our product from students who
used the product at home. First we gathered 21 volunteers who filled questioner
about their first impression and what they expect. They all received free Month

analyzing questionnaires, we changed basic design and extended time period up

Where should I place my Month Planner?
It's your decision. 76% of tested students placed Month Planner on the wall
next to their working area. It's important that you place it somewhere where
you look at or pass by frequently. 
4)  Which tasks should I
pick?
Try to avoid tasks like ''Take out trash'' or ''Clean your room''.
Concentrate on your work, tasks which can result in employment, tasks that
aren't easy but possible, tasks which are essential for your big life goals. It
would be ideal if you combined your own wishes with work because that's when
your inner motivation becomes your strongest ally.
