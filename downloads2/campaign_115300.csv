<p>A girl’s gotta eat, and a guy too.  Why not <b>eat well,
thoughtfully, and with style</b> in the idiosyncratic, often funny, deeply
personal company of author and cook Hanne Blank?  Themed issues dig deep into the heart of not just what to
cook and how but also why and what it does to us and for us, and all those who
share our table, when we do.  <i>A Girl’s Gotta Eat</i> is <b>essay, recipes, technique tips, and deeply
personal reflections on food, cooking, serving, and eating.</b></p>
<p>Everyone enjoys a well-run household.  Everyone it seems -- including wives --
seems to dream of having a wife who makes it so.  <i>How To Be Your Own
Wife </i>says <b>don’t dream it, be it<i>. 
</i></b>Author Hanne Blank, queer feminist scion of a long line of top-notch
midwestern housekeepers, helps you rethink domesticity and <b>“wife skills” as good politics and good self-care</b>, a source of
pleasure, comfort, and self-sufficiency. 
<i>How To Be Your Own Wife</i> is <b>thought-provoking prose, seriously road-tested
domestic technique, and uncompromising good housekeeping</b> on a quarterly
basis, 100% free of crafts and decorating.</p>
<p>These will go out together in doubleheader quarterly editions, one half <i>A Girl's Gotta Eat</i> and one half <i>How To Be Your Own Wife</i>, served up quarterly via email in the form of PDFs you can keep forever and even print out if you are so inclined.  </p>
<p>At the end of the year, you'll receive a compilation of all 4 issues in a single PDF, complete with index and recipe listing.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Why Crowdfund This Project?</h3> <p>As an author, crowdfunding these highly idiosyncratic, very personal projects lets me do work that I'd have a hard time finding a place for in the traditional publishing industry.  YOU make it possible for me to write about things that I'm passionate about in the ways that I'm fired-up about writing.  </p>
<p>Doing it this way means I don't have to write about domestic stuff in all the predictable, traditional ways we've all seen a thousand times before.    I don't have to shill products.  I don't have to assume there's any predetermined goal or standard for amazing food and a great domestic environment.  </p>
<p>Crowdfunding this project means I get to talk about domesticity and cooking as personal responsibility, as modes of competence... as political acts and places to create pleasure.  Crowdfunding this project means I don't have to talk about hosting holiday dinners (unless I feel like it) but instead can talk about the ways consciously creating your own domestic environment can be a radical, transformational source of self-sufficiency and self-care. </p>
<p>Crowdfunding a project like this means I get to speak directly to YOU, and you can, in turn, speak directly back to me.  My experience with writing A Girl's Gotta Eat during 2013-2014 made me realize how amazing having that tight relationship with my readers could be.</p>

I was with her in the birthing room at Saint Thomas’ Hospital during her labour, perhaps the best hospital in London to have a British baby met as it is situated across from Big Ben on the river Thames and each room features large windows which overlook the sweet sights below.

A video shared by a friend on facebook caught my eye and upon playing it, caught my heart as well. It was of a father and his child, probably a few years older than my nephew Leo, at Place de la République, where a memorial for the lives lost had been set up. A journalist interviewed the child, who was around age 4 at the time, about what he understood had happened and his response made me think of my nephew and how the children of today will have to learn how to digest the growing violence.

<p>Hello! My name is Deborah Kane Goldblatt. I'm a New Zealander by birth, an American immigrant-citizen and live in Mexico.  My work as a dialogue facilitator and consultant for not for profit organizations focusing on multi-generational, youth and family programming has taken me all over the world.

<p>""Syria Welcomes A Stranger"": stories and photographs of my journey to Syria - October 2010 is written in a narrative style, giving voice to the hospitable Syrians I met with photographs of some of them in the places I saw. </p>
<p>Little did we know or ever possibly imagine what would happen beginning just months after my visit. In Syria's eighth year of terror, slaughter and genocide, 8.4 million children are affected by the war. 3.3 million children have been displaced. More than 15,000 unaccompanied and separated children have crossed Syrian borders. </p>
<p>As extremely complicated a story as Syria’s demise is, what’s true is Syria’s people, dead or alive, surviving in or out of Syria, are all too forgotten. I keep asking myself: in their suffering and devastation, how can I ever forget them? I owe my Syrian hosts and acquaintances something. When so few people outside Syria know about the country or its people other than war historians, human rights workers and journalists, how could my travel stories and photographs move someone to care and act?</p>
<p>At the very least, in gratitude for their kindness and warm hospitality, this e-book will raise funds to practically help Syrian refugees in displacement camps survive, offer some hope and, perhaps inspire a stranger to welcome them in, if only for a short time to help build life anew.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In my effort to raise funds for the production and distribution of my e-book, I am also raising funds for Help Refugees. </p>
<p>Help Refugees is a volunteer charity based in the UK doing amazing work through its 75 partner organizations with minimal overheads and maximum impact. 94% of donations go straight to the frontline delivered by Help Refugees partner organizations and volunteers. Help Refugees is my choice of charity to locate, distribute and supply the items we buy for the Syrian refugees' needs.</p>

In late November of this year, Help Refugees will open two pop shops in NYC and in December in London. I intend to shop at both shops and spend 90% of the money we raise from my e-book readings and this online fund-raising campaign. </p>

<p>Help me buy the pop-up shop several times over! A donation of $80 or more today will buy one free copy of my e-book as well a shelter bundle.

I have written a picture book for children called Hold On, Toby.            The story begins with Toby, a little maple leaf bud on a very big tree. As he grows and matures, he journeys through each season, encountering the wonder and forces of nature, and various critters and people of all sizes along the way. Throughout his journey Toby is often told to ‘hold on,’ although he has no idea what that means. Children will delight in Toby’s interaction with other characters, and will wonder, along with Toby, what is going to happen!I wrote this book because I wanted children to become aware of, experience and learn to appreciate the cycle that occurs as a natural part of life --- the renewal of life each spring, the blossoming of summer, the glory of the changing colors of fall, and the resting nature of winter.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The creation of <strong><i>Glorious Atrocities and Barbaric Nobles</i> </strong>began several years ago in Calgary. With a unifying interest in the bizarre, the macabre, and the art of storytelling, <strong>Paul Stapfer</strong> and <strong>Kyle D. Mack</strong> pondered an age-old question:</p>
<p><i>""If Earth was a petri-dish under observation from a visitor from the cosmic beyond, how would such an alien intelligence perceive Christmas?""</i></p>
<p>Thus began the compilation of a book which detailed four Christmas-themed events, as seen through the eyes of a sentient and near omnipotent life form from another universe with no concept of humanity's most festive occasion. These surreal, character rich, and classic-with-a-dark-twist stories became a labour of love and pain as much as it was a journey of the mind and the soul. Soon, they evolved into a globe-spanning narrative, which showcases the varying celebratory practices and origins of Western civilization's most profoundly revered and perversely commercialized holiday. </p>
<p>Once the manuscript was nearing completion, Paul and Kyle took the extraordinarily wise step of electing to add illustrations to their latest collection of stories. With the help of Calgary artist, <strong>Jason Mathis</strong>, a mere collection of words evolved into the essential elements of everything held dear by true connoisseurs of art, literature, and grand Christmas story telling itself.</p>
<p>Ideally, with generous contributions, <i><strong>Glorious Atrocities and Barbaric Nobles</strong></i> will soon greet its dawn and then grace the hearts, minds, and very souls of the Christmas masses.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Terra Bulla Ink is looking for $5000 to cover the initial overhead of editing, front and back cover design and illustrations, first edition printing costs, and the ultimate shipping and distribution to you, the contributors. Any finances exceeding the minimum will be applied towards expanded online sales and marketing as well as nationwide distribution and touring schedules to predetermined brick and mortar retail outlets.</p>
<p>Here is a more finite breakdown of how we plan to use the $5000 we are hoping to raise:</p>
<p><strong>Art and Design – 30%</strong></p>
<p>This will cover the costs associated with taking a manuscript with illustrations and arranging it in a manner suitable for publication. To do this, we will need to acquire a few new art-meets-technology gadgets and pay a few people to help with formatting.</p>
<p><strong>Editing – 28%</strong></p>
<p>Editors don’t generally work for free. We intend to recoup costs from our professional editor who helped us ensure that we did not produce a book about a multiverse where multiverse is spelled with a “B”.</p>
<p><strong>Printing and Digitizing – 20%</strong></p>
<p>You know those companies that print books and make them look amazing so that you actually want to buy them AND feel good about your purchase? They generally charge cash money for this type of work. Sad but true. We will need to pay them as well as those tech savvy folks who will help make our project easily available on your electronic book reading tablet device and this new thing called the inter-web or net … whatever the kids are calling it these days.</p>
<p><strong>Promotion and Distribution – 20%</strong></p>
<p>We do not expect everyone who wants to read <i><strong>Glorious Atrocities and Barbaric Nobles</strong></i>  to come to our homes and pick up their copy in person. We will almost certainly need to ship our product to many places around the world. We will also need to help many people around the world learn about <i><strong>Glorious Atrocities and Barbaric Nobles</strong></i> in the first place. Hence, promotion and distribution costs.</p>
<p><strong>Incidentals – 2%</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes we forget things. Sometimes we need things we did not think of. Sometimes things come up. Life happens. We plan to allocate two percent of our budget to the “what if” category, in case we forget things or something unexpected happens.</p>
<p>Together, those number add up to 100%</p> <p>I like what I see, I like what I hear. So how can I help?</p>
<p>The best way to help us get <strong><i>Glorious Atrocities and Barbaric Nobles</i></strong> into your hands is to donate to our project through this page. Check out the Perks to see what we plan to offer to our supporters, and follow us on Instagram/Facebook/Twitter as well, in order to get to know us better and learn more about who we are and what we do. Although it goes without saying, we really appreciate any support we receive. We also believe that a project like this is made even more amazing as a result of the fact that fans, friends, family, supporters, and well-wishers have the opportunity to be part of turning our dream into reality.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We have always believed that the world is a soul-crushing, dream-smashing, life-sucking, and downright Terra Bulla place. However, when independent creators have opportunities to share their creations with the world, it can sometimes become a little bit better. There's always a glimmer of hope out there somewhere (<a href=""http://www.facebook.com/terrabullaink"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.facebook.com/terrabullaink</a>).</p>
<p>Yes, we see the good, the bad, and the satire in everything, especially Christmas. </p>
<p>By helping us get our creation out into the world, you will also be helping the world itself. We want to make sure that this year's Christmas season is not dominated entirely by the usual concoction of trends and fads and mega-corps and all the other revolting mass-consumerism that goes hand in hand with the festive season.</p>
<p>We're sure you're on the same page. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We know we are small fish in a very big pond. We also know that when new and/or aspiring writers attempt to enter into a world dominated by very big names with very big followings, things might not go exactly as planned.</p>
<p>The risks associated with <i><strong>Glorious Atrocities and Barbaric Nobles</strong></i> are fairly minimal, but it is somewhat possible that the costs we have budgeted for will increase, distribution of the book to the greater multiverse will run into obstacles, and a meteor could strike the earth AT ANY TIME which could result in all of this hard work being completely wasted OR scattered amidst the remainders of human civilization to one day be found and then reused by some alien race for their own bizarre and/or narcissistic purposes. We sincerely hope none of those things happen, but stranger things have happened.</p>
<p>To put that another way, we may have to use some of our own personal finances, in addition to the funds we collect, to offset unforeseen costs. We might also run into trouble getting the book distributed and have to do more leg work than we planned. We might also find out that some people do not like the book as much as we do … improbable, but it could happen.</p>
<p>However, there is very little (aside from that pesky and devastating meteor) that could stop us from actually completing this project, getting the book printed, making it available, and getting it into the hands of those who really want it.</p>
<p>Terra Bulla Ink is doing this on its own, Terra Bulla Ink has been doing this on its own for years, and no one has the power to stop us from doing this except Terra Bulla Ink.</p>
<p>Our biggest challenge will be taking our self-published collection of short stories and turning it into a widely loved property that sits on bookshelves alongside the work of other well renowned writers and storytellers. Of course, that is our own challenge, and it will not get in the way of us getting <i><strong>Glorious Atrocities and Barbaric Nobles</strong></i> to our supporters and fans (especially those who help us with the funding).</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, and Terra Bulla Ink gets that, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask others to get the word out and make some noise about this campaign.</li>
<li>Remind them to use all known varieties of social media as well as word of mouth, and the Indiegogo share tools.</li>
</ul>

« Nous
entendons beaucoup parler d’ouverture de conscience et de
développement personnel. Ginette vit et porte cette connexion au
plus grand que soi dans sa vie quotidienne. Elle incarne l’amour et
les gens qui la côtoient aiment tous être pris dans ses bras et
goûter à un contact de cœur à cœur sans aucune retenue. » 
(…)
 « Dans
ce livre, vous allez découvrir son parcours personnel qu’elle
dévoile avec beaucoup d’humilité : nous comprenons peu à
peu comment elle est parvenue à son état actuel d’ouverture, de
présence, d’amour et de joie. Comment ses passions, ses rencontres
l’ont amené de l’art vers le rebirth, la méditation puis vers
la naissance et la création d’Holos. »

de la Préface d’Isabelle Challut

Ginette Forget : Je suis une artiste de la Présence,
Créatrice de la Pratique HOLOS, auteure du livre « HOLOS, La
Présence en SOI ». En 1986, j’ai fondé l’école « Souffle
de vie » où j’ai enseigné le rebirth, la méditation et le
Cours en Miracles, ce qui m’a amené à enseigner à
l’international. Mon attention se porte maintenant sur L’Art de
la PRÉSENCE et je me laisse guider là où la vie me porte. J’aime
rencontrer les gens et transmettre en direct, dans la simplicité du
moment. Ce que vous retrouvez sur ma chaîne Youtube sont des
extraits de ces rencontres que j’offre.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Hello there! I'm Heather, and I've been writing and talking about history since 1991 when I started a summer job at a Revolutionary War museum when I was in high school. In 1998 I built my first history website, on Colonial America. And in 2009 I started the Renaissance English History Podcast, which makes it one of the longest continuously running indie history podcasts. </p>
<p>In 2016 I created the 2017 Tudor Planner, a weekly/monthly planner that brings together history with planning - something that I definitely need as a mom with a young kiddo, who is also an entrepreneur (me, not the kiddo, though I'm sure she'll be an entrepreneur when she's older!). I've always loved planners, since I bought my first Ziggy assignment book - I color coded my assignments with Crayola skinny markers (the Bold colors - do they still make those?).</p>
<p>So creating a Tudor Planner was really a mixture of the two things I love - Tudor history, and planners. The first one was way more successful than I ever imagined, and last year, for the 2018 one, I worked with a printer. I'm working with the same printer this year, but making even more improvements, which is driving the cost up. </p>
<p>Some of the changes I'm making this year are stickers (!!!), and tabs in between each week - both of those were major requests. I'm also adding in more holidays and Tudor historical days. It's going to be awesome!<br/><br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The initial print run is going to cost about $10,000. I'm crowdfunding for most of that so that I can offset my up front costs. I'm using the same printer as last year, so I know the quality will be just as good as before. </p>
<p>What you get by supporting the planner are:<br/>1) You get to be involved from the very early stages - I'll keep you updated as things happen like we get proofs, and the print run happens. <br/>2) You get the planner at a way discounted price - it won't be this inexpensive again this year.<br/>3) Awesome perks! <br/><br/>All the money I raise will go towards these printing costs. Even if I don't make the full amount, I'll use everything I get towards paying the printer. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I'm a huge believer in building empathy and peace through history. As we learn more about the motivations of people from the past, and start to really understand them, it builds our empathy muscle, and helps us understand people who are different than we are today. I also see the connections between Tudor England and today - it's a time very similar to our own. New technologies made disseminating information easier than ever before, with less control than ever before. Wars of religion mixed with exploration made the world seem more in touch than ever, yet also led to people being nervous about their own culture, and fearful of the unknown. There are so many parallels. These are the stories I tell in my podcast.</p>
<p>The planner is a major source of income for me, and helps to keep my show running, and independent. It helps to keep me doing these shows every week or two, and keep bringing these stories alive. It also allows me to create events that bring together Tudor enthusiasts from around the world, like the Tudor Summit, a virtual online event that happens every six months, and features leading historians, bloggers, and podcasters in the Tudor World. All of this takes time, and energy, and the Planner is a major way that my work is supported. </p>

Hello there! I'm Heather, and I've been writing and talking about history since 1991 when I started a summer job at a Revolutionary War museum when I was in high school. In 1998 I built my first history website, on Colonial America. And in 2009 I started the Renaissance English History Podcast, which makes it one of the longest continuously running indie history podcasts. 
In 2016 I created the 2017 Tudor Planner, a weekly/monthly planner that brings together history with planning - something that I definitely need as a mom with a young kiddo, who is also an entrepreneur (me, not the kiddo, though I'm sure she'll be an entrepreneur when she's older!). I've always loved planners, since I bought my first Ziggy assignment book - I color coded my assignments with Crayola skinny markers (the Bold colors - do they still make those?).
So creating a Tudor Planner was really a mixture of the two things I love - Tudor history, and planners. The first one was way more successful than I ever imagined, and last year, for the 2018 one, I worked with a printer. I'm working with the same printer this year, but making even more improvements, which is driving the cost up. 
Some of the changes I'm making this year are stickers (!!!), and tabs in between each week - both of those were major requests. I'm also adding in more holidays and Tudor historical days. It's going to be awesome! 

What We Need & What You Get
The initial print run is going to cost about $10,000. I'm crowdfunding for most of that so that I can offset my up front costs. I'm using the same printer as last year, so I know the quality will be just as good as before. 
What you get by supporting the planner are:1) You get to be involved from the very early stages - I'll keep you updated as things happen like we get proofs, and the print run happens. 2) You get the planner at a way discounted price - it won't be this inexpensive again this year.3) Awesome perks! All the money I raise will go towards these printing costs. Even if I don't make the full amount, I'll use everything I get towards paying the printer.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p><i>In Love With A Lie</i> is about a boy who meets a girl, falls in love, and starts to discover who he is during the midst of the worst time in his life.<br/><br/>My name is Stanley Ihejirika and I am the author of In Love With A Lie. I wrote this book because I wanted people to see what falling in love can be like when your world is crashing down.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how chaotic life situations can impact who you are and how you love. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for love/romance stories within you. And ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you understand why the person you fell in love with may change after a chaotic situation.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about love and chaos:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brothers but not by blood - Dame and Trey first meet in one of the most random ways. They are different in every way, but it’s these differences that have shaped them to become who they are. Dame can be lost in his head more than in the world. Trey is able to make him live in the world and not his head.</li>
<li>Death of a loved one - Dame loses his dad—the man he idolizes most, and his last conversation with him was the worst ever.</li>
<li>Personality - Dame is quiet and doesn’t interact with women too much. But for this girl he lays it all on the line. Not every guy can be outgoing, charming, or flirtatious. A lot of us are quiet and reserved. Our worst fear is talking to girls that we think are above us or we are unworthy of. Dame fights that fear while being pulled by two girls he feels he doesn’t deserve.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you love humor, real life situations, Chicago, and romance. In Love With A Lie is a fiction book that speaks to people who’ve been manipulated and heart broken, and who are looking at their pain and the way they evolved from it for the first time.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h2>The Book - In Love With A Lie</h2>
<p>The book is written in 3 Parts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Part 1 contains the Introduction + Chapters 1-3. You are introduced to Dame, his family network, friends and his internal struggle.</li>
<li>Part 2 contains Chapters 4-7. You will learn about Dame’s first love and the interactions that start to mold him in different ways. In one part, Dame is going on a college tour that he’s excited about. He heard his first love say she liked a man with a button up shirt, so that’s what he decides to wear when he sees her next.</li>
<li>Part 3 contains Chapters 8-10. You will see the breaking and the building up of Dame. For once, he has to decide who he is and not what the world is trying to define him to be. In one situation, Dame gets into an emotional, heated argument with his counselor who sees through the anger to the immense pain.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

<h2>About the Author</h2>
<p>Stanley Ihejirika is an alumni of Michigan State University where he earned a bachelors in Political Science. He is a fanatic of poetry and beautiful romance stories and movies.

<h3><strong>About the Author</strong></h3>
<p>Luke Schumacher is a journalist in the Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas area and recent graduate from the University of Oklahoma.<br/><br/>While he was in college, Luke noticed how many other young adults who called themselves Christians were more eager to enjoy their newfound freedoms than to follow Christ.

However, it is not intended to be treated as a rule book of what to do and not to do.<br/><br/>When he is not working on the book, Luke loves writing fiction, poetry and anything creative that pops into his head. If you see him writing with earbuds in, he is probably listening to Christian metal music.

<h3>Que?</h3>
<p><strong>Hai que roelo</strong> reflicte unha época mediante os acontecementos que xiran ao redor dun modesto equipo de fútbol.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Ao berro de «Hai que roelo!» a afección galega ateigaba as gradas do Estadio de Pasarón. Alí, un equipo formado por xogadores descoñecidos para o gran público, facía as ledicias dos afeccionados galegos ao deporte do balón. Paralelamente aos éxitos deportivos do equipo granate, Galicia esperta paseniñamente da súa ancestral e eterna noite. Tres amigos reúnense nas tabernas da cidade do Lérez para comentar o devir cotián daqueles anos, así coma os éxitos dos Cobo, Irulegui, Batalla, Cholo e compañía. Aínda que coinciden na análise social da época, teñen distintos pareceres en como afrontalos derradeiros anos do franquismo, que van de o roturismo radical que representa o avogado Pedro Fontales ata a inacción do seu amigo, o xornalista chairego Amador Sanfiz, que é un home da Galicia interior, dese territorio costumista que carece dun mínimo de auto estima, malia que sabe que así non se vai a ningures. No medio deles irrompe Moncho Botes, un retranqueiro por excelencia que prefire unha terceira vía.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Na súa novela,<strong> Antonio Cendán</strong> lévanos a esa Galicia dos sesenta, na que a do interior e o litoral se ignoran mutuamente a extremos que raian co paroxismo.</p>
<h3>Quen?</h3>
<p><strong>Do Peirao</strong> é unha editorial con vontade de cambio, de dar a alternativa a autores que non a atopan noutro lugar, con novas e refrescantes ideas como é o empregar unha campaña preventa para valorar a aceptación e viabilidade de cada título.</p>
<p>Deste xeito es ti, agora que te estás expondo como colaborar, o que decide se a obra que che presentamos verá a luz pasando a formar parte do noso catálogo... porque consideramos ao lector parte fundamental do proceso.</p>
<p>Hoxe presentámosche a <strong>Antonio Cendán</strong>.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Nado na parroquia chairega de Sancobade, no concello de Vilalba, licenciouse en Xornalismo pola Universidade Complutense de Madrid en 1989. Sete anos máis tarde, en 1996, obtería o doutorado polo mesmo centro académico despois de defender unha tese de doutoramento baixo o título <i>El Sistema Informativo en Galicia durante el franquismo</i>, coa que obtivo a máxima cualificación académica.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">O xornalista chairego desenvolveu o seu labor profesional en distintos medios de comunicación entre eles a Axencia EFE, Televisión de Galicia e os xornais <i>El Mundo</i> e <i>La Voz de Galicia</i>. Así mesmo foi columnista do xornal compostelán <i>El Correo Gallego</i> e colaborador asiduo de diversos medios dixitais.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Aínda que esta é a súa primeira novela, Antonio Cendán publicou varios ensaios sobre o xornalismo galego, converténdose no maior experto na historia dos medios de comunicación galegos. Entre as súas obras destacan <i>Xornalismo e Medios de Comunicación en Galicia durante o Franquismo</i>, <i>A Televisión en Galicia</i> e <i>A Prensa en Galicia a partir de 1976</i>.</p>
<h3>Por que?</h3>
<p>Por aquí un fragmento do texto como mostra:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">«O domingo vindeiro comeza a liga en tódalas categorías nacionais. Amador Sanfiz, o xornalista chairego, ten que seguir ao Pontevedra. Unha entrevista súa causa sensación mundial, xa que se fai eco ela o xornal soviético <i>Pravda</i>. Vén de entrevistar ao defensa Cholo, do que salienta a súa categoría profesional sen deixar tampouco de lado que é condutor de trolebús. O xornal ruso ensalza ao equipo galego, dicindo que é o dos traballadores, nun pais no que o fútbol está superprofesionalizado. Os xornais deportivos loan unha Galicia que agora nace nas Rías Baixas. Os dous amigos de Amador Sanfiz, Moncho Botes e Pedro Fontales, seguen con paixón ao equipo granate que se enfronta ao Athletic Bilbaíno, tal e como dirían os xornais de hai trinta anos».</p>
<h3>Como?</h3>
<p>Para arrincar o proxecto fixámonos como obxectivo 880€; esta é a cantidade que recadariamos se ao redor de cincuenta mecenas se fixesen, cada cal, cun exemplar desta primeira edición.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tendo acceso ás galeradas de edición.</li>
<li>Recibindo un exemplar semanas antes da saída ao mercado da obra.</li>
<li>Aínda que, tamén poderías ver o teu nome nos agradecementos achegando un pouco máis.</li>
</ul>
<p>Os fondos recadados utilizaranse como axuda para sacar adiante esta primeira edición de <i>Hai que roelo</i>, que sairía despois á venda.</p>
<h3><strong>Ademais...</strong></h3>
<p>Sabemos que son tempos difíciles, tamén nós os sufrimos, e é posible que non esteas en disposición de apoiarnos co teu mecenado nestes momentos... pero agardamos que se isto te chegou á alma, mesmo se talvez coñeces en persoa ao autor, trates de difundir esta campaña (facebook, twitter, blogger, boca-orella... ) para que academos a nosa meta e <strong>Antonio Cendán </strong>vexa publicada a súa obra.</p>
<p>Grazas polo voso tempo.</p>

Aínda que coinciden na análise social da época, teñen distintos pareceres en como afrontalos derradeiros anos do franquismo, que van de o roturismo radical que representa o avogado Pedro Fontales ata a inacción do seu amigo, o xornalista chairego Amador Sanfiz, que é un home da Galicia interior, dese territorio costumista que carece dun mínimo de auto estima, malia que sabe que así non se vai a ningures. No medio deles irrompe Moncho Botes, un retranqueiro por excelencia que prefire unha terceira vía.
Na súa novela, Antonio Cendán lévanos a esa Galicia dos sesenta, na que a do interior e o litoral se ignoran mutuamente a extremos que raian co paroxismo.
Quen?
Do Peirao é unha editorial con vontade de cambio, de dar a alternativa a autores que non a atopan noutro lugar, con novas e refrescantes ideas como é o empregar unha campaña preventa para valorar a aceptación e viabilidade de cada título.
Deste xeito es ti, agora que te estás expondo como colaborar, o que decide se a obra que che presentamos verá a luz pasando a formar parte do noso catálogo... porque consideramos ao lector parte fundamental do proceso.
Hoxe presentámosche a Antonio Cendán.
Nado na parroquia chairega de Sancobade, no concello de Vilalba, licenciouse en Xornalismo pola Universidade Complutense de Madrid en 1989. Sete anos máis tarde, en 1996, obtería o doutorado polo mesmo centro académico despois de defender unha tese de doutoramento baixo o título El Sistema Informativo en Galicia durante el franquismo, coa que obtivo a máxima cualificación académica.
O xornalista chairego desenvolveu o seu labor profesional en distintos medios de comunicación entre eles a Axencia EFE, Televisión de Galicia e os xornais El Mundo e La Voz de Galicia. Así mesmo foi columnista do xornal compostelán El Correo Gallego e colaborador asiduo de diversos medios dixitais.
Aínda que esta é a súa primeira novela, Antonio Cendán publicou varios ensaios sobre o xornalismo galego, converténdose no maior experto na historia dos medios de comunicación galegos. Entre as súas obras destacan Xornalismo e Medios de Comunicación en Galicia durante o Franquismo, A Televisión en Galicia e A Prensa en Galicia a partir de 1976.
Por que?
Por aquí un fragmento do texto como mostra:
«O domingo vindeiro comeza a liga en tódalas categorías nacionais. Amador Sanfiz, o xornalista chairego, ten que seguir ao Pontevedra. Unha entrevista súa causa sensación mundial, xa que se fai eco ela o xornal soviético Pravda. Vén de entrevistar ao defensa Cholo, do que salienta a súa categoría profesional sen deixar tampouco de lado que é condutor de trolebús. O xornal ruso ensalza ao equipo galego, dicindo que é o dos traballadores, nun pais no que o fútbol está superprofesionalizado. Os xornais deportivos loan unha Galicia que agora nace nas Rías Baixas. Os dous amigos de Amador Sanfiz, Moncho Botes e Pedro Fontales, seguen con paixón ao equipo granate que se enfronta ao Athletic Bilbaíno, tal e como dirían os xornais de hai trinta anos».
Como?
Para arrincar o proxecto fixámonos como obxectivo 880€; esta é a cantidade que recadariamos se ao redor de cincuenta mecenas se fixesen, cada cal, cun exemplar desta primeira edición.

Tendo acceso ás galeradas de edición.
Recibindo un exemplar semanas antes da saída ao mercado da obra.
Aínda que, tamén poderías ver o teu nome nos agradecementos achegando un pouco máis.

Os fondos recadados utilizaranse como axuda para sacar adiante esta primeira edición de Hai que roelo, que sairía despois á venda.
Ademais...
Sabemos que son tempos difíciles, tamén nós os sufrimos, e é posible que non esteas en disposición de apoiarnos co teu mecenado nestes momentos... pero agardamos que se isto te chegou á alma, mesmo se talvez coñeces en persoa ao autor, trates de difundir esta campaña (facebook, twitter, blogger, boca-orella... ) para que academos a nosa meta e Antonio Cendán vexa publicada a súa obra.
Grazas polo voso tempo.",0.0,0,"228 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is A.C. Burton and I am the author of Find Me in the Trenches. I wrote this book to reflect on my own testimony, as I struggled with family trauma at the end of my childhood which led to an identity crisis during my adulthood. This experience has led me through several years of seasonal defective disorder and I was ultimately diagnosed with mild depression in 2018.<br/><br/>My hope is, in reading this book, readers can discover what it takes to ultimately begin the process of healing - in family, relationships, and in self-identity. In this book, I hope to instill in readers the same sort of passion and excitement I have for the journey of healing and renewal of human spirit. Ultimately, I want readers to use this book as a testimony to share how overcoming adversity can be the ultimate strength to be resilient towards life’s challenges.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>
<p>The editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in April, 2021.</p>
<p>The cover design of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)</p>
<p>The layout design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).</p>
<p>The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</p>
<p>The launch &amp; promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this Spring.</p>
<p>When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition and an audiobook.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:</p>
<p>You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish.</p>
<p>Your name will appear in the Acknowledgments section of my book.</p>

<p>You will have the opportunity to be involved in selecting my cover and title.</p>
<p>You will be invited to join my Author Community and get behind-the-scenes sneak peeks into the publishing process.</p>
<p>And much more!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by including the cost of mailing and shipping the signed copies into each pre-order tier. <br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we ship the pre-order rewards to you as early as possible. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as to when my book will publish.

<h3>What is Mighty Myths?</h3>
<p><strong>MIGHTY MYTHS</strong> is a book series for 7 to 12 year olds about ancient myths. It’s a funny, easy to read, comical retelling of the classic stories loaded with humour, drawings, quizzes and adventure. It’s sort of like <strong><i>Andy Griffiths</i> meets <i>Horrible Histories! </i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>Check out the free sample of MIGHTY MYTHS: Greek Heroes- click the picture below!</i></strong></p>

<h3>Getting Kids Reading</h3>

<p><strong>MIGHTY MYTHS</strong> is educational but really it’s all about the laughs. We agree, the best way to get kids reading is to get them laughing.</p>

<h3>Giving Back</h3>
<p>As well as getting kids reading, we also really want to <strong>help kids</strong> <strong>in </strong><strong>marginalised</strong> communities improve their reading and writing.

<h3>The Story so far...</h3>
<p>Mick and I stumbled across MIGHTY MYTHS, Eighteen months ago. We were completely hooked. It was so much fun we just had to do it.</p>
<p>Our book sample nabbed us an agent who almost snagged us a publishing deal but after a year of drawn out negotiations, it collapsed.</p>
<p>Still <strong>totally passionate</strong> about Mighty Myths we decided to bypass the publishers, and ask our audience, 7 to 12 year olds,  what they thought of MIGHTY MYTHS?</p>
<p>We started with my son, Joey’s, year 6 class and have now surveyed 152 children and discovered that 90% of them (yes we have the stats) <strong>LOVE MIGHTY MYTHS!</strong></p>
<p>Writing, illustrating and producing a 120 page kids book is a <strong>HUGE </strong>job, but with your support we can get <strong>MIGHTY MYTHS: Greek Heroes</strong> made and into kids hands where it belongs!</p>

<h3>Truth. </h3>
<p>We seek the truth, we deserve the truth, in anything. In this book it is my goal to answer the many unanswered questions about one of the most bizarre terrorist attacks of the past decade. My research left no stone unturned and the results are astonishing. </p>
<h3>Funds. </h3>
<p>In order to get the technical side covered: cover design, editing and printing, we need $5,000. It would be great to have this money before mid-summer so that the book, fresh from the printing machine, will be made available in time for the anniversary of the Moscow theatre siege. And, of course, all of you, will get a signed copy.  </p>

<h3>The Impact.</h3>
<p>Your contribution will make an enormous difference, including to those who lost their loved ones in the siege, and who feel that 'the truth will never come out'.</p>
<p>With your help the first proper non-biased account of the events will see the light of day. </p>

<p><b>I set the preorder funding at $2500, a number to help me raise money TOWARD printing.  In simple math terms, 250 books x 17.00 (the avg. cost I estimated receiving from preorders) = $4250.00.  I didn't think I could raise $4250.00 so I estimated something I felt I could achieve.  As of now, (including proofs) I've sold 161 books.  That means, I still have about 90 more to go!  <br/></b></p>

told over the years, write faster, you're taking too long. From an artistic

<p> Kyan Rawlings’ life has been forever changed by an incident he wishes he could erase from his memory, but never will. After this unspeakable tragedy, he is left with Post Traumatic Stress and a state of irascibility. However, little does he know, that the most significant change in his somewhat mundane life is yet to come. Dealing with the perfunctory day-to-day is nothing compared to finding out what he truly is. He discovers that he is an Adept, a powerful animal kindred spirit. Unwittingly, Kyan will not only become immersed in a world that he does not understand, but also protecting a woman he only recently met, Drea, from an unseen force. She is one of four remaining Dragons, a dying breed, and the Prince of the clan wants her for the sole purpose of reviving their kind. In order to protect her, Kyan will need the help Berik Woodson, who will give him the guidance he needs to fully accept his place in the animal kingdom and how to control the rage within.</p>
<p>I have already completed the first book in the trilogy.  I will be starting graduate school in the fall to begin workshopping it.  My goal is to have it published by that time.  I am taking a road trip to Seattle and then to Vancouver in the next couple weeks.  This is an integral part of the beginning of the second novel.  The characters take this journey as the story unfolds. </p>
<p>As I writer, I generally try and write from my own experience or at least try to relate to what the characters are going through.  I believe this makes the situation seem as real as possible, even in fiction/fantasy.  I felt committed and obligated to take the journey the characters will take myself as part of my writing process.  </p>
<p>As a result of this trip, I can begin to write the second book.  I have been unable to really delve into it, because this road trip is kind of a huge prerequisite.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>About me:</strong></p>
<p>I feel that nothing is more fitting for a bio than what I sent for school:</p>
<p>Growing up, I hated school. I seriously loathed getting up in the morning, rising out of bed and leaving the house. My grades were poor as a result, not stemming from a lack of intelligence, but because I was totally bored. I excelled when truly challenged or genuinely interested in the subject matter. Otherwise, I simply didn’t care. It seems ironic now that I teach English and have finished my first novel. <br/>In my youth, my thoughts and repose resided in a pretend play world. I spent hours in the backyard fighting as a knight or a ninja. I would usually be found watching movies in my bedroom or playing with my G.I. Joes. Regardless of the activity, I was always reenacting movies or creating intricate story lines about how to save the world. This abhorrence of school continued until high school. My love for acting and theatre outweighed my aversion for school. I needed to maintain a solid G.P.A. to participate in extracurricular activities, so I conceded to becoming a better student. <br/>When my great uncle, a long time advocate for education, passed away I was devastated. I was very close with him and at his wake I learned more about all of his accolades. I felt the need for an altruistic life path like he led. I participated in children’s theatre and fell completely in love with performing literature in education. I eventually graduated with an English education degree, Suma Cum Laude. <br/>I thought that I could save the world one student at a time by trying to make the classroom an engaging place full of passion for literature, just like Mr. Keating from Dead Poets Society. I wanted to be what the documentary Waiting for Superman was asking for, the hero or the “answer”. To my utter chagrin, it seemed to be a more difficult endeavor in the classrooms of today. Technology, in my experience, has the danger to render children lazy, lethargic and apathetic. Education was like a battlefield and I had to refocus my efforts to achieve victories. I would not be defeated. <br/>Then, a dreadful incident occurred in 2010. I was on a field trip and a student drowned. I watched him die after over a half an hour of searching for him in the water. The paramedics failed to revive him. The event was a complete accident, but nonetheless devastating. I maintained relationships with the damaged and frail student population. It was very rough and a fight everyday. But Winston Churchill declared, ""If you're going through hell, keep going,” and that became my life mantra. <br/>Toward the middle of the next school year, in 2011, my students worked on an imaginary stories unit. My student teacher developed the idea that we should work on a draft of our own writing with the students. I began thinking about what to write and the contemplation became obsession. The short story became a novel, much more elaborate and adult than originally intended. <br/>With sleep deprivation and Post Traumatic Stress, I drove myself to the brink of insanity developing the intricacies of my story. The catastrophic death and the maelstrom of experiences in my educational life culminated into a cathartic finished draft of a novel. This tragic experience sparked a liberation of feelings reinvigorating me to write as a way of dealing with hardships in life just like I did in adolescence. <br/>My only course of action is to pursue my love of literature and creative writing. I yearn to engage with fellow storytellers. My goal is to collaborate with other writers and take any constructive criticisms to grow as a novelist. I need to be in a creative writing graduate school. My existence in a growing erudite community is essential. <br/>I have always been a writer really. The stories just resided inside my brain. My goal is to take all of the ideas, which are fully developed in my head and create living breathing stories for people to sink their own teeth into. I have always lived in a world of fiction. Now, I want to be the creator of the fictional worlds that help people to escape from their own lives as I did mine.</p>
<p><strong>Risks and challenges:</strong></p>
<p>I have dedicated the last three years of my life to this story and the need to tell it. This story is truly a piece of my soul. I have spent countless hours of my repose crafting it and driving myself a bit crazy.</p>
<p>I applied to graduate school for the fall of 2012 and the fall of 2013. This is not only an arduous process, both mentally and emotionally taking, but also has proven to be very expensive.</p>
<p>Thus far, I have not wanted or needed financial support to pursue my love. I find that with the looming school year and the significant amount I spent to move etc, etc, I am not as comfortable financially as I would like to be to take this trip. I was hoping to have a partner in crime to save on funds and also so that I won't drive the 30 hours alone, but I may rock it solo.</p>

American countries in 7 months and to interview 100 entrepreneurs and write
about them in our book and blog! </i>Funding our goal will allows us to pay for the
traveling costs associated with our entrepreneurial journey. In return, we’ll

<br/>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Why?</h3> <p></p>
<p>Entrepreneurship has a magical ring
to it – it speaks of innovation, progress, prosperity and risk. And for that
reason, it is perhaps the greatest change agent our society knows. While
entrepreneurship might be synonymous with the good old U.S. of A, it’s
flourishing abroad – especially in South America and could seriously change the
way we see what it means to be an entrepreneur. </p>
<p>For example, 2012 was named “The
year of entrepreneurship in Chile, and 2013, “the year of innovation”. The Global
Entrepreneurship monitor named Bolivia as having one of the highest
entrepreneurship potential in the world in 2008 and Colombia was recently named
by Fortune Magazine as being one of the top emerging countries to watch
for.  </p>
<p>In the book <i>Reverse Innovation</i>; Dartmouth professor, Vijay Govindarajan
explores the concept of innovating in the developing world and bringing it to
developed countries. The result? Creative innovations that aren’t hemmed in by
traditional “Developed world” thought, and super cost effective products and
services. </p>
<p>What if we brought <i>developing world entrepreneurship</i> to the
U.S.? Could it change the way we do business? Or the way we see what it means
to be an entrepreneur? By gathering the stories of South American
entrepreneurs, we deem to do just that: discover what it means to be an
entrepreneur in the developing world and translate that to America. It’s
reverse innovation… for entrepreneurs.</p>

some other places in between. </p>

<p>Uruguay was ranked number 5 out of 29 in the South and Central America/Caribbean region for economic freedom. Within South America, Uruguay ranks second behind Chile.</p>

<br/>
<p>There are a lot of reasons why Chile's
entrepreneurship community is growing. According to the Perceived Corruption Index,
Chile is number 1 in terms of transparency in Latin America. Chile was also
named the most competitive economy in Latin America according to the World
Economic Forum and was first in Latin America for economic freedom according to
the Economic Freedom Index in 2010. </p>

<p>Despite being one of the poorest Latin American
countries, The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor showed Bolivia as having one of

<p>Growing up, my parents encouraged my siblings and I
to discover our <i>freak flag</i> – that thing that makes you stand
out, the thing makes you freaky. For me, there are three key things that make
up my <i>freak flag.</i> </p>
<p>1.<span> 
</span>The first thing is <b>traveling</b>. I had the opportunity to study
and volunteer abroad during my high school and college career. In 2011, I
volunteered for Quito-based Fundacion Pachama, a nonprofit organization founded
by Lynne Twist aimed at protecting the rainforest and the rights of the indigenous
populations located there. </p>
<p>2.<span> 
</span>The second thing is <b>stories</b>. I’m a total bookworm and spend
more time in a book than anywhere else. That passion for stories led me to
intern for Entrepreneurs’ Organization in 2015 where I had the opportunity to
interview Philadelphia EO Members about their experiences and businesses. </p>
<p>3.<span> 
</span>The last and third thing is <b>entrepreneurship</b>. While I’m just
a wanna-be entrepreneur, I grew up with an entrepreneur for a father and spent
time watching him build businesses. Entrepreneurship is a huge part of what
makes me tick. In 2012, I interned with Verne Harnish and helped in his Fortune
Magazine’s Leadership and Growth Summits where I was surrounded by rock star
speakers and entrepreneurs. I also worked with my Dad’s (Barrett Ersek) company
Holganix, managing their inbound marketing including their website, social
media, blogging and content creation. </p>
<p>I truly believe that these three things that make
up my <i>freak flag </i>have culminated into our <b>BHAG</b>: to
travel to 7 South American countries in 7 months and interview 100
entrepreneurs, learn their stories and write about them in our blog. For more
information on me, check out my <span><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pub/kaitlyn-ersek/54/217/a76"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">LinkedIn profile here</a></span>.</p>

<p>As a recent college graduate at Temple University,
I had the opportunity to spend time working for several start up companies,
soaking in everything they told me. Working with start-ups pushed me to wear
many hats and get creative in order to best help build their companies. In
2011, I had the opportunity to work in the marketing department of start up
snack manufacturer: Pretzel Pete. In 2012, I helped a start up Yoga Studio
design their studio and launch their marketing strategy. Later that year, I had
my first taste of big business in a sales function at Kellogg’s and in 2015, I
joined forces with a friend to help build his start up fire alarm company. </p>
<p>People see me as a thrill seeker; whether it's
skydiving or action sports like skateboarding, skimboarding or
bodybuilding, I'm always looking for the next big adventure. In
addition to my passion for excitement, I love art, being physically
active and helping others. Because of my love for helping others, while in
South America I plan on volunteering with start-ups and non profits. </p>
<p>Throughout the adventure, I’ll be video taping
several of the interviews and designing the overall book layout and plan.</p>

countries. There's a good chance we may take a couple detours or visit
some other places in between. 
1. ARGENTINA



Because of the connections we've already formed and
the amazing entrepreneurial community, we plan on starting in Buenos
Aires. 

2. URUGUAY



Uruguay was ranked number 5 out of 29 in the South and Central America/Caribbean region for economic freedom. Within South America, Uruguay ranks second behind Chile.
3. CHILE 


There are a lot of reasons why Chile's
entrepreneurship community is growing. According to the Perceived Corruption Index,
Chile is number 1 in terms of transparency in Latin America. Chile was also
named the most competitive economy in Latin America according to the World
Economic Forum and was first in Latin America for economic freedom according to
the Economic Freedom Index in 2010. 
4. BOLIVIA


Despite being one of the poorest Latin American
countries, The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor showed Bolivia as having one of
the highest entrepreneurship potential in the world in 2008. 

5. PERU



According to a 2015 Gem Study, there are more
people in Peru intending to pursue entrepreneurship than in other Latin
American country.
6. ECUADOR 


This entire adventure began with an internship in
Quito, Ecuador. That experience sparked our goal to interview 100 South
American entrepreneurs.
7.
COLOMBIA



Colombia has an amazing entrepreneurial community
and was recently named by Fortune Magazine as one of the top emerging countries
to be on the watch for. 
*Due to complications, we have replaced Brazil with Uruguay on our adventure.
   Our Story

Kaitlyn
Ersek – Writer and wanna-be-entrepreneur


Growing up, my parents encouraged my siblings and I
to discover our freak flag – that thing that makes you stand
out, the thing makes you freaky. For me, there are three key things that make
up my freak flag. 
1. 
The first thing is traveling. I had the opportunity to study
and volunteer abroad during my high school and college career. In 2011, I
volunteered for Quito-based Fundacion Pachama, a nonprofit organization founded
by Lynne Twist aimed at protecting the rainforest and the rights of the indigenous
populations located there. 
2. 
The second thing is stories. I’m a total bookworm and spend
more time in a book than anywhere else. That passion for stories led me to
intern for Entrepreneurs’ Organization in 2015 where I had the opportunity to
interview Philadelphia EO Members about their experiences and businesses. 
3. 
The last and third thing is entrepreneurship. While I’m just
a wanna-be entrepreneur, I grew up with an entrepreneur for a father and spent
time watching him build businesses. Entrepreneurship is a huge part of what
makes me tick. In 2012, I interned with Verne Harnish and helped in his Fortune
Magazine’s Leadership and Growth Summits where I was surrounded by rock star
speakers and entrepreneurs. I also worked with my Dad’s (Barrett Ersek) company
Holganix, managing their inbound marketing including their website, social
media, blogging and content creation. 
I truly believe that these three things that make
up my freak flag have culminated into our BHAG: to
travel to 7 South American countries in 7 months and interview 100
entrepreneurs, learn their stories and write about them in our blog. For more
information on me, check out my LinkedIn profile here.

Andrew Bagwell – Videographer,
artist and innovator 


As a recent college graduate at Temple University,
I had the opportunity to spend time working for several start up companies,
soaking in everything they told me. Working with start-ups pushed me to wear
many hats and get creative in order to best help build their companies. In
2011, I had the opportunity to work in the marketing department of start up
snack manufacturer: Pretzel Pete. In 2012, I helped a start up Yoga Studio
design their studio and launch their marketing strategy. Later that year, I had
my first taste of big business in a sales function at Kellogg’s and in 2015, I
joined forces with a friend to help build his start up fire alarm company. 
People see me as a thrill seeker; whether it's
skydiving or action sports like skateboarding, skimboarding or
bodybuilding, I'm always looking for the next big adventure. In
addition to my passion for excitement, I love art, being physically
active and helping others. Because of my love for helping others, while in
South America I plan on volunteering with start-ups and non profits. 
Throughout the adventure, I’ll be video taping
several of the interviews and designing the overall book layout and plan.
For more information on me, check out my LinkedIn profile here and my art website here.

<br/><h3>Risk &amp; Consequence: Who we are and what we do.<br/>
</h3>
<p>Hello potential funders!<br/>I'm Kaylea and I'm looking to relaunch 'Risk &amp; Consequence', an independent, free, nationally distributed 'zine filled with words, illustration and love thanks to the collaboration of some very passionate people. <br/><br/>We've already printed four issues over the last two years, which you can see <a href=""http://www.issuu.com/riskandconsequence"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">here</a>, all paid for out of our own pockets. We're due to re-launch with the goal of printing quarterly, on the 2nd October, and for now, we're paying for the printing ourselves, and have done for the last four issues, which is why we've been so sporadic with release schedules! <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>All we need is to get this copy back out into circulation so that we can seek funding through advertisement, and then print quarterly as we've always dreamed.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Printing a 'zine for people who love.<br/>
</h3>Regardless of whether or not we reach our funding goal on here, we'll be printing the first issue on the 2nd October, so we'll be out of pocket for a while but at least the 'zine will be out there, being picked up and read by the people who are really interested in what we do and want to support us. <br/><br/>We've had an amazing response to each of the last four issues printed, with most of the focus and praise being on the shape of the thing! (It's chequebook sized, so easy to carry I guess, ha)!<br/><br/>ANY funding from you guys will be appreciated, as it'll make it a little more bearable to live on beans on toast for the foreseeable future, just so that I and the 'zine's contributors can see it in print.<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Sadly, printing costs money, sigh.<br/>
</h3>
<p>All of the money received from this campaign will help us with the printing costs, which for the amount we want to print will cost £390 (I think I've worked out the USD equivalent correctly....). <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Hopefully the interest generated from this issue will allow us to seek some advertising, which will make future issues a less daunting prospect funding-wise.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We've also managed to claim a launch party at the Old Blue Last in London, where we'll be putting on Heart-ships, Us Baby Bear Bones and Hot Feet for free entry, to try and raise awareness of the 'zine and where our interests lie; in the heart of the reader and our shared love of music, fun and creativity.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>

Risk & Consequence: Who we are and what we do.

Hello potential funders!I'm Kaylea and I'm looking to relaunch 'Risk & Consequence', an independent, free, nationally distributed 'zine filled with words, illustration and love thanks to the collaboration of some very passionate people. We've already printed four issues over the last two years, which you can see here, all paid for out of our own pockets. We're due to re-launch with the goal of printing quarterly, on the 2nd October, and for now, we're paying for the printing ourselves, and have done for the last four issues, which is why we've been so sporadic with release schedules! 

All we need is to get this copy back out into circulation so that we can seek funding through advertisement, and then print quarterly as we've always dreamed.


Printing a 'zine for people who love.
Regardless of whether or not we reach our funding goal on here, we'll be printing the first issue on the 2nd October, so we'll be out of pocket for a while but at least the 'zine will be out there, being picked up and read by the people who are really interested in what we do and want to support us. We've had an amazing response to each of the last four issues printed, with most of the focus and praise being on the shape of the thing! (It's chequebook sized, so easy to carry I guess, ha)!ANY funding from you guys will be appreciated, as it'll make it a little more bearable to live on beans on toast for the foreseeable future, just so that I and the 'zine's contributors can see it in print.

Sadly, printing costs money, sigh.

All of the money received from this campaign will help us with the printing costs, which for the amount we want to print will cost £390 (I think I've worked out the USD equivalent correctly....). 

Hopefully the interest generated from this issue will allow us to seek some advertising, which will make future issues a less daunting prospect funding-wise.

We've also managed to claim a launch party at the Old Blue Last in London, where we'll be putting on Heart-ships, Us Baby Bear Bones and Hot Feet for free entry, to try and raise awareness of the 'zine and where our interests lie; in the heart of the reader and our shared love of music, fun and creativity.

This year the festival will be in San Francisco.  Even prior to founding TXYWC, Sheila had taken an Austin youth team to Nationals every year since 2003. </p>
<p>This organization and the work up to it's creation has touched and changed the lives of numerous youth over the last 10 years.  We desperately need your help to provide this opportunity.  For many, without this fundraising, attending BNV would not be possible.  The video above is a poem performed by three of last years team members on the final stage, a celebration and recognition of the work Sheila and Shannon created, work we deeply continue to believe in.  Please consider giving to our organization to help out.  The funds are used to pay for BNV attendance fees. </p>
<p>In order to attend, the team needs to raise over $6000 by June to cover the costs of travel, accommodations and registration for the event.  We have already raised $2000 from various shows and fundraising to help us pay for registration fees for the team...

All of these things are essential to help build awareness for the book. “The Last Prophet” book series is about reminding people where true heroes came from. All of the great writers, who have ever penned words to paper, have taken the basic inspiration and ideal of heroes from religious tales. David and Goliath, Moses, Christ, and Joan Arc are only a few examples. It is these stories that taught use the value of a true hero, a person we could look to with abilities, and morals greater then our own. A figure who could by example inspire us, to have faith, yearn to be better, and create a better tomorrow. Its from these stories we have been able to creature such inspirational heroes, it is with the same inspiration that I have chosen to create my own hero. A hero who draws his abilities and morals from the very same stem as these other figures. Not from radioactivity, technology, or outer space, but instead from the root of all morals, and great power. This tale is about the human race facing its annihilation from the evilest of all beings, and the rise of a true hero, a young man who must find faith within himself to become the savor mankind desperately needs. I would like to take a moment to briefly discuss the origin of this story. The storyline of The Last Prophet series has been one I have been creating since I was in high school.  I have always wanted to share my love for comic books, and the super heroes they represent. My passion and admiration for those stories inspired me to create my own hero. It wasn’t until I went to college that I found a way to really constructing this storyline. The Last Prophet became the focus of my screenwriting course, and inevitable final project. During college The Last Prophet universe was the storyline for many of my independent films. In 2011 I decided that the canvas of a book was where this story truly belonged. With no real limits, only the limits of one’s imagination, I knew this was the right way to reinvent, and expend the storyline. It was an elegant blend of my love for both comic books, and religion that gave birth to this novel.    </p>

<h3>Who I am and what this is about</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Ed Akehurst. I am writing a book that I hope will help many people for the reasons below.</p>
<p>I have been on a very diverse, interesting spiritual journey for most of my life and by sharing my stories, I am hopeful that others will benefit from it.</p>
<p>I was raised in the Christian church (Methodist) and was very active in it as a youth. I was a youth leader and even spent time working with the Billy Graham Crusades as a teen counselor. I was in the process of enrolling in seminary when I started having some serious spritual doubts. I had many questions and I either couldn't get answers to them or I was uncomfortable with the answers I recieved.</p>
<p>That led me to 20 years of self discovery. Some of it ""good"", some of it ""bad"", all of it helpful and important, and as it turns out, much needed.</p>
<p>I spent those 20 years ""trying out"" different faiths and philosophies, some of which included Wicca, Taoism, Buddhism, Native American spirituality, Humanism, and even Atheism. Some fit better than others, but none were a really good fit for me at that time in my life.</p>
<p>Then, in my late 30s, I was introduced to Advaita Vedanta, which is a school within traditional Hinduism. After a few years of self study and many personal discoveries, I eventually found my Guru and my spiritual home. I had arrived in a mental and spiritual place much different from where I started.</p>
<p>By sharing my stories and revelations along the way, others can be helped and made more secure in their own spiritual path, whatever that may be. More importantly, by understanding others and the journey they have been on, we can begin to have meaningful dialogue with them.</p>
<h3>Why is this important and who will it help?</h3>
<p>The purpose of getting this book written and released is not just to share my story, but to promote open, honest, caring interfaith dialogue. </p>
<p>It is not my intention to disparage or denigrate any other faith, nor to convert anyone to my way of thinking. Just because some of the the faiths I investigated were not a good fit for me does not mean they aren't a good fit for others. </p>
<p>Besides crafting an entertaining and enlightening tale, I hope to create greater understanding between people of differing faiths, especially between people of the Abrahamic and Dharmic faiths. </p>
<p>In this modern era, there is a lot of religious tension and even outright hatred. I am convinced that most of it can be reduced or even eliminated if we simply took the time to understood the people of other faiths and where they come from, emotionally, intellectually and spiritually. That understanding can bring us all closer together.</p>
<p>When we put our efforts into understanding others, rather than trying to change them or convince them we are right, then, and only then, can we truly know, love and honor them.</p>
<p>By shining a light on my personal journey, I am optimistic that people from all faiths will benefit.</p>
<p>If my personal journey can help others to be more loving and understanding towards each other, then this will have been a most worthwhile endeavor.</p>
<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>Please help me towards this goal. Initial monies raised from this project will allow me to spend more of my time getting the book written. If you can help me reach my goal or beyond, there will be sufficient funds to cover editing, formatting, cover art work, printing and promotion.</p>
<p>I am going to take initial funds and free up some of my time to do nothing but write. I write for a living, but it is mostly marketing pieces and in order to dedicate more time to the book, I need to be able to support my family.</p>
<p>The remaining funds are going to be used to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have the book properly edited and formatted;</li>
<li>Have cover artwork created;</li>
<li>Pay for the initial print run;</li>
<li>Do marketing and promotion to get the book widely dispersed. This will include press releases, advertisements, articles and interviews, social media campaigns. The amount of this I am able to do will depend entirely on how much funding comes in.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div>
<p>This book will be written and rewards will be granted whether the goal is reached. If I meet or exceed the goal, I expect to be in print in 60 - 90 days. If I do not reach the goal, it wil still get to print, but it may take longer, depending on how close to the goal you can help me get.</p>
<p>Check out the rewards to the right. I am giving away some great rewards for your help. I hope you enjoy them!</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, this book is intended to help many people.</p>
<p>There is value in knowing and understanding others. By seeing their journey and better understanding what it is they believe and why they believe it, we can better accept them for who they are.</p>
<p>As I grew up, I was taught things about other religions that were simply not true. They were based on fear and ignorance. if we can shine a light on some of that, we can end it. We can put ourselves in a place where we truly understand the other person and can accept them for who they are.</p>
<p>That is the place from which true, loving interfaith dialogue can begin.</p>
<p>That's the place where hatred, fear and intolerance disappear and are replaced with love, kindness and understanding.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope you are able to help. </p>

As a child I was taught,
“Give someone a fish and they’ll eat for a day, but teach someone to fish, and
they’ll eat for a lifetime.” I was raised to be a strong and determined
Christian man, ready to take on all challenges and challengers. I was inspired
the day I heard President Ronald Reagan’s first Inaugural Address as a kid at
daycare, and that I wanted to be just like him. 
 
The time has come. It has
been no secret to many of you that I have wanted to serve our community in
Jefferson City. While my life has taken many interesting and exciting turns, I
have never let the calling of public service disappear. As you may remember, in
October of 2008 I won “America’s Got Talent.” That experience put me on the map
in the music world, but I made sure it helped put our area and our great state
on the map worldwide.  I told
America where I came from because I am proud of Southeast Missouri. Remember,
you can never forget where you came from and be truly successful.
 
I take pride in our area and
all the small towns we cherish. I believe that the future success of the 149th
District is LIMITLESS! Rome wasn’t built in a day, and with my leadership, and
the lessons I’ve learned growing up here, we will continue to build upon the
strengths of our region and make it even more prosperous! 
 
Together, we can
tell Jefferson City who we are.  Please
take the time to make a contribution today!
 
Government is simply too
large and infringes on too many of our Liberties. We must end this practice now
or it could bury us, and our children, in generations of further debt and
potential despair. We need to eliminate burdensome
regulations, free up capital for job growth, and invigorate our local
economy.  Add to those proposals,
alternatives to Medicaid expansion to improve Healthcare, or even addressing how
Common Core must be stopped in order for us to maintain local educational
control. 
 
We have been placed in an
incredibly unique situation. We have been called to return our nation, and our
area, to its former economic glory! Our military prowess is unprecedented, but
our ability to stop inflation and reckless spending by some of our current
leaders is our generation’s next great challenge.  
 
I believe
it takes a clear vision, and a love for your home, in order to lead
effectively. There are some in our state legislature who hold seats and
accomplish very little simply because they are beholden to maintain the status
quo. Please ask these questions before you vote again:
“Do I believe my new state
representative will work diligently and fight to garner the attention needed
for our area to be revived and thrive? 
Can I trust my new representative to relate to my lifestyle and my
struggle in making a living for my family?  Has he experienced life
from a low-income perspective? Has he been educated in the school of hard
knocks, self-determination, and hard work overcoming tremendous odds to achieve

<p>This book was written after
many years of research and comparison between the <i>Torah,</i> Kabbalah, and
science books. I started on this subject following a personal crisis. I had the
opportunity of seeing people and phenomena beyond those experienced in the
daily life. “<i>Go out of Egypt,</i>” I was told. The meaning of it was to step
out of the material routine, and start dealing with spirituality. </p>
<p>  I tried to examine all new
information and study on the topic of the creation of the world, and the
connection between the <i>Torah</i> and science. I searched for proofs to this
connection in the most thorough way possible. Was the world created by
accident, or with an initial thought? What was the world created for? Is the
Big Bang the beginning of creation, or was the world created much earlier? What
is the universe made of? What maintains it? What will happen to the universe in
the future? When was man created? Was man created from the monkey? Is there any
kind of connection between all of humanity? How can you even research creation?
Can you possibly prove the existence of God? How can you even reach Him? Who
can provide answers to that?</p>
<p>The answers to these questions are
“hidden” in the <i>Torah</i>. The <i>Torah</i> is a secret language. The Hebrew
word for “world”, <i>Olam</i>, hints on the words: Hidden – <i>Ha’alem, Ne’lam.
</i>Scientists study the world every day, and the results of their studies are
surprisingly similar to the prophecies of the <i>Torah</i>. Jewish thinkers,
world intellectuals, and <i>tzadikim,</i> are able to find a connection with
the hidden worlds. They told us that there is a Creator to the world – God. The
world was created with initial thought: The thought of creation. Man has a
special and unique role in the world; to connect with the Creator by thinking
of, and helping his fellow men, “<i>Love your neighbor as yourself”</i>. The
nation of Israel is a “bridge” that connects the material world with the
Creator. Will we successfully climb the right bridge? Will man connect the
world and humanity? Will the nation of Israel successfully carry out its task?
“<i>Love your neighbor as yourself”...</i> this is how the soul is built. Let’s
connect to it… Good luck.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p> Right now, I have hard copies of the book in hebrew and a website in english and hebrew, you can see the website here:</p><p><a href=""http://www.thekingof.us/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.thekingof.us/</a></p><p> </p><p>I need an Amount of 4000$ for:</p><p>1. finish to translate the book to English.</p><p>2. make an eBook and improve the web site (Add the option to buy the book online, as hard copy or eBook)</p><ul><li>If I will not reach the goal I will improve the website right now but i will still translate the book and make an E book.</li></ul><h3>FAQ:</h3>

word for “world”, Olam, hints on the words: Hidden – Ha’alem, Ne’lam.
Scientists study the world every day, and the results of their studies are
surprisingly similar to the prophecies of the Torah. Jewish thinkers,
world intellectuals, and tzadikim, are able to find a connection with
the hidden worlds. They told us that there is a Creator to the world – God. The
world was created with initial thought: The thought of creation. Man has a
special and unique role in the world; to connect with the Creator by thinking
of, and helping his fellow men, “Love your neighbor as yourself”. The
nation of Israel is a “bridge” that connects the material world with the
Creator. Will we successfully climb the right bridge? Will man connect the
world and humanity? Will the nation of Israel successfully carry out its task?
“Love your neighbor as yourself”... this is how the soul is built. Let’s
connect to it… Good luck.What We Need & What You Get Right now, I have hard copies of the book in hebrew and a website in english and hebrew, you can see the website here:http://www.thekingof.us/ I need an Amount of 4000$ for:1. finish to translate the book to English.2. make an eBook and improve the web site (Add the option to buy the book online, as hard copy or eBook)If I will not reach the goal I will improve the website right now but i will still translate the book and make an E book.FAQ:

on Earth might be a bit overzealous even for me). The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
has recently passed legislation that will grant women suffrage and the right to
drive. It's finally understood that KSA, despite having the world's fastest growing economy, can never have a truly thriving nation when 60% of the population remains idle. Thank you, Jesus! (Muhammad?) These are exciting times in the Middle East
and I canâ€™t wait to jump in and be a part of this transition, even if from under an abaya (Saudi version of a burqa). Off to my genetic
homeland I go- where I plan to spend any and all spare time writing, writing, writing! in order to complete my story, have it edited and hopefully published!

My story will include:
Why I think my father has worked in intelligence at some point, despite his denials.
Accounts of the toads I've kissed- some renowned, some criminals, others just plain crazy, but still haven't found my match.
Accounts of experiences from every part of the social strata imaginable, on several continents.

So what is the Gift, you ask? It is several things, one being the gratitude I have in knowing that had I been raised in another culture I would not be encouraged to pursue my artistic pursuits.

I ask for your support in creating the synthesis that is my life: welding
the various parts of myself, my heritage, my cultures, my art and my roles as working
writer, educator, and humanist. Your kindness will help fund writing time and
pay for an editor to help me polish this work by Summer 2012. You are appreciated beyond what
could be expressed with pen. 


The Impact
I hope to impact, inspire and educate through my writing, my trials, travels, work and imagination.


What I Need & What You Get
I'm offering a copy of my written work to those who contribute to the costs associated with hiring an editor in order to get published. Being a working writer is not only the goal here, it is my only dream. Thank you for supporting me.


Other Ways You Can Help

<div>Woody Allen once wrote ""It's not that I'm afraid to die, I just don't want to be there when it happens."" His words probably mirror the thoughts of most human beings alive today: we try to ignore the fact of our own mortality by viewing death as something that  happens to other people, hiding the concept beyond our sight by employing euphemisms such as ""passed on"" (or with pets, ""went to sleep""). And no wonder – over the past few hundred years, humanity has gone from a blind religious faith in an afterlife, to a modern scientific vision of complete personal annihilation at the time of physical death (not to mention a life that has no overall consequence within the vast scale of the cosmos).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>For too long, the debate over the possibility of some sort of hereafter has been dominated by these two diametrically opposed views. So much so, that the general public is not aware that there is some very good evidence supporting the idea that, at the time of our physical death, some part of us 'continues on'. In the book I am currently writing, I will tell the story of how, for more than a hundred years, scientists have been finding evidence for consciousness continuing on beyond death; people have been recounting their own personal encounters with 'the other side of the veil'; and some of the world's best thinkers have been suggesting that human consciousness may be far more than just the accidental by-product of a flesh-and-blood brain. The evidence may not be concrete, but it's certainly enough for any person to hold a 'rational' belief that we all continue on in some way. <br/><br/>The ramifications of this possibility are profound for society, and deserve wider contemplation and discussion. What if our loved ones continue on beyond death, and we will someday be reunited? Should we pay more attention to the accounts of near-death experiencers, who are told on the 'other side' that the key components of life are to love and gain knowledge? And, if there is an afterlife, what does this mean for the way we approach our own deaths?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have written about these topics in short-form for almost 15 years now on my popular website <a href=""http://www.dailygrail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Daily Grail</a>, and in a number of books I have already published (see for example <a href=""http://www.dailygrail.com/essays/death-before-life-after-life"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this article</a>). I am an experienced publisher, having released a dozen books already through my independent publishing house, Daily Grail Publishing. Please help me bring this topic to a wider audience, in more detailed form, by supporting this book project.</div>
<div> </div>
<h3>What I Need, And What You'll Get</h3>
<div>
<p>I am already currently working on the book (20,000 words down at the time of writing), and it will be released no matter what level of support I receive - this has been a personal quest of mine for quite some time now. The goal of this pre-publication funding is to make the book as good as it can possibly be, by allowing funds for absolutely comprehensive research (tracking down/purchasing source documents, interviewing key people, freeing up time for writing, etc.) and book design/manufacture expenses. As such, I've made a very conservative estimate of $5000 as a goal to do this, though my ideal funding level is higher. However, I appreciate whatever support is offered by those interested in seeing this book published.</p>
<p>To raise the necessary funds, I'm offering a number of pre-publication packages for various levels of funding support, allowing YOU to become a co-creator of this book! For just $5, you can get one of the eBook editions (PDF, Kindle or ePub), DRM-free (meaning you can copy it around wherever you want, rather than being restricted). For a few dollars more, I'll send the pack of all 3 eBook editions, so you can read on whichever device you want (your computer, Kindle, iPad etc). For $20, you can get the eBook pack, and share it with/gift it to TEN other people, absolutely guilt-free. While there will be a paperback edition, I can't compete on price with online booksellers to offer a competitively-priced offer, but I am offering a $60 pack of a signed paperback plus the eBook gift pack for anybody that likes that price range. do offer two higher level packages for those that really want to help out, with the reward of limited edition hardcover editions, signed by myself, and with your name listed in the book as a key contributor (as well as the eBook pack) - if interested, see the side panel for the two packages on offer. I'm aiming to deliver these packages by November, with the book out for general sale before Christmas. All packages include paid (standard) postage expense to wherever you are.</p>
<h3>Got a Story to Tell?</h3>
<p>Beyond financial contributions, I'd be just as excited about content contributions. Are you a NDEr, or have some other story to tell about dying and the afterlife? Please do get in touch with me, I would love to hear from you!</p>
<h3>Help Spread the Word!</h3>
If you're ready to sign up and help bring this book to publication, thanks so much - it's a real pleasure and honour having you on board as a co-creator! I'm sure it's a win-win for everyone involved, and you'll enjoy the finished product immensely. But if even the $5 eBook is beyond your finances, I hope you can at least help me spread the word to others who might be interested, either through email or social media, or by using the share tools provided by IndieGoGo. I truly believe that this topic deserves more serious consideration. In the end, no matter what your spiritual/religious view (or lack thereof), we should all strive to do right by others, while living life to the fullest. But if we are attempting to understand who we are, and where we are going, in the grand scale of things, it's also important that we consider the idea that our consciousness may survive death. This book will be the ultimate resource for those who want to learn more.</div></div>","What's It All About?

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p><strong>These are difficult times for the guidebook publishing industry, with too many titles chasing too few readers. So even a guide to Beijing that receives reviews like these may wait a long time for a second edition:</strong></p>
<p><em>More than comprehensive.</em> ~ Holiday Asia</p>
<p><em>Fun but authoritative, the book is written in the strong voice of someone who loves poking around Beijing's hutongs, buzzing with pleasure at each new find... old China hands will even learn a thing or two. And the well-worn tourist attractions like the Forbidden City are given a new spin in a refreshing break from all the been-there-seen-that guides on the shelf.</em> ~ Time</p>
<p>This positive reception did eventually convince new owners of the publisher to commission a second edition. But after months had been spent tramping the streets of the Chinese capital and more in revising the text from start to finish, shrinking guidebook sales meant plans to cover China more comprehensively were cancelled and the rights to the text released.</p>
<p>Three other publishers expressed an interest in picking up the nearly complete work, but in the current economic climate eventually decided against publishing a comprehensive guide.</p>
<h3>Bring Beijing back to life</h3>
<p>This finally provides an opportunity to produce a really satisfying guide to Beijing, and one that visitors really need; one free of the restrictions that commercial publishers tend to impose.</p>
<p>Some of these restrictions are entirely sensible; for instance, keeping the number of pages down so as to reduce production costs and keep cover prices competitive. But some destinations just need more space to cover properly than others. Few countries change faster than China, yet publishers often request that a guide should be updated but without changing anything, in order to keep costs down.</p>
<p>While any visitor capable of tackling Paris without French can easily tackle Beijing without Mandarin, the tool they need to help them do this must be rather more detailed and sophisticated. Some publishers refuse to include Chinese characters, or severely restrict their numbers, making the book useless to readers who for instance need to show the characters for their destinations to taxi drivers and ticket sellers, or communicate their orders to waitresses.   Even the best-informed and most diligent Mandarin-speaking writers struggle to squeeze Beijing and everything that visitors need to know into the straightjacket of house styles and formats originally developed for European or North American destinations, but which the publisher insists may not be even slightly altered.</p>
<p>This project is all about not letting years of research go to waste. It's about completing the revision and expansion of an already well-reviewed book, putting its information and advice into the hands of as many visitors to Beijing as possible, and doing so for the lowest possible cover price. It's about making one more complete revision of the text before issuing it in a format especially devised for the needs of Chinese destinations and China travellers.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, if you want something done properly, do it yourself.</p>
<h3>Journalism</h3>
<p>Because that's what a really good guidebook should be.   The highest standards of accuracy and detail need to be brought to the text with every fact double-checked.</p>
<p>Despite guide book cover claims to the contrary, most publishers fail to do any significant amount of fact-checking.   And the text should be more than the hearsay and superficial generalisations common to many guides. It should include a wealth of readable background detail, observation, and original research. There's no need for guidebooks to be entirely trivial, to sugar-coat real life, or to highlight only the most appealing aspects of a destination with text that's been manipulated to match carefully cropped and Photoshopped images.</p>
<p>A guidebook should be something you reach for not only for opening hours, ticket prices, and transport information, but because of its readable background material, engaging stories, and fresh research that together advance enjoyment and understanding of a destination.   As <em>Time</em> said of the first edition:</p>
<p><em>A great guidebook... an infectious, informative read.</em></p>

So even a guide to Beijing that receives reviews like these may wait a long time for a second edition:
More than comprehensive. ~ Holiday Asia
Fun but authoritative, the book is written in the strong voice of someone who loves poking around Beijing's hutongs, buzzing with pleasure at each new find... old China hands will even learn a thing or two. And the well-worn tourist attractions like the Forbidden City are given a new spin in a refreshing break from all the been-there-seen-that guides on the shelf. ~ Time
This positive reception did eventually convince new owners of the publisher to commission a second edition. But after months had been spent tramping the streets of the Chinese capital and more in revising the text from start to finish, shrinking guidebook sales meant plans to cover China more comprehensively were cancelled and the rights to the text released.
Three other publishers expressed an interest in picking up the nearly complete work, but in the current economic climate eventually decided against publishing a comprehensive guide.
Bring Beijing back to life
This finally provides an opportunity to produce a really satisfying guide to Beijing, and one that visitors really need; one free of the restrictions that commercial publishers tend to impose.
Some of these restrictions are entirely sensible; for instance, keeping the number of pages down so as to reduce production costs and keep cover prices competitive. But some destinations just need more space to cover properly than others. Few countries change faster than China, yet publishers often request that a guide should be updated but without changing anything, in order to keep costs down.
While any visitor capable of tackling Paris without French can easily tackle Beijing without Mandarin, the tool they need to help them do this must be rather more detailed and sophisticated. Some publishers refuse to include Chinese characters, or severely restrict their numbers, making the book useless to readers who for instance need to show the characters for their destinations to taxi drivers and ticket sellers, or communicate their orders to waitresses.   Even the best-informed and most diligent Mandarin-speaking writers struggle to squeeze Beijing and everything that visitors need to know into the straightjacket of house styles and formats originally developed for European or North American destinations, but which the publisher insists may not be even slightly altered.
This project is all about not letting years of research go to waste. It's about completing the revision and expansion of an already well-reviewed book, putting its information and advice into the hands of as many visitors to Beijing as possible, and doing so for the lowest possible cover price. It's about making one more complete revision of the text before issuing it in a format especially devised for the needs of Chinese destinations and China travellers.
As the saying goes, if you want something done properly, do it yourself.
Journalism
Because that's what a really good guidebook should be.   The highest standards of accuracy and detail need to be brought to the text with every fact double-checked.
Despite guide book cover claims to the contrary, most publishers fail to do any significant amount of fact-checking.   And the text should be more than the hearsay and superficial generalisations common to many guides. It should include a wealth of readable background detail, observation, and original research. There's no need for guidebooks to be entirely trivial, to sugar-coat real life, or to highlight only the most appealing aspects of a destination with text that's been manipulated to match carefully cropped and Photoshopped images.
A guidebook should be something you reach for not only for opening hours, ticket prices, and transport information, but because of its readable background material, engaging stories, and fresh research that together advance enjoyment and understanding of a destination.   As Time said of the first edition:
A great guidebook... an infectious, informative read.
The second will be nearly twice the size, and the intention is that it should be twice as good.
Why ask for so little?
Obviously $5,000 is not remotely enough to cover the costs of several weeks' research in Beijing, not to mention further time at the keyboard and the necessary fact-checking, proof-reading, editing, and web page design, all of which are best done by those who know how, leaving me to concentrate on the text. But there's a determination to get this done, and it seems best to look for a very modest contribution and then try to exceed that target if at all possible.
Publishers now typically pay a flat fee for a city guide of only about $8,000, so it's perhaps unsurprising that few well-qualified writers want to tackle this work, and that many guidebooks suffer as their authors attempt to complete them as quickly as possible.

If we exceed $8000 then delivery of all copies to those choosing a $50 perk or higher will be post-free.
More funding still would also allow for updates to be incorporated swiftly in the months after first publication—one of the benefits of using print-on-demand technology.   $15,000+ would improve the book further, and make it possible to produce multiple updates, perhaps to print parts of the work as standalone volumes intended as supplements to other guides or to produce a companion volume on two- to three-day trips from Beijing or to revise and reissue China: The Silk Routes.
In general, the more funds, the better the results will be.

<h3>February 2013 Update!</h3>
<p>Ciao amici! With just a few days left in the campaign, it is unlikely that I'll meet my goal of $3,600. But I've raised enough for plane tickets, so there's no turning back. Cosa Nostra, here I come!</p>
<p>The book <em>will</em> be published, and it <em>will</em> contain the photos I take in this final shoot in Sicily. But it's not too late to join the campaign and help offset expenses.</p>
<p><strong>Closeout sale: </strong>Starting now, you can <strong>contribute at any level (yes, even at $5) to get on the private email list!</strong> You'll receive reports from the field as I run around Mafia zones trying to get the shot without getting shot. I exaggerate, of course, but these trips are always an adventure.</p>
<p>My two biggest challenges on this trip (besides money, and the unexpected) will be snowy mountain passes and trying to photograph locations in two mob-heavy cities I've never visited: Cannicattì &amp; Favara.</p>
<p><strong>Advance praise: </strong>""Carl Russo’s <em>The Sicilian Mafia: A True Crime Travel Guide </em>is a seminal piece of work that manages to bridge the gap between John Dickie’s <em>Cosa Nostra</em> and <em>Lonely Planet Sicily</em>."" — <a href=""http://www.croziergreen.com/pages/books_main.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Crozier Green</a>, author of <em>The Fratellanza Contract</em> and <em>Gladio Resurrection</em>.</p>
<p>(Mr. Green read an advance draft of the book and suggested a <strong>new subtitle</strong> for the book. My publishers and I really dig it, so we're replacing the rather generic <em>...An Illustrated Travel Guide</em>. I thank Mr. Green.)</p>
<h3>My Unusual Project</h3>
<p>In spring of 2006, the people of Sicily were celebrating more than the passing of another cruel winter. Italy's most-wanted Mafia chief, Bernardo Provenzano, had just been arrested after 43 years on the run. The headlines read like pulp fiction: Mafia godfather nabbed in shack outside Corleone surrounded by religious icons.</p>
<p>I happened to be traveling across the island a few weeks after Provenzano's capture. The godfather's shack: I had to see it! After two days of pestering Corleonese baristas and hotel staff, I located the tiny adobe hovel in the mountains above that Mafia stronghold of fact and fiction.</p>
<p>But that wasn't all. I was suddenly seized with the desire to see the place where the bullet-ridden body of the bandit Giuliano was photographed by reporters back in 1950. Where was <em>that</em>?</p>
<p>""There oughta be a book,"" I said. Famous last words.</p>
<p>First came the blog, <a href=""http://www.mafiaexposed.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Mafia Exposed"">Mafia Exposed</a>, filled with my photos of Sicilian Mafia hotspots: murder sites, police massacres, mob homes, hangouts, hideouts, the gravesites of dons and victims alike.

The softcover book is projected to have 275 pages and approximately 200 black-and-white photographs.</p>
<p>Despite the book deal, there is no money for a final trip to collect the last batch of locations. That's where <em>you</em> come in!</p>

<h3>A Mafia ""travel guide?""</h3>
<p>Sicily's position in the middle of Mediterranean trade routes made its people prey for numerous foreign powers through the millennia. Despite its unfortunate history, the island is unsurpassed in beautiful historical monuments, from ancient Greek temples to baroque churches. And don't forget beaches like paradise and food from heaven! Anyone who visits Sicily will never forget the experience.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is also synonymous with the Cosa Nostra, an ongoing phenomenon related to its turbulent past. What may seem to some like an insensitive book project is actually a way of shedding light on the problem. And light is always deleterious to the Mafia.</p>
<p>We're all interested in stories of the Mafia. No sense in denying our curiosity about criminality. Dozens of books about the Mafia are published each year in Italy, more than in any other country. To be sure, they are lurid. But they are written with respect for the victims and in solidarity with the strong anti-Mafia movement in that country.</p>
<p>It is in that spirit that I present the very first Sicilian Mafia travel guide in any language. No hotels or restaurant reviews. Just the down and dirty about locations you can see on your own travels, whether in Sicily or from the comfort of your armchair.</p>

<p>Aren’t you bored with cynical clichés? I am. Not because everything is okay, but because <em>we</em> make our own reality. This requires action, practice; not world-weary remarks.</p>
<p>This book will attempt to codify what is not working, followed by things we can do about it; not in some theoretical realm beyond personal influence, but in action each of us can do now. Starting with the way we think.</p>
<h3>The Industrial Age Is Over</h3>
<p>For the Ford factory to work, it needs workers and consumers. As long as those two exist then factories can keep spitting cars out, and the economy will keep growing.</p>
<p>This worked well for a few generations. Kids went to school, learned how to memorize, repeat, and make no errors. They then became reliable workers, cogs in some part of a plant. They married, consumed and procreated.</p>
<p>As long as you did as told, there was a house, wife, kids and dog allotted for you. For the process to work, it needs to be reliable. No risks, no failures. If you screwed up, it was your fault.</p>
<p>Then Thatcher and Reagan came to power and sent all manufacturing off-shore. Any work piece that could be turned into a repeatable process, was broken down, codified and sent to cheap workers around the globe.</p>
<p>It’s been going on for decades; the industrial model is disappearing from the Western World. And if we are to adapt, we need some urgent change too.</p>
<p>There is not too much we can change about the education we received. What we can do is rethink how we live the rest of our lives.</p>
<p>Instead of procreating new workers and consumers, we can pause and be. Instead of consuming, we can pull back and sustain. Instead of merely working, we can start creating.</p>
<p>There is no process or instructions for that. We need to stick our neck out. We need to <em>fail</em> before we have a chance in making it. We need to learn. Be creative.</p>
<p>This book is a manifesto for wholesome living.</p>

</ul></div>","Everyone, and their dog, seems ready to decry that there is something wrong in our world.
Aren’t you bored with cynical clichés? I am. Not because everything is okay, but because we make our own reality. This requires action, practice; not world-weary remarks.
This book will attempt to codify what is not working, followed by things we can do about it; not in some theoretical realm beyond personal influence, but in action each of us can do now. Starting with the way we think.
The Industrial Age Is Over
For the Ford factory to work, it needs workers and consumers. As long as those two exist then factories can keep spitting cars out, and the economy will keep growing.
This worked well for a few generations. Kids went to school, learned how to memorize, repeat, and make no errors. They then became reliable workers, cogs in some part of a plant. They married, consumed and procreated.
As long as you did as told, there was a house, wife, kids and dog allotted for you. For the process to work, it needs to be reliable. No risks, no failures. If you screwed up, it was your fault.
Then Thatcher and Reagan came to power and sent all manufacturing off-shore. Any work piece that could be turned into a repeatable process, was broken down, codified and sent to cheap workers around the globe.
It’s been going on for decades; the industrial model is disappearing from the Western World. And if we are to adapt, we need some urgent change too.
There is not too much we can change about the education we received. What we can do is rethink how we live the rest of our lives.
Instead of procreating new workers and consumers, we can pause and be. Instead of consuming, we can pull back and sustain. Instead of merely working, we can start creating.
There is no process or instructions for that. We need to stick our neck out. We need to fail before we have a chance in making it. We need to learn. Be creative.
This book is a manifesto for wholesome living.
Approach
Since publishing my previous book, “Mind Bind” last June, I focused on creating a potent online platform, via my blog. It’s now time to structure it all into one cohesive, readable and useful unit. I.e. a book.

I will self-publish. Vying for the attention of publishers is time and soul consuming. Need more reasons to self-publish? Read the best post on this topic by James Altucher.

There will be some illustration. This will include sketches I make. As needed, I may turn to professional help too, but the aim is to keep costs low.

The book’s thematic red-line will map to the Creatively Maladjusted Manifesto. I may make tweaks to reflect how the idea grew since its inception.

The aim of the book is to be one short cohesive read. It will develop and flow as a singular idea, and not a collection of random posts.

Ergo, I will create significant amounts of new but related content, whilst existing online work will need to be refreshed, cleaned-up, and updated.

I will use iA Writer for capturing new text. I will try Scrivener to manage existing blocks of content in one cohesive project. Same as with “Mind Bind”, I will use Adobe InDesign for formatting and presentation for both print and Kindle exports. OmniGraffle will be used as needed for diagrams. As for iPad I intend to try Apple’s iBooks Author, but we’re nowhere near that stage yet.

I will post regular updates of my work on my blog. This will a) keep me accountable and motivated and b) encourage feedback and contributions from interested friends.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p class=""TrainingText"">Hi, I’m Anne, and I’m an Atomic Tourist and Writer (my business cards even say so). What the heck does this mean? Well, I visit sites important to the Atomic Age—fallout shelters, atomic blast sites, secret cities—and then write about them. In fact the fine folks over at <em>McSweeney’s</em> even let me write a column about the stuff.

In other words, Anne’s Wheelhouse = Nuclear Stuff. Second, we’re forgetting about the Atomic Age. I want to do what I can to prevent the Atomic Age from sliding headlong into the shadows of the conspiracy theory set. It’s interesting! And entertaining! Let’s remember it!</p>
<p class=""TrainingText"">My aim is to enlighten and entertain everyone with some really cool travel writing about some awesomely nerdy, downright wacky at times, nearly forgotten places from our history.</p>
<p class=""TrainingText"">I’ve been to a good number of Atomic Tourist sites, but am quickly making it through my stockpile of visited sites to use as topics for my column, and low on funds to visit more. This is where you come in dear friends!

<h2 class=""TrainingH2"">Plan</h2>
<p class=""TrainingText"">I have narrowed down my list of sites to visit to seven. There are many, many more sites to visit than this, but one bite of the atomic pie at a time.</p>

<p class=""TrainingText"">The Smithsonian, well duh.</p>
<p class=""TrainingText"">The Greenbrier Resort is home to the once secret congressional fallout shelter. The shelter is part of the resort, and was super secret until a few years ago when information about the site was leaked. Now you can tour it for thirty bucks!</p>

<h3 class=""TrainingH3"">5.  Hanford, Washington</h3>
<p class=""TrainingText"">The Hanford Site is a mostly decommissioned nuclear production site. The first plutonium production reactor lives here. Plutonium from this site was used in the first atomic bomb as well as Fat Man, which was used on Nagasaki.</p>

<ul>
<li class=""TrainingText"">Three Mile Island was the site of a kind of awful nuclear accident in 1979.</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Back in June of 2012, whilst the world was seemingly heading towards an apocalypse, I had a moment of clarity and said ""Enough. I’m never gonna work for the Man again."" At that same time, a woman whose opinion I respect read my master's thesis and told me, ""You are a writer. You NEED to write."" And then I had a motorcycle accident, which was actually destiny calling. </p>
<p>I was given $800/month of disability, and with nothing else to do, I followed my heart and it led me to Valparaiso, Chile. There I immersed myself in the art and craft of fiction, poetry and theater, and the city's pulse became my own. </p>
<p>I wanted to write non-fiction, a handbook for how to live out my pet-philosophy, pan-experientialism (everything is somewhat sentient), but instead focused on my own experience in that wild town, and began experimenting with the idea of life as fiction--a novel we create--weaving together our stories with the stories of friends, enemies, neighbors and lovers. Valparaiso is a poet's garden, an organic, throbbing city, a place that has always resisted the prototypical Spanish urge to contain space in neat, square columns and rows. The labyrinths of graffiti, the hills rising up from the bay, the constant presence of music and art, and most of all the colorful characters that call Valparaiso home, all inspired me to use my heart as a compass, and see what I could find. It was a glorious time.  </p>
<p>Then I ran out of money, and came back. I did earn a few piasters this summer working for Outward Bound, and as a guide in Yosemite, but I still need some help to support my new habit of telling tales of an emerging paradigm. I am launching myself in the direction of destiny, and you are my rocket fuel.  The definition of adventure is that success is not assured. I booked my flight back to Chile with the certainty that it WAS the place I needed to write but without full resources to complete the work. I have a manuscript in hand, but it needs to have the breath of Valparaiso blown into it. That's why I'm leaving, to f<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">ollow in the footsteps of Miller, Kerouac, Steinbeck and Robbins, to set out on the mystic highway, riding the tip of the spear, piercing the veil that hides not only the essence of everything around us, but keeps us from knowing even our own true selves. I invite you to join me on this playful, yet evocative journey of mind, body and soul in the California that might have been, a Paradise for those who thought they’d lost it —Valparaiso, Chile. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I booked the cheapest flight I could find for Chile, knowing that I didn't have enough funds to sustain me for very long. Work there is poorly-paid, and I am investing that time in my future by completing this, my first novel. </p>
<p>Your support will allow me to live for a few months in South America, where I can bring the process to a finish. Upon my return in the Spring, I will see that the work gets published, either by an actual publishing house, or if need be, by my own hand. Every level of support will result in you getting a signed 1st edition copy of the novel, and the satisfaction that you helped me to achieve this somewhat weighty goal. I thank you in advance for your generosity and love. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The purpose of a novel, according to Milan Kundera, is to reveal some aspect of life that has hitherto remained hidden. In this work, I am experimenting with 'real' life--to what extent do we determine what happens to us? Where does one's will end and the world come in? What is the power of the word? Do the stories we tell ourselves really make a difference? How can we create the experience of paradise in our lives here on Earth? </p>
<p>This all began from an environmentalist's perspective, some years back. What I've discovered is that we are in great need of a shift in VALUES, specifically from materialism to non-materialism. We need to value our EXPERIENCE primarily, and other's experience of us. I believe that reading this book will help people to ""get it.""</p>

<p><strong><br/>THE BACKSTORY</strong></p>
<p>Since 1994, the mission of PlayGround has been to support the development of new voices for the theatre. For almost two decades, PlayGround has been a leading playwright incubator, providing unique opportunities for the cultivation and development of early-career local playwrights and partnerships with leading professional directors, actors, theatres and theatre lovers. In 2012, PlayGround expanded to Los Angeles with the launch of PlayGround-LA and its inaugural season in residence at the Zephyr Theatre.</p>
<p>Through the development of original short (and eventually full-length) plays, PlayGround-LA creates a microcosm of the greater theatre scene, supporting emerging playwrights' experimentation and risk-taking, while helping them hone their style and technique.</p>
<p><strong><br/>PUBLISH OR PERISH</strong></p>
<p>For the past twelve years, PlayGround Publications has promoted the work of scores of emerging new playwrights and their short plays through the <em>Best of PlayGround</em> series of anthologies.</p>
<p>In mid-May, PlayGround Publications will print two new <em>Best of PlayGround 2013</em> anthologies. You can help us in this mission by pre-ordering copies of the Los Angeles book through this Indiegogo funding campaign.</p>
<p>The book contains six scripts as performed at this year’s Best of PlayGround Gala new plays showcase (May 13, 2013). These six plays were selected as the best this season from more than 100 submissions and thirty-six works developed through the Monday Night PlayGround staged reading series.</p>
<p>Each script is printed in its entirety, creating an historical record of the development of these plays, with dates of first reading and premiere, original casting information and playwright biographies.</p>
<p>Proceeds of this funding campaign will be used exclusively to print and distribute the Best of PlayGround Los Angeles anthology.</p>
<p>The <em>Best of PlayGround </em>anthologies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Celebrate the best short plays of the past season;</li>
<li>Provide an economical way to bring high-quality audience-tested scripts to the attention of producers and educators;</li>
<li>Promote the work of new generations of talented playwrights;</li>

THE BACKSTORY
Since 1994, the mission of PlayGround has been to support the development of new voices for the theatre. For almost two decades, PlayGround has been a leading playwright incubator, providing unique opportunities for the cultivation and development of early-career local playwrights and partnerships with leading professional directors, actors, theatres and theatre lovers. In 2012, PlayGround expanded to Los Angeles with the launch of PlayGround-LA and its inaugural season in residence at the Zephyr Theatre.
Through the development of original short (and eventually full-length) plays, PlayGround-LA creates a microcosm of the greater theatre scene, supporting emerging playwrights' experimentation and risk-taking, while helping them hone their style and technique.
PUBLISH OR PERISH
For the past twelve years, PlayGround Publications has promoted the work of scores of emerging new playwrights and their short plays through the Best of PlayGround series of anthologies.
In mid-May, PlayGround Publications will print two new Best of PlayGround 2013 anthologies. You can help us in this mission by pre-ordering copies of the Los Angeles book through this Indiegogo funding campaign.
The book contains six scripts as performed at this year’s Best of PlayGround Gala new plays showcase (May 13, 2013). These six plays were selected as the best this season from more than 100 submissions and thirty-six works developed through the Monday Night PlayGround staged reading series.
Each script is printed in its entirety, creating an historical record of the development of these plays, with dates of first reading and premiere, original casting information and playwright biographies.
Proceeds of this funding campaign will be used exclusively to print and distribute the Best of PlayGround Los Angeles anthology.
The Best of PlayGround anthologies:

Celebrate the best short plays of the past season;
Provide an economical way to bring high-quality audience-tested scripts to the attention of producers and educators;
Promote the work of new generations of talented playwrights;
Provide students and new dramatists with models of plays that have proven popular with audiences;
Creates an historical record of the development of these plays.
This year PlayGround is expanding the role of these books to help move the work of its talented emerging writers from page and into production.
The 2013 Los Angeles anthology contains complete scripts of the following plays:

<div>Dear Friends,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<br/>I'll be turning 25 this year, and all I want for my first quarter century is the freedom to write. I've been working through a series of promising drafts but need some  time to collect my own thoughts. When I started this campaign, I needed to raise $3,000 to cover the 2 month summer break in my job. I have since secured a part time job to cover part of those costs, but still need your help! Your contributions will help pay rent, health insurance, and other necessities to support my writing during this time. More importantly, they will also allow me to move from a 347 sq. ft. studio to a one bedroom apartment within walking distance from work. I need this added space to house my first kitchen table and writing desk, and to feel a bit more like myself as i'm starting to grown again.  Here are a few of the projects i'm working on and how you can help! </div>
<div>
<p><span><strong>A Screenplay Called ""Near Death Experiences"":</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>""Near Death Experinces"" is a  coming of age story about wrestling new frontiers in our everyday lives, or average existences, as seen from a transgender child’s view. Its about using play to work through those narratives and trying to understand our own pasts. The story draws on many elements of local history-- from the space race to  old western images-- to challenge the bounds of whats possible and question our progress collectively. As many of you know, this project also took on new meaning for me when my friend passed away several weeks ago. So, it is also a very personal story, as I explore my own pasts in this place [C. Springs] and in queer/trans movements more generally. I've never written a screenplay before, so I welcome opportunities to collaborate or discuss this new medium, and would <span>love to host a dialogue on the challenges inherant to writing it-- from questions about cultural reapropriation to the pressure of producing a draft for funding purposes.  </span>I also have a lot to give back and teach in this conversation, based on my academinc work on transgender history and politics and my work as a facilitator for the TransCampus project. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><em>You can sponsor a 10 page autoethnography for Near Death Experiences, or any 10 page story on the theme of your choice, for only $50! Ill send each sponsor a signed and bound copy of my favorite 5 stories by Christmas time. I only need 5 sponsors to make this perk possible! </em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A  Written Work with Multi-Site Installation /Performance Called M-Theory:</strong></p>
<p>“M-Theory” is a re-telling of the relationship between Mary and Christ, staged in the big bang of our universe. This largely experimental project has been in the works for nearly two years, and I am only just now beginning to understand its significance within my own writing practices. While part of this project engages written forms such as prose and poetry, there is also a performative element that i am beginning to explore in multiple mediums. This summer, I hope to bring together a series of staged Sunday sermons that re-position the storyteller as a community organizer / activist who is not tied to traditional sites, methods, or narratives around social justice work, which presents its own barriers to the construction of social change. One of these staged Sunday sermons is partially inspired by Dr. Cornell West's talk ""The Gifts of Black Folk in the Age of Terrorism"". I hope to draw on my thesis work to write on the critical gifts of queer/trans communities and hope it will inform my work on Near Death Experiences. If theatrical sermons arent your thing, i'm also writing a show in my tub about the resurrection and baptism that's meant to be viewed from outside my window sill. If you'd rather I come to a party near you, just ask about my travelling preacher piece!  </p>

</ul>
<p><br/><strong>Creative Economy: </strong></p>
<p>I'm interested in re-defining our personal and collective economies to create a better community. This project is about building and mapping relationships as I explore diverse forms and systems of capital-- social, economic, and otherwise.  I've sometimes struggled to build strong, intimate and/personally meaningful relationships in C. Springs, so this is an individual attempt to circualte ideas and resources more creatively and with greater autonomy than normative structures sometimes allow.</p>

<li><em>A) Ill send you you an original, 18 x 24 handwritten poster exploring the idea of your choice and mail a letter each month for a year. </em></li>
<li><em>B) I will work with you one-on-one for up to 6 hours collaboration on the writing component  of one of your projects via email or Skype.</em></li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This is a book about turning your great idea into an actual business and includes many antidotes and stories from my personal experiences and businesses that I have worked with and for.</p>
<p>I recently started my own consulting business where I work with small businesses mainly with finances, but also with marketings, sales, brand development, and HR. I got the idea for the book from starting to blog about business topics on my business website (<a href=""http://www.brownconsultingwork.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.brownconsultingwork.com</a>).</p>
<p>If you are interested, you can view a chapter preview on my website...</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The goal for this first round of 60 days is to raise $500 for the first run of published books. I have chosen to publish the book myself in hardback as well as paperback through an online publishing/printing company. 100% of the money raised will go towards publishing costs. The more money that is raise, the more books I am able to initially publish.</p>
<p>The reason for the campaign here is to obviously raise money to help finance the publishing cost. Just like most normal people, I do not have a spare $2,000 or $3,000 to publish everything all at once, so I am looking at doing this in stages. The book is in the editing process currently and should be ready for pick up in Dec 2013.</p>

<h3>The Prologue</h3>
<div>
<p>(Morningstar:) ""Sometimes we aren't sure what our purpose is - what we’re here to do. We go through most of our lives not knowing what we want or believing we can get it, until one day we wake up no longer leading our lives, but being led by them... by others. Like self-made, masochistic marionettes, we drive razor-sharp hooks deep into our emotions, our fears, our insecurities, and then hand over the strings to anyone who fits the profile of a crazed bull in a china shop. I used to be like that; the strings had been in others’ hands so long I couldn't remember how they were tied to me in the first place so I could pull the damn things out and finally taste the freedom from the darkness my eroding soul craved. But that’s the beauty about living in total darkness – even the faintest light can be seen, no matter how far away it is. The hard part for most of us, is taking those first steps towards it...</p>
<p>Those first steps were as invisible as the wind to me; I couldn't see the path before me, but I knew one was there. Some people seek advice in their time of need, but trust was not a luxury to me. Maybe it was my pride, or confidence, or the shattered fragments of a past too trusting. Either way, it really doesn't matter, because I know life is what you make it and legacy is how you leave it. Stop trying to be perfect, stop waiting for perfection to find you, and start making your environment a product of you instead of the other way around.</p>
<p>If you want to break out of your cycle of disappointment, listen closely; wait too long, and the only disappointment will be you. There are two kinds of people in the world: the puppets and the puppeteers. I'm not going to give you any generalized advice like that self-help nonsense, because generalized advice is about as useful as poisons and blades are in the hands of the inexperienced. No - instead, let me tell you a story, my story, so you can know specifically what happened and draw the conclusions you need for yourself. You’re smarter than you think with more potential than you know; realize this, and your rebirth will rival that of a phoenix from the ashes; you will know as I know, that true captivity lies not in the hands of those above you, nor around you, but within you. Break the chains that your independence has come to know all-too-well, and the world, and everything in it, can be yours.""</p>
</div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What ""Rise of the Morningstar"" (the book) is about</h3>
<p>""Rise of the Morningstar"", the first book in a five-book series, is the story of a good guy's evolution to villainy. It begins with Morningstar, a hard-working good guy who realizes his life isn't going quite how he wants it to; he works hard, but it seems like no matter how hard he works or how good he is, things just don't go his way. At his breaking point, he goes all-for-broke and starts taking back control of his life, soon realizing the power of his choices. But those choices do not come without consequence; the more he changes things and starts to manipulate the people around him, the more it begins to change him as well, and he finds it harder and harder to remain the good guy...</p>

<h3>Who this ""A. J. Darkholme"" (the author) guy is</h3>
<p>A. J. Darkholme is an author, poet, tech-enthusiast, philosopher, teacher, entrepreneur, pun-master, and daydreamer extraordinaire! But behind all that, for those who know me, it is the ""pen name"" I will write under as the experiences of my life merge with the stories of my imagination to produce stories as deep, insightful, and informative as they are entertaining. There's nothing I'd love more than to start a career where I can help people bring positive changes to their lives through poetic prose; to help people recalibrate their thinking and emotional releases into productive outlets that lace the path of their future with jewels instead of potholes.</p>

<div style=""margin-bottom: 30px;"">
<h3>How this campaign came to be</h3>
<p>Have you ever reached a point in your life where you wonder if where you are is where you're meant to be? I think when we start asking ourselves that question, we become gatekeepers to a world of possibility: a world where dreams don't have to be limited to imagination, but can be made reality.</p>
<p>The thing is, when you look for advice on this kind of thing, it's usually pretty sappy and lame, or is an untimely force-fed lesson taught by someone who hasn't really learned it and lived it themselves. We're observant, stubborn hopefuls, and that's just how most of us roll. Teenagers rebel because they are frustrated with the people around them and want to learn and do things for themselves without being told they can't or when they need to be done something by. And as adults... well, we're mostly just more experienced, better-paid teenagers. Either way, we're all looking to define ourselves and find a purpose in life that can make us happy.</p>
<p>Realizing this, especially balancing my experience as a teacher with my experience as a worker bee in a corporate cubicle, I started observing the world a little more closely, trying to pin-point how people learn most effectively and what gives them the most happiness. And you know what I found? You know what the secret is?</p>
<p>People like to be entertained.</p>
<p>There is freedom in entertainment: a reality that feels like an escape from reality. When we're entertained, we're much more willing to listen to - and sometimes even *do* - almost anything someone says because we're engaged in the appeal and charisma of it.</p>
<p>So I wrote a book - a ""self-help fantasy"" book - full of grounded, purpose-imbuing advice, interlaced with well-researched Psychology concepts, all tied together under a mask of entertainment. It reads like Harry Potter or Twilight (Well maybe not Twilight so much... lol) on the surface, but subliminally teaches you how to reconcile with your past, accept the present, and not just wonder about your future, but show you how to make it a direct and expected result of what you start doing today.</p>
<p>Interested? Pledge and contribute to make the dream a reality!</p>
</div>
<div style=""margin-bottom: 30px;"">
<h3>What I need &amp; what you'll get</h3>
<p>The book is SUPER close to being fully written! But when a self-publishing author is finished writing, that's when the free-ride is over and some money is needed to take the story from the hard drive to the book stores! I need about $5000 - $7000 in total, broken up as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proofreading - ~$250</li>
<li>Professional editing (the major cost) - $0.04/word doesn't sound like much at first, but with an 80,000 word novel, it works out to be about $3200.</li>
<li>Cover design/layout - ~$450</li>
<li>Cover artist - $500 (Shichigoro, an amazing artist in Japan) </li>
<li>Interior design/writing layout - ~$250</li>
<li>ISBN Number - Free for Canada (yay!), $125 for each individual ISBN in the US ($250 for a bundle of 10)</li>
<li>Printer/Distributor Setup Fees - I've chosen Lightning Source as my printing/distributing company, who charges $75 for this.</li>
<li>Distribution - $12+/year for online distribution (Print-On-Demand). Depending how much you pledge, I can also publish in different countries and continents for more wide-spread distribution!</li>
<li>A proof copy - $30 (including shipping). This is the final printed copy to look at and read through before it's made fully sellable.</li>
<li>Promotion/Marketing - ~$5500 (I'll go with a local business in Winnipeg to help the ""little guys"" stay alive and thrive)</li>
</ul>
<p>Help me raise <strong>*more*</strong> than that, and I'll take some of that generousity and put into distribution of free copies to schools and organizations that can't afford to purchase new books! Everything extra will go into marketing and promotion to give it as much of a widespread channel as possible.</p>

<h3 id=""excerpts"">Some excerpts from the book so far</h3>
<p>Since you can't judge a book by it's cover (although it's a pretty awesome cover), here's some of what's inside. <strong>The more you help me raise, the more quotes I'll post!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<div style=""font-style: italic;"">
<p><strong>Unlocked Excerpt 1: Awareness</strong></p>
<p>""What seems like a flaw is merely our higher consciousness telling us we’re not looking at it in the right light yet.""</p>
<p><strong>Unlocked Excerpt 2: Trust</strong></p>
<p>""Trust is not a gasoline-soaked blanket that succumbs to the matches of betrayal, never able to be used for its warmth again; it’s a tapestry that wears thin in places, but can be patched over if you have the right materials, circumstances, and patience to repair it. If you don’t, you’re the one who feels the coldest when Winter comes.""</p>
<p><strong>Unlocked Excerpt 3: Purpose</strong></p>
<p>""Some people experience a life-changing sensation that transforms how they see the world after a near-death experience, but the way I see it, we’re all dying – nay, we’re all dead – and it is up to us to be our own self-necromancers to find some form of life and spirit to reanimate the corpse of a life spent wanting.""</p>
<p><strong>Unlocked Excerpt 4: Wooing</strong></p>
<p>""A man is no more than breath until his breath fashions the words that others cannot forget. But you my darling, are worthy of words not yet imagined – words woven to perfection from the fibres that make envy grow in the hearts of goddesses. Though such words escape me, your presence has infused into my being every aspect of bliss that a life of happiness demands. Every day that I catch but a glimpse of you renews a satisfaction in me that even the greediest or luckiest men could only hope for, yet never have for themselves, because as long as I get to call you mine, I shall never be found wanting. Since the first time I saw you, my eyes had never presented me with beauty more deserving of the word’s connotations.""</p>

(Morningstar:) ""Sometimes we aren't sure what our purpose is - what we’re here to do. We go through most of our lives not knowing what we want or believing we can get it, until one day we wake up no longer leading our lives, but being led by them... by others. Like self-made, masochistic marionettes, we drive razor-sharp hooks deep into our emotions, our fears, our insecurities, and then hand over the strings to anyone who fits the profile of a crazed bull in a china shop. I used to be like that; the strings had been in others’ hands so long I couldn't remember how they were tied to me in the first place so I could pull the damn things out and finally taste the freedom from the darkness my eroding soul craved. But that’s the beauty about living in total darkness – even the faintest light can be seen, no matter how far away it is. The hard part for most of us, is taking those first steps towards it...
Those first steps were as invisible as the wind to me; I couldn't see the path before me, but I knew one was there. Some people seek advice in their time of need, but trust was not a luxury to me. Maybe it was my pride, or confidence, or the shattered fragments of a past too trusting. Either way, it really doesn't matter, because I know life is what you make it and legacy is how you leave it. Stop trying to be perfect, stop waiting for perfection to find you, and start making your environment a product of you instead of the other way around.
If you want to break out of your cycle of disappointment, listen closely; wait too long, and the only disappointment will be you. There are two kinds of people in the world: the puppets and the puppeteers. I'm not going to give you any generalized advice like that self-help nonsense, because generalized advice is about as useful as poisons and blades are in the hands of the inexperienced. No - instead, let me tell you a story, my story, so you can know specifically what happened and draw the conclusions you need for yourself. You’re smarter than you think with more potential than you know; realize this, and your rebirth will rival that of a phoenix from the ashes; you will know as I know, that true captivity lies not in the hands of those above you, nor around you, but within you. Break the chains that your independence has come to know all-too-well, and the world, and everything in it, can be yours.""

 
What ""Rise of the Morningstar"" (the book) is about
""Rise of the Morningstar"", the first book in a five-book series, is the story of a good guy's evolution to villainy. It begins with Morningstar, a hard-working good guy who realizes his life isn't going quite how he wants it to; he works hard, but it seems like no matter how hard he works or how good he is, things just don't go his way. At his breaking point, he goes all-for-broke and starts taking back control of his life, soon realizing the power of his choices. But those choices do not come without consequence; the more he changes things and starts to manipulate the people around him, the more it begins to change him as well, and he finds it harder and harder to remain the good guy...

Who this ""A. J. Darkholme"" (the author) guy is
A. J. Darkholme is an author, poet, tech-enthusiast, philosopher, teacher, entrepreneur, pun-master, and daydreamer extraordinaire! But behind all that, for those who know me, it is the ""pen name"" I will write under as the experiences of my life merge with the stories of my imagination to produce stories as deep, insightful, and informative as they are entertaining. There's nothing I'd love more than to start a career where I can help people bring positive changes to their lives through poetic prose; to help people recalibrate their thinking and emotional releases into productive outlets that lace the path of their future with jewels instead of potholes.
Feel free to follow my career as it develops at:http://www.mistero.co/aj-darkholme/http://www.facebook.com/ajdarkholme@AJDarkholme (https://www.twitter.com/ajdarkholme)
Hope to see you there!


How this campaign came to be
Have you ever reached a point in your life where you wonder if where you are is where you're meant to be? I think when we start asking ourselves that question, we become gatekeepers to a world of possibility: a world where dreams don't have to be limited to imagination, but can be made reality.
The thing is, when you look for advice on this kind of thing, it's usually pretty sappy and lame, or is an untimely force-fed lesson taught by someone who hasn't really learned it and lived it themselves. We're observant, stubborn hopefuls, and that's just how most of us roll. Teenagers rebel because they are frustrated with the people around them and want to learn and do things for themselves without being told they can't or when they need to be done something by. And as adults... well, we're mostly just more experienced, better-paid teenagers. Either way, we're all looking to define ourselves and find a purpose in life that can make us happy.
Realizing this, especially balancing my experience as a teacher with my experience as a worker bee in a corporate cubicle, I started observing the world a little more closely, trying to pin-point how people learn most effectively and what gives them the most happiness. And you know what I found? You know what the secret is?
People like to be entertained.
There is freedom in entertainment: a reality that feels like an escape from reality. When we're entertained, we're much more willing to listen to - and sometimes even *do* - almost anything someone says because we're engaged in the appeal and charisma of it.
So I wrote a book - a ""self-help fantasy"" book - full of grounded, purpose-imbuing advice, interlaced with well-researched Psychology concepts, all tied together under a mask of entertainment. It reads like Harry Potter or Twilight (Well maybe not Twilight so much... lol) on the surface, but subliminally teaches you how to reconcile with your past, accept the present, and not just wonder about your future, but show you how to make it a direct and expected result of what you start doing today.
Interested? Pledge and contribute to make the dream a reality!


What I need & what you'll get
The book is SUPER close to being fully written! But when a self-publishing author is finished writing, that's when the free-ride is over and some money is needed to take the story from the hard drive to the book stores! I need about $5000 - $7000 in total, broken up as follows:

Proofreading - ~$250
Professional editing (the major cost) - $0.04/word doesn't sound like much at first, but with an 80,000 word novel, it works out to be about $3200.
Cover design/layout - ~$450
Cover artist - $500 (Shichigoro, an amazing artist in Japan) 
Interior design/writing layout - ~$250
ISBN Number - Free for Canada (yay!), $125 for each individual ISBN in the US ($250 for a bundle of 10)
Printer/Distributor Setup Fees - I've chosen Lightning Source as my printing/distributing company, who charges $75 for this.
Distribution - $12+/year for online distribution (Print-On-Demand). Depending how much you pledge, I can also publish in different countries and continents for more wide-spread distribution!
A proof copy - $30 (including shipping). This is the final printed copy to look at and read through before it's made fully sellable.
Promotion/Marketing - ~$5500 (I'll go with a local business in Winnipeg to help the ""little guys"" stay alive and thrive)

Help me raise *more* than that, and I'll take some of that generousity and put into distribution of free copies to schools and organizations that can't afford to purchase new books! Everything extra will go into marketing and promotion to give it as much of a widespread channel as possible.
As for what you'll get - check out the perks for pledging on the right side! If you have any other ideas or requests, let me know and I'll add it as a new tier!


Some excerpts from the book so far
Since you can't judge a book by it's cover (although it's a pretty awesome cover), here's some of what's inside. The more you help me raise, the more quotes I'll post!
 

Unlocked Excerpt 1: Awareness
""What seems like a flaw is merely our higher consciousness telling us we’re not looking at it in the right light yet.""
Unlocked Excerpt 2: Trust
""Trust is not a gasoline-soaked blanket that succumbs to the matches of betrayal, never able to be used for its warmth again; it’s a tapestry that wears thin in places, but can be patched over if you have the right materials, circumstances, and patience to repair it. If you don’t, you’re the one who feels the coldest when Winter comes.""
Unlocked Excerpt 3: Purpose
""Some people experience a life-changing sensation that transforms how they see the world after a near-death experience, but the way I see it, we’re all dying – nay, we’re all dead – and it is up to us to be our own self-necromancers to find some form of life and spirit to reanimate the corpse of a life spent wanting.""
Unlocked Excerpt 4: Wooing
""A man is no more than breath until his breath fashions the words that others cannot forget. But you my darling, are worthy of words not yet imagined – words woven to perfection from the fibres that make envy grow in the hearts of goddesses. Though such words escape me, your presence has infused into my being every aspect of bliss that a life of happiness demands. Every day that I catch but a glimpse of you renews a satisfaction in me that even the greediest or luckiest men could only hope for, yet never have for themselves, because as long as I get to call you mine, I shall never be found wanting. Since the first time I saw you, my eyes had never presented me with beauty more deserving of the word’s connotations.""

<h3>Keeping Karl on Parl<br/>
</h3>
<p>""Karl Nerenberg has emerged as one of the real bright thinkers on Ottawa politics.  You won't read this analysis in the mainstream media."" ~ MP Charlie Angus. <br/></p>
<p>Make something good come out of Parliament - Karl Nerneberg's reporting.  We need a reporter for the rest of us and with your help we can make it happen. <br/></p>
<p>Since 2001 rabble.ca<a href=""http://www.rabble.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">,</a> a non-profit media organization, has been offering news and views on Canadian and world politics to the world. rabble is 100% free to access. We make ends meet through community support (individuals and organizations that support us). In other words, we are a community supported media site.  <br/></p>
<p>In 2011, frustrated with the news coverage of Parliament and the Prime Minister's Office in Canada, we crowd-funded a journalist to cover news on the Hill for the rest of us. Readers (and a few organizations) came through and we sent award-winning reporter Karl Nerenberg to the Hill. <br/><br/>Karl promised to bring new stories and perspectives to Parliamentary Hill reporting <a href=""http://rabble.ca/features/series/hill-dispatches"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">and he delivered</a>. Karl writes dozens and dozens and dozens of stories that matter. He goes to Parliament hearings that others miss (even the super boring ones), he digs through the bills to find what is really going on, he looks at the long-view.  In other words, he brings you real news.  He tells stories about the environment, stories about immigration, stories about health care, stories about working people -  stories about politics.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The perks of political coverage <br/>
</h3>
<p>Each year we raise funds to send Karl to Parliament and keep him reporting on the news that matters. The result is important news coverage that is shared with the world. <br/><br/>Our goals this year is to raise $25,000 to cover the year. We aim to raise $5,000 directly from our rabble.ca visitors through an on-site campaign  (and are almost there!) and $10,000 from organizations that support rabble.ca.  We aim to raise the remaining $5,000 through this Indiegogo campaign. <br/></p>
<p>The money raised goes to pay Karl to write pieces every week Parliament is in session (and even when they are prorogued which seems to happen a lot and during some breaks). This works out to about 10 months. If this campaign doesn't reach its goal we will still use all we get to support Karl and keep supporting him as long as we can (and keep fundraising). <br/></p>
<p>At rabble.ca we operate on a shoe-string budget and take the trust donors show us with their support very seriously. Each year we put out a comprehensive annual report on how we made and spent our funds to bring news to the world. <a href=""http://rabble.ca/about/annualreport"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">You can read our annual reports here</a>. <br/></p>
<p>Perks? You know it. We got the Karl on Parl fridge magnet. You can get an unpublished audio interview with Karl the politics of Parliament  a ""best of Karl"" book, an invite for an exclusive Google Hang-out with Karl, you can be our Parliamentary Correspondent for the day, or even have dinner with Karl.  <br/></p>

session coordinator for two horror writers conventions, one of which I 
was also a co-chair. So I've had some solid experience seeing how 
hosting events
operates from the inside. If we meet our goals, the funds 
will cover travel and event costs for two editors to be present and 
available to work with authors at the event, and will also cover the 
cost to rent a van to take 
authors on day trips into Estes Park. Stretch goals will go toward 
bringing in another editor to cover author edits and a possible 
end-of-event party. I'm not looking to line my pockets or make a profit 
from this venture, as this will be a 'working vacation' for 
myself, as many events like this have been for the last few years. I 
just want to put on a great event, with some talented authors, in a 
wonderful location...something that we'll all remember for years to 
come. I hope you find this idea as exciting as I do, and I truly hope 
you'll join us for this unique and haunting writing experience! <br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/341357/files/20140131124626-1.jpg?1391201186"" src="""" style=""""/></p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Group

<p>The tickets to the formal ball with dinner are available at a group discount of $149 per person and are not included with any package or offer. If interested in attending, please let your host know when registering, as tickets sell out very quickly. <br/></p>
<p><b><i><u>Cut off Date</u></i></b></p>
<p>The block of rooms will be held
until November 30, 2014<i>.  </i>Those rooms not reserved prior to this
date will be released for general sale. 
Reservations requests after this date will be taken on a space available
basis at the higher of the contract rate or rate available at that time.  Should such requests be accepted, such room
nights will be credited to your block for purposes of any calculation of
attrition.</p>
<p><b><i><u>Room Assignments</u></i></b></p>
<p>The reservation department will attempt to accommodate
specific requested room types, but cannot guarantee specific room types,
locations, or room numbers.  Requested
room types that are not included in the group block will be charged the
prevailing guestroom rate at the time the reservation is made.</p>
<p><b><i><u>Pre/Post Group Rates</u></i></b></p>
<p>The group rates will be honored on space available basis for
group attendees up to 3 days
before or after the group’s scheduled stay.</p>

</p>
<p><b><i><u>No Shows &amp; Early/Late Departures</u></i></b></p>

<p>If group attendees are to pay for their own rooms, tax and
incidentals AND are sharing rooms, the following must be considered:</p>
<p>The Stanley Hotel is unable to divide certain charges
(telephone calls, restaurant charges, incidentals, etc.).  It is the responsibility of the individual
whose name appears on the reservation folio to finalize all charges between the
occupants BEFORE check out.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the group leader or meeting
planner to inform all attendees of the above.</p>
<p><b><i><u>Package Delivery and Storage</u></i></b></p>
<p>All incoming boxes will incur a $5.00 per box handling
fee.  All outgoing boxes will incur a
$5.00 per box handling fee in addition to the shipping charges (if the hotel
incurs these shipping charges) and must be made via FedEx or UPS with

December 30th, 2014-January 3rd, 2015





My
 name is R.J. Cavender and I love working with horror writers. That's 
why I'm hosting this second writers retreat at the historic and haunted birthplace of Stephen King's The Shining, The Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado. If
 you want to join us, simply register by choosing a package, then we'll 
give you the details on how to receive the group rate at the hotel when 
you make your reservations. *Editing Packages and Event 
Registration does not include your hotel room or transportation fees. 
Hotel room rates are listed at the bottom of the page.* But if you register 
now, you have an entire year to make your travel plans. And your 
registration does include all our group discount perks, select editing 
packages, inclusion on any outings/trips over the weekend, and a 
guaranteed tour of Room 217. I'll be setting up daily critique 
groups and nightly dinners, giving those interested a chance to hang out
 with fellow authors. But these aren't mandatory, and if you'd just like
 time alone to write, you can do that too! We don't want to set a rigid 
schedule or any programming that would take away from your writing time,
 since this
 is a retreat and not a convention or conference. So no dealers room, and limited programming. Instead we're offering a unique 
experience with a great group of authors and publishing professionals, 
in a fantastic hotel with a history steeped in horror (fiction?) Each package includes different perks that 
should fit the need of all authors, whether you're looking for some 
feedback and a polishing of your work...or you're just needing a 
great place to write and get away. Let us host your once-in-a-lifetime 
writing escape, and we'll promise you a great time in a scenic and 
spooky locale. For the last few years I've served as the pitch 
session coordinator for two horror writers conventions, one of which I 
was also a co-chair. So I've had some solid experience seeing how 
hosting events
operates from the inside. If we meet our goals, the funds 
will cover travel and event costs for two editors to be present and 
available to work with authors at the event, and will also cover the 
cost to rent a van to take 
authors on day trips into Estes Park. Stretch goals will go toward 
bringing in another editor to cover author edits and a possible 
end-of-event party. I'm not looking to line my pockets or make a profit 
from this venture, as this will be a 'working vacation' for 
myself, as many events like this have been for the last few years. I 
just want to put on a great event, with some talented authors, in a 
wonderful location...something that we'll all remember for years to 
come. I hope you find this idea as exciting as I do, and I truly hope 
you'll join us for this unique and haunting writing experience! Group
 discount tickets will be available through the hotel for the Friday 
night Murder Mystery dinner at The Stanley Hotel and the annual
 Shining Ball on Saturday night, as well! Group rates are also available
 for ghost tours of the hotel. I'll also be looking into group discounts
 for tours of Estes Park and any other sort of savings that I can pass 
along to our guests. I just want our writers to have a chance to get 
some work done...but be ready for fun when the occasion arises, as well. Event registrations/packages are transferable, but non-refundable. If you're not entirely sure if you can make it, please don't

 register. Funds for this event will be spent as they come in, securing 
rooms, vehicles, and other event expenses. Cancellations will create 
problems, so commit to this now...don't flake out...and we'll see you 
then!Fees for cancellation with the hotel and every last detail to
 reserve rooms are listed below. Confirmation of perk/package redemption
 will be within 24-hours, with instructions on how to redeem your room 
discounts at The Stanley Hotel once you've registered. We hope to see you next December! Confirmed Authors Guest List == To Be Updated as Guests Register ==

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>""Shabbat Across Israel"" is a study about the significance of the Shabbat tradition in my life, and its importance to Judaism. At age eighteen, I had been through roughly 936 Friday night Shabbat dinners at my Grandparent's house--but on June 2, 2006 the chair at the head of the table was empty for the first time. The sudden passing of my invincible Grandfather showed me the importance of my family's weekly tradition, for in the midst of sorrow, observing the Sabbath held us together. </p>
<p> That realization got me thinking--when we examine the history of The Jewish People, we see a history filled with persecution. So how is it that after thousands of years we are still one of the major religions of the world? What is it that has kept us strong throughout the generations?</p>
<p> I believe the thread that holds us together is the Sabbath; I am embarking on a journey across Israel to explore the meaning of this tradition in all walks of Jewish life across the ethnic and socio-economic spectrum. The mission is to express the collective Jewish family through the observation and experience of Shabbat Across Israel.  Through my journey, I hope to help others discover the beauty of Shabbat, and gain an understanding of how connected we are as Jews.  Whether you’re in New York or Israel on a Friday night…it is Shabbos, and Jews all over the world are united for twenty-four hours, not only with each other—but with their past, as well as their future. This research will not only benefit the Jewish people, but it will show all people the threads that have kept the Jewish Family together generation after generation. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I would like to offer you the opportunity to be a part of something that may play a phenomenal role in the Jewish Future. A financial sponsorship would enable me to conduct my research across Israel for the next year. For you, it would mean participating in something that will help the next generation of Jewish leaders reconnect to their roots.  I want to give the gift of Shabbat to Jewish students, and help them rekindle a love for our traditions. My research is the key to understanding the common thread that links Jews of all backgrounds, all over the world.  It connects us to each other, to our past, and most importantly--to our future. </p>
<p>I am hoping to raise $10,000 to aide in my tuition! I need your help!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Throughout the year, I will maintain a written blog and video blog in order to establish an audience. As a young woman, I can offer a fresh perspective on the significance of this powerful tradition, and I can tell it in a way that is accessible to young adults. With the use of social media, my journey will be documented in many forms and can further highlight the important role that our traditions play in Jewish life. I have several friends employed in Hillel programs around the U.S.A, who are excited to share the web content I produce with their students. I am also currently in the process of arranging several Shabbat Experiences with additional organizations such as Hillel and Birthright. I hope that by meeting with students I can gain a sense of what Shabbat means to them, and of how they connect to the collective Jewish family.</p>
<p> During my year in Israel, I will write a memoir detailing my journey and what I learn. My desired audience is the young adult group—my own generation—although I do not wish to limit myself, or the books potential to reach a wide age range. I feel that beginning a conversation on the importance of our traditions in today’s fast paced world is vital to maintaining the Jewish people’s place in it for today, and for future generations. I see a growing amount of teenagers, young adults, and even some grown adults rejecting their Jewishness--to them it seems archaic.</p>

<p>Even if you contribute as little as $1, you're helping. And there's a reward for that! Your name goes on a list of names for everyone who contributes in the back of the book, just for you! To read the book, it's $2 for an eBook edition, which you can order for the major eReaders, Nook and Kindle. Pretty awesome, right?<br/></p>
<p>If you donate $9 then you get a physical copy of the book, signed by me AND with a personal note, if you want one, (or if I feel whimsical that day!) and $20 will get you a signed poster AND a signed book.

</div><div>
<p>The point of this is not the money. I don't need the money. This is essentially a pre-sale for the book at discounted prices and poster bundles for some of you with space on your walls. </p> <ul> <li>This is set to $500 because it's the minimum that IG has. It would be incredible if we meet it, but it's not life or death.</li>
<li>This is all about me creating this book, you guys liking it, and being able to own it for cheaper than 75% of other books. </li>
<li>I just want people to like me. </li> <li>All funds will be used to produce and ship your orders, which is why there aren't any extra costs for shipping!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<div>The reason all the prices are so low is because I hate going to a store and seeing a medium-sized paperback book for $15-$20. It's not worth that much, guys. Stop it. My stuff is affordable and awesome. </div>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Timeline:</h3>
<div>The estimated delivery date is set to April to account for any challenges that I may encounter. I'm expecting the final edition to be done in the next 2 months with nonstop work, but accounting for shipping to me and then shipping to you and any incidents, I say April gives plenty of time. My plan is for you to get your stuff before then, and I'll update you all on all major events, so no need to worry!</div>

</div><div>See you, Space Cowboy.</div></div>","Who Is This Guy And What Is This?
My name is Stephen Leininger. I'm a writer living in Baltimore. I won't bore you with details of my upbringing. I mean, the important thing is that I wrote this book, right? Right?? 

20/40 is my debut novel. It tells the story of Derek Wilson, a 20-something who crashes funerals whenever he can. He searches for purpose in the lies he tells. But soon he meets new friends who he comes to like and grow close to. These friends are the best people he's ever known, and life seems okay again. But when Derek loses one of the things most important to him, ghosts begin to emerge from the past, threatening to rob him of everything he's come to love. 

You can read the first two chapters of 20/40 here:  https://www.wattpad.com/189624084-20-40-preview-chapter-1

 Here's How You Can Help:
Even if you contribute as little as $1, you're helping. And there's a reward for that! Your name goes on a list of names for everyone who contributes in the back of the book, just for you! To read the book, it's $2 for an eBook edition, which you can order for the major eReaders, Nook and Kindle. Pretty awesome, right?
If you donate $9 then you get a physical copy of the book, signed by me AND with a personal note, if you want one, (or if I feel whimsical that day!) and $20 will get you a signed poster AND a signed book. This campaign revolves entirely around you, affordable prices, and things that I can write my name on. 

Other Need To Know Stuff:

The point of this is not the money. I don't need the money. This is essentially a pre-sale for the book at discounted prices and poster bundles for some of you with space on your walls.   This is set to $500 because it's the minimum that IG has. It would be incredible if we meet it, but it's not life or death.
This is all about me creating this book, you guys liking it, and being able to own it for cheaper than 75% of other books. 
I just want people to like me.  All funds will be used to produce and ship your orders, which is why there aren't any extra costs for shipping!



The reason all the prices are so low is because I hate going to a store and seeing a medium-sized paperback book for $15-$20. It's not worth that much, guys. Stop it. My stuff is affordable and awesome. 

    Timeline:
The estimated delivery date is set to April to account for any challenges that I may encounter. I'm expecting the final edition to be done in the next 2 months with nonstop work, but accounting for shipping to me and then shipping to you and any incidents, I say April gives plenty of time. My plan is for you to get your stuff before then, and I'll update you all on all major events, so no need to worry!
    If You Can't Contribute:
Again, no worries! Even if you just share this page and get your friends to check it out, you are helping, and that's awesome! Make some noise for this thing, and we'll get this ball rolling together! 
So remember:  
Get the word out and start the chatter about this campaign!
 Use the Indiegogo share tools! (they told me to say that!)

You can also follow me on Instagram and on facebook. 
Thanks guys!
See you, Space Cowboy.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>I’m the founding and senior

the author of three published books. <a href=""http://kurtbubna.com/book-table/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">(Click here to see my books.)</a></p>
<p>Madeleine L’Engle once said,
“There is
nothing so secular that it cannot be sacred, and that is one of the deepest
messages of the Incarnation.” I believe this to be true, and it’s why I want to
publish a pumpkin story to add a “sacred voice” to the not-so-sacred holiday of
Halloween.</p>
<p>This fun and
illustrated kids' book will introduce children to a grumpy pumpkin named Pete.
Pete leaves his home, ends up in a dark and scary place, but then he is found
by kind Farmer Dale. It’s a story of restoration and forgiveness.</p>
<p>As you can
imagine, creating and publishing a full-sized (8.5 x 11), full-color children’s
book is not cheap. Here’s a breakdown of the total project cost of $2,500:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>$ 1,000 to pay the artist for ten color illustrations</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>$ 750 for media support and advertising</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>$ 500 for an initial run of books for distribution to potential
reviewers/endorsers</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>$ 250 for editing</p>
<p>I know this book will impact the lives of many
children! It’s time to put something fun, amazing and godly in the hands of
parents for Halloween. </p>
<p><b>So here’s how <i>you</i> can help:</b></p>
<p>·<span>  </span>Give a tax-deductible gift of as little as $15, and I'll send you a digital version (in a pdf format) of my book: <i>Perfectly Imperfect ~ A Devotional for Grace-Filled Living!</i></p>
<p>·<span>  </span>For a gift of at least $35, you will receive a free and signed copy of <i>Pete the Prodigal Pumpkin</i> when it releases.</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>For a gift of at least $75, you will receive a signed copy of <i>Pete the Prodigal Pumpkin </i>plus a free
and signed copy of one of Kurt’s three other books (your choice)! </p>
<p>If just 70 people give at
least $35 we will easily reach our publication goal. By the way, any funds received
in excess of our goal will remain in the <a href=""http://essentialifepress.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Essential Life Press</a> (ELP) accounts

<p>This is a Christian

<div> </div>
<div>Without giving away too many details, in my world vampires are another primate species that coevolved along side humanity. They have no fangs, they can eat normal food, walk in the sunlight, and generally act just like humans. They have raspers on their tongues similar to lampreys, that they can hide, and they do need to feed on blood. And they have another adaptation that they can use to navigate in the dark, cause amnesia in their victims and sometimes accidently induce incredibly vivid, horrific, monstrous hallicinations.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I am self-publishing this project and it will be a series. The first book is on target to be completed by the end of March and I already am fleshing out the story arc for book number two.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Your contribution will pay for:
<ul>
<li>Editing</li>
<li>Proofreading</li>
<li>Formatting for multiple ebook platforms (so it can be made aviailabe through Apple, Barnes &amp; Noble as well as Amazon) as well as print (paperback and hard cover)</li>
<li>Cover Design</li>
</ul>
Now, I'll grant you this project isn't high art or literature. it's just good old fashioned potbolier pulp fiction. Reading that's just for fun; something to pass the time on a summer's day or while waiting for a flight at the airport. It's not going to change the world. But it might make the time waiting for the Apocalypse a little less boring. But, all kidding aside, I do think that it's a neat twist on an old genre and by contributing you can be part of revitalizing it.</div>

<p>Meet Ryan Jackson, a small town kid and freshman at the University of Texas at Austin, and follow him on his journey through an extended vampiric adolescence in the capital city of Texas where ""keeping it weird"" is more than a motto, it's a way of life. When a classmate is assaulted during a mugging, Ryan turns vigilante, using his talents to find the perpetrator and bring him to justice but he finds out that things aren't always as simple they seem.</p>

I am self-publishing this project and it will be a series. The first book is on target to be completed by the end of March and I already am fleshing out the story arc for book number two.
 
Your contribution will pay for:

Editing
Proofreading
Formatting for multiple ebook platforms (so it can be made aviailabe through Apple, Barnes & Noble as well as Amazon) as well as print (paperback and hard cover)
Cover Design

Now, I'll grant you this project isn't high art or literature. it's just good old fashioned potbolier pulp fiction. Reading that's just for fun; something to pass the time on a summer's day or while waiting for a flight at the airport. It's not going to change the world. But it might make the time waiting for the Apocalypse a little less boring. But, all kidding aside, I do think that it's a neat twist on an old genre and by contributing you can be part of revitalizing it.

Here's a blurb about the first book:
Meet Ryan Jackson, a small town kid and freshman at the University of Texas at Austin, and follow him on his journey through an extended vampiric adolescence in the capital city of Texas where ""keeping it weird"" is more than a motto, it's a way of life. When a classmate is assaulted during a mugging, Ryan turns vigilante, using his talents to find the perpetrator and bring him to justice but he finds out that things aren't always as simple they seem.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Thank you for all the connections this summer-my heart is touched over and over-and the story-sharing on the blog and in emails and Facebook.

<p><strong>The Story:</strong></p>
<p>A backpacker falls face-flat in love with a charismatic carpet salesman while on holiday in Cappadocia, Turkey. Leigh doesn’t learn of Ahmet’s work as a freedom fighter until after their three-day Islamic wedding, but she copes with violence as readily as she learns to live without an oven or hot water.</p>
<p>Ahmet's missions mean that he is often absent, highlighting Leigh's comical and poignant struggles to learn the rules in her new life: never throw away old bread, don’t smoke during <em>Ramazan</em>, open the door no matter who knocks, save nothing for <span class=""aBn""><span class=""aQJ"">tomorrow</span></span>.</p>
<p>From the beginning, Leigh and Ahmet tell each other stories: he romanticizes revolution and she loves a fairy tale. After they meet a group of Kurdish refugees, they decide to formally write a book.</p>
<p>Together, with the reader as witness, Leigh and Ahmet use the place between truth and lies to create a suspenseful and compelling story. Ahmet details the workings of a guerrilla camp, Istanbul’s underground and a torture centre, while Leigh records her experiences with Turkish baths and toilets, cooking from scratch, family formalities and holidays.</p>
<p>While their joint-narrative blossoms, reality is not as kind, and they soon face some difficult decisions.</p>

<p><em>The Word Not Spoken</em> begins as a smart, lively introduction to Turkish custom, geography and human rights issues as threaded through a tender, carefully wrought love story. But that’s only the beginning. As the plot thickens, the story evolves into a sophisticated and satisfying double-layered narrative that poses questions about human action, intention, and the requirements for honest love. This is one impressive book, made stunning by the fact that it is a debut novel.  The people, places and conundrums of Turkey will lodge under your skin forever.</p>
<p> - Jean Lenihan, Los Angeles Times arts writer</p>
<p> <em>The Word Not Spoken</em> brought back much of what I observed during my stay in Turkey as a Kurdish refugee from Iran in the late 1980s: the wonders of Göreme, the breathtaking sites of Istanbul, the fear of the secret police throughout the country, and the hardship the Kurds had been enduring for decades.  Reading it I remembered, sighed and cried, but at the same time, I laughed, and above all, hoped that one day truth, justice and freedom may prevail in Turkey. </p>

Additionally, we've incurred debt to a few generous individuals whose patience is not infinite, and the infrastructure of the store itself needs some work: a bathroom in need of restoration, a broken lamp, a broken stereo, and new bookcases for this radical 50% expansion of our stock.I can already see that to the greater extent we can fulfill our customers' needs, the more books they will buy. Some fifty bestsellers fly off the shelves as soon as they are stocked, some surprising - W.H. Auden: Selected Poems? Middlemarch? - and some not so much - Lolita, On the Road, and the great novel that is our store's namesake, Malcolm Lowry's Under the Volcano.What can we say about our passion for literature? For something that is made strictly of words, it is hard to put into words. It explores worlds beyond our imagining, and calls us home. It is a body of the deepest truth, made of the wildest fabrications. It can be silly, pretentious, wrongheaded even as we marvel at its excellence, but without it many of us feel we are barred from our full humanity. It is magic, it is dreaming; it is the stuff of which our daily reality is made and shaped and sustained, and we had better use it wisely.If you don't know me, my name is Grant Cogswell, and I didn't just fall off the turnip truck. My efforts to build a monorail system for the city of Seattle and stop a highway tunnel megaproject along that city's waterfront met ultimately with defeat - but not without some monumental triumphs first. There is a book and movie about me: Grassroots, by Stephen Gyllenhaal. I have published a book of poems, The Dream of the Cold War, released by Publication Studio in Portland. But Under the Volcano Books is a living thing. We are open every day, and except for Tuesdays, I am here. You can view the store's website and our blog at www.underthevolcanobooks.com.Please help us reach our goal with a donation, and by sharing our video and project using Facebook, Twitter, email, and the Indiegogo share tools.Thank you for being part of this amazing dream.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Book</h3>
<p>Bold, bright, funny and original, <em>Monolith</em> is a work of science fiction like no other. Part dark comedy, part philosophical treatise, the story takes a look at the human condition and the limits of morality. </p>
<p>Set in the year 2137, <em>Monolith </em>follows the story of a recent college graduate named Travis Nguyen who has been commissioned to write a book, the first to be printed on paper in nearly 125 years. Nguyen chooses to write about a controversial topic - a curious series of events aboard a spaceship called the USCC <em>Meno </em>that the world government has kept under wraps for three years. What Travis finds while digging for the truth of what happened to the crew of the Meno is both humorous and horrifying. Chilling and unprecedented, Nguyen's discovery ultimately leads to a better understanding of what makes, and breaks, a man, and what ought to be done to make sure such misfortune is never had again.</p>
<p>A project three years, four drafts, and thousands of pages in the making, Austin Allen's science fiction epic <em>Monolith: or, the Greatest Joke the Universe Ever Told</em> is finally ready for publication! However, with how many copies are in demand, the price for designing and fitting the book's cover art, and with the rising cost of publication, progress forward is at a standstill. </p>
<p><strong>We Need Your Help!</strong></p>
<p>Here's where you come in. Each contributor who pledges $10 or more will score a copy of <em>Monolith</em> (eBook at $10, paperback at $25+). Once we reach the goal of $1500, cover design can enter its final stages and publication will start almost immediately. So, what can you do to help? Easy! Pledge two five dollar bills or more and score some cool rewards, or pass the word on to your friends and family. The more people who can get excited about this book, the sooner you can get your copy delivered to your door!</p>

How your contributions help
Every contribution will go towards the publishing, printing, and shipping of Monolith to readers worldwide. Once the goal of $1,500 is reached, final steps in post-production can finish, and publishing will start almost immediately!
A contribution for Monolith is not just a vote for Austin's book to get published - it's a pledge to help promote creative arts in Southeastern Idaho! SE Idaho is a region that is brimming with creative people and fantastic ideas, but rarely does the region get noticed for this. Help support Southeastern Idaho Sci-Fi with a contribution for Monolith!
 


Can't contribute money?
No worries! Your time and consideration are sometimes more than enough to keep this project going. If you can't contribute money, help to instead spread the word about Monolith! IndieGoGo is loaded with plenty of tools to share the news about Monolith and other indie projects on Facebook, Twitter, and more. So, if you can't give money, give a helping hand by telling others about the book! The more people who learn about Monolith, the sooner people get to read it!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>A SOURCE OF RICH STORY: THE PLACE I CALL HOME</h2>
<p>I love my neck of the woods and its endless source of rich story, image, and language.  This book is the first of several projects sprouted from the valleys, hills, and hollows I call home.</p>
<p>All money collected goes towards the publication of The Readyville Mill, a children’s picture book, written by me, Connie Foster, and illustrated by Carl Carbonell.</p>

<h2> </h2>
<h2>THE READYVILLE MILL -- IS IT FICTION OR A REAL PLACE?</h2>
<p>While this story is a work of fiction, the Readyville Mill is a real place. The original grist mill, built in 1812 by Charles Reedy, burned from some unknown cause during the American Civil War. The mill was rebuilt in the 1870s, which is the structure that stands today. Soon thereafter, the Readyville Mill generated some of the first electricity in Middle Tennessee. Tomm and Martha Brady purchased the mill in 2006 and began restoration. The mill is currently open for brunch on Saturdays.

<p> <img alt=""Readyville Mill"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/FMF1H.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>THE STORY SEED</h2>
<p>The Readyville Mill is about a young boy who wants two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>He wants to solve the mystery of electricity.</li>
<li>He wants his daddy to take the time to answer his questions for a change.</li>
</ol>
<p>The seed for this story comes from my own dad who was born in the Short Mountain community, but his father moved the family to Readyville when dad was five years old. While the mill was generating electricity at that time and while dad’s family was living in a rented house wired for electricity, they had to move back to Short Mountain without experiencing the luxury of electric lights. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>CAMPAIGN GOAL</h2>
<p>The goal of this campaign is to raise $2,000 to pay for illustrations, layout, publishing, marketing, and a webpage for the book.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Thank you for visiting this page. I hope you will consider joining us in this project. If you can’t help with a contribution at this time, it would be great if you could share this campaign on Facebook, Twitter, your other social networking sites, and by email.</h3>

<p>For the last three years, I have been studying the Beatitudes, the blessings that Jesus gave during the Sermon on the Mount. They can seem strange and even sappy to contemporary ears, or as small comforts to big problems. As I keep knocking and seeking and pressing in to understand them, I keep finding new and extraordinary dimensions of meaning and significance.</p>
<p>I have written about some of my reflections -- in fact, on each and every Beatitude, at the Huffington Post, where I am a frequent contributor. (See <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eric-simpson"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eric-simpson</a>)</p>
<p>I have also talked about them one by one on my professionally produced podcast, ""Seeking Peace"". (<a href=""http://ancientfaith.com/podcasts/seekingpeace"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://ancientfaith.com/podcasts/seekingpeace</a>)</p>
<p>Looking at the Beatitudes as a kind of ladder, an ascent, I have discovered some amazing things about spirituality and its fundamental relationship to the world. So I want to go more in depth and write a full-length book. The problem is that I have three kids, a low paying job, and lots of bills. I don't have the time, unless... </p>
<p><strong>You Help Fund My Project</strong></p>
<p>I work right now as a freelance copy writer online, anonymously providing content for various websites. It does not pay much. I make about .015 cents per 425 word article, which comes to about $6 an article. I have to write a lot of those to take care of business at home. Most of the stuff I write is about criminal law, car insurance, chiropractic and holistic health, psychology and self-improvement, as well as a variety of other subjects.</p>
<p>My studies on the Beatitudes have already given me a lot of material, I just need time to write and put it together. The funding would replace the money I make writing online content. It would cover bills and help feed us this summer. I would rather be writing and getting paid for something interesting that may stimulate thought and action than writing about car insurance and human growth hormone for $6 a pop.</p>
<p><strong>My Future Goals</strong></p>
<p>I am also a non-traditional student, having recently returned to school after a 15 year hiatus to pursue a degree in Psychology. I will transfer to Southern Oregon University In Ashland in September of this year. My aspirations are to make a positive difference in the lives of others. That's why I am choosing Psychology. I care deeply about people, about culture and the world we live in, more than I do about ideology or religion for its own sake. I want to redeem myself in the next half of my life (assuming I live an average lifespan) and make a difference in the lives of other people, particularly the disadvantaged. I think this book, along with my educational pursuits would be a great starting point.</p>
<p><strong>Why The Beatitudes?</strong></p>
<p>I see the Beatitudes as being revolutionary. They are antithetical to conventional wisdom or common sense in our present culture. I also don't think they are mere rhetoric, but apply to almost every area of life. Whether we are talking about poverty and our attitudes towards money in a capitalist society, or how we care for those who have less, or our relationship to the earth, to matter itself and to ecology.</p>
<p>The Beatitudes are together like a manual that instructs us on how to ""be peace"", not just be <em>at</em> peace, but become peace so that peace can spread, and that peace comes from being rooted both in the life of God and in the physical world. My desire isn't to proselytize, but to present my understanding of the text as it relates to spirituality and the world we live in. </p>
<p>My plan for the book is a very personal, reflective style, more like a memoir or an informal essay than a book of theology. The style will differ somewhat from the pieces I have published at the Huffington Post. My articles online are somewhat truncated just to get the basic points across. My plan for this book is write extremely well, conversationally and to make reading it a pleasure, not something that feels like a duty or obligation. I want to tell stories, not give homilies.</p>
<p><strong>What if I Don't Meet the Funding Goal?</strong></p>
<p>Any money will be used to write the book in lieu of writing SEO content. If I don't meet the goal, or only make $10, that money will be used for me to work on the book the amount of time it would take me to write $10 worth of chiropractic articles or car repair articles, or whatever. The book may take longer to complete, but anyone who funds it will reeieve their perks whether the funding goal is reached or not. Just later rather than sooner.</p>
<p><strong>Regular Updates</strong></p>
<p>If I am funded to write this book, I will initially submit it to a publisher who may be interested. If that does not pan out, I will publish it myself. Certain funding levels will recieve copies. Everyone who helps out will receive a special mention in the acknowledgements on the project website, where I hope to keep patrons updated on the book's progress, and even post sample segments as I write the book.</p>
<p>I know not everyone can contribute, but I am just asking fellow strugglers to send a small donation to get me started on this. I am very excited about the possibility of having the liberty to write about something that is very personal and important to me. And please do me a favor and spread the word!

YOUR HARD EARNED TAX DOLLARS and keep more money in your pocket. Want to know
how? <b>Read on…</b></p>

Canada (US version coming soon). This book goes beyond the basic importance of
a Canadian’s understanding that we simply pay too much tax. It dives into real
life situations and stories of HOW you can save tax, and how many top rated

going to show you the tax saving tips that the CRA does NOT want you to know.

leveraged a 400 Billion loan to lend to Canadians to maximize their RRSP
contributions, the Federal Government would receive no personal income tax
dollars and most likely go into receivership!  It is our right as Canadian
Citizens and taxpayers to pay the least amount of tax required. That is one
reason why our fore parents fought in war. We don’t want to bankrupt the

Answer these few questions to discover if this book might just help YOU!
1.  Are you sick and
tired of paying too much tax? 
2.  Are you looking for
ways to pay less tax? 
3.  Are you sick of the
way tax dollars are wasted on frivolous spending and greed? 
Did you answer YES to ANY of these questions? If you are human, I’m sure
you did! 
We have the solution! The ‘Tax Saving Bible | Ten Commandments of Tax Savings’ will give you real-life stories and examples of how you can SAVE MORE OF
YOUR HARD EARNED TAX DOLLARS and keep more money in your pocket. Want to know
how? Read on…
Why the name ‘Tax Saving BIBLE’?  A 'bible' is nothing more than an ‘authority
on a subject’. This particular ‘bible’ will be the authority on saving taxes in
Canada (US version coming soon). This book goes beyond the basic importance of
a Canadian’s understanding that we simply pay too much tax. It dives into real
life situations and stories of HOW you can save tax, and how many top rated
industry professionals advise THEIR clients on how to save tax also. We are
going to show you the tax saving tips that the CRA does NOT want you to know.
With the help of our industry experts, we will uncover top tax saving
strategies that can be used in your own life to save YOU ten's of thousands of tax dollars over your lifetime.

<h2>¿Por qué Emily?</h2>
<p>Aunque ahora trabajo como Consejera con niños y jóvenes, hace muchos años me desempeñé como Redactora de Textos.

Por desgracia, muchos de estos mensajes van dirigidos a la mujer con la intención de presionarnos para cumplir con unas expectativas falsas de felicidad, éxito y autorrealización. Qué mayor inspiración que esa para querer darle vida a un proyecto que transmitiera un mensaje diferente... de inclusión, aceptación y celebración de todo lo que significa ser mujer. Es una plataforma necesaria para dar a conocer lo que estamos haciendo, para inspirar a otras, para conectar y celebrar nuestras pasiones. </p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p><strong>Is InspireVision footage in the video for real? It seems too good to be true.</strong></p>
<p>This says a lot about our great programming team :) Yes, all the screen capture video sequences are showing the actual InspireVision-made magazine pages and presentations. People who have seen the live demos tell us that InspireVision is the best magazine/presentation engine in the world, with no-one else offering anything that is even remotely close to it.</p>
<p><strong>Where are the magazines and presentations actually stored?</strong></p>
<p>Everything you create is stored in the cloud. The physical location: super-fast dedicated servers in the data center in Kansas City, United States.</p>
<p><strong>Can I use my own domain for my InspireVision website?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Furthermore, you can easily customize the look-and-feel of the pages any way you want.</p>
<p><strong>Can I embed the InspireVision presentations into the pages of my existing website(s)?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. You do it the same way you'd embed a YouTube video, for example.</p>
<p><strong>Do readers have to download the magazine issue before reading it?</strong></p>
<p>No. Viewing the magazine issues is incredibly fast thanks to dedicated hosting, caching and the smart read-ahead feature.</p>
<p><strong>Do I have to create a different magazine/presentation version for each device?</strong></p>
<p>No. Different devices (iPad, smart phone, desktop monitor, laptop screen...) have different resolutions and aspect ratios, but InspireVision does an amazing job of auto-resizing the text, images, videos, animated effects, transitions and other elements, for the best match with the available device.</p>
<p>However, if you WANT to display different things on specific devices, you can. This is useful when you want to show something (a link, for example) that is specific for the given device (an iPad, for example). This is also useful when you want to reduce the amount of content you show on small devices such as smart-phones.</p>
<p><strong>I'd like to see how to use InspireVision to create an animated slide/page, not just bits and pieces...</strong></p>
<p>We hear you and here's the real-time video on how to create an into similar to the one we use for InspireVision videos.</p>
<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""360"" src=""//player.vimeo.com/video/108099624"" width=""640""></iframe></div>
<p><strong>Do I need to know HTML to change the look-and-feel of my InspireVision website?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely not! The entire InspireVision environment is designed so that you can do everything with the simple point-and-click, and drag-and drop.</p>
<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""360"" src=""//player.vimeo.com/video/108122130"" width=""640""></iframe></div>
<p><strong>I have a question, how can I reach you?</strong></p>
<p>Is it a question about InspireVision features and capabilities? 
  Please watch the videos on this page and read the FAQ first - they might already hold the answer. <br/></p><p>Want to share how InspireVision is going to impact your life or how you're going to inspire others?

It gave me confidence.It also had a big influence on me, leading me to the Fighting Fantasy books and to tabletop role playing games. I wanted to share this love from my childhood with my young nieces who were just starting to read. I looked but I couldn’t find a picture book in the format that was suited to such a young audience.So I decide to write and publish my own.I wanted to create a picture book that would give readers the same feeling of autonomy, adventure and uncertainty in a world rich with strong characters and stories that they could relate to. What a journey that decision has taken me on.Since then, I've started Zoot Publishing - an indie publishing house exploring new formats of printed books and games.Who Ate The Cake? is our first title and the first in the Who series aimed at introducing young readers to the interactive fiction (or game book) format, and to tabletop role playing games. VisionOur choices define us. At Zoot Publishing, we believe being curious and being aware of our choices makes us better people. We also love Choose Your Own Adventure  books and want to introduce today's young readers to the interactive fiction format. Who Ate The Cake?  is a 45-page hardback picture book for ages 4+ that combines both. The book encourages decision-making and curiosity in young readers by taking the reader on adventures in which they drive the story and solve the mystery. In the book, the reader is a main character and together with Sophie, sets out to find out what happened to Sophie's missing birthday cake. Along the way, the reader needs to decide where to explore, who to question, and more. There are 6 different endings in the book, all of which solve the mystery. So there is no right or wrong choice. Who Ate The Cake? doesn’t try to tell young readers what to decide, but rather lets them practise making their own decisions whilst enjoying the story. Understanding we always have a choice, even when there doesn't appear to be one, empowers us as individuals.  It helps us take responsibility for our actions. Combined with exploring, wondering and questioning, we can become people that go on to make a difference.Over the past 2 years, we've written, illustrated, done a trial print run and market tested the book. Now we need your help to officially launch.The money will go towards another print run and towards promoting the book and its values. Join us as we launch Who Ate The Cake? and help young readers grow curious and to remember 'There’s Always a Choice.'  ReviewsMy kids are HOOKED! We haven't discovered all 6 endings yet and I don't think my kids will go to sleep until we do - they're still up and begging me to read it one more time! ~ My Little Bookcase The illustrations are entertaining, colourful and the facial expressions are funny. This book is fun, full of adventure and a little bit way out.  ~ Melinda Noughton, Creative Kids Tales Perks One for you, One for a friend   (Featured Perk - $40 USD)  2 signed hardback copies of Who Ate The Cake?  PLUS the colouring in book of the illustrations in the book (pdf) and an activities booklet with questions and activities for before, during and after reading  (pdf). Colouring In Book   ($3 USD)Containing all 45 illustrations from the book. Colour in the illustrations and use them to write your own story or ending.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""><i>Infinitely More</i> is a nonfiction book about why senior women leave big jobs and how leaders lose them.</span></p>
<p>Did you ever wonder why high-powered career women walk away from big jobs and a hefty paycheck? This is a story of a reckoning I didn’t see coming. A journey that forced me to look at my career in Big Law, the impossible choices women like me make to succeed in these pressure cooker jobs, and the catalysts that cause us to leave - and relaunch on our own terms with no regrets.<br/><br/>My name is Amy Conway-Hatcher. I am the author of <i>Infinitely More</i>. I wrote this memoir to offer inspiration that women can take their power back and pivot at any stage of their careers. Many women are exhausted from “doing it all” in spite of significant barriers and lack of support. Playing fields still aren’t level. The gender pay gap is real. Career moms operate at inhuman superhero levels that aren’t sustainable. Even the strongest of women who seem invincible must eventually face tough realities that working around-the-clock and juggling interminable balls in the air doesn’t work long-term. We face hard questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do we wait for leaders to wake up and drive change or do we take the reins and lead ourselves?</li>
<li>Do we continue to sacrifice for a system that doesn’t offer equal support or do we pivot?</li>
<li>Do we really have a seat at that elusive table or do we build our own?</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>After many years of working 24/7 and having the same old conversations among leaders in my industry, I was lost and burned out. Even “Grit” went on strike saying I was nuts to keep beating my head against that same wall. It wasn’t easy. This tough girl was terrified. Yet, with the vision of some pretty amazing leaders and unexpected heroes (among them being my kids), I mustered the courage to take the reins. I changed direction. You can too.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you see the power of getting back to basics, reconnecting with purpose, and owning your career and your life. Change is not only possible (and scary), it’s invigorating. It is the light on the horizon, the road less traveled, the voice in your head. It is the opportunity flying right next to you... waiting to be seized.<br/><br/>Although this is my story, I know I am not alone in my experiences. This book includes hard lessons and reflections that I hope will open the eyes of leaders to better understand and fix inequities in workplace experiences. It’s not just about upward mobility, but sustainability of the climb. Women are stronger when we are allies and champions for each other. Leaders need a wake-up call. Talk without solid action, ownership, and accountability just doesn’t work. It never has. You’ll learn some examples why there aren’t more women at the table.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about coming to terms with where you are in this moment, celebrations and regrets, reconnecting with purpose, and opening your mind to new possibilities. Here are just a few stories you'll hear about challenges, inequities, and catalyst moments working moms like me face - every day....</p>
<ul>
<li>My life in Big Law was like a precarious high-wire juggling act in the middle of rush hour traffic while trying to avoid being shot at. I am the kind of high-powered lawyer you hire when you are in really big trouble. I’m also a wife and the mom of two amazing kids who bring me both joy and madness. Both jobs are 24/7. You never know what the day will bring..What does that look like, you ask? It was a chilly morning in early 2014. After seven months of commuting to Europe, the team and I were preparing a big presentation. It was “all hands on deck.” My husband left for work early. My young daughter, Olivia, woke up with a stomach ache that quickly turned into a scene from The Exorcist. Although my clothes were covered in God knows what, I still remember stepping between the shoes of “mom-of-sick kid” and “bad-ass warrior lawyer.” Then, out of nowhere, our au pair, followed by the painter, appeared in the doorway just as the pediatrician was calling. In a split second, the universe shifted. The pediatrician told me to get Olivia to the hospital. The au pair needed an emergency root canal. Our painter wanted to give me a “head’s up” that our hallway ceiling had caved in. I texted my team and the client, and put on my superhero mom cape. Handing out credit cards like candy, I remember calling in the cavalry, securing a school pickup for young Jack, and driving to the emergency room whispering to myself over and over: “It’s just another day. You can do it. Balls in the air…”<br/> </li>
<li>Olivia was about a month old and finally napping. Feeling grateful for any quiet time, I jumped when my phone rang unexpectedly. On the line was a very successful, senior male partner in leadership. He wanted to share the news that I’d made it to Big Law equity partner, something he didn’t think had ever been achieved by a woman on maternity leave. He congratulated me and welcomed me to “the club.” Before hanging up, he said with a good-natured laugh, “Welcome to the top of one greasy pole and the bottom of another. You still have a ways to go. Hold on tight.” Then, he was gone - literally and figuratively. Staring at the phone, I thought, “Thank you but, WTF? A greasy pole?!” All those brutal years of working crazy hours, having no limits or balance, and I was at the bottom of a greasy pole? I hated the analogy and found myself wishing for a ladder. The visual wasn’t inspiring to a gal who likes nice clothes and heels. Perhaps well-intentioned, his message made clear that I wasn’t part of the “real club” and the uncertain climb would continue. It would be slippery, dirty and hard. Worse, you could never let go with either hand if you hoped to make it to “the top” (whatever that was). That visual has never left me.<br/> </li>
<li>Years into private practice, I was having cocktails with some male alumni from my prosecutor days. The “banter factor” was high. The guys were talking law firm business referrals and salaries. I’m not usually one to be at a loss for words, but I sat in stunned silence. My salary was roughly half what they were making! Not only didn’t I have a seat at the table, I was clearly paying for the chair some guy was sitting in. After a period of preparation and nursing my wounded ego, I went to speak with someone in Big Law leadership. At a fancy restaurant, he shared that my hard work was highly valued and would pay off down the road. He agreed I was paid under-market. “It must seem unfair,” he said. Then, he shared the law firm had to make choices. My lower salary helped the law firm pay higher salaries to more senior lawyers, even if they weren’t producing the same hours or revenue. “Be patient,” he said, “You’ll get there by fifty.” I tried to keep my jaw from hitting the salad plate. At the pace I was working, I could be dead by then. I wondered if he would have said the same thing to a guy. I left the job and more than doubled my salary in a year. The scary thing? For business and culture reasons, I didn’t even take the highest offer.<br/> </li>
<li>Fast forward to 2020. I met leadership expert and best-selling author Gary Heil. Who knows why he took my calls or what he found so amusing about our debates. What could I possibly have to offer someone of his caliber, I wondered? Turns out I was a worthy adversary, he seemed to enjoy our sparring, and he became my provocateur. In fact, he was the first person to call me on my shit (or at least the first I was willing to listen to). While I wanted to challenge him on the failures of the leadership training industry, he pointed out flaws in my arguments on culture and Big Law. Gary pushed me to think bigger and beyond my comfort zone. In the end, he was right to push back. I couldn’t criticize others for their failure to lead if I wasn’t willing to lead myself. You’ll learn that meeting Gary, among others, was pivotal to my journey, my reckoning, and the direction I took when I reached a crossroads. He seemed to know where I was going before I did. He helped me realize I wasn't alone. And, for that, I'm eternally grateful. </li>

In the weeks and months that follow, she must examine how she arrived at this place, how to survive, and how she will move beyond. Slowly, she musters the courage to tap back into the grit, resourcefulness and resilience she has known for so long.

<li>To overcoming the deeply engrained fear of the unknown<br/> </li>
<li>To moments of reckoning and redemption<br/> </li>
<li>To a vision for the future that is brighter, full of possibility and closely aligned with purpose – and family</li>
</ul>

<h2>About the Author</h2>
<p>Amy Conway-Hatcher is a Partner with Schertler Onorato Mead &amp; Sears, a boutique law firm in Washington, D.C. whose team of prominent lawyers handle a wide range of high-profile complex legal, business and reputational matters. Amy is the kind of lawyer who solves hard problems (the kind people don’t want you to know about like bribery, fraud and harassment) and keeps your name out of the media headlines. She is the first woman Special Counsel for the Commission on Judicial Disabilities &amp; Tenure in Washington, D.C. and serves as a director on the Board of the Women’s Bar Association Foundation.<br/><br/>Amy wrote this book to take charge of her life and career, and to hold herself accountable for supporting her peers and the next generation of women leaders. Another “secret” reason for finishing her book is to avoid being called a hypocrite by her two kids and darling husband who lovingly remind her of her own sage advice to “embrace change,” ""overcome fear,"" “find opportunity in the unknown,” and “take risks.” She’s finally taking her own medicine.<br/><br/>Amy is a recovering 24/7 work-a-holic equity partner in Big Law who now finds time to be the mom she always wanted to be - cheering her kids on in volleyball and chasing them to get off electronics to play with her or to tackle their chores and homework. After all, they convinced her to pivot and spend more time with them! She is a founding member of Chief in Washington, D.C., an elite private membership network dedicated to connecting and supporting executive women. As a member of a number of professional and charity organizations, she is making up for lost time to help women rise, achieve career goals, and thrive in pivots. She's passing on and living the advice a wise woman shared, “Be a voice not an echo.”  <br/><br/>Last, but not least, Amy is developing some hobbies, something she was never able to say with a straight face - until now.</p>

</ul> <h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies are expected to ship.<br/> <h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>Not everyone can support, but that doesn't mean you can't get something out of it!<br/><br/>I will reward the top 3 people who refer the most backers at the end of the campaign (30 days). Here's how:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the top of the campaign page, you will see the ""share"" buttons. Click on the ""chain"" icon to get a custom link just for you. (Note: don't use the URL in the browser window as it won't work to track referrals and you won't get credit ?)<br/> </li>
<li>Copy that link and paste it on your social media, email it to a friend, or text a fellow book lover.<br/> </li>
<li>When someone clicks on that link and backs the book, you get 1 entry!</li>

</div></div>","Story of My Book
Infinitely More is a nonfiction book about why senior women leave big jobs and how leaders lose them.
Did you ever wonder why high-powered career women walk away from big jobs and a hefty paycheck? This is a story of a reckoning I didn’t see coming. A journey that forced me to look at my career in Big Law, the impossible choices women like me make to succeed in these pressure cooker jobs, and the catalysts that cause us to leave - and relaunch on our own terms with no regrets.My name is Amy Conway-Hatcher. I am the author of Infinitely More. I wrote this memoir to offer inspiration that women can take their power back and pivot at any stage of their careers. Many women are exhausted from “doing it all” in spite of significant barriers and lack of support. Playing fields still aren’t level. The gender pay gap is real. Career moms operate at inhuman superhero levels that aren’t sustainable. Even the strongest of women who seem invincible must eventually face tough realities that working around-the-clock and juggling interminable balls in the air doesn’t work long-term. We face hard questions.

Do we wait for leaders to wake up and drive change or do we take the reins and lead ourselves?
Do we continue to sacrifice for a system that doesn’t offer equal support or do we pivot?
Do we really have a seat at that elusive table or do we build our own?

After many years of working 24/7 and having the same old conversations among leaders in my industry, I was lost and burned out. Even “Grit” went on strike saying I was nuts to keep beating my head against that same wall. It wasn’t easy. This tough girl was terrified. Yet, with the vision of some pretty amazing leaders and unexpected heroes (among them being my kids), I mustered the courage to take the reins. I changed direction. You can too.My hope is that, in reading this book, you see the power of getting back to basics, reconnecting with purpose, and owning your career and your life. Change is not only possible (and scary), it’s invigorating. It is the light on the horizon, the road less traveled, the voice in your head. It is the opportunity flying right next to you... waiting to be seized.Although this is my story, I know I am not alone in my experiences. This book includes hard lessons and reflections that I hope will open the eyes of leaders to better understand and fix inequities in workplace experiences. It’s not just about upward mobility, but sustainability of the climb. Women are stronger when we are allies and champions for each other. Leaders need a wake-up call. Talk without solid action, ownership, and accountability just doesn’t work. It never has. You’ll learn some examples why there aren’t more women at the table.In this book, you'll learn about coming to terms with where you are in this moment, celebrations and regrets, reconnecting with purpose, and opening your mind to new possibilities. Here are just a few stories you'll hear about challenges, inequities, and catalyst moments working moms like me face - every day....

My life in Big Law was like a precarious high-wire juggling act in the middle of rush hour traffic while trying to avoid being shot at. I am the kind of high-powered lawyer you hire when you are in really big trouble. I’m also a wife and the mom of two amazing kids who bring me both joy and madness. Both jobs are 24/7. You never know what the day will bring..What does that look like, you ask? It was a chilly morning in early 2014. After seven months of commuting to Europe, the team and I were preparing a big presentation. It was “all hands on deck.” My husband left for work early. My young daughter, Olivia, woke up with a stomach ache that quickly turned into a scene from The Exorcist. Although my clothes were covered in God knows what, I still remember stepping between the shoes of “mom-of-sick kid” and “bad-ass warrior lawyer.” Then, out of nowhere, our au pair, followed by the painter, appeared in the doorway just as the pediatrician was calling. In a split second, the universe shifted. The pediatrician told me to get Olivia to the hospital. The au pair needed an emergency root canal. Our painter wanted to give me a “head’s up” that our hallway ceiling had caved in. I texted my team and the client, and put on my superhero mom cape. Handing out credit cards like candy, I remember calling in the cavalry, securing a school pickup for young Jack, and driving to the emergency room whispering to myself over and over: “It’s just another day. You can do it. Balls in the air…” 
Olivia was about a month old and finally napping. Feeling grateful for any quiet time, I jumped when my phone rang unexpectedly. On the line was a very successful, senior male partner in leadership. He wanted to share the news that I’d made it to Big Law equity partner, something he didn’t think had ever been achieved by a woman on maternity leave. He congratulated me and welcomed me to “the club.” Before hanging up, he said with a good-natured laugh, “Welcome to the top of one greasy pole and the bottom of another. You still have a ways to go. Hold on tight.” Then, he was gone - literally and figuratively. Staring at the phone, I thought, “Thank you but, WTF? A greasy pole?!” All those brutal years of working crazy hours, having no limits or balance, and I was at the bottom of a greasy pole? I hated the analogy and found myself wishing for a ladder. The visual wasn’t inspiring to a gal who likes nice clothes and heels. Perhaps well-intentioned, his message made clear that I wasn’t part of the “real club” and the uncertain climb would continue. It would be slippery, dirty and hard. Worse, you could never let go with either hand if you hoped to make it to “the top” (whatever that was). That visual has never left me. 
Years into private practice, I was having cocktails with some male alumni from my prosecutor days. The “banter factor” was high. The guys were talking law firm business referrals and salaries. I’m not usually one to be at a loss for words, but I sat in stunned silence. My salary was roughly half what they were making! Not only didn’t I have a seat at the table, I was clearly paying for the chair some guy was sitting in. After a period of preparation and nursing my wounded ego, I went to speak with someone in Big Law leadership. At a fancy restaurant, he shared that my hard work was highly valued and would pay off down the road. He agreed I was paid under-market. “It must seem unfair,” he said. Then, he shared the law firm had to make choices. My lower salary helped the law firm pay higher salaries to more senior lawyers, even if they weren’t producing the same hours or revenue. “Be patient,” he said, “You’ll get there by fifty.” I tried to keep my jaw from hitting the salad plate. At the pace I was working, I could be dead by then. I wondered if he would have said the same thing to a guy. I left the job and more than doubled my salary in a year. The scary thing? For business and culture reasons, I didn’t even take the highest offer. 
Fast forward to 2020. I met leadership expert and best-selling author Gary Heil. Who knows why he took my calls or what he found so amusing about our debates. What could I possibly have to offer someone of his caliber, I wondered? Turns out I was a worthy adversary, he seemed to enjoy our sparring, and he became my provocateur. In fact, he was the first person to call me on my shit (or at least the first I was willing to listen to). While I wanted to challenge him on the failures of the leadership training industry, he pointed out flaws in my arguments on culture and Big Law. Gary pushed me to think bigger and beyond my comfort zone. In the end, he was right to push back. I couldn’t criticize others for their failure to lead if I wasn’t willing to lead myself. You’ll learn that meeting Gary, among others, was pivotal to my journey, my reckoning, and the direction I took when I reached a crossroads. He seemed to know where I was going before I did. He helped me realize I wasn't alone. And, for that, I'm eternally grateful. 

You will love this book if you: 
Love honest, candid, challenging stories told with grit, heart, and humor 
Are juggling career and motherhood in a non-stop, chaotic world that doesn’t seem to get it 
Are grappling with workplace inequities and wondering if you are alone 
Are considering a career pivot and questioning whether you have the ability to pull it off 
Wonder why businesses lose women leaders and what they are doing wrong 
Wonder what our amazing kids think of our crazy working mom juggling acts


The Book - Infinitely More
Infinitely More is written in several parts. 
You will enter the wild and crazy world of a warrior working mom who moves between battlefields and playgrounds, courtrooms and classrooms, prosecutors and playdates, international air travel and carpool, memos and finger-painting. Believing she is impenetrable, she doesn’t see the ultimate burnout coming – until it does and hits her like a Mack truck. In the weeks and months that follow, she must examine how she arrived at this place, how to survive, and how she will move beyond. Slowly, she musters the courage to tap back into the grit, resourcefulness and resilience she has known for so long. She must overcome fear, rediscover her purpose and explore if another world is possible. With the help of unexpected heroes and leaders, she begins to see opportunity and limitless potential in the unknown. She faces hard lessons. She finds silver linings. She finds another way.
This is a deep, humorous, and inspiring story of the redemption and relaunching of a high-powered rebel career mom whose kids and unexpected heroes won’t let her off the hook.This book looks at this voyage from many angles:

From reflections, to hard lessons, to time lost and silver linings that offer hope 
To overcoming the deeply engrained fear of the unknown 
To moments of reckoning and redemption 
To a vision for the future that is brighter, full of possibility and closely aligned with purpose – and family

I hope you find helpful tools to think about the career you want to build that allow you to fully embrace your life.Pivots are possible. You have more power than you think.

She is the first woman Special Counsel for the Commission on Judicial Disabilities & Tenure in Washington, D.C. and serves as a director on the Board of the Women’s Bar Association Foundation.Amy wrote this book to take charge of her life and career, and to hold herself accountable for supporting her peers and the next generation of women leaders. Another “secret” reason for finishing her book is to avoid being called a hypocrite by her two kids and darling husband who lovingly remind her of her own sage advice to “embrace change,” ""overcome fear,"" “find opportunity in the unknown,” and “take risks.” She’s finally taking her own medicine.Amy is a recovering 24/7 work-a-holic equity partner in Big Law who now finds time to be the mom she always wanted to be - cheering her kids on in volleyball and chasing them to get off electronics to play with her or to tackle their chores and homework. After all, they convinced her to pivot and spend more time with them! She is a founding member of Chief in Washington, D.C., an elite private membership network dedicated to connecting and supporting executive women. As a member of a number of professional and charity organizations, she is making up for lost time to help women rise, achieve career goals, and thrive in pivots. She's passing on and living the advice a wise woman shared, “Be a voice not an echo.”  Last, but not least, Amy is developing some hobbies, something she was never able to say with a straight face - until now.

 You will love this book if you love candid stories, intersectionality, and social justice.Evolutionary Rescue is a nonfiction book that speaks to women leaders, leaders of color, and creative leaders who want to look at leadership and organization development in a new way.  The Book - Evolutionary Rescue The book is written in 4 parts and explores the synchronicity between the self, the team, and the whole system.Part 1: The Micro and Macro Frames contains the introduction + chapters 1 and 2. You’ll understand how the interconnectedness of shifting global dynamics are signaling that it is time for our organizations to progress from a inequitable and exploitative dominant cultural mindset. You’ll also learn how navigating different cultural contexts promotes whole system awareness through my personal stories of intersectional identities as a woman of color, engineer, DJ, & global citizen.Part 2: Self Awareness contains chapters 3 and 4. You’ll read about my story of growth through crisis, and how I walked away from a dream job at a Fortune 100 Aerospace company to reclaim my power and creativity. You’ll also hear stories of leaders from tech and non-profit orgs who overcome inertia and empower individuals through cultivating creativity, resilience and responsiveness. Part 3: Team Connection contains chapters 5-8. You’ll read first hand stories from women in tech about systemic bias and how diverse and inclusive teams overcome that by creating relational cultures of belonging.

You’ll learn how intrapreneurs, entrepreneurs, and educators are shifting whole systems and orienting them towards the common good. You’ll learn how decentralized power structures promote equity and how leaders are operationalizing systems change using scenario futuring, technology nudges, and inclusive design. What I Need & What You'll GetThis book will be published with New Degree Press.

<p>Hi! I'm liz yerby and I have done lots of comics anthologies and art projects with my comics friends over the last five years. My favorite art is non-fiction comics! <strong>Non-fiction comics can be educational, experimental, and collaborative, and Dolly Pardon does all of that. </strong>In 52 black and white comics pages, the book covers a quick overview of key points of Dolly Parton's life, but also gets into facts about rides at Dollywood, lesser known Dolly Parton songs and movies, her role in cloning, her butterfly tattoos and her contributions to medical research for the COVID vaccine.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Based in Ypsilanti, Toronto, Brooklyn, Champaign-Urbana and whatever dimensional plane Horror Editor Angela is, The Cultural Gutter was founded in May, 2003 by writer, filmmaker and game designer Jim Munroe and comics critic and artist Guy Leshinski to provide thoughtful writing on disreputable art. Since then, we've had twelve editors in two countries and seven cities write on comics, genre cinema, filmi b-movies, tv, science fiction, fantasy, horror, romance and video games. And in all that time we paid our writers, both editors and Guest Stars. Then we lost our funding grant, but a small, rag-tag band of donors joined forces with the Gutter to keep us online and help us keep our commitment to paying writers for their work. Thus, the Gutterthon was born. And the Gutter has been sustained without ads, subscriptions or a paywall.</p>
<p>At the Gutter we like to think we offer something special and we're kind of proud of it. The Gutter features thoughtful, well-written articles on topics like:  Godzilla vs. MechaRealism; Janelle Monáe as the American cool; <i>Adventure Time</i> and endings; the Telugu James Bond of <i>James Bond 777</i>; <i>Hellraiser</i> and ""development hell""; mastering the art of losing; Duran Duran &amp; William S. Burroughs' Wild Boys; and letting something you love reboot. So please click ""Back It"" and keep the Gutter flowing with the writing you love. Even if you can only throw in a buck, we will thank you from the bottom of our hearts.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are asking for $1800 and it breaks down to $250/year/writer or about $20/article; $250/year for the Evil Overlord for publishing, promoting, finding new writers, day-to-day site management, making sure the perks are shipped out, and continuing work on <i>The Cultural Gutter Must Be Destroyed</i>, a collection of essays from the Gutter's current line-up. Approximately $400 will go towards website hosting, domain registration and backing up the site. The remaining funds will go toward printing and shipping perks, promotional materials, Indiegogo and Paypal fees, and paying guest writers.</p>
<p>In return, you get our undying and eternal thanks and your choice of some sweet perks. And, hopefully, some writing that entertains and interest you.</p>
<p><strong>Perks Include:</strong></p>

<p><strong><i>The Cultural Gutter Presents Secret Diagrams of Mantis Fist</i>!</strong> Long rumored and often denied, the Cultural Gutter's have been presented in this volume for the first time. In publishing these diagrams, we hope to reassure those who have claimed that we have been hiding martial arts secrets for our own benefit. Instead, this volume contains not only the recently discovered diagrams detailing stances of Mantis Fist kung fu, but places them in context with a brief historical overviews, film reviews and even the accusations of diagram skeptics in their own words. Featuring art by author/illustrator <a href=""https://idontlikemundays.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Evan Munday</a> and crazy talk by the Gutter's own Carol Borden. Designed by friend of the Gutter, Andrew Nahem.</p>

Based in Ypsilanti, Toronto, Brooklyn, Champaign-Urbana and whatever dimensional plane Horror Editor Angela is, The Cultural Gutter was founded in May, 2003 by writer, filmmaker and game designer Jim Munroe and comics critic and artist Guy Leshinski to provide thoughtful writing on disreputable art. Since then, we've had twelve editors in two countries and seven cities write on comics, genre cinema, filmi b-movies, tv, science fiction, fantasy, horror, romance and video games. And in all that time we paid our writers, both editors and Guest Stars. Then we lost our funding grant, but a small, rag-tag band of donors joined forces with the Gutter to keep us online and help us keep our commitment to paying writers for their work. Thus, the Gutterthon was born. And the Gutter has been sustained without ads, subscriptions or a paywall.
At the Gutter we like to think we offer something special and we're kind of proud of it. The Gutter features thoughtful, well-written articles on topics like:  Godzilla vs. MechaRealism; Janelle Monáe as the American cool; Adventure Time and endings; the Telugu James Bond of James Bond 777; Hellraiser and ""development hell""; mastering the art of losing; Duran Duran & William S. Burroughs' Wild Boys; and letting something you love reboot. So please click ""Back It"" and keep the Gutter flowing with the writing you love. Even if you can only throw in a buck, we will thank you from the bottom of our hearts.

What We Need & What You Get
We are asking for $1800 and it breaks down to $250/year/writer or about $20/article; $250/year for the Evil Overlord for publishing, promoting, finding new writers, day-to-day site management, making sure the perks are shipped out, and continuing work on The Cultural Gutter Must Be Destroyed, a collection of essays from the Gutter's current line-up. Approximately $400 will go towards website hosting, domain registration and backing up the site. The remaining funds will go toward printing and shipping perks, promotional materials, Indiegogo and Paypal fees, and paying guest writers.
In return, you get our undying and eternal thanks and your choice of some sweet perks. And, hopefully, some writing that entertains and interest you.

Featuring art by author/illustrator Evan Munday and crazy talk by the Gutter's own Carol Borden. Designed by friend of the Gutter, Andrew Nahem.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p><strong>K-Pop: The Odyssey</strong> is a fun, comprehensive look into K-Pop’s music, industry, and culture through the stories and insights from top experts and resources with a discussion of recent relevant themes. It will be balancing industry, academic, and fan perspectives to bring you a colorful array of viewpoints and topics.<br/><br/>My name is Wooseok Ki and I am the author of K-Pop: The Odyssey. I wrote this book because this is the most fascinating time to learn about <strong>K-Pop</strong> - it’s the biggest and most relevant it’s ever been on the global stage. K-Pop artists are making global headlines, social media platforms are filled with creative K-Pop content, fandoms are more diverse than ever before, and general public interest is growing exponentially. This isn’t an overnight sensation at all, but rather more of an <i><strong>odyssey</strong></i> - a long, eventful journey full of breakthroughs and setbacks. <br/><br/>Despite the myriad of K-Pop content today, there’s just simply not enough books out there! The existing books on K-Pop are either theory-driven, artist-specific, or outdated - so how and where should one look to get started and more knowledgeable about K-Pop as a whole phenomenon? As a fan myself, I wanted to create a comprehensive approach while opining on recent topics including Asian representation in Western media, fandoms’ collective social action, musical experimentation over the years, importance of online technology and community platforms, and more. As a Korean-American, I also hope to share my thoughts and experiences engaging with K-Pop in both South Korea and the US to provide a more balanced perspective on the global phenomenon.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll explore direct accounts and interesting discussions from a diverse panel of experts and resources that I've interviewed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>The Star - </strong>From K-pop idol to international star, how does the star bring inspirations to life? How are talents and visions manifested through the company-artist relationship?</li>
<li>
<strong>The Executive Producer</strong> - How is potential rookie talent developed into a full-fledged R&amp;B artist like DEAN?</li>
<li>
<strong>The Songwriter</strong> - How are hit K-Pop songs behind top acts like BTS and EXO made?</li>
<li>
<strong>The Business Executive</strong> - How were top K-Pop acts like BIGBANG and CL marketed to a global audience?</li>
<li>
<strong>The Content Creator</strong> - What drives K-Pop fans’ passion, and what content and platforms are the future?</li>
<li>
<strong>The Trainee</strong> - What goes on during the life of a trainee en route to debuting as a K-Pop idol?</li>
<li>
<strong>The Recruiter</strong> - How are K-Pop trainees recruited and managed at a major entertainment company?</li>
<li>
<strong>The Journalist</strong> - How is K-Pop to be portrayed to a general audience that is unfamiliar?</li>
<li>
<strong>The Academia</strong> - How should we approach K-Pop under larger themes of Westernization, fandoms, and history?</li>
<li>
<strong>The Fan</strong> - What role does the fan play in relation to the K-Pop artist, the global phenomenon, and the fandom communities?</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that K-Pop is much more than just ‘<i>popular music from South Korea’.</i> In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for K-Pop in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a gateway - the amount of K-Pop content today is endless, and all you need to do is explore. My book will help you learn, recognize, and engage with the most important topics surrounding K-Pop before and as you dive into the movement.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you’re curious about what exactly K-Pop is and didn’t know where to properly look, or are an experienced fan seeking detailed insights into the phenomenon as well as brain-teaser topics relevant to larger societal themes. If you love reading about music, technology, business strategies, or social issues, there will be something for you to enjoy in this book. <strong>Even if you have absolutely no idea what K-Pop is </strong>and are on the fence about buying this book,<strong> I guarantee I will provide you with either knowledge or leisure (or both!) in a fun-to-read manner by the end. </strong>I promise!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Book - K-Pop: The Odyssey</h2>
<p>The book is written in 4 Parts:<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains an exploration into the never-ending question “What is K-Pop?” as well as bigger themes in Globalization and Online Technology. It’ll be setting the main framework on how K-Pop is perceived and defined as well as how K-Pop “got here”. It will discuss the evolution of K-Pop’s global trajectory including Asian success via the Hallyu Wave, US debut projects, Gangnam Style, to BTS today. You’ll be thinking critically about the importance of social media and interconnectedness, as well as technological developments amidst the 2020 coronavirus pandemic.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> includes a deeper dive into how K-Pop is produced and exported worldwide. It explores the successful K-Pop idol system in greater detail while positing challenges that Korean society faces as a whole. Further, through a series of expert interviews, it will explore how music and talent are produced and promoted around the world.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> focuses exclusively on K-Pop’s fandom culture. It will be invoking academic resources and recent collective sociopolitical action to provide a detailed overview on the diversity, unity, and ubiquity of K-Pop fandoms. It will illustrate the importance of fandoms to the overall K-Pop phenomenon, as well as address increasing misconceptions due to the fandoms’ prominence.<br/><br/><strong>Part 4</strong> will conclude the book with a discussion of where K-Pop goes from here, in terms of the remaining milestones and challenges to overcome including Asian representation and portrayals in Western media, recent industry strategies, and domestic developments in South Korea.</p>

Story of My Book
K-Pop: The Odyssey is a fun, comprehensive look into K-Pop’s music, industry, and culture through the stories and insights from top experts and resources with a discussion of recent relevant themes. It will be balancing industry, academic, and fan perspectives to bring you a colorful array of viewpoints and topics.My name is Wooseok Ki and I am the author of K-Pop: The Odyssey. I wrote this book because this is the most fascinating time to learn about K-Pop - it’s the biggest and most relevant it’s ever been on the global stage. K-Pop artists are making global headlines, social media platforms are filled with creative K-Pop content, fandoms are more diverse than ever before, and general public interest is growing exponentially. This isn’t an overnight sensation at all, but rather more of an odyssey - a long, eventful journey full of breakthroughs and setbacks. Despite the myriad of K-Pop content today, there’s just simply not enough books out there! The existing books on K-Pop are either theory-driven, artist-specific, or outdated - so how and where should one look to get started and more knowledgeable about K-Pop as a whole phenomenon? As a fan myself, I wanted to create a comprehensive approach while opining on recent topics including Asian representation in Western media, fandoms’ collective social action, musical experimentation over the years, importance of online technology and community platforms, and more. As a Korean-American, I also hope to share my thoughts and experiences engaging with K-Pop in both South Korea and the US to provide a more balanced perspective on the global phenomenon.In this book, you'll explore direct accounts and interesting discussions from a diverse panel of experts and resources that I've interviewed:


The Star - From K-pop idol to international star, how does the star bring inspirations to life? How are talents and visions manifested through the company-artist relationship?

The Executive Producer - How is potential rookie talent developed into a full-fledged R&B artist like DEAN?

The Songwriter - How are hit K-Pop songs behind top acts like BTS and EXO made?

The Business Executive - How were top K-Pop acts like BIGBANG and CL marketed to a global audience?

The Content Creator - What drives K-Pop fans’ passion, and what content and platforms are the future?

The Trainee - What goes on during the life of a trainee en route to debuting as a K-Pop idol?

The Recruiter - How are K-Pop trainees recruited and managed at a major entertainment company?

The Journalist - How is K-Pop to be portrayed to a general audience that is unfamiliar?

The Academia - How should we approach K-Pop under larger themes of Westernization, fandoms, and history?

The Fan - What role does the fan play in relation to the K-Pop artist, the global phenomenon, and the fandom communities?

 
My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that K-Pop is much more than just ‘popular music from South Korea’. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for K-Pop in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a gateway - the amount of K-Pop content today is endless, and all you need to do is explore. My book will help you learn, recognize, and engage with the most important topics surrounding K-Pop before and as you dive into the movement.You will love this book if you’re curious about what exactly K-Pop is and didn’t know where to properly look, or are an experienced fan seeking detailed insights into the phenomenon as well as brain-teaser topics relevant to larger societal themes. If you love reading about music, technology, business strategies, or social issues, there will be something for you to enjoy in this book. Even if you have absolutely no idea what K-Pop is and are on the fence about buying this book, I guarantee I will provide you with either knowledge or leisure (or both!) in a fun-to-read manner by the end. I promise!
 
The Book - K-Pop: The Odyssey
The book is written in 4 Parts:Part 1 contains an exploration into the never-ending question “What is K-Pop?” as well as bigger themes in Globalization and Online Technology. It’ll be setting the main framework on how K-Pop is perceived and defined as well as how K-Pop “got here”. It will discuss the evolution of K-Pop’s global trajectory including Asian success via the Hallyu Wave, US debut projects, Gangnam Style, to BTS today. You’ll be thinking critically about the importance of social media and interconnectedness, as well as technological developments amidst the 2020 coronavirus pandemic.Part 2 includes a deeper dive into how K-Pop is produced and exported worldwide. It explores the successful K-Pop idol system in greater detail while positing challenges that Korean society faces as a whole. Further, through a series of expert interviews, it will explore how music and talent are produced and promoted around the world.Part 3 focuses exclusively on K-Pop’s fandom culture. It will be invoking academic resources and recent collective sociopolitical action to provide a detailed overview on the diversity, unity, and ubiquity of K-Pop fandoms. It will illustrate the importance of fandoms to the overall K-Pop phenomenon, as well as address increasing misconceptions due to the fandoms’ prominence.Part 4 will conclude the book with a discussion of where K-Pop goes from here, in terms of the remaining milestones and challenges to overcome including Asian representation and portrayals in Western media, recent industry strategies, and domestic developments in South Korea.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Near the end of 2017, I started working at a conservative megachurch. I had already deconstructed my doctrinal ties to evangelical Christianity, so I was definitely concerned that working there would be problematic for me. What I found was that basically everyone there was decent and well-intentioned. That wasn't a big surprise or anything, but it helped me realize that my problems weren't with the heart of Christianity, but rather, the structure of the Church. This led me to analyzing power structures at large, and I became acutely aware of how group dynamics bred in these systems - be it government, workplace, family, etc. - change how we interact with other people, often for the worse. In my frustration with this concept, I wrote songs. I noticed that these songs carried over a lot of similar themes, keys, and melodies. Then I noticed that characters and plot could be derived from these songs. So even though the album is not yet finished (and probably never will be), a grander story rose out of that process. That story is Ecclesia's Table - a character-driven novel that certainly borrows from the religious themes and metaphors of my upbringing, but is more concerned with the general notion of how we as people allow systems of injustice to persist. Come travel to another world with me in order to see ours more clearly.</p>
<p>The world is a wasteland. It always has been. Moshe, Amaru, and Reenu have never known anything other than the desert that raised them. When the rumor arises that something other than barren landscape could be out there, the three of them make haste for an abundant future. Upon arrival at this established society, the group quickly learns how and how not to get along amidst group dynamics and seemingly sinister mystery. The trials and social politics that Moshe, Amaru, and Reenu face teach them that some rules are useful and some are meant to be broken. Have a seat at Ecclesia’s Table.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Logistically, I don't see many challenges in making this project happen! The book and the rewards have all been finished, it's all a matter of printing and shipping once we reach our goal. Everything is set up and ready to go!</p>
<p>I acknowledge that the content itself is risky. There are somewhat controversial moments and ideas presented in this book, and I'm sure that many Christians will take this as an attack rather than constructive criticism. That makes finding the audience for this story difficult (as many literary agents have told me), so all funds acquired here will go into covering costs for production, the rewards, and making this story widely accessible!</p>

We have reached our initial goal!!! Thank you so much everyone! Every additional dollar is going straight to Asista to help other people like me get matched with their very own service dog.]There are no words to adequately express my gratitude at the outpouring of support I've had since the launch of this campaign. When I started this journey, I had no idea how many lives I would touch in trying to save mine. I've met some incredible people who have already helped change the way I see my future. I am moved to tears at the kindness demonstrated by everyone involved, including all who have donated, and everyone who has shared this story. This opportunity has been humbling, educational and the most moving experience I've been privileged to be a part of.  Asista Staff are talented, dedicated, caring and in need of as much help as possible! I'm going to continue the campaign till Christmas so we can keep the momentum going for Asista. There are many other people in my situation that Asista will be able to help... Please consider this and continue to spread the word and generosity! <><>I need your help getting a Service Dog for my PTSDMy name is Craig and I have been diagnosed with severe PTSD but can't afford the treatment that had been prescribed for me.The use of a Service Dog will help me manage my flashbacks & night terrors, allow me to function day by day by helping me manage my anxiety and the issues that have come about from that, helping me enter crowded public spaces without being hyper vigilant of my surroundings.I am a very proud individual. It pains me to have to admit it but I need help. I had a massive Pulmonary Embolism October 2012 that should have killed me. I had another PE this past Aug 2014 (not as severe as in 2012). Two years ago I was diagnosed with severe PTSD. I've been prescribed a Service Dog as a form of short/long term treatment. Since then I have found an organization that accepted me and matched me up with a 4 legged life saver named Joey. Joey is a 2 1/2 year old pure bred Black Lab who himself is a cancer survivor. Joey was a rescue and has the drive that makes him exactly what is needed to be a Service Dog. When he is not working he likes to relax by frolicking and playing in the snow.I have been on medical leave (with a huge cut in income) and financially don't have the funds for the change in ownership of Joey.

<p><b><u>Summary:</u></b></p>
<p>Our project is the production of a children’s book
entitled “ The Magical Love Garden "".</p>
<p>This book is a supportive tool for children in their journey
throughout childhood.  The book also serves parents in providing them with
a common language when talking to their children about feelings and emotions.</p>
<p>The purpose of the book is to teach children to recognize and
distinguish pleasant and unpleasant feelings inside of themselves and address
these feelings free of guilt or shame. We aim to show children that it is
acceptable to feel all feelings, to cry or be angry, while at the same time
knowing how to release these emotions without hurting others.  We use the
metaphor of a magical garden and elements in nature that correspond to how our
mind and emotions work.  The book emphasizes that the remedy for any
conflict or frustration is patience, forgiveness and love.</p>
<p> Although this is a children’s story, it gives people of
all ages something to think about.</p>
<p><b><u>About Us:</u></b></p>
<p>My name is Ohad  Amidor and for the past 10 years  I
have been engaged in psycho-therapeutic and spiritual work which has helped me
a great deal in understanding myself and helping others with their journey.
 My girlfriend, Alexis Kohn, holds degrees in art and social work and has
worked in the field with children.</p>
<p>We are both students of Sri Prem Baba, a humanitarian and
spiritual master teacher.  His teachings touch the innermost core of our
being and inspire us to share these messages and love with the world.</p>
<p>We strongly feel the importance of introducing from a young age
the concepts in our book.  The intention of this book is to help the new
generation know their true nature, which is selflessness and love.</p>

<p><b><u>Our Plan:</u></b></p>
<p>Our project has been set for 45 days, though we will be happy to

 Although this is a children’s story, it gives people of

About Us:

We are both students of Sri Prem Baba, a humanitarian and

We strongly feel the importance of introducing from a young age
the concepts in our book.  The intention of this book is to help the new
generation know their true nature, which is selflessness and love.



The Project So Far:
The book thus far has only been written in Hebrew. 
The beautiful illustrations, made by the talented Tara Joy, are

After four years of brow crinkling labor I have finally finished my first novel. I am elated to be done with this work and to be able to share it with the world. I believe there is merit to both the writing and how the subject matter is handled. But of course, I'm biased. Here is what the back of the book says. It's an excerpt and a short summary.</p><p></p><p>“I was awake when the sun rose, floating not on a bed of cotton and coils, but a bed of ecstasy, and in that moment I knew what the poets know and what the birds of dawn know: that the rising of the sun is a majestic and cosmic gesture, beyond what the human mind can possibly comprehend. I can tell you that it is futile to try. It only gets one all tangled up. But I suppose the mind is relentless like a little dog pulling on its bone, giving a guttural growl as you try to take the bone away, needing, just needing to hang on to some conceptual understanding. The sanctified reality of life itself exists like a humming ocean unknown, below the dense smoky layer of ordinary perception. Lovers and poets penetrate it at times.”  </p><p><br/></p><p></p><p>Mimi Rizner resides at a psychiatric hospital navigating relationships with colorful patients, villainous nurses, and her own mind, but all she wants is her freedom.

After four years of brow crinkling labor I have finally finished my first novel. I am elated to be done with this work and to be able to share it with the world. I believe there is merit to both the writing and how the subject matter is handled. But of course, I'm biased. Here is what the back of the book says. It's an excerpt and a short summary.“I was awake when the sun rose, floating not on a bed of cotton and coils, but a bed of ecstasy, and in that moment I knew what the poets know and what the birds of dawn know: that the rising of the sun is a majestic and cosmic gesture, beyond what the human mind can possibly comprehend. I can tell you that it is futile to try. It only gets one all tangled up. But I suppose the mind is relentless like a little dog pulling on its bone, giving a guttural growl as you try to take the bone away, needing, just needing to hang on to some conceptual understanding. The sanctified reality of life itself exists like a humming ocean unknown, below the dense smoky layer of ordinary perception. Lovers and poets penetrate it at times.”  Mimi Rizner resides at a psychiatric hospital navigating relationships with colorful patients, villainous nurses, and her own mind, but all she wants is her freedom. She recalls her childhood, living out of the family's camper van, Bertha, her turbulent youth, love found and lost and the precarious months just before being admitted to the hospital. The Sound of Birds is a story about the human mind, the cross-roads of the mystical and madness, belonging and healing.   If there is merit to this work...   I would like to see it be successful and reach people.

<h3>About the book</h3>
<p>My Skin Colour, My Media, and I is a response to the need for something that exposes children to skin color differences. I need it today, and I have spoken to several parents/caregivers who needed it 10 years ago, and am certain many will need it tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>Research:</strong> It is based on research, discussions with educators, parents, and NGOs working with children. And those who have  and the and benefit from their scholarship, decades of hard work</p>
<p><strong>Illustration: </strong>A big component to look forward to, are the illustrations, that are culturally-rooted and represent daily life in the most enchanting way possible. The book:</p>

<li>Makes children aware of how media affect them, and enable them to address their feelings.</li>
<li>Includes historical events erased by the mainstream, such as stories of historically marginalized social groups.</li>
<li>It includes different types of families: gender nonconforming, special ability, mixed-race/mixed-caste/inter-religion, and low-income families. Basically the range of families your child is surrounded by.</li>
<li><p>Helps them self-represent through a handful of media-making exercises.</p></li>

<p>The Colourism Definition Tote Bag is perfect for launching a riveting discussion, where ever you go.</p>
<p>Note: This is a fixed funding opportunity, if we don't reach our goal, you money will be returned within a week of the campaign's end date.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Sometimes, colourism is a feminist issue</h3>
<p>While colourism  goes well beyond being gender-specifics, in some ways, it feels like a feminist issue. Girls/women are more impacted due to the social pressure of conforming to beauty standards, in addition to the unforgiving marriage market, where light skin is the most important criterion. The graphic below shows how resources spent on fairness products can be redirected to more important things like literacy and education, especially for women.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/9iGCCITR2AY?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div> <ul>
<li>We will raise awareness</li>
<li>Conduct original research.</li>
<li>The book will be educational, and a resource for individuals, families, and communities alike.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have spoken and created media about colourism in India. I have been supported by important public institutions for my work. My own personal commitment, and discussions with people across demographics and ethnicities, makes me confident the time to do this is now.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>A possible challenge</h3>
<p>Culturally, we prefer not to talk about colourism, especially as a first, or second-hand experience. Because it's hard. For all of us. I think the reason for that is that those that are 'lights-skinned' may be uncomfortable acknowledging our light-skinned privilege, and those that are 'dark-skinned' have a hard time accepting our negative experiences. Here're some ways I am trying to circumvent it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asking site visitors to share and encourage open discussion.</li>
<li>Research, articles, FAQs are aimed at embracing the idea that colorism exists and reject the thought that ""it's just in the mind"" or 'it's okay because that's how it's always been.""</li>
<li>Bollywood-based memes to highlight their impact, and look at films with fresh eyes. And move on from saying that it's ""just shown in films"" or ""films are for entertainment.""</li>
<li>We have some subversive gifts / giveaways that help break the taboo around public discussion</li>
</ul>
<div>So please, fund us, get your goody bag, (or 2!) and make this campaign a success.</div>
<div> </div>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please help me spread the word about this very important, and timely book, as the political climate urges us to come just a little bit closer. Here’re some ways you can help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Like the The Colo(u)rism Project and share posts. </li>
<li>Encourage conversation. Listen. Share.</li>
<li>Follow us on Instagram and Tumblr and, again, encourage, listen, share</li>
<li>Connect us to journalists / bloggers.</li>
<li>Canvas your networks - relevant POC (people of color) groups. Send a group email, CC me (thecolourismproject@gmail.com).</li>
<li>Send the campaign link to scholars, art or media educators, media makers, feminists, advocates...</li>
<li>In short, make some noise about our campaign.</li>

Makes children aware of how media affect them, and enable them to address their feelings.
Includes historical events erased by the mainstream, such as stories of historically marginalized social groups.
It includes different types of families: gender nonconforming, special ability, mixed-race/mixed-caste/inter-religion, and low-income families. Basically the range of families your child is surrounded by.
Helps them self-represent through a handful of media-making exercises.

The ultimate goal of this book is to help children organize, frame, and articulate their thoughts and ideas independently.

The Perks: Limited-edition merchandise
Limited-edition merchandise for is designed to raise critical questions about colourism, using wit and design. If these can spark conversations when they're displyed in your house, or when you carry them around in public places, our goal for raising cultural awareness shall be fulfilled.
The vintage art superimposed with modern dialogue(below) are a commentary on the media’s culpability in promoting and sustaining colourism in our culture. This includes: limited-edition, 4x6 inch, glossy, 2-card set and a zip pouch to carry you skin care products on a day out.




The Colourism Definition Tote Bag is perfect for launching a riveting discussion, where ever you go.
Note: This is a fixed funding opportunity, if we don't reach our goal, you money will be returned within a week of the campaign's end date.

Sometimes, colourism is a feminist issue
While colourism  goes well beyond being gender-specifics, in some ways, it feels like a feminist issue. Girls/women are more impacted due to the social pressure of conforming to beauty standards, in addition to the unforgiving marriage market, where light skin is the most important criterion. The graphic below shows how resources spent on fairness products can be redirected to more important things like literacy and education, especially for women.
 
We will raise awareness
Conduct original research.
The book will be educational, and a resource for individuals, families, and communities alike.

I have spoken and created media about colourism in India. I have been supported by important public institutions for my work. My own personal commitment, and discussions with people across demographics and ethnicities, makes me confident the time to do this is now.

A possible challenge
Culturally, we prefer not to talk about colourism, especially as a first, or second-hand experience. Because it's hard. For all of us. I think the reason for that is that those that are 'lights-skinned' may be uncomfortable acknowledging our light-skinned privilege, and those that are 'dark-skinned' have a hard time accepting our negative experiences. Here're some ways I am trying to circumvent it:

Asking site visitors to share and encourage open discussion.
Research, articles, FAQs are aimed at embracing the idea that colorism exists and reject the thought that ""it's just in the mind"" or 'it's okay because that's how it's always been.""
Bollywood-based memes to highlight their impact, and look at films with fresh eyes. And move on from saying that it's ""just shown in films"" or ""films are for entertainment.""
We have some subversive gifts / giveaways that help break the taboo around public discussion

So please, fund us, get your goody bag, (or 2!) and make this campaign a success.
