We are a mix of 2nd and 3rd year students from The University of Bolton
studying Special Effects or Visual Effects for Film and Television.We
have been given a project in which we need to work together to create two futuristic military shots combining physical and Visual effects.
The physical effects team are going to create props such as bullets and guns. The makeup designs will include bruises, cuts and even robotic limbs.Below is a concept design idea showing some of the makeup effects including a robotic cheek piece and a robotic leg.

Sections of toy guns will be the base for our prop guns, they can then be adapted using materials such as wood and plasticard to change the size and shape. Once this is completed they can be sprayed and painted to complete the look.


The robotic limb will be a cast of
the actors arm which will then have panels which have been made to fit the arm
using professional quality materials.

The visual effects team are responsible for compositing the shots and creating computer generated images such as helicopters and other futurist machinery.
This is one of our main shots below showing all four characters of which we need to provide military costumes combined with the props and makeup which we will make ourselves all filmed on a green screen and composited together with the computer generated imagery.

</h3><h2><strong>Niki Reina-Guerra and Nicaragua</strong></h2>
<p>Niki Reina-Guerra is an amazing 5th grade teacher at Willett 
Elementary School in Davis, California.  She has nurtured and taught 
hundreds of our children in Davis.  And she is passionate about 
furthering the education of Nicaraguan kids, too.  A group of Niki's 
former students and their parents are raising funds to send Niki back to
 Nicaragua in summer of 2015 to help construct another school -- she 
will lay bricks, mix cement and build that school!  The funds raised 
help pay for the school including the rebar, wiring, plumbing, bricks 
and so on as well as Niki's housing and travel.  Please help by donating
 $5 or $10 or $500!  Many small donations make the goal light!  If you 
want to give Niki an end of the school year gift, please donate to her 
dream of helping to build another school.  If you cannot contribute 
money, that's ok!  We hope to send Niki with duffle bags full of new or 
gently used school backpacks and children's 
Spanish books.  And you can help at our
 garage sale - anything you can donate will help us raise funds. <br/></p>
What is Seeds of Learning?  Watch the video at <a href=""http://www.seedsoflearning.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.seedsoflearning.org</a>
 and you will understand Niki's love of this non-profit.  Seeds of 
Learning or ""SOL"" is a small but mighty non-profit whose sole mission is
 to further education in Nicaragua.  Since its inception in 1991, SOL 
has constructed or remodeled 152 classrooms in 55 communities in 
Nicaragua.   After a school is built, SOL matches the school in 
Nicaragua with a sister school in the United States.  Niki's 5th grade 
class at Willett Elementary is the sister school with Palo de Agua, a 
very small rural elementary school that Niki helped build in 2009.  You 
can see the video at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ekbVBx24GM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ekbVBx24GM</a>
 from the 2009 workgroup.  Niki's 5th grade students continue to write 
to the students at the Palo de Agua elementary school.  The strong bonds
 between our communities will be lifelong because of Niki.Short Summary </div></div>","Niki Reina-Guerra and Nicaragua

Spanish books.  And you can help at our
 garage sale - anything you can donate will help us raise funds. 
What is Seeds of Learning?  Watch the video at www.seedsoflearning.org
 and you will understand Niki's love of this non-profit.  Seeds of 
Learning or ""SOL"" is a small but mighty non-profit whose sole mission is
 to further education in Nicaragua.  Since its inception in 1991, SOL 
has constructed or remodeled 152 classrooms in 55 communities in 
Nicaragua.   After a school is built, SOL matches the school in 
Nicaragua with a sister school in the United States.  Niki's 5th grade 
class at Willett Elementary is the sister school with Palo de Agua, a 
very small rural elementary school that Niki helped build in 2009.  You 
can see the video at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ekbVBx24GM
 from the 2009 workgroup.  Niki's 5th grade students continue to write 
to the students at the Palo de Agua elementary school.  The strong bonds
 between our communities will be lifelong because of Niki.Short Summary",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>This is such a wonderful group of students from a diverse cross section of our community.  We are raising money for Block Cello Straps for the entire Golden Strings cello section.  While this may seem to benefit only the cello students, the entire orchestra will profit because we will be more easily able to take our group out into the community and share our music to a wider audience for years to come.  Check out the straps at cellostrap.com.</p>
<p>We have done some community outreach in the past – our most recent was a performance for the Alliance for Victims’ Rights awards ceremony.  We want to do more performances like this for our community.</p>
<p>Your contribution may be recognized in several ways, of your choosing.  Because we are a public school you will receive a letter signifying your tax deductible donation (provided we have your contact information.)  In addition, if you would like, we will include your name on our concert programs this year to thank you for your donation.</p>
<p>If we do not meet our entire goal, we will purchase as many Block Straps as we have funds for and allow the students to take turns using the straps.</p>

<p>The Bishop Anstey High School is AMAZING. Established in 1921 and nestled on the outskirts of downtown Port of Spain in Trinidad, it has honed strong, independent-thinking women who have made their mark in all walks of life – from politics to the performing arts. We are leaders, givers and hard workers. Our reputation as “Bishop’s girls” is known far and wide – don’t mess with us!</p>
<p>My name is Sonja, and I'm a proud Hilarian (= Bishop Anstey High School alumna).  I'm also a performer, producer and filmmaker. In commemoration of Bishop Anstey High School’s 100th Anniversary, which is a few short years away (2021), I’ve begun research and production for a film whose working title is ""Excellent Women: 100 Years of Bishop Anstey High School"".  This is to commemorate our centennial and what we have achieved as graduates of this stellar institution. The film is estimated at US$37,000 (TT$250,000), but at this point we need to get some of the older alumni on record, so we need to shoot these interviews as soon as possible. We’ve already interviewed Miss Shurland, a former (formidable) principal in her 90s and Miss Winifred Rose (an equally formidable student who celebrated her 98th birthday this year). We need some more of those voices, as well as the ones from more recent times! We also need the resources to source key photographs, documents and archival footage that will help us in the quest to make this film an incredible, permanent testament to the school that made us Excellent Women. So we’re asking you to help us raise US$15,000 initially, so we can continue this phase of the process as soon as possible. That will help us to conduct key interviews of the seniors, as well as to continue the research and documentation.</p>
<p>We hope you can help! If you're not in a position to send a monetary contribution, you can still help by sending photographs or clippings of key moments or people (including yourself) to bahsfilm100@gmail.com (300dpi preferred). Or you can send hardcopy information to P. O. Box 10322, St. James, Trinidad.  Please include a brief written explanation of what you are sending (including the year, the occasion and the people in the image, if applicable).</p>
<p>Even if you are not an alumna of the school, won’t you please support excellence and the achievements of women of this exceptional school in Trinidad?</p>

Get on board!</p><p>We are Tagma, the organization behind the construction of the very first sustainable public school in the continent, built in february 2016 in the uruguayan town named Jaureguiberry. Now, we want to build a sustainable school in each country of the region and our next challenge is to rise The Sustainable School Argentina, in the town of Mar Chiquita, in the southeast of Buenos Aires province.</p><p>We want to promote and implement a school model whose heart is a self-sustaining building that minimizes operating costs and facilitates significant learning about innovation and sustainability for the children who live there and for the community that surrounds it.</p><h3>The Building</h3><p>The 270 m2 building will be raised in just seven weeks, between March and April 2018 and will comply with the six core principles of the Earthship method developed by renowned architect Michael Reynolds, who will lead the construction with his team:</p><ol>
<li>Use of recycled materials on site (tires, plastic and glass bottles, cans and cardboard).</li>
<li>Rainwater harvesting for water supply</li>
<li>Renewable energies (photovoltaic panels)</li>
<li>Reuse of the water inside the building</li>
<li>Passive thermal conditioning (the temperature remains stable throughout the year without the need for artificial thermal sources)</li>
<li>Production of organic food in internal and external orchards</li>
</ol><p>More than 100 volunteers from all over the world will participate in the construction to learn the constructive method and at the same time they will participate in this unique experience.</p><p>They will work with the local community, the Earthship Biotecture and Tagma teams, to build the school in just 45 days.</p><h3> </h3><h3>The project</h3><p>The project A Sustainable School Argentina began in early 2017, when we identified the town of Mar Chiquita as the ideal place to receive this new school.</p><p>In town, we contacted three key actors for the project: the Amartya Civil Association, partners in the community and educational component of the project, the Municipality of Mar Chiquita, which provided us with institutional support and the community of the school N°12 who will receive the new building.</p><p>During this and next year, we will work together with Amartya on three levels: with the children of the school N°12 and the teachers, with their families and with the local community, in order to get them to appropriate the building and know how to make the most of their resources, both from a functional point of view and from a pedagogical, educational and social point of view.</p><p> </p><h3>Financing</h3><p>The project A Sustainable School Argentina has a budget that exceeds $ 400,000 and will be donated to the state. A large part of this funding comes from sponsors that we have obtained along our way, another part is contributed by work and logistical and material support of the Municipality of Mar Chiquita and the Tagma and Amartya teams. Another funding source is the realization of courses and workshops that allow us to share the knowledge generated in these experiences. In addition, we add this source of collective financing that will allow us to specifically ensure educational and community work throughout 2018, promoting the appropriation of the building by the community and the final success of the project.</p><p>For this last source of funding, we have thought a series of returns that go from local to virtual and that aim to spread the project and at the same time give our collaborators new knowledge.</p><p>The goal set by this campaign is directly associated with the work that our team will develop throughout 2018 to achieve the correct appropriation of the building by the community. This includes workshops, meetings, transfers, the development and supervision of an educational program and a community proposal that will make the new school an engine of change for those who inhabit it and a center of innovation for the people that surround it.

Ahora, queremos construir una escuela sustentable en cada país de la región y nuestro próximo desafío es levantar Una Escuela Sustentable Argentina, en la localidad de Mar Chiquita, al sureste de la provincia de Buenos Aires.Queremos impulsar e implementar un modelo de escuela cuyo corazón sea un edificio autosustentable que minimice costos operativos y facilite aprendizajes significativos sobre innovación y sustentabilidad para los niños y niñas que la habitan y para la comunidad que lo rodea.El edificioEl edificio de 270 m2 será levantado en tan sólo siete semanas, entre marzo y abril de 2018 y cumplirá con los seis principios centrales del método Earthship desarrollado por el reconocido arquitecto Michael Reynolds, quién liderará la construcción junto a su equipo:
Utilización de materiales reciclados en la obra (cubiertas, botellas de plástico y de vidrio, latas y cartón).
Recolección de agua de lluvia para abastecimiento
Energías renovables (paneles fotovoltaicos)
Reutilización de las aguas dentro del edificio
Acondicionamiento térmico pasivo (la temperatura se mantiene estable durante todo el año sin necesidad de fuentes artificiales térmicas)
Producción de alimentos orgánicos en huerta interna y externa
En la construcción participarán más de 100 voluntarios llegados de todo el mundo para aprender el método constructivo y al mismo tiempo participar de esta experiencia única. Ellos trabajarán con la comunidad local, el equipo de Earthship Biotecture y el de Tagma, para construir el edificio en apenas 45 días.El proyectoEl proyecto Una Escuela Sustentable Argentina comenzó a principios de 2017, cuando identificamos a la localidad de Mar Chiquita como el lugar ideal para recibir esta nueva escuela.En la localidad, entramos en contacto con tres actores claves para el proyecto: la Asociación Civil Amartya, socios en el componente educativo comunitario del proyecto, el Municipio de Mar Chiquita, que nos brindó su respaldo institucional y la comunidad escolar de la escuela N°12 que recibirá el nuevo edificio.Durante este año y el que viene, trabajaremos junto con Amartya en tres niveles: con los niños y niñas de la escuela N°12 y el equipo escolar, con sus familias y con la comunidad local, con el fin de lograr que se apropien del edificio y sepan aprovechar sus recursos al máximo, tanto desde el punto de vista funcional, como desde el punto de vista pedagógico, educativo y social.FinanciaciónEl proyecto Una Escuela Sustentable Argentina tiene un presupuesto que supera los 400.000 dólares y será donado totalmente al estado. Gran parte de esta financiación proviene de sponsors que hemos conseguido a lo largo de nuestro camino, otra parte, la aportan con trabajo y apoyo logístico y material el Municipio de Mar Chiquita y los equipos de Tagma y Amartya. Otra fuente de financiamiento es la realización de cursos y talleres que nos permiten compartir el conocimiento generado en estas experiencias. Y además, sumamos esta fuente de financiamiento colectivo que nos permitirá específicamente asegurar el trabajo educativo y comunitario durante todo el 2018 potenciando la apropiación del edificio por parte de la comunidad y el éxito final del proyecto.Para esta última fuente de financiamiento, hemos pensado una serie de retornos que van desde lo local a lo virtual y que apuntan a difundir el proyecto y al mismo tiempo dar a nuestros colaboradores nuevos conocimientos.La meta fijada por esta campaña esta directamente asociada al trabajo que nuestro equipo desarrollará durante todo el 2018 para lograr la correcta apropiación del edificio por parte de la comunidad. Esto incluye talleres, reuniones, traslados, el desarrollo y la supervisión de un programa educativo y una propuesta comunitaria que conviertan a la nueva escuela en un motor de cambio para quienes la habitan y un centro de innovación para el pueblo que la rodea. ¡Mientras más nos acerquemos a la meta, más tiempo podremos trabajar en este objetivo! English ¡We are going to build the first sustainable public school in Argentina! This school will be the perfect place for children to grow in direct contact with experiences of sustainability, protection of the environment, recycling and develop a sustainable relationship with the world that surrounds them, becoming an engine of change and bringing their knowledge to the entire community. Get on board!We are Tagma, the organization behind the construction of the very first sustainable public school in the continent, built in february 2016 in the uruguayan town named Jaureguiberry. Now, we want to build a sustainable school in each country of the region and our next challenge is to rise The Sustainable School Argentina, in the town of Mar Chiquita, in the southeast of Buenos Aires province.We want to promote and implement a school model whose heart is a self-sustaining building that minimizes operating costs and facilitates significant learning about innovation and sustainability for the children who live there and for the community that surrounds it.The BuildingThe 270 m2 building will be raised in just seven weeks, between March and April 2018 and will comply with the six core principles of the Earthship method developed by renowned architect Michael Reynolds, who will lead the construction with his team:
Use of recycled materials on site (tires, plastic and glass bottles, cans and cardboard).
Rainwater harvesting for water supply
Renewable energies (photovoltaic panels)
Reuse of the water inside the building
Passive thermal conditioning (the temperature remains stable throughout the year without the need for artificial thermal sources)
Production of organic food in internal and external orchards
More than 100 volunteers from all over the world will participate in the construction to learn the constructive method and at the same time they will participate in this unique experience.They will work with the local community, the Earthship Biotecture and Tagma teams, to build the school in just 45 days. The projectThe project A Sustainable School Argentina began in early 2017, when we identified the town of Mar Chiquita as the ideal place to receive this new school.In town, we contacted three key actors for the project: the Amartya Civil Association, partners in the community and educational component of the project, the Municipality of Mar Chiquita, which provided us with institutional support and the community of the school N°12 who will receive the new building.During this and next year, we will work together with Amartya on three levels: with the children of the school N°12 and the teachers, with their families and with the local community, in order to get them to appropriate the building and know how to make the most of their resources, both from a functional point of view and from a pedagogical, educational and social point of view. FinancingThe project A Sustainable School Argentina has a budget that exceeds $ 400,000 and will be donated to the state. A large part of this funding comes from sponsors that we have obtained along our way, another part is contributed by work and logistical and material support of the Municipality of Mar Chiquita and the Tagma and Amartya teams. Another funding source is the realization of courses and workshops that allow us to share the knowledge generated in these experiences. In addition, we add this source of collective financing that will allow us to specifically ensure educational and community work throughout 2018, promoting the appropriation of the building by the community and the final success of the project.For this last source of funding, we have thought a series of returns that go from local to virtual and that aim to spread the project and at the same time give our collaborators new knowledge.The goal set by this campaign is directly associated with the work that our team will develop throughout 2018 to achieve the correct appropriation of the building by the community. This includes workshops, meetings, transfers, the development and supervision of an educational program and a community proposal that will make the new school an engine of change for those who inhabit it and a center of innovation for the people that surround it. The closer we get to the goal, the longer we can work on this! METAS Y FINANCIAMIENTOTOPE: USD 90.000Con USD 40.000 - Es 1 de marzo y logramos comprar todos los materiales y equipos para finalizar la construcción de la primera escuela pública autosustentable de Argentina!Con USD 60.000 - Llegamos al 30 de abril de 2018 y podemos retribuir el trabajo de todos los técnicos, profesionales y emprendendores que hacen posible la construcción del edificio, la ejecución de los talleres educativos y experiencias comunitarias en Mar Chiquita y el equipo de comunicación que llevará nuestro mensaje al mundo!Con USD 90.000 - Llega noviembre de 2018 y logramos llevar adelante talleres educativos para los niños de las escuela Sustentable de Mar Chiquita, capacitaciones para todo el personal docente, talleres para todas las escuelas públicas de Mar Chiquita, visitas al edificio para los interesados en conocer más sobre esta experiencia, generamos charlas y presentaciones en diferentes puntos de Latinoamérica, pudimos responder y acompañar a diferentes proyectos e intereses de la región.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------STOP: USD 90,000With USD 40,000 - It is March 1 and we managed to buy all the materials and equipment to complete the construction of the first self-sustaining public school in Argentina!With USD 60,000 - We arrive at April 30, 2018 and we can reward the work of all the technicians, professionals and entrepreneurs that make possible the construction of the building, the execution of educational workshops and community experiences in Mar Chiquita and the communication team that will take our message to the world!With USD 90,000 - November 2018 arrives and we managed to carry out educational workshops for the children of the Mar Chiquita Sustainable School, training for all the teaching staff, workshops for all the public schools of Mar Chiquita, visits to the building for those interested in knowing more about this experience, we generated talks and presentations in different parts of Latin America, we were able to respond and accompany different projects and interests from the region.Nuestras recompensas / Our rewards1. if you want to collaborate We thank you so much for your invaluable collaboration to the construction of the Argentina Sustainable School project!1.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>Hello! My name is Mary Van Dyke. I am a second year English teacher at Lompoc Valley Middle School in Lompoc, CA. This year I will be teaching 8th grade English and Beginning ELD. You may know ELD as ESL or English as a Second Language. </p>
<p>I am spending my time during summer vacation on this website and in my local community trying to raise funds for my classroom. Specifically, I am raising money in order to create a classroom library. As a second year teacher, I have not had much time to collect and grow my supply of age appropriate reading material. I want to give my students all possible advantages and hate thinking that my lack of years as a teacher may be a detriment to them. </p>
<p>Moreover, many of my students are in particular need of appropriate reading material. Lompoc Valley Middle School serves a community that is both diverse and economically disadvantaged. As a ELD teacher, I often find myself in need of books written with Spanish, Korean, or Arabic translations. Sadly our small school library does not have these specialized materials. Additionally, many of my English speaking students are remedial or reluctant readers. These students also need specialized materials in order to succeed. They need high interest, level appropriate books available to them in the safety and comfort of their own classroom. </p>
<p>In its simplest form, this is a campaign to buy books for kids in need, but I see it as so much more than that. I see this as an opportunity to give a small measure of power back to a classroom teacher. This is not a problem that can be solved by simply walking kids to a library. They need someone who knows them for guidance.  My students need help obtaining reading material that is appropriate for their reading level and interests. And I need help from my community to acquire these materials. So in the end, this becomes a campaign for community. Each book bought by a complete stranger will be more proof to my students that people really do care and believe that they can succeed. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>For this campaign, I am asking for a rather modest amount: 2,000 USD. I came to this figure by estimating how many books I will need and how much each book will cost. I have already purchased two, five-shelf bookcases with my own money. Each shelf holds about 20 books. Thus, in order to fill these bookcases I will need about 200 books (20 books x 5 shelves x 2 bookcases). I then estimated the cost of each book at about 10 USD in order to come up with my overall goal of 2,000 USD. I know that many of the books I purchase will be much less than 10 dollars. Used paperback novels sell on Amazon for about half that amount. However, I will also need to buy specialized materials, such as translated novels, that will be more expensive than 10 dollars. Also, I would like to buy some of the latest young adult novels that will not yet be offered as used and thus will be more expensive as well.</p>
<p>Now for the fun part: the perks! This is my favorite part of this campaign because both you as a contributor and my students will be able to see exactly what your money bought: a book! Each dollar earned in this campaign will go toward books and only books. When you contribute, you will get your name and picture (optional) put on the inside cover of the book you helped to purchase under the introduction: ""This book was generously donated by:"" Donate a small amount and you will be one of several donors who purchase a used or new book together. If you donate a larger amount you can purchase a new or used book all by yourself! Additionally when you chose to donate a larger amount, you will have the option of suggesting what book your donation purchases (as long as it's age appropriate and teacher approved, of course). This is a great way to share your favorite childhood book with a whole new generation. Finally, every donor will receive a personal thank you email from me and donors of a new book will receive a thank you postcard from a student! </p>
<p>Finally, one of the best parts of this campaign is that I don't even have to reach my entire goal for you to make an impact! Every dollar raised will go towards purchasing a book whether I reach the 2,000 dollar amount or not. You can't lose by donating to this campaign; if you donate, a child will get a book to read!  </p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>I've already touched on the specific needs of my particular students. They are English Learners. They are economically disadvantaged. They are remedial and reluctant readers. And they are in need of a teacher who knows them, knows their reading level and interests, and, most importantly, has the resources at hand to support them. </p>
<p>In addition to giving my students the material assistance they need, I truly believe this show of support from people all over their community, state, country, or even world will give my students the moral encouragement they need to be successful in reading. Many of my students have never been out of the small town of Lompoc where they are from and live. Also, many are from families that, for one reason or another, did not receive much education. I hope this campaign will make my students feel more connected to the world outside Lompoc and more convinced of the value of education. </p>
<p>Finally, if this project is successful, I hope it will open doors for my school and my fellow teachers. As a new, young teacher, I often get described as idealistic. Many of the veteran teachers at my school look to me, often skeptically, for new ideas, creative uses for modern technology, and sometimes even motivation. I would love for my classroom library of donated books to stand as an example for my school community of what can be accomplished when you think creatively and believe in people.  </p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>I feel like this campaign is unique from other campaigns on this website and websites like it in that there is very little risk to donating. As I said before, any donation you make will buy a book for my classroom library. That said, I believe the challenge for this little campaign will be reaching enough people to meet my intended goal. To this end, I will be launching my own personal campaign to get it attention. I will be reaching out to family, friends, and my local community of Santa Barbara, CA for support and help generating awareness. Which leads me to...</p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you cannot donate monetarily, you can still help greatly by spreading the word about this campaign to anyone and everyone you know that can. So please share this campaign on your Facebook page, email the link to coworkers, and tell your family and friends. The more people who know about this campaign the more books will be bought. I cannot tell enough people all by myself. And as I've said many times, while this campaign is about getting needed reading materials to students, it's also about fostering a sense of community and convincing kids that you believe in their ability to succeed, both of which require no money at all. </p>
<p>Thank you sincerely for your time and support. </p>

<p>Over the past 2 years we've each found healing within native wisdom through our relationships with various wisdom keepers and elders. We have learned how to be in right relationship with ourselves, one another, and our planet. We have undergone ceremonial rites of passage that have helped us to better understand who we are, and why we're here on this planet - something that is missing from modern western culture and that leaves youth our age addicted &amp; disempowered.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Most people today (and sadly, for most of our youth) spend their whole lives lost, wondering who they are and why they're here. We've found that through integrating Indigenous Wisdom into our lives we’ve been more capable of embodying and living from a worldview based in interconnectivity. We now know that it is our life’s mission to be of service to facilitating the collective shift from a worldview that is unsustainable to a worldview based in interconnectivity, interdependence, and sustainability.</p>
<p>We have been blessed with the opportunity to spend 6-weeks (Sept 26th - Nov 9th) in Peru studying and building relations with the Shipibo, Q’ero and Aymaran Cultures. We feel that it is important for us to further ground ourselves in tradition and ancient wisdom so that we can better be a beacon of light to our generation and generations to come through our work with Generation Waking Up &amp; <a href=""http://www.iamlifeproject.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">IAMLIFE</a> - balancing the fruits of the modern world with the fruits of the indigenous world and protecting our one and only home! </p>
<p>From <b>Sept 26th - October 15th</b> we will study with a Shipibo family of healers (see photos below) in Pucalpa, Peru, learning about traditional plant medicines and journeying deep in to the jungle to meet other tribes.  They create unique telas (tapestries) that embody medicine songs and give protection and we are offering these as perks so that you can directly support this family and our ability to study with them. Long term, the IAMLIFE Project will be supporting this family through selling their telas and other artwork via the IAMLIFE website and this is our intention for building ongoing, reciprocal relations. </p>

</div></div>","Hey Family, We (Puma & David) have devoted the last 20 months to learning how to facilitate the Wake Up Experience (which was born from the Pachamama Alliance’s connection with the Achuar Tribe in Ecuador 19 years ago) at schools, organizations, festivals, and Universities to groups numbering over 60 participants! The foundation of this experience is changing the “dream” & story of the modern world which is based in separation and is fundamentally unsustainable - meaning that it is destroying Pachamama. Then we share the possibility of a new story based in interconnectivity and inter-beingness, and point to its roots in First Nation’s, Indigenous Cultures.
Over the past 2 years we've each found healing within native wisdom through our relationships with various wisdom keepers and elders. We have learned how to be in right relationship with ourselves, one another, and our planet. We have undergone ceremonial rites of passage that have helped us to better understand who we are, and why we're here on this planet - something that is missing from modern western culture and that leaves youth our age addicted & disempowered.

We've found that through integrating Indigenous Wisdom into our lives we’ve been more capable of embodying and living from a worldview based in interconnectivity. We now know that it is our life’s mission to be of service to facilitating the collective shift from a worldview that is unsustainable to a worldview based in interconnectivity, interdependence, and sustainability.

From October 19th - November 1st we will embark on a 14-day pilgrimage guided by two Wisdom Keepers from the Q'ero and Aymaran cultures and the Reviveolution Team to sacred sites around Peru and Bolivia, collaborating and strengthening the vision of Reviveolution: ""To redefine ""modern culture"" as a global community which educates and inspires all present and future generations to maintain a lasting symbiotic relationship with each other and the living planet...To empower indigenous cultures, and all individuals in the world, to reconnect to our ancestral roots and walk in collective sustainable action as stewards of this Earth.""  This pilgrimage is the first of many meetings to ground and nurture dynamic collaboration and reciprocity between the IAMLIFE Project and Reviveolution, including their longer-term vision of building an Inkan ""Tawantinsuyo"" (""the four united regions"") Eco-Temple Sanctuary for Indigenous leaders to gather in spiritual practice to pass forth ancestral wisdom and traditional healing to all individuals of the present and future generations.

The Project: Fun African Poetic Expressions for Kids
I've always loved children; teaching, playing and even singing to them is a marvellous feeling. My drive is that they are the future. And growing up in Africa, I can attest to the fact that we are blessed with so much talent and untapped resources which would afford the world a great deal of virtue.We want to make cartoons, children series and movies that will show the world what Africa has to offer.Unlike what the Media says about Africa, hunger, corruption, religious crisis, savagery; Africa is a beautiful land...glorious and rich with wonderful wonders.....a land of diverse cultures, traditions and heritage that we want to help preserve and share with the world.What better way than to pass them on and teach them to our kids in a fun and educative way?We decided to partner with Dr. Odiniya, a retired Senior Official of the Federal Civil service of Nigeria to bring his book “The Power of Poetic Expressions” to life.The book contains Nursery rhymes and Poems which reflect core values such as Happiness, Peace, Courage, Confidence, Sharing, Unity and Respect.In this Project, we teach common and new African poems children that can relate to.For example: The Colours of my bow:Everything from Character design to composing of scores and voice overs was done in our little studio. We are planning and have started to train the local youth in the core basics of multimedia. This is our way of giving back to them. That way they can develop these talents from a young age.In Africa, there has been a downward spiral in children’s educative content. Africa’s main stream media is focused mainly on Home movies and music videos which really don’t offer much or even little to the growth and development of children.How You Can Help and What You Will GetBy helping us achieve this goal, you’ll be contributing not only in producing the DVD but also to a greater cause; training the youth in the community in animation, drama, design, art, music and even video editing.That way will help and encourage them to learn how to express themselves through the above listed including Science and even learning from other cultures by meeting people from different parts of the world and making friends. An experience they will cherish for a lifetime.We will also like to set up a network in the near future so that the voices of these talented youths and those that have interest in Nigeria and other parts of Africa can be heard and showcased to the whole world.How Will the Funds Raised Be Used?
Paying talent fees. This includes writers, actors etc.
Research, translation into different African languages
Equipment/Software leasing and purchasing
Marketing
Development of a new website for the project 
Training up and hiring local animation talent 
Legal services
Financial services
Advertising services
Running overhead costs
We believe that even if the amount we want to raise is not reached, we can still use what has been raised to build and nurture the talents of these youths because only then can we increase in strength and number and then our voice will be heard even louder.Investing in lives is what we believe in and we have taken a stand in our belief which is to level the playing field for those who have talent and don't have the means to improve and even showcase their work.We appreciate your going through this short summary of what we are trying to achieve.

I had to realize that there wasn't any similar plugins on the WordPress.org at that time, so I decided to create one.I developed the plugin in my free time and shared it with the WordPress community for FREE. I still update the plugin when I have time for it.But I want to lift this plugin to the next levelThe next step would be to create Soccer Info 2.0 that has new features that was already asked by more individuals before.New features:
Ability of adding the teams' logos
Ability of changing the default name of the teams
Possibility to create individual page for the teams or adding external link to the official site of the team
Adding advanced styling options
other new features may come up during the development
What I need?I need ""only"" TIME... and we all know: ""time is money"" ... but it is getting harder and harder to get enough time for this because I have to work and feed my family just like anyone else does. Just like You!My idea to solve this ""time and family feeding issue"" is to take 2 months off and spend it on the creation of the new plugin.
I will need $2.400 to pay my bills/rent/food/etc during the development

$1.100 to pay the VPS hosting for the next 1 year
All dollars above the goal will be used on ads to spread the word of the new version of the plugin.
Other ways you can HelpIt may happen that you can't afford to contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help me. You can spread the words!

</p><p>Six years ago, I was looking to volunteer at an NGO in India over the summer, as I was already in the country for family reasons. My search led me to Uttam and Shobha Kumar, two humble and passionate people that were running a small childrens' home called ""Spandana"", on the outskirts of Hyderabad. The story of Spandana started when Uttam and Shobha came across a mentally challenged 11-year old girl sleeping on the streets, surviving on chapati's and water that an auto rickshaw driver would share with her every day. Uttam and Shobha asked around but no one claimed any responsibility of this girl; she was completely abandoned. They decided to take responsibility for her. After weeks of caring for her, making sure she rested, ate well, and improved in condition, they placed her in a center for mentally challenged children. But the experience left them with a sense of duty, that they somehow needed to continue opening up their home to children that were abandoned, or children whose innocence was compromised by disturbing upbringings. Thus began Spandana. For years, Uttam and Shobha have been welcoming more children as they have been able- orphans, semi-orphans, abandoned children, and children from troubling backgrounds. Now there are 50 children under the complete care of Spandana - 25 girls and 25 boys, aged 4-16 years old. Uttam and Shobha - one couple - have taken full responsibility for 50 kids, and have assumed the position of being parents to every single one of these children. In spending even a day at the home, anyone can easily see how Uttam and Shobha take serious care of their kids, in every aspect, providing them with a healthy and love-filled childhood that is so very different than their pasts. As Uttam and Shobha have made this commitment among themselves to realize their duty, for changing the trajectory of many children's' lives, I've made a similar commitment to help Spandana become financially secure, and to help Uttam and Shobha be in a position to welcome more needy children. They want to be able to impact more children, but they are severely financially restrained. Spandana is restrained. Uttam and Shobha are only two people, and as they are running the organization, managing all the logistics and daily errands, dealing with the children's health and education needs, providing personal counseling to each kid, amongst a ton of other jobs required by this work... they simply do not have the bandwidth to secure the funds that they need for these kids. However, a little can go a long way at Spandana, and on this Christmas season, I'd like to invite anyone interested to play a role in Uttam and Shobha's mission with these kids for 2015. I basically moved into Spandana and I have become like family with everyone at the home. As you'd fight for your family, I am too. Uttam and Shobha haven't been able to raise the funds needed to cover all the kids' schooling for the 2015-2016 year. I'm inviting you to play a small role in this, whatever you can, whatever you want. The education costs for each kid at Spandana, including materials and notebooks, is $80 USD per year. In addition, Uttam and Shobha have been hoping to set the kids on a nutritious diet, including one glass of milk daily, and a few eggs a week, for each of their kids. But the costs of milk and eggs this regularly for 50 kids are too high for their current budget, so they've had to sparse out this nutrition. Again, I'd like to provide the opportunity to play a role here. The groceries for Spandana costs around $90 USD per week, for the entirety of the home. Until I can get some long-term donors and partnerships in place, I'm pushing for my little brothers and sisters over at Spandana to eat well and hearty every day. You can be 100% certain that 100% of your donations will go directly to the schooling and groceries for the kids at Spandana. This campaign is about relationships and care. You don't know these children, and they don't know you, but your futures may be tied; in offering a helping hand, you're offering a relationship of love and support to someone that may take your hand and truly appreciate it. To me, that's what Christmas has always been about, and I'm sure that you may feel the same way too.

</h3> <p></p>
<p>Hi, I'm Audrey! I'm the editor of The Recompiler, a new magazine about deepening our knowledge of technology in a fun, participatory way. I've been building free/open source software, community-based technology education, and print and digital media throughout my career, and now I'm ready to bring it all together into an awesome new project.</p>
<p>The Recompiler will invite writers and artists who work and play with technology to share what they know: how do things work? who builds what? how much can we take apart, and what will it look like to rebuild our technology and make it better? We'll do this through a quarterly print and online magazine. As a subscriber, you will be a part of our learning community.</p>
<p>Your contributions will pay for the writing, illustration, editing, and publishing costs of our first issue in Summer 2015. The Recompiler is especially focused on sharing the work of underrepresented groups, including women, people of color, people with disabilities, queer, genderqueer, and trans people. Your contribution supports these groups in sharing their technical work, knowledge, and skills.</p>
<h3>What's the Plan?</h3>
<p>The Recompiler will publish quarterly print issues, and at least four companion online issues each year. In order to do this, we need to pay for writers, artists, editing, print design, web design, and for printing and shipping the magazine to you. Your contribution will go toward all these costs so we can get our first issue out the door.</p>
<p>You have two annual subscription options: a full print subscription, one issue per quarter, or online-only preview access to the website articles. I love print magazines: you can hold them, share them, write on them, or cut them apart. They’re accessible even when you don’t have internet or power nearby. But digital text is accessible in different ways, allowing for screen readers, cutting &amp; pasting examples, and sending links to friends. So we’re doing both.</p>You can choose additional perks, like a gift subscription for a friend, or tickets to our launch party in June, or you can participate in our first issue by contributing a question to the advice column (you will get an answer!) We’re also commissioning a series of hand-knit custom-designed Recompiler hats to offer subscribers who contribute $500 and up (<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/totalnerd/sets/72157633308833866/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">see the artist’s other work</a>).<p></p>
</div> <div> <h3>A Magazine About...<br/>
</h3>
<p>We're excited about sharing our knowledge, bridging gaps, and supporting the full diversity of participants in technology. Each issue will have tutorials, discussion, criticism, and analysis designed to help us:</p>
<ul>
<li>grow our technology skills</li>
<li>understand the full stack, from user to hardware</li>
<li>build better technical and social infrastructure</li>
<li>learn more about areas of technology that have a deep impact on what we can or can’t do, like systems, networks, security, and other back-end software</li>
<li>create sustainable, welcoming communities<br/>
</li>
</ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>While I have experience with writing, editing, and publishing on a smaller scale, the scope of this project is larger than I’ve attempted before in this context. I intend to use the experience I have with other community-focused tech projects, such as <a href=""http://opensourcebridge.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Open Source Bridge</a> and <a href=""http://calagator.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Calagator</a>, to help guide me and keep me organized. I also have a great network of colleagues to advise me and provide support.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, the first issue may need to be scaled back or delayed until we have enough subscribers to support it. Contributing now helps us bring you the full level of articles, tutorials, and other content as planned.</p>

Over 25 College of Agriculture student clubs  inspire others to See What Ag Gives by hosting interactive  events across campus. In addition to club events, a student-led planning  committee organizes the club participation as well as hosts three events based  on educational, philanthropy and community goals.When is it and where is it?  Purdue Ag Week will take place Sunday April 12 – Friday,  April 17. It will take place all over the Purdue University Campus.  What are Ag Clubs Hosting?
 














Milk Monday—Free grilled cheese along with facts  about the dairy industry 
 














Pet-A-Kid—A goat kid, that is! 
 














Farmer’s Breakfast— Buy breakfast and learn  where food comes from
 














Farmer 5K – Grab your best farmer costume and  run in a 5K
 














Ag Jeopardy – answer questions correct and you get  free beef jerky 















What else is going on during Ag Week?   The student planning committee behind Purdue Ag  Week, the Task Force, is sponsoring three special events
 














The first is a food-packing event, Hammer Down Hunger.  Last year at Hammer Down Hunger, members of  the Purdue community packed over 57,000 meals for schoolchildren in Haiti.  At this year’s event, our goal is to pack  70,000 meals!

It’s about time!

Mükava (Mū kå vå) is the world’s first ergonomic reading table.</p><p></p><p><b>The Project</b></p><p>We noticed during our research that as a 
result of trying to read a book, a tablet or phone for a prolonged 
period of time, many people develop pain in their neck and wrists.  The 
phenomena of ‘Tech Neck’ and 'Ipad Wrist' are getting a lot of coverage 
in the press these days.  As a result of this pain we read less or 
cannot work as long as we’d like to with our tablets. </p><p>After 
talking with many people who use tablet holders, we wanted to address 
four important points that they find dissatisfying about using the 
tablet holders currently on the market: </p><p>• Most tablet holders take time and can be difficult to assemble</p><p>
•	It takes time to swap out tablets with the current designs</p><p>•	Concern that today's tablet holder won’t be able to hold future tablets </p><p>
•	When it’s not being used, a tablet holder just takes up space</p><p>Great
 design can add to the décor of any home or office. We believe that 
there is no need to chose between beautiful design and functionality. We
 have tried to address these points with a new kind of tool that we hope
 you will enjoy;<b> Mükava </b>and<b> Mükava For Monitor Arm.</b></p><p>Mükava

open our tooling.  We have worked extremely hard to ready this product 
for Kickstarter and full-scale manufacturing and fulfillment, and here 
are the risks that I see:</p>
<p>MANUFACTURING: Creating the tooling to manufacture a product like 
Mükava requires working with suppliers who can deliver parts to our 
exacting standards consistently. To minimize that possibility of making 
mistakes we're working with tooling manufacturers and a production 
partner with a demonstrated dedication to quality. </p>
<p>PRODUCT ADJUSTMENTS: As Mükava gets ready for production, there will 
likely be some minor adjustments to improve the final product. The 
prototypes made to date are made to test and refine the product and 
allow us to incorporate our adjustments and those suggested by 
experienced manufacturing partners. All adjustments will be made for a 
better end user experience and these improvements will be both noted in 
the project updates and on the product pages of our website: <a href=""http://www.mukava-tables.com/shop/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.mukava-tables.com/shop/</a> and our Kickstarter blog : <a href=""http://www.mukava-tables.com/kickstarter/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.mukava-tables.com/kickstarter/</a>.</p>
<p>FULFILLMENT: Sometimes things go awry that can’t be planned for and 
there will no doubt be some surprises along the road, but any obstacle 
will be addressed by combining our internal knowledge with external 
expertise, and an overall goal of making the best possible product for 
you. </p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Tom</p><br/></div>","A new way to read books and tablets? It’s about time!

Mükava (Mū kå vå) is the world’s first ergonomic reading table.The ProjectWe noticed during our research that as a 
result of trying to read a book, a tablet or phone for a prolonged 
period of time, many people develop pain in their neck and wrists.  The 
phenomena of ‘Tech Neck’ and 'Ipad Wrist' are getting a lot of coverage 
in the press these days.  As a result of this pain we read less or 
cannot work as long as we’d like to with our tablets. After 
talking with many people who use tablet holders, we wanted to address 
four important points that they find dissatisfying about using the 
tablet holders currently on the market: • Most tablet holders take time and can be difficult to assemble
•	It takes time to swap out tablets with the current designs•	Concern that today's tablet holder won’t be able to hold future tablets 
•	When it’s not being used, a tablet holder just takes up spaceGreat
 design can add to the décor of any home or office. We believe that 
there is no need to chose between beautiful design and functionality. We
 have tried to address these points with a new kind of tool that we hope
 you will enjoy; Mükava and Mükava For Monitor Arm.Mükava
 is designed to change the way we interact with all the things that we 
read or browse our tablets. It’s a new category of furniture!Here are some of the key features:Mükava comes ready to go out of the box. This means its the perfect gift
 to send to someone who suffering from pain from prolonged tablet use 
without having to worry about having to set it up for them.Mükava is both a side table and a reading table. When you are finished 
using Mükava, it folds into a side table. Mükava’s stand system allows 
for Mükava to be adjusted to more 
than 12 different positions to accommodate how you read or watch your 
table devices. We have filed for four patents because of the 
breakthrough technology included in this product!Mükava Premium (as show above) comes in an all brushed stainless steel 
finish for both the stand and the reading surface.  It's perfect also 
for reading or watching a movie in bed!Mükava Premium comes with a brushed steel stand and a brushed steel appearance on the reading surface while Mükava comes with a white stand and either a white or birch wood finish for the reading surface.Mükava's reading surface is made with materials to keep it hygienic 
and it's super easy to clean with standard household cleaners.With
 the proprietary Mükava Pad, you can put safely put any tablet or phone 
on Mükava in just seconds and swap out devices easily! Each Mükava comes
 with three (3) Mükava Pads so that everyone in the house can keep 
theirs on their device, ready to use with the family Mükava.USB Charging Ports & Removable USB Light
Mükava's 2 USB charging ports allow you to charge your tablet and use
 the USB reading light simultaneously! Mükava's power adapter is rated 
at 100-240V, 50-60 Hz input power and 5 volts, 4 amps of output power 
making it useful anywhere in the world.The removable USB light has one touch control for on and off as well to adjust the light levels.

Book Bands and Document PebblesDocument Pebbles are stored neatly in the back of Mükava and are used 
for securing documents on the surface of Mükava while working in the 
office or in the kitchen.To hold traditional books, we include adjustable book bands for 
traditional books and magazines so that people of all ages can read 
hands-free. Mükava Premium and Mükava for Monitor ArmWe created a monitor arm version of Mükava that fits onto any standard monitor arm equipped with a VISA plate.Mükava
 for Monitor Arm is useful for different work places like an office or 
kitchen where the full stand version is not convenient. Use Mükava for

      Uncle Sam’s Lady (USL) will be the main character of a monthly students (Comics) bilingual newsletter or magazine distributed in elementary, secondary schools and or some public places. The main goal and purpose is to make a positive addition to the U.S. educational curriculum focusing on topics and messages to strength students’ academic and personal development. Also its content would support teacher’s classroom and parenting management.    


Better 
Persons would 

Better S

tudents, B
etter Professionals, and G
reat C

itizens.” (USL)



The 1st Student’s Superhero will promote respect, kindness, good manners, sensitivity, appreciation toward himself, classmates, family, community members, disadvantage people, and mother's nature.  There are children or teens at homes with single mothers, divorced couples, both parents working, and or economic difficulties in  need of be oriented and supported.

As humanitarian and pacifist character USL wants to encourage and to teach students better ways to overcome  self destructive attitudes and negative habits. Defeating enemies like low-self esteem, low motivation, lack of concentration, anger, and bullying. Moreover, she remarks the importance of solving personal and social conflicts without being aggressive or violent.
                  “Never against You…Never against Others.” (USL) 

USL HAS FRIENDS AROUND THE WORLD & BEYOND !

This comics character is able to travel to other continents, space and through time contacting different friends and superheroes, even from ancient cultures, promoting multicultural values. Some USL friends are an AFRICAN Wizard, and an EGYPTIAN Magician, EARTHQUAKE from the Middle East, the Twin Karate CHINESE Masters, the SUN Warrior APOLLO (the LIGHT""), “Dama"" MESTIZA from Latin America, RAINBOW Women from the Cosmos, the GREEK Goddess Νίκη (Victoria), the European VIKING, the Australian ANZAC, the ABORIGINAL Warrior, PENGUIN MAN from Antarctica, and the HOT MUSICAL Lady from Pangea (The Supercontinent). Finally, the NIGHT Fancy Lady from any street in any country of the world.

 Why it is important your support to Uncle’s Sam Lady and to work shoulder to shoulder with her or to be part of her team?

When traditionally our schools watch mainly over the improvement of academic curriculum, raising test scores, and graduation rates. It is also crucial to support and to strength their inner superheroes too. The student as a person, and human being. Considering that children are the future of this country, and our entire planet.   
At first, more than  1 million students will benefit with the USL Civics and Social Studies program. 
Statistics
According to the latest report from the National Center for Education Statistics, there were about 98,300 public schools; 5,700 charter schools, and 30,900 private schools during the 2011-2012 school year.
In 2014, about 49.8 million students are attending to public elementary and secondary schools. 
~ 35.1 million are in prekindergarten through grade 8.
~14.7 million were registered grades 9 through 12. 

~4.1 million public school students are enrolled in 9th grade ( high school) (source).


~5.0 million students are attending to private schools (source).

The most money $$$$$$$$ raised the most schools, and places Uncle Sam's Lady, and her world friends would be able to visit and to impact.
Another of our future goals is to build a Teamwork to have an E-UNCLE SAM'S LADY MAGAZINE version too among many other promotional items, and events.
LOVE, Creativity, Perseverance, Dedication, Organization, Survivency, Leasing, Monetary Investment, Funding, Art Supplies, Artwork,  Sketching, Drawing,  Painting, Printing & Shipping Services, Technology, Softwares, Animation, Graphic Designing, Editing, Writing, Translating,Proofreading. Research, Covering Submission Deadlines, Publishing, Networking, Distributing, Press Releases, Advertising campaigns, Updating, Supervising, Public Relations, Overtime,Caring People & more is where your generous DONATION will go. 

                                   THANK YOU ~ MUCHAS  GRACIAS
                        FOR BEING ONE OF THE USL 2015 FOUNDERS

As an artist, journalist and former teacher, I truly believe that it will be great to count with your valuable support to make it true.

There are two orphanages in Nepal that the Mission runs, and I am going for a month to do volunteer work for the organization. I will be helping with anything they need, such as; assisting the children with their schoolwork, helping fix up the building, and making an informational video for the organization.</p>
<p>International volunteer work is something I have been passionate about and always wanted to do, and I have been researching and planning this trip all year. It is so important to me to be able to give back to the world and help out on this level. I believe so strongly in what this organization stands for and I am honored to be able to help out such a conscientious and wonderful cause. However, I cannot do it alone, I need help with funds for my trip. I have been working hard to pay for the trip myself, and have saved up all year, but in order to be able to afford to make a difference in these kids lives we need your support and any contribution helps. Unfortunatly, Luke David is no longer able to go on the trip. The $3000 was an estimation of what we would of needed if two people were going, but now that it is just me, I will only need $1000 (if this changes your donation please get in contact with me) and if I surpass that amount, all the proceeds will go directly to fund the Loving Arms Mission. If you are not in a position to donate, please just spread the word around about my project! Thank you for your care and generosity; I am extremely grateful.</p>

<p>As you know Megan just got into graduate school at the University of Sydney in Australia! I couldn't be more proud, and excited for her! This is an amazing opportunity for her to grow, learn, and continue her education and travel. Unfortunately, education comes with a price, a price that most people, including myself, cannot afford. Subsequently, Megan must reach out to everyone's new best friend, financial aid. However, as most of you know, financial aid doesn't provide the aid in the necessary time needed. It should be called ""Delayed Aid"", but that’s another story.</p>
<p>This is where your help and support comes in. Megan needs <strong>$3,000</strong> to secure her spot at the University of Sydney by <strong>October 1, 2013.</strong> Confiding in me of these financial worries, I decided something had to be done about this. So like any good friend I am making this public to all her friends and family ;). Every little bit helps!! </p>

<p>Have you ever felt you were born in the wrong time period? I have always thought I was an ""old soul,"" not meant for my generation. Years ago I asked, ""Shay, if you could travel back in time, which period would you go?"" I answered, ""the Classical period of Greece."" (Seriously, not kidding). The art and philosophy that flourished during that time have always attracted me. Albert Einstein unfortunately only proved we could travel a couple minutes into the future-- not decades into the past. Luckily, an opportunity to experience what I have always dreamt of has fallen into my grasp. </p>
<p>Every year, the New York Based theater company One Year Lease (<a href=""http://oneyearlease.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">oneyearlease.org</a>) holds a month long summer apprenticeship in Greece. Only fourteen artists are accepted each year; myself being one of the lucky few. The program is an opportunity that stands out amongst the rest. The Apprenticeship is lead by legendary professional artisits Kim Weild and Gabriel Cody. Amongst the famous Suzuki, Meisner, Lecoq, and Viewpoints training, I will be allowed access to the company's business production meetings and will have 45 minutes of Greek lessons each day. The highlight of the program will be working on the production of <em>The Birds</em> by Greek playwright Aristophanes. Even the thought of performing a 1500 year old Greek classic <em>in Greece </em>gives me goose bumps. <strong>The prgram dates: July 18th-August 18th.</strong></p>
<p>Acting and the arts are more than just my hobbies; they are my passions. Most importantly, they cleave together to form a life long career path. Through this opportunity I will hone my craft and learn how to better market myself as an artist to potential future employers. I will also be able to better market my own devised creations. </p>
<p>I am calling for help with the cost of attendence of this wonderful program.</p>

<h3>Hi! My name is Alison Gale Lotspeich and I have a passion for flight!</h3>
<p>I have researched for years and taken the necessary steps toward obtaining my Private Pilot License. Now, the only obstruction is funding. My overall goal is to immerse myself into the aviation community and eventually pursue a career in the field. Can you help me?</p>
<p>I truly believe that to aid and inspire others; one must continue to aid and inspire oneself. I have dedicated my life to do just that.</p>
<p>Currently, and for the better part of the last decade I have worked as a Certified Nursing Assistant specializing in Dementia Care. It has been a challenging and rewarding adventure, and I love the work that I do. I feel blessed and humbled to have been there for individuals and families when they need someone most.</p>
<p>Aside from that job, I also train in and perform various circus arts! Under the stage name Gale Force, I have entertained audiences around the country with high-energy performances on aerial fabric, hoop, and even a rocket ship! Stilt walking, unicycling, and hula hooping are some of the other ways I push the limits of human physicality and there is always room to grow.</p>
<p><br/><strong>The breakdown:<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>As you may know, this goal of $3,000 is a mere fraction of what I will need for materials, aircraft rental, instruction hours, and testing. In case you don't, I am looking at approximately $9,000 for the Private Pilot certificate alone (with which, according to the FAA, does not allow me to fly for hire). There will be more expenses once I work toward my Commercial license. But, if you can help me clear this first hurdle, I know I can make this dream a reality!</p>
<p>I am already in the process of obtaining books and tools I will need from discount sites like Ebay and Amazon, and have found some helpful books at used book stores. Any other advice or tips on where I can cut corners while still being safe and legal is greatly appreciated!</p>
<p> If you can help me meet my goal monetarily, great! Please check out my ""perks"" section for some awesome thank-you gifts! If you can't, no worries! I will generously accept an enthusiastic, ""You go, girl!"" I need all the love and support you can give me. Thank you!</p>

<p><strong>Haitian Midwife Ninotte Lubin will sit for the NARM exam in Feb 2013.</strong></p>
<p>Ninotte Lubin, Haitian midwife from Jacmel, Haiti, began her midwifery journey shortly after the earthquake in 2010. She came to work at Mother Health International birth clinic as a translator and quickly began learning about birth and midwifery care through observing volunteer midwives from around the world.  She was asked if she wanted continued to learn the skills of midwifery care with volunteer CNM (certified nurse midwives,) CPM, (certified professional midwives) and OBGYN.  She said, “Yes, I want to help the women in my community, I want to prevent needless deaths of mothers and babies.”  She later joined Olive Tree birth clinic also in Jacmel, and has continued her midwifery education with volunteer midwives as well as educational birth related conferences and seminars. </p>
<p>In October of 2012, she traveled for the first time out of her country to San Francisco and attended the MANA (Midwives Alliance of North America) conference as well as sat for the <a href=""http://narm.org/about-narm/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">NARM</a>* (Northern Registry of Registered Midwives) exam. You can imagine the culture shock as it was her first time out of her country. While she didn’t pass the exam the first time, she scored a 59 and needs 75 to pass the exam. This is phenomenal and she is very close to achieving her goal.</p>
<p>Ninotte will be one of the first Haitian midwives to obtain CPM** certification. Haiti needs more certified midwives to help reduce its maternal mortality rates.  Haiti has the highest rates of infant, under-five and maternal mortality in the Western hemisphere. (<em>UNICEF</em>)  670 pregnant women die per 100,000 live births in Haiti. (UNFPA). Haiti is ranked 36 world-wide in infant deaths with 63.7 children dying per 1,000 births; 71.5 die before they reach the age of 5 per 1,000.</p>
<p>Please support Ninotte today and make a donation of $15 or more. The impact on preventing deaths of mothers and babies in Jacmel will be tremendous. Everyone woman deserves this kind of care, especially during her pregnancy. All money raised will go to purchase her ticket from Haiti to the US and travel related expenses while she is in the US for 2 weeks. Volunteers will house, feed and transport her to and from the airport, exam etc. Thank you for your support and your kindness. </p>
<p>* NARM-North America Registry of Midwives NARM supports a health care system where every family in North America has access to skilled and responsible midwives. The individualized attention provided by the CPM in practice is of critical importance to her role as guardian of normal birth, and to the value of her compassionate maternity care. NARM sets standards for competency-based certification that allow a midwife to support a woman’s right to choose her birth attendants and place of birth and to involve those she identifies as her family in the birth experience. CPMs practice as autonomous health professionals working within a network of relationships with other maternity care professionals who can provide consultation and collaboration when needed.</p>
<p>As numerous studies have affirmed the safety of planned, midwife-attended birth at home, in hospitals, and in freestanding birth centers, NARM recognizes the potential for improved outcomes that include lower costs and fewer interventions to childbearing mothers and their babies when attended by Certified Professional Midwives.</p>

<p>On the morning of September 11, 2001, I found myself and 12 of my students on a ship in New York harbor approximately 2000 feet from the World Trade Center when it was attacked.  This terrible experience convinced me that we need to reach across our world, not with guns and bombs, but with education and peace.  I began a project called the Global Coalition for Peace, Education and Cultural Awareness:</p>
<p><a href=""http://bcsd.k12.ny.us/middle/global/global.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://bcsd.k12.ny.us/middle/global/global.htm</a></p>
<p>This project connects students and teachers around our planet.  Our schools have collaborated to assist local volunteers from New York's capital region to build schools in Africa and Belize.  I have a 12 year proven track record of sending hundreds of impoverished children to school and funding the construction of more than five schools.  This coming year, in July, 2014, I want to personally travel to Uganda to help rebuild a broken down school and train teachers in several schools.  I want to supply the schools with technology and teaching materials that will enable them to provide some of our planet's most impoverished children with a worthwhile education.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I will be traveling with a valid registered non-profit, The Giving Circle Inc., </p>
<p><a href=""http://www.thegivingcircle.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.thegivingcircle.org/</a></p>
<p>which has a proven track record of building schools and creating sustainable projects in Uganda.  The Ugandan government has a supportive working relationship with The Giving Circle Inc..</p>
<p>My original asking goal is $10,000, but my ultimate goal is $60,000.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The funds will purchase laptop computers, projectors, a generator, solar panels, books, maps, videos and an assortment of teaching materials to provide for two schools that already have a proven working relationship with the Giving Circle.   I will spend my time there training teachers in their utilization and classroom tools. I will travel to Uganda during July, 2014.</p>
<p>If I can raise more money - up to an additional $50,000, it will go to reconstruct a broken down school in the Jinja District of Uganda.   </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Uganda's children are some of the most impoverished on our planet.  There are over 2 million orphans.  By educating Uganda's children, we are creating a sustainable path toward improvement for both individuals and the nation.</p>
<p>I have a proven track record for success.  I am willing to provide any needed references and will follow through with this project.  Even if just a portion of the money is raised, I am already committed to this project and will find a way to make it succeed.  Our planet's children are our world's greatest hope.  They face challenges far greater than any previous generation.  Only through education can we make a real difference.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I also coordinate an International Children's Art Auction each spring at my school.  We receive art from children around the world, along with donations from local artists.  The money we raise goes directly to funding projects.  Last year we were able to help fund the construction of a kitchen for Ugandan children.  Any donations of sellable art can help.  You can also contact the Giving Circle Inc. and volunteer.</p>
<p>Please spread the word about this project.   Together we can make a difference</p>
<p>Mohatma Gandhi once said ""We must become the change we want to see in the world.""  As a teacher, learning that I can change the lives of our planet's most impoverished children, and teaching others that they can do the same has given my life value.  Our children must be educated to be able to become our planet's next (and better) generation of global leaders.  Together, we can make this happen.</p>
<p>Please help spread the word about this project.</p>

On the morning of September 11, 2001, I found myself and 12 of my students on a ship in New York harbor approximately 2000 feet from the World Trade Center when it was attacked.  This terrible experience convinced me that we need to reach across our world, not with guns and bombs, but with education and peace.  I began a project called the Global Coalition for Peace, Education and Cultural Awareness:
http://bcsd.k12.ny.us/middle/global/global.htm
This project connects students and teachers around our planet.  Our schools have collaborated to assist local volunteers from New York's capital region to build schools in Africa and Belize.  I have a 12 year proven track record of sending hundreds of impoverished children to school and funding the construction of more than five schools.  This coming year, in July, 2014, I want to personally travel to Uganda to help rebuild a broken down school and train teachers in several schools.  I want to supply the schools with technology and teaching materials that will enable them to provide some of our planet's most impoverished children with a worthwhile education.


What We Need & What You Get
I will be traveling with a valid registered non-profit, The Giving Circle Inc., 
http://www.thegivingcircle.org/
which has a proven track record of building schools and creating sustainable projects in Uganda.  The Ugandan government has a supportive working relationship with The Giving Circle Inc..
My original asking goal is $10,000, but my ultimate goal is $60,000.
 
The funds will purchase laptop computers, projectors, a generator, solar panels, books, maps, videos and an assortment of teaching materials to provide for two schools that already have a proven working relationship with the Giving Circle.   I will spend my time there training teachers in their utilization and classroom tools. I will travel to Uganda during July, 2014.
If I can raise more money - up to an additional $50,000, it will go to reconstruct a broken down school in the Jinja District of Uganda.   
 
The Impact
Uganda's children are some of the most impoverished on our planet.  There are over 2 million orphans.  By educating Uganda's children, we are creating a sustainable path toward improvement for both individuals and the nation.
I have a proven track record for success.  I am willing to provide any needed references and will follow through with this project.  Even if just a portion of the money is raised, I am already committed to this project and will find a way to make it succeed.  Our planet's children are our world's greatest hope.  They face challenges far greater than any previous generation.  Only through education can we make a real difference.
Other Ways You Can Help
I also coordinate an International Children's Art Auction each spring at my school.  We receive art from children around the world, along with donations from local artists.  The money we raise goes directly to funding projects.  Last year we were able to help fund the construction of a kitchen for Ugandan children.  Any donations of sellable art can help.  You can also contact the Giving Circle Inc. and volunteer.
Please spread the word about this project.   Together we can make a difference
Mohatma Gandhi once said ""We must become the change we want to see in the world.""  As a teacher, learning that I can change the lives of our planet's most impoverished children, and teaching others that they can do the same has given my life value.  Our children must be educated to be able to become our planet's next (and better) generation of global leaders.  Together, we can make this happen.
Please help spread the word about this project.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I've been teaching Social Studies at Balboa High School in San Francisco for 10 years now. I have a passion for teaching, which many of my students have pointed out to me over the years. We laugh a lot in my classes.</p>
<p>Specifically I am the director of the Law Academy, a two year, humanities-based pathway. I teach the Junior Pre-Law class, and the Senior American Democracy and Economics classes. The kids travel as a cohort to their social studies, lit and pathway elective classes. We have a very large alumni, and we're very proud of the work we've done.</p>
<p>The summer between Junior and Senior year I place our kids in internships at law offices (public, private and non-profit). It's an amazing experience, that they can take to any career. <br/></p>
<p>In 2007 I purchased a MacBook Pro and a Promethean Interactive Whiteboard, through a grant that I wrote. I use this computer every day for PowerPoint and Keynote presentations, video, student presentations, music, and more. It's safe to say that this computer is like another limb. This computer has limped along for a few years now. I've replaced the entire logic board and the screen, as well as run regular diagnostics every few weeks as needed. It's on it's very last legs. <br/></p>
<p>Over the years my presentations have evolved from your typical word-heavy approach, to image heavy, making the kids think deeper, and ask better questions. I've seen their own presentations be more lively year after year. </p>
<p>There's nothing worse than attempting to open up a presentation for class and the dreaded rainbow spiral of doom doesn't stop spinning!<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need $2500 to purchase a brand new 13"" MacBook Pro 2.6GHz with Retina display.</p>
<p>I will also purchase an external hard drive, and a hard cover for it.</p>
<p>I'll also purchase a remote control so I can walk the room and still utilize the computer.<br/></p>
<p>If I don't reach the goal I'll use what I get to make more repairs on the existing MacBook Pro. Let's hope it doesn't come to that. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>At my school I'm considered one of the GO TO people when it comes to technology. I've hosted many professional developments in my classroom for my peers. They come to me regarding the creation of PowerPoint's or Keynote, as well as Interactive Whiteboard activities. <br/></p>
<p>I teach the kids how to create powerful presentations, as well as debates. They too will utilize this new computer. By learning how to use modern technology this will guarantee they will rise above the current crop of young talent making their way into the workforce. <br/></p>

<div>We break down languages like PHP, HTML, CSS (etc) into individual topics such as ""Arrays"", ""Databases"", ""Variables"", etc.</div>
<div>This is hope for those who are visual learners can use our free videos rather than reading boring reference manuals/websites.</div>
<h2>Where your funding goes...</h2>
<div>First and foremost we need some better equipment.  In March of 2014 the workstation that I use to make the videos died on me.  This year I decided to start making all new videos in 1080 resolution (previous in 720).  Making the videos without a good machine is painfully slow.  The machine I am using now is awesome for web development but terrible for audio/video editing.</div>
<div>Other funding helps keep our lights on!  We need to keep our hosting up and running and other bills paid.  To put it simply, the more funding that we receive the less time I need to spend making income elsewhere.  More time = more videos and other resources! </div>
<div>The current goal is set to accomplish getting a new video editing workstation and allow me to spend the next 2-3 months focusing on videos and not on finding other jobs.  If we meet and exceed the goal I will keep putting 100% focus on videos for as long as the funding lasts! </div>
<h2>Thank You!</h2>
<div>Thanks everyone!  I have had a blast these last two years.  I have met many of you both online and during one on one training sessions. I have learned so much about other countries and cultures in the process.</div>
<div>I love making these videos and teaching one on one.  I want to keep on doing it!</div>

<br/>
</div></div>","Why we are asking for funding..I have been making these videos for about 2 years now.  We have well over 200 FREE tutorials on YouTube as of now.  We have nearly 15 thousand subscribers and over 2,5 million views.  Over the last year, changes with the internet affected my ability to keep pushing as much free content up on the web.Since I started doing these videos, I was able to spend less time working on development jobs and more time building training videos. Last year I was able to use the YouTube funding to basically cut my work day in half. I spent half my time doing videos and the other half doing development work for clients.With the popularity of extensions like AdBlock, I have seen an approx. 90% decline in ad revenue since this time last year.  Other tools that allow viewers to illegally download my videos from YouTube and watch them ad free has hurt us as well.I have the option to limit my future work to subscription based paid websites in order to recoup some of these losses and allow me to allocate the time to make content.  However, I want everyone to have the ability to learn from these videos and would like to raise enough money to keep putting my content on YouTube for all (or most of) the world to watch.Not to mention most of the paid video websites take 30-75% of the course cost and put it in their own pocket. So us instuctors barely see a profit.Here is info on our most recent and (possibly most popular) series...Learn 7 Web Development Languages/Concepts in 1 easy to follow project-based video series!

HTML - HyperText Markup Language: The main language for creating websites.

CSS - Cascading Style Sheets: Define the look and feel of a website.
Javascript -  Used to allow users to interact with a website.
JQuery - Make user interaction with Javascript much easier!
Ajax - Asynchronous Javascript & XML: Interact with data and elements without reloading a webpage.
PHP - PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor:  Create dynamic and database driven websites.
MySQL - My SQL:  One of the most widely used open-source database management systems.
About the 2014 Dynamic SeriesThe videos are within an ongoing project-based series titled: ""Developing a Dynamic Website"".  The series started in December of 2013.  Viewers follow me through the steps of building a dynamic website and Content Management System from start to finish.  What is a Dynamic Website?Have you ever wondered how websites are able allow a user to register, create profiles, and store personal information? Or, how about an online community with forums and blogs?  Maybe an eCommerce website to load, market, and sell your own products? Well, dynamic websites make that possible!At the core, dynamic websites can store information in a database and then display it on or even use it to manipulate a webpage.  Possible examples of such data could include: user information, image/photo information, settings, text, even code (which is how this very project summary is being saved and displayed write now!).Other Series and topics:We have other on going series as well. I am currently working on creating a brand new (and current) version of our most popular series ""Building a Website From Start to Finish"".Building a Website Series:Our first version of this series was released just before great tools like CSS3 and HTML5 were available for all browsers.  So in that series we use tools like Adobe's Photoshop and Illustrator to layout and design the website.Now days with CSS3 we can almost eliminate the need to use any graphic design tools.  Along with teaching this newer approach to web design, I will be including lessons on Javascript & JQuery.This series will then bump right up to the more advanced 2014 Dynamic Website Series.  So those who want to get deeper into the programming side of the web can keep on learning!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>The opportunity of a lifetime..that is what the In Zone Project has proven to be. In January 2011, founder of the In Zone Project and Director of the United Maori Mission, Terrance Wallace saw his vision become a reality. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The vision was to have young Maori and Pacific Island boys from around New Zealand be given the opportunity to attend one of New Zealand's most prestigious schools, Auckland Grammar School for boys. In order for this to happen the boys would live 'in zone' at one of the United Maori Mission hostels. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>As part of their stay at the hostel, the boys were required to participate in leadership and mentoring programs provided. ANZ bank partnered with the project to provide a financial literacy program and the boys were also given instruction in basic social and life skills, providing them with a foundation toward becoming valuable members of society and authors of their own success stories. Please visit our website for more information about our success.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The obvious success of the In Zone project led to an anticipated expansion in for 2012. 50 boys have been interviewed and selected to live 'In Zone'. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The reason for the URGENT appeal is because the doors to the property that was to be home to these 50 boys have been suddenly and unexpectedly shut!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>As a result we are required to do some major renovations to an existing alternative property. That's where you come in.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We need both financial support as well as hands on deck if you live locally.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The boys arrive on the 19th of January 2012. They need a 'home' to come to.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Within the first year the majority of the In Zone boys
excelled academically, school year ending December 2011. One particular student
made history having been promoted a total of eight levels over the school year.
<span style=""""> </span>At the annual prize giving, we were
excited to witness two of our boys receive academic awards and another two
awards for sporting achievements. Quite an accomplishment considering the
school has 2500 boys attending!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The In Zone boys inspired the entire third form (year 9)made up of 500 youth to learn and perform a traditional Maori Haka for the first time in the school's history. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In October 2011, the In Zone boys were asked to participate in the Rugby World Cup welcoming ceremony as well as the very first reunion for the 1987 All Blacks rugby team.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>These and many other accomplishments have greatly impacted, not only the lives of the boys but also their families and communities. More profound is the way they have proven that, given the opportunity they can maximize their potential.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If the hostel's required renovations are not completed the license will not be awarded and the building will be deemed unfit to live in. The In Zone project has no other alternative property. We have the will to succeed just like the boys in the In Zone Project and we believe that this project worth fighting for.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We need upward of $30,000 to see the hostel's material and labour costs covered. All funds received will be used towards renovations of some kind. The campaign will not cease if the goal is not met through this site we will continue to search for funds until the project is completed so your donation will not be in vain. We will be putting up progress footage as the weeks go on. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>All hands on deck! - If you are able to help with  on site labour ie. cleaning, stripping paint, pulling out carpet, washing windows, setting furniture etc or if you are a professional <span style='font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: ""Times New Roman"",""serif"";'></span>in any area of building, carpentry, plumbing, electrical or related trade please contact us via email twallace@umm.org.nz for location and time details.</p>

<p>Beczak Environmental Education Center has been in existence in Yonkers, New York for over 20 years and has continually run children and family programs that encourage all to learn about and care for the beautiful Hudson River. Beczak is part of the Hudson River Valley Environmental Education Institute, a very small 501(c)3 non-profit which focuses attention on protecting and teaching about local urban environment of the Lower Hudson Valley region.</p>
<p>This center provides a community gathering place for approximately 20,000 visitors annually to discover, explore and enjoy Hudson River wonders. We educate approximately 10,000 local schoolchildren each year, and that many individuals and families, with the shared goal of improving environmental awareness and understanding of practices which protect our natural world.</p>
<p>The location of an environmental center in such an urban setting plays a vital role in the local community. We offer a variety of free family events such as Summerfest - a daylong event featuring free seining and kayaking along with eco-friendly arts and crafts. In addition, Beczak runs multiple ""Catch of the Day"" seining programs every for children on school trips, for boy and girl scouts and as a birthday party, which involves catching fish in a 30-foot seine net, and then allowing children, with the help of education staff, to look and and touch the animals that are caught. Beczak also operates a winter, spring and summer camp for children that focuses primarily on cultivating an appreciation for nature and science using live animal specimens, hands-on learning and a whole lot of a getting messy. All of the programs offered help engage the youth of the Lower Hudson Valley and expose them to situations and experiences they might never see again.</p>
<p>We also offer two programs for adults each month. RiverTalks: Smart Conversation about the Hudson, gives oportunities to hear from, and talk to, adventurers, scientists, naturalists and writers. In October we'll host both Tom Lake, editor of Hudson River Almanac, and Jon Turk, who, National Geographic calls ""one of the top ten adventure atheletes of 2012.""  And for entertainmentl, we host Urban H2O, rocking roots concerts with local and regional talents. This November we welcome Sloan Wainwright to our riverfront space!</p>
<p>We encourage you to come visit Beczak! Inside you will find many tanks filled with critters that were caught right on our waterfront location by children. If you have been to Beczak, or have had a positive experience sending a child to Beczak, or enjoyed a presentation or concert, please consider donating. We want to be around to inspire all ages to learn about the Hudson River and all its creatures for a long time, but this won't be possible without your help! Any contribution, no matter how small will protect and sustain our preserve, living collections and property while providing educational and recreational opportunities loved by the whole community.</p>

<p class=""p1"">Mizik - n. (Creole) Music.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Konbit Mizik is a not-for-profit recording studio &amp; music school in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.  We incorporated as a NYS not-for-profit corporation about a year ago, and are waiting for approval from the IRS for 501(c)3 tax-exempt status.  Most of our operations to date have been venturing into some of the most disadvantaged parts of Haiti, recording underground artists and youth while providing instruction on music theory, audio recording, and video production.  </p>
<p class=""p1"">Our long-term vision is to create a brick and mortar home with state-of-the-art equipment, proficient instructors, and respectful &amp; responsible staff and students, which can serve as the home for an exchange program for professors, students, and musicians from around the world.  In the meantime, we will continue to record Hait's most talented and vulnerable youth, produce music videos and concerts, and develop music curricula and programs in communities throughout Port-au-Prince and across the country.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Konbit Mizik is a movement of smart, talented, and caring individuals from all spectra who believe that, in our increasingly-interconnected global community, it is important to celebrate our common values and acknowledge our collective ability to work, teach, learn, play music and rebuild Haiti together.</p>
<p><span>Konbit Mizik issues a receipt for your donation with our taxpayer ID number and we require all funds expended be reviewed by John F.

Konbit Mizik is a not-for-profit recording studio & music school in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.  We incorporated as a NYS not-for-profit corporation about a year ago, and are waiting for approval from the IRS for 501(c)3 tax-exempt status.  Most of our operations to date have been venturing into some of the most disadvantaged parts of Haiti, recording underground artists and youth while providing instruction on music theory, audio recording, and video production.  
Our long-term vision is to create a brick and mortar home with state-of-the-art equipment, proficient instructors, and respectful & responsible staff and students, which can serve as the home for an exchange program for professors, students, and musicians from around the world.  In the meantime, we will continue to record Hait's most talented and vulnerable youth, produce music videos and concerts, and develop music curricula and programs in communities throughout Port-au-Prince and across the country.
Konbit Mizik is a movement of smart, talented, and caring individuals from all spectra who believe that, in our increasingly-interconnected global community, it is important to celebrate our common values and acknowledge our collective ability to work, teach, learn, play music and rebuild Haiti together.
Konbit Mizik issues a receipt for your donation with our taxpayer ID number and we require all funds expended be reviewed by John F. Payne Associates, Inc., assuring complete transparency for our donors.  A multi-lingual accounting staff reviews, categorizes, and authorizes every dollar spent.

<p><strong></strong>Hello, I'm Lara. Above you can see me planting a tree on my previous trip to Israel. During my eleven-day trip to Israel last February, I planted an acorn of interest, but now I desire to return for a longer stay to see whether that acorn will bury deep roots and grow into a tree. My initial visit instilled in me a strong desire to learn more about this country and my heritage, and ten months there will serve to further me on this quest. This is why I am participating in a ten-month MASA-affiliated program through the volunteering organization Tikkun Olam in Tel Aviv-Jaffa. I study different perspectives on Israeli-Arab relations while living amongst the populations I serve. Volunteering opportunities include working at Arab-Jewish community centers, English tutoring and more. During my stay I will also take Hebrew lessons, tour the country and take lessos on Israeli culture and Jewish identity. Through the intense process of immersing myself in the coexistence movement in Israel, I expect to develop a greater sense of self and sense of purpose in the world. Learn more about the program here: <a href=""http://tikkunolamisrael.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://tikkunolamisrael.org/</a></p>
<p>As this is a volunteering program, MASA and Tikkun Olam try to keep it affordable, but there are still considerable costs involved. With the cost of the program, plane tickets, food and other incidentals, it adds up to thousands. Any amount you can contribute would be greatly appreciated. Even if you do not feel you can contribute at this time, I would love it if you share this page with friends who might be interested. </p>
<p>I have always loved learning about different cultures and meeting foreign people on their own terms to gain a well-rounded and complex worldview. The opportunity to engage with Israeli and Arab populations on their own turf will provide me with unique and invaluable insight into the ongoing conflict and the concurrent efforts toward coexistence. I truly believe in the Jewish tenet dictating that it is each person’s duty to repair the world (""tikkun olam""). While our global and local communities are slowly progressing toward acceptance and inclusion of all kinds, it takes strong people diligently holding the line to ensure society does not backslide into hatred, prejudice and violence. I have the will and the powerful desire to dedicate myself to facilitating peace and understanding among individuals and their surroundings at large. All people are inherently equal, regardless of sex, race, or ability, and I strive to put an end to domination ideologies and oppressive systems.</p>

This fundraising is to help pay for the cost of volunteering with Global Volunteer Network, anything you can donate brings me closer to Uganda! Even if I don't meet my goal, anything contributed will help with the cost. 
Other Ways You Can HelpI completely understand not being able to afford to donate, it would really help me out if you could share this campaign, and also throw any questions/ criticisms at me on twitter (@elliesheep93) so I can go out there with as much information and so I can be as sensitive as possible in my work - I don't want to ""white saviour complex"" this, I want to be helpful and supportive!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

We are collecting and sharing the stories of individuals who are impacted by various types of state violence and repression. Many of these cases relate to police brutality, false arrests, imprisonment, and confessions gained through torture. This is coupled with higher prison terms given by judges and disproportionate rates of drug and death penalty cases all targeted at people of color in the United States.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In the video above, you are introduced to leaders in the movement for justice and recognition of structural racism in our system. This structural racism allows for Black and Latino/a individuals (among others) to be incarcerated at much higher rates than whites. Statistics show us that 1 in 10 black men will have contact with the criminal justice system in the US during their lifetime.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>According to the US Bureau of Justice Statistics, 40 percent of the total prison population comprise of black individuals and approximately 20 percent are Latino/a. This means that 60% of the prison population, if not more, are black and brown people. Keep this extra piece of data in mind - black Americans comprise of 13% of the US population and Latinos/as are 16% of the total population, according to the 2010 Census.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>What does this mean? This means that people of color are disproportionately impacted by the racist practices of the criminal justice system. From the strategies used by police officers, the politicians public safety rhetoric, and the daily rise of men and women of color being locked up and not rehabilitated, we can see this disparity having real impacts on our community.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>According to the Southern Human Rights Center, ""The statistics are stark, but by now familiar: the United States has less than 5% of the world’s people, yet accounts for 25% of the world’s prisoners; the incarceration rate in the United States is seven times higher than the rate in Western Europe; more than 1 in 100 adults are behind bars today.""</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As Constance Malcolm stated, ""we need all sides of the story."" We know that institutions have greater access to the media, financial resources, and popular credibility due to their status and power. Because of this we only hear one side of the story. We read or hear, Officials say or Police Spokesperson said. Who speaks for the people who are falsely accused? Who speaks for the people who are unlawfully killed? Who speaks for the innocent who are only considered guilty due to bias and fear?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The status and power of the state distorts how we feel about their actions - especially when it has to do with low-income communities and communities of color. Mass incarceration has recently been brought to light by Michelle Alexander (2010) in The New Jim Crow. Historically, we have been blessed with the wisdom of Angela Davis, other activists, and intellectuals who have been able to translate this collective struggle of oppression in the United States.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>To contribute to this debate, and more importantly to help families across the US obtain justice, we will document the stories of the state's abuse of power. Whether it is mass incarceration, unjust policies that discriminate against marginalized groups, and police violence - families sit at the intersections of reality and hope because their stories present solutions. These solutions need to be heard.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>How will we spend the money raised?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We will use be funds to interview up to 20 families around the US who have experienced state violence. These stories (in multimedia formats) will be freely shared with each family as tools to help them win justice for their cases.

<h3>Update (July 9, 2013)</h3>
<p><strong>See App Camp in action!</strong> We posted a new campaign video here, with footage from the first week of camp. And we were also <a href=""(http:/www.katu.com/news/local/Software-company-owner-starts-app-camp-for-girls-214536511.html)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">featured on KATU News</a>, in a great feature with reporter Valerie Hurst. </p>
<p>For a firsthand account of volunteering, listen to designer and App Camp volunteer <a href=""http://twitter.com/antichrista"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Christa Mrgan</a> on <a href=""http://www.muleradio.net/thetalkshow/47/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Talk Show</a> with John Gruber. Towards the end of the show, she describes her experience working with the girls on interface and icon design. We are looking forward to having Christa back in August!</p>
<h3><strong>Update (July 3, 2013)</strong></h3>
<p>We just finished an amazing week! Twelve smart, creative girls participated in the App Camp “beta” session. We wanted to test out the program, and these girls agreed to be “guinea pigs” in exchange for waived camp tuition. (Read our latest Indiegogo update for more details!)</p>
<p>The girls loved it! “It’s a fun camp where you get to learn so much, meet amazing people, and build friendship and confidence.”</p>
<p>And so did their parents. “My daughter had a terrific time and was so inspired! Your camp has solidified her interest in a career as a computer programmer.”</p>
<p><strong>We are also very excited to be closing in on $75,000 in donations! Our stretch goal is $100,000.</strong> With the additional funds, we will accelerate our plans and expand the program beyond Portland in Summer 2014.</p>
<p><strong>Help us decide. When we make our new goal of $100,000, where should App Camp For Girls go next? Let us know in your comments!</strong></p>

<h2><strong>Why Apps? Why Girls? </strong></h2>
<p>App Camp for Girls wants to address the gender imbalance among software developers by giving girls the chance to learn how to build apps, to be inspired by women instructors, and to get exposure to software development as a career. Our goal is to grow our non-profit organization into a national force, with programs in multiple cities, helping thousands of girls.</p>
<p>We are launching this summer in Portland, Oregon. This summer, we'll be holding two sessions with girls 12-14 so that we can build and refine our curriculum. With experience and an established program, we'll move forward over the coming year with plans to expand the camp for Summer 2014 to accommodate more girls and a bigger age group, and to build the organization to reach beyond Portland to other cities.</p>
<h2>Where did we get this idea?</h2>
<p>Have you ever attended a tech conference and wondered, ""Where are all the women?"" That was founder Jean MacDonald's question. She attends an annual developer gathering with over 5000 attendees every year, and only a few hundred of them are women. Instead of feeling cranky about it, she tried to think of a positive way to address the imbalance.</p>
<p align=""center""><img alt=""Women use iPhone apps as much as men  do. Why aren't they developing them?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/846133/pictures/full/20130602120031-quote4.png?1370199633"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>As a volunteer and former board member at the Rock 'n' Roll Camp for Girls, Jean knew that <strong>amazing things happen when women mentors help girls see themselves in roles they had never imagined before</strong>. The camp started in Portland 12 years ago, and today there are girls rock camps around the world. App Camp For Girls is inspired by this model.</p>
<p align=""center""><img alt=""Girls Design Their Apps"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/846109/pictures/full/20130602114806-ui-stencils.jpg?1370198888"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>What have we done so far?</h2>
<p>In March, we held a one-day ""alpha"" camp with a small group to test out our plan to build an app with the girls in a short amount of time. It was a huge success. </p>
<p align=""center""><img alt=""Aysa's quote"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/844794/files/20130601153337-quote1.png?1370126017"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The highlight of the program for the girls was using the finished app on the iPhone. The feeling of accomplishment was clearly visible on their faces.</p>
<p>We are doing a ""beta"" camp (at no charge) June 24-28 with 12 girls to build on the success of the alpha camp and extend the program to a full week. Even with minimal outreach, we received beta camp applications from over 30 girls. We know the demand and need is there, and we know we have a program that is both engaging and inspiring. Our August regular session is scheduled to have 20 campers, and we already have girls signing up.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Our first ""beta"" session was a huge success. Check out our pitch video above to see the camp in action. We are focused now on making August even better!</p>
<h2><strong>What happens at App Camp?</strong></h2>
<p>The schedule at App Camp For Girls is equal parts geeky and fun. It's summer camp, after all! Girls are divided in to project teams, and the teams are led by a woman iOS developer with help from other women who are designers, testers, support specialists, and others.</p>
<p align=""center""><img alt=""Code counselor Natalie demonstrates Xcode"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/846155/pictures/full/20130602121256-natalie-teaches.jpg?1370200380"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The weeklong session covers the process from brainstorming an app idea to marketing the finished app. Girls will learn how to sketch out and storyboard their app ideas. The project team leaders will take the refined app storyboards and show the girls how apps are built in Xcode. The girls will have an opportunity for hands-on time with Xcode Storyboards and will learn how to customize the content of their app.</p>
<p align=""center""><img alt=""I learned what it takes to make an app"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/844813/files/20130601153848-quote2.png?1370126328"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In addition to developing their apps, the girls get to design icons and write App Store descriptions, while figuring out who their target market is. On the last day of camp, the teams will pitch their apps to a panel of women angel investors, giving them a chance to receive valuable feedback and learn more about the business side of app development.</p>
<p>Each day, we'll also have some physical activities with teachers coming in to do yoga, hula hooping, and self defense. Weather permitting (it is Oregon, of course), we can take advantage of the playground at TaborSpace where the camp is held and go on hikes in nearby Mt. Tabor Park. There will also be arts-and-crafts, button making, decorating iPhone cases and designing iPhone wallpaper.</p>
<p>The camp will provide an iPod touch for each girl to use. This will make it easy for the girls to learn by example, looking at current apps and how they work. The finished apps from each project team will be loaded on to all the iPod touches so the girls can see their apps on the device and get that sense of pride and excitement that comes with deploying your first app.</p>
<p align=""center""><img alt=""Girls Testing Their App"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/846099/pictures/full/20130602114605-app-testing.jpg?1370198769"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>What will the funds be used for?</h2>
<p>Our goal is to raise enough money to fund the first 12 months of building a non-profit nationwide program. We have the costs of launching the Summer 2013 App Camp with 32 girls over two sessions (June and August), as well as the costs of running the camp, expanding the program and doing outreach for the next 12 months. Some of the expenses include:</p>
<ul>
<li>iPod touches</li>
<li>MacBooks, backup drives and other accessories</li>
<li>venue rental</li>
<li>classroom equipment and projector</li>
<li>volunteer stipends</li>
<li>scholarships</li>
<li>design tools and art supplies</li>
<li>software: CRM, finance, presentation</li>
<li>website hosting</li>
<li>accounting and legal services</li>
<li>printing and t-shirts</li>
<li>snacks and lunches</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>We hit our target of $50,000 in just three days. We are now working toward our stretch goal of $100,000. The response to App Camp For Girls has been just amazing, and we often hear the question: ""When can you bring App Camp to our city?"" With the additional funding, we'll be able to bring the program to more girls in more cities by Summer 2014.</p>
<h2>How can you help?</h2>
<p>First and foremost, we welcome your dollars! There are hard costs associated both with launching and seeding a fruitful, long-term venture like this. (Did we mention we were thinking big? Lots of lost ground to make up for as far as creating gender balance and opportunity!)</p>
<p>Second, we'd love your help getting the word out about App Camp for Girls—both this fundraiser and the project in general. We can't be everywhere and we don't know everyone who'll want to be involved—yet, anyway—so we really need your help. Sharing on Facebook, Twitter, G+ or your favorite online or real-life networks of choice increases our chances of getting more girls in more camps making more apps. </p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>I am Teresa Gray, an undergraduate student at Western Oregon University; studying Criminal Justice with a minor in Homeland Security. In June 2014, I will be graduating with Honors and a Bachelor of Science degree. I am a fourth dan black belt in taekwondo and referee at most local tournaments; I am also a first lieutenant in the Civil Air Patrol, where my main job is to teach about drug resistance, and I also participate in emergency service activities-such a search and rescue.</p>
<p>It would be an amazing experience for me to be able to study criminal justice abroad at Bond University on the Gold Coast, Australia. Since applying for this opportunity, I often find myself day dreaming about all the things I could learn: about myself, Australia, another culture, and a foreign criminal justice system. It is no longer enough for me to someday visit the land down under; I need to learn everything about it- live it, breath it, explore it, study in it- the type of learning only a study abroad program could provide.</p>
<p>By supporting my endeavor, you will be helping me have an experience of a lifetime. Anyone who has ever studied abroad will tell you how it changed their life and was the best experience of their life. Fund my opportunity to change my life!</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get:</strong></p>
<p>This experience of a lifetime is very expensive but with your help I can make this daydream a reality. I will have to pay: $18,000 to the third party provider, CISabroad, which will pay for tuition and fees, housing, medical and accident insurance, academic/financial aid counseling, CISabroad Culture and Adventure Program, CISabroad support services before, during and after the program, assistance with travel arrangement, pre-departure/onsite orientation, airport pickup, official Bond University transcript, and carbon offset of travel and Green Travel Guide; personal expenses include $3,500 for meals, books and supplies, an International Student Identification Card, and other miscellaneous expenses; Visa fees of $565; Airfare and local transportation $2,500; Western Oregon University gets $580 for an application fee, administration fees, and Capstone Project Tuition (1 credit course); Passport with photo was $145. Keep in mind that this is a 15.5 week program in which I will be studying at a top rate university.</p>
<p>For your donation you can receive a cleaning cloth for your glasses or electronic devices, an origami crane, a Drug Demand Reduction carabineer key chain with an explanation of the program or a coupon for Dragon Financial, Inc.

</div></div>","Summary:
I am Teresa Gray, an undergraduate student at Western Oregon University; studying Criminal Justice with a minor in Homeland Security. In June 2014, I will be graduating with Honors and a Bachelor of Science degree. I am a fourth dan black belt in taekwondo and referee at most local tournaments; I am also a first lieutenant in the Civil Air Patrol, where my main job is to teach about drug resistance, and I also participate in emergency service activities-such a search and rescue.
It would be an amazing experience for me to be able to study criminal justice abroad at Bond University on the Gold Coast, Australia. Since applying for this opportunity, I often find myself day dreaming about all the things I could learn: about myself, Australia, another culture, and a foreign criminal justice system. It is no longer enough for me to someday visit the land down under; I need to learn everything about it- live it, breath it, explore it, study in it- the type of learning only a study abroad program could provide.
By supporting my endeavor, you will be helping me have an experience of a lifetime. Anyone who has ever studied abroad will tell you how it changed their life and was the best experience of their life. Fund my opportunity to change my life!
 
What I Need & What You Get:
This experience of a lifetime is very expensive but with your help I can make this daydream a reality. I will have to pay: $18,000 to the third party provider, CISabroad, which will pay for tuition and fees, housing, medical and accident insurance, academic/financial aid counseling, CISabroad Culture and Adventure Program, CISabroad support services before, during and after the program, assistance with travel arrangement, pre-departure/onsite orientation, airport pickup, official Bond University transcript, and carbon offset of travel and Green Travel Guide; personal expenses include $3,500 for meals, books and supplies, an International Student Identification Card, and other miscellaneous expenses; Visa fees of $565; Airfare and local transportation $2,500; Western Oregon University gets $580 for an application fee, administration fees, and Capstone Project Tuition (1 credit course); Passport with photo was $145. Keep in mind that this is a 15.5 week program in which I will be studying at a top rate university.
For your donation you can receive a cleaning cloth for your glasses or electronic devices, an origami crane, a Drug Demand Reduction carabineer key chain with an explanation of the program or a coupon for Dragon Financial, Inc. (DFI) services. www.dragonfinancial.com If you do not own your own business, DFI also accepts individual people/couples as clients. If you do not live in Oregon, that’s fine, DFI has a few out-of-state clients as well. Just tell them what you need, they will find a way to provide it.
If I do not reach my goal and am not able to study abroad, I will be sure to only use the money raised for educational purposes, such as tuition and textbooks. Don’t worry, you are just funding my education and that is always a good cause to support.
 
The Impact:
I am a very hard worker, dedicated, loyal, and do not do anything without giving it everything. I put a lot of hard work into my education and my life. By contributing to my education and life experiences, you are contributing to the WORLD. The impact I will make (and have already made) on the world will be positive and beneficial. I have found that I can make a bigger difference by knowing how others do things and how that can relate, improve, and benefit what we do.

<p><em> </em></p>
<h2><strong>The Story</strong></h2>
<h3>Did you know children in Kori-machi Fukushima are only allowed to play outside for 1hour because of the risk of radiation?</h3>
<p> And this is only one of the many side effects caused by the Nuclear Plant Melt Down in Fukushima. Well and truly the lives of people in Fukushima have been turned upside down.</p>
<p> Not only have children lost their homes, family and friends. Everyday they have to stress about radiation levels in the food they eat, the water they drink and the environment they play in.</p>
<p>No child should ever have to go through this!!</p>
<p>Let’s do something for these kids!!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<p>The TA project is inviting children from Fukushima for a 4day camp in Osaka from August 17<sup>th</sup> to 20<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>This is how we’re going to help.......</p>
<h3> <em><strong>Help the wider</strong></em><strong> communit</strong><strong>y</strong>
</h3>
<p>This is not just for the children, but for the hard working parents who are trying to survive, keep their children safe and fight against a nuclear free country all at the same time.</p>
<h3><strong>Help by giving them hope</strong></h3>
<p>The media might have stopped giving them attention but we want them to show them the world still cares.</p>
<h3><strong>Help by giving them back their childhood.</strong></h3>
<p>For the past 15months they haven’t had much time to ENJOY life and have FUN.</p>
<h3><strong><em>Help by giving them courage</em> </strong></h3>
<p>Heck we’re not perfect but we want to be good role models for these kids. Teach them how to be strong and show them how to deal with difficult times.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>We need your help <br/></strong></h2>
<p>We’re not planning on putting on some extravagant Puff Daddy style party. But we want to put on a camp where the children feel inspired. We want to give them courage, hope, love, memories and the opportunity for them to be kids again.</p>
<p>Although we’ve been working our butts off raising funds through events, flea markets,music events and donation boxes, we REALLY need a hand.</p>
<h3>TA is an ongoing project, this camp is not a one off but we want to invite children from Fukushima every year for these camps!!</h3>

<p><strong>We will spend 5 nights in the USA - visiting sights such as the Golden Gate Bridge, Cisco HQ and possibly even Twitter HQ.</strong></p>
<p>This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for the us and this experience will have a positive impact on our lives in the future.</p>

<div class=""text_exposed_root text_exposed"" id=""id_519925668d8666214796190"">I want to share with you a very exciting ministry work I will be starting in August next year and asking you to consider how you may be able to support me in this work. I will begin serving with a Catholic Youth Ministry called NET Ministries (NET) which is a ministry directed towards secondary school students, third level students and young working people. <br/>During the past six years NET has served many dioceses throughout Ireland, positively impacting on the lives of some 30 000 young people. One of the di<span class=""text_exposed_show"">stinguishing features of a NET team is that it is made up of young (18-30 year old) people. It is young Catholics who take up the challenge of presenting the Catholic faith to others in a way that is meaningful to them and helps them to see its relevance in their daily lives. <br/>Young people today are becoming complacent, and many young Catholics are leaving the Catholic Church to go to other churches that they find more inviting. Catholic youth need Good News. They need to hear it from their Church and they need to see its reality experienced and lived out in the lives of their peers. The Second Vatican Council states that ‘young people ought to be the first apostles to the young’ which is what NET Ministries is all about. <br/>Following five weeks of training, the teams embark on ten months of ministry to the youth of Ireland. Teams present the Gospel message in a clear manner, challenging young people to place God first in their lives and help them develop concrete ways they can grow in their faith. Young people need to hear a clear proclamation of the Gospel. They need to know that God loves them and cares about their lives. They need to know that the Church needs them and that they need the Church. <br/>That is what I am committed to share. But I need your support! I seek your support in the form of prayer. I need people praying for me to give me the courage and strength necessary for this exciting ministry. I also invite you to support me financially. I am committed to raising 6,000 dollars, prior to beginning my work with NET Ministries. While this amount does not cover the full expenditure during my time with NET the total cost is approx. 16,000 dollars. it is a very valuable investment in a better future for thousands of young people. This money will be used to provide me with a personal stipend, training in youth evangelization, formation in Christian character, countless opportunities to share my faith, food, accommodation, medical cover, pastoral supervision, ministry supplies and over 5 weeks training intensives. Each of my teammates will also be raising the same amount. <br/>As part of being on my support team I look forward to keeping you informed about the impact your support is having and give you peace of mind by showing that many young people will experience the Good News, and thousands of Catholic youth will become more engaged in their church and community life. <br/><span>Please prayerfully consider supporting me and the ministry with prayer and financial support. If you are willing to donate, please get in contact with me so I can send you as much information as possible on everything going on! Your support gives the ‘green light’ for my Ministry work with NET. </span></span>

<h3>Hello!</h3>
<p>My name is Jenny and I am a junior in high school. Alex is my brother. I have made it my mission to help Alex raise part of the funds for his trip to Japan. Alex is your average 7th grade boy. His perfect afternoon would consist of watching his favorite animes and playing Street Fighter. He likes video games, anime, trading cards, and all things technology. And on top of everything, he has a great interest in Asian culture.</p>
<p>When Alex expressed interest in traveling to Japan with his school through the annual Kawakami - Watsonville Sister City trip, I was thrilled. Our mom and I were delightedly surprised to see Alex aspire to go on such a trip. It makes sense because many of the things he likes originate in Japan. He talks a lot about Japanese culture and often says Japanese phrases to me that I don't understand.</p>
<p>Alex will be visiting Tokyo and Kawakami village, a Japanese amusement park, and various other sightseeing places. In Kawakami, Alex will be staying with a host family and will be attending the local middle school. Alex has studied Japanese customs and plans to take Japanese language classes taught by a KWSCA volunteer. He is very enthusiastic about his trip to Japan and is willing to go the extra mile to make sure he is prepared.</p>
<p>The KWSCA holds meetings for the group of amazing students traveling to Japan every month. Our mother has to work, so she cannot attend some meetings. I take Alex to the meetings in her place, since our father is disabled and would have difficulty coming. I really want Alex to be able to go on this trip because I want to prove to him that nothing can hold him back from doing things he wants to do. It is something that I have lived by for most of my life and I would like to pass this message down to him; that anything is possible if you have enough determination.</p>
<p>The trip costs about $1100 give or take a hundred or two, depending on plane ticket prices and hotel choices. We have already paid the $100 deposit and the first $300 installment. Alex will be participating in all other fundraising oppertunities offered by the KWSCA including a pancake breakfast and a car wash. $500 would cover half of the roundtrip ticket. Any other money from the other fundraisers would go towards bus fare, meals, entry fees to recreational places, and the other costs associated with the trip. </p>
<p>I truly hope that you consider contributing to Alex's trip to Japan. If you have any questions feel free to drop a comment and I will answer back as soon as possible. The KWSCA is a non-profit, so your donation may be tax refundable if you wish. Thank you for reading and please share this page with a friend!</p>

They are shared via our <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/smartstoriesuk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">YouTube channel</a> and have worksheets linked to be used by children to expand their understanding. Our channel also collects <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/smartstoriesUK/playlists"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">playlists</a> of writing stimuli from around the internet, based on different themes. We also support and share resources and ideas about children's literacy on our <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/smartstories"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook page</a>.  <br/></p>
<p>Our flexible <b>writing workshops</b> revolve around the use of film, green screen, costume, drama, and sound recording. We provide the first steps into an imagined world, carefully resourced to give children the necessary experience to develop their own stories. Across a single day, the children can plan, write, star in, narrate, and provide sound effects for their own short film. Each section of the workshop focuses on improving their writing, widening their vocabulary, inspiring a love for stories and giving them a reason to write.  We know of no other companies that offer this service. </p>

<blockquote><b>“Stories can conquer fear, you know. They can make the heart bigger.” <br/>― Ben Okri</b></blockquote>
<p>Many children find writing challenging. They may not see writing as important or  useful for their lives. They can lack experience to fuel imagination which means they may not remain captivated by sustained writing. Two thirds of 100 primary school teachers we spoke to, told us their children struggle to use their imagination and come up with ideas. We strive to support children to develop these skills through our work. </p>
<p>This is important because literacy and story writing;</p>
<ul>
<li>opens children's eyes to new people, places, or new ways of thinking which they might not otherwise encounter</li>
<li>gives children a safe space to explore their own emotions and reactions to the world around them</li>
<li>creates a positive attitude to creativity and less fear of failure</li>
<li>creates satisfaction in being able to manipulate language to craft something beautiful or to express an idea </li>
<li>enables children to communicate more confidently and clearly in written and verbal ways.</li>
</ul>
<ul></ul>
<p>We want to transform creative writing from a daunting task into something children look forward to and take pleasure and satisfaction from throughout their lives. Through acting out and physically taking part in their own stories we give children a clear incentive to experiment with new ideas and test language outside of their comfort zone.</p>

<h4>1. Who are you?</h4>
<div>We are qualified primary school teachers with over 10 years combined classroom experience. We have shared knowledge of teaching all ages, from Reception to Year 6. Our passion is working with children and finding ways to make writing exciting.</div>
<h4><b><b>2. Who are your workshops suitable for?</b></b></h4>

<div>We will be running our workshop based on theme, rather than genre. Our first theme will be 'Pirates!' which is easily adapted to suit various genres; adventure, fantasy, mystery, and contains opportunities to use interesting vocabulary, characters and settings.

</div></div>","“After nourishment, shelter and companionship, stories are the thing we need most in the world.” ― Philip Pullman

Welcome to Smart Stories! Smart Stories is the creation of two teachers who take the roles of Rufus and Reginald Write, travelling brothers who aim to preserve and protect stories and in doing so support children and teachers by inspiring a love of crafting them.
Aims:




Inspire a love of stories by creating free story writing videos and resources to be used in schools.


Visit schools to provide workshops for children and teachers - giving them 'A Reason to Write'.


Become ambassadors for the importance of children's literacy and and for the power of stories to improve lives.




Our free video resources are a mixture of modelling, explanation and tips, presented by Rufus and Reginald in an engaging and exciting way. They are shared via our YouTube channel and have worksheets linked to be used by children to expand their understanding. Our channel also collects playlists of writing stimuli from around the internet, based on different themes. We also support and share resources and ideas about children's literacy on our Facebook page.  
Our flexible writing workshops revolve around the use of film, green screen, costume, drama, and sound recording. We provide the first steps into an imagined world, carefully resourced to give children the necessary experience to develop their own stories. Across a single day, the children can plan, write, star in, narrate, and provide sound effects for their own short film. Each section of the workshop focuses on improving their writing, widening their vocabulary, inspiring a love for stories and giving them a reason to write.  We know of no other companies that offer this service. 

As qualified teachers we understand what schools, children and other teachers need for high quality education.  
We have both been inventing and shaping exciting characters in our classrooms for a few years. Reginald and Rufus Write are special. They are brilliant at enthusing children to learn. Combining these characters with our knowledge of the new curriculum, enthusiasm for storytelling, use of technology and numerous props and costumes make for an explosive learning experience.  

We are Smart Stories, and we are hugely excited about the opportunity to enthuse children and inspire a love of writing. With your help we plan to purchase the resources we need to visit schools and provide children with a 'Reason to Write'.




“Stories can conquer fear, you know. They can make the heart bigger.” ― Ben Okri
Many children find writing challenging. They may not see writing as important or  useful for their lives. They can lack experience to fuel imagination which means they may not remain captivated by sustained writing. Two thirds of 100 primary school teachers we spoke to, told us their children struggle to use their imagination and come up with ideas. We strive to support children to develop these skills through our work. 
This is important because literacy and story writing;

opens children's eyes to new people, places, or new ways of thinking which they might not otherwise encounter
gives children a safe space to explore their own emotions and reactions to the world around them
creates a positive attitude to creativity and less fear of failure
creates satisfaction in being able to manipulate language to craft something beautiful or to express an idea 
enables children to communicate more confidently and clearly in written and verbal ways.


We want to transform creative writing from a daunting task into something children look forward to and take pleasure and satisfaction from throughout their lives. Through acting out and physically taking part in their own stories we give children a clear incentive to experiment with new ideas and test language outside of their comfort zone.



 We have already put our own funds into purchasing some of the core resources for our workshops. However we need your contributions to be able to launch our workshops so we can begin supporting children and teachers in story writing. This will go towards funding, among other things:

Creating free resources for schools that promote of the importance of children's literacy 
Props and writing resources
Costumes for children to immerse themselves in a role
Portable green screen equipment and lighting
Video and sound recording devices 
Technology for green screen and video editing
Data storage
Transportation for school visits


If we were to raise more than £10,000 we would use the extra contributions to enable us to expand immediately into new themes for children to base their stories around, which you can read more about below.




Costume designs created by Laura Wisner for our initial pirate themed workshop.

4. What will happen in a typical workshop?
All parts of the workshop will have a strong focus on story and character development, the enjoyment of literacy, and strengthening confidence in exploring language. Children will spend a full day creating, writing, and filming their own stories.
A visit from Rufus and Reginald, for one class, includes:

I experienced severe neck and shoulder pain that would not go away, and at times I felt confused, disoriented. 3 days prior going to ER I felt nausea and experienced severe vomiting. Before I went to the ER, I knew something was seriously wrong, yet I tried to tell myself it would go away by itself.

Summary



My name is Alexandra Hewardt and I will be launching HelpingHandCrowd.com, an online fundraising community helping families and friends fund costly medical care for their loved ones. Between now and and July 15 2014, we are reaching out to incredible people like you to help us raise $10,000 through indigogo to build this community and save many patients from medical care bills distress. All funds will go to support in building this community and launching it so that we can start helping those in need.


How is Helping Hand Crowd different from other fundraising communities?
Our online fundraising community ensures that raised funds are used for their intended purpose. Donor confidence and payment transparency is crucial. When you raise money through Helping Hand Crowd, donors are assured that the contributions will go directly to their medical providers.

<p>
</p><p>Thanks to the amazing staff at Shaker Heights High School, I have the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to go on a service trip to Cambodia. </p>
<p>My social studies teacher at my high school (and world traveler on the side) <b>Ms. Ahrens </b>has set up an incredible trip for a lucky dozen people for<b> one week over</b> <b>this spring break. </b>She has been to Cambodia several times before, and has been inspired by her experiences to teach the Human Rights and Conflicts course at my high school and to set up this program.

<p>
</p><p>At the heart of the trip are two goals: <b>service and culture immersion.</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>We will be traveling to two major <b>cities</b>: Phnom Phen and Siem Reap, both beautiful and buzzing with culture. There, we will be exploring the major things that the cities have to offer: restaurants, local artisan’s shops, and lots of markets, most notably, Siem Reap’s world-famous Night Market. </p>
<p>We will also visiting some of Cambodia’s most important <b>historical sites</b>, such as the Killing Fields and the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum. It is important that we understand the roots of the culture and the turmoil of the country’s past to be able to understand where it is today. Other sites we will be exploring include Siem Reap’s temples and Angkor Wat, perhaps the most famous in Southeast Asia. </p>
<p>Later, we will travel to Prek Toal, the floating village where we will be doing our <b>service work</b> and doing home stays for two nights. The service includes building badly-needed structures, repairing anything that needs fixing, helping the villagers fish, cook, clean, etc. We will also be building water purification systems so that the villagers have access to clean water. When we are not building, we will be interacting with the villagers and their children, playing and giving lessons in english and math, and seeing how they live their everyday lives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ever since I first heard about the trip, I knew that this was the right one for me. I was also offered the opportunity to go with the Shaker Heights choir and orchestra to tour in Austria and Hungary this upcoming spring. As amazing as I’m sure that trip would be (staying in over-the-top hotels, being bussed from place to place, having lots of time to shop for souvenirs, etc.), I turned it down because I felt that the trip to Cambodia would be more rewarding. As Ms. Ahrens keeps stressing, “we are learning to be travelers, not tourists”.</p>

</p><p><b>Why contribute?</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been babysitting and doing odd jobs as much as possible since the summer to help pay for the trip. A major component of this trip is the idea of making sacrifices for something that is truly worthwhile, and weighing what we really<i> need</i> vs. what we want in the moment. In the spirit of the trip, the group has been fundraising like crazy and motivating each other toward our common goal. </p>
<p>I have raised a good deal of the funds that I need in this way, but I can’t do it alone. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The cost of the trip is about $3200, which covers the airfare, service fees, hotel rooms, and most meals. I wholeheartedly believe that every sacrifice I have made thus far has been worth it, and am still working hard toward my goal. </p>

The tour company that we are using is Rustic Pathways, an extremely trustworthy company that specializes in both adventure and service-based trips in the less-developed parts of Asia and Africa. An itinerary and overview of the trip in their words is here:
http://rusticpathways.com/programs/floating-village-service-expedition-2/

Why contribute?

I have been babysitting and doing odd jobs as much as possible since the summer to help pay for the trip. A major component of this trip is the idea of making sacrifices for something that is truly worthwhile, and weighing what we really need vs. what we want in the moment. In the spirit of the trip, the group has been fundraising like crazy and motivating each other toward our common goal. 
I have raised a good deal of the funds that I need in this way, but I can’t do it alone. 

The cost of the trip is about $3200, which covers the airfare, service fees, hotel rooms, and most meals. I wholeheartedly believe that every sacrifice I have made thus far has been worth it, and am still working hard toward my goal. 

With your support, I can turn this trip into a reality.
If possible, please share this page so that it gets as much exposure as it can. Every little bit counts.

Perks!

When I return from Cambodia, I will share my experiences by creating a blog where I will post photos and recount stories from my time there. I will be regularly updating the blog with stories detailing how the trip is impacting my life back home, as I’m certain it will.

Our Fundraising Goal & Perks
Our goal is to raise $20,000 to assist with teacher salaries. Every little bit counts. 



Being a small school in a mission Diocese, we are not able to pay the same salaries as public schools.  We are blessed to have dedicated teachers who believe in the mission of the schools. Our board is actively trying to reduce the gap between the salaries we offer and public school salaries.
 From a ""shout out"" on Facebook to a microwave or door dedicated in your name, we have wonderful ""thank yous.""  Take for instance the homemade peppermint bark (perfect for this holiday season) or a Christmas tree ornament.

  


The Impact
The Catholic Schools of Fairbanks offers not only a solid education but also an education founded on Jesus.  
From stories of children thriving in higher education and in life beyond schooling, to students becoming so excited about Christ that they start bringing their parents to Church (resulting in multiple new families become baptized each year), the impact of these schools reaches deep into the community.

<b><br/></b><p><b>Sakalakawe</b>l is a community school in Oban, just outside of Jacmel.
Together with the committed citizens of the community of Oban, and
participation coming from the four corners of the country to take advantage of the opportunity in a building training inspired by Earthship Biotecture, we carry on with the construction of a multi-disciplinary cultural
amphitheatre which will be self-sufficient in water and electricity. It's base will be made mostly of recycled materials.<br/></p>

<br/>
But that’s not all! This construction will also serve as a training ground for members of the Haitian building association, ATECO. Together, Vladimir Bely
(Haitian trainer/site supervisor who has become an expert in eco-building),
myself and ATECO now form a branch of alternative building to respond to the
growing demand in Haiti. </p>
<p>The shape of the building is inspired by an Earthship model
(the Flower design) which has been built twice in Africa. We simplified this
model to give it 2 classrooms, 2 bathrooms and a performance stage. It is an
amphitheater, dug directly into the mountain. The benches will be dug by hand into the hill of the mountain, giving a view of the stage, and the sea Jacmel.<br/>
<br/>
A large quantity of materials will be gathered from the streets, ravines and beaches
to be recycled and used for the build, like tires, plastic and glass bottles, Styrofoam..</p>
<p>The land used is family-owned and belongs to Dieudonné
Cyprien, a pillar in his community and in the continuation of our community
school which bears the name of Sakalakawel. He directs the Sakalakawel soccer
team, and supervises programs and activities.<br/>

Don’t forget to consult the photos and videos by clicking on

What we need

The collected funds will buy tools, construction
materials, pay for transporting recycled materials as well as expenses linked
to the creation of an infrastructure that will provide adequate training for ATECO
and participants coming from other zones of the country.
The building of Sakalakawel will move
forward at the pace of the energy put into it by its participants and collaborators.
If the financial objectives are not met, the construction will go on with the ressources available on a longer-term basis
We hope to gather enough funds to
complete one of the two classrooms/bathrooms, one of the two botanical cells (which
will create an autonomous water supply), the performance stage, and the benches.
This will allow the school to resume
its activities from April 2014. The previous space used was rented and was
interrupted last January 2014 due to an increase in rent.
This campaign is a search for funds
on the Canadian side. I (Marita Mariasine) will be responsible for efficiently allocating
these funds to the project, in a way that also contributes
to the local economy.
Sakalakawel is a cornerstone in the sustainable
building movement in Haiti and is creating local avenues for the decentralization of water and electricity.
It will continue to be a place where
the community can meet, create, learn and grow. Once this stage of the build is
achieved, Sakalakawel will be an amphitheatre able to seat 400 people attending community events and multidisciplinary artistic exchanges! It will be and already is a central point where the
community can impart values and knowledge for several generations to come, through
its numerous activities.



Challenges

Sakalakawel currently displays as its
physical infrastructure a building under construction on a virgin piece
of land. Because of this we are unfortunately not yet ready to host large
groups of people coming from outside the country wishing to benefit from this
training in Biotecture and this unique experience. Certain special arrangements can be
made. 
We are putting all the energy we can into creating a training site and community camp site for Haitians coming from
other zones of the country, who require a place to sleep, bathe and cook, near
the work site.

We are a group of four students from The University of Tennessee, Knoxville who have taken on the task of raising money for JA BizTown of East Tennessee. All the donations we receive from this campaign will go directly to help JA BizTown by allowing three classrooms to spend a day there. Our group has decided to raise a goal of $1,500. This amount of money could help send three elementary/sixth grade classrooms through the JA BizTown Our Community program.</p><h2>What is JA Biztown?       </h2><p>Junior Achievement of East Tennessee is a non-profit organization whose goal is to ""inspire and prepare young people to succeed in a global economy"" (<a href=""http://www.jaeasttennessee.org/about/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.jaeasttennessee.org/about/</a>).</p><p>Located in Clinton, Tennessee JA BizTown of East Tennessee is expected to impact the lives of over 8,500; 4th, 5th, or 6th grade students in 2018 alone. Before the kids get to go to the BizTown facility though, they must go through a five week classroom program where leaders from JA BizTown teach the instructors of each classroom exactly what the students need to learn before spending a day at the facility. The students are taught tasks such as: taxes, how to vote, and how businesses and governments can help shape a community.</p><h2>Why are We Raising Money?</h2><p>While BizTown is a great experience for kids, many schools and school districts can not afford to have this experience without the help of funding. As a full non-profit, BizTown uses major sponsors such as Chick-fil-a, Pilot, and Clayton Investments along with smaller donations given from campaigns like this to help keep JA of East Tennessee successfully running. It is important that JA BizTown stays running because this brings hope and excitement for the students futures. Some children will never be able to experience a day in BizTown. The donations that we receive will allow JA BizTown to help provide scholarships for the schools that cannot afford to pay. The cost per each school is $500.00 total. So by helping us raise $1,500.00, we will be helping three schools.</p><h2>Who Do We Plan on Reaching?</h2><p>The other part of JA is that it relies on support from the general public. This includes anyone from teachers, to politicians, to parents who want to see their students/children succeed in the future. We are hoping for an impact to this audience because we feel they will believe in the lives of their children's futures. This support helps JA BizTown provide a wonderful learning experience for children who can greatly benefit from the real world experience. This is what drives JA BizTown, real world experiences.  </p><h2>What is JA BizTown like?</h2><p>The facility is set with many real world, well-known companies outlining a large area. The students are then hired through the classroom program they go through before coming to BizTown and they spend the day working for these companies. They allow the children to work many different jobs. These vary from Chick Fil A, to City Hall, to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Another aspect of this program is by teaching the children use of salaries. The students work for their paychecks and get paid twice a day. Each company has different salaries. The students are allowed to use them during their break at lunch and go to different companies and purchase items with the money they have made. For example, some items such as, cookies, sunglasses, stuffed animals, or JA BizTown t-shirts.</p><h2>How will we be rewarding donors?  </h2><p>These wonderful programs are what allow JA Biztown to be successful in teaching real world experiences while providing a fun and safe environment. They are only able to achieve such a goal with help from donations. That’s why we decided to provide certain perks to accommodate different sizes of donations. For instance if you donate one dollar you will get a shoutout with a virtual high-five, if you donate five dollars you will be rewarded with a JA BizTown pen, and if you’re just so generous to give twenty-five dollars you will be rewarded with a JA BizTown t-shirt. We are wanting to create neat incentives to give with our donors so they remember what they donated and what they received from us.</p><p>We would all like to thank you for your consideration in donating to our Campaign. If you have specific questions for us or for JA Biztown, please contact: Travis Aikman, taikman@vols.utk.edu or Callie Archer, JA BizTown President: callie@jaeasttennessee.org.</p></div>","Who We Are     Foremost, we would like to thank you for visiting our start-up campaign.

The donations that we receive will allow JA BizTown to help provide scholarships for the schools that cannot afford to pay. The cost per each school is $500.00 total. So by helping us raise $1,500.00, we will be helping three schools.Who Do We Plan on Reaching?The other part of JA is that it relies on support from the general public. This includes anyone from teachers, to politicians, to parents who want to see their students/children succeed in the future. We are hoping for an impact to this audience because we feel they will believe in the lives of their children's futures. This support helps JA BizTown provide a wonderful learning experience for children who can greatly benefit from the real world experience. This is what drives JA BizTown, real world experiences.  What is JA BizTown like?The facility is set with many real world, well-known companies outlining a large area. The students are then hired through the classroom program they go through before coming to BizTown and they spend the day working for these companies. They allow the children to work many different jobs. These vary from Chick Fil A, to City Hall, to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Another aspect of this program is by teaching the children use of salaries. The students work for their paychecks and get paid twice a day. Each company has different salaries. The students are allowed to use them during their break at lunch and go to different companies and purchase items with the money they have made. For example, some items such as, cookies, sunglasses, stuffed animals, or JA BizTown t-shirts.How will we be rewarding donors?  These wonderful programs are what allow JA Biztown to be successful in teaching real world experiences while providing a fun and safe environment. They are only able to achieve such a goal with help from donations. That’s why we decided to provide certain perks to accommodate different sizes of donations. For instance if you donate one dollar you will get a shoutout with a virtual high-five, if you donate five dollars you will be rewarded with a JA BizTown pen, and if you’re just so generous to give twenty-five dollars you will be rewarded with a JA BizTown t-shirt. We are wanting to create neat incentives to give with our donors so they remember what they donated and what they received from us.We would all like to thank you for your consideration in donating to our Campaign. If you have specific questions for us or for JA Biztown, please contact: Travis Aikman, taikman@vols.utk.edu or Callie Archer, JA BizTown President: callie@jaeasttennessee.org.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

By providing workshops and technical training, we create leadership opportunities, cultivate a supportive community of peers and mentors, and encourage social change and the development of life skills.”</span></p>
<p> Our 2013 Summer Session marked our fifth anniversary!</p>
<p>What Happens At Camp?</p>
We provide a supportive space for 30-35 female youth to help build self-esteem through music creation and performance. Throughout the week, campers learn a key instrument and are coached through the experience of playing within a band setting. Campers also attend workshops with talented female mentors in subjects such as Songwriting, Self-Defense, Image and Identity, Zine-Making, Screen-Printing and Gear Education including gear set up and maintenance.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Also happening at camp are performances by experienced female musicians, on-site conflict management for bands, and one on one instrument instruction sessions with the youth.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We are a social justice based organization and achieve some of our goals through:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>a low barrier, sliding scale tuition rate so families and guardians can choose what they can afford. No one is ever turned away for lack of funds.</li>
<li>providing delicious and nutritious warm lunches to campers and volunteers as well as snacks, every day.</li>
</ul>
<br/>The week finishes with the ultimate experience of playing a live show at the multi-purpose Rio Theatre, in front of an audience of family, friends and screaming fans.</div>
<div>
<br/>We are a member of the <a href=""http://girlsrockcampalliance.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">GRCA</a>, an international coalition of Rock Camps. <br/><h3><em>Why are we fundraising?</em></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Girls Rock Camp Vancouver's 2013 Summer Camp session filled within a week. Our waitlist filled a day after that, it always does.</p>
<p>As we finish out fifth year of programming we feel the obvious need for stable, affordable, year round programming and (hopefully), another camp session each year.</p>
<p>We are 100% volunteer driven and our unpaid organizing crew spends thousands of hours a year striving to make this the funnest, most rewarding experience for both campers and volunteers. To be honest, we're a bit tired and we need your help taking the edge off of worrying about cash flow, and running into financial barriers when trying to move forward with partnerships and programs.</p>
Money raised will help us to:</div>
<ul>
<li>Build a new website so we can maximize efficiency and communications.</li>
<li>Provide capital so that we can invest in community partnerships immediately, without worrying about how we will pay for it. This will allow us to reach as many youth as possible in the lower mainland.</li>
<li>Continue providing full meals during camp.</li>
<li>Continue to be a low-barrier camp with a completely sliding scale tuition fee.</li>
</ul>
<p>*Please note that while we are a registered non-profit society in British Columbia, we are NOT a registered charity and cannot issue tax receipts.</p>

“Girls Rock Camp Vancouver is a non-profit society that builds self esteem in female youth through music creation and performance. By providing workshops and technical training, we create leadership opportunities, cultivate a supportive community of peers and mentors, and encourage social change and the development of life skills.”
 Our 2013 Summer Session marked our fifth anniversary!
What Happens At Camp?
We provide a supportive space for 30-35 female youth to help build self-esteem through music creation and performance. Throughout the week, campers learn a key instrument and are coached through the experience of playing within a band setting. Campers also attend workshops with talented female mentors in subjects such as Songwriting, Self-Defense, Image and Identity, Zine-Making, Screen-Printing and Gear Education including gear set up and maintenance.
 
Also happening at camp are performances by experienced female musicians, on-site conflict management for bands, and one on one instrument instruction sessions with the youth.
 
We are a social justice based organization and achieve some of our goals through:


a low barrier, sliding scale tuition rate so families and guardians can choose what they can afford. No one is ever turned away for lack of funds.
providing delicious and nutritious warm lunches to campers and volunteers as well as snacks, every day.

The week finishes with the ultimate experience of playing a live show at the multi-purpose Rio Theatre, in front of an audience of family, friends and screaming fans.

We are a member of the GRCA, an international coalition of Rock Camps. Why are we fundraising?


Girls Rock Camp Vancouver's 2013 Summer Camp session filled within a week. Our waitlist filled a day after that, it always does.
As we finish out fifth year of programming we feel the obvious need for stable, affordable, year round programming and (hopefully), another camp session each year.
We are 100% volunteer driven and our unpaid organizing crew spends thousands of hours a year striving to make this the funnest, most rewarding experience for both campers and volunteers. To be honest, we're a bit tired and we need your help taking the edge off of worrying about cash flow, and running into financial barriers when trying to move forward with partnerships and programs.
Money raised will help us to:

Build a new website so we can maximize efficiency and communications.
Provide capital so that we can invest in community partnerships immediately, without worrying about how we will pay for it. This will allow us to reach as many youth as possible in the lower mainland.
Continue providing full meals during camp.
Continue to be a low-barrier camp with a completely sliding scale tuition fee.

*Please note that while we are a registered non-profit society in British Columbia, we are NOT a registered charity and cannot issue tax receipts.
Perks!

For $20 we'll send you a thank you card and a really big tote bag with the 2013 logo, designed by Lindsey Hampton! Plus, we'll thank you on our site.
For $50, Aili Meutzner will do a drawing of your cat's aura. Intriguing! Also, we'll send you a card and thank you on our site.

For $100 you'll get a Fruitz watch in the ""grape"" colour scheme, a card from us, and a thanks on the site. It's worth $225 and we only have one!   (Donated kindly by the Watch It! store)

</h3>
<p></p>
<p>PGR, a non-partisan 501(c)(4), was founded in 2013 by two college
students at Miami University in order to educate and engage apathetic college
students on the fiscal issues such as debt, deficit, and tax reform.
Specifically advocating for fiscal responsibility. PGR is bridging the gap
between apathetic young voters and the political process. Educating students
across the nation in ways that are captivating, relatable, and fun, PGR  demonstrates how fiscal responsibility can
positively impact our future. </p>
<p>Project Green Room is a catalyst for college students to get
involved on these issues and a vehicle to advance our generation's ideas into
reality. By staying indifferent on the social issues, we make it easier for
college students to engage on these issues without having to sift through party
lines. Through social media, engaging speakers, events such as happy hours,
online marketing, and grassroots efforts, PGR will guide a generation's
political will to fix the fiscal problems we face. <br/></p>

<p>
</p><p>This became our quest, to develop a

In

training for adults helps refugees get back on their feet when they
return home by developing competences that allow them to build a
better future. Yet experience has shown that small refugee
populations receiving little support, often prove capable of
developing some sort of sustainability within a reasonably short
amount of time. Equally, the UN reports that refugees with an

THAT GIVES REFUGEES A TICKET FOR A BETTER FUTURE

60
million people worldwide are displaced against their will. Many end
up in camps and stay there on average for 12 years according to the
UNHCR.

Most
countries only allow temporary settlements hence no fixed buildings.
That's why millions of displaced people have to survive in tents and
without access to adequate schools or medical wards.

The
best way to give displaced people in camps a new beginning is
providing them access to adequate shelter, education and health. 


In
order to tackle this we needed a new approach and a new concept.
International shelter experts of leading organisations, civil
engineers, architects, researchers and many professionals joined us
in the quest for a low-cost innovative solution. 
WHAT WE NEEDWe need 37K Euro (or about 41K USD) to produce a real scale model in a real environment that will be used for final evaluations and accreditation. This real scale model will be donated to a community centre for young refugees without parents or guardianship.After 14 months of research, development, simulations, prototyping, evaluations by shelter experts and testing, we are ready to start a production line that will deliver our solution at low cost so we can make that crucial difference for many forcibly displaced people. Your contribution will help get maggie to market.WE NEED THIS CROWDFUNDING CAMPAIGN BECAUSE WE WANT TO BRING THESE SHELTERS TO THE MARKET AT COST. RIGHT NOW!Millions of displaced people will endure extreme cold during the winter because all they have are tents. Snow and frost is a reality in many refugee camps and can have long-term detrimental affects on health.It’s a key reason why displaced people have a disproportionately high rate of mortality, diseases and mental illness. Almost half of all displaced people are in a state of extreme vulnerability. A number of the causes for diseases amongst refugees are preventable by providing basic protection against the elements.EXPERTS SAY THIS IS A CRITICAL GAME-CHANGERUntil now, we've been stuck with tents because most countries do not allow permanent settlements. So we challenged the status quo and designed a shelter that is not permanent yet has all the virtues of a modern building. We did field assessments, researched climatic conditions and studied materials available near refugee camps. We listed the elements that cause discomfort, looked at the contributing factors and set measurable targets. Some of the targets are the same as school buildings in Belgium. Next, we set out to address all the shortcomings of tents, one-by-one, 30 different criteria in total.

The
result is Maggie - a sturdy shelter that you can set up within a day
and fill up the next day with local materials to create optimal
temperatures (between 16 - 27 c°) with little or no need for
additional cooling or heating.A
key advantage of the maggie shelter is that free and readily
available materials like sand, organic materials or plastic waste can
be used for insulation and stability. These features help keep
purchase and transport costs down.

<h3>Don't send food; it only lasts a day.  Please send us education; it lasts a lifetime!</h3>

<p>After the earthquake in 2010, everyone wanted to help Haiti.  Maybe you, like many others, sent a donation.  But perhaps you wondered, would your contribution really make any lasting difference?  How could you be sure that your money would be used effectively and not wasted?</p>
<p>In Ganthier, <a href=""http://www.foundationforpeace.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Foundation For Peace</a> (FFP) did not presume to tell the Haitians what they needed; we asked. The Ganthier provincial government responded that there was no vocational school in the entire region, and they desperately needed one to lift themselves out of poverty.  They were willing to donate five acres of land if FFP would build an educational complex there.  Community members have said that the educational complex is ""<strong>the answer to our prayers.</strong>"" Many will literally walk several miles from their home to the site, just to volunteer their labor. The vocational school is aptly named ""Lekòl Pwofesyonèl Men nan Men"" (Hand-in-Hand Professional School).</p>

<p>If you want to do more than just donate a few dollars towards temporary relief, and want to be part of a long-term solution, then supporting the construction of this school is one of the best ways we know of doing it.</p>

<h2>What We Need</h2>
<p><img alt=""Building the roof of the first floor"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://math.mit.edu/~tchow/haiti2/workers2.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""Building the roof of the first floor""/>Volunteer missions teams are expected to provide about $100,000 in 2013 towards the completion of the school building. However, we need funds to pay Haitian workers to continue the construction when volunteers are not around. <strong>The estimated cost of labor for the second floor of the school building is $30,000</strong>, and that is what we are aiming to raise with the current campaign.</p>
<p><strong>Ideally, we would like to raise $80,000</strong>, because then we will have funds for the other needs of the educational complex, such as solar energy and a water supply.</p>
<p>If we raise less than $30,000, then the amount raised will still be used to build as much of the second floor as we have funds for, but construction will stall when the money runs out, until volunteer teams arrive to resume work.</p>

<h3>FAQ: Why Should I Trust FFP?</h3>
<p>If you don't already have some healthy skepticism towards NGOs working in Haiti, then you ought to develop some!  We encourage you to ask penetrating questions of any NGO that you donate towards, including our own.</p>
<p>When you choose a non-governmental organization (NGO) to support, it is vital to pick one that (1) is committed to long-term development and not just short-term aid; (2) has strong accountability structures in place; (3) has enthusiastic local community support; and (4) uses funds effectively by hiring Haitians and stimulating the economy, rather than just paying foreigners to work in Haiti. <strong>FFP strongly emphasizes all four areas.</strong></p>
<p>Here are some more reasons to trust FFP.</p>
<ul>
<li>Every year, FFP hosts scores of volunteers, who visit Haiti personally and not only witness firsthand what FFP is doing, but also work side-by-side with Haitians on the construction site.  Accountability happens not just through paperwork but through firsthand participation.<img alt=""Konekte volunteers working on-site"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://math.mit.edu/~tchow/haiti2/konekte.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Konekte volunteers working on-site""/>
</li>
<li>FFP makes a concerted effort to hire and train Haitians whenever possible, so that salary money goes directly into the pockets of Haitians rather than of Americans working in Haiti.  While volunteers from the U.S. provide accountability and financial support, skilled Haitian laborers can accomplish the actual construction much more quickly and economically.</li>
<li>FFP has already been conducting language classes this past year, borrowing classroom space from another school. On October 13, 2012, we held an inauguration ceremony to celebrate the completion of the first-floor classrooms. Hundreds of members of the community showed up to demonstrate their support! So the school is already off to a running start.  Several organizations, such as <a href=""http://konekteprincetonhaiti.weebly.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Konekte</a>, have already expressed interest in teaching future classes.</li>
<li>FFP has a track record of successful projects.

<h3>FAQ: What are the plans for the long-term sustainability of the school?</h3>
<p>If you have read this far,  you are probably seriously interested in development in Haiti and are aware that constructing a school building is relatively easy compared to the challenge of keeping the school running in the long term.  A building is a one-time cost but teacher salaries, school supplies, utilities, etc., are ongoing needs.  These pose significant challenges, but FFP is optimistic about long-term sustainability for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The language classes have been operating for two years already and have been <strong>sustainable with student fees alone, except for two volunteer teachers from the U.S.</strong> who have taught without pay.  So far there has been no shortage of U.S. teachers willing to teach, and partner organizations such as Konekte are committed to providing volunteers and raising funds for teacher salaries.</li>
<li>Since the opening of the first-floor classrooms, <strong>enrollment in the school has exceeded expectations</strong>.  The school is therefore getting more income than expected from student fees, allowing the school to expand and hire more teachers.</li>
<li>Once the second floor is complete, the school plans to offer <strong>classes in Haitian Creole targeted at American NGO workers</strong> in Haiti.  These classes are expected to turn a profit and to boster the financial stability of the school.</li>

Verplichtingen, verwachtingen en keuzes.
Kiezen vanuit je hart en doen waar je gelukkig van wordt. Mooi gezegd, maar nu de praktijk...
Zachtheid; hoe streng zijn we voor onszelf? Op welke manieren kun je zachter zijn voor jezelf?
De toeschouwer; ben je de toneelspeler of het publiek? Wat betekenen die verschillende rollen?
Uit je eigen wereld stappen. Met frisse energie krijg je een andere kijk op de zaken...
Transformatie van negatief naar positief. Niet alleen qua denken, maar ook qua voelen en ervaren.
Meningen en oordelen; wat doet dat met ons?
Liefde & vergeving; verlicht je hart.
Een gevoel van geluk; hoe creëer je dat intense geluksgevoel.
Zorgeloosheid; hoe komt het dat we ons zo vaak zorgen maken en hoe kunnen we ze loslaten?
Leven en geleefd worden. Hoe kun je ervoor zorgen dat je niet geleefd wordt maar dat je kunt zeggen ‘ik leef!’?

Deze periode heeft me geleerd om mezelf een spiegel voor te houden en me te ontwikkelen, tot een lichter mens ;).De lessen die ik in deze periode leerde, vertaalde ik naar moderne gezegden en zo ontstond het boek 'Eigentijdse Wijsheden'. Ik wil graag mensen inspireren tot een luchtiger leven en zo ontstond dan ook het idee om online cursusprogramma's te ontwikkelen. Ik ben gestart met Inspired by Life en wil met dit project de eerste cursus realiseren.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

is an international spiritual movement dedicated to promoting the understanding

<p></p>
<p><b>The
volunteer spirit…</b></p>
<p>We’re volunteers with HT as we see the dialogue on
Oneness as an important opportunity for us as one human family, which values
human life, to acknowledge that our governments and political frameworks do not
have all the answers. We encourage religious communities to probe deeper
into how Oneness utilizes faith positively and to encourage each person to be
kinder, gentler, more giving and generous to their neighbours.<span>  We are a community of global volunteers
because we passionately believe in encouraging a sense of responsibility so
deep and profound that it shifts and lifts all pockets of humanity to a better
place of being together and that Oneness is the one missing piece in a complex
jigsaw that will provide sustainable peace.</span></p>
<p><b>Global
Oneness Day – growing multifold and making a difference</b></p>
<p>In 2010 HT held an audience with the United Nations
to endorse formal recognition of a “Global Oneness Day” (G1D) to which they
were invited to lead and build the infrastructure, framework and support. G1D
emulates partnership between individuals, politicians and organisations to work
at scale increasing knowledge and awareness of what it means to live in
Oneness. The first event saw 1,000 people participate in recognizing humanity’s
most innate natural relationship and 2012 only its 3<sup>rd</sup> year
witnessed an exponential growth to over 25,000.<span>  In 2013 registrations increased to over 40,000 and total
participation in Global Oneness Day jumped to over 100,000 since the inaugural
year in 2010. </span></p>
<p><b>What We
Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>For the last decade the success of Humanitys Team
(HT) has been built by its members, all of whom are dedicated volunteers who participate in building a better world for current and future
generations.  HT volunteers work unpaid daily to stay engaged and
committed to thousands of people worldwide (our monthly estimate of volunteer
contributions is equivalent to the monetary amount of $1,000,000) and we run
more than fifty global projects worldwide.  Interest in our global good
works on the ground to those in need of service and our focus on Oneness, has
grown to attract over 100,000 with supporters in over 150 countries.</p>
<p>As HT grows to a more prominent place of activity
and influence we are seriously in need of funding for efficient technical
infrastructure, professional marketing campaigns, and the quintessential basic
yet incredibly necessary resources to keep going from strength to strength.
Your funding directly:</p>
<p></p>1) Helps us sustain fast growing functions of Humanity’s Team such as educational outreach, creating personal tools for development, coordination between country and global level programs and building knowledge within communities.<br/><br/>2) Supports volunteers to continue local outreach activities and run on the ground Oneness projects. Regular projects include HT sponsored food drives, disaster recovery to support leaders who have lost everything, humanitarian projects including distributing blankets and funds to the poor, environmental projects, global meditations and more.<br/><br/>3) Build the fifth Global Oneness Day on Friday 24th October 2014 and helps us spread the word about what we are doing and how it makes a difference.  We’ve cumulatively reached 100,000 people since the launch of Global Oneness Day in 2010.  Help us stretch to 100,000 new registrants in 2014.<br/><br/>4) Supports the evolution of a Oneness Digital Campaign to help us expand and deliver messages of Oneness to religious and faith institutions, local politicians, organizations, communities and individuals.<br/> <br/><p><b>Other Ways
You Can Help</b></p>

If you were born in Malaysia, USA, Ecuador, Kuwait, South Korea, Equatorial Guinea or even Norway, you had no control over it. So neither does anybody else in the world.<br/><br/><h2>Why should somebody be judged by his/her nationality? </h2>
<p>This was our question too. We saw many cases of discrimination based on nationality and ""education discrimination"" is one of their worst. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>How did it all happen? </h3>Since mid. 2013 and <a href=""https://www.opendemocracy.net/can-europe-make-it/pooyan-tamimi-arab/norway%27s-shame-educational-discrimination-against-iranian-stud"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">especially after the new conservative minority government formed by the Conservative Party and the Progress Party and took the office</a><span>, the Norwegian authorities </span>set
practices to restrict Iranian students and skilled workers based on domestic
export control laws and international sanctions against Iran. <p></p>
<p>The universities were instructed to be very
conservative about admitting Iranian students and the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration (UDI) was instructed by the authorities to refuse the visa
issuance and renewal applications of many Iranian students based on the same
reason, even for those who are already in Norway and <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28488024"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">have studied and worked for few months/years</a>. A letter from the Ministry of Education and

students. </p>

<p></p>
<h3>Why do they do this to us? </h3>
<p>By these decisions the Norwegian authorities
and especially the Police Security Service (PST) claim to abide by UN
resolutions and domestic export control law. According to these laws, they are expected to
be cautions with respect to the provision of sensitive information proliferation
especially regarding the WMD risk to Iran.</p>
<p>-Are the sanctions something new?</p>
<p>+No. They are more than 6 years old.</p>
<p>-Is Norway the only member of the United Nations?</p>
<p>+No.</p>
<p>-Is there anything in those laws concerning Iranian ordinary students abroad?</p>
<p>+No.</p>-Are the expelled students proven to be linked to any Iranian projects?
<p>+No.</p>
<p>-Have they committed anything wrong? Have been tried or persecuted ever?<br/></p>
<p>+No.</p>
<p>-Are Iranian students and graduates in Norway very keen to go back to Iran?</p>
<p>-No. A <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/notes/stop-educational-discrimination-against-iranians/what-do-iranians-do-after-graduation-in-norway/595407113899672"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">statistical study shows</a> that more than 90% get a relevant job and stay in Norway.<br/></p>
<p>-Are the restrictions only for specific majors like military/nuclear related fields?</p>
<p>+Not really. <a href=""http://www.universitetsavisa.no/student/article20532.ece"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">According to Norwegian media</a> it is a long list of majors that Norwegian
Security Police Service expressed concerns about: <br/></p>

<p>+Yes.</p>
<p>-BTW, is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryam_Mirzakhani"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Maryam Mirzakhani</a> an Iranian mathematician working in the United States?</p>
<p>+Yes. And it is good she did not come to Norway since she might not be the first woman ever to win the prestigious Fields Medal otherwise.</p>
<h3>Did it really happen?</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, yes. We could not believe it in the beginning. It was so shocking that in 21st 
century, a student/skilled worker could be deprived from studying and in some cases 
expelled from a country for the sole reason of his/her nationality. But 
it really happened in Norway.

<br/><h3>What is the situation now?<br/>

<p>Some of the students and skilled workers whose resident permit application were denied by UDI and PST due to the fear of sensitive knowledge transfer, were finally successful in their appeals, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/SEDAI.Event/photos/a.588859431221107.1073741828.588825681224482/639813336125716/?type=1&amp;relevant_count=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">but this was not the case for all</a> like PhD student Hamideh Kaffash who was working on reduction of CO2 emission.</p>

<h3>What should we do now?</h3>
<p>We are left with no option but to keep organizing ""popular protests to make the public aware of what is going on"" and to take necessary legal actions.

<div>This is almost 125000 NOK and is an underestimated amount based on a rough clue from some skilled lawyers in Norway. The cost for the judicial follow-up for different cases that might be funded by us together with all administration fees and the cost for organizing popular protests will exceed this. But we would like to start with funding the cases that can benefit all and potentially change the unfair regulations anyways and here is the starting point. The way it works is that SEDAI gathers all the donation and the affected people will apply for the fund directly. The more beneficial for everybody their cases are, the more chance to get funded. If there is no individual case to be supported, the unfair regulations themselves will be targeted with help of lawyers. </div>
<div>According to lawyers, we may need to bring up the cases to the Norwegian Supreme Court or even European court at some points and the estimation will be a little different, but for the time being the breakdown of the costs could be as following:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>1- First of all, Indiegogo (or any other similar services) <a href=""http://go.indiegogo.com/pricing-fees"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">will charge us</a> for using the service by 4% of the total sum If we reach the goal, and if not 9% of the accumulated money will be taken.<b><i> So it is very important and much cheaper to reach to the target which is 20000 USD now.</i></b>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>2- Then it is the fee for credit cards handlers, between 3-5% depending on the currency and place and also wire fee as a fixed cost. There is also fee applicable for exchange rate to other currencies than USD.<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>3- The fee for bringing up a case to a Norwegian court is estimated to be at least 25000 NOK per day of court. If there are more than one day, it will be multiplied by the number of days required per case and there is also a chance to merge some days in case of similarities between the files. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>4- The wage for the lawyer itself is another story. It can be easily up to 100000 NOK per case.</div>

<div>5- The cost for witnesses to show up in the court and all the travel expenses associated with the cases should be added separately.</div>

If you were born in Malaysia, USA, Ecuador, Kuwait, South Korea, Equatorial Guinea or even Norway, you had no control over it. So neither does anybody else in the world.Why should somebody be judged by his/her nationality? 
This was our question too. We saw many cases of discrimination based on nationality and ""education discrimination"" is one of their worst. 

How did it all happen? Since mid. 2013 and especially after the new conservative minority government formed by the Conservative Party and the Progress Party and took the office, the Norwegian authorities set
practices to restrict Iranian students and skilled workers based on domestic
export control laws and international sanctions against Iran. 
The universities were instructed to be very
conservative about admitting Iranian students and the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration (UDI) was instructed by the authorities to refuse the visa
issuance and renewal applications of many Iranian students based on the same
reason, even for those who are already in Norway and have studied and worked for few months/years. A letter from the Ministry of Education and
Research (here)
shows that the academic institutions are explicitly warned about Iranian
students. 



carton by Morteza Khosravi




Why do they do this to us? 
By these decisions the Norwegian authorities
and especially the Police Security Service (PST) claim to abide by UN
resolutions and domestic export control law. According to these laws, they are expected to
be cautions with respect to the provision of sensitive information proliferation
especially regarding the WMD risk to Iran.
-Are the sanctions something new?
+No. They are more than 6 years old.
-Is Norway the only member of the United Nations?
+No.
-Is there anything in those laws concerning Iranian ordinary students abroad?
+No.-Are the expelled students proven to be linked to any Iranian projects?
+No.
-Have they committed anything wrong? Have been tried or persecuted ever?
+No.
-Are Iranian students and graduates in Norway very keen to go back to Iran?
-No. A statistical study shows that more than 90% get a relevant job and stay in Norway.
-Are the restrictions only for specific majors like military/nuclear related fields?
+Not really. According to Norwegian media it is a long list of majors that Norwegian
Security Police Service expressed concerns about: 



Electronics 
Information Technology 
Chemistry 
Biology 
Physics 
Mathematics 
Space technology 
Construction 
Materials Science 
Metallurgy 
Mechatronics 
Veterinary Studies 
Oil and Gas


-Even mathematics is ""forbidden"" for Iranians?
+Yes.
-BTW, is Maryam Mirzakhani an Iranian mathematician working in the United States?
+Yes. And it is good she did not come to Norway since she might not be the first woman ever to win the prestigious Fields Medal otherwise.
Did it really happen?
Unfortunately, yes. We could not believe it in the beginning. It was so shocking that in 21st 
century, a student/skilled worker could be deprived from studying and in some cases 
expelled from a country for the sole reason of his/her nationality. But 
it really happened in Norway. Mahdi Ghane was expelled from Norway. His supervisor who was obviously happy with him and other Iranian researchers, was totally surprised. Mahdi got another research position in Australia. Siavash Chaeikar was also rejected by UDI for his resident permit application in Norway and then got a research position in Sweden.
What did we do to rectify the situation in Norway?
What we did was to start this campaign called SEDAI which stands for Stop Education Discrimination Against Iranians.The campaign started in May 2014 and ever since:

Many academicians have protested the decision. 
The story has been covered in Norwegian, Swedish, Belgian, British, Iranian, American, Finnish, Spanish, Chinese




and Danish media many times.

NTNU, the most prestigious technical university in Norway has supported the rejected students and appealed the UDI decisions.

Many academicians and academic institutions have supported the campaign.

On 12th June, 2014 a nation-wide protest was successfully organized by SEDAI all over Norway and in main academic cities; Trondheim, Oslo, Bergen, Stavanger and Narvik and also in the capital city of Finland, Helsinki.



On August 20th, 2014 the petition signed by around 13000 people in Norway and around the world was submitted to the Norwegian government and parliament.

  

What is the situation now?

Some of the students and skilled workers whose resident permit application were denied by UDI and PST due to the fear of sensitive knowledge transfer, were finally successful in their appeals, but this was not the case for all like PhD student Hamideh Kaffash who was working on reduction of CO2 emission.
Also there is no good news for those Iranian-born who are living in Norway and were deprived from the right of education explicitly due to their nationality like Mahtab Emamy. In brief, there were some good signs after the campaign but the unfair regulations targeting Iranian-born students have not been changed.  
What should we do now?
We are left with no option but to keep organizing ""popular protests to make the public aware of what is going on"" and to take necessary legal actions. So far everything in this campaign has been performed on cooperation spirit and volunteer-basis. But not everybody is volunteer, especially lawyers.

Who are supporting us?
Professor Noam Chomsky:
And many other prestigious academic and public figures and also academic institutions:



What do we want from you?
We would like to ask for your generous donation to:


organize popular protests


take necessary legal actions





Why 20000 USD?
This is almost 125000 NOK and is an underestimated amount based on a rough clue from some skilled lawyers in Norway.

4- The wage for the lawyer itself is another story. It can be easily up to 100000 NOK per case.

5- The cost for witnesses to show up in the court and all the travel expenses associated with the cases should be added separately.


What if we do not need to go to the court
for individual cases?

If
such good news come true that all the current cases (Kaffash, Emamy, etc)
receive a proper answer and a  fair
treatment, we still need to make sure that the unjustified regulations are
changed and this will be funded from the donations.
Now imagine that the regulations are also changed without spending all the money accumulated. Having the consent of donors; we will donate to similar anti-discrimination activities in Norway or around the world. If a donor was not happy with that, he/she will be refunded after the applicable deduction due to transaction and administration fee.

<p>Our 8th grade consists of nine students. Yes, nine. We have a very small class and unfortunately this greatly affects the cost of each student for our trip. Going door to door is not an option for these students due to the unsafe nature of the area. Our school has a 93% poverty rate which makes it difficult to raise funds. Parents have informed Mrs. Horrigan and myself that they will be unable to help pay for this field trip. This would be a very unfortunate event if a student had to be left behind due to lack of funds.</p>
<p>We chose Washington DC because of the historical importance to our country. Some of our 8th graders have never ventured outside of the state of Ohio. We would like to change this with an educational trip that will be remembered forever.</p>
<p>Please help us with a successful Washington DC field trip.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>For our trip, we are in need of roughly $13,000 total. We are asking for $10,000 and will find other means for the rest. The money will be divided evenly between the students. This trip will be all inclusive for everyone. We decided to go with a company that designs and coordinates an entire trip including: transportation, lodging, food, and tours.</p>
<p>If our goal is not met, we will be using the money for a closer field trip to the local government buildings. Any remaining funds will be used for the next year's 8th grade Washington DC trip.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Mr. Peter was born in South Sudan, and grew up in Bor Village, South Sudan until he was 12 years old. He was orphaned at an early age, his mother dying without warning and his beloved father having passed away when he was five. He lived with his two sisters and his aunts. Things were good for a while but he still missed the care that only his parents could offer him had they lived. His sisters got married, leaving him to remain under the care of relatives and his life became a nightmare. His life at that time was no different than the life of a homeless person. Having both parents gone, his basic childhood needs went unmet and he was neglected. To turn his life around, he sat down one morning on the street curb thinking about where his life was going while watching the kids who have parents going to the local school Konberk, just 10 minutes away from his uncle home. <br/> </p>
<p>Mr. Peter became an orphan fully at age five, and since then he have been struggling for a better life for himself. At that time, he had a dream that he would one day bring changes to his people who are desperately in need of help. Having experienced the tough life of being an orphan has encouraged him to form New Sudan Jonglei Orphans Foundation to raise money and help the orphaned children of Jonglei. “Twenty years ago this was about me but what I say or do today with NSJOF is not about me it is about the orphans who are going through what I went through.” Said Peter. Peter is using the book to raise the awarness about the suffering of orphans in South Sudan. </p>

<p>I started Minds Matter Last Summer after teaching in the public system for five years.  In those years, I encountered so many families that needed educational support and didn't know where to turn.  I met so many wonderful, talented, caring passionate teachers, not getting the support they need to help their students be successful.  I also noticed that too many teachers were getting sick from all of the stress they were experiencing as classroom teachers.  Physically ill... I noticed that parents weren't being included in their children's educational lives and many were clueless to what their children were learning.  I saw smart children who were frustrated and hurting because they weren't receiving the educational support that they needed to be successful. I decided that if change is going to happen and things are going to improve, action needs to take place, so I put in my resignation, invested my retirement fund in Minds Matter and got to work.</p>
<p>I was able to secure a leaning center and pay the rent through this June, buy the furniture we need, hold learning fair and get the supplies we needed to get started.  This was a huge and exciting step!  We now have 5 families that we are helping empower and it's time to start helping other families.  With your help, this dream can become a reality; and together, we will be the catalysts of change for a BETTER EDUCATIONAL FUTURE.</p>
<p>The mission of Minds Matter Educational Services is to ""<strong>Empower Learners, Parents and Teachers so their Gifts Can Shine</strong>.""  This is achieved through educational coaching and workshops for parents, tutoring and enrichment classes for learners and online instructional videos to reach learners and parents all over the world.  Our philosophy is that <strong>every learner is an individual and education should be an experience unique and tailored to the interests and needs of each person</strong>.  We create a safe, positive environment for teachers as well as learners, so they can do what they do best and focus on helping students and parents achieve success on their educational journeys. Our teacher are certified, qualified and passionate about learning and teaching.   We are on a mission to prove that MINDS DO MATTER and learning, whatever path is chosen (public, private or home school) can be a fun, positive experience!</p>
<p>Half of every dollar that surpasses our goal goes into a scholarship fund to provide educational services to low income families.  100% of that money will immediately go toward providing educational support for a family.  It provides: tuition for the learner, educational workshops and training for the parents and a backpack filled with the supplies they need to continue learning at home.  As part of the program, the learner will write you letters periodically to let you know how they are doing.  You will be helping them improve their reading and writing skills as well as providing them with the educational support they need to be successful!</p>
<p>We will take the scholarships to schools in the area and let them distribute them to the families that they think could benefit most from educational support.  </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to reach $5000 dollars.  As we reach this goal, we will be able to buy supplies for our students and learning center, work on our video project, secure our location for the next year and create some materials to get the word out about our mission and how we can help families experience a successful and joyful educational journey.  When we surpass our goal, we will provide scholarships for families in need, continue to grow so we can help as many families as possible and start on the next phase of our project: Minds Matter Special Minds, a center where we provide the Horseboy Method horse assisted learning, an aquatic center and facilities for movement based learning, a nutrition center, a resource center for families and much more to cater to learners with special needs. This will help so many families and teachers! This, we are VERY excited about!</p>
<p>As a contributor, you will become a V.I.P. member of the Minds Matter family and receive educational rewards from us for supporting our mission.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Change has a ripple effect.  For every parent and learner that takes charge of their learning journey and has a wonderful experience with education, a wave of change has begun.  As time goes on, the positive change spreads and more and more people are empowered. The impact of this mission is going to be huge; people all over the world will take charge of learning and inspire others to do the same! </p>

<p><em><strong> </strong></em></p>
<h3>The Details</h3>
<p>My name is Keith and I have been a teacher in Toronto for over 15 years. I have travelled to Ghana, West Africa four times in the past and I've realized that there is something very simple that I can do to help a lot of school children there. I can send them books that Toronto schools no longer use and just throw out! Most schools in Ghana have a very small supply of books, if any at all. Kids spend HOURS a day, copying info that is dictated by the teacher or written on the board, into their ""copy books"" because there are no textbooks. In the past few months I have collected about 700 books from Toronto schools; the books had been stored away in cupboards for years! All I need is a small amount of money to ship the books and get them to the school that I'm in touch with. This will have an immediate impact on what the kids can learn, how quickly they can learn it, and will also allow some kids to work at home.</p>
<h3>How I Will Use the Money</h3>
<p>I have enough books to fill three shipping containers (barrels) right now. I can ship each container (by sea) to Ghana for about $175. The shipper I have used in the past is very reliable. The shipping takes about six weeks and when the books arrive in Ghana, I can have them delivered from the coast to my school (Bright Future School) for about $125 per container. The school is located in Keta, in the Volta Region, which is a few hours drive from the warehouse in Accra, where the books will be sent after arriving. (See gallery pic of students w. yellow uniforms to see the school I'm sending to).</p>
<h3>My Connection to Ghana</h3>
<p>My wife is from Ghana and her father is a retired school teacher in Ghana. She has told me stories about how much time school children spend copying notes off of the board or notes dictated from the teacher. This even happens at some post-secondary institutions, if you can believe it. We are all aware of the difficult circumstances that many African children have to overcome and this is a simple, relatively inexpensive way to really help them to help themselves.</p>

<h3>Foreward from Karen:</h3>
<p><strong>HELLO!</strong>! Thank you for visiting my campaign! My name is Karen Wright and I started this fundraiser for my sister Jennifer. She is an amazing person who has worked so hard to get where she is today. I <em>know</em> she deserves to go <strong>back to school</strong>! I am excited to see how far this next opportunity will take her, as she has already helped as a <strong>role model</strong> to those who have struggled with <strong>chronic pain</strong>. I hope you, too, will find her story to be inspirational.  </p>
<h3>ABOUT ME  </h3>
<p>Hi. I am Jennifer Jones, an average American woman from NJ and on a mission.  *<strong>I appreciate you're taking time to read</strong>*</p>
<p><strong>Back story:</strong></p>
<p>Due to a bad car accident in 1997, damage led to the diagnosis of <em>several chronic pain disorders</em>. During the first 10 year period, <strong>I was prescribed 53</strong> different pharmaceuticals equaling <strong>over 70,000 pills</strong>. After the wheelchair and walker, I utilized lofstran crutches to hold me up while I dragged my legs from behind.  <em>I gained 150 pounds</em> (and developed arthritis in my spine) from spending the majority of time bedridden. At times, a full on chore was getting myself to the bathroom, even with assistance. Many days had the single goal of getting a shower. <em>I was merely surviving</em>. I had had <strong>enough</strong>. I wanted to <em><strong>live</strong></em>.</p>
<p><strong>The Transformation:</strong></p>
<p>In 2007, I sought out<strong> alternative medicine</strong> and through the discipline of many practices: <strong>yoga, meditation, changing diet and adjusting routines</strong>,  my body was supported in removing the narcotics and majority of medications. <strong>I have finally weaned myself off the last pharmaceutical (for nerve pain) this January</strong>! Seeing as I had been through 10 hard detox's- (sweats, chills, profound depression, vomiting, nausea &amp; horrific body pain) I do not ever want to go through that again. So, personal studies have taken on an exploration of more natural, similarly effective, less side effect options. I have lost 157 pounds, triglycerides dropped from 1400's to 70s &amp; I can touch my toes again!  The effects of these holistic practices have been witnessed personally, through observation of my physicians, family and friends and scientifically through various tests. There is no doubt that this transformation was... <strong><em>dramatic</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>My Goal and Funding:</strong></p>
<p><strong>My goal</strong> is to get to <strong>school in mid September for Holistic Nutrition and Western Herbalism.</strong> Yes, I am asking for help. The ambition, motivation and determination are all in place, funding however is not. <strong>Starting all over</strong> and saving for awhile now, still short. Donations will offset school expenses: classes and materials, housing and transportation. I hope that you will find a reason to choose my campaign as <em><strong>your gift will not be wasted</strong></em>.

</div></div>","Foreward from Karen:
HELLO!! Thank you for visiting my campaign! My name is Karen Wright and I started this fundraiser for my sister Jennifer. She is an amazing person who has worked so hard to get where she is today. I know she deserves to go back to school! I am excited to see how far this next opportunity will take her, as she has already helped as a role model to those who have struggled with chronic pain. I hope you, too, will find her story to be inspirational.  
ABOUT ME  
Hi. I am Jennifer Jones, an average American woman from NJ and on a mission.  *I appreciate you're taking time to read*
Back story:
Due to a bad car accident in 1997, damage led to the diagnosis of several chronic pain disorders. During the first 10 year period, I was prescribed 53 different pharmaceuticals equaling over 70,000 pills. After the wheelchair and walker, I utilized lofstran crutches to hold me up while I dragged my legs from behind.  I gained 150 pounds (and developed arthritis in my spine) from spending the majority of time bedridden. At times, a full on chore was getting myself to the bathroom, even with assistance. Many days had the single goal of getting a shower. I was merely surviving. I had had enough. I wanted to live.
The Transformation:
In 2007, I sought out alternative medicine and through the discipline of many practices: yoga, meditation, changing diet and adjusting routines,  my body was supported in removing the narcotics and majority of medications. I have finally weaned myself off the last pharmaceutical (for nerve pain) this January! Seeing as I had been through 10 hard detox's- (sweats, chills, profound depression, vomiting, nausea & horrific body pain) I do not ever want to go through that again. So, personal studies have taken on an exploration of more natural, similarly effective, less side effect options. I have lost 157 pounds, triglycerides dropped from 1400's to 70s & I can touch my toes again!  The effects of these holistic practices have been witnessed personally, through observation of my physicians, family and friends and scientifically through various tests. There is no doubt that this transformation was... dramatic.
My Goal and Funding:
My goal is to get to school in mid September for Holistic Nutrition and Western Herbalism. Yes, I am asking for help. The ambition, motivation and determination are all in place, funding however is not. Starting all over and saving for awhile now, still short. Donations will offset school expenses: classes and materials, housing and transportation. I hope that you will find a reason to choose my campaign as your gift will not be wasted. I have much to do in this lifetime and many lives I wish to have a positive impact on. Wisdoms learned, need to be shared.
Come, be a part of the Story!
Gifts:
Contributors receiving a bead from the bead chain exhibit will get a handcrafted gift card, each numbered and signed. Replacement beads will carry contributors name (or initials) and corresponding card number.  {*beads were recycled, repurposed and donated to this display*} 
~**How incredibly fragile the human body, how incredibly resilient.**~

Thank you Green Day- this song resonates with me deeply.

In the 1970s I conducted pioneering research on the intelligence and language abilities of captive and excaptive orangutans in California and in Borneo. In the 1980s I co-founded a nonprofit that helped rehabilitate excaptive orangutans in Borneo. <strong>Now I want to stop the killing of wild orangutans and insure their survival for future generations.</strong> EDUCATION (not rehabilitation) is the key.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Program:</strong> The Orang Utan Republik Foundation (OURF), a 501c3 nonprofit organization I co-founded in 2007, has been collaborating with the Orangutan Information Center in Sumatra and the Palung Foundation in Borneo to fund an important scholarship program in the name of the great red ape: the <em><strong>Orangutan Caring Scholarship.</strong></em> Students that receive the scholarship go to school, conduct research on orangutans, and volunteer for the Indonesian partner organizations. When the students graduate, they become advocates and supporters for orangutan survival. Some become field biologists, veterinarians, forestry officers, teachers, and professionals in the private and public sector.  </p>

<p><strong>How it works:</strong> OURF finds the funds and the Indonesian organizations administers the program.

Each scholarship costs about $1500 and provides tuition funding over a 4-year period, the normal time it takes for an undergraduate student to obtain a degree in the fields of biology and forestry. Veterinarian students take an extra year.</p>
<p>Since beginning the program in 2006, OURF has funded <a href=""http://www.orangutanrepublik.org/programs/education-initiatives/orangutan-caring-scholarship-program/recipients-of-the-orangutan-caring-scholarships"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Scholarship Recipients""><strong>47</strong> scholarships</a>. Many of students have already graduated and are working in government and nongovernment sectors. Some have gone on to graduate school. We want to keep the funds coming so we can graduate more and more appreciative and knowledgeable citizens in the country there most orangutans are found.</p>
<p>Scholarship funds have usually come from orangutan and other nonprofit organizations but with collaboration from people like you, we can prepare for the 2013 Scholarship program and we can keep the program sustained. </p>
<p><strong>How you can help:</strong> I want to see if our campaign can raise enough funds to support six scholarships in 2013: $9,000. By keeping funding participation affordable, we can raise those funds.... possibly even more.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Will Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise $9,000 to fund 6 scholarships in 2013. Frankly we want to fund more scholarships and will be seeking additional funds for our scholarship fund through other venues. But to get the $9,000, we have developed a menu of seven levels of participation:</p>
<h3>                  <strong>$10, $20, $50, $100, $500, $1,500, &amp; $5,000</strong>
</h3>
<p>With those choices, anyone can participate and contribute to this important program.  In most cases, these contributions are fully tax-deductible.</p>
<p>Here is what you or some you choose will get for your participation:</p>
<ul>
<li>you will be thanked on our website for $10</li>
<li>a certificate of support plus a thank you for $20</li>
<li>a photo of the last class of recipients plus the above for $50</li>
<li>special annual membership plus all of the above for $100</li>
<li>an orangutan sculpture plus all the above for $500</li>
<li>Special recognition at our next fundraiser for $1,500</li>
<li>Special VIP recognition at our next fundraiser for $5,000</li>
</ul>
<p>We made it so that it will take a mix of caring people to help us reach our goal. Will you be among those caring people?  We plan to deliver the certificates and photos by email as pdfs but we can also specially send them (at an additional cost) to people as a gift. Our goal is to raise as much as we can for the scholarships- not overhead for this program.  If we do not reach our $9,000 goal, we will apply whatever funds we receive towards the Orangutan Caring Scholarship fund.</p>

<h3>The Impact: Orangutans and People Benefit</h3>
<p>The Orangutan Caring Scholarship has grown over the last 7 years. It is bringing educational opportunities to students who wouldn't otherwise be able to go to college. It is branding the name: <strong>orangutan</strong> with something beneficial to local people. Here are some of the other benefits of the Orangutan Caring Scholarship program:</p>
<ul>
<li>Young women are receiving higher education opportunities and choosing academics over large families.</li>
<li>The local press covering the award ceremonies also educate the public about orangutans and their plight.</li>
<li>Good will is generated in predominately Muslim communities during a time where more Western good will is needed.</li>
<li>Orangutans are gaining knowledgeable Indonesian advocates that will speak out on their behalf.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is what some of the past recipients have said about receiving the Orangutan Caring Scholarship (OCS):</p>
<p><em>""the OCS has allowed me to actively get involved in field works conducted by the OIC to save the orangutans and ther habitat. After I graduated from my study, I first worked as a forestry consultant for a company in Aceh but now I am working as a financial analyist for a national bank in Medan where I can teach my conservation knowledge to many companies who are dealing with my services.""</em>     -<strong>Syarifah Lia Andriati</strong>, the first recipient of the Orangutan Caring Scholarship.</p>
<p><em>""It took me about more than six months to complete my research, but I am now relieved and feel satisfied as I have finished my research and my study with distinction. I am now looking for a career opportunity, and I really hope that I can get a job that will allow me to help conserve orangutans and their rainforest home.""</em> <strong>-Fifi Wilyanti</strong>, 2008 recipient</p>
<p><em>""I was awarded the OCS in 2008 and I was very pleased to know that the OCS allowed me to become a volunteer in OIC, a local conservation NGO dedicated to conservation of Sumatran orangutan. By the time I was awarded the OCS, I knew that I would learn  more about the orangutans and how I could help protect this important species. I graduated in 2010.  I hope my research can be widely published so many people will learn more about orangutans. I am now awaiting job interview for the position of a biologist for a conservation NGO based in Medan.""</em> -<strong>Nurzaidah Putri Dalimunthe, </strong>2008 recipient.</p>

</p><p>I’m Keri Robin, and this is…</p>
<p><b>My
Story</b></p>
<p>Breast Cancer has been in my life
since 1984 when my mother was diagnosed at the young age of 43 years old. 
Mom suffered through years of chemotherapy and radiation,  and she endured
years of estrogen suppression pills.  Fifteen years later, after we were
told that she was cured, the cancer came back and took her life.  She did
everything she was told to do, but it still came back.  Why?</p><p>                                         <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/729008/files/20140719095516-Mom_n_Me.png?1405788916"" src="""" style=""width: 234.33px; height: 171px;""/></p><p></p>
<p>Then I became a victim at the age of
48 and was obsessed with determining the cause of my cancer.  You see,
besides my mother, I didn't fit the standard risk factors.  I was not
overweight, I exercised regularly, I took no birth control or hormone pills, my
BRCA (breast cancer)  gene came back negative and I did not drink alcohol
or smoke.</p>
<p>The doctors were only interested in
killing the cancer, not finding out what was wrong with my body that caused the
disease to form.  However, a knowledgeable doctor tested me for
deficiencies.  I had a leaky gut, toxic mercury levels, high lead levels
and vitamin shortages.  My liver was actually trying to make Vitamin
C!  My oxygen level was in the eighties and I was very
acidic. Through my own layman's research, I discovered all of these
elements left my immune system fighting everything else but the
cancer.  These were MY risk factors!</p>
<p><b>The
Impact</b></p>
<p>Surviving Breast Cancer has to be
learned.  You must be committed to make alterations in your
life.  You must be diligent to rid your body of toxins that are blocking
the immune system.  It also means rewiring your brain to accept these
changes in your lifestyle.</p>
<p><b>What
Is Needed </b></p>
<p>I need your support to obtain a
Recreational Therapy degree and become a Certified Health Coach specializing in breast cancer survival.  I
plan to use the educational credentials to:                                                            </p><p></p>
<p>1)  Help Breast Cancer victims
with wellness education and positive image reinforcement activities.</p>
<p>2)  Teach all girls and women
to recognize the toxins associated with this disease and adopt healthy
lifestyle changes.</p>
<p>3)  Conduct touring seminars to
reach beyond my community.</p>
<p><b>Where The Funds Go</b></p>
<p>Funds raised will go towards tuition with a small donation to the Breast Cancer Fund and the Aggies for Christ / Missions.</p>
<p><b>What You Get</b></p>
<p>To start or enhance your Breast
Cancer Prevention Program, I offer a wonderful variety of really awesome perks
as a great big THANK YOU for your contribution!  (I am not able to ship internationally.)                       </p><p>                       <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/811738/files/20140825175055-perks.png?1409014255"" src="""" style=""width: 380px; height: 282px;""/></p><p></p>

My
Story
Breast Cancer has been in my life
since 1984 when my mother was diagnosed at the young age of 43 years old. 
Mom suffered through years of chemotherapy and radiation,  and she endured
years of estrogen suppression pills.  Fifteen years later, after we were
told that she was cured, the cancer came back and took her life.  She did
everything she was told to do, but it still came back.  Why?                                         
Then I became a victim at the age of
48 and was obsessed with determining the cause of my cancer.  You see,
besides my mother, I didn't fit the standard risk factors.  I was not
overweight, I exercised regularly, I took no birth control or hormone pills, my
BRCA (breast cancer)  gene came back negative and I did not drink alcohol
or smoke.
The doctors were only interested in
killing the cancer, not finding out what was wrong with my body that caused the
disease to form.  However, a knowledgeable doctor tested me for
deficiencies.  I had a leaky gut, toxic mercury levels, high lead levels
and vitamin shortages.  My liver was actually trying to make Vitamin
C!  My oxygen level was in the eighties and I was very
acidic. Through my own layman's research, I discovered all of these
elements left my immune system fighting everything else but the
cancer.  These were MY risk factors!
The
Impact
Surviving Breast Cancer has to be
learned.  You must be committed to make alterations in your
life.  You must be diligent to rid your body of toxins that are blocking
the immune system.  It also means rewiring your brain to accept these
changes in your lifestyle.
What
Is Needed 
I need your support to obtain a
Recreational Therapy degree and become a Certified Health Coach specializing in breast cancer survival.  I
plan to use the educational credentials to:                                                            
1)  Help Breast Cancer victims
with wellness education and positive image reinforcement activities.
2)  Teach all girls and women
to recognize the toxins associated with this disease and adopt healthy
lifestyle changes.
3)  Conduct touring seminars to
reach beyond my community.
Where The Funds Go
Funds raised will go towards tuition with a small donation to the Breast Cancer Fund and the Aggies for Christ / Missions.
What You Get
To start or enhance your Breast
Cancer Prevention Program, I offer a wonderful variety of really awesome perks
as a great big THANK YOU for your contribution!  (I am not able to ship internationally.)
