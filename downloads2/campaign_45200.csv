Our ancestors attempted to explain the origins of the world and describe the lives and adventures of a wide variety of gods, goddesses, heroes, heroines and mythological creatures. Greek mythology has had an extensive influence on the culture, arts, and literature of Western civilization and remains part of the Western heritage. This is why we wanted to share with you these myths.How? By printing unique designs inspired by Greek myths and legends on T-shirts!Everyone wears a T-shirt, right?  Then, why don' t you wear something stylish with a unique print that captures a history of thousand years? ""Gorgon and Athena"" unites the past and the present. Aren't you tired of the same standardized T-shirts about Greece?We are! That's why we wanted to offer you something exclusive and modern; thus, we gathered young talented artists from Greece and made a hub of inspiration and creativity! We design our prints under the Greek hot sun, feeling the breeze of the Mediterranean sea and enjoying the beauty of Athens.Every T-shirt is hand-printed, and that makes it unique! We have inspiration, creativity, and know-how. What we do not have is enough capital. Why do we need capital? Let us explain to you how the economies of scale work. If we design and print only one T-shirt, it will be costly and unaffordable for everyone. This happens as the fixed costs will be included in the price of just one T-shirt.But what if we could print dozens of T-shirts? The increased total output would result in reduced costs per T-shirt and thus, at an affordable price. This is the reason that we have to print at once as many as possible T-shirts for each graphic design.Here is where you come in. We need your help to raise the required capital to print our T-shirts. We have already printed one of our designs, but we need more money to print the rest of them.What you have to do is pre-order your favourite designs, and then we will print all the T-shirts and deliver it to you by the end of May. Except for the fact that you are gonna be the first to get the ""Gorgon & Athena"" T-shirts, you will have an up to 30% discount off the retail price.         *Disclaimer - All pictures shown are for illustration purpose only. Actual product may vary. We work with Meraki (μεράκι) and Filotimo (φιλότιμο).These are two Greek words that are hard to translate.
Meraki means that we do everything with soul and love and we put “something of ourselves” into our prints.
Filotimo means “love of honour”, and we do this by respecting our customers and giving priority to business ethics.
In ""Gorgon and Athena"" we keep the social and environmental standards as high as possible by assessing our suppliers and partners frequently for their processes and materials. Moreover, our T-shirts are hand-printed using water-based inks.We want to build a network with customers based on trust and loyalty!  If we reach our funding goal, we will start creating new graphic designs!Here are our stretch goals:
If we manage to raise $5,500, we will unlock the full collection of Artemis!
If we manage to raise $7,000, we will unlock one new graphic design!
If we manage to raise $8,500, we will unlock two new graphic designs!
If we manage to raise $10,000, we will unlock two new graphic designs!
Goddess Athena used to wear a Gorgon head on her shield.In ancient Greece, the Gorgon head was a symbol of protection against evil. Thus the Greeks used to wear it as a protective pendant on their clothes and shields. It was also popular as a royal symbol.In Greek mythology, Gorgons were female creatures who are consistently pictured as monsters of hideous aspect. They had hair made of living snakes and fearsome teeth. The mere sight of Gorgons was sufficient to turn the beholder to stone. Our designing & production team' s goal is to guarantee the highest quality and to minimize all the possible risks. We have created our prototype, and we are waiting to start the printing process.Of course, there are challenges when running a company. We'll need to pay our suppliers, make arrangements for shipping and handling, and make sure that all orders are going to be fulfilled.

We then decided to move our operation to the local factory soon after seeing the superior quality of the boots we were producing here. Two and and a half years later we found ourself in the unique position to acquire this amazing facility and take control of our own operation from the ground up. In order to fulfill this factory element the factory itself needs to be restored to its original glory to in order to maximize its potential as a manufacturer and also pave the way for a next generation of makers. Simply put, we need to put the factory back to work in order to achieve these goals.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">To launch our Kickstarter project we have developed an exclusive boot collection that both highlights and represents the nature of the manufacturing and community that surrounds it. We have developed a unique combination of leathers and American Made components solely for this project. We are offering this collection far below retail cost in the hopes to gain long time customers who appreciate the quality and dynamics of our products and appreciate what we are setting out to build as a brand. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482392349/a4lhlpt3de57xbvnvevt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482393503/sung4mi70e6v02cckv3q.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482393879/ig717m5y2qwlsoysjlgk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482393683/hseqsq9ptmei2shlgrgf.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482393932/rfvlrzyp6bmcjaghuob8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482393758/onwieoaiqke6rvdaaatp.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482393959/e9oma8c5ekdnp8v5uvrj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482393819/g3ryfedzxgzta31kmzey.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482394018/so7dxjythhotgl7bphmm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">We started this collection by working with our best tanneries from around the United States and our local finishing house here in Los Angeles to use the finest leather assortment available.

Boots with steel shanks are more rugged and durable than boots with fiberglass or plastic shanks. The shankpiece reinforces the waist of the shoe and prevents it from collapsing or distorting in wear. The contour of the shank is determined by heel height. Shoes with low heels or wedged soles do not require a shank because the torque between the rear and forefoot does not distort the shoe. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482394115/qkk8jwrddvh28702kc0y.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">All quality boots are built around a carefully crafted foot shaped model - known as a “last”. It is the last which gives a boot its fit characteristics. We spent years perfecting our fits, and are sure you will love the fit as well. The quality of the lasting, and the time that each upper spends on the last, is crucial in giving all BROKEN HOMME boots their unique shape and fit.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482394174/p1f9jlohbitmhfyyfdc4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">The Goodyear Welt is traditionally used because it allows for comfort, durability, and the ability to be resoled. The upper part of the shoe is first formed over the last with a midsole of leather enclosing the bottom. A strip of leather know as the welt is sewn to edge of the upper and midsole. Before sewing the final outsole to complete the shoe, the cavity between the outsole and midsole is filled with cork. This cork layer serves as a cushion and a way for the shoe to “breathe”. Because the midsole is made of leather and filled with cork, the foot bed retains the shape of the wearer’s foot, improving fit and comfort. When the sole is eventually worn out, the welt is undone and the new sole is attached back to the welt without disturbing the imprinted leather and cork midsole.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482394225/x9ykgxi3bp7td4jdhqdw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482394253/odaphy0erpdy7pcnvt2w.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Every one of our boots is finished with some style of Vibram outsole.

We want you to expect nothing but the highest quality product in terms of fit and design.After an initial phase of developing, and manufacturing the our collection in a couple large scale operations throughout the US we happened upon a boutique factory located in Los Angeles are who had been producing safety boots for the Union Longshoreman in the Port of Los Angles. We immediately saw potential in this operation as they had been producing top quality footwear since the early 1970’s. We then decided to move our operation to the local factory soon after seeing the superior quality of the boots we were producing here. Two and and a half years later we found ourself in the unique position to acquire this amazing facility and take control of our own operation from the ground up. In order to fulfill this factory element the factory itself needs to be restored to its original glory to in order to maximize its potential as a manufacturer and also pave the way for a next generation of makers. Simply put, we need to put the factory back to work in order to achieve these goals.To launch our Kickstarter project we have developed an exclusive boot collection that both highlights and represents the nature of the manufacturing and community that surrounds it. We have developed a unique combination of leathers and American Made components solely for this project. We are offering this collection far below retail cost in the hopes to gain long time customers who appreciate the quality and dynamics of our products and appreciate what we are setting out to build as a brand. We started this collection by working with our best tanneries from around the United States and our local finishing house here in Los Angeles to use the finest leather assortment available. We then merchandised this unique collection with 2 of our best styles, our factories staple longshoreman boot, and then developed the harness boot and chelsea boot to be both released for the first time to you.To ensure they are as strong as stylish, each boot is built using goodyear welt construction, metal shanks, and cork filled midsoles. Our boots are comfy out of the box, but will always get better with age.BROKEN HOMME boots are all built using only the most quality leathers from multiple U.S. tanneries as well as a finishing house located here in Los Angeles. Every leather in this collection is between 4-5.5oz in thickness to ensure durability and to maintain the shape of the boot for years to come.The steel shank is a piece of steel that is about 1” wide and about 4” long that is placed in the boot during the bottoming process in manufacturing. Boots with steel shanks are more rugged and durable than boots with fiberglass or plastic shanks. The shankpiece reinforces the waist of the shoe and prevents it from collapsing or distorting in wear. The contour of the shank is determined by heel height. Shoes with low heels or wedged soles do not require a shank because the torque between the rear and forefoot does not distort the shoe. All quality boots are built around a carefully crafted foot shaped model - known as a “last”. It is the last which gives a boot its fit characteristics. We spent years perfecting our fits, and are sure you will love the fit as well. The quality of the lasting, and the time that each upper spends on the last, is crucial in giving all BROKEN HOMME boots their unique shape and fit.The Goodyear Welt is traditionally used because it allows for comfort, durability, and the ability to be resoled. The upper part of the shoe is first formed over the last with a midsole of leather enclosing the bottom. A strip of leather know as the welt is sewn to edge of the upper and midsole. Before sewing the final outsole to complete the shoe, the cavity between the outsole and midsole is filled with cork. This cork layer serves as a cushion and a way for the shoe to “breathe”. Because the midsole is made of leather and filled with cork, the foot bed retains the shape of the wearer’s foot, improving fit and comfort. When the sole is eventually worn out, the welt is undone and the new sole is attached back to the welt without disturbing the imprinted leather and cork midsole. Every one of our boots is finished with some style of Vibram outsole. Vibram is the world leader in high performance rubber soles, targeted to the outdoor, work, recreation, fashion, repair and military markets. For more than 70 years, the famous yellow octagon that identifies their brand has been synonymous with quality, performance, safety, innovation and design. We use all Vibram outsoles manufactured in the United States from their factory in Brookfield, Massachusetts.Our factory is ready to roll now, we are scheduled to start our production run to begin on January 30th, and we aim to start shipping boots to our supporters in April of 2017.After choosing your reward, we will message you directly on Kickstarter within 24 hours of the campaign closing(January 24th) to get your style/color/size selections. Because we are using a lean production process and manufacturing shoes as they are being ordered, it is important to fill out the selection survey as quickly as possible.Five years into this, we have received a decent amount of press, but one really meant a lot to us, in 2015 we were featured in a article by the Wall Street Journal as one of the top five ""Cobblers to Watch Out For"". This was even before we were running our own factory, so we can't wait to see what the future has in store for us from here on out.",33.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div><p>We are two guys who spoke a tremendous amount of game during our time together on board USS George H.W. Bush. We spoke of big dreams and plans to settle down in Florida operating our own business together. We've picked up some good habits, attitudes, and ethics from our naval service, and we couldn't be more thankful for that opportunity. Now we are eager to bring our plans to reality with the help of those who will also benefit from our services.</p><div> </div><p>This campaign is to get us the initial equipment needed to get started. The different services we provide depend on how well this campaign goes, but nothing will stop us from growing and offering new services! To explain what equipment we need, let us first tell you what services we want to provide. </p><p>Originally, we wanted our own clothing line. But it was going to take big bucks to completely brand our clothing, because who wants a shirt going to their customers with the ""Gildan"" tag still on it, right? Not a professional clothing brand in our eyes, and we don't have big bucks on Navy salary. So we put that behind us and instead focused on making it easier for us and others who feel the same way! And yes, there are one or two companies out there who offer the services we plan to offer, but when we set up just a t-shirt with them the way we wanted (screen printed, tag removed and replaced with ours, sewn in label on sleeve), the price is nearly $27! So did we want to have a $30 t-shirt + shipping in our clothing line? Not at all. We understand setup costs, but we're aiming for long term relationships that will pay for those costs later on. That's where we want to come in at $15 less! Maybe it's the labor they're afraid of? We're accustomed to working 13 hours a day, 7 days a week for 8 months out of a year (thanks USS GHW Bush). We're not afraid of some hard work. So help us, help you make a completely branded clothing line or product and ship it to customers for you, with:</p><div> </div><ul> <li>Screen Printing</li> <li>DTG Printing</li> <li>Embroidery</li>
<li>Engraving (To laser etch leather belts, buckles and other products)</li>
<li>3D Printing</li>
<li>Sublimation</li>
<li>Custom Printed Boxes (we wanted this for our brand!)</li>
<li>Custom Tags (this is a must, makes your brand look ""boss"")</li>
<li>And More! </li>
</ul><p>And some services that shouldn't cost you, since it doesn't cost us:</p><ul>
<li>Tag Removal</li>
<li>Photography of Products</li>
<li>Mock-ups of Products</li>
<li>And so on (These really depend on your creativity, but these are some services we've looked for)</li> </ul><div> </div><p>Now a shirt built how we want it for $15 bucks, we can do that. We hope that you can too!</p><div> </div> <div> </div><h3>What We Need, Nothing More</h3><div> </div><p>We shook some hands and spoke to people who have some deals on equipment waiting for us to make our move. And we've broken it down to three levels we planned this campaign can take us to.</p><p><strong>LEVEL ONE</strong></p><div>
</div><div>
<p><em>Raising just 30%</em> of our campaign would take us to <strong>LEVEL ONE</strong> allowing us to get everything we need to offer only Direct-To-Garment printing for those who want to get their brand started. We will still be able to perform the services we don't need equipment for, like tag removal and shipping to your customers for example. From here we would expand after a brief period to offer 8-color screen printing of your garments, posters, or other products until we can move on to larger equipment!<br/>30% of our campaign will get us everything we need for the high quality DTG printing method we're looking for (because we want our prints to look nice!). We're aiming for: </p>
<ol>
<li>The <strong>Brother GT-381</strong> for its 14 in. x 16 in. 1200dpi prints (which will make a portrait print perfect on a garment if you wanted!). This normally has a price tag of $28,000!</li>
<li>The <strong>pre-treatment machine</strong> needed to pre-coat your garments so the design bonds to the fabric and lasts. This would normally run us $4,999!</li>
<li>The <strong>heat press</strong> we'll need will cost us $1,200! This is used to heat the pre-treatment onto the garment, and with a different pressure flash dry the design after printing. This fancy dual pressure heat press will do just that for us.</li>
<li>And <strong>all the supplies</strong>, like pre-treatment and repair tools we'll need to get started!</li>
</ol>
<p>We already have web knowledge so we save on our ""store front"". So we'd be able to get started on DTG printing and drop shipping your COMPLETELY unique brand for just $26,000! Our <strong>LEVEL ONE</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>LEVEL TWO</strong></p>
<p>Reaching 70% of our goal would allow us to offer 12 color screen printing right away along with the DTG printing. This will make it possible for new brand startups to enjoy the quality of a screen printed shirt while not having to pay until they sell it on their website. And at a price we would have agreed to! So, reaching level two in our campaign will get us:</p>
<ol>
<li>An <strong>8 or 10 station screen printing press</strong> that we will use to manually print your garments and products. A quality one of these go from $8,000 to $20,000!</li>
<li>A few <strong>flash dryers </strong>to cure each color layer of ink as we lay them down. These can be relatively cheap, but a lasting one at the size we need will hurt pockets.</li>
<li>A <strong>conveyor dryer</strong> for the final curing and drying of your garments for wearing and washing.</li>
<li>A fancy <strong>Epson printer</strong> for printing designs onto our film for creating the screens. This baby will have a double purpose, since we can also print posters. Depending on how we do, we'll choose between a $1200 or $4000 version.</li>
<li>An <strong>exposure unit</strong> that will prep the screens for printing the designs. We're opting for a quality vacuum unit for the best screen quality.</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">The </span><strong style=""background-color: initial;"">software</strong><span style=""background-color: initial;""> we want to use will go for $1600 since we're planning on using AccuRip with Adobe Illustrator and Separation Studio for proofs.</span>
</li>
<li>And our squeegees and initial paints. We'll probably accrue these over time.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are more things needed in a shop for screen printing of course, but they're things we can build ourselves since they have nothing to do with the quality of the print. And we'd like to save ourselves as much money to pass those savings on.</p>
<p><strong>LEVEL THREE</strong></p>
<p>Reaching 100% of our campaign goal would bring us to level three! With this level of achievement we can squeeze in embroidery to our list of services. So we can go from just screen printing or sewing things onto garments and hats to embroidering on them! For this we'll just need a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>An<strong> embroidery machine</strong>. Which will be chosen based on how well Jesse managed our piggy bank (just kidding both of us are needed for the secret hand shake part of its access). Our first choice would be the better choice, in our opinion and research, The Tajima TFMX-C1501. Which is way steep and would be purchased later. But if we receive enough feedback from our community of new clothing brand/business owners, we'll opt for the more obtainable Brother P1000e for $11,000 to $15,000. At least we'll be able to bring everyone the option of embroidery sooner, with awesome prices.</li>
<li>And all we really need with this is a mess load of threads and some hoops to hold each type of garment. The little things we can handle!</li>
</ol>
<p>Now what if we Super Saiyan Level Four it like our pal Goku (we hope you know who that is)? We're keeping realistic, but that's what we'd really like to see! If we see that too many folks want a less expensive route to getting their brand looking boss, making our campaign goal shoot passed 100%, then we'd have to take action.</p>
<p>We'll of course want to show our appreciation by upgrading everyone's perks and sending everyone gift's throughout the year! That means we'll do a little extra to make you happy about your perk.</p>
<p>Please, let's get into what we can give you for your contribution!</p>

<p><b>12. HAND MADE REPLICA MK 76 LAMP, $200</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Get a taste of our services with a lamp, made custom by us, the
Rugged team, using recycled metals. A life size replica of the typical training weapon
used by us while serving in the Navy. The actual practice weapon is used to
train pilots in the delivery of the live general purpose bomb it’s designed to
simulate. Our jobs as Ordnancemen were to assemble and load these puppies onto
combat aircraft.</p>
<p>Your lamp will be sculpted and shaped using mostly recycled
aluminum cans, sanded and painted, then wired to serve as an accent lamp or
conversation piece. By default, we will paint the bomb body to resemble the
general purpose MK-80 series it was designed for (as shown in the
image). We are leaning toward accepting custom color, base, and shade requests
and will contact you for them near the end of our campaign.</p>
<p>We’re making these lamps during this campaign only! Each
will be stenciled “Made Specially For (recipient)”. At the conclusion of this
campaign these will no longer be available unless someone else decides to
reproduce them! -They can also be converted into a vase or other creative ideas upon request.-</p>

Set it up to work automatically by notifying us when an order is placed on it, then we can print that order and ship it to your customer. We'll customize the look and your store emails. Add a few features, integrate your social networks, setup your free newsletter, etc. And lastly, walk you through setting up your payment gateways so your customers can pay you! Our goal for our service is to make this possible (opening an online shop for just the cost of hosting). You can easily learn to do this yourself through many forums and Google searches, so you can potentially start your shop for the cost of a $5 hosting plan! If you want to contribute to our cause however, we'll take care of the tedious stuff for you, get this perk!</p>

</div></div>","Short, But Not So Short, Depending On How Much You Like To Read, Summary
We are two guys who spoke a tremendous amount of game during our time together on board USS George H.W. Bush. We spoke of big dreams and plans to settle down in Florida operating our own business together. We've picked up some good habits, attitudes, and ethics from our naval service, and we couldn't be more thankful for that opportunity. Now we are eager to bring our plans to reality with the help of those who will also benefit from our services. This campaign is to get us the initial equipment needed to get started. The different services we provide depend on how well this campaign goes, but nothing will stop us from growing and offering new services! To explain what equipment we need, let us first tell you what services we want to provide. Originally, we wanted our own clothing line. But it was going to take big bucks to completely brand our clothing, because who wants a shirt going to their customers with the ""Gildan"" tag still on it, right? Not a professional clothing brand in our eyes, and we don't have big bucks on Navy salary. So we put that behind us and instead focused on making it easier for us and others who feel the same way! And yes, there are one or two companies out there who offer the services we plan to offer, but when we set up just a t-shirt with them the way we wanted (screen printed, tag removed and replaced with ours, sewn in label on sleeve), the price is nearly $27! So did we want to have a $30 t-shirt + shipping in our clothing line? Not at all. We understand setup costs, but we're aiming for long term relationships that will pay for those costs later on. That's where we want to come in at $15 less! Maybe it's the labor they're afraid of? We're accustomed to working 13 hours a day, 7 days a week for 8 months out of a year (thanks USS GHW Bush). We're not afraid of some hard work. So help us, help you make a completely branded clothing line or product and ship it to customers for you, with:  Screen Printing DTG Printing Embroidery
Engraving (To laser etch leather belts, buckles and other products)
3D Printing
Sublimation
Custom Printed Boxes (we wanted this for our brand!)
Custom Tags (this is a must, makes your brand look ""boss"")
And More! 
And some services that shouldn't cost you, since it doesn't cost us:
Tag Removal
Photography of Products
Mock-ups of Products
And so on (These really depend on your creativity, but these are some services we've looked for)  Now a shirt built how we want it for $15 bucks, we can do that. We hope that you can too!   What We Need, Nothing More We shook some hands and spoke to people who have some deals on equipment waiting for us to make our move. And we've broken it down to three levels we planned this campaign can take us to.LEVEL ONE

Raising just 30% of our campaign would take us to LEVEL ONE allowing us to get everything we need to offer only Direct-To-Garment printing for those who want to get their brand started. We will still be able to perform the services we don't need equipment for, like tag removal and shipping to your customers for example. From here we would expand after a brief period to offer 8-color screen printing of your garments, posters, or other products until we can move on to larger equipment!30% of our campaign will get us everything we need for the high quality DTG printing method we're looking for (because we want our prints to look nice!). We're aiming for: 

The Brother GT-381 for its 14 in. x 16 in. 1200dpi prints (which will make a portrait print perfect on a garment if you wanted!). This normally has a price tag of $28,000!
The pre-treatment machine needed to pre-coat your garments so the design bonds to the fabric and lasts. This would normally run us $4,999!
The heat press we'll need will cost us $1,200! This is used to heat the pre-treatment onto the garment, and with a different pressure flash dry the design after printing. This fancy dual pressure heat press will do just that for us.
And all the supplies, like pre-treatment and repair tools we'll need to get started!

We already have web knowledge so we save on our ""store front"". So we'd be able to get started on DTG printing and drop shipping your COMPLETELY unique brand for just $26,000! Our LEVEL ONE.
LEVEL TWO
Reaching 70% of our goal would allow us to offer 12 color screen printing right away along with the DTG printing. This will make it possible for new brand startups to enjoy the quality of a screen printed shirt while not having to pay until they sell it on their website. And at a price we would have agreed to! So, reaching level two in our campaign will get us:

An 8 or 10 station screen printing press that we will use to manually print your garments and products. A quality one of these go from $8,000 to $20,000!
A few flash dryers to cure each color layer of ink as we lay them down. These can be relatively cheap, but a lasting one at the size we need will hurt pockets.
A conveyor dryer for the final curing and drying of your garments for wearing and washing.
A fancy Epson printer for printing designs onto our film for creating the screens. This baby will have a double purpose, since we can also print posters. Depending on how we do, we'll choose between a $1200 or $4000 version.
An exposure unit that will prep the screens for printing the designs. We're opting for a quality vacuum unit for the best screen quality.

The software we want to use will go for $1600 since we're planning on using AccuRip with Adobe Illustrator and Separation Studio for proofs.

And our squeegees and initial paints. We'll probably accrue these over time.

There are more things needed in a shop for screen printing of course, but they're things we can build ourselves since they have nothing to do with the quality of the print. And we'd like to save ourselves as much money to pass those savings on.
LEVEL THREE
Reaching 100% of our campaign goal would bring us to level three! With this level of achievement we can squeeze in embroidery to our list of services. So we can go from just screen printing or sewing things onto garments and hats to embroidering on them! For this we'll just need a few things:

An embroidery machine. Which will be chosen based on how well Jesse managed our piggy bank (just kidding both of us are needed for the secret hand shake part of its access). Our first choice would be the better choice, in our opinion and research, The Tajima TFMX-C1501. Which is way steep and would be purchased later. But if we receive enough feedback from our community of new clothing brand/business owners, we'll opt for the more obtainable Brother P1000e for $11,000 to $15,000. At least we'll be able to bring everyone the option of embroidery sooner, with awesome prices.
And all we really need with this is a mess load of threads and some hoops to hold each type of garment. The little things we can handle!

Now what if we Super Saiyan Level Four it like our pal Goku (we hope you know who that is)? We're keeping realistic, but that's what we'd really like to see! If we see that too many folks want a less expensive route to getting their brand looking boss, making our campaign goal shoot passed 100%, then we'd have to take action.
We'll of course want to show our appreciation by upgrading everyone's perks and sending everyone gift's throughout the year! That means we'll do a little extra to make you happy about your perk.
Please, let's get into what we can give you for your contribution!
  What You Get & Then SomeWe put together some gifts we hope you'll like in return for your contribution. We're still allowed 5 more perks to offer, so if you'd like to make one up using our current perks as a basis, we're open to suggestions! And if you'd like something slightly different on a certain perk, we'll gladly do it if it's within our capability. Just let us know! 
Before we start, note that every perk comes with:

Your Name listed on our site's ""About us"" page for life, as a contributor. You may have a link and a message with it as well! (good backlink opportunity for page rank, wink)
Every listed contributor on our site will automatically receive a lifetime 7% discount. Any discount that comes with a perk is extra!
Every Contributor listed will also be placed on a special email list that we'll use to send future gifts when we're well established. We'll never forget who's helping us to get to where we want to be.

So contribute to earn these as well as claiming one of the below:
1. JUST FOR GOOD GESTURE, $1
Everything counts, and with enough of these we can accumulate some back up if things go sour! So with this we're offering just our great appreciation and 15% off your entire first cart full of neat customized things. And that's on top of your lifetime 7% discount! :)

2. A GESTURE DESERVING OF A HUG, $5
Enough of these REALLY gets us some back up cushion, and we'll be indebted to you for sure. Claim this and you'll get 25% off your first cart with your 7% lifetime discount. A whopping 32%!


3. LIFETIME COUPON KEY CHAIN, $10
Claim this perk to boost your lifetime discount by 10 making it 17%! Not only that, you get a sweet Rugged Edge plush key chain the shape of our logo's turtle  (we're sorry for not having a pic yet!). Or choose a name tape key chain with your name or custom message! Our plush key chain is exclusive to this campaign, so this will be the only way to ever claim one of these. Claiming more than one of these allows you to give key chains (with their discounts) to friends but does not allow you to stack discounts. Sorry! Just let us know your choice and details when ordering or email us at projects@ruggedge.com 


4. CUSTOM PRINTED PRODUCT, $25
Claim this to make your lifetime discount 22%! We've selected 8 products for you to choose from, and for us to print on. Choose from: 1) T-shirt 2) Long sleeve t-shirt 3) Tank top 4) Sleeve-less shirt 5) Sweatshirt 6) Youth size shirt 7) Tote A 8) Tote B. Send your design to projects@ruggedge.com . The product will be printed using the DTG capabilities we'll acquire from reaching level one. Then you'll have a feel of the quality the Brother GT-381 can produce! Also, along with this perk and any other beyond this perk, you'll receive a personal thank you letter from us with our signature. Probably typed since we have boot camp hand writing, but we'll see! 




5. HELP OUR TURTLE FRIENDS TEE, $25
Instead of claiming a custom product, sport our exclusive protect the sea turtle shirt and we'll add $5 to our end of campaign donation to the Sea Turtle Conservancy in Florida! Now you're twice as generous and still walk away with a 22% lifetime discount and t-shirt. The shirt will be printed using the DTG method.
We chose the Conservancy because they focus strictly on our mascot's sea turtle friends and operate right in our backyard! They work to prevent everything that threatens sea turtles in hopes to remove them from the endangered species list, and we like that! We'll be able to continue our contribution to them through our printing, with your help. Sea turtles are too cool of a species to let them die out from poachers and pollution! If you're ever in Melbourne, FL. visit the turtles at the Barrier Island Center!



6. THE EVER HELPFUL CONTRIBUTION, $25
We're extremely eager to give back, I think we planned this more than our actual company. We spoke of many neat things we want to do. Claim this perk to send the Wounded Warrior Project or the NMCRS $10 and receive our plush key chain while turning your +15% discount into a lifetime code that forwards 15% of a sale to one of them or to the Sea Turtle Conservancy, anytime you or whomever you give it to uses it! Why not? You'll still have a 7% discount to your name! Our comrades made life pleasant during our time in service, we'd like to return the favor. Let us know which organization you want your code to support when ordering this perk.
7. SWEET VECTOR-PACKED FLASH DRIVE, $35
Ready for our geek side? Organize all of your designs on an 8GB flash drive for use on the go or with us!

The vector files will be various design elements like: clowns, vehicles, wings, flames, sports, mock ups, and more. Use them to get your brand designs started or for your commercial projects!



8. ONE TIME LABOR WAIVER, $50
Have a labor waiver in the back of your pocket to slap us with when putting in an order or project. That means you'll only pay for the materials! Don't worry, we're accustomed to hard work from our time in service. We'll gladly support your future cause by printing your products using the very equipment you contributed toward today! With this waiver, you can potentially get screen printed shirts for your cause as low as $3 each!



9. GET YOUR VERY OWN NAVY-INSPIRED RUGGED EDGE UNIFORM, $85
Claim this perk and you'll be donning our navy-inspired uniform before we get to! We'll be rocking these babies when we're doing our thing in the print shop. Your uniform will come with our company name embroidered above its left chest pocket, and your first or last name above the right chest pocket. This is our ""it's okay to get dirty"" uniform. You can also ask to have your own company name or text instead, even change text color (silver is default)! You will receive a belt and buckle to go with it! You think your 15% lifetime discount went away? Not at all! Enjoy 22% off for life. Also, anyone who owns a pair lands on our VIP list for access to our future facility twice a year. You'll receive on site training on our equipment and free usage! You can always opt for further discounts instead. See perk for size info.






10. LET US BUILD YOU TWO CUSTOM SCREENS, $100
Claim these and you can screen print your own garments for your friends, work, or group! Then all you'll need are some hinges from the hardware store, a table, and paint! The screens will be high quality aluminum for longevity and to deter warping but if you want wood that's okay, just ask. The screen size will be 20 in. x 24 in. but the max design size we will do is 16 in. x 20 in. for the best possible print (tension is greater around the edges of a screen, so paint registration is less as you get closer to edges!). Choose between 156 or 230 mesh, and send your design to projects@ruggedge.com. (156 mesh is for general purpose screen printing but with a little better detail than 110 mesh. 156 is used for laying down base color or thick layers. 230 mesh is for finer detail, like halftones.

11. GET 20 CUSTOM SHIRTS, $200
Grab 20 friends and send us 20 designs to get some shirts made at $10 each! Same DTG method and options from the other perk! We'll even help out with your designs by sending you a collection of vector files to use. This deal won't come from anywhere else! None of our deals will!
12. HAND MADE REPLICA MK 76 LAMP, $200

Get a taste of our services with a lamp, made custom by us, the
Rugged team, using recycled metals. A life size replica of the typical training weapon
used by us while serving in the Navy. The actual practice weapon is used to
train pilots in the delivery of the live general purpose bomb it’s designed to
simulate. Our jobs as Ordnancemen were to assemble and load these puppies onto
combat aircraft.
Your lamp will be sculpted and shaped using mostly recycled
aluminum cans, sanded and painted, then wired to serve as an accent lamp or
conversation piece. By default, we will paint the bomb body to resemble the
general purpose MK-80 series it was designed for (as shown in the
image). We are leaning toward accepting custom color, base, and shade requests
and will contact you for them near the end of our campaign.
We’re making these lamps during this campaign only! Each
will be stenciled “Made Specially For (recipient)”. At the conclusion of this
campaign these will no longer be available unless someone else decides to
reproduce them! -They can also be converted into a vase or other creative ideas upon request.-



13. CUSTOM AUTOMATED WEBSITE, $500
Claim this and we'll set you up with a website using the popular WordPress platform! We'll install your site onto your hosting account (we can recommend a few good ones for you based on your needs). We'll set the site up with your products or some neat mock ups and banners. Set it up to work automatically by notifying us when an order is placed on it, then we can print that order and ship it to your customer. We'll customize the look and your store emails. Add a few features, integrate your social networks, setup your free newsletter, etc. And lastly, walk you through setting up your payment gateways so your customers can pay you! Our goal for our service is to make this possible (opening an online shop for just the cost of hosting). You can easily learn to do this yourself through many forums and Google searches, so you can potentially start your shop for the cost of a $5 hosting plan! If you want to contribute to our cause however, we'll take care of the tedious stuff for you, get this perk!



14. GET 100 CUSTOM SHIRTS, $700
That's right! We'll print 100 shirts for you using the direct-to-garment method from our $25 perk. Except you'll be saving BIG TIME at $7 a shirt! As many different color and size options as you want, print 100 different designs if you'd like! Sell them at your shop, shows or give them away. Send your artwork to projects@ruggedge.com and include shirt colors, sizes and what designs go on which. Shirts will be Gildan brand, and we can remove tags free of charge if you wish!

15. BIG BALLER STATUS PERK, $1,000
We're not able to give you a percentage of sales like we want to :(!  But they say we can definitely give you discounts! So for your generous contribution, we'll extend to you a generous coupon for $1,500 off an order with us. It will not be redeemable until 2017 though! You can gift it, split it up, or just make yourself a pile of custom merchandise. Use it over time to send off personalized gifts for holidays and birthdays directly from our shop to them! 
You will receive a LIFETIME labor waiver! Your VIP pass to avoiding all extra costs associated with screen printers. 4 times a year, we'll complete your order for just the cost of the materials and you're welcome to send your own materials to save more! 
Your advertisement or message will be placed in every one of our packages shipped (to our customers, not our user's customers) for a year. Send us the ad or have us design one for you, free. 
You will receive a thank you box of goodies once a year for as long as we're around! You can choose to redirect this gift elsewhere at any time. 
And any other ways we can show our thanks to you in the future. Or you can tell us to leave you alone already. :)

Anyone with just a thought of starting a brand or something similar, can do so knowing there's a place to do it all with no money to start. And with the best quality, it'll be the best decision.

We want to bring the Guatemalan textile market directly to you.  With your help, we can create a marketplace that gives you access to beautiful and unique items while allowing women weavers to achieve fair wages and a better standard of living.

Handwoven Ties
This is one of the patterns that our neckties will be in, they will be available in three colors - red, green, and blue.
We are also working on other striped patterns with pastel type colors, but images aren't available yet becuase the textiles are going to take about another week to hand weave.

Here is a prototype of our self tie bowtie.  We will have a solid green, solid blue, and striped pattern tie.

 
Handwoven Scarf
 
Belts From Handwoven Fabrics
With your help, we can make D-ring style belts with these handwoven designs! Will be available in green, red, and blue.


 
About Us
Founded by a couple of college students with a passion for travel, volunteerism, and entrepreneurship, Vern Clothing's mission is to bring exquisite hand-woven and hand stitched clothing to the hands of people who wouldn't otherwise have access to these goods. 
The artisans and weavers that we work with don't have access to markets in Europe and the United States. They are forced to sell their work on the street or markets to the few tourists that wander by. It is our mission to connect these weavers with the world so that they can finally get fair wages and achieve a better standard of living.",6.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3><b>Ashley Nelson and Jacqui Nicholson are old CCC Choir friends.</b></h3>
<h3><b>We started Manasole when we both agreed that men didn’t have many clothing websites that made shopping hassle free. We weren’t going to
settle for another site that had men browsing through tons of items spending
countless minutes trying to find what they wanted and needed.</b></h3>
<h3><b>Not wasting any time, Jacqui' began researching on what was already out there and she met with Ashley over coffee to explain the concept. Ashley was fully on board, and we both started working with some of the best designers/manufacturers to create a spring line that would be versatile yet exciting.</b></h3>
<h3><b>Some of our manufacturers produce clothing for Brooks Brothers, Pink Dolphin, and even JCPenny. After working hard on the fit and making sure we offered sizes up to a mens 3x, we are now here ready to bring the vision to life!</b></h3>

It may seem shocking that two Chicago women are working hard to take the guesswork out of men’s
clothing; but we saw several companies which make shopping personal and convenient for women and did not understand why men were being left out.



Manasole is a personalized shopping experience for men of every style. We offer customized monthly subscriptions and personal style advice. We are dedicated to delivering quality clothing and accessories to men while being courteous to both their time and wallet.  Manasole is for the man who loves to shop, hates to shop, or does not have time to shop.








1. Signing up is easy and seamless. Sign in with facebook or create an account at www.manasole.com (coming soon!)


 2. Enter your style preference so we can customize your clothing options! We offer sizes small to 3X.



3. Visit your customized Man Cave and start shopping! One-click shop the entire outfit we select for you, sign up to receive select clothing items and accessories monthly or browse the entire season's collection!






At Manasole we are committed to quality. We strive to use premium cotton blends and the best materials for all of our clothing and accessories. We are working with some of the best mills around the world to get the perfect fit and offer extended sizes so we can make your personalized shopping experience a great one! 
The average price for an item at Manasole is $32. That means you can purchase an entire outfit for under $100.









         

         




       






                                                 
                               








We have already worked with seasoned Chicago designers to put together a great Spring 2014 collection! We were able to produce samples for our models in order to put together a great photo shoot! Your contributions will help us to meet our first goal of $18,000, which will allow us to go into immediate production with our spring clothing so that we can launch in April of 2014. We like to dream big so we have laid out a few ""stretch goals"" along the way. 






We want to send you some great Manasole Gear just in time for the holidays as a special thanks for you support. 

               




                        




                
           
                            



          
              
                    


                       











   
























To offer a personalized shopping experience to the career oriented male.


To deliver quality apparel and accessories.


To be courteous to both your time and wallet.

To give the best customer service on a personal level.




Ashley Nelson and Jacqui Nicholson are old CCC Choir friends.
We started Manasole when we both agreed that men didn’t have many clothing websites that made shopping hassle free. We weren’t going to
settle for another site that had men browsing through tons of items spending
countless minutes trying to find what they wanted and needed.
Not wasting any time, Jacqui' began researching on what was already out there and she met with Ashley over coffee to explain the concept. Ashley was fully on board, and we both started working with some of the best designers/manufacturers to create a spring line that would be versatile yet exciting.
Some of our manufacturers produce clothing for Brooks Brothers, Pink Dolphin, and even JCPenny. After working hard on the fit and making sure we offered sizes up to a mens 3x, we are now here ready to bring the vision to life!

     







Designers that have helped us along the way: Wendy Callupe, Rachel BarePhotographer: Marcin Tomasczyk- mardynnphoto.comVideographer: Matthew Messner- matthewmessner.comGraphic Designers- Noa Scheininger, Christian TanModels- Nathaniel Andrew, Kendahl Ancheta, Rick Sindt, Partrick Viray
Hair/Makeup-Milica Pavlovic, Cristina Gomez








Our team has worked hard to mitigate the risks and
challenges of this project. One of our challenges will be to introduce the Manasole
brand to our customers. This is why we worked hard in creating a strong name
that our customers would be proud to wear.

We’ve gone through an 8-month development process to ensure
that we bring the best shopping service to our men. Having tested out the
products we are offering, we can guarantee that you will love the clothing just
as much as we do.


As there may be delays in the process, we will be sure to
communicate effectively to all of our backers so that our reward fulfillment
stays right on track.

<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>Based in Brooklyn, NY, we are a husband and wife team who decided to pursue the American Dream by creating a socially responsible brand that combines our passion for fashion and animal compassion. ZoLa, named after our rescued dogs Zoey and Lani, is a new breed of clothing that fuses American fashion classics with a social mission focused on animal welfare/rescue.</p>
<p>ZoLa celebrates the human-animal bond and through our Be Awear movement, supports critical animal welfare organizations that ensure our animal friends live exceptional and healthy lives. Through our philanthropic mission, ZoLa will give 10% of the price of each product sold to local animal welfare and rescue organizations. Buy ZoLa. Help a dog.</p>
<p>The resilience of rescued animals to live happy and fulfilling lives after overcoming abandonment and struggles inspires us all to live life good and to the fullest. ZoLa specializes in the qualities that define an underdog - strength, resilience, compassion - and crafts products for those who exemplify these values.</p>

<p><strong>For every product purchased, ZoLa will give 10% of the price to select local animal welfare and rescue organizations. Buy ZoLa. Help a Dog.</strong></p>
<p>We have a lifelong appreciation for pets and being involved in animal welfare causes. Rescuing Lani as a puppy from a kill shelter in South Carolina was one of the most impactful moments that inspired our commitment to animal welfare. When a frail Lani with her fur coat hugging her ribs was handed to me by Lucky Dog Animal Rescue volunteers, she was shaking with fear as she had clearly lived a life of abuse and malnourishment. No animal deserves to be treated in such a way or have their life cut short and we created ZoLa to help provide our animal friends the life they deserve.</p>
<p>Everybody loves an underdog story and is inspired by those who have overcome obstacles to live the good life. ZoLa provides a platform to share these stories and galvanize the global community of animal lovers to help eradicate inhumane animal treatment.</p>
<p>What we wear is a defining part of who we are, what we value and how we express ourselves. Luxury fashion has been traditionally manufactured by name-brand designers who have profited at the expense of animals and poor garment workers worldwide. ZoLa's business model is based on the belief that there is no reason why premium fashion should not have a double bottom line and positive social impact. Simply put, stylish clothing should come in an animal-friendly and socially responsible form.</p>
<h2>Our partners</h2>
<p>ZoLa is working with a select group of founding partners to pioneer our brand and provide consumers with an understanding of our Be Awear social mission. Through our Be Awear movement, ZoLa will help expand awareness for our partners' and similar animal welfare/rescue organization missions and donate 10% of the net funds raised from this campaign and the price of each product sold to save and support animals rescued by these important organizations. We are proud that our founding partners are animal rescue organizations that we hold close to our hearts:</p>
<p><strong>BARC (Brooklyn Animal Resource Coalition)</strong>. BARC is a not-for-profit, no-kill animal shelter located in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. BARC's mission is to provide a safe haven for abandoned animals and to find permanent loving homes for them. </p>

<p><strong>Lucky Dog Animal Rescue. </strong>Based in Washington, D.C., Lucky Dog Animal Rescue is an all-volunteer, non-profit animal rescue organization dedicated to saving the lives of homeless animals. Lucky Dog rescues dogs from high-kill shelters and finds them loving forever homes. Lucky Dog holds a special place in our hearts as we rescued Lani from Lucky Dog who saved her from a high-kill shelter in South Carolina.</p>

<h2>Where we are now</h2>
<p>We have spent the last year building our business plan, perfecting our designs and samples and vetting and arranging our supply chain. We have received considerable feedback from our friends, local community and industry leaders and we thank all those who have contributed their input. We are launching our inaugural men's Underdog Polo Shirt in 3 color combinations:</p>
<ul>
<li>White polo shirt with white english bulldog logo</li>
<li>Navy blue polo shirt with gray english bulldog logo</li>
<li>Black polo shirt with white english bulldog logo</li>
</ul><p>Sizes offered: S, M, L, XL, XXL</p>
<p>Our prototype samples have been developed and received rave reviews from friends, customers, and fashion designers for their design, craftsmanship and distinctiveness.</p>
<p>All materials have been sourced and their prices have been negotiated with suppliers and manufacturers.</p>
<p>We have partnered with a premier designer and ethical, WRAP-certified manufacturer who produces fabric and apparel for some of the top global fashion brands. Our Underdog Polo Shirts are one step away from production and we need your financial support to launch.</p>
<h2>Why we need your support and what you get</h2>
<p>We are looking to raise a minimum of $12,000. Your support will help fund our first production run of Underdog Polo Shirts. <strong>In addition, 10% of the net funds raised will be donated to our Founding Partners - BARC and Lucky Dog Animal Rescue</strong>. Any amount of money would be helpful and what you receive in return for your pledge depends on your level of support. Those participating in the $50+ pledge levels are receiving atleast 1 Underdog Polo Shirt at a substantial discount off the retail price of our polo shirts (retail value of $89) plus FREE SHIPPING in the US due to your support as a founding sponsor.</p>
<p>In addition to your financial support, we also need your help spreading the word about ZoLa. ZoLa is not only a new breed of fashion, it's a movement. We started ZoLa because we believe in the power of the underdog. More importantly, we believe in the power of the underdog to use fashion to create social change.</p>
<p>If you believe in the power of the underdog and like ZoLa and what we are about, please share ZoLa with your family and friends and help enlist others to join the Be Awear movement. As your support through this campaign will help fund our initial production run, that makes you a pioneer. Pioneers set the standard - so join us, wear your support proudly and share our mission with the masses as we emBARK on this most righteous venture.</p>

<h2><span><strong>Background on Nick<span class=""apple-converted-space""> </span></strong></span></h2>
<p><span><br/> Hailing from modest roots in the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., my family (wife Jordan, newborn son Dylan and 2 rescued dogs Zoey and Lani) moved to New York City to pursue the American Dream after completing my MBA at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business with an emphasis on social entrepreneurship.</span></p>
<p><span>As lifelong pet enthusiasts and animal lovers, Jordan and I decided to combine our passion for fashion, animal compassion and socially responsible business to launch a new luxury fashion brand - ZoLa. Our business model is based on the belief that there is no reason why premium fashion should not have a double bottom line and positive social impact.</span></p>
<p><span>We started ZoLa because we believe in the power of the underdog. More importantly, we believe in the power of the underdog to use fashion to create social change. ZoLa specializes in the qualities that define an underdog - strength, resilience, compassion - and crafts products for those that exemplify these values. As the first in my family to have attended college, I can relate a great deal to the underdog mindset and struggles that underdogs face in overcoming obstacles.</span></p>
<p><span>For us, our Be Awear social mission is a very personal one. We have a lifelong appreciation for pets and being involved in animal welfare causes. Rescuing Lani as a puppy from a kill shelter, we witnessed firsthand the great work that these animal welfare/rescue organizations and their volunteers perform on a daily basis. These organizations give animals hope, love, an escape from euthanasia and mistreatment and find them caring homes. Wanting to help, we created ZoLa's Be Awear social mission to expand awareness for these causes and galvanize the global community of underdogs and animal lovers. With your help, we can all do a little bit more to give our animal friends the life they deserve.</span></p>

Our name
ZoLa was named after our two rescued dogs, Zoey and Lani (pictured below). 

Zoey is a brown Miniature Pinscher who we rescued from Animal Welfare League of Arlington. Zoey is the real-life embodiment of Scrappy Doo - her ""let me at 'em"" approach to life inspired us to launch ZoLa.
Lani is a black Miniature Pinscher mix who we adopted from Lucky Dog Animal Rescue. Lucky Dog rescued Lani from a high kill shelter. Rescuing Lani inspired us to launch ZoLa with a social mission focused on animal welfare/rescue 
Our inaugural product - the Underdog Polo Shirt
ZoLa's inaugural product, the Underdog Polo Shirt, combines meticulous design, craftsmanship and the finest materials with a distinctive logo and story that embodies ZoLa's core values and social mission.
Panache meets purpose with this conscious American fashion classic that is full of character. Our signature men's Underdog Polo shirt is fashioned from the finest Peruvian pima cotton with a comfortable fit and feel.










 

 
The Underdog Polo Shirt is a true ""Best of Breed"" in style, quality and craftsmanship. The design features:

Made from luxurious 100% Peruvian Pima cotton in a custom-engineered high thread count lightweight pique knit with an uber-soft and comfortable feel. The high thread count and feel of the fabric is unlike any other polo shirt on the market!
The custom tailored fit is a slim fit that was carefully crafted and designed through extensive research on the most desirable fit characteristics of consumers.
The 2-button placket is accentuated with laser-engraved buttons with ZoLa's name.
Rib knit collar and cuffs
The seams, trim and interior lining are taped and reinforced with twill stripes encompassing ZoLa's signature color - sky and sand.
Uneven hem and side gusset that is longer in the back than in the front so the shirt stays tucked in
Our signature regal English Bulldog logo embroidered on the chest has a story of its own and is a true conversation piece.










Our inaugural Underdog Polo Shirt collection is for men. A women's collection of Underdog Polo Shirts will be made available soon after launching our men's collection.
Our inaugural logo - the English Bulldog


The English Bulldog personifies the characteristics of an underdog - a kind and equable disposition, resolute and courageous with a pacific and dignified demeanor. The English Bulldog symbolizes the juxtaposition of a scrappy and headstrong appearance with a sense of regalness and humility.
The dogged pursuit of happiness and overcoming obstacles to live a distinguished and righteous life is the ultimate mark of an underdog. The Bulldog was originally bred for bull-baiting in the 1500s and as such had to be courageous and impervious to pain. The evolution of this fine breed to overcome its ferocious origins and early mistreatment to become one of the most gentle and adored breeds inspires us all to approach any challenge with the same tenacity and humility.
Our logo features a stocky English Bulldog with its head held high complemented with ZoLa's signature red neckscarf.
Each season, ZoLa will further honor the human-animal bond by introducing a new limited edition dog breed logo collection with a unique story. 
Our mission - Be Awear

For every product purchased, ZoLa will give 10% of the price to select local animal welfare and rescue organizations. Buy ZoLa. Help a Dog.
We have a lifelong appreciation for pets and being involved in animal welfare causes. Rescuing Lani as a puppy from a kill shelter in South Carolina was one of the most impactful moments that inspired our commitment to animal welfare. When a frail Lani with her fur coat hugging her ribs was handed to me by Lucky Dog Animal Rescue volunteers, she was shaking with fear as she had clearly lived a life of abuse and malnourishment. No animal deserves to be treated in such a way or have their life cut short and we created ZoLa to help provide our animal friends the life they deserve.
Everybody loves an underdog story and is inspired by those who have overcome obstacles to live the good life. ZoLa provides a platform to share these stories and galvanize the global community of animal lovers to help eradicate inhumane animal treatment.
What we wear is a defining part of who we are, what we value and how we express ourselves. Luxury fashion has been traditionally manufactured by name-brand designers who have profited at the expense of animals and poor garment workers worldwide. ZoLa's business model is based on the belief that there is no reason why premium fashion should not have a double bottom line and positive social impact. Simply put, stylish clothing should come in an animal-friendly and socially responsible form.
Our partners
ZoLa is working with a select group of founding partners to pioneer our brand and provide consumers with an understanding of our Be Awear social mission. Through our Be Awear movement, ZoLa will help expand awareness for our partners' and similar animal welfare/rescue organization missions and donate 10% of the net funds raised from this campaign and the price of each product sold to save and support animals rescued by these important organizations. We are proud that our founding partners are animal rescue organizations that we hold close to our hearts:
BARC (Brooklyn Animal Resource Coalition). BARC is a not-for-profit, no-kill animal shelter located in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. BARC's mission is to provide a safe haven for abandoned animals and to find permanent loving homes for them. 

Lucky Dog Animal Rescue. Based in Washington, D.C., Lucky Dog Animal Rescue is an all-volunteer, non-profit animal rescue organization dedicated to saving the lives of homeless animals. Lucky Dog rescues dogs from high-kill shelters and finds them loving forever homes. Lucky Dog holds a special place in our hearts as we rescued Lani from Lucky Dog who saved her from a high-kill shelter in South Carolina.

Where we are now
We have spent the last year building our business plan, perfecting our designs and samples and vetting and arranging our supply chain. We have received considerable feedback from our friends, local community and industry leaders and we thank all those who have contributed their input. We are launching our inaugural men's Underdog Polo Shirt in 3 color combinations:

White polo shirt with white english bulldog logo
Navy blue polo shirt with gray english bulldog logo
Black polo shirt with white english bulldog logo
Sizes offered: S, M, L, XL, XXL
Our prototype samples have been developed and received rave reviews from friends, customers, and fashion designers for their design, craftsmanship and distinctiveness.
All materials have been sourced and their prices have been negotiated with suppliers and manufacturers.
We have partnered with a premier designer and ethical, WRAP-certified manufacturer who produces fabric and apparel for some of the top global fashion brands. Our Underdog Polo Shirts are one step away from production and we need your financial support to launch.
Why we need your support and what you get
We are looking to raise a minimum of $12,000. Your support will help fund our first production run of Underdog Polo Shirts. In addition, 10% of the net funds raised will be donated to our Founding Partners - BARC and Lucky Dog Animal Rescue. Any amount of money would be helpful and what you receive in return for your pledge depends on your level of support. Those participating in the $50+ pledge levels are receiving atleast 1 Underdog Polo Shirt at a substantial discount off the retail price of our polo shirts (retail value of $89) plus FREE SHIPPING in the US due to your support as a founding sponsor.
In addition to your financial support, we also need your help spreading the word about ZoLa. ZoLa is not only a new breed of fashion, it's a movement. We started ZoLa because we believe in the power of the underdog. More importantly, we believe in the power of the underdog to use fashion to create social change.
If you believe in the power of the underdog and like ZoLa and what we are about, please share ZoLa with your family and friends and help enlist others to join the Be Awear movement. As your support through this campaign will help fund our initial production run, that makes you a pioneer. Pioneers set the standard - so join us, wear your support proudly and share our mission with the masses as we emBARK on this most righteous venture.

Background on Nick 
 Hailing from modest roots in the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., my family (wife Jordan, newborn son Dylan and 2 rescued dogs Zoey and Lani) moved to New York City to pursue the American Dream after completing my MBA at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business with an emphasis on social entrepreneurship.
As lifelong pet enthusiasts and animal lovers, Jordan and I decided to combine our passion for fashion, animal compassion and socially responsible business to launch a new luxury fashion brand - ZoLa. Our business model is based on the belief that there is no reason why premium fashion should not have a double bottom line and positive social impact.
We started ZoLa because we believe in the power of the underdog. More importantly, we believe in the power of the underdog to use fashion to create social change. ZoLa specializes in the qualities that define an underdog - strength, resilience, compassion - and crafts products for those that exemplify these values. As the first in my family to have attended college, I can relate a great deal to the underdog mindset and struggles that underdogs face in overcoming obstacles.
For us, our Be Awear social mission is a very personal one. We have a lifelong appreciation for pets and being involved in animal welfare causes. Rescuing Lani as a puppy from a kill shelter, we witnessed firsthand the great work that these animal welfare/rescue organizations and their volunteers perform on a daily basis. These organizations give animals hope, love, an escape from euthanasia and mistreatment and find them caring homes. Wanting to help, we created ZoLa's Be Awear social mission to expand awareness for these causes and galvanize the global community of underdogs and animal lovers. With your help, we can all do a little bit more to give our animal friends the life they deserve.

<p dir=""ltr"">Waveborn sunglasses are designed and handcrafted in Italy, and we sell them at a price point well below typical designer brands. For each pair of sunglasses sold, Waveborn helps a person in need in one of two ways: a) we provide a new pair of prescription eyeglasses through our nonprofit partner Unite for Sight, or b) we fund a portion of a vision-restoring cataract surgery for a person in need though our new nonprofit partner Surgical Eye Expeditions (SEE) International.</p>

<div>
<span>With less than 48 hours to go, we've decided to raise the bar and set the new stretch goal of $25,000: 250% of our original plan. With these funds</span><span> we’ll be able to expand the Waveborn line and help an additional 100+ people in need of vision care.</span>
</div>
<div><span> </span></div>
<div><span>We've also added a $30 perk- do more good while protecting your eyes.</span></div>
<p dir=""ltr"">Be the change you wish to see in this world!</p>
<p dir=""ltr""> </p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"">Announcing our first Stretch Goal: $20,000</h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">After reaching our initial goal of $10,000 we've set a stretch goal of $20,000! </p>
<p>What will we be able to do if we get to our goal of $20,000? Two key things: First, we will be able to create four new styles/colors of Waveborns as well as some special edition shades in some exciting new colors! Second, if we reach our goal of $20,000 we will fund an additional 20 sight restoring cataract surgeries with SEE International, on top of the surgeries we've already committed to support.</p>
<p>Please help us meet this new goal by spreading the Waveborn word!</p>

<h2 style=""font-size: 1.17em;""><strong><strong> <img alt=""Unite For Sight"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/771575/pictures/original/20130422231956-u4s.jpeg?1366698000"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></strong></h2>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>Unite For Sight</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><a href=""http://www.uniteforsight.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Unite For Sight</a> supports eye clinics worldwide by investing human and financial resources in their social ventures to eliminate patient barriers to eye care. With their remarkable local partner eye clinics, Unite for Sight has provided eye care to 1,000,000+ patients living in extreme poverty. Unite for Sight is like the Peace Corps for eye clinics. People sign up to go abroad for a year or two to places like Ghana, Honduras, or India.<br/></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Unight For Sight typically sets up eye clinics in rural villages for patients who have never had an eye exam before in their life. When a patient comes to the clinic, they are prescribed their first pair of eyeglasses, which are given to the partient for free. Together we'll help keep their shelves stocked every time we sell a pair of Waveborns.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""> </p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 1.17em;""><strong><strong> <img alt=""SEE International"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/771574/pictures/original/20130422231854-mxiQZicDdOBUAiRYnlC1di8Z58aglqk2tt1yR2YBa0g.jpeg?1366697938"" src="""" style="""" title=""SEE International""/></strong></strong></h2>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>Surgical Eye Expeditions (SEE) International</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>As Waveborn continued to grow in a variety of ways in 2013, it made sense to also expand our social good component. Thus we formed a great new partnership with <a href=""http://www.seeintl.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SEE International</a>, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit humanitarian organization that utilizes volunteer ophthalmic surgeons to provide sight-restoring surgery to individuals worldwide. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Based in Santa Barbara, CA SEE International provides the link between hundreds of volunteer eye surgeons and thousands of patients in over 37 countries every year. When you choose to give to SEE International after buying Waveborn shades, we fund a portion of one of their sight-restoring cataract surgeries.</span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"">Choose your giving model</h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>We’ve expanded our giving model! Now our customers can choose their impact and decide how they want to give the gift of sight. With each purchase, Waveborn customers will be able to provide a new pair of prescription eyeglasses or fund a portion of a vision-restoring cataract surgery for a person in need through our nonprofit partners! We will send out a survey to campaign backers in a few weeks to allow them to select which organization they want to donate to.<br/></span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 1.17em;""><strong><strong><img alt=""Be a part of something greater"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/771577/pictures/original/20130422232311-92_cWTAfiCktFvEbnzlCzi-6cdBDrMUxyGvg46T9GxE.jpeg?1366698190"" src="""" style="""" title=""Be a part of something greater""/> </strong></strong></h2>
<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>Why we need your support </span></h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>We started Waveborn not knowing exactly what kind of response we’d get. Would people like our shades? Would they care about our mission to help people around the world who lack the resources to treat their vision problems? As we found out, the answer to both questions was a resounding “Yes!” And now we’re ready to take that momentum and turn it into real growth.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><img alt=""Beach girl"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/771470/pictures/original/20130422220713-Beach_girl_1.png?1366693640"" src="""" style="""" title=""Beach girl""/></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"">And that's where you come in...</h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Designing, ordering, manufacturing, and selling sunglasses at a sustainable price takes a significant upfront investment. By backing our campaign, you’ll allow us to order more sunglasses in your favorite styles and to finally add polarized lenses to our most popular models. Specifically if we reach our goal of $10,000 we’ll be able to order two batches of sunglasses in new styles and colors and be able to provide hundreds of people with the gift of sight!</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In short, more outreach = more sales = more new sunglasses = more people around the world to whom we can give the gift of sight! The more support we get, the more shades we can sell, and the more people we can help!</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>We crushed our goal of $10,000 in the first two days, and now we are setting up some stretch goals to achieve over the next week, month, and duration of the campaign. The sky is the limit! <br/></span></p>
<h2 dir=""ltr"">The Waveborn Look</h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>We’ve put a lot of effort into making a pair of shades for every face. Thrillist.com described our unisex flagship model, the Marinas, as “slightly sportier versions of Ray-Ban’s classic Wayfarer design.” </span></p>

<h2 dir=""ltr"">What's Our Story?</h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>So who are we? The core <a href=""http://wiki.waveborn.com/the-team"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""The Team"">Waveborn team</a> is comprised of one guy named Jonathan and three Mikes (our email messages get super confusing!). In short, we’re four guys who love awesome sunglasses, but don't love spending $200+ per pair. We also love the feeling of building a company that’s having an a true global impact.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Jonathan is a career social entrepreneur who spent a few years working in CA before moving to NYC to work for DoSomething.org, where he served as the Executive Producer for the 2010 Do Something Awards. Jonathan then moved to DC with his beautiful wife, Jenna, where he founded Waveborn while getting his MBA at UMD. Mike Malloy is a pro frisbee player who travels the world selling sunglasses and helping people. Malloy spent four years working for Deloitte Consulting while completing his M.S. in computer science at Georgetown. He graduated in May 2012 and quit in June to move to Dewey Beach, DE for the summer to spend his days selling Waveborn shades, growing the business, and enjoying the Dewey Beach way of life.</span></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span>Mike Forgit was computer science lab partners with Malloy at BC, and he was hired quickly after Malloy realized he never wanted to write another line of code in his life. Forgit is our stellar tech guru, managing our website, e-commerce platform, and any other tech related projects. Mike F. lives just outside Boston with his wife and adorable daughter. Mike McCormick is a finance/startup dude and Georgetown grad, who now resides in San Francisco. McCormick, who was born with cataracts, is passionate about helping people in poor countries who were born with the same disease, which leads to blindness if untreated. Together we are striving to have a real impact for people around the world struggling with access to vision-care.</span></p>
<h2 dir=""ltr"">Handcrafted in Italy</h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Made in a small town just north of Milan, Italy, Waveborn sunglasses are <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEVe1IA1Yck"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Made in Italy"">manufactured to the highest standards</a>.

<p dir=""ltr""><em>A: Our early bird backers will have the option to select a pair from our remaining spring line and receive them by Memorial Day.

Waveborn sunglasses are designed and handcrafted in Italy, and we sell them at a price point well below typical designer brands. For each pair of sunglasses sold, Waveborn helps a person in need in one of two ways: a) we provide a new pair of prescription eyeglasses through our nonprofit partner Unite for Sight, or b) we fund a portion of a vision-restoring cataract surgery for a person in need though our new nonprofit partner Surgical Eye Expeditions (SEE) International.
 

NEW Stetch Goal: $25,000


With less than 48 hours to go, we've decided to raise the bar and set the new stretch goal of $25,000: 250% of our original plan. With these funds we’ll be able to expand the Waveborn line and help an additional 100+ people in need of vision care.

 
We've also added a $30 perk- do more good while protecting your eyes.
Be the change you wish to see in this world!
 
Announcing our first Stretch Goal: $20,000
After reaching our initial goal of $10,000 we've set a stretch goal of $20,000! 
What will we be able to do if we get to our goal of $20,000? Two key things: First, we will be able to create four new styles/colors of Waveborns as well as some special edition shades in some exciting new colors! Second, if we reach our goal of $20,000 we will fund an additional 20 sight restoring cataract surgeries with SEE International, on top of the surgeries we've already committed to support.
Please help us meet this new goal by spreading the Waveborn word!
 
Waveborn is Officially Endorsed by The Crowdfund Mafia!
""Waveborn shades is stepping up to the plate and giving back big time. Get yourself a pair of cool Waveborn glasses and change someones life forever. A very inspiring campaign on Indiegogo."" - The Crowdfund Mafia
 
Waveborn in the Media and Awards

Our Nonprofit Partners
 
Unite For Sight
Unite For Sight supports eye clinics worldwide by investing human and financial resources in their social ventures to eliminate patient barriers to eye care. With their remarkable local partner eye clinics, Unite for Sight has provided eye care to 1,000,000+ patients living in extreme poverty. Unite for Sight is like the Peace Corps for eye clinics. People sign up to go abroad for a year or two to places like Ghana, Honduras, or India.
Unight For Sight typically sets up eye clinics in rural villages for patients who have never had an eye exam before in their life. When a patient comes to the clinic, they are prescribed their first pair of eyeglasses, which are given to the partient for free. Together we'll help keep their shelves stocked every time we sell a pair of Waveborns.
 
 
Surgical Eye Expeditions (SEE) International
As Waveborn continued to grow in a variety of ways in 2013, it made sense to also expand our social good component. Thus we formed a great new partnership with SEE International, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit humanitarian organization that utilizes volunteer ophthalmic surgeons to provide sight-restoring surgery to individuals worldwide. 
Based in Santa Barbara, CA SEE International provides the link between hundreds of volunteer eye surgeons and thousands of patients in over 37 countries every year. When you choose to give to SEE International after buying Waveborn shades, we fund a portion of one of their sight-restoring cataract surgeries.
Choose your giving model
We’ve expanded our giving model! Now our customers can choose their impact and decide how they want to give the gift of sight. With each purchase, Waveborn customers will be able to provide a new pair of prescription eyeglasses or fund a portion of a vision-restoring cataract surgery for a person in need through our nonprofit partners! We will send out a survey to campaign backers in a few weeks to allow them to select which organization they want to donate to.
 
Why we need your support 
We started Waveborn not knowing exactly what kind of response we’d get. Would people like our shades? Would they care about our mission to help people around the world who lack the resources to treat their vision problems? As we found out, the answer to both questions was a resounding “Yes!” And now we’re ready to take that momentum and turn it into real growth.

And that's where you come in...
Designing, ordering, manufacturing, and selling sunglasses at a sustainable price takes a significant upfront investment. By backing our campaign, you’ll allow us to order more sunglasses in your favorite styles and to finally add polarized lenses to our most popular models. Specifically if we reach our goal of $10,000 we’ll be able to order two batches of sunglasses in new styles and colors and be able to provide hundreds of people with the gift of sight!
In short, more outreach = more sales = more new sunglasses = more people around the world to whom we can give the gift of sight! The more support we get, the more shades we can sell, and the more people we can help!
We crushed our goal of $10,000 in the first two days, and now we are setting up some stretch goals to achieve over the next week, month, and duration of the campaign. The sky is the limit! 
The Waveborn Look
We’ve put a lot of effort into making a pair of shades for every face. Thrillist.com described our unisex flagship model, the Marinas, as “slightly sportier versions of Ray-Ban’s classic Wayfarer design.” 
 


New Styles
This spring we released five new models - some sporty, some more stylish - intentionally building our line to fit faces of all shapes, sizes and styles. Please see the ""Gallery"" tab above for more images of our styles.
 

 
Long story short, wearing Waveborn shades will make you look good AND feel good.
 
What's Our Story?
So who are we? The core Waveborn team is comprised of one guy named Jonathan and three Mikes (our email messages get super confusing!). In short, we’re four guys who love awesome sunglasses, but don't love spending $200+ per pair. We also love the feeling of building a company that’s having an a true global impact.
Jonathan is a career social entrepreneur who spent a few years working in CA before moving to NYC to work for DoSomething.org, where he served as the Executive Producer for the 2010 Do Something Awards. Jonathan then moved to DC with his beautiful wife, Jenna, where he founded Waveborn while getting his MBA at UMD. Mike Malloy is a pro frisbee player who travels the world selling sunglasses and helping people. Malloy spent four years working for Deloitte Consulting while completing his M.S. in computer science at Georgetown. He graduated in May 2012 and quit in June to move to Dewey Beach, DE for the summer to spend his days selling Waveborn shades, growing the business, and enjoying the Dewey Beach way of life.

Mike Forgit was computer science lab partners with Malloy at BC, and he was hired quickly after Malloy realized he never wanted to write another line of code in his life. Forgit is our stellar tech guru, managing our website, e-commerce platform, and any other tech related projects. Mike F. lives just outside Boston with his wife and adorable daughter. Mike McCormick is a finance/startup dude and Georgetown grad, who now resides in San Francisco. McCormick, who was born with cataracts, is passionate about helping people in poor countries who were born with the same disease, which leads to blindness if untreated. Together we are striving to have a real impact for people around the world struggling with access to vision-care.
Handcrafted in Italy
Made in a small town just north of Milan, Italy, Waveborn sunglasses are manufactured to the highest standards. Using high quality plastics and lenses, we deliver a product that we are proud to attach our names to.
Don’t believe us? Check out this video of Malloy throwing his Waveborns across the room to prove just how durable they are!

NEW Polarized Lenses 

One question we always get is “Do Waveborns have polarized lenses?”
With your support, we can finally say YES to that question! Our partnership with Major League Ultimate (MLU) has allowed us to order our first batch of polarized lenses this spring. With the success of this campaign, polarized Marinas are next, with the rest of the Waveborn line not far behind. 

Our polarized Zumas are the official shades of Major League Ultimate.
What exactly does “polarized” mean?
Polarized lenses eliminate reflective glare, enhance contrast between colors, and are ideal for drivers, snowboarders, or anyone who spends time on the water. All of our lenses are great, but the polarized are the cream of the crop. Here is some more info on polarized technology:

<p>It was 25 years or so ago that my friendship and business relationship began with James Farris.  Son, brother, husband, father, grandfather, sculptor, partner, and friend…these were the attributes that fueled our friendship, and perspectives that brought to life the images that became James’ body of work during his all-too-brief 63 years of influence in our lives.</p>
<p>From the onset of our friendship, we also began the collaboration of a total of 13 sculptures whereby James fulfilled his desire to create in bronze what became a series of trilogies that are today known as <em>The Appledrum Collection.</em> </p>

<p>Following the completion of <em>The Angel Trilogy</em> by James…and my part, to see to it that the molds were produced and properly secured…I suggested that perhaps the series would be suited for reproduction in the form of gold jewelry, so as to facilitate the popularity of the sculpture and lend to the success of both over time.  With James’ approval, I enlisted the help of a friend in the jewelry industry familiar with the process, resulting in pendant and earring sets in 14- karat gold.  Upon James’ inspection, as fate would have it, and although the quality of the images was spectacular, it was his desire and decision to be known as the sculptor he had become and not a jewelry designer for which he wasn’t known.  It was a wish that I was happy to honor by not pursuing the production of the series in jewelry at that time.</p>
<p>As we had for virtually all of our 25 years as friends, James and I met every other Sunday for breakfast (along with my Jean-Marie, of whom James was quite fond and she of him), giving way only to the rare conflicting engagement by either of us.  It was in October, 2010, that our happy ritual would come to an end, when James was diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer and was to pass away only two months later, on December 17, 2010. </p>
<p>I was blessed to be with James much of the time of his remaining two months, during which we shared many opportunities for goodbye’s and, of course, the manner in which I would go forward with our collaborations in James’ absence.  Oddly, perhaps, we simply never allowed for the probability that either one of us would not always be around as support for the other.  Nonetheless, that day did arrive and I am given now to pursuing the dissemination of James’ artistic gifts without him…satisfied that it is intended to be this way.  Prior to his passing, James was baptized and received first communion.  His passing was far too early, but certainly according to His plan.</p>
<p>Through one of our daily discussions, James and I arrived at a decision allowing me to proceed with the creation of a jewelry line for his body of work.  To satisfy his deep gratitude for the wonderfully compassionate treatment he received while in hospice care with the Veteran’s Administration in Phoenix, James requested only that any royalty to him, created from the success of sales with <em>The Angel Trilogy</em> jewelry line, be directed to hospice care for others, while considering the needs of veterans as may be feasible.</p>
<p>To that end, I am proud to present <em>The Angel Trilogy</em>…in celebration of James’ extraordinary talent as a sculptor…and the path we traveled together in friendship.<br/></p>

Two years later they were married. Over the years walk in love. clothing has not changed the way it sees business, it's purpose and it's future.

<p></p>
</div></div>","What we are trying to do:
Walk in love. clothing has been in business for five and a half years. We've slowly been building our business and brand to the place it is now.  Our holiday kiosk has been very successful the last three years and we're ready to take it to the next level! We've just been given the opportunity to open a store in the Park City Mall in Lancaster, PA.


What we need:
The store isn't in the best shape.  The last tenants left holes in the walls and ceiling tiles dirty and missing.  The space needs all new flooring and paint. We also need to purchase shelves, fixtures, mannequins and all the technology to run the store.  Basically, the store needs a serious overhaul! Because we are at such a young stage in our business, we need your help!


Why help?
Walk in love. clothing is in business because of the loyal support of our friends, family and fans.  We can't exist without you.  By helping us open a store you are giving us the ability to develop new products, meet more people and widen the impact we have on this world.  Our goal is to remind people of the love of Jesus - and there's no better way to do that than by being where people already are: the mall.
If you give, you get! Be sure to check out the list of perks in the sidebar!



Where will the money go?

We will use every single cent we raise toward fixing, furnishing and stocking the store. 


Other Ways You Can Help
1. Tell your friends you gave to our campaign.  By doing this you will inspire them to do the same!
2. Post this page to your facebook, twitter and blogs.
3. Wear your walk in love. shirts and apparel.

<p>I originally launched Kimberly Lewis Home in May of 2011 at The International Contemporary Furniture Fair. I debuted a collection of boutique wallpaper, 4 patterns in 2 colorways each.

<p><strong>Where will the Funds Will Go?</strong></p>
<p>If I reach my goal of $3,000 the money will be used to bring the new collection from my computer screen into actual products! I have 5 new patterns that I will  make into wallpaper. If I exceed my goal I will also be making fabric as well. I will also be printing the patterns from the first collection on a beautiful linen which will be a new addition.

<p><strong>Tell me more! Details Please!</strong></p>
<p>There are a lot of behind the scenes details that go into designing a collection. These include color matching, sampling sewn products, and strike offs. What is a strike off you ask? It is a full-sized cropped section taken from the overall image/artwork. It’s produced on the same material with the same finishing as the final product. It provides you with an exact sample of the final product.</p>
<p>I will also be using the money to help spread the word. Don't forget the marketing materials! I will be developing a look book with photos of the products, a line sheet to distribute online and in person. I will also need to make samples to give to potential clients as well as a sample book to take with me to client meetings and for trade shows. Another big part of the success of the products is getting them into the public eye, It is my goal to exhibit the new collection at a trade show in NYC where I will be able to reach buyers, press, and the media. If I go over my goal all of the money will most likely be used for trade shows since they are pricey to exhibit. </p>

<h3>Allurette - the best care for 'hand wash only' clothes</h3>

<p>In 2012 we revolutionised travel laundry by integrating a flexible washboard into a sealable, waterproof bag. The Scrubba wash bag, an ultra portable device for washing clothes on the go, was born. Now, in response to a large number of requests for a wash bag optimised for washing delicates and active wear at home, we have designed the Allurette washer. An incredibly compact device, the Allurette features  a specially engineered washboard for delicate items, and is able to achieve a machine quality wash in just minutes.  </p>

<p><strong>Who is the Allurette washer for?</strong></p>
<p>The Allurette washer is for women who are seeking a better way to safely, quickly, and effectively wash their 'hand wash only' items, from lingerie to active wear. The increasing number of delicate garments in the fashion industry highlights the need for an effective washing method that, unlike even the gentlest cycle on many washing machines, cares for our clothes without exposing them to irreparable damage. </p>
<p>The Allurette washer has been designed to make the hand washing process easy, fast, and mess-free. Small loads can be gently and effectively washed in just minutes. It is perfect for fashion-lovers, parents who need to wash baby clothes, active women, the environmentally-conscious, and travellers. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487154140/hxghmtal7uuwxktfd9ud.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>The Allurette gentle washer will help you:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Save time: </strong>Small loads can be washed in the Allurette washer in just a few minutes.  No more messy soaking or waiting for the washing machine, which is often too harsh on clothes anyway.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Avoid mess: </strong>Allurette is self-contained, preventing you from having to mop up any soapy spills - ideal for anyone who avoids hand washing because the clean-up takes longer than the washing process itself. The Allurette washer can also be compactly stored after use.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be organised: </strong> Using the Allurette washer means no more soaking clothes in the sink or in buckets. The Allurette washer can also be used as a laundry bag for storing your delicates pre-wash, keeping them separate from the rest of your laundry. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Extend the life of your clothes: </strong>The Allurette washer is gentle on clothes, keeping them looking clean, vibrant, and fresh, many washes in.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Save money: </strong>Longer lasting clothes means less money spent on their replacement or restoration. The Allurette washer is also electricity free and uses minimal water. As an added benefit, travellers can avoid hotel laundry fees by taking this highly portable wash bag along on their adventures. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Protect your skin: </strong>Hand washing exposes you to harsh chemicals that can, over time, dry out your skin, leaving it cracked and worn. This makes hand washing a truly problematic task, especially for those who suffer from sensitive skin or conditions such as eczema.  As clothes are rubbed from the outside of the Allurette washer, however, hands remain dry, with minimal exposure to potentially damaging liquid detergents.</p></li>
<li>
<b>Care for the environment: </b>Because the Allurette washer requires no electricity, uses minimal water, and enables grey water to be disposed of away from the water source, you can enjoy using your Allurette anywhere, confident in the knowledge that you’re respecting the environment and helping to maintain the beautiful planet that we all share.</li>
</ul>

<p>Perfect for sensitive skin and delicate garments, Allurette allows you to prolong the life of your clothes in just a few quick, simple steps. Now you can care for the clothes you love with minimal time and effort, and look exactly how you want, no cares, no concerns, no compromises.  </p>

<p><strong>What is it about the Allurette washer that makes washing easy?</strong></p>
<p>It is our combination of old washboard technology and new materials and manufacturing processes, that has enabled us to create the most efficient, electricity-free way to care for 'hand wash only' items. By rolling the effectiveness of a machine wash and the gentleness of a hand wash together in one portable, self-contained bag, we have combined the best elements from everyday laundry methods to create a new device that makes it easier than ever to care for the clothes you love. </p>
<p>The Allurette washer is lightweight (112g or &lt; 4oz.), yet incredibly durable, allowing it to be used over and over again. Key features include:</p>
<p>- the specially designed washboard for gentle and effective washing;</p>
<p>- soft waterproof nylon fabric that feels great;</p>
<p>- a simple to use roll down clip seal;</p>
<p>- an improved twist valve to easily remove air from the sealed bag;</p>
<p>- a transparent window so you can monitor the washing process;</p>
<p>- a non-slip backing to prevent the Allurette from sliding during the washing process.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487052642/fw2eoujzc3im1dntmqdo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>
<p>With the Allurette washer, you can gently care for clothes in 6 simple steps (printed at the top of the bag for easy reference). To wash clothes, simply add water and cleaning liquid, roll down the top and seal the wash bag, remove air through the valve, and rub for 30 seconds to 3 minutes. After a quick rinse, clothing is ready to dry.</p>

<h2>The Allurette gentle towel</h2>
<p>As part of our mission to provide the easiest, gentle care for the clothes you love to wear, we’ve worked to simplify not only the washing, but also the drying, process. We understand that drying clothes takes time, not to mention the frustrating challenge of safely and effectively drying items too delicate for clotheslines and coat hangers. We sought to overcome this tiresome problem and so developed the Allurette gentle towel, the easiest, safest way to ‘par-dry’ your favourite ‘hand wash only’ items.   </p>
<p>The ultra-soft Allurette gentle towel is the ideal device for ‘par-drying’ your delicates in order to expedite the drying process. Specially engineered to provide a soft, gentle environment that won’t snag or tear your clothing, it even folds down into its own portable carry-case. The Allurette gentle towel matches the Allurette washer’s sleek white colour scheme and has been designed with the same level of care in mind, making it the perfect companion for your new wash bag!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488504551/dywkurkn4zvty4k0hixj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488504521/iytbfrsapqgj6tvfpa24.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The Allurette gentle towel:</p>
<ul>
<li>Measures 64x80cm (25x31in) when unfolded, and 18x15cm (7x6in) when folded in its packaging</li>
<li>Weighs 88g (3.1oz)</li>
<li>Is suitable for most types of clothes</li>
<li>Is highly absorbent</li>
<li>Is fast-drying</li>
<li>Is made of ultra-soft microfiber</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How does it work? </strong></p>
<p>To par-dry, simply place the Allurette gentle towel on a flat surface with your wet clothes on top, then fold the towel over your garments and carefully press together. The towel’s highly absorbent microfiber material will quickly remove a large quantity of moisture from your clothes, reducing the overall amount of time required to dry them. We recommend pressing each item individually to achieve the best results.</p>
<p>The Allurette gentle towel is also a great way to dry those items that are just too delicate for clotheslines or hangers, as clothes can simply be spread to dry on top of the towel. Just remember to replace your towel if it becomes fully saturated, and to always consult the clothing care label on your garments to determine the safest and most appropriate drying method.</p>

<p><strong>Why microfiber?</strong></p>
<p>We love the high absorbency and quick-drying properties of microfiber, and especially appreciate its portability, as the fabric is highly lightweight, durable, and easily compressible, making it ideal for travel or even home storage. We have ensured that our Allurette towel is as light and portable as possible not only by using high quality microfiber, but also by scaling back the size in order to create the optimal environment for delicate, ‘hand wash only’ items. Although this smaller size makes the Allurette gentle towel inefficient for use as a bath towel, it remains the perfect tool for patting yourself dry at the pool or gym, and therefore makes a great addition to any day bag.</p>
<p>Small, portable, highly absorbent, ultra-soft, and fast-drying, the Allurette gentle towel is the perfect companion for your new Allurette washer, and makes caring for your favourite clothes easier than ever!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get </h3>
<p>Thanks to initial feedback, we are confident that our electricity-free washer, optimised for delicates and active wear, brings innovation to tired laundry routines by simplifying the way we wash 'hand wash only' garments. However, we have brought the idea to IndieGoGo to see just how many of you love it! </p>
<p>We have already completed a successful, small-scale production run, and we are exceptionally happy with the finished product. So happy, in fact, that some of these products are available for backers to snap up in our Ship Now perks.</p>
<p>We are hoping to raise $5000 from the campaign, which will go towards scaling up production. Tooling and all other components are ready to go, meaning we simply need to know how many Allurette washers to produce.  Even if we don't hit our goal, we guarantee that we will enter production to ensure all backers get their rewards. So feel free to jump on-board and give your clothes the care they deserve!</p>

<h3>Our other crowdfunded products</h3>
<p>We are 100% committed to making travel and life in general easier by developing lightweight, practical, environmentally-conscious, durable, and multi-functional products. We are also passionate about helping people live clean, light and free, as evidenced by our previous crowdfunding campaigns: </p>
<p><strong>The Scrubba wash bag (2012): </strong>Crowdfunded on Indiegogo following founder and patent attorney Ash Newland's mission to overcome the difficulty of effectively washing clothes while hiking Mt Kilimanjaro, the Scrubba wash bag ultimately raised 22,525USD of its 2,500USD goal, and has today become a pack favourite for close to 100,000 travellers across the globe. Featured in Lonely Planet, presented on Shark Tank Australia, and listed as part of Gear Junkie’s greatest gear, the world's smallest washing machine weighs only 142g (~5oz) and remains an essential item for campers, hikers, travellers and backpackers. Read more about it <a href=""https://thescrubba.com/collections/all/products/scrubba-wash-bag"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Scrubba W Pack (2015): </strong>Crowdfunded on Indiegogo, the Scrubba W pack was the outcome of Ash Newland's desire to further evolve his Scrubba wash bag vision by creating the world's most functional day pack. A backpack, wash bag and dry bag rolled into one, the W pack ultimately received 27,861USD, smashing its goal by 123%. It remains one of Scrubba's staple products and has helped innumerable hikers and travellers to see the sites and work up sweat, all while ending the day clean. See more <a href=""https://thescrubba.com/collections/all/products/scrubba-wash-pack"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Scrubba weightless wallet (2016): </strong>Crowdfunded late last year with a final pledge result of 18,385AUD, this water- and sweat-resistant travel and active wallet is 100% upcycled using excess material from the Scrubba wash bag. Weighing only 7g (~0.25oz) and featuring tear-resistant and high-frequency welded seams for maximum durability, this wallet might just be the sturdiest available in its weight class. Finishing its Kickstarter run in early October 2016, all pledges had been fulfilled and shipped by early December. The wallet is now available on the Scrubba <a href=""https://thescrubba.com/collections/all/products/the-scrubba-weightless-wallet"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a>.   </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is our fourth crowdfunding campaign and, despite hurdles along the way, we successfully completed and fulfilled our previous three within a few months of the campaigns ending. We have learned from these experiences and have great confidence that we will be able to build upon them to ship most (if not all) Allurette orders within a month of the campaign's close.</p>
<p>Because Allurette is similar to our Scrubba wash bag and Scrubba W pack, we are confident that we have sufficient experience in this area to navigate all potential issues, and therefore do not anticipate any substantial set backs or complications.  In fact, our small-scale trial production run was so successful that some of the products from this run are already available for shipping.</p>
<p>We believe in honesty and great customer service, so in the unlikely event that a delay does pop up, we will let you know and will quickly provide our strategy for getting back on track.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p><strong>How does the Allurette washer differ from the Scrubba wash bag? </strong></p>
<p>Although the Scrubba wash bag is suitable for most 'hand wash only' items, the more pronounced 'nobules' on its washboard have been engineered specifically for the tougher material of hiking, camping, and other outdoor wear. In this regard, the Scrubba wash bag is not the most suitable washing method for extremely delicate garments. The flatter, more rounded ridges that comprise Allurette's washboard, however, have been designed with the most delicate of items in mind, and therefore provide a gentler wash that is more suitable for fabrics such as lace and silk. The Allurette is also slightly smaller than the Scrubba wash bag, providing a gentle washing environment that is optimised for small laundry loads.</p>
<p><strong>What can be washed in the Allurette? </strong></p>
<p>The Allurette washer is great for most types of delicate and ‘hand wash only’ items, or indeed for any clothes that you don’t want to risk exposing to the washing machine, such as active wear, lace underwear, swimwear, and baby clothes. The Allurette washer is designed to make washing these items easy, providing an alternative to the harshness of a machine wash and to the time-consuming, messy, and skin-damaging process of hand washing.</p>
<p><strong>How much clothing can be washed in the Allurette at once? </strong></p>
<p>Generally, the Allurette is effective at cleaning a few delicate items at once, whether it be a couple of pairs of underwear, a bra and a camisole, or yoga pants and a sports bra. Although the Allurette can physically hold more clothing, the washing efficiency may be compromised if too much clothing is added.</p>
<p><strong>How big is the Allurette washer and how compactly can it be stored? </strong></p>
<p>When laid flat, the Allurette measures approximately 49 cm x 26 cm (19.3 x 10.2 inches). When conveniently rolled and clipped, the dimensions are 13 cm x 6 cm x 6 cm (5.1 x 2.4 x 2.4 inches).</p>
<p><strong>How long does a load take to wash in the Allurette washer?</strong></p>
<p>For a machine quality delicates wash, we recommend using a few drops of a specialised hand wash or delicate liquid detergent, and then gently rubbing the clothes for 2-3 minutes. For stubborn stains, the clothing may be gently rubbed for longer and/or allowed to soak in the Allurette washer prior to rubbing. Always consult the clothing care label to determine the most appropriate method of washing. If soaking clothing in the Allurette washer, ensure it is stored upright (e.g. seal facing upwards) to prevent water wicking through the seal.</p>
<p><strong>Can I use hot water in the Allurette washer?</strong></p>
<p>Due to the waterproof lining in the bag, we recommend that water no hotter than 50°C (122°F) be used. Simply put, if it is too hot for your hands, the water is too hot for the Allurette. It is important to read the care label on each clothing item carefully, as different fabrics require different water temperatures. Some fabrics need to be washed in cold water to prevent damage.</p>
<p><strong>What cleaning liquid should I use in the Allurette washer?</strong></p>
<p>We recommend the use of specialised hand wash or delicate liquid detergent. We've found the use of liquid detergents to be more efficient, as they, unlike solid detergents (powders, leaves etc.), do not require additional time to dissolve. Using a liquid also enables active suds immediately, reducing the overall time required for a wash. Mild baby shampoo (without conditioning additives that may add wax or oils) is a good choice for hand-washable silk fabrics, as it will clean the natural protein and revitalise the fibre. You can test for quantities of different cleaning products in the Allurette by checking the amount of suds visible through the clear section of the bag. If you still have suds after 30 seconds of rubbing, you can probably reduce the amount of detergent for the next load. Optimising the amount is not only better for the environment, but will also minimise the amount of rinsing required and reduce your washing costs over time. Avoid the use of detergents containing harsh chemicals, bleach, or ammonia, as these ingredients will not only damage your delicate clothing, but will reduce the Allurette’s longevity.</p>
<p><strong>Is the Allurette washer really gentle on my clothes?</strong></p>
<p>Our testing has shown that the Allurette is as effective as a washing machine and as gentle as a hand wash. If properly used, the Allurette will prolong the life of your clothes. The Allurette washer should not be used for dry clean only garments, and it is important that users always follow the washing instructions on their clothing.</p>
<p><strong>How do I dry my clothes after using the Allurette washer?</strong></p>
<p>After rinsing the clothing, gently squeeze the excess water from the garment. Do not twist or wring the item, as this may stretch the fibres and ruin the fabric. Lay your wet garment on a clean, dry towel, and pat it into shape. Roll up the towel, encasing the garment. Gently press on the rolled-up towel to encourage water absorption. Repeat with another clean, dry towel if the first one becomes saturated. Always follow the garment’s label directions for reshaping and drying. If no care label exists, lay the washed garment on a clean, dry, white towel spread over a flat surface that is moisture-resistant. Flip the garment over periodically, and replace the damp towel with a dry one as needed. Air-dry delicate lingerie on a drying rack. If the dry garment is wrinkled, check the care label for appropriate ironing temperature and, if necessary, press the garment gently to finish.

Purchase now at myallurette.com, thescrubba.com.au (for Australian orders) or thescrubba.com for shipping straight away. 
In 2012 we revolutionised travel laundry by integrating a flexible washboard into a sealable, waterproof bag. The Scrubba wash bag, an ultra portable device for washing clothes on the go, was born. Now, in response to a large number of requests for a wash bag optimised for washing delicates and active wear at home, we have designed the Allurette washer. An incredibly compact device, the Allurette features  a specially engineered washboard for delicate items, and is able to achieve a machine quality wash in just minutes.  


Who is the Allurette washer for?
The Allurette washer is for women who are seeking a better way to safely, quickly, and effectively wash their 'hand wash only' items, from lingerie to active wear. The increasing number of delicate garments in the fashion industry highlights the need for an effective washing method that, unlike even the gentlest cycle on many washing machines, cares for our clothes without exposing them to irreparable damage. 
The Allurette washer has been designed to make the hand washing process easy, fast, and mess-free. Small loads can be gently and effectively washed in just minutes. It is perfect for fashion-lovers, parents who need to wash baby clothes, active women, the environmentally-conscious, and travellers. 


The Allurette gentle washer will help you:

Save time: Small loads can be washed in the Allurette washer in just a few minutes.  No more messy soaking or waiting for the washing machine, which is often too harsh on clothes anyway.
Avoid mess: Allurette is self-contained, preventing you from having to mop up any soapy spills - ideal for anyone who avoids hand washing because the clean-up takes longer than the washing process itself. The Allurette washer can also be compactly stored after use.
Be organised:  Using the Allurette washer means no more soaking clothes in the sink or in buckets. The Allurette washer can also be used as a laundry bag for storing your delicates pre-wash, keeping them separate from the rest of your laundry. 
Extend the life of your clothes: The Allurette washer is gentle on clothes, keeping them looking clean, vibrant, and fresh, many washes in.
Save money: Longer lasting clothes means less money spent on their replacement or restoration. The Allurette washer is also electricity free and uses minimal water. As an added benefit, travellers can avoid hotel laundry fees by taking this highly portable wash bag along on their adventures. 
Protect your skin: Hand washing exposes you to harsh chemicals that can, over time, dry out your skin, leaving it cracked and worn. This makes hand washing a truly problematic task, especially for those who suffer from sensitive skin or conditions such as eczema.  As clothes are rubbed from the outside of the Allurette washer, however, hands remain dry, with minimal exposure to potentially damaging liquid detergents.

Care for the environment: Because the Allurette washer requires no electricity, uses minimal water, and enables grey water to be disposed of away from the water source, you can enjoy using your Allurette anywhere, confident in the knowledge that you’re respecting the environment and helping to maintain the beautiful planet that we all share.


Perfect for sensitive skin and delicate garments, Allurette allows you to prolong the life of your clothes in just a few quick, simple steps. Now you can care for the clothes you love with minimal time and effort, and look exactly how you want, no cares, no concerns, no compromises.  

What is it about the Allurette washer that makes washing easy?
It is our combination of old washboard technology and new materials and manufacturing processes, that has enabled us to create the most efficient, electricity-free way to care for 'hand wash only' items. By rolling the effectiveness of a machine wash and the gentleness of a hand wash together in one portable, self-contained bag, we have combined the best elements from everyday laundry methods to create a new device that makes it easier than ever to care for the clothes you love. 
The Allurette washer is lightweight (112g or < 4oz.), yet incredibly durable, allowing it to be used over and over again. Key features include:
- the specially designed washboard for gentle and effective washing;
- soft waterproof nylon fabric that feels great;
- a simple to use roll down clip seal;
- an improved twist valve to easily remove air from the sealed bag;
- a transparent window so you can monitor the washing process;
- a non-slip backing to prevent the Allurette from sliding during the washing process.

How does it work?
With the Allurette washer, you can gently care for clothes in 6 simple steps (printed at the top of the bag for easy reference). To wash clothes, simply add water and cleaning liquid, roll down the top and seal the wash bag, remove air through the valve, and rub for 30 seconds to 3 minutes. After a quick rinse, clothing is ready to dry.

What can be washed in the Allurette washer:








How do I care for specific fabrics?
The following tables are a quick reference guide for washing specific fabrics in the Allurette washer. Always consult the care instruction label on individual garments before washing.


The Allurette gentle towel
As part of our mission to provide the easiest, gentle care for the clothes you love to wear, we’ve worked to simplify not only the washing, but also the drying, process. We understand that drying clothes takes time, not to mention the frustrating challenge of safely and effectively drying items too delicate for clotheslines and coat hangers. We sought to overcome this tiresome problem and so developed the Allurette gentle towel, the easiest, safest way to ‘par-dry’ your favourite ‘hand wash only’ items.   
The ultra-soft Allurette gentle towel is the ideal device for ‘par-drying’ your delicates in order to expedite the drying process. Specially engineered to provide a soft, gentle environment that won’t snag or tear your clothing, it even folds down into its own portable carry-case. The Allurette gentle towel matches the Allurette washer’s sleek white colour scheme and has been designed with the same level of care in mind, making it the perfect companion for your new wash bag!


The Allurette gentle towel:

Measures 64x80cm (25x31in) when unfolded, and 18x15cm (7x6in) when folded in its packaging
Weighs 88g (3.1oz)
Is suitable for most types of clothes
Is highly absorbent
Is fast-drying
Is made of ultra-soft microfiber

How does it work? 
To par-dry, simply place the Allurette gentle towel on a flat surface with your wet clothes on top, then fold the towel over your garments and carefully press together. The towel’s highly absorbent microfiber material will quickly remove a large quantity of moisture from your clothes, reducing the overall amount of time required to dry them. We recommend pressing each item individually to achieve the best results.
The Allurette gentle towel is also a great way to dry those items that are just too delicate for clotheslines or hangers, as clothes can simply be spread to dry on top of the towel. Just remember to replace your towel if it becomes fully saturated, and to always consult the clothing care label on your garments to determine the safest and most appropriate drying method.


Why microfiber?
We love the high absorbency and quick-drying properties of microfiber, and especially appreciate its portability, as the fabric is highly lightweight, durable, and easily compressible, making it ideal for travel or even home storage. We have ensured that our Allurette towel is as light and portable as possible not only by using high quality microfiber, but also by scaling back the size in order to create the optimal environment for delicate, ‘hand wash only’ items. Although this smaller size makes the Allurette gentle towel inefficient for use as a bath towel, it remains the perfect tool for patting yourself dry at the pool or gym, and therefore makes a great addition to any day bag.
Small, portable, highly absorbent, ultra-soft, and fast-drying, the Allurette gentle towel is the perfect companion for your new Allurette washer, and makes caring for your favourite clothes easier than ever!

What We Need & What You Get 
Thanks to initial feedback, we are confident that our electricity-free washer, optimised for delicates and active wear, brings innovation to tired laundry routines by simplifying the way we wash 'hand wash only' garments. However, we have brought the idea to IndieGoGo to see just how many of you love it! 
We have already completed a successful, small-scale production run, and we are exceptionally happy with the finished product. So happy, in fact, that some of these products are available for backers to snap up in our Ship Now perks.
We are hoping to raise $5000 from the campaign, which will go towards scaling up production. Tooling and all other components are ready to go, meaning we simply need to know how many Allurette washers to produce.  Even if we don't hit our goal, we guarantee that we will enter production to ensure all backers get their rewards. So feel free to jump on-board and give your clothes the care they deserve!

Our other crowdfunded products
We are 100% committed to making travel and life in general easier by developing lightweight, practical, environmentally-conscious, durable, and multi-functional products. We are also passionate about helping people live clean, light and free, as evidenced by our previous crowdfunding campaigns: 
The Scrubba wash bag (2012): Crowdfunded on Indiegogo following founder and patent attorney Ash Newland's mission to overcome the difficulty of effectively washing clothes while hiking Mt Kilimanjaro, the Scrubba wash bag ultimately raised 22,525USD of its 2,500USD goal, and has today become a pack favourite for close to 100,000 travellers across the globe. Featured in Lonely Planet, presented on Shark Tank Australia, and listed as part of Gear Junkie’s greatest gear, the world's smallest washing machine weighs only 142g (~5oz) and remains an essential item for campers, hikers, travellers and backpackers. Read more about it here.
The Scrubba W Pack (2015): Crowdfunded on Indiegogo, the Scrubba W pack was the outcome of Ash Newland's desire to further evolve his Scrubba wash bag vision by creating the world's most functional day pack. A backpack, wash bag and dry bag rolled into one, the W pack ultimately received 27,861USD, smashing its goal by 123%. It remains one of Scrubba's staple products and has helped innumerable hikers and travellers to see the sites and work up sweat, all while ending the day clean. See more here.
The Scrubba weightless wallet (2016): Crowdfunded late last year with a final pledge result of 18,385AUD, this water- and sweat-resistant travel and active wallet is 100% upcycled using excess material from the Scrubba wash bag. Weighing only 7g (~0.25oz) and featuring tear-resistant and high-frequency welded seams for maximum durability, this wallet might just be the sturdiest available in its weight class. Finishing its Kickstarter run in early October 2016, all pledges had been fulfilled and shipped by early December. The wallet is now available on the Scrubba website.   

Risks & Challenges
This is our fourth crowdfunding campaign and, despite hurdles along the way, we successfully completed and fulfilled our previous three within a few months of the campaigns ending. We have learned from these experiences and have great confidence that we will be able to build upon them to ship most (if not all) Allurette orders within a month of the campaign's close.
Because Allurette is similar to our Scrubba wash bag and Scrubba W pack, we are confident that we have sufficient experience in this area to navigate all potential issues, and therefore do not anticipate any substantial set backs or complications.  In fact, our small-scale trial production run was so successful that some of the products from this run are already available for shipping.
We believe in honesty and great customer service, so in the unlikely event that a delay does pop up, we will let you know and will quickly provide our strategy for getting back on track.

FAQ
How does the Allurette washer differ from the Scrubba wash bag? 
Although the Scrubba wash bag is suitable for most 'hand wash only' items, the more pronounced 'nobules' on its washboard have been engineered specifically for the tougher material of hiking, camping, and other outdoor wear. In this regard, the Scrubba wash bag is not the most suitable washing method for extremely delicate garments. The flatter, more rounded ridges that comprise Allurette's washboard, however, have been designed with the most delicate of items in mind, and therefore provide a gentler wash that is more suitable for fabrics such as lace and silk. The Allurette is also slightly smaller than the Scrubba wash bag, providing a gentle washing environment that is optimised for small laundry loads.
What can be washed in the Allurette? 
The Allurette washer is great for most types of delicate and ‘hand wash only’ items, or indeed for any clothes that you don’t want to risk exposing to the washing machine, such as active wear, lace underwear, swimwear, and baby clothes. The Allurette washer is designed to make washing these items easy, providing an alternative to the harshness of a machine wash and to the time-consuming, messy, and skin-damaging process of hand washing.
How much clothing can be washed in the Allurette at once? 
Generally, the Allurette is effective at cleaning a few delicate items at once, whether it be a couple of pairs of underwear, a bra and a camisole, or yoga pants and a sports bra. Although the Allurette can physically hold more clothing, the washing efficiency may be compromised if too much clothing is added.
How big is the Allurette washer and how compactly can it be stored? 
When laid flat, the Allurette measures approximately 49 cm x 26 cm (19.3 x 10.2 inches). When conveniently rolled and clipped, the dimensions are 13 cm x 6 cm x 6 cm (5.1 x 2.4 x 2.4 inches).
How long does a load take to wash in the Allurette washer?
For a machine quality delicates wash, we recommend using a few drops of a specialised hand wash or delicate liquid detergent, and then gently rubbing the clothes for 2-3 minutes. For stubborn stains, the clothing may be gently rubbed for longer and/or allowed to soak in the Allurette washer prior to rubbing. Always consult the clothing care label to determine the most appropriate method of washing. If soaking clothing in the Allurette washer, ensure it is stored upright (e.g. seal facing upwards) to prevent water wicking through the seal.
Can I use hot water in the Allurette washer?
Due to the waterproof lining in the bag, we recommend that water no hotter than 50°C (122°F) be used. Simply put, if it is too hot for your hands, the water is too hot for the Allurette. It is important to read the care label on each clothing item carefully, as different fabrics require different water temperatures. Some fabrics need to be washed in cold water to prevent damage.
What cleaning liquid should I use in the Allurette washer?
We recommend the use of specialised hand wash or delicate liquid detergent. We've found the use of liquid detergents to be more efficient, as they, unlike solid detergents (powders, leaves etc.), do not require additional time to dissolve. Using a liquid also enables active suds immediately, reducing the overall time required for a wash. Mild baby shampoo (without conditioning additives that may add wax or oils) is a good choice for hand-washable silk fabrics, as it will clean the natural protein and revitalise the fibre. You can test for quantities of different cleaning products in the Allurette by checking the amount of suds visible through the clear section of the bag. If you still have suds after 30 seconds of rubbing, you can probably reduce the amount of detergent for the next load. Optimising the amount is not only better for the environment, but will also minimise the amount of rinsing required and reduce your washing costs over time. Avoid the use of detergents containing harsh chemicals, bleach, or ammonia, as these ingredients will not only damage your delicate clothing, but will reduce the Allurette’s longevity.
Is the Allurette washer really gentle on my clothes?
Our testing has shown that the Allurette is as effective as a washing machine and as gentle as a hand wash. If properly used, the Allurette will prolong the life of your clothes. The Allurette washer should not be used for dry clean only garments, and it is important that users always follow the washing instructions on their clothing.
How do I dry my clothes after using the Allurette washer?
After rinsing the clothing, gently squeeze the excess water from the garment. Do not twist or wring the item, as this may stretch the fibres and ruin the fabric. Lay your wet garment on a clean, dry towel, and pat it into shape. Roll up the towel, encasing the garment. Gently press on the rolled-up towel to encourage water absorption. Repeat with another clean, dry towel if the first one becomes saturated. Always follow the garment’s label directions for reshaping and drying. If no care label exists, lay the washed garment on a clean, dry, white towel spread over a flat surface that is moisture-resistant. Flip the garment over periodically, and replace the damp towel with a dry one as needed. Air-dry delicate lingerie on a drying rack. If the dry garment is wrinkled, check the care label for appropriate ironing temperature and, if necessary, press the garment gently to finish. If no care label exists, test in an inconspicuous area before pressing.",25.0,1,"6 Campaigns

My name is Ron Sharpe (a ""kangaroo,"" originally from Australia.) My claim-to-fame is being the Inventor
of the VALENTIMER™ - the watch  that counts
your thoughts. 
The VALENTIMER™   is a unique watch that not
only tells the time, but is designed to record the times
that you think of your SIGNIFICANT OTHER.  You can record these moments up to 30 times by just pushing the 'record' button on the right hand side of
your watch. These times can be replayed at any time by pressing the 'replay' button. 




                         WHAT IS SO SPECIAL ABOUT THE VALENTIMER™  ?
A person may tell their loved one how much they think
about them when not together,
but there has never been a way to actually demonstrate how often this occurs. The VALENTIMER™  
offers a romantic way for couples to
show just how frequently the other person crosses their mind throughout the day. 
The VALENTIMER™   memory not only retains the hours and the
minutes but also the days and the months. The memory
can be set back to zero at any time and you can start all over again thinking of your beloved!

The normal setting of your VALENTIMER™   displays the time and
date, and functions as an attractive and practical watch you can wear day and night.


                                      STYLES AND COLORS TO CHOOSE FROM
There is a female and male version of the VALENTIMER™.  The female version has a pink face and is available with a leather or metal watch band. The male version has a blue face and is also available with either a leather or metal band.






                                                                 

     Your VALENTIMER™ comes in an attractive gift box that you can personalize.   
                                                                                         
                                        WANT TO BOOST YOUR MOOD?
       A new study says you should just think about your romantic partner.In a recent study at the University of Western Ontario, researchers have
shown that simply thinking of your partner during your day can
actually put your 'blue mood' in check and energize you. 

Feeling down, stressed out and low on energy can do more harm than good to your well-being. The study suggests there is an easy way to put your blue mood in check and give your energy a nice boost --Simply think of your partner! 
New research finds that merely thinking about that special someone
activates your body chemistry in a way that improves your mood.
Sarah Stanton, a
psychology researcher at Western says, ""We set out to look at whether or
not just thinking about your partner was enough to kind of give us a physical
and psychological energy boost.""
What she found is that
when people in the study thought about their romantic partner they got a boost
in blood sugar - or glucose levels. The discovery is linked to something called
eustress - or good, euphoric stress - which is the opposite of distress, or bad
stress. And there's more good news. It wasn't just people in the early stages of romantic love who experienced the benefits. It was people in longer term relationships as well.          CTV News, London - Published August 22, 2014


We have invented the VALENTIMER™   that helps you do just that! The VALENTIMER™  counts your thoughts and records how many times you think of  your significant other. Give your energy a boost and get rid of those blue moods.
                                           
                      OTHER PRACTICAL USES FOR YOUR VALENTIMER™  


How many times have you asked yourself, “Did I take my medicine today and if so, when?”  Your VALENTIMER™   may also be used for medical purposes to
record the times of the day that you have taken your medication.  Maybe your doctor wants you to keep track of when and
how many irregular heartbeats that you have each day. Perhaps you want to record the times you catch yourself doing or saying something throughout your day. If you are pregnant, imagine being able to time how far apart your contractions are and tell your partner and doctor with accuracy. 
With your VALENTIMER™   on your wrist, all these tasks are at the tip of your fingers. I am sure that you
will find many other uses for your VALENTIMER™  once you start having fun and playing with it...that is when you are not using it to
think of your partner!          
                                                   THE PERFECT GIFT
The VALENTIMER™ is the perfect gift for anyone, at any age - for birthday's, anniversaries, weddings, pregnant women, and of course, Valentine's Day* – or any time that two people wish to show their romantic connection.                                                                                            WHICH WATCH IS RIGHT FOR YOU?
Choose the perfect style for you, and buy one for your partner too.  You can mix and match your styles in the ""Perfect Duo VALENTIMER™"" perk, or order individually.

<blockquote>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">“…Upon first listen, I’d boosted up a bass heavy track…The bass and stage formation feel very much like how I recall the Vmoda M100 to sound”.  Fast forward a few weeks and after I snagged a brief listen to a loaner M100…and what do you know?

<h3>We Have What It Takes</h3>
<p>With our team of audiophiles together with our experienced manufacturing partners, we have what it takes to make this happen. Our combined experience designing award winning audio products has resulted in numerous audio awards and industry accolades. </p>
<p>Jason manages a company called NUOEM that networks the best original equipment manufacturers (OEM's) to build and launch new audio brands for his clients and customers. OEM's are the electronics factories that design and  manufacture products for many other brands worldwide. By working with NUOEM, we are able to realize our vision; a very high standard in both sound and build quality that we demand for our customers. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">With our development partner Jason Lim and our OEM partners, we look forward to many </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">many successful product launches.</span></p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Factory Direct Products + World Class Performance</h3>
<p>Our manufacturing partners have been creating headphones for some of the worlds leading brands and they can make products to our exact specifications. The ENCORE RockMaster IE and OE headphones are an excellent example of this production capability.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436951058/akza29hh3kclt29iwndd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>Why Direct From the Factory?</b></p>
<p>The cost of most retail headphones is quite high. Consumers notice the advertisement on magazines, stylish retail store displays, events sponsorship, online promotion, and various multimedia product exposure and placement. These marketing expenses are extremely expensive and often double, triple or even quadruple the price of the product. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Then there's customized tooling for production and the necessary high volume production quantity required by the factory to run a production line and fully utilize the equipment. With factory direct products, we can remove that margin and those associated costs and offer a high quality product at an affordable price.</span></p>
<p>You pay a premium for a major brand's familiar style and quality. But there is another way we can bring exceptional products to you that represent an incredible value - factory direct products + factory direct pricing.</p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Does this business model work for everything?</b></p>
<p>Obviously not. Some products contains technologies that require many years of research and development, such as the high-performance NuPrime Audio products that Sonic Unity retails. Other products consists of exquisite design and refined material that consumers appreciate. There are large categories of products however, that can be delivered to the consumer without the huge brand premium. </p>

OEM's are the electronics factories that design and  manufacture products for many other brands worldwide. By working with NUOEM, we are able to realize our vision; a very high standard in both sound and build quality that we demand for our customers. With our development partner Jason Lim and our OEM partners, we look forward to many many successful product launches.
 

 
Factory Direct Products + World Class Performance
Our manufacturing partners have been creating headphones for some of the worlds leading brands and they can make products to our exact specifications. The ENCORE RockMaster IE and OE headphones are an excellent example of this production capability.
 
 

Why Direct From the Factory?
The cost of most retail headphones is quite high. Consumers notice the advertisement on magazines, stylish retail store displays, events sponsorship, online promotion, and various multimedia product exposure and placement. These marketing expenses are extremely expensive and often double, triple or even quadruple the price of the product. 
 
Then there's customized tooling for production and the necessary high volume production quantity required by the factory to run a production line and fully utilize the equipment. With factory direct products, we can remove that margin and those associated costs and offer a high quality product at an affordable price.
You pay a premium for a major brand's familiar style and quality. But there is another way we can bring exceptional products to you that represent an incredible value - factory direct products + factory direct pricing.
Does this business model work for everything?
Obviously not. Some products contains technologies that require many years of research and development, such as the high-performance NuPrime Audio products that Sonic Unity retails. Other products consists of exquisite design and refined material that consumers appreciate. There are large categories of products however, that can be delivered to the consumer without the huge brand premium. 
 

 


Risks & Challenges
With Jason Lim on board, we have someone with a proven track record who has delivered consistently high quality audio products, regardless of price. Jason knows the industry and can get the job done. 
 
 
 

Risks? Nothing we can't handle, so you can rest assured that your headphones will not only sound fantastic but they will be delivered without delay. We have the audio designers and the industry connections to create new, high-quality, custom OEM audio products that will really perform beyond anything else in their price range.

Ways You Can Help Make It Happen
We don't have an enormous marketing budget. If we did, the cost of these audio products would obviously be much higher! So, we need your help. Tell your friends about us. Share us on Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram, Twitter and other social media. Post on reddit and other audio forums like Head-Fi and Headphonics. Use the Indiegogo share tools to get the word out!

""The goal was to create something that would embody art, creativity and self-expression."" - Inka Olaogun, Founder/Creative Lead
 


The idea of personalization has always been the forefront, and a way to implement it was to introduce a ""signature engraving plate"" that would naturally compliment the design.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Light, but still very sturdy (without that cheap feeling in your hands), they won't leave any marks on your nose or behind the ears.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why Bamboo?</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Bamboo is one of the fastest growing plants in the world and is harvested only when the culms reach their greatest strength, and are mature. This ensures that the cultivation will have no impact on other species who rely on the Bamboo for nourishment. The Bamboo we typically use for our sunnies are Native to SouthEast Asia, and come in both natural and stained colors.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Bamboo can withstand a great deal of use without damage; in fact, it is stronger than oak, which is considered the most durable hardwood. Not only is bamboo strong and versatile, but it also possesses the renewable aspect. As wood has become more and more scarce, bamboo is being used as a renewable alternative. To produce a full-grown, hardwood tree can take up to sixty years, and then another sixty years time for a replacement. Species of bamboo equal to the height and width of a tree take as little as sixty days to mature completely. Bamboo is also easy to grow, because of its root systems, which produce several shoots at a time. Like all plants, it takes in greenhouse gasses and produces oxygen -- in fact, 35% more oxygen than an equivalent area of trees. Purchasing a pair of SEED Shades, you don't only get a fashionable trendy accessory, but also make a sustainable decision.</p>
<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">The Lenses</h1>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Premium double polarized lenses that will keep all the glare out of sight (literally!), together with lifelong bamboo frames &amp; temples adjusted to the natural head shape, applied to the frames with steel spring hinges, form the best possible eye protection in the optimal frame shape!</p>

<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">The Surfer</h1>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Surfer is  fail-safe, timeless, effortless - the only pair of shades you'll ever need. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">You can go for the slightly more elegant <b>black frame with blue reflective Revo lenses</b> for that extra hint of glam-rock and a fresh, matt bamboo look, or go with the <b>brown frame with red reflective Revo lenses</b> if you prefer the more edgy, wooden look for going out there and hitting the waves.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The SEED Surfer has slightly larger lenses than conventional wayfarer style models, helping them to stand out even more &amp; protect your eyes from glare. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">With flexible German steel spring hinges, they will fit snuggly on every face and stay in place, making them perfect for everyday wear. UVA &amp; UVB protection will serve you with the optimal eye care, while polarized lenses will elliminate any glare coming from back or front. Specially designed temples will  sit behind your ears without causing any discomfort, even after wearing the sunnies for an entire day &amp; help keep the sunglasses from moving even when doing a lot of jumping around, either at beach volley or a beach party.</p>

Here's the fun part! We have worked with over 100 fashion and lifestyle bloggers, local artists and creators to help us select the models and color combinations for the first Seed Eyewear collection.
You can initially choose between 3 different models and 2 different color variations. Don't worry, you can get all 3 models in both colors! You'll decide, which one, two, or more... you'd like to get your hands on after the campaign is over.
The Surfer
The Surfer is  fail-safe, timeless, effortless - the only pair of shades you'll ever need. 
You can go for the slightly more elegant black frame with blue reflective Revo lenses for that extra hint of glam-rock and a fresh, matt bamboo look, or go with the brown frame with red reflective Revo lenses if you prefer the more edgy, wooden look for going out there and hitting the waves.
The SEED Surfer has slightly larger lenses than conventional wayfarer style models, helping them to stand out even more & protect your eyes from glare. 
With flexible German steel spring hinges, they will fit snuggly on every face and stay in place, making them perfect for everyday wear. UVA & UVB protection will serve you with the optimal eye care, while polarized lenses will elliminate any glare coming from back or front. Specially designed temples will  sit behind your ears without causing any discomfort, even after wearing the sunnies for an entire day & help keep the sunglasses from moving even when doing a lot of jumping around, either at beach volley or a beach party.
The Jetsetter
With the Jetsetter you are getting a tear-drop shaped, slightly larger than average police model, high-quality, high-fashion and high-endurance sunglasses, made entirely of bamboo. Extremely light to wear, but firm and very durable, they will fit your nose during your travels, your sport activities, your fancying around over morning coffee or afternoon cocktails.
You can go for the darker Galaxy option, with black stained bamboo frame and blue/purple reflective Revo lenses, or the lighter Sunset, with brown stained bamboo frame with more visible wooden grain and red/yellow reflective lenses.
With flexible German steel spring hinges, they will fit snuggly on every face and stay in place, making them perfect for everyday wear. UVA & UVB protection will serve you with the optimal eye care, while polarized lenses will elliminate any glare coming from back or front. With an eye catching design and comfortable feel, these are bound to become THE pair of sunglasses that you have to have with you at all times, so... don't say we didn't warn you! ;)
The Hipster
Round Keyhole models are trending. If Wayfarers are eternal, these are of the moment. You won't pass unobserved with them - and thats cool!
With SEED Hipster you can go for the Black stained frames with dark grey gradient lenses - Mr. Holmes meets high-street  fashion, a top-shelf look for your adventurous soul, or for Brown stained frames with warm brown/beige lenses to go for a bit softer, but still funky look and add that extra something to all your outfits.
With flexible German steel spring hinges, they will fit snuggly on every face and stay in place, making them perfect for everyday wear. UVA & UVB protection will serve you with the optimal eye care, while polarized lenses will elliminate any glare coming from back or front. Specially designed temples will  sit behind your ears without causing any discomfort, even after wearing the sunnies for an entire day & help keep the sunglasses in place, even after an entire day of busy shopping and sightseeing in your favorite metropolis.
But to make all this happen, we need your help. We need a 100 of you that believe in sustainable fashion and are willing to support this project -this will allow us to begin the first production run of Seed sunglasses. Here's how you can support our campaign and be the first to get a pair of the freshest wooden sunglasses around!
1) Select a 
perk on the right hand side to start your pre-order. You can select 
either one pair or two pairs of Seed sunglasses at an early bird price as well as a few higher end perks.2) Continue onto the next page to enter shipping information followed by payment details. Note;

<h3>Limited editions with a unique story, that don't compromise in quality or comfort.</h3>
<p>Our brand was born one year ago as an attempt to help others remember their creativity. We were feeling trapped in our own routines and feared that we were forgetting our former authentic selves. That's why we decided to create unique shoes that would <span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>give you back your freedom to be your own self and live your own style. </span></p>
<p>Having brought already our first <a href=""https://www.liebrestyle.com/shop/men/paisley-yellow-india/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Derby Shoe Collection</strong></a> to our customers around the world, we are ready now to continue creating unique shoe collections. Here in Indiegogo, we are offering our next <strong>Chelsea Boot Collection</strong> to pre-order. With your support we will go back to the family owned business in Portugal helping us to make this collection a reality.</p>
<h3>Versatile</h3>
<p><strong>Chelsea Boots</strong> are really <strong>versatile</strong> and can be combined with almost anything in your wardrobe. They will always give a special notch to your outfit. For instance, take a lay back outfit with jeans, and combine it with the Timber Accra model to <strong>dress up</strong> your look. Or try the opposite and <strong>dress down</strong> your official office outfit by combining these boots with dress pants.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530213627/ehqlz5bptl1lxfguulxa.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Unisex</h3>
<p>This new Chelsea Boot Collection is <strong>unisex</strong> and is available in any size ranging from the 36 (US 5) to 45 (US 11.5). The female sizes will use a female width giving a narrower look. See the sizing section below for more information.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529955925/jbedyzg8yjhahk9e4tds.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Limited Editions</h3>
<p>Only <strong>small batches </strong>of 30 pairs or less are created of each design. This is due to the small amount of textiles that we have personally collected during our trips around the world. Also because we believe in uniqueness instead of mass-produced products. Our <strong>limited editions</strong> support our vision of creating a world where people feel free to stand out from the crowd.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530560229/t5hgqpattfh3auql88sb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Textiles</h3>
<p>The way we collect textiles is done with love, respect and without haste. Our textiles come from <strong>local markets and artisans</strong> discovered in our travels <strong>around the world</strong>. Only small quantities of textiles are collected so that they can fit in our small travel backpacks - enough to make a unique shoe batch of about 30 pairs, sometimes less. Read below to learn more about each of the specific textiles features in our <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">new</span><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> Chelsea Boot Collection: </span></p>
<p><strong>African Wax Print (Ghana): </strong>The process to make African Wax prints is inspired by the Indonesian method of dyeing cloth by using wax. Africans use the fabrics as a method of communication, with certain patterns having widely understood meanings. This type of textile is featured in the <strong><i>Sunset Accra </i></strong>and<strong><i> Timber Accra</i></strong> boots. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530218265/vvf2floiunp2hsurb7tg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p><strong>Hand Woven Indigo (Thailand): </strong>This hand woven cotton is dyed with plant-based indigo, which creates a deep and rich blue. The waste water from the dying process is biodegradable. In addition to using natural dyes, the Thai weavers utilize locally picked cotton, which is less refined (not bleached) than mass-produced cotton. This type of textile is featured in the <i><strong>Mangkhud Bangkok</strong></i> boot.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530218425/vrtkdtdfrgh2pndpg0nn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Batik Print (Indonesia): </strong> Batik is the traditional textile of Indonesia and it was designated by the UNESCO as Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. Locally produced batik prints are commonly used in normal life and help improve the local economy. This type of textile is featured in the  <strong><i>Javakafe Jakarta</i></strong> boot.</p>

<p><strong>Silk Brocade (Shanghai):</strong> Interestingly, silk was first discovered in China, where it was kept in secret for centuries, and today it is China who still holds the repute of producing one of the world’s finest quality silk fabrics. This soft white satin in a silk brocade is featured in the <strong><i>Midnight Shanghai</i></strong> design. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530218451/iapejn4koyowxy7jpzay.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Khokhloma Print (Russia): </strong>The <strong><i>Forest Moscow</i></strong>  boot features a cotton print decorated in the well-known khokhloma style, a Russian folk art first used in the 17th century to decorate tableware. The style includes a rich floral motif where the golden or yellow flowers symbolize a happy life and are believed to bring light and wealth.</p>

<h3>Leather</h3>
<p>Our boot collection is made of high-quality and durable leathers from tanneries in Italy or Portugal. In this collection you can chose between a <strong>soft suede</strong> (see Forest Moscow, Sunset Accra, Timber Accra, Midnight Shanghai or Mangkhud Bangkok) or a <strong>vegetable-tanned leather</strong> (see Javakafe Jakarta). All boots have a cow-leather lining.</p>
<h3>Crafting</h3>
<p>All Liebre Style shoes are <strong>handcrafted in Portuga</strong>l by a small team of experienced artisans. It is not easy to find the right artisans that will agree to focus on quality and uniqueness, rather than quantities. Luckily for us, our artisans in Portugal believe in our vision to make the world more diverse. Our prototypes have been finished and successfully tested. Thanks to your help we can now go back to the family businesses in Portugal helping us with this collection so that they can start handcrafting our boots and belts.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530204872/ia68wl01nhftnzronr8s.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Belts</h3>
<p>In the social media feedback it was important for you to have <strong>matching belts</strong> and for this new collection we will be designing them. We have found a small family-owned atelier in Portugal specialized in <strong>handcrafting leather belts</strong>. Each of our boots will have a matching belt featuring the same leather color and type of the boot design. At the moment, we are in the prototyping phase and we will be sharing detailed pictures with you very soon. </p>

<h3>Add a Boot/Belt</h3>
<p>If you have already ordered your favorite shoe design, you may want to add a second shoe pair or a matching belt to your order. We will send you a survey after your pledge to get your requested boot design and size, and/or your requested belt design.</p>

</div></div>","Limited editions with a unique story, that don't compromise in quality or comfort.
Our brand was born one year ago as an attempt to help others remember their creativity. We were feeling trapped in our own routines and feared that we were forgetting our former authentic selves. That's why we decided to create unique shoes that would give you back your freedom to be your own self and live your own style. 
Having brought already our first Derby Shoe Collection to our customers around the world, we are ready now to continue creating unique shoe collections. Here in Indiegogo, we are offering our next Chelsea Boot Collection to pre-order. With your support we will go back to the family owned business in Portugal helping us to make this collection a reality.
Versatile
Chelsea Boots are really versatile and can be combined with almost anything in your wardrobe. They will always give a special notch to your outfit. For instance, take a lay back outfit with jeans, and combine it with the Timber Accra model to dress up your look. Or try the opposite and dress down your official office outfit by combining these boots with dress pants.

Unisex
This new Chelsea Boot Collection is unisex and is available in any size ranging from the 36 (US 5) to 45 (US 11.5). The female sizes will use a female width giving a narrower look. See the sizing section below for more information.

Limited Editions
Only small batches of 30 pairs or less are created of each design. This is due to the small amount of textiles that we have personally collected during our trips around the world. Also because we believe in uniqueness instead of mass-produced products. Our limited editions support our vision of creating a world where people feel free to stand out from the crowd.

Textiles
The way we collect textiles is done with love, respect and without haste. Our textiles come from local markets and artisans discovered in our travels around the world. Only small quantities of textiles are collected so that they can fit in our small travel backpacks - enough to make a unique shoe batch of about 30 pairs, sometimes less. Read below to learn more about each of the specific textiles features in our new Chelsea Boot Collection: 
African Wax Print (Ghana): The process to make African Wax prints is inspired by the Indonesian method of dyeing cloth by using wax. Africans use the fabrics as a method of communication, with certain patterns having widely understood meanings. This type of textile is featured in the Sunset Accra and Timber Accra boots. 


Hand Woven Indigo (Thailand): This hand woven cotton is dyed with plant-based indigo, which creates a deep and rich blue. The waste water from the dying process is biodegradable. In addition to using natural dyes, the Thai weavers utilize locally picked cotton, which is less refined (not bleached) than mass-produced cotton. This type of textile is featured in the Mangkhud Bangkok boot.

Batik Print (Indonesia):  Batik is the traditional textile of Indonesia and it was designated by the UNESCO as Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. Locally produced batik prints are commonly used in normal life and help improve the local economy. This type of textile is featured in the  Javakafe Jakarta boot.

Silk Brocade (Shanghai): Interestingly, silk was first discovered in China, where it was kept in secret for centuries, and today it is China who still holds the repute of producing one of the world’s finest quality silk fabrics. This soft white satin in a silk brocade is featured in the Midnight Shanghai design. 

Khokhloma Print (Russia): The Forest Moscow  boot features a cotton print decorated in the well-known khokhloma style, a Russian folk art first used in the 17th century to decorate tableware. The style includes a rich floral motif where the golden or yellow flowers symbolize a happy life and are believed to bring light and wealth.

Leather
Our boot collection is made of high-quality and durable leathers from tanneries in Italy or Portugal. In this collection you can chose between a soft suede (see Forest Moscow, Sunset Accra, Timber Accra, Midnight Shanghai or Mangkhud Bangkok) or a vegetable-tanned leather (see Javakafe Jakarta). All boots have a cow-leather lining.
Crafting
All Liebre Style shoes are handcrafted in Portugal by a small team of experienced artisans. It is not easy to find the right artisans that will agree to focus on quality and uniqueness, rather than quantities. Luckily for us, our artisans in Portugal believe in our vision to make the world more diverse. Our prototypes have been finished and successfully tested. Thanks to your help we can now go back to the family businesses in Portugal helping us with this collection so that they can start handcrafting our boots and belts.

Belts
In the social media feedback it was important for you to have matching belts and for this new collection we will be designing them. We have found a small family-owned atelier in Portugal specialized in handcrafting leather belts. Each of our boots will have a matching belt featuring the same leather color and type of the boot design. At the moment, we are in the prototyping phase and we will be sharing detailed pictures with you very soon. 

Add a Boot/Belt
If you have already ordered your favorite shoe design, you may want to add a second shoe pair or a matching belt to your order. We will send you a survey after your pledge to get your requested boot design and size, and/or your requested belt design.

Who We Are
 
Sizing
All boots are available in sizes ranging from the US 5 (EU 36) to the US 12 (EU 46). Orders for sizes outside of this range are unfortunately not available due to the unavailability of cutting knives. We will send you a survey after your pledge to get your requested size. If you are not sure about your shoe size, you can find some help in this link.

<p>I was born 8 months ago. Mother bore me naturally, although they say that French bulldogs are mostly born via c-section. That told me I was special right away. I saw the world in 10 days, walked in 22 days and started exploring the room we were living in. Mom, Aunt, the 4 of us. There was a guy called Milos who took care of all of us. Mom and Auntie were going out and came back from time to time. We, little kids, were eating, drinking, biting all we could find, peeing, pooping, sleeping, and round and round. One day, brothers started leaving the room, not coming back. I started suspecting that this was going to happen to me to. I was worried, because I haven’t had a clue what was out there and whether I would like it. I was cozy here, feeling just fine. As it happened it turned out I was right.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Nancy</h3>
<p>6 months ago Nancy saw my photos online and called Milos. She was interested in me. I didn’t know who Nancy was nor what it meant to be interested in someone. He kept taking photos of me and sending to her every day, and she answered in some heart signs. Later on, when I grew up a bit, I realized that all women were sending hearts when they saw little adorable babies. And I was that adorable one. Taking photos, corresponding, texting hearts and next thing I knew, I was on my way to Belgrade. That day was my first car ride, my first going out of the room and the town I had been born in, and the first time I saw Nancy. She bought me a bed, toys, food, little dining dishes and a blanket. It was so obvious that I was here to stay. I liked Nancy and I liked her apartment. And to be honest, after only an hour spent with her, it was so clear that I would be a royal here. I told Milos: “Its ok. You can go. I’ll stay here definitely.”</p>

<p>Nancy and I, we have plans working together. We are planning to set up a local business for all the Nixons in the world.

For the white, with the way they are designed, our only option was to go longer, so we did.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494474865/chbgth2kgs2yerdx2kak.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494474890/z7hzxqpd5cjwdu3xvjvc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/210612868?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div><div>

The Tran-Siberian railroad pocket watch; now more than a decade out of production. </p>
<p>In the spirit of these famed timepieces and the trans Siberian railroad, Pramzius -- our new brand based in the USA -- is bringing back the Trans-Siberian railroad watch, but this time for the wrist. Pramzius, named for the mythological Baltic Ruler of Time, seeks inspirations from Eastern Europe and the Baltic region to reignite a world of often forgotten horology and great historic timepieces with new looks and top-flight engines.</p>
<p>By backing our project, not only will you get an amazingly cool timepiece (depending on your level of support) but you will be helping a small, family-run company to realize our dreams of owning our own watch brand. We promise we won't let you down with this or any of the future models we are already developing. Our goal is to make every Pramzius watch an event and something unique on the wrist.</p>

There are actually several types of watch crystals that provide different kinds of protection for your watch </p><p>For the purposes of the Trans-Siberian, we are only concerned with the K1 mineral crystal and the sapphire.

The K1 is a 7 and sapphire is a 9.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494474307/g6or3gz7azkaktai3zbd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The K1 is a special manufacturing process that gives the crystal more scratch resistance than regular mineral and more shatter resistance than sapphire. They are excellent crystals for sport watches, which the Trans-Siberian really isn't, even though it is 10 ATM water resistant. But we wanted the base model to be under $300 and the only way to do that was with a K1.</p><p>Why does sapphire cost more? The main reason is it is the hardest crystal material you can get and therefore the most scratch resistant. It's nearly impossible to scratch a sapphire crystal. It is also about the way they are produced versus mineral, but we won't get into that much technical detail here. Bottom line: The K1 will serve you just fine on the Trans-Siberian but if you want the ultimate protection from scratches, the sapphire is worth the upgrade.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494474381/asoyinprpqbhz1pmutjs.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>You may also be wondering: This watch is 48 mm and it has the extended lugs and crown of a pocket watch configuration, is it actually comfortable on the wrist? </p><p>First we would refer you back to the testimonial video up top where Marton Radkai, the editor of Wristwatch Annual, test drove the watch for a day and said it was not only comfortable on the wrist, but VERY comfortable on the wrist.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494475195/zmhplaurv9oethaewrbh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Second we share that is why we made three strap options.

During the past two decades, our company has imported watches into North America as the exclusive distributors of brands like Vostok-Europe, Aviator and Sturmanskie (the first watch in space on the wrist of Yuri Gagarin).Our main focus has been watches from Eastern Europe and Russia, thus the choice of our name and area of focus for inspirations. We have thousands of satisfied customers around the globe and we have many resellers of our watches in the US, Canada and the Caribbean. You can check us out on Facebook not only for Pramzius but Russia2all is one of our other pages where we have nearly 50k followers.Throughout our years in business, we have been involved in ALL aspects of the watch business, including design, development, distribution, servicing, marketing, you name it. While this is our first brand we have launched by ourselves, you can pledge with confidence knowing a company with a solid history is behind your Pramzius watch.You can also find out more at Pramzius.comYou spoke and we listened! The single most common piece of feedback was that the hands on the watch are too small. We went back to the drawing board and have designed new hands. For the black and blue models they will be both thicker and longer (so more lume!). For the white, with the way they are designed, our only option was to go longer, so we did.

All our Pramzius watches will use inspirations from one of the eight countries that border the Baltic Sea.

We chose this name to be true to our roots, while providing us with a wider geography from which to draw our inspirations.

We designed the Trans-Siberian collection as a wrist watch tied to the world of the pocket watch that marries antiquity and modernity like nothing else you have ever put on your wrist.Our first edition is inspired by a Trans-Siberian Russian railroad pocket watch popular in decades past built by a company that sadly ceased operation in 2007. The original watch maintained popularity throughout its run, because, well, it was just plain cool. The simple dial and that amazing relief image of the train on the back made the watch a must have for collectors of Russian timepieces as well as devotees to pocket watches.We sold this watch in North America for many years before the company folded, and it was a personal favorite of Co-Founder Craig Hester (he has several in his private collection). We have always wanted to bring this watch back to life ever since the last one left the assembly floor.Even with our love of the original, we made sure the Trans-Siberian incorporates critical updates from the inspiration that today's watch consumer demands. The case, crystal and crown, among other things, are all significantly improved. The original was plated brass, and the Pramzius is all surgical-grade stainless steel. The acrylic crystal on the inspiration is upgraded to a K1 mineral (or optional sapphire). And, of course, the inspiration wasn't designed for the wrist and didn't have an optional desk stand.We like to say the Trans-Siberian ""is unapologetically big"" at 48 mm. We just had to have it sized similarly to the inspiration and we wanted it to be usable alternatively as a clock on the cherry wood veneer stand that comes with Tier 3. A local artisan friend of ours produces these right here in Connecticut.Instead of a pocket watch movement with a sub-dial second hand, we chose the NH38 open-heart movement built by SII of Japan, with the open heart displayed where the sub seconds would normally appear. This gives your watch a visually engaging look while maintaining a pocket watch feel and holding true to the inspiration's legacy.This is a 24-jewel movement of the highest caliber of construction. We have years of experience with Seiko movements and know they are among the best-made in the world. This caliber winds automatically with the movement of your wrist, so it never needs a battery and if worn daily, you won't need to wind it. The movement can be manually wound and it ""hacks"", which means the second hand will stop when the crown is pulled out.For us, the case back was the most critical feature to be lifted directly from the inspiration. It's what made the original such a stand-out timepiece. So our case back features the large, 3D relief of the original train that appeared on the inspiration watch down to even the smallest detail. All three models are numbered, limited editions of no more than 999 pieces per dial. We like rarity.Even though this is not a dive watch, we also insisted on 10 ATM water resistance. We simply aren't satisfied with 3 or 5 ATM. What does this mean? We won't go into all the aspects of water resistance in watches here. But 10 ATM can handle most any water situation short of serious diving.

<p><span style="""">Hello and thank you for taking the time to read over and ponder our request for your help in this campaign. My name is Jeff Burkholder and I am a current Active Duty Military Chief Warrant Officer 2. I’ve been in the Armed Services for over 11 years now with time served in the Marines, Army National Guard and now the Active Duty Army.</span></p>
<p><span style="""">This campaign to me is not just very important but very personal in nature. I was almost hit and could have been very possibly killed a short while ago. No, not while in the sands of Iraq or Afghanistan, but here in our great nation while trying to do the very basic of things, help others cross the street.</span></p>
<p><span style="""">This campaign is important to us because not only it will allow us the opportunity to produce more jobs for hard working AMERICANS and fellow Veterans, but because it encompasses the chance to help save someone’s life and possibly even your very own or someone you love or know one day when you or they least expected it.</span></p>
<p><span style="""">Have you ever found yourself driving down the road just bebopping along then all of a sudden out of the blue you come across someone you didn’t see in, out or alongside of the road?

</div></div>","Short Summary
Hello and thank you for taking the time to read over and ponder our request for your help in this campaign. My name is Jeff Burkholder and I am a current Active Duty Military Chief Warrant Officer 2. I’ve been in the Armed Services for over 11 years now with time served in the Marines, Army National Guard and now the Active Duty Army.
This campaign to me is not just very important but very personal in nature. I was almost hit and could have been very possibly killed a short while ago. No, not while in the sands of Iraq or Afghanistan, but here in our great nation while trying to do the very basic of things, help others cross the street.
This campaign is important to us because not only it will allow us the opportunity to produce more jobs for hard working AMERICANS and fellow Veterans, but because it encompasses the chance to help save someone’s life and possibly even your very own or someone you love or know one day when you or they least expected it.
Have you ever found yourself driving down the road just bebopping along then all of a sudden out of the blue you come across someone you didn’t see in, out or alongside of the road? Then you find yourself looking in the review mirror scared to death wondering where in the world did that person just come from?
I have, all too often I have found myself in that situation, where someone is running, walking or biking in, out and along the roadway with dark clothing on. They may or may not have been wearing a piece of reflective clothing but they were not visible until my headlights illuminated them or I was passing them and it was in my opinion to close for comfort should they have fallen or decide to dart in the other direction at the last minute.
So I embarked upon a journey to try and locate a safety vest that would do just what I had envisioned. But too much of my disappointment, I was not able to discover ANY safety vest that could do what it said neither in any environment nor to the distance that would be noticeable to drivers allowing us the reaction time we needed to avoid the person or hazard.
I set out to invent an LED Safety Vest that would change the standards for not just safety vests in general but LED safety vests forever. I wanted a vest that would do as it was intended for-SAVEING LIVES and not just be another thing that we are told to wear or that we purchase in the hope that it might work as designed or advertised one day.
High visibility non-reflective clothing (bright color’s) offer limited safety to the person wearing them, and offers a way to be seen while working, walking, running, or riding bikes in and along the roadways during the day time. This type of personal protection equipment can be seen from a short distance but it’s limited to just that, a short distance and the attention of drivers.
Bright high visibility reflective clothing is also only as good as the weather and light surrounding it, thus paving the way for the need for more and more reflective types of clothing i.e. reflective safety vests, straps & bands that offer the chance to be seen at a greater distance.
To be seen or not to be seen: almost all safety vests and reflective attire require some sort of headlight or lighted source to be illuminated upon them in order to be seen or function as they are intended even during the daytime.
There is a very high need for a safety vest that can give drivers an added ambient light or better said; “Visual Cue” farther in advance and still is able to perform in all types of day, night and inclement weather conditions. How many of us like to see there is going to be a traffic signal ahead before we get there?
That is why I have designed a vest that will do the very thing that it is designed for- SAVE LIFES and Alert Drivers. This isn’t just another Safety Vest; it is setting a NEW STANDARD for the Safety Community. This vest is versatile and meant to be used by EVERYONE. Road workers, bikers, walkers, runners, joggers, Police Officers, Firefighters, EMS workers, tow truck driver etc. etc.
By supporting this campaign you will help us to get this product out to the mainstream market not for making of a quick buck, but for offering a product that REALLY WORKS and you can depend on.
What We Are Asking You’re Help For
We are asking for your help to raise $250,000 for the purchase of all the materials we will need to get this Patent Pending LED Safety Vest to the mass market. It will pay for all the cost for initial production equipment, supplies and materials, hiring of AMERICAN and Veteran workers, store placement, shipping & packaging equipment and so forth.
The Impact
You are helping another AMERICAN and or VETERAN out there with getting that job they may have really needed.
You will have contributed to the production of a QUALITY AMERICAN MADE Product and not another garbage foreign made product that have flooded our stores.
You can stand reassured that you are supporting the values of Honor and Integrity with the production of this Safety Vest and that it actually does what it was designed to do, Alert Drivers and SAVE-LIVES.
Other Ways You Can Help
Some of you just can’t contribute, and we totally understand that but could you help us get the word out?
If you can help us get the word out and make some noise about our campaign we would be forever in your debt. If we could reach 250,000 people whom all could give just $1 we would make our goal.

Four years working towards one short walk down a runway. It doesn’t sound like much but it’s the single most important moment of my career to date and one that will hugely influence the rest of my working life. On February 15, 2014 my senior line will feature in the University of Minnesota, Apparel Design Fashion Show; four looks meticulously created to form the main body of my undergraduate work. Planning and funding of the show will be coordinated by myself and fellow students and all materials are at our own expense. This page has been launched to humbly ask for support in achieving a hard fought ambition.</p><p>Fashion can be a superficial world and after a number of unpaid internships doing various menial tasks for little appreciation I have questioned more than a few times whether it is a world I really want to be a part of. But it’s not the glitz and ostentation that interests me, it’s what happens behind the scenes to inspire complex designs, source unusual fabrics, and create something that is ultimately a work of art. To achieve this is anything but superficial but requires a great deal of determination, self-belief and a total sacrifice of any social life.</p><p>In my work I often play with the idea of hard and soft. I am exploring the concept of confinement; garments that constrict natural movement and tread a fine line between wearability and art form. My designs are avant garde yet retain a beautiful simplicity. They are not eccentric for the sake of provocation. For my senior line I have painstakingly created my own digital designs which will be printed using state of the art fabric plotting technology. Combining strong structural forms with organic prints I have intentionally held back from designing an overly conceptual composition in order to balance the attention of both the silhouette and the prints.</p><p>Although I’m still an undergraduate I have strived to get exposure in a number of fashion design businesses. It has given me an insight into the real fashion world and has also given me an appreciation of professionalism. It is my goal to create credible and high-end pieces that not only stand out in a degree show but can ultimately stand up against runway pieces by the world’s top designers. Your contribution will truly help me reach the level I’m aiming for.</p><br/><h3>Where will your contribution go?</h3><p>There are so many elements involved in creating each piece, from multiple test garments to styling the final look. The bulk of the funding will go towards designing my own fabric. Digital fabric printing is cutting edge technology and is still relatively expensive to access. Although it is costly to use I’m fortunate that the University of Minnesota has a fabric plotter available so I can control the process from start to finish. This large printer will allow me to create the pattern in the desired yardage amount.</p><p>My sponsorship goal is $800 with the breakdown of costs:</p><ul>
<li><p>Digitally printing my designs onto fabric: $350 </p></li>
<li><p>Interior structure (interfacing, horsehair canvas, lining etc): $250</p></li>

Its natural and sustainable, and I love that leather smell and so decided to finally make a real nice one to share with you guys. Its taken about 2 years to source the right high quality leather and craftsmanship and about 8 months to refine and create the samples. It’s handmade from super tough kangaroo leather which is thinner than cow leather and far stronger than any other leather in the world.</span><br/><br/><span style=""font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"">Kangaroo Leather? </span><span style=""font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"">Kangaroo leather is the toughest leather. Its very thin, durable and light and yet has a higher tensile strength than any other leather. Even when its cut thinner it still keeps most of its strength. This is because the hide contains virtually no fat due to the Australian environment which can cause holes and weakness when tanning.</span><br/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.pozible.com/uploads/03-2013/1364391436.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><span style=""font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;""><span id=""internal-source-marker_0.14304099372823398"" style=""font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"">I really hate those massive wallets that can hurt your back or bulge out from your pants </span>that many people endure with. The Bantam Wallet is not like those small plastic and metal RFID wallets that severely limit what you can put in them and a lot tougher than the wallets that are just 2 pieces of material with an expensive rubber band around it. Most importantly, you won't be embarrassed carrying the Bantam Wallet around as it looks stylish with jeans or a suit!<br/></span></p>

Have you ever wanted a small, thin, premium wallet that looks good, functions well and stops credit and identity theft?
                             BANTAM WALLET
The thinnest premium leather customizable RFID blocking wallet.
                              Stop skimmers, scammers and scumbags!
Hi my name is James and I want to show you a wallet I’ve been playing with for a while now. I’ve been using this design for over 11 years and every time someone buys me a wallet, or I think another one looks good, I’ve always come back to this design. It just works!I love leather. Its natural and sustainable, and I love that leather smell and so decided to finally make a real nice one to share with you guys. Its taken about 2 years to source the right high quality leather and craftsmanship and about 8 months to refine and create the samples. It’s handmade from super tough kangaroo leather which is thinner than cow leather and far stronger than any other leather in the world.Kangaroo Leather? Kangaroo leather is the toughest leather. Its very thin, durable and light and yet has a higher tensile strength than any other leather. Even when its cut thinner it still keeps most of its strength. This is because the hide contains virtually no fat due to the Australian environment which can cause holes and weakness when tanning.I really hate those massive wallets that can hurt your back or bulge out from your pants that many people endure with. The Bantam Wallet is not like those small plastic and metal RFID wallets that severely limit what you can put in them and a lot tougher than the wallets that are just 2 pieces of material with an expensive rubber band around it. Most importantly, you won't be embarrassed carrying the Bantam Wallet around as it looks stylish with jeans or a suit!
The Bantam Wallet is super thin at 4mm (about 5/32inches) and still allows for a number of cards and cash to be carried. You CAN stuff a lot of cards, cash, dockets, post-it-notes, whatever you want in there if you really want to, even coins and keys! I’ve only needed about 7 cards and some cash at any time and I store all those dozens of other cards at home that I use only once-in-a-blue-moon.
_______________________________________________________________________
8 Reasons to Support the Bantam Wallet Project:
1 - Its super thin, durable, light and perfect for any sized front, back or inside pocket.
2 - Its made of very high quality leather.
3 - You don’t have to pull it apart and put it together every time you want to use it, or have the risk of it falling apart accidently or from use over time.
4 - It doesn’t expose any cards to prying eyes, even when you open it.
5 - Your cards and cash can’t accidentally slip out.
6 - The contents wont fall out if you drop it.
7 - It has RFID blocking to stop someone skimming your cards and stealing your credit card money, or worse, your identity!
8 - You can customize the RFID feature by blocking the whole wallet, half of it, or none!
_______________________________________________________________________ 
 
Choose from 2 different styles of leather or suede.

Each wallet includes 2x RFID blocking cards.
 
RFID blocking? Increasingly in today's techy world, credit cards, drivers license cards, ID cards, and many other cards have an RFID chip. Radio Frequency Identification allows the transfer of information through electromagnetic induction at very short distances with no wires. We’re ready to go!Design - At this stage we have the final design which minimises wastage of the leather hide. It also allows for quick production as well.Leather - The leather we use is ethical, sustainable and government approved and is of a very high quality.Workshop - We have 2 skilled workshops ready for production and have been making similar items for over 25 years combined and are eager to help us out!Funds - The money raised will go into buying materials such as the leather, thread, tools, and paying the leather crafters.I hope you like the Bantam Wallet. Please click on a perk of your choice on the side and if you have any questions just let us know.Thanks!James

<p>  Hello Indiegogo Family,</p>
<p>I thought I would start by telling you where we came from. In 2006, I began to think about how I could create a meaningful, lasting American company that would compete in the world market, while supporting artisans and manufacturing here at home. After seeing the rise of popular food culture with such things as The Food Network, I realized that there was a gaping whole in the market for a lifestyle brand that suited the modern foodie as well as the professional chef. I was a chef myself, so I knew there was a demand for products that centered around the culinary lifestyle. I also knew, after years of working with local artisans from a chef's perspective, that there was a way to build such a company using American craftsmen as well as a few select small producers around the world that were making a difference in their communities. </p>
<p>This year, after teaming up with an amazing graphic artist (James Porter), we brought that vision to life by creating our first t-shirt that paid tribute to Heritage ingredients. Eventually, we progressed into making prototypes for other items that make up the culinary lifestyle, including chef knives, cutting boards, aprons, soaps with culinary ingredients, and more. This Fall, we're ready to produce the full and complete line of Butcher &amp; Baker products, manufactured <strong>completely</strong> by small manufacturers in socially responsible ways. All of our items will be either sustainable, organic, upcycled, recycled, and supportive of artisans and small-producers.</p>
<p><strong>Together, James and I have spent the last year seeking out people that could take our designs from prototype to production - people that embraced our philosophies. We found them, and we're ready. Now, Butcher &amp; Baker has an opportunity to make a difference in the economy , and spark a revolution in American manufacturing. </strong></p>
<p>We have developed relationships with small operations that have the ability to scale up as we go. We want to make sure our partners have a real opportunity for growth over a sustained period of time. As we move to produce the Fall Line, increased demand will create more work for them, and will greatly increase the positive impact on their local communities. Even with the small amount we have done, we have immediately noticed an excitement level that doesn't come from large operations. With tens of millions of people in the U.S. identifying themselves as food and cooking enthusiasts, and even more around the world, we know we can build a viable American company with a real purpose. </p>
<p>We’ve worked through all of the logistics of proving that this will work. We've built the site and we're ready to go. Here's where your pledges will go. </p>

<h2>HACKABLE: ROAD AND FILM TESTED ENGINEERING</h2>
<p>After Brent finished 77 helmets with Ironhead Studios for TRON: LEGACY we began to talk about taking the basic technology inside and putting it on everyday bike and cycle helmets. Our first prototype was worn by Evo for over 200 hours (over 100 hours on 1 9V battery!) and made it through a daytime car accident without getting destroyed. We found that we preferred the waterproof LEDs seen on the back of our first prototype helmet - they can be seen for TWO CITY BLOCKS when biking at night!</p>

We provide a basic hat (fascinator or fedora) and 3 color-changing LEDs with a basic lithium-ion coin cell battery inside. Hats are designed to glow from the inside out or LEDs can go behind a featured object on the hat of your choice.</p>

<p>We cannot guarantee superpowers like the Resurrection Suit but we do expect you to rock this jacket with up to 36 LEDs attached in the color of your choice (also available in color-changing with basic programming).

</div></div>","HACKABLE: GET YOUR LED MODS ON!
HACKABLE wearable tech kits and mods are the first adaptable public releases from Toyshoppe Systems. Add light (+ power, communications, data and device connections) into anything you want to wear.
The engineering behind your favorite costumes can be applied to anything you want to light up. Use Hackable kits to add LEDs to your wearables, bikes, vehicles and anywhere or buy a custom piece!



As a Hollywood Effects Wizard Brent Heyning has designed physical and technical delights in 25 years of media engineering:
Major Movies (SpiderMan 2, Dark Knight Rises, Star Trek: Into Darkness, Tron, The Matrix and Star Wars trilogies + many sci-fi and blockbuster films) 
Musician Technical Effects (Daft Punk, Black Eyes Peas at Superbowl, Destroid, Rolling Stones, Metallica, Cheap Trick, Henry Strange, Eurovision)
Renegade & Indie Media (Lightning in a Bottle, Robot Combat League, The Ghastly Love of JohnnyX, Fly Me to the Moon, Oedipus, Team America: World Police)



Helmets coming soon will be the new evolution of this style with color-changing LEDs.


NOW ITS YOUR TURN TO LIGHT UP ANYTHING YOU DESIRE!
Many of these items will be offered here for the first time from Toyshoppe Systems, a team of talented makers and engineers in Los Angeles, CA. A few first look pieces are available for rush pickup this August and first kits will be out by late fall.

YOU ARE THE FIRST TO GET THESE KITS & MODS!
We have never before offered these incentives to the public and some items will never be offered again after this campaign - so now's your chance to make yourself into the object of art you've always dreamed about!




HACKABLE: ROAD AND FILM TESTED ENGINEERING
After Brent finished 77 helmets with Ironhead Studios for TRON: LEGACY we began to talk about taking the basic technology inside and putting it on everyday bike and cycle helmets. Our first prototype was worn by Evo for over 200 hours (over 100 hours on 1 9V battery!) and made it through a daytime car accident without getting destroyed. We found that we preferred the waterproof LEDs seen on the back of our first prototype helmet - they can be seen for TWO CITY BLOCKS when biking at night!

These LEDs are DURABLE - LONG LASTING - BRIGHT - EASY TO ADD ON

 We use a mix of LED in our wearables and encourage you to hack and mod your solutions with other sensors, accelerometers, el-wire, sound effects or anything that suits your creative vision! Hackable elements are designed to be modular, hackable and adaptable to easily integrate with your existing systems. 
Limited edition helmets, jackets and hats are available for men and women for the first and in some cases only time. You can send us your existing jacket to mod (stronger materials like leather are often easiest) or we can work with you to source the right piece for you. Batteries are included in your custom mods for ready-to-wear fashion.
There will only be 10 of these color-changing fashion designs:  
* Vintage Hat: Color-changing LED fascinator (from ComicCon 2013)
Your hat can include any items you want - send us your hat or objects and we'll construct a color-changing vintage hat for you. We provide a basic hat (fascinator or fedora) and 3 color-changing LEDs with a basic lithium-ion coin cell battery inside. Hats are designed to glow from the inside out or LEDs can go behind a featured object on the hat of your choice.

* Rebel Jacket: Your jacket or ours + up to 36 LEDs 
We cannot guarantee superpowers like the Resurrection Suit but we do expect you to rock this jacket with up to 36 LEDs attached in the color of your choice (also available in color-changing with basic programming). We will provide a leather jacket for you or send us one to mod. Let us know if you prefer us to mail you the pieces and instructions - you can always DIY with Hackable kits to add more functions and features.
No tesla coils on this one unless you come in for a custom design project with the Toyshoppe Systems crew. Thanks Will Keenan, costumer Kristina West and the cast & crew of the Ghastly Love of Johnny X!

<h3>Semper Fido Shirt Design</h3>
<p>We originally did this shirt as an entry for the Woot.com tee shirt derby. It didn't win, but it got a lot of votes (and has come closer to winning straight up than any other design we've done.)</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">INTRODUCING THE PODPLUG</span></h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""> </h2>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;"">We are Powering Us, a group of students at Ryerson University pursuing our Master's of Digital Media.

Our biggest concern is providing you with a quality product, and the </span><strong style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;letter-spacing: 0px;"">PodPlug</strong><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;""> is just that.</span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479086152/gybwriaabe6bb6thqal3.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></p>
<p>The <strong>PodPlug</strong> is attempting to limit the problems of the current traditional 3-prong outlet (electrocution, overheating and limiting ports for charging devices) and provide new and innovative alternatives to the clear plastic safety coverings that are inserted into the outlet to prevent electrocution, and by utilizing the <strong>PodPlug</strong> as a Smart Outlet.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Meet the PodPlug</h3>
<p>The PodBase plugs in and covers the wall outlet.  The base doesn't conduct electricity on its own so there's no risk of electrocution.  Lights, radios, phones and laptops can still be used by connecting them to the PodPlug which in turn pops into the PodBase.  Using induction charging the device is free to use.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479054813/gch7cddl63vvwtlwe2zo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Why is this important to us?</strong></h3>
<p>Like you (probably), we are tech fanatics and usually have multiple devices plugged in at once. Sometimes, we can forget to unplug or turn the devices off (the ""old"" age is catching up to us!). How awesome would it be to access our devices at home through the <strong>PodApp</strong>? It can be THAT simple. Now I don't need to worry about whether or not my hair straightener is going to cause a fire. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Meet the PodApp on your HomeKit           </h3>
<p>We also have come to the conclusion that regular three-prong outlets are safety hazards for most, especially for kids and pets. There will be no need to worry about ""baby or pet-proofing"" your home anymore, the <strong>PodPlug</strong> has you covered! No more unwanted ""parent stress"" about the possibility of electrocution. The <strong>PodPlugs</strong> use induction to transfer electricity, so the <strong>PodBase</strong> (where your 3-prong outlet once was) is safe to touch. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479054633/zhrb0vw57jrfuukvgehs.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>

</div></div>","INTRODUCING THE PODPLUG
 
We are Powering Us, a group of students at Ryerson University pursuing our Master's of Digital Media. We have created an energy efficient, convenient and safe outlet you can access through your home enabled app on your smartphone. Our biggest concern is providing you with a quality product, and the PodPlug is just that.

The PodPlug is attempting to limit the problems of the current traditional 3-prong outlet (electrocution, overheating and limiting ports for charging devices) and provide new and innovative alternatives to the clear plastic safety coverings that are inserted into the outlet to prevent electrocution, and by utilizing the PodPlug as a Smart Outlet.  
 
Meet the PodPlug
The PodBase plugs in and covers the wall outlet.  The base doesn't conduct electricity on its own so there's no risk of electrocution.  Lights, radios, phones and laptops can still be used by connecting them to the PodPlug which in turn pops into the PodBase.  Using induction charging the device is free to use.

 
Why is this important to us?
Like you (probably), we are tech fanatics and usually have multiple devices plugged in at once. Sometimes, we can forget to unplug or turn the devices off (the ""old"" age is catching up to us!). How awesome would it be to access our devices at home through the PodApp? It can be THAT simple. Now I don't need to worry about whether or not my hair straightener is going to cause a fire. 
 
Meet the PodApp on your HomeKit           
We also have come to the conclusion that regular three-prong outlets are safety hazards for most, especially for kids and pets. There will be no need to worry about ""baby or pet-proofing"" your home anymore, the PodPlug has you covered! No more unwanted ""parent stress"" about the possibility of electrocution. The PodPlugs use induction to transfer electricity, so the PodBase (where your 3-prong outlet once was) is safe to touch. 

 
The Journey So Far...
The PodPlug started as a design challenge that has quickly picked up steam.  Things have changed dramatically as the team at Powering Us have improved upon the original concept and brought onboard an engineering team to help bring the PodPlug to fruition. 



 
The PodPlug Package 
A single package includes one PodBase, and two PodPlugs. Expected retail price to be $50 CDN at launch, September 2018. 

Additionally....

PodBases will be sold individually
Pods will be sold in sets of two
USB and Nightlight specialty Pods will be sold separately

  Wipes are essential for kids. You need to be able to wipe tiny fingers and tushies when things start to get messy...which they always do. The front pocket of your ChangePal has been designed using velcro so that you can open the flap and extract a wipe with one hand. Parents get it.  Quite frankly, wipes are also great for adults to keep your hands and mouth clean or even to use in the bathroom, so this is a great option for anyone who had to use a public restroom. You can even use this pocket to carry around a medium bottle of hand sanitizer instead of wipes.   I hated digging through my diaper bag for diapers or trying to find them at home at 1 AM when I just need the baby to get back to sleep.

It’s just one more option to make it easier to organize your life.  There is absolutely no way we would put anything toxic next to our children.

<p>Our story began during a trip to Portugal in July 2016. Patrice had just left his job in the search of new challenges and Stéphanie, an elementary school teacher, allowed for them to have a full month of traveling during the summer.</p>
<p>One night after a ""love session"", the two decided to go to a restaurant in Lisbon city. The restaurant was a fantastic, cozy place serving good food, however, the moment was interrupted by an inconvenient situation in Stephanie’s jeans. This sparked a discussion on the differences between the things women and men must deal with daily which led to the idea that, wherever you are, you should always have the sensational feeling of wearing a fresh, clean pair of underwear.</p>
<p>Although Stéphanie did not get pregnant that night, the idea of a pair of underwear you can keep with you was born. We are now proud to present Undigo to the world.</p>

The available sizes will be Women's XS to Women's XXXL, or Men's S to Men's XXL. A further breakdown of the sizing is as follows. Women's XS Women's S Women's M/Men's S Women's L/Men's M Women's XL/Men's L Women's XXL/Men's XL Women's XXXL/Men's XXL</p><p><strong>How will you collect my size/will there be a survey to collect my size(s)?</strong></p><p>Yes. ~10 days after your Indiegogo pledge, a survey will be sent out to collect your sizing information and more information. The waiting period is 10 days, because that is when your funds are locked in. Keep an eye out for a survey via BackerKit.</p><p><strong>Does the Libre fit true to size?</strong></p><p>Yes, the Libre fits true to size for athletic/trim fit. Keep in mind that as a knit, the sweater will grow a little over time, so when it arrives and it feels a little snug, you should be fine. If you wear a medium/large, we recommend you plan for a large.</p><p><strong>How do you recommend cleaning the Libre?</strong></p><p>We recommend washing by hand with cold water + mild soap, laying it flat to dry, or dry cleaning it. The other option is using a front loading washing machine (not top loading/machines with agitator).</p><p><strong>Are Cream/Blue, Grey/Blue, and Navy Blue/ Light Cream the only colors currently available?</strong></p><p>Yes</p><p><strong>Can I swap out the hat and get a bigger discount on my Libre?</strong></p><p>No. The Libre is available at these early bird prices for backers and is already discounted from the $139.95 retail price. As a thank you for early backers, we decided to offer something else as a free item at our cost, similar to when other brands/retailers offer a free item when you purchase a certain item. This ended up being the trucker hat. If you'd rather not have a hat, we can hold off sending it to you, or you can give it to someone else who you think would enjoy it.</p><p><strong>Where does the name Cotopaxi come from?</strong></p><p>Cotopaxi is named after a volcano near Quito, Ecuador.</p><p><strong>What if I don't like my product?</strong></p><p>Cotopaxi products are guaranteed to last 61 years, the average lifespan of a person living in the developing world.

It’s based on the same principles used for dehairing cashmere, yielding the finest fibers possible for its “Cashmere of the Andes.” This fiber is then knitted to our specs to create the highly insulating, comfortable, and durable Libre sweater.Transparency and camaraderie stand at the center of this company, with a group of employees that has grown into a family within a superb working environment and excellent working conditions. The group we've partnered with proudly holds social and environmental sustainability as the company’s core values. Its strong commitment to social responsibility is evident throughout the company’s practices and production processes: 
It is WRAP (Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production) certified. 
All workers receive health and retirement benefits, paid vacation, and double pay for overtime. 
It provides food subsidies to factory workers. 
Ergonomic chairs for all of its workers. 
Close to 80% of its workforce are women; many of whom are the sole providers of their households. 
Preservation of Bolivia’s strong heritage of knitting by providing job opportunities through this trade. 
The use fiber dyes with low environmental impact. 
A water treatment plant has been mounted by its sister company and yarn provider to treat the production’s water residues. 
Low-carbon emissions through the use of natural gas as our main source for heating. 
The use of biodegradable plastic bags for shipping.

The available sizes will be Women's XS to Women's XXXL, or Men's S to Men's XXL. A further breakdown of the sizing is as follows. Women's XS Women's S Women's M/Men's S Women's L/Men's M Women's XL/Men's L Women's XXL/Men's XL Women's XXXL/Men's XXLHow will you collect my size/will there be a survey to collect my size(s)?Yes. ~10 days after your Indiegogo pledge, a survey will be sent out to collect your sizing information and more information. The waiting period is 10 days, because that is when your funds are locked in. Keep an eye out for a survey via BackerKit.Does the Libre fit true to size?Yes, the Libre fits true to size for athletic/trim fit. Keep in mind that as a knit, the sweater will grow a little over time, so when it arrives and it feels a little snug, you should be fine. If you wear a medium/large, we recommend you plan for a large.How do you recommend cleaning the Libre?We recommend washing by hand with cold water + mild soap, laying it flat to dry, or dry cleaning it. The other option is using a front loading washing machine (not top loading/machines with agitator).Are Cream/Blue, Grey/Blue, and Navy Blue/ Light Cream the only colors currently available?YesCan I swap out the hat and get a bigger discount on my Libre?No. The Libre is available at these early bird prices for backers and is already discounted from the $139.95 retail price. As a thank you for early backers, we decided to offer something else as a free item at our cost, similar to when other brands/retailers offer a free item when you purchase a certain item. This ended up being the trucker hat. If you'd rather not have a hat, we can hold off sending it to you, or you can give it to someone else who you think would enjoy it.Where does the name Cotopaxi come from?Cotopaxi is named after a volcano near Quito, Ecuador.What if I don't like my product?Cotopaxi products are guaranteed to last 61 years, the average lifespan of a person living in the developing world.

<h2>If you could try on any clothes from anywhere in the world, which clothes would you choose?</h2>
<p>Our fb page: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/grundergruppa"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/grundergruppa</a></p>
<p>Clothes are dynamic flexible objects with a personality photos cannot bring out. They are individual choices and their personality needs to match our own. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/572898/files/20140511221809-big_IMG_5725_20_281_29.jpg?1399871889"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>When buying clothes online we still have to use technology developed for paper; photo. The digital media have possibilities web stores have not begun to use. Because of this, most people still have an aversion to buying clothes online. <br/></p>
<p>Large dominant brands are selling us dreams. They dress up photo models and celebrities in tailor-made versions of their clothes, then Photoshop them until they are almost not recognizable. These pictures create a dream and illusion they sell us through media. </p>
<p><br/>How many of us have bought into this illusion only to find out we do not fit in the dream when the clothes arrives. Because of all the hassles of returning clothes, we end up putting them in the back of the closet, only getting rid of them when enough time has passed for our guilty conscience to let it happen.<br/><br/>This is not only bad for the environment, it is also putting a serious brake on online shopping and therefore our choices of stores and brands.<br/></p></span><strong><p><strong>The real power over what we buy are still with us; you and me.<br/>This is under the assumption we have any real choices in clothes we can try on.

<p>When you browse clothes through the ItsMeSee system, you can start the same way as you would do in any other clothing store: you browse clothes. The major difference is the ease and smoothness you can do this. There are no rows of photos, but hanging clothes you can flip through like you would in a store. You can even scroll the clothes on a mannequin to create outfits.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/598825/files/20140523020957-Prototype_1__dressingroom.png?1400836197"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>On the next level (if you want to spend some more time setting up) you can enter some basic sizing on the different parts of the body, like for pants, shirt or jacket. This takes only a few seconds. Now you will automatically get only the sizes you have set up, and you can see how things look.</p>
<p>If you want to set up even further, you can enter more measures and get a more accurate mannequin with your exact sizes. This will take perhaps 5-10 minutes.</p>
<p>On the next level you will take some pictures of yourself from different angles and the software will create a 3D silhouette of your body. This will be filled with a computer gaming figure With your shape and look. You enter some basic measures and the software will calculate the rest. This will take 15-30 min. Depending on how accurate you want this to be.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Now you can start trying on clothes. In the 3D dressing room you can set up parameters like prices, brands, colors,<br/>etc.</p>
<p>When you browse your mouse over different parts of the body you get choices of clothes to try on. If you pick a jacket you will get a wheel of jackets stretching out behind you. These jackets you can scroll on in any speed you want. The current jacket on your digital body will show as an ikon next to you. If you click on this ikon you zoom into that jacket. You can now shake it, turn it around and zoom into any detail.</p>

<p>When you finish putting together outfits, you can send your mannequin into a showroom. This you can do several times. When you have created enough outfits you can go into the showroom and see how each of them look. You can also invite family or friends into the showroom to get their opinion before you buy. If you wish you can also share any outfit on facebook or other social media.</p>

<p><br/>Some failed because the Technology at the time was not ready. Other ran into technical problems or limitations preventing them from showing the necessary quality.

If you could try on any clothes from anywhere in the world, which clothes would you choose?
Our fb page: https://www.facebook.com/grundergruppa
Clothes are dynamic flexible objects with a personality photos cannot bring out. They are individual choices and their personality needs to match our own. 

When buying clothes online we still have to use technology developed for paper; photo. The digital media have possibilities web stores have not begun to use. Because of this, most people still have an aversion to buying clothes online. 
Large dominant brands are selling us dreams. They dress up photo models and celebrities in tailor-made versions of their clothes, then Photoshop them until they are almost not recognizable. These pictures create a dream and illusion they sell us through media. 
How many of us have bought into this illusion only to find out we do not fit in the dream when the clothes arrives. Because of all the hassles of returning clothes, we end up putting them in the back of the closet, only getting rid of them when enough time has passed for our guilty conscience to let it happen.This is not only bad for the environment, it is also putting a serious brake on online shopping and therefore our choices of stores and brands.The real power over what we buy are still with us; you and me.This is under the assumption we have any real choices in clothes we can try on. Often this is not really the case as only a few dominating chains are available and within easy reach.
 The vision behind our project is to make the clothes universally available and bring out the full potential of the digital media. We are allowing you as a customer to try on clothes and to create whole outfits independent of brand and location.   Some surveys regarding online shopping The Online Fit Problem has three parts:
It is clearly impossible for online shoppers physically to try on clothes before they buy.
There is widespread inconsistency among retailers and brands in terms of size names, conventions and standards.  This makes online clothes shopping a challenge for six out of ten shoppers (Mintel, Fashion Online, March 2012).
The size of an item provides no information about the fit of that item.  There is no way to know how it will look on any individual person.
There are two direct consequences and one indirect consequence of the Online Fit Problem:

Buyer hesitation: buyers either never add the item to his/her basket, or fail to check out.  This happens because they are not confident about their choice.  The result for retailers is: low conversion rates.

High levels of garment returns: a customer who finds that a garment does not fit in the desired way will simply return the garment to the retailer.  Sometimes this is for an exchange, but usually for a refund.  The result for retailers is: high rates of costly garment returns.

We have been developing a system for showing clothes on any digital display (monitors, smart phones, pads etc) as close to the real thing as technology allows. We have spent years (since 2008) trying out technologies, finding solutions for problems we never knew was there until we hit it.   We have a couple of working prototypes ready. What we need Money for is to expand and redesign these platforms and add features . We are also modelling up as many clothes as we have funding for.  When this is ready we will present the future of clothing for Our funders first. All contributers will be asked to be Our beta testers, before we release to the general Public.  Where does my money go?Each piece of clothing requires a LOT of work to create the quality and realism we want. There are hundreds of parameters we need to tweak to create optimal simulations. We need to hire more people to scale up production and do some more programming. The showroom and dressing room platforms need to have many functions implemented as we only have some very basic things ready now. We have a couple of working prototypes ready. What we need Money for is to expand these platforms and add features. We are also modelling up as many clothes as we have funding for.  Even if we do not reach Our goal we should be able to createsomething amazing for you to try. Perhaps not with all the featuresand not as many clothes as we want.  RiskWe are not developing new technology, only doing some adaptations and programming. Everything we use is tested solutions and we know it works. In addition, we have already made simple versions of everything and know how it will turn out. Some challenges there will be, but nothing major.  Our teamWe are working closely with highly skilled people from Norway, India and The Philippines. We will also add people as we progress with our development. Our goalsWe  introduce a new standard for searching and buying clothes online. To improve old fashion and obsolete systems for digital web stores and showrooms. It is also our goal to give the consumer more saying in what clothes should be available each season.This would of course be clothes from different designers and brands from all over the world. We have several additional goals, which we will get back to after some further progress.If you are an investor or know someone who might be interested in investing in us, let us know.  Production timelineJuly: preparationsAugust: Production clearification and planningSeptember: Production startDesember: 1st  Prototype ready for beta testing (for contributers to try)April 2015: launch of full demo showroom for the global testing and demonstration

Just put the record on and spin the music. We bring the old good toy camera back to present!    We have design 4 different colors to fit all style!Black, White, Pink and Mixed, there must be one fit your desired (You'll pick when campaign ends)  We designed the Holga Digital for everyone from the first-time Holga user to the photography enthusiast. You’ll be snapping beautiful images in a matter of seconds. You don’t have to fiddling around with shutter speed, aperture, IOS, or white balance. But it gives you the freedom to experience Holga unique image style; different lenses or you can even mount external flashes onto the build in hot shoes.  Actual photos taken by Holga Digital  Actual photos taken by Holga Digital  Actual photos taken by Holga Digital       One thing that made Holga so unique is due to it image quality produced. The Holga Digital is a high-quality glass optic with F2.8 and F8.0 aperture setting to fit different environment and situation. Unlike any other digital camera on the market by producing vivid color and dark corner by firmware, we create our image quality by the optics.  Actual photos taken by Holga Digital  Actual photos taken by Holga Digital     With the new Holga Digital you can use your lens from the old Holga camera and pop them in by using a lens adaptor. This way you can share lens between your analog camera and the new Holga Digital.      We want to design a product that follows the great heritage of the Holga analog family. With no LCD, no extra setting you can enjoy the purity of photography. However, we know you like to share your work at a instant so the new Holga Digital can share photos in just a snap by using a WiFi SD card     The most well recognizable Holga must be the Holga 120N, this analog camera shot 120mm film to create 1:1 ratio square photos. We have embedded this feature into the new Holga digital. Now you can switch between 4:3 or 1:1 ratio photograph without doing any post-editing and share with your friends right the way!  Actual photos taken by Holga Digital      We’re using Hong Kong local plastic and electronics suppliers to produce parts that meet our high-tolerances. The most crucial part—the final assembly—is handled by highly-trained electro-mechanical assembly engineers in Hong Kong. Each unit is thoroughly tested before being packaged and shipped out.  We’re working with all the local designer, engineer, and manufacturer in Hong Kong to create a truly Made in Hong Kong product. Redefine the Hong Kong spirit. The most crucial part—the final assembly—is done right in Hong Kong. Each unit is tested, packaged and shipped right from here We were inspired by classic Holga camera and wanted to recreate the magical experience of using a Holga with our loved ones. We were also convinced we could enhance this experience by digitalize the original Holga.   The Holga Digital was conceived by our dedicated in-house development and design team; the entire project has been spearheaded by Holga founder Universal Electronics Industries Ltd.     To the Press.

What if there were one sports jacket that can give you multiple options to your style from day to evening wear? What if there were one sports jacket that can give you the same look that all your other jackets have in your closet and more?.

<br/><div>The Gimono Exchange - The Gimono Exchange is a (patent pending 62/269,258) sports jacket that can change it’s lapel and collar off its jacket and replace it with another lapel and collar to the owner's liking. He can have a traditional jacket with a notch lapel and unzip it off to replace it with a shawl lapel of a different color, texture, width, or fabric. This allows the customer to be more fashionable and creative with his sports jacket. If he wants to go to a sports bar and watch his favorite team but still look distinguish and casual, he can exchange the lapel to a hoodie in his team colors all with the same jacket. Gene Gimono is also working on newly style looks to attach to the jacket to give the male customer a more fashionable presence. All with the same jacket.</div>

<h2><b>Bio</b></h2>
<div><b></b></div>
<p>Gene is a fashion designer in Atlanta that has serviced his customers for over 10 years with great quality and style in custom clothing. He started with menswear but his women's collection carried his business to a well known designer. He has  shown his collection in New York Fashion Week, Milan, Atlanta, and Charleston. Now he plans to revive his menswear with a brand new concept for men.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>Get Creative With Your Blazer</h2>
<p>
Men’s fashion has start to change and more men are looking to be fashionable. The only problem is that women’s wear is the dominant industry so most designers get their ideas from  women’s trends and translate that into menswear. That direction has led to menswear looking more feminine than masculine. We have the jacket that will give you the style you want. </p>
<p>The one style that hasn’t changed is the male suit. It is usually a tradition suit with different options like 2 or 3 button, single breast or double breast, notch or peak lapel, patch or welt pockets, different colors and fabrics, etc. The silhouette and patterns stay the same. In a nut shell, menswear is boring. There aren't many personalities to the suit or sports jacket, no texture and lack of creative patterns and design. Gene Gimono is looking for your support to help him change that.</p>

What if there were one sports jacket that can give you multiple options to your style and personality? What if there were one sports jacket that can give you multiple options to your style from day to evening wear? What if there were one sports jacket that can give you the same look that all your other jackets have in your closet and more?. Look no further, we have the answer. 
The Gimono Exchange - The Gimono Exchange is a (patent pending 62/269,258) sports jacket that can change it’s lapel and collar off its jacket and replace it with another lapel and collar to the owner's liking. He can have a traditional jacket with a notch lapel and unzip it off to replace it with a shawl lapel of a different color, texture, width, or fabric. This allows the customer to be more fashionable and creative with his sports jacket. If he wants to go to a sports bar and watch his favorite team but still look distinguish and casual, he can exchange the lapel to a hoodie in his team colors all with the same jacket. Gene Gimono is also working on newly style looks to attach to the jacket to give the male customer a more fashionable presence. All with the same jacket.

</div></div>","Short Summary of Jacquezel 








Our designer/maker is also our founder. We produce a collection of beautifully handcrafted  bags and accessories in small handmade batches. 

We are also firm believers of women empowerment. We inject these elements and characters into our brand.


   WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP
Despite the fact that we are capable of producing these items by hand, we are out numbered by the orders that we receive and we would like to have some of the products made by our partnering manufacturers. We've picked out a couple of high-quality manufacturers that can produce the bags in large quantities but the upfront making costs for manufacturing are quite expensive. 
With your help and support, we'd love to expand the brand by acquiring better tools and materials to produce finer quality goods, and to have the products made by manufacturers.



WHAT YOU GET
 We are offering special discounts for our products on Indiegogo to encourage your help and support. Free shipping within Malaysia when you purchase MYR 150 above, and free worldwide shipping when you purchase US$ 200 above. 



































































































   Risks & Challenges In simple words, bags and accessories are what we do daily, and we have an experienced team looking after this Indiegogo project. Once we have received the funds, we will start on production immediately. We want to minimize the risk and maximize the satisfaction for our backers but we are not perfect and unexpected hurdles are not uncommon in manufacturing. Nevertheless, we are still very much confident that we've set ourselves achievable targets and delivery dates. In the unlikely event that anything should not run to plan, we will be sure to provide updates and to keep backers fully informed as we progress. 
International shipping:
Shipping internationally can be costly and should rates fluctuate, we will notify immediately. 

Duty/VAT charges: 
If you live outside of Malaysia, you will be responsible for any applicable duty/VAT charges.


Customs:

Some countries are known for being slow in customs, and we are sorry we won't be able to be much help in this area!

It is based on the Seebeck effect discovered in 1821. In the absence of an applied voltage gradient V, electric current, J, can still be generated if there is a temperature gradient, T. A thermoelectric material must have a low thermal conductivity and high electrical conductivity to function efficiently. These properties are not commonly found in nature.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">In order to make a thermoelectric material efficient, one must use a semiconductor whose Fermi level is tuned correctly by doping. Too much doping, and the Seebeck coefficient decreases. Too little doping and the electrical conductivity decreases. In addition, the semiconductor should have some mechanism to scatter phonons frequently. MATRIX has developed a nano-structured semiconductor, the Gemini, that accomplishes these things.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">MATRIX Mercury</h3><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1546676002/gumi7gpssgb8t30xlqvm.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">A thermoelectric module is composed of many tiny semiconductor ""legs"" that when added together create a larger voltage than one individual leg alone. However, the voltage generated by body heat is on the order of 20 to 100mV, too small to operate electronics. A DC-DC boost converter is needed to boost this small voltage to 5V to run the electronics and charge a battery.  Current off-the-shelf boosters have terrible efficiency and large startup voltage. MATRIX has developed the world's most efficient booster with the lowest startup voltage on the market today.

It is based on the Seebeck effect discovered in 1821. In the absence of an applied voltage gradient V, electric current, J, can still be generated if there is a temperature gradient, T. A thermoelectric material must have a low thermal conductivity and high electrical conductivity to function efficiently. These properties are not commonly found in nature.In order to make a thermoelectric material efficient, one must use a semiconductor whose Fermi level is tuned correctly by doping. Too much doping, and the Seebeck coefficient decreases. Too little doping and the electrical conductivity decreases. In addition, the semiconductor should have some mechanism to scatter phonons frequently. MATRIX has developed a nano-structured semiconductor, the Gemini, that accomplishes these things. MATRIX MercuryA thermoelectric module is composed of many tiny semiconductor ""legs"" that when added together create a larger voltage than one individual leg alone. However, the voltage generated by body heat is on the order of 20 to 100mV, too small to operate electronics. A DC-DC boost converter is needed to boost this small voltage to 5V to run the electronics and charge a battery.  Current off-the-shelf boosters have terrible efficiency and large startup voltage. MATRIX has developed the world's most efficient booster with the lowest startup voltage on the market today. We call it the MATRIX Mercury. Together the MATRIX Gemini and Mercury outperform any combination of thermoelectric and boost converter by 3X. To learn more, please visit www.matrixindustries.com  Matrix’s solar cell technology utilizes amorphous silicon that is superior to crystalline silicon when absorbing indirect and indoor light. The solar cell is laminated onto the display module for a seamless construction and optical clarity.  Matrix's team is composed of experts in thermoelectric material science, thermal engineering, and consumer product development and manufacturing. The core team consist of PhD graduates from Caltech, MIT, Harvard, and UCSD. Our manufacturing director has over 25 years of experience and has shipped millions of units for leading technology companies.The team was responsible for the award-winning success of the original PowerWatch, which debuted on Indiegogo.  PowerWatch exceeded its original crowdfunding goal by 938% in January of 2017 and successfully shipped all orders by fall 2018. The amazing feedback the team received from Indiegogo customers motivated them to push forward to manufacture the world's most powerful smartwatch, PowerWatch 2.",27.0,1,"4 Campaigns

<br/><p></p>
<p>After extensive testing of standard saddles we came to the conclusion that the structure of standard saddles is very limited &amp; does not allow other specific adaptations. Upon completion of our study program we began experimentation with new saddle structural designs &amp; material compositions that could potentially unite the individual needs of riders from all categories on one platform. <br/></p>

<span></span><b><i><u>Brand story</u></i></b>
</span></span><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><p>MORGAW® seats <span>was established in 2008,
founded by longtime friends Martin Moravcik (Slovakia)
and Slawek Gawlik (Poland).
Both of us, Martin &amp; Slawek are former MTB pro riders. Since 2010 we have been producing ultra-light full
carbon saddles (weight totaling 100 grams foam core with leather covering) from our small production facility in Slovakia.</span></p>
<p>From our customer <span>service,
manufacturing &amp; riding experience, we have
identified key deficiencies
in <span>design elements. By late 2010 our core focus
shifted to New Product Development (NPD), concentrating on revolutionary
compositions.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Since 2011 we started <span>development on a
new design which could potentially eliminate saddle deficiencies while at the same time met the needs
of professional &amp; active riders. </span></span></p>
<p>MORGAW® is a
European company, head office based in Slovakia where
all <span>research &amp; design innovations are developed with our international office based in
Taiwan with our manufacturing facility.</span></p>

<br/>SADDLE<span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><p>The
essential<span> characteristics for a performance
seat are comfort &amp; light weight. Achieving
comfort in the racing category for saddles wasn’t an easy
task at all. The basic elements of comfort
reside in ergonomic contour design, saddle width, foam density &amp; shock
absorption. </span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/149875/files/20131023055450-CATALOGUE_-_2014_-_INDIEGOGO_Page_10.jpg?1382532890"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Throughout our teams extensive testing

</span>Within our design we have developed<span> a revolutionary patented saddle with a unique &amp;
self - supporting platform, which is based on shock absorbers.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/149877/files/20131023055635-CATALOGUE_-_2014_-_INDIEGOGO_Page_03.jpg?1382532995"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<span>The</span> <span>shock absorbers are high demanding in terms of the possibility to adapt various density suited to the
weight of </span><span>the rider, light weight saddle which creates riding
comfort, stability &amp; reliability.This
unique platform combined with shock absorbers
allows the saddle
to be divided into two self - supporting entities: seat
&amp; undercarriage .The design has opened a
new structure of possibilities which allow us
to incorporate the key performance characteristics into our saddle. Shock absorbers will be sold in three
stifnesses categories which are based on riders weight &amp; compatibility.

<span>Active &amp; professional
riders <span>understand the issues of crooked,
cracked &amp; broken rails, especially with carbon material. For conventional
seats these issues often render the saddle useless &amp; in many cases, expensive functional seats are discarded due to damaged rails. </span></span>MORGAW® <span>seat designs allow the rider</span><span> to exchange every component <span>when you need &amp; as often as you like, including rails. All components
will be available to buy as separate spare parts.<br/><br/></span></span><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><p><span><span></span></span></p>

<p>A key aspect of MORGAW® saddles <span>functionality is compatibility &amp; customization. Our patented design allows for MORGAW</span>®i nterchangeable seats to be fitted to the<span> same
platform <span>of rails
&amp; shock absorbers. With four (4)screws you may change the entire saddle for a different ergonomic
design &amp; shape without loosening the rails from the seat post. In practicality
this means you can replace damaged saddles or
alternatively swap the seat more efficiently
while rails &amp; shock absorbers remain intact.
The seat component itself will
be available in a very
convenient price structure, same as the rails &amp; other key components.</span></span></p>

our own private money &amp; with assistance from
our relatives. As our project expanded &amp; evolved to it’s current position the demand for greater funding increased. At this point we have secured private financial
investors that have allowed our team in Taiwan to
finalize the production developments &amp; implementation of initial
prototyping.</span></p>
<p><span> Our final stage now is mass production which requires further
funding. Therefore, we turn
to you through indiegogo.com

Upon completion of our study program we began experimentation with new saddle structural designs & material compositions that could potentially unite the individual needs of riders from all categories on one platform. 

Brand story
MORGAW® seats was established in 2008,
founded by longtime friends Martin Moravcik (Slovakia)
and Slawek Gawlik (Poland).
Both of us, Martin & Slawek are former MTB pro riders. Since 2010 we have been producing ultra-light full
carbon saddles (weight totaling 100 grams foam core with leather covering) from our small production facility in Slovakia.
From our customer service,
manufacturing & riding experience, we have
identified key deficiencies
in design elements. By late 2010 our core focus
shifted to New Product Development (NPD), concentrating on revolutionary
compositions.
Since 2011 we started development on a
new design which could potentially eliminate saddle deficiencies while at the same time met the needs
of professional & active riders. 
MORGAW® is a
European company, head office based in Slovakia where
all research & design innovations are developed with our international office based in
Taiwan with our manufacturing facility.


SADDLEThe
essential characteristics for a performance
seat are comfort & light weight. Achieving
comfort in the racing category for saddles wasn’t an easy
task at all. The basic elements of comfort
reside in ergonomic contour design, saddle width, foam density & shock
absorption. 

Throughout our teams extensive testing
& observations, we were able to identify
another key element that allowed light movement in
the saddle, making it more responsive to the rider’s body movement.

Within our design we have developed a revolutionary patented saddle with a unique &
self - supporting platform, which is based on shock absorbers.
The shock absorbers are high demanding in terms of the possibility to adapt various density suited to the
weight of the rider, light weight saddle which creates riding
comfort, stability & reliability.This
unique platform combined with shock absorbers
allows the saddle
to be divided into two self - supporting entities: seat
& undercarriage .The design has opened a
new structure of possibilities which allow us
to incorporate the key performance characteristics into our saddle. Shock absorbers will be sold in three
stifnesses categories which are based on riders weight & compatibility.
Soft 40kg - 70kg, Medium 70kg - 85kg &
Hard 85kg -100kg.



Active & professional
riders understand the issues of crooked,
cracked & broken rails, especially with carbon material. For conventional
seats these issues often render the saddle useless & in many cases, expensive functional seats are discarded due to damaged rails. MORGAW® seat designs allow the rider to exchange every component when you need & as often as you like, including rails. All components
will be available to buy as separate spare parts.


A key aspect of MORGAW® saddles functionality is compatibility & customization. Our patented design allows for MORGAW®i nterchangeable seats to be fitted to the same
platform of rails
& shock absorbers. With four (4)screws you may change the entire saddle for a different ergonomic
design & shape without loosening the rails from the seat post. In practicality
this means you can replace damaged saddles or
alternatively swap the seat more efficiently
while rails & shock absorbers remain intact.
The seat component itself will
be available in a very
convenient price structure, same as the rails & other key components.


Aside
from technical innovation we concentrated on achieving simplistic & stylish  design
elements that were easily customized to accommodate his or hers color taste. You can futher customize your seat with the accessory color kit which will be available in ten (10) different colors.




MORGAW® saddles first release will
be available in three skin color options:
Black, White & Silver. Each seat has a specially
designed non slip grip ,lightly embossed pattern created for additional hold in rainy conditions & is
gentle to your lycra cycling shorts for road
bike cyclists. 


All saddle designs by MORGAW® have
passed EN tests & criteria. Your  MORGAW® saddle & products will be
authenticated with EN certificate.


All MORGAW saddles are compatible with most of the seatposts, even a dropper ones. In case it's not, you may have to get a clamp kit for your seatpost to make it compatible.MORGAW SEATPOSTSimilar to the saddle, we identified seat post deficiencies & created a solution as
saddle & seatposts combine for overall performance. We believe our design successfully embodies the needs of
riders in our collection of MORGAW®seat
posts. FOR MORE INFO AND DIAMETERS CHECK OUR GALLERY!










WHERE WE ARE NOW
After completion of the development stages we are now ready for major production. 


The challenges
with new product design allowed us to experiment with many various material
compositions & manufacturing techniques. Initially our project aim was to
manufacture from our European HQ however after extensive analysis of materials
& direction our company has taken, the evaluation of our production we
decided to base our manufacturing in the centralized hub of Taiwan as our
growth, capacity & international expansion is pivotal to the success of the
company.


 With all components manufactured in close proximity to our Taiwan
offices, our team has been based in Taiwan for the past 12 months, overseeing
the entire manufacturing processes to ensure our projects meet the high
standards created during our research & development stages.



Background funding of our project
In the very
beginning our project has been financed from
our own private money & with assistance from
our relatives. As our project expanded & evolved to it’s current position the demand for greater funding increased. At this point we have secured private financial
investors that have allowed our team in Taiwan to
finalize the production developments & implementation of initial
prototyping.
 Our final stage now is mass production which requires further
funding. Therefore, we turn
to you through indiegogo.com
with a request to continue
supporting our project.

OUR GOALS
Our project is split into three (3)
following stages:
1st Stage: Development of saddle platform – completed.
2nd Stage: Implementation of product to mass
production & sales strategizing – current  
3rd Stage: a, Expand
MORGAW® racing saddle
collection
  b,
Launch City bike & Kids bike saddle collections into market
  c, Include full carbon saddles into our product range (carbon corpus)
  d, Finalize development of applications that evaluate real
time riding (RTR) using compatible systems for android & iOS. Sequential
sensors strategically positioned within the saddle transfers weight &
distribution data of the rider via Bluetooth to your MORGAW® app on smartphone & tablet devices,
evaluating precise body movement, shock absorption, etc. , recommending future
refinements in saddle selection within the MORGAW® saddle products.

<b>Control at your fingertips… literally</b>
<p>
Ola’s FPC1020 Capacitive Touch Fingerprint Sensor offers 
state-of-the-art fingerprint technology. That means efficient energy 
consumption, 256 grey scale values in every single pixel, and durability
 against wear and tear for 10 million cycles. Ola’s capacitive sensor 
can also read the arches, loops and whirls of your finger, even if 
covered or dirty. So when we say no more key and no more smart phone, we
 really mean it. Just register your fingerprint for the first time, then
 forget about your phone permanently.</p>
<h1><b>Bluetooth 4.0 connectivity</b></h1>
<p><b>Sharing
</b></p>
<p>We also want Ola to bring comfort and ease to the people you 
care about. You can share access instantly with family and friends 
through Ola’s simple yet intelligent app. You can invite people with 4 
different settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Temporary: From 11/06 11.00 am to 21/06 21.00 pm </li>
<li>Recurring: Every Sundays from 2 to 5 pm and every Wednesdays from 10 am to 2 pm</li>
<li>Permanent: All time access.</li>
<li> Master: All time access + gives the right to invite people, keep open, rename or delete lock... 
 </li>
</ul>
<p>And in 2 different ways: </p>
<ul>
<li>Bluetooth access: generates a link you can send via email or a QR code. </li>
<li> Fingerprint access: Fingerprint needs to be registered on Ola at the time of the invite.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Temporary Keys</b></p>
<p>We know not everyone is welcome all 
the time, though, so you can schedule temporary keys for visitors or 
guests. This makes it easy not only to give access, but to restrict it.</p>

<br/><p>We are a team of young entrepreneurs whose goal is to improve the

Today we have realized that dream. The world's first true smart lock, 
Ola, is here. Technologically advanced, and wirelessly connected, Ola’s 
fingerprint technology is completely self-contained. It can recognize 
approved users through a touch of the finger, or in the “old-fashioned”

<p><b>WHY WE NEED YOU</b></p>
<p>The hard part is done. We invented Ola. 
Now we need your help in bringing Ola to the public. Of course funding 
is important, but we also want your feedback, your experiences, and your
 enthusiasm. We’ve had Ola installed on our door for months. We know it 
works. Other offices in our hallway have even started using it. But mass
 production is expensive and we need your support to realize our vision 
of sharing Ola with the world.</p>
<h1>HELP US SPREAD THE NEWS

<p>When we say we want Ola to change the world, we really mean it. 
The lock as an invention has remained the same for hundreds if not 
thousands of years. The time has come to bring this ancient but

only makes the key obsolete, but makes our homes more secure. To back 
Ola is to step into the future. </p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>31 months after we began, Ola is finally ready for some attention. We
 spent a lot of our own money, but we believe in our vision, and have 
tirelessly refined Ola with the feedback of alpha-testers. Now we need 
you for the final stages. </p>
<p>We have the energy to keep going, but the cost of producing 10 units 
is nothing compared to the cost of producing 500 units. Our real 
challenge is raising funds to manufacture in mass. Help us overcome this

recognize you in less than a second, unlocking your door the moment you 
touch the handle?""Other smart locks take longer than regular 
locks, even more than 30 seconds to take out your phone, connect to 
Bluetooth, and unlock your door. But is that really ‘progress'? Technology
 should make life easier, not more complicated. That’s why Ola has a 
fingerprint sensor integrated into the door handle. Register your 
fingerprint directly on the handle, and then forget about your keys and 
phone. Ola is completely self-contained. All it needs is you.The FirstOla
 is the first smart lock on the market to incorporate Bluetooth 4.0 
connectivity and capacitive fingerprint technology, making Ola not only 
keyless but phoneless.
 The FastestThe days of searching for keys or fumbling 
through smart phone apps are officially over. Ola has incorporated one 
of the best fingerprint sensors on the market (the FPC1020AM from 
Sweden) which means that you can unlock Ola in under a second.
The Longest
We test-opened Ola over 31,042 times with 
one set of 4 AA-batteries, which is the equivalent of two years of 
normal use. We also included a button that activates the back up 
AAA-battery. The backup uses Panasonic Evolta batteries that hold the 
Guinness world record for longest shelf life, and gives Ola a total 
battery life of about 7 years. In case of an emergency, you can power 
Ola with a micro USB.

VOLGGER Studio was founded in 2016. The last two years were filled with ups and downs of a start-up. VOLGGER Studio has invested all of it’s passion into a genderequal collection design, that is not only timeless but also ready to wear. We’ve created and refined our cuts, aiming for a perfect fit.  Regina and Jasmin toured around to establish a European supply chain. VOLGGER Studio maintains personal contact with all its business partners - from suppliers to manufacturers.</p><p>Another milestone has been the creation of a corporate identity that is not only the platform to convey the message and the principles VOLGGER Studio stands for, but also lays out a solid foundation for the future of the company.</p><p>We’ve come this far - help us to take VOLGGER Studio to the next level and bring our fashion to the people. In order to be able to start selling/reselling our collection, we need to pre-finance the first production run of the CORE collection. In detail we will use the raised money for financing the production of four looks of our CORE collection.</p><p><br/><strong>With your support we can :</strong><br/>- kick start the first production run of our CORE collection<br/>- bridge the gap between collection design and sales<br/>- help raise gender awareness<br/>- make a greater impact in the lives of many</p><p> </p><h3><strong>What does VOLGGER Studio stand for?</strong></h3><p>Gender equality, sustainability, transparency and quality – these are our guiding principles.</p><p>VOLGGER Studio convinces with superior quality fashion, that is not only timeless and rich in detail, but also gender equal. We use production facilities around Europe, such as Italy, Poland and Slovakia to produce high quality denim wear next to a fine selection of natural fabric based pieces. We source our fabrics only from European business partners and both aim for eco-friendly production standards and sustainability along the production chain. We do our best to live up to our business standards for every component of our fashion items - from zippers, to our sewing threads to our hang tags.</p><p> </p><p><strong>CORE collection and gender equality</strong></p><p>An essential aspect of the VOLGGER Studio philosophy is addressing gender issues. The importance of gender equality and respectful treatment of people beyond gender stereotypes is reflected in the products of VOLGGER Studio. The CORE collection breaks with classical collection design approaches and moves beyond gender stereotypes as there is one single collection that focuses more on commonalities – the CORE – of both sexes than rather their differences. </p><p>The CORE collection is ‚a year-round collection’, consisting of 12 looks: one look for each month a year. VOLGGER Studio’s core strength is the design of perfect fitting denim jeans, shirts, jackets/coats, tees &amp; tops. However, the collection is rounded up by a selection of finest designed and produced knit items. Discreet color shades such as blue, black, grey, beige and white dominate the range of colors.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Ways to support VOLGGER Studio</strong></h3><p>The primary goal of our crowdfunding project is to raise 19,000 EUR for the first production run of the CORE collection. However, we appreciate any help. If you can’t financially support us, but do believe in our project - please help us raise awareness for our cause!</p><p><br/><strong>How to make some noise:</strong><br/>- share the campaign over social media (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter - the more, the better) <br/>- share the campaign link to with your friends who you think will love VOLGGER Studio via email<br/>- help us to connect with people that you think could be supporting our project by emailing <a href=""mailto:info@volgger-studio.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">office@volgger-studio.com</a> <br/>- follow us on social media <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/volggerstudio"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.facebook.com/volggerstudio</a> and <a href=""http://www.instagram.com/volggerstudio)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.instagram.com/volggerstudio</a></p><p>We are grateful for your support - help us to bring our fashion and our message to the people!</p><p>Regina &amp; Jasmin</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498492546/j3jkxgeupnkl6ypbxljw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498492468/yyjo7kp3w1kgmj67fqrb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498492333/vywcicfwcokr8vfsn4za.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498908989/pxs8m76eqhxsochczupc.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498492270/i0niur7fcxnropxkrxyv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498491960/mcitvtdxkg6hbibqjwzo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498491889/vfodyaqt91rft5ywsviw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498491851/knjh0aajo3qasydd9isa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498491823/cnibaf7yqwlm17cm2h0f.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498491792/trxi4t4xatvsvlof6yos.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498491344/xpnh4l3d1zgrs9izpz5j.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498994317/sn7c1jch59cukt1tdazr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498909055/ceoomkzfxckf92pijlor.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498490542/yq12tve8eqhrrimxzfzl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498490513/ievpek7gtad7e6g9nbv8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498909100/ocrbdmneaapornsczdso.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498490254/auhmrjqssiu2pgk5yiht.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498490135/h1lfbuxkxfp17orvezqh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498489771/w1wm14fjf407rlcj9vp8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498728823/tcn2v8ge7kwxxeqdwffn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3> </h3><p> </p><h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3><p>Every business endevaour is asocciated with a certain degree of risk.

A motorcyclist is 5 times more likely to become injured in a crash. 
Over 60% of motorcycle accidents are caused by 
another vehicle hitting the motorcycle. 
 
 


 
Gear That Fits Protects! 
Female anatomy is different than male. Women need gear that fits our bodies.
 


Over 1.5 million women in the USA alone are riding. 
More women take it up everyday. Still, the gear choices for women are sparse. In a typical gear store, the women’s section is one rack. 



Imagine 
You bought your first bike, next you go buy a rad motorcycle jacket. 
The shop smells like leather, racing suits hang on the wall, bad ass riders grin at you from posters. Then it dawns in you, it’s all dudes.
There is one women’s rack, which someone vomited pastel pink flowers over.
Disappointing is an understatement. Buxom, bootylicious, over size six ? 
Forget about looking good and protection.  
 
Raven Rova Fixed That Problem. 



Five years ago my friend was in a serious crash, he survived. 
It was a wake up call. My husband and I went to buy ALL THE GEAR. 
I’d been riding my whole life with only my helmet. 
 
I was furious and disappointed by the lack of gear! 
Since then I’ve invested thousands of dollars and hours into R&D. 
 
My manufacturing team has been making motorcycle gear since 1969. 
I have been a fashion designer for over 10 years.

What Women Want
We Asked, You Answered
 
“Properly fitting gear that flatters my shape and isn't pink or ugly.”
 
“Please consider us ladies with athletic thighs and larger calves - I can’t wear most skinny jeans because my calves already barely fit in my boots, let alone with jeans on them!”
 
“I like to be able to pee easily and dont wanna have to bother with a suit.”
 
“Pants made for real women sizes, not just the small sizes.”
 
“Jackets that fit my boobs and allow me to move my arms and have a waist,
is that too much to ask?”
 
“More gear for women that move with our bodies. Our body shapes have such a wide range that it hard for anyone over a 12 to find flattering, comfortable gear in a decent price range.”
 
“Modern minimalist but sexy leather for riding moto!”

<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">When you're done listening to your iPod or cell, what happens to your headphones?</span></h3>
<p></p>
<p>My name is Peggy Rajski, and I use my headphones a <i>lot</i>. Putting
them away should be simple and fast. But I
was frustrated by how long it always took me to untangle them or find them in
my purse or my house.  And I hated how
much I spent replacing my headphones because I lost them or the wires shorted
out!  That’s why I created OKIOTO. </p>
<p>OKIOTO looks cool, is easy to use, and feels comfortable when you
wear it.  It takes about 5 seconds to attach your headphones, then only
seconds to wrap and unwrap them every single time you use them. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""435"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fd9PgBoVe7s?feature=oembed"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p>Because your headphones always stay attached to OKIOTO, they're faster to wrap, easier to find, and way more fun to use.  Even better, it save your headphones a lot of wear and tear so they last longer!</p>
<p>It's simple.  Wear, wrap, store and repeat.  OKIOTO saves you time, saves you headaches and saves your headphones!</p>

<p>For
more than a year, I’ve been working with a mechanical engineer, manufacturers and 3-D prototypes to work out a ton of design details—height, weight, shape, feel, wrapping proportions, edge tapering, etc. —all the small but incredibly important things that make OKIOTO
work as easily as it does.  After testing different
materials and manufacturing approaches, we're finally ready to take OKIOTO into production!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Now we need $25,000 dollars to make it all happen. At that level, we'll
have enough money to make the mold for the first design—the Butterfly in orange—and place the order for our first production run with the seasoned manufacturer we have lined up. We'll complete the packaging design and be able to start shipping OKIOTOs
within 4-6 weeks of completing this campaign.</p>

<p>So we'd love to have your support!  And if you are able to contribute $20, you’ll get a limited edition OKIOTO Butterfly

<h3>About the Inventor</h3>
<p>I’m an Oscar-winning producer, script and film consultant, and professor at NYU.  I love taking on challenges--big and small--and coming up with creative solutions.  I even created a very successful not-for-profit organization—The Trevor Project--from scratch to help address an important issue that was at the heart of my film TREVOR.  So problem-solving is in my nature.  And OKIOTO was the answer I came up with to a problem I found really vexing on a daily basis!</p>
<p>There's another thing about myself that relates to OKIOTO.  I really enjoy helping other people.  I’ve been a mentor or a teacher of sorts pretty much my whole life. Helping make things just a little bit easier for other people is one of the rewards I get out of doing this...and it's one I hope you'll enjoy too when you give your support!</p>

<p><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;""><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;"">Hi, my Name is Aytunc and I am the Founder of Moonbronze. Moonbronze is a watch brand from Germany specialized in high-quality Swiss Made watches with exclusive design. I was fed up with the prices that most luxury watch retailers demanded, which I found overpriced. My vision was and is that everyone should have the opportunity to enjoy the look and feel of a luxury watch without having to pay thousands of euros for this privilege. That's why I set myself the goal of offering beautiful and luxurious timepieces for everyone at a fair price. Therefore, I founded Moonbronze and create since then the design for unique watches made from the best materials, of which now the first collection is available for you.</font></font><br/> </p>

Hi, my Name is Aytunc and I am the Founder of Moonbronze. Moonbronze is a watch brand from Germany specialized in high-quality Swiss Made watches with exclusive design. I was fed up with the prices that most luxury watch retailers demanded, which I found overpriced. My vision was and is that everyone should have the opportunity to enjoy the look and feel of a luxury watch without having to pay thousands of euros for this privilege. That's why I set myself the goal of offering beautiful and luxurious timepieces for everyone at a fair price. Therefore, I founded Moonbronze and create since then the design for unique watches made from the best materials, of which now the first collection is available for you.

There are coffees to order, bars to attend, gym sessions to smash, good-looking people to impress. And let’s face it, most shorts just can’t handle the pace. We're sick of shorts that can’t take us where we want to go. We’re sick of them falling down and riding up. We’re sick of washing day. And most of all, we’re sick of having to get changed all the time. Surely getting dressed once a day is enough to expect of a man. But we didn’t want to whinge. We wanted a solution.

The most common reason was that they fall down when you bend over (AKA: the dreaded plumber’s crack!). So, we set out on a mission to find a solution. After countless wearer trials and R&amp;D, we discovered that shape and the waistband’s stretchability are key factors to a short’s staying power. We learnt: a curved waistband holds bit better when you’re standing still, but if you bend over or reach for the stars, your backside is left exposed. We worked with the world’s best manufacturers to create a one-of-a-kind, never seen before, five-piece waistband. Fast forward more than two years – after countless wearer trials, testing and plenty of prototypes, we’ve found a new solution… Introducing the AptGrip waistband, proudly making the dreaded plumber’s crack a thing of the past.</p><div data-id=""14455429""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1481041368/xnvr1uwzolszsm9rmjr1.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><p>  </p><div data-id=""14457905""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1481041370/yp91ccqkvrod3pcsj3z2.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><p>We worked with our manufacturers to engineer a 360-degree stretch premium fabric which infused with silver. Silver is naturally oligodynamic that eliminates bacteria (and BO). By fusing our fabric with silver, these antimicrobial properties are ingrained in the fabric and makes it odourless. But we didn't stop there, We created a brand new fabric infusing with Hydrophobic Nanotechnology. That makes our Non-stop shorts will stain resistant or any type of liquid will just roll off and dry faster than your regular shorts. That also means you can avoid laundry duty for up to 3 weeks (just don’t tell your girlfriend). </p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/WqwI8QQ6Erk?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1481041371/ece2yraxhnucc75haeep.jpg"" src="""" style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'/></p><p>Phone?

<p>FAQ's</p>
<p>Does Cobba pay international customs duty, tax and fee?</p>
<p>For international contributors, an understanding of import fees is important. For all orders outside Australia, sometimes the customs department of your country can demand import duty. In this case- the duty would have to be taken care of by the contributor. It’s a good idea to contact your local customs office, so you don’t receive any unexpected fees.</p>
<p>Exchanges are processed as new orders, and the authorities may attempt to charge you again. If this occurs, inquire locally on how to request a refund on prior fees.</p>
<p>If you wish to refuse your delivery, you will still be held responsible for the status of your parcel and most of the couriers will only keep the parcel 14 days period maximum until import tax will be paid then the parcel will be destroyed.</p>
<p>Please note that we do not have any arrangements with couriers to get your parcel returned to us since the return fees exceed the amount of your order including shipping costs and their administration fees. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>How do I select my size, colour, and length ?</p>
<p>As soon as the Indiegogo confirms, we’ll send you a survey to complete where you can let us know your size, length and color preferences. Please make sure to follow our size charts and how to measure guide during the selection. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>What happens if I order the wrong size shorts? Can I return? Does Cobba accept exchanges?</p>
<p>Yes, we accept exchanges but need to check our stock availability at time of the exchange.</p>
<p>Your support on Indiegogo is designed to help us bring our product to life, and enables you early access to our new products at a discount. Because of this special arrangement, we do not accept returns of Indiegogo products for refunds.<br/>But, we will gladly exchange any unused items in original packages if we have an extra stock of your new selection. All we ask is that you cover the shipping cost of the return and replacement.</p>
<p>So we strongly recommend you to follow ""our size charts"" and ""how to measure guide"" during size selection. If you have trouble selecting correct size, please write to us directly. We will work with our sizing experts on picking the right size for you.</p></figure></div></div>","When you’re an urban warrior, life never stops.

That’s why we created the world's first Non-Stop Shorts. Our Journey started two and half years ago when it dawned on us our friends didn’t like their shorts. The most common reason was that they fall down when you bend over (AKA: the dreaded plumber’s crack!). So, we set out on a mission to find a solution. After countless wearer trials and R&D, we discovered that shape and the waistband’s stretchability are key factors to a short’s staying power. We learnt: a curved waistband holds bit better when you’re standing still, but if you bend over or reach for the stars, your backside is left exposed. We worked with the world’s best manufacturers to create a one-of-a-kind, never seen before, five-piece waistband. Fast forward more than two years – after countless wearer trials, testing and plenty of prototypes, we’ve found a new solution… Introducing the AptGrip waistband, proudly making the dreaded plumber’s crack a thing of the past.  We worked with our manufacturers to engineer a 360-degree stretch premium fabric which infused with silver. Silver is naturally oligodynamic that eliminates bacteria (and BO). By fusing our fabric with silver, these antimicrobial properties are ingrained in the fabric and makes it odourless. But we didn't stop there, We created a brand new fabric infusing with Hydrophobic Nanotechnology. That makes our Non-stop shorts will stain resistant or any type of liquid will just roll off and dry faster than your regular shorts. That also means you can avoid laundry duty for up to 3 weeks (just don’t tell your girlfriend). Phone? Check. Keys? Check. Credit card? Check. With Non-slip self-sealing hidden pocket bags, there are places to put all your essentials. The fine details are the heart of our products and they are what we spend most of our time on. We designed the perfect solution to stash your stuff and you can be wallet free.Sneaky phone pocket  Hidden card pocket  Handy key pocket  Emergency back pocket
 Our shorts also come in two leg lengths. Because we'll never agree about which one's better. And who knows, you might even swing all the ways.     
Waistband Closure  Our shorts come in four colours. Manson BlackThis shady character shuns the limelight – choosing to sit on the sidelines instead. While easy going, there’s something mysterious about Manson: a hint of danger, a dark side, or a murky past.Cobain BlueTake a walk on the mild side with cool kid Cobain. Never a ruffled feather or a sharp word, this is one chilled character – light on small talk, but heavy on meaning. Blue waters run deep.Redford RedNever backwards in coming forward, Redford is a colourful character (and hard to miss in a crowd). Centre of attention, life of the party, king of the world – there’s never a dull moment when Red’s around.Dark GreyChosen by the community of backers. Mid Length
 Knee Grazer   Our shorts will be manufactured in sizes S-XL in both leg lengths, and will cover waist sizes 30""all the way to 38"". The detailed size guide will be available when we send out the surveys.  What does Cobba mean?Proudly designed in Sydney, Australia As Australians, we love adventures.We say when adventure comes your way, you want to be ready for anything. The only hard part: finding accessories that can keep up with you. A car that can go from Surry Hills to St. Kilda on a single tank. A mate who can get in everywhere (and get away with everything). A phone that never dies mid-swipe. And clothes that are just the right fit, for any occasion. That’s why Cobba was born. Taking cues from cutting edge technology, our experienced menswear design and production team created the world's first Non-Stop shorts that actually can fit in everywhere you go.  Please support our campaign.

FAQ's
Does Cobba pay international customs duty, tax and fee?
For international contributors, an understanding of import fees is important. For all orders outside Australia, sometimes the customs department of your country can demand import duty. In this case- the duty would have to be taken care of by the contributor. It’s a good idea to contact your local customs office, so you don’t receive any unexpected fees.
Exchanges are processed as new orders, and the authorities may attempt to charge you again. If this occurs, inquire locally on how to request a refund on prior fees.
If you wish to refuse your delivery, you will still be held responsible for the status of your parcel and most of the couriers will only keep the parcel 14 days period maximum until import tax will be paid then the parcel will be destroyed.
Please note that we do not have any arrangements with couriers to get your parcel returned to us since the return fees exceed the amount of your order including shipping costs and their administration fees. 
 
How do I select my size, colour, and length ?
As soon as the Indiegogo confirms, we’ll send you a survey to complete where you can let us know your size, length and color preferences. Please make sure to follow our size charts and how to measure guide during the selection. 
 
What happens if I order the wrong size shorts? Can I return? Does Cobba accept exchanges?
Yes, we accept exchanges but need to check our stock availability at time of the exchange.
Your support on Indiegogo is designed to help us bring our product to life, and enables you early access to our new products at a discount. Because of this special arrangement, we do not accept returns of Indiegogo products for refunds.But, we will gladly exchange any unused items in original packages if we have an extra stock of your new selection. All we ask is that you cover the shipping cost of the return and replacement.
So we strongly recommend you to follow ""our size charts"" and ""how to measure guide"" during size selection. If you have trouble selecting correct size, please write to us directly. We will work with our sizing experts on picking the right size for you.",35.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>Atlas Motion Tracking is back. Our bleeding-edge machine learning system is built based on our experience studying human motion and developing our fitness product lines. Shape leverages Motion Tracking to automatically track your workouts. It recognizes your specific exercise, counts reps, generates metrics, and logs when you rest. For example, if you’re doing jumping jacks when you should be doing push-ups. Shape knows. You’re not reaching up after your burpees. Shape knows. We’ve taken the best parts of the original Atlas Wristband exercise tracking and baked it into each and every Shape.</p>
<p><b>CoachAI </b>is our latest innovation that brings the knowledge and experience from hundreds of thousands of workouts to your wrist. Shape considers over a dozen metrics from Atlas Motion Tracking, including your form and personal bests, to find the ideal workout to help you reach your goals.</p>
<div data-id=""15430911""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1489680211/tzc8izqkslgkcpe8hsgr.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p>Previously, understanding these elements required professional training and expensive technology. CoachAI distills this information down to simple, actionable feedback and knowledge through real-time suggestions. “Slow down your reps to burn fat more effectively.” And strategic planning, “Let’s do a recovery workout tomorrow, looks like you were over-exerting yourself.”</p>
<p>We didn’t stop there – we’ve added 24/7 Tracking features as well. Along with Atlas Motion Tracking, Shape monitors your fitness and activity throughout the day, sleep patterns at night, and heart rate throughout the day to measure your daily caloric expenditure. For the first time ever a truly comprehensive fitness tracking system is made possible by Atlas Motion Tracking. </p>

<p>General Manager and Fitness Director Dennis Mathias spent 12 months developing the Atlas Weight Loss program. A 30 year veteran of the fitness industry he has seen or done it all and after 30 years has finally been able to prove that weight loss is nothing more than burning more calories than you eat. Using the original second generation Atlas Wristband 2, 3 to 5 times per week and following no nutrition guidelines or special supplements, Dennis was able to generate a 30 pound weight loss and a 5% drop in body fat when normal weight loss approaches would have generated no more than a 10 pound loss and a 2% body fat drop. Since then 20 members have enrolled in Dennis’ program and by following his program are recognizing the same dramatic results.</p>

Too hard? Too easy? Not enough time? Just let Shape know. Never again ask yourself “What should I do today?” Shape’s here to guide you. 
 

  


 

Follow and track HIIT workouts that require no equipment. Each custom workout is designed to keep your heart rate up, activating anaerobic fitness levels to maximize your daily caloric burn in quick, energetic workouts.



For our first release, we’ll focus on creating a complete experience focused for activities that require no equipment like running, burpees, and sit-ups. We want to get Shape right for this sport before we stretch our coverage into the entire Atlas library. In subsequent releases, we’ll expand Shape’s capabilities into more activities and fitness styles.
 

Since Atlas was founded, our community has completed over 1.3 million sets. From running to calisthenics, CoachAI's intelligence leverages our ever growing experience and knowledge to find what workouts and goals work best to help everyone achieve greatness.

But it doesn't stop there, collectively we've blown past plateaus and achieved over 100,000 personal bests through progressive training. Here, an actual Atlas member continuously achieves new personal bests using Atlas technology: 

Our library continues to grow as we learn more about exercise form and details within physiology never seen before. Each exercise added is backed by hundreds of personal training hours designed to help CoachAI identify and help our members continue to improve form, reduce chance of strain, and optimize efficiency. 
 

 


Atlas Motion Tracking is back. Our bleeding-edge machine learning system is built based on our experience studying human motion and developing our fitness product lines. Shape leverages Motion Tracking to automatically track your workouts. It recognizes your specific exercise, counts reps, generates metrics, and logs when you rest. For example, if you’re doing jumping jacks when you should be doing push-ups. Shape knows. You’re not reaching up after your burpees. Shape knows. We’ve taken the best parts of the original Atlas Wristband exercise tracking and baked it into each and every Shape.
CoachAI is our latest innovation that brings the knowledge and experience from hundreds of thousands of workouts to your wrist. Shape considers over a dozen metrics from Atlas Motion Tracking, including your form and personal bests, to find the ideal workout to help you reach your goals.

Previously, understanding these elements required professional training and expensive technology. CoachAI distills this information down to simple, actionable feedback and knowledge through real-time suggestions. “Slow down your reps to burn fat more effectively.” And strategic planning, “Let’s do a recovery workout tomorrow, looks like you were over-exerting yourself.”
We didn’t stop there – we’ve added 24/7 Tracking features as well. Along with Atlas Motion Tracking, Shape monitors your fitness and activity throughout the day, sleep patterns at night, and heart rate throughout the day to measure your daily caloric expenditure. For the first time ever a truly comprehensive fitness tracking system is made possible by Atlas Motion Tracking. 
 


 

Fitness is a way of life, and Shape fits the mold. It’s waterproof up to 1 meter, packs a bright display for indoor/outdoor use, and an accurate wrist-based heart-rate.

Shape was founded on a simple and clean aesthetic that packs the full power of Atlas Motion Tracking. Its ergonomic, curved design fits comfortably on your wrist and slides easily under long sleeved shirts.

Shape is so powerful you’ll want to wear it all week long. That’s why we made sure we gave it a battery that lasts up to 5 days. 

 

 



 

See every stat, goal, insight and more from the convenience of your computer. Shape is compatible with the entire Atlas Wristband ecosystem so you can dive deeper into every stat the drives the decisions of your new artificial intelligence Coach.





 

 

 

 

 

Update March 7: As we pass 150% of our goal we're proud to announce our newest workout partner, MadBarz. With workout plans, tutorials, targeted exercises all compatible with Atlas Shape, you can track your progress automatically as you complete your first 10 pull ups or do the Human Flag!

 

Update March 1: With all of your support, a new generation of fitness trackers was born. We blew past our goal and are wanted to reward the community with our first partner, Physiclo. Together with their expertise we've created a Heart Rate Efficiency Workout Program to help you get even more out of your workouts.

I have a pair of the original Physiclo Resistance pants and they will really get your heart rate going, so we wanted to share our excitement in their gear and a Physiclo paired workout to help you get the most out of every workout.

Here you can see how progressive resistance training can drastically increase your results. Here we follow a user from December 2016 to February 2017. You'll notice that the user can now achieve a Training Volume of 20,250 with an average HR of 89 and a max of 121 bpm. 3 months ago, it took the user a heart rate average of 98 and a max of 128 bpm for only 17,049. That's a 42% gain of Strength per Calorie Burned! 
Training with Physiclo can help you get similar results and even accelerate you to workout smarter. Every Atlas Shape member gets access to Physiclo's Progression workout for an enhanced training experience FREE. Not only that, but every member is gets 25% off with code ""ATLAS"". 

 

 

We have locked in our manufacturing partner. Received and approved our Initial production samples. We are ready to go and just need YOU to kick us off! We are confident with our ship date and have a track record of successfully inventing, developing, and shipping multiple hardware products.

  We use your mobile as biometric scanner and 3D printing technologies.The biometric scan allows us to get an accurate 3D model of your foot, wherever you are in just 10 minutes. 
  The 3D printing technology allows us to reduce costs and production time so we can pass these savings to you. No standard sized shoe fits your foot exactly.Why would you buy something that doesn’t perfectly fit your feet? As seen on:           You will be able to choose the add-ons at the end of the campaign, when we will send out the survey.  
 1) Download the appFirst you need to download the iOS or Android app on your mobile. We will send you the link to download the app at the end of the campagin. If you don't have a mobile (you can always ask a friend!) or don't want to experience the ""personal comfort"" you will still be able to choose your standard size. 2) Print the reference sheet (two A4 papers placed side by side or one A3 paper) that we will send you via email at the end of the campaign.3) Take at least 15 pictures of each foot individually. 4) Choose your color!After the campaign, we will send you an email to let you choose your favorite color from the following:       Any irregularities are natural attributes of the leather and should be considered as characteristics of the product.    Over the last year we have been testing with hundreds of people, we have received a ton of great feedback, listened to our customers and made multiple improvements since then!Recent advances in biometric scanning and 3D printing technologies make this the perfect time for our innovation.We need your help to make it real. Hit one of the below buttons and show iovado to your friends.       iovado embraces cost transparency so that our customers limpidly know what they are paying for and can make purchases in full awareness.By being online only, iovado eliminates brick-and-mortar expenses and passes these savings on to customers.Everything we do we believe in the importance of a high degree of manual skills in the production of high-quality goods; we believe more attention should be given to the artisans who are the backbone of iovado’s quality. The way we give more attention to the artisans is by being transparent and revealing our costs.   Once the last gets in the hands of the Italian craftsmen... We use ""sacchetto bolognese construction"" method which is rooted in Italian tradition and allows each shoe to fit like a glove.What characterizes iovado shoe is the quality of the leather. We use premium calf leather, selecting only first choice with a specific thickness:each pair of iovado Mocassino shoes is crafted, dyed, and burnished by hand.  The soles express Italian exclusivity: each sole is brushed vintage and hand-polished; therefore each sole differs from one another.iovado shoes are handmade and packaged at the craftsmen’s workshops in Italy in the Marche region paying utmost attention to quality and design.Each pair goes through a rigorous inspection to ensure that every shoe is of the highest quality.     iovado has been conceived from the idea of two Italian brothers Albert and Hans Paul to create an unique and timeless moccasin shoe with strong lines and very comfortable. The quality of our shoes is centred around three pillars: design, comfort and custom made. The young entrepreneurs were born in Valdagno in the cradle of Marzotto a famous Italian textile industry; therefore, the bond with the fashion industry was inevitable.Our vision is to bring breakthrough technologies to the traditional high fashion industry to make luxury goods affordable to everyone.It all started 3 years ago, we were studying and working abroad and as fashion-minded people we were disappointed of seeing the same premium luxury shoe brands everywhere.So we came back to Italy with a draw and an idea.As former MSc students of Innovation and Technology at Bocconi University in Milan, we had the idea of ​​using Biometric scanning and 3D printing technologies to create a unique, custom-made shoe.We built several prototypes, we researched into the craftsmanship of shoes, talked to several artisans, exchanging ideas, getting feedbacks, breaking old bias and getting lost through the beautiful Italy.We invested a lot of time talking to our beta users and improving our product. A lot of ups and downs, learnings and iterations.And we are here now to introduce iovado to the world.  iovado loafer is a must-have, timeless shoe that fits several styles. Whether for the office, a business dinner, a party, or simply a casual weekend look. Plain and simple, available in a wide array of colors: from the classic brown leather to the light-blue Santorini, we have stylish colors that suit several occasions.                       iovado shoes are characterized by dotted lines that represent the path made of steps into the future.The dotted lines express action, progress and your next step.We believe that action beats inaction. iovado shoe was born to embrace this concept while giving personality to who wears it.  Feel empowered to take new steps and let the dotted lines give you balance and drive for your next decisions.We are the result of the steps we took in the past, and of the decisions that we take everyday. iovado shoes are all about inspiration. Let the dotted line find that inspiration in you, whilst empowering your next steps.  At the end of the campaign, we will send the link to download the app and the survey to collect your color choices.The faster we get them back, the sooner we can start production!We expect that it will take 3 to 4 weeks to collect these information from you.As soon as we get your information, we will put your shoes into production.Production typically takes 4 weeks, and shipping approximately 2 to 3 days (we use DHL Express).By the end of September 2017, you will receive your custom-made italian handcrafted mocassino shoes!We ship worldwide. Once your iovado shoes have been shipped we will send you the tracking code.The shipping cost will be charged at the time of the survey once the campaign is over and will vary based on the destination country. You can see shipping rates here.If applicable, duties and local taxes will be charged by the appropriate authority at the destination country.

<h3>Why Resinate?</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Leitha, and I am the founder and creator of Resinate Jewelry that combines bullet casings with natural stones to create works of beauty. I began Resinate in 2014 to share my passion for creating unique, handcrafted statement pieces with others. My life's journey, like so many others, has not been easy, but it led me to creating my own business where I hope to help others find their own voice. <i><strong>I believe individuality is important and should be celebrated. I create my jewelry to reflect that belief.</strong></i></p>
<p>I just received the amazing news that I was selected to participate in the Las Vegas Cowboy Christmas from December 7-16, 2017. This is a huge achievement for me and my business, and I couldn't be happier for this incredible chance to be seen by thousands of new potential buyers. <i><strong>The exposure from this event could be the making of my small startup!​ But, I need your help to make this event happen.</strong></i></p>
<p>In order to raise money for the booth fee, I have removed all items from my online storefront and put them here on my Indiegogo campaign. This is not only a great opportunity for you to help me grow my business, but a perfect chance to purchase some my one-of-a-kind statement pieces at a great price! I need your help to celebrate the unique spark in every human - help me grow Resinate!</p>
<p><i><strong>Thank you for your support! I couldn't do this without you.</strong></i></p>
<p>P.S. Since my jewelry contains bullet casings, I cannot ship internationally at this time. Thank you for your understanding.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The combined cost for my booth fee, travel and hotel stay for the week in Las Vegas, and creating new jewelry for the show is $5,000. Unfortunately, these incredible works of art don't grow on trees!</p>
<p>As my gift to you for your support, I'll be sending you one of my handcrafted pieces of jewelry! Each level of giving is broken down with what is included with your contribution. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>No two pieces are the same, so you are guaranteed a one-of-a-kind masterpiece created with love to celebrate that unique spark in you!</strong></i></p>
<p>Please note that since each piece is unique and different, I couldn't possibly list each one separately. Only custom orders will be able to design or choose the specific item that will be shipped to them. Don't worry, every piece I create is stunning - you won't be disappointed!</p>
<p>If by some unfortunate circumstance the Cowboy Christmas event doesn't work out, your generosity will still help Resinate continue to grow and reach even new heights as I begin work on my bridal and men's line. Change is constant, and so are the pieces I create at Resinate!</p>

<h3>What You're Support Really Means</h3>
<p>Every person has a moment in their life where they stand at the crossroads and need to make a choice. For me, I chose independence and the freedom to live my life for me. I created Resinate Jewelry so I could enjoy all that life had to offer me while doing what I love. While I love creating these incredible, wearable works of art, I am still working additional jobs to make ends meet. </p>
<p>Your support not only helps me get to the 2017 Las Vegas Cowboy Christmas, it gives me a new lease on life and my business. This is the spark I need to grow my business so I can help others find independence through Resinate Jewelry as well, as a patron or employee. <strong><i>The spark is there!

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I recognize the cost of attending the 2017 Las Vegas Cowboy Christmas is rather steep, and I have a lot of long days and late nights ahead of me as I prepare my displays and stunning new pieces for this show.

<p>If the worst should happen and I don't make it to the event, I am not giving up! My passion is in Resinate and the freedom it can provide.

<p>STRAPO™ is designed in New York, USA. We are a small team, committed to designing unique &amp; innovative products that offer irresistible value to our customers. By pooling in the best talents and with a wealth of experience, we came up with Strapo Minimalist Wallet.</p>
<p>Traditional wallets were geared towards carrying cash, eventually adopting card pockets as a secondary feature, but in today’s day and age, that design has become bulky and unnecessary. Credit, Debit, and Gift Cards are quickly becoming the standard, and when you’re in line at the supermarket, it’s all about the ease of the swipe-and-go. Most slim wallets, while solving the bulky issue, end up compromising on the ability to carry more when needed. We sought to do was create the perfect middle ground – a wallet that was spacious without taking up too much space, but most importantly, was geared towards card-carrying, and convenience.</p></figure></div><div data-id=""18619833""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1510245215/otzbm8z32qokeqohji6w.png"" src=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><p><b>Expandable Strap</b> – expands according to all that you put into the wallet and holds it tight.

We are a small team, committed to designing unique & innovative products that offer irresistible value to our customers. By pooling in the best talents and with a wealth of experience, we came up with Strapo Minimalist Wallet.
Traditional wallets were geared towards carrying cash, eventually adopting card pockets as a secondary feature, but in today’s day and age, that design has become bulky and unnecessary. Credit, Debit, and Gift Cards are quickly becoming the standard, and when you’re in line at the supermarket, it’s all about the ease of the swipe-and-go. Most slim wallets, while solving the bulky issue, end up compromising on the ability to carry more when needed. We sought to do was create the perfect middle ground – a wallet that was spacious without taking up too much space, but most importantly, was geared towards card-carrying, and convenience. Expandable Strap – expands according to all that you put into the wallet and holds it tight. You can therefore confidently fit in any item like GPS tracker, keys, Earphone, Receipts, business cards, cash, memory cards. It simply fits in all that you need and holds it tight and you don't have to worry about losing any item.  Smart Pull-out Strap – Quickly access your multiple cards up to 6 cards. The elastic strap holds your items firmly, and will automatically retract once released. This layer insulates your cards and prevents electronic pick-pocketing called RFID skimming. The padding secures all the cards in your inner compartment.  Two quick access slots: on one side which gives easy access to your favorite card. This slot is an RFID protection free slot is open for your work ID card, so you can seamlessly and easily access it on the go. Easy-access Push Slot – Convex opening makes it easier to push your card out              HOW WE CREATED STRAPO

when we set out to create a wallet that would simplify our lives.  We launched our first design on Kickstarter and thanks to the overwhelming support, we were successfully funded.  We fulfilled over 3,000 orders and since then have received feedback and suggestions for a better wallet.  Taking them into consideration we have come up with something truly unique and one of a kind.  </p><p>We wanted a wallet that was convenient to use, looked great, and was thin at the same time.  Money clips are a one solution to keeping it thin, but we found it very inconvenient folding your bills to put them away.  The standard bill-folds we found on the market were either too bulky, too cheap looking, or way over priced.  The Articulate Wallet 2.0 gives you everything you look for in the perfect wallet.  An ultra-thin minimalist design, convenient to use, and all at a very affordable price.</p><p><img class=""lazy""

we offer TEN great looking wallets, we wanted to give our Indiegogo supporters the opportunity to make this wallet their own.  Whether it's your favorite sports team's colors, patriotic colors, company colors, school colors etc., we wanted our supporters to have that choice.  Mix n' Match any of the leather colors we offer in the 2.0 collection, along with any stitching color.  </p><img

care?</h1><p>Whether its your debit/credit card or you government issued ID or driver's license, these cards now include RF(radio frequency) enabled chips.  When these chips come into contact with

Seamless, refined build quality. The edges of the wallet now wrap inside of the wallet. This makes for a professional, higher quality wallet.  
The lining on the back pocket wraps over itself. We added a special RFID blocking lining. You can now feel secure that all your personal information, including the card in the back pocket, are protected from RFID identity theft.   Other RFID blocking wallets on the market are boring/bulky and have nothing unique about them.   We widened the wallet by 1/4in to hold your bills more easily. The ability to fully customize at a very affordable price- $55Articulate Wallet 2.0 CollectionThe Story-Articulate began just over a year ago, when we set out to create a wallet that would simplify our lives.  We launched our first design on Kickstarter and thanks to the overwhelming support, we were successfully funded.  We fulfilled over 3,000 orders and since then have received feedback and suggestions for a better wallet.  Taking them into consideration we have come up with something truly unique and one of a kind.  We wanted a wallet that was convenient to use, looked great, and was thin at the same time.  Money clips are a one solution to keeping it thin, but we found it very inconvenient folding your bills to put them away.  The standard bill-folds we found on the market were either too bulky, too cheap looking, or way over priced.  The Articulate Wallet 2.0 gives you everything you look for in the perfect wallet.  An ultra-thin minimalist design, convenient to use, and all at a very affordable price.Customize Your Articulate Although we offer TEN great looking wallets, we wanted to give our Indiegogo supporters the opportunity to make this wallet their own.  Whether it's your favorite sports team's colors, patriotic colors, company colors, school colors etc., we wanted our supporters to have that choice.  Mix n' Match any of the leather colors we offer in the 2.0 collection, along with any stitching color.  What is RFID and why should I care?Whether its your debit/credit card or you government issued ID or driver's license, these cards now include RF(radio frequency) enabled chips.  When these chips come into contact with radio waves, they respond with a slightly altered signal.

<p>From time

independence and prosperity. And after all these years, I would like to reveal

supported me and stayed by my side.</p>

<p>Hi, we are Dom and Luke. The story of why we decided to design the Invisible bags is simple - we don't like the way the fashion industry operates. In recent years, fashion has been spewing out trends faster than we can buy. This is an era defined by disposability and noise, and put simply, we had enough. </p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: initial;"">We believe that with the right design, fashion doesn't need to be temporary or disposable. One well-considered object can take the place of many cheaply made ones. And that's exactly how we designed the Invisible bags. </span></p><div>

Hi, we are Dom and Luke. The story of why we decided to design the Invisible bags is simple - we don't like the way the fashion industry operates. In recent years, fashion has been spewing out trends faster than we can buy. This is an era defined by disposability and noise, and put simply, we had enough. We believe that with the right design, fashion doesn't need to be temporary or disposable. One well-considered object can take the place of many cheaply made ones. And that's exactly how we designed the Invisible bags. 
Our short video about fast fashion:



Invisible bags:
- Simple
- Functional
- Long-lasting

While style can change
quickly, a well-considered design will remain. We
believe that a bag that can withstand the test of time, and one you will want to use forever must start with this: 
1. A simple and unobtrusive appearance

Changing a t-shirt
for a shirt can often result in us changing our bag as well. But a great design
shouldn't restrict us from self-expression. Your personal style can be anywhere
from bohemian to preppy, but it shouldn't matter for a well-designed bag.
2. Useful and honest functionality
A bag is bought to be used (well,
like duh). Therefore, its design needs to include functionality that will help
and encourage us to use it. But this is a dangerous place
where many get lost - adding geeky features that promise the world, but end up
getting in the way. Honest design requires patience, lots of it. And making something simple feel complete, even more. 

We want you to use your bag everyday. That's why all bags feature a water resistant exterior. Rain will always be part of our lives and a well-designed bag needs to take that into account

We want you to use your bag forever. That's why all bags are made from a strong and durable materials. The shell is made from 800D nylon and the details are PVC*.
*Not the most environmentally friendly material. But because it will last longer than some other materials and you won't need to buy a new bag because of it, we believe it's a good trade-off.  ""Fun"" fact - even though cotton comes from mother earth, the large quantities consumed by the fashion world  has made it by far the biggest pollutant in the industry.
3. A sustainable mindset
A timeless design,
unlike a fashionable one, will never seem outdated. By increasing the
lifecycle of a product we start to conserve not only the earth's resources but
also our own - the time and money spent on cheap disposable products that try to be fashionable might seem
insignificant in the short term, but has proven to be huge in the long run. And
to better illustrate that, we made up some numbers:Less, but betterFind out more about the features of individual bags below:

THE CODE
Sometimes you can get lost when trying to reach a certain destination. That's why having a compass that helps guide you to the right direction is very important. The compass we use can be found below. The ten principles that were developed by Dieter Rams is what we are all about.

WHAT IS GOOD DESIGN?
It's as little design as possible:
Less, but better – because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with non-essentials. Back to purity, back to simplicity






It's innovative:
The possibilities for innovation are not, by any means, exhausted. Technological development is always offering new opportunities for innovative design. But innovative design always develops in tandem with innovative technology, and can never be an end in itself.




It's unobtrusive:
Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither decorative objects nor works of art. Their design should therefore be both neutral and restrained, to leave room for the user’s self-expression.






It makes a product useful:
A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy certain criteria, not only functional but also psychological and aesthetic. Good design emphasizes the usefulness of a product while disregarding anything that could possibly detract from it.




It's honest:
It does not make a product more innovative, powerful or valuable than it really is. It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer with promises that cannot be kept






It's aesthetic:
The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness because products are used every day and have an effect on people and their well-being. Only well-executed objects can be beautiful.




It's long-lasting:
It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated. Unlike fashionable design, it lasts many years – even in today’s throwaway society.






It makes a product understandable:
It clarifies the product’s structure. Better still, it can make the product clearly express its function by making use of the user’s intuition. At best, it is self-explanatory.




It's thorough down to the last detail:
Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in the design process show respect towards the consumer.






It's environmentally friendly:
Design makes an important contribution to the preservation of the environment. It conserves resources and minimises physical and visual pollution throughout the lifecycle of the product.",43.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p><strong><em>My whole life I have been fascinated with anything that flies. Our website: <a href=""http://www.wickedwingflyingthing.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.wickedwingflyingthing.com</a> </em></strong></p>
<p>The Wicked Wing Flying Thing™, made to rule over the wind for outdoor sports. ""Wicked"" means going beyond reasonable limits.</p>
<p>The Wicked Wing Flying Thing ™ is an exciting new flying disc featuring a wickedly unique aerodynamic design that enables it to perform in superior ways when compared to other flying discs. We have a new design which raises the bar on flight performance. We field tested each aspect of the design to confirm our findings and created something very special and well worth fresh attention. We hope you will be intrigued and become part of the Wicked Wing Flying Thing's™ next stage, scale up to commercial manufacturing and first production run.</p>
<p>The idea came about from wondering if there is a way to compete in the  <a href=""http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.guinnessworldrecords.com</a>  flight distance record established for hand held throwing objects. Development was remarkably fun and quite different than what we expected. Testing the prototypes has delighted friends, neighbors and casual witnesses that have seen the Wicked Wing Flying Thing™ in action. In the midst of our testing we realized that the need to fly beyond 100 yards is unnecessary. This product exhibits accuracy, force, and the convenience of staying on target in the wind. Wind does not have adverse effects on accuracy. The design exhibits far greater qualities than just achieving longer distances. The initial discovery of wing capability gave us the luxury to focus on the most practical weight, dimensions and most importantly, the specific wing shape details. The shape of the wings is the root of the Wicked Wing Flying Thing's™ lift and gracefulness in flight. This unique flying thing will be made with silicone rubber for a soft, bendable outer edge safe to catch by hand.</p>
<p>In this section we will show a comparison of the Wicked Wing Flying Thing™ capabilities to other flying discs:</p>

The timepiece features a larger face unisex design with minimal non numerical markers which won’t deter from the beauty of the artwork and finishings. Encased in stainless steel 3ATM/30m resistant and built to the highest quality, matched with a genuine leather vintage strap with a light suede finish. Accuracy is ensured by Japanese 3 hand movement and each timepiece comes with a 1 year manufacturer's warranty.

<p><span>I created <strong>CanGenie</strong> because my wife complained about filthy, disgusting trash bags at the bottom of the can (think last night's spaghetti + full baby diaper).  Yeah!  For some reason neither my wife nor my daughters wanted to reach in there and reattach the bag to the rim.  That was apparently my job and frankly, I didn't want to do it either.  So off to the garage I went with an idea on how to solve this problem.  Two hair dryers later (I set the first one on fire), some wire, batteries and an ordinary trash can and POOF, the <strong>CanGenie</strong> was born. </span></p>

It's a highly renewable resource that doesn't require pesticides or fungicides to be grown, which is great for the environment. Bamboo actually exchanges the carbon dioxide in the air 30x more efficient than trees. With impressive facts like that, it's no wonder we're excited to showcase Bamboo to the world!Our industry goal is to help raise awareness of the harmful effects of the modern cotton industry today which uses 100's of thousands of tons of chemicals to grow and maintain each year, where Bamboo does not need any chemicals to grow. That's right! Bamboo plants have 100% natural strength and raw power, just like you and us.  We see a sustainable world made of Bamboo clothing instead.Of course, the most amazing thing about this giant woody-grass is that it can be worn as clothing and is compared to the softness of cashmere or silk. Our Bamboo clothing material are just as impressive as the plant itself.RISKS AND CHALLENGES1. We already have a pre-production run of socks being made, worn and tested, and our production team is ready to produce your orders as soon as funding is received.2. We have been researching, developing and testing Bamboo product in the market for the past several years. People are blown away with the feel and confort of our product. We anticipate our production to go smoothly with a prompt and easy delivery once the project is funded and the first run of socks are made.3. Delays are unforeseen and obstacles are always possible. We find the likelihood of anything serious occurring to be extremely unlikely. That said, our community of supporters will be the first to know if anything unexpected happens.",4.0,0,"5 Campaigns

<h2>THE MIRROR IN THE SKY STORY</h2>
<p></p>
<p>We love handmade scarves and we love creating amazing designs... put the two  together and you have Mirror in the Sky. <br/></p>
<p>Our story begins in the Nepal Himalaya mountains where we discovered a tradition of handweaving cashmere that is more than 400 years old. We are based in Barcelona, a beautiful vibrant city full of style and for the last three years we've learnt how to make great scarves. At the same time, we've searched for a way to combine our passion for art, design and photography to create a unique range of 'Signature Designs'.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1382262/files/20150414081828-Top_of_Page_2_copy.jpg?1429024708"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>Designer scarves are normally very expensive and that doesn't make sense to us. Our mission is to promote new and emerging artists, designers and photographers through a sustainable business model for high quality handmade products. We have decided to focus on selling our products online, so that we can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid the huge markups of retailers and distributors</li>
<li>Guarantee Fair Wages to our weavers and artists</li>
<li>Offer you amazing value for money</li>
</ul>
<p>So we've come to Indiegogo because we need to meet minimum quantities for each design. We'd really appreciate your help to make this project a reality and reach our fundraising goal of €12,000 (US$13,000) and make all of our Signature Designs!</p>

<h2>EARTHQUAKE DISASTER UPDATE</h2>
<p>The launch of our Indiegogo Campaign has coincided with a massive earthquake in Nepal. Tragically one staff member lost their life and the factory has been partially damaged but we are thankful because the situation could have been much worse.  <br/></p>
<p>Over the last twenty years Nepal has been a huge part of our lives, it is our second home, so <b>we will be donating 10% of all sales to the disaster relief program</b>.</p>
<p>We will be supporting PHASE Nepal (<a href=""http://www.phasenepal.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.phasenepal.org</a>) a humanitarian NGO based in Nepal who are coordinating relief supplies throughout the country.<br/></p>
<p>The disaster relief program is just the beginning of the help that Nepal needs now and in the future. We think that the best way to help Nepal fully recover is by combining emergency aid with long-term business partnerships so we believe our project has become more important than ever. <br/></p>
<p>The Fair Wages we pay are a vital lifeline for more than 100 families. We are already repairing the factory and expect to be operational in the next two to three weeks.<br/></p>
<p><b>We are totally committed to continue working in Nepal in the years ahead.</b><br/></p>
<p>Please support our project by choosing a perk and sharing our story.<br/></p>
<p></p>

</p>
<p>When you begin with amazing fibers you can make amazing scarves. We have chosen a 'modal-cashmere' blended yarn because it is totally natural and feels sensational. Modal comes from beech trees and cashmere is from mountain goats in the Himalaya and Mongolia.</p>
<p>We make everything in Nepal by hand, from preparing the yarn, weaving, massaging and finishing each scarf because we believe it is the best way to make amazing products.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1371801/files/20150410090022-LOOM_1.jpg?1428681622"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>SIGNATURE DESIGNS</b>
</p>
<p>The idea of wearable art really appeals to us, so we have partnered with artists, designers and photographers to create what we call 'Signature Designs' - to transform our scarf canvas in to products that say or express something about who we are and the world we live in.</p>
<p>We want to encourage more artists and designers to get involved with 
our project, so please feel free to 
contact us with ideas!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1372057/files/20150410101236-Creative_Design_IMG_4294_small.jpg?1428685956"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>FAIR WAGES</b>
</p>
<p>Designer scarves typically cost €270 - €1000 (US$300 - $1100) due to 
high margins charged by distributors and retailers but we want to make 
our products affordable to everyone and pay <a href=""http://www.fair-wage.com/en/fair-wage-approach-menu/definition-of-fair-wages.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fair Wages</a> to the 
folks who make them. <br/></p>
<p>We believe that producing high-value handmade items is the most sustainable way of building a strong business in Nepal. Our project is designed to improve the livelihoods of all the staff in Nepal as well as the artists and designers who create our designs. <br/></p>
<p>It has taken us two years to put together the right
 combination of yarn suppliers, weavers, designers and artists to test our sustainable business model but we must also be competitive. So, instead of cutting wages to save costs, we have decided to cut out the middle men and retailers and sell direct online.</p>

<p><b>SOMETHING LUCKY FOR EVERYONE</b>
</p>
<p>Plus, every product comes with a Kalachakra amulet that has been 
blessed by a Tibetan Lama. It's a symbol of tolerance, wisdom and 
openness from the Himalaya and represents our ethical, open approach to 
business. <br/></p>
<p>We recommend you put it on your key ring and you'll never 
loose your keys again ;-)<br/></p>

AMAZING AND THANK YOU!!!!

A huge and sincerest thank you to all of our contributors! Your generosity is inspiring and you have helped us to do something very special... 10% of all contributions have been transferred to Phase Nepal to help earthquake relief.
If you have any questions about your products, or you are interested in what is happening at Mirror in the Sky, please email us:

THE MIRROR IN THE SKY STORY

We love handmade scarves and we love creating amazing designs... put the two  together and you have Mirror in the Sky. 
Our story begins in the Nepal Himalaya mountains where we discovered a tradition of handweaving cashmere that is more than 400 years old. We are based in Barcelona, a beautiful vibrant city full of style and for the last three years we've learnt how to make great scarves. At the same time, we've searched for a way to combine our passion for art, design and photography to create a unique range of 'Signature Designs'.





Designer scarves are normally very expensive and that doesn't make sense to us. Our mission is to promote new and emerging artists, designers and photographers through a sustainable business model for high quality handmade products. We have decided to focus on selling our products online, so that we can:

Avoid the huge markups of retailers and distributors
Guarantee Fair Wages to our weavers and artists
Offer you amazing value for money

So we've come to Indiegogo because we need to meet minimum quantities for each design. We'd really appreciate your help to make this project a reality and reach our fundraising goal of €12,000 (US$13,000) and make all of our Signature Designs!








EARTHQUAKE DISASTER UPDATE
The launch of our Indiegogo Campaign has coincided with a massive earthquake in Nepal. Tragically one staff member lost their life and the factory has been partially damaged but we are thankful because the situation could have been much worse.  
Over the last twenty years Nepal has been a huge part of our lives, it is our second home, so we will be donating 10% of all sales to the disaster relief program.
We will be supporting PHASE Nepal (www.phasenepal.org) a humanitarian NGO based in Nepal who are coordinating relief supplies throughout the country.
The disaster relief program is just the beginning of the help that Nepal needs now and in the future. We think that the best way to help Nepal fully recover is by combining emergency aid with long-term business partnerships so we believe our project has become more important than ever. 
The Fair Wages we pay are a vital lifeline for more than 100 families. We are already repairing the factory and expect to be operational in the next two to three weeks.
We are totally committed to continue working in Nepal in the years ahead.
Please support our project by choosing a perk and sharing our story.



HANDCRAFTED

When you begin with amazing fibers you can make amazing scarves. We have chosen a 'modal-cashmere' blended yarn because it is totally natural and feels sensational. Modal comes from beech trees and cashmere is from mountain goats in the Himalaya and Mongolia.
We make everything in Nepal by hand, from preparing the yarn, weaving, massaging and finishing each scarf because we believe it is the best way to make amazing products.



SIGNATURE DESIGNS

The idea of wearable art really appeals to us, so we have partnered with artists, designers and photographers to create what we call 'Signature Designs' - to transform our scarf canvas in to products that say or express something about who we are and the world we live in.
We want to encourage more artists and designers to get involved with 
our project, so please feel free to 
contact us with ideas!



FAIR WAGES

Designer scarves typically cost €270 - €1000 (US$300 - $1100) due to 
high margins charged by distributors and retailers but we want to make 
our products affordable to everyone and pay Fair Wages to the 
folks who make them. 
We believe that producing high-value handmade items is the most sustainable way of building a strong business in Nepal. Our project is designed to improve the livelihoods of all the staff in Nepal as well as the artists and designers who create our designs. 
It has taken us two years to put together the right
 combination of yarn suppliers, weavers, designers and artists to test our sustainable business model but we must also be competitive. So, instead of cutting wages to save costs, we have decided to cut out the middle men and retailers and sell direct online.



SOMETHING LUCKY FOR EVERYONE

Plus, every product comes with a Kalachakra amulet that has been 
blessed by a Tibetan Lama. It's a symbol of tolerance, wisdom and 
openness from the Himalaya and represents our ethical, open approach to 
business. 
We recommend you put it on your key ring and you'll never 
loose your keys again ;-)

<p>Hi everyone, I am ridiculously excited to have been accepted to present my first fashion line at Vancouver’s Winter Fashion Week in March. I've immersed myself in the creative process but I'm urgently seeking funding to complete and bring my show fully to life. Not only will you help me achieve a LIFELONG DREAM, but you will also nourish the fledgling local art and fashion community in our city. XOX</p>
<h2>1. Dandi's Life and Work</h2>
<p>From an early age, I've sought to understand who I am, what my spirit holds and what my obligation to the universe is.... Everything I've done since has tied back to my earliest experiences, growing up in northern BC. Gazing at the skies (aurora borealis, constellations) and vast mountain ranges, I yearned to see what was beyond them. It's natural that my subsequent life and work has been an exploration of the elements, the earth, my subconscious, hypnagogia (the state between sleep and awake), and the human condition.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1150.photobucket.com/albums/o604/primitive_love/2up-01.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><small style=""display: block; text-align: right;"">Photos Credit: Camille Mcquat / Leigh Righton</small></p>

<p>Although I came to some degree of prominence via the musical acts Dandi Wind and Fan Death, my efforts have been more than just sound based. I've always considered myself to be an art director; a mode honed by my experiences touring globally, performing in prestigious art spaces, working in film, video, costume, and styling, both for myself and clients. The transition into a focus on fashion/styling was natural and organic, and enabled me to present a very successful first show in December 2012 for USED House of Vintage in Vancouver. Read <a href=""http://www.straight.com/life/dandilion-wind-opaine"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the review of the show in The Straight</a> and see <a href=""http://www.lyndsaygreenwood.ca/2012/12/launch_party/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">behind the scenes photos</a>.</p>
<h2>2. Vision for the show MARCH FASHION WEEK</h2>
<p>I’m extremely excited to present my winter line at Vancouver's Fashion Week in March 2013, a dream come true since adolescence.  I've been working on this collection of sculptural-wearable pieces for the past few months drawing upon my lifelong influences: My upbringing in Northern BC, between the tiny town of Smithers and the Wet'suwet'en First Nations village of Moricetown, in a cabin surrounded by lush evergreen forest and glaciers. My young and extremely loving hip parents, and WWII veteran grandparents taught me the appreciation of the earth’s natural resources and elements for survival. <br/><br/>My grandmother, a most remarkable woman, just passed away this month Feb 2013. As a child she had a great influence on me. She taught me to knit,  (she obsessively knit Chowichan sweaters for a period)  to shumak, to spot/collect gemstones/crystals and to appreciate skulls and bones washed up in her creek. I feel very blessed to have had her in my life and as a tribute to her I will incorporate many of her handknits, weave/cross stitch/ crochet and miniatures in this show.<br/><br/>Given enough resources, my show will present a new line of clothing in a fully immersive environment (with the production expertise of MIRROR whom I worked with on my Dec show) including performance, original musical score, and sculptural elements. It will help propel Vancouver further into the international fashion spotlight, while simultaneously employing extraordinarily talented local individuals in the fields of hair, makeup, sculpture, set design, video, and production. This is increasingly important, given the current climate of stifling of the arts by our federal government, and “bulldozing” of our city's cultural nodes by rampant and short sighted development (RIP Waldorf).</p>

<h2>3. Logistics</h2>
<p>The reality of my vision is two fold: I want to create and I want to present my creations.</p>
<p>In the process of my creation for this show, I will maximize the use of recycled/discarded organic fabrics and vintage items, including silk, cotton, and wool; hand dyed fabrics using ecologically friendly dyes. The accessories and handpieces will be entirely hand made.</p>
<p>In addition to a runway show, I wish to present my creations via pattern samples, a website, and print material. I will strive to achieve the caliber worthy of NYC, Paris, London :)</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1150.photobucket.com/albums/o604/primitive_love/dandi-33.jpeg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><small style=""display: block; text-align: right;"">Photo Credit: Camille McQuat</small></p>
<h3>Your funding will assist with the following essentials:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fabrics</li>
<li>Seamstresses</li>
<li>Pattern development</li>
<li>Screen-printing</li>
<li>Footwear</li>
<li>Handmade accessories</li>
<li>Studio space + walk in freezer</li>
<li>Fabric dyes</li>
<li>Video production for background screen</li>
<li>Live cinematographers</li>
<li>Marketing (website development, invitations, program printing,</li>
<li>Key Hair “sculptor/artist”&gt;</li>
<li>Hair extensions /Wigs</li>
<li>Key makeup artists</li>
<li>Music production, score specifically made for show</li>
<li>Accessories and headdresses</li>
<li>Props for show</li>
<li>Special rentals for show (snow machine, freezer truck)</li>
<li>Production assistant</li>
</ul><p>Thank you so much for taking a look at my pitch! Creating clothing can cost an enormous amount, and so can an ambitious showcase. Although I've managed to keep my costs down by recycling and reusing as much as possible and being as resourceful as I can, I still need your help to complete my work and present it with Mirror at VFW 2013.</p>

Although I came to some degree of prominence via the musical acts Dandi Wind and Fan Death, my efforts have been more than just sound based. I've always considered myself to be an art director; a mode honed by my experiences touring globally, performing in prestigious art spaces, working in film, video, costume, and styling, both for myself and clients. The transition into a focus on fashion/styling was natural and organic, and enabled me to present a very successful first show in December 2012 for USED House of Vintage in Vancouver. Read the review of the show in The Straight and see behind the scenes photos.
2. Vision for the show MARCH FASHION WEEK
I’m extremely excited to present my winter line at Vancouver's Fashion Week in March 2013, a dream come true since adolescence.  I've been working on this collection of sculptural-wearable pieces for the past few months drawing upon my lifelong influences: My upbringing in Northern BC, between the tiny town of Smithers and the Wet'suwet'en First Nations village of Moricetown, in a cabin surrounded by lush evergreen forest and glaciers. My young and extremely loving hip parents, and WWII veteran grandparents taught me the appreciation of the earth’s natural resources and elements for survival. My grandmother, a most remarkable woman, just passed away this month Feb 2013. As a child she had a great influence on me. She taught me to knit,  (she obsessively knit Chowichan sweaters for a period)  to shumak, to spot/collect gemstones/crystals and to appreciate skulls and bones washed up in her creek. I feel very blessed to have had her in my life and as a tribute to her I will incorporate many of her handknits, weave/cross stitch/ crochet and miniatures in this show.Given enough resources, my show will present a new line of clothing in a fully immersive environment (with the production expertise of MIRROR whom I worked with on my Dec show) including performance, original musical score, and sculptural elements. It will help propel Vancouver further into the international fashion spotlight, while simultaneously employing extraordinarily talented local individuals in the fields of hair, makeup, sculpture, set design, video, and production. This is increasingly important, given the current climate of stifling of the arts by our federal government, and “bulldozing” of our city's cultural nodes by rampant and short sighted development (RIP Waldorf).

3. Logistics
The reality of my vision is two fold: I want to create and I want to present my creations.
In the process of my creation for this show, I will maximize the use of recycled/discarded organic fabrics and vintage items, including silk, cotton, and wool; hand dyed fabrics using ecologically friendly dyes. The accessories and handpieces will be entirely hand made.
In addition to a runway show, I wish to present my creations via pattern samples, a website, and print material. I will strive to achieve the caliber worthy of NYC, Paris, London :)

Thank you so much for taking a look at my pitch! Creating clothing can cost an enormous amount, and so can an ambitious showcase. Although I've managed to keep my costs down by recycling and reusing as much as possible and being as resourceful as I can, I still need your help to complete my work and present it with Mirror at VFW 2013.

</div></div>","My name is Rebecca Mink (AKA Granola Blahnik)I live for making luxury vegan shoes! I am based in Venice Beach, California.I have spent the last 15 years making shoes in Italy. Mink is produced in the same factories as Christain Louboutin, Chanel, Jimmy choo and more. All hand made by 4th generation shoe masters. Mink is the best vegan shoe in the world!We make vegan shoes that don't look like vegan shoes! We have built strong bonds with the top factories known for producing the most elite shoe brands. We are focused on creating the highest quality, sustainable, fashionable and comfortable vegan shoes available today.                    This is my partner Luca Villani (AKA Italian master)Luca lives for making a shoe come to life! He is based in Florence, Italy.Luca and I met over 7 years ago when I was on my last night in Florence after visiting the factories. We had a great creative and strong connection. I knew he was something very special. I asked him to be my translator on my next visit. Upon my return we reunited. We walked into the first factory of the day that produces Christian Louboutin and Luca came to life. It is then I realized Luca had worked in the fashion industry around Florence for over 20 years and was a master shoemaker himself. The rest is Mink history. THE STORY:We are resourceful survivors! We wanted to put every penny we made back in our company.  My partner Luca Villani designed his first full collection and worked on custom production in ITALY while I worked diligently on expanding and growing the company in the VENICE BEACH this season.The results are here to see. A gorgeous collection for Spring ONE 2016 offered to you at an affordable price direct from the factories in Italy.         WHY INDIEGOGO?:We have completed a successful campaign before to benefit Mercy For Animals (we LUV them!!) and we enjoyed promoting animal welfare and connecting people to the cause and why we do this. We received fabulous support from the vegan community!We really like the Indiegogo model because it helps our community share. There are people all around this planet that want quality vegan shoes. We want them to know they can custom order direct from our factories.Offering your size, style and color is never a problem with a custom preorder. This Indiegogo is focused on giving you the opportunity to custom order the exact shoe you want from our collection. Right now!                                LET ME BE HONEST:Making shoes is an incredible process! It is like being an architect each time you create a new style. It has to hold weight, move and fit the foot right. Then the design process has many elements. Different components are manufactured, created and sewn in sometimes over 15 factories just to make one shoe. Think about it. Look at all the different parts on the shoe on your foot now. The upper, sole and details are all manufactured in different locations. We are skilled and have this part covered. We are great at what we do. Mink shoes are made to perfection.                    THE PROBLEM:Each Mink shoe collection is handmade in limited production. Having the right size and style for everyone is impossible. This is our problem. We want you to have the size and style you want. If you custom order your shoe you can get exactly what you want... and at a lower price! Win + Win for all. Basically the money from the campaign goes to make your desired shoes. Our focus is making Italian shoes affordable. You buy the shoes and we go to work making it custom preordered for you. Problem solved. That simple.                      THE SOLUTION:We need you to custom preorder your favorite shoes, share this campaign and get vegan shoes on more peoples feet then ever before in history. You can help make high quality vegan shoes available. Our goal with this  Indiegogo is to make our clients happy. Preorder now and it is possible to give you exactly what you desire!           THE PLANET AND THE PEOPLE: Mink shoes are made from recycled and organic materials, non animals glues, veggie plastics, naturally tapped rubber, cork, wood, bamboo and other sustainable materials. All Mink employees and factory workers are treated with respect and in doing so we have developed a deep unbreakable bond. We all have the passion for for making immaculate shoes with the added benefit of also being a sustainable transparent brand.                  THE ANIMALS:A Mink shoe is proof that you do not need to harm animals to make fabulous shoes. I come from the mind of being an animal welfare activist.  I want to show people that a leather shoe is not better! It cracks in water, is reacts horribly to heat. No leather is used on a boat for this reason. Without toxic chemicals leather is biodegradable and falls apart. Non leather is superior. Why use abused animals skins!? Lets get off that strange addiction.I have produced and sourced the best fabrics available in Italy. We have also made breathable, water proof and high performance options. We are a pioneers on a mission to prove that you do not need any animal products to make luxury goods. LETS DO THIS:Mink is often looked at like a fashion company. Yes it is.. but it's roots are deep in making a lifestyle brand with no animals harmed. This is a cause you can get behind and getting fabulous shoes is a bonus. There is a limited window for custom ordering.  This campaign is only 15 DAYS!! ORDER YOUR CUSTOM MINKS NOW.....                     PLEASE SHARE:We appreciate you supporting vegan shoes. Please post, tweet, email, call and shout this out to the world. Our goal is to make certain everyone can get Mink's on their feet. This is only going to be available for 15 days! Let everyone you know about Mink's Indigogo. They will thank you.

First A.I Watch® concept sketch:



A.I Watch® concept start getting life in 3D:









First generation A.I Watch® assembled board:After more than 200 tests from our teams around the world we got better ideas for our prototype to gain space in the watch, increase hardware, add more features and save battery consumption.So we got a brilliant idea to gain space : Why not building in the bracelet the speaker and the Micro Sim Card reader, so we start to review all the hardware, design to pack as much technology into the A.I Watch® as humanly possible by combining the best hardware and software together. This is the result of more than one year of hard work:After a lot of tests on our prototype, then definitely it was build and working.We had now to finalize the design of our A.I Watch, it was a very important part in the A.I Watch® development; We love fashion and luxuries designs but also our goals was to develop a smart watch that looks like a watch.After we start working on the bracelet; we checked different materials; some time just to feel the touch of them : PU, silicone (More than 10 different qualities), leather etc...We were determinate to use the best materials to custom our A.I Watch and finally we decided for a high quality TPU bracelet with a smooth feeling.Now we reach the point of the most exciting part of our adventure: The assembling parts:A.I Watch® board assembled in a aluminium caseDesign and A.I Watch® collections:✔A.I Watch® Collections was designed in France✔A.I Watch® Love Fashion and Luxuries designs✔A.I Watch® was designed for both Men and Women.➤ Sports & Fashion Design a collection full of colors and full of LIFE We call it “LA Vie""A.I Watch® come in an elegant aluminium watch case and a fashion high quality silicone bracelet:  The colors available for ""La Vie"" collection are : Red, Blue, Yellow, Orange, Black, White and Pink.

<h1>How Does The One Backpack Modular System Work?</h1>
<p>Powered by Fidlock, the easy-to-use instant secure magnetic hardware, The One Backpack provides slick modularity through the magnetic system that quickly and securely attaches modules to the pack. <b>Just Click and Go. </b></p>

<h1><b>ITR One Backpack Features</b></h1>
<p>The One Backpack is designed to be <b>durable, functional, comfortable and stylish</b>. Let's start with the exterior of the bag. </p>
<div data-id=""20888181""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1528395127/vgdl2y1etw0bbe2nvlqz.png"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p>It comes with a removable Magnetic Key Chain that allows you to detach when needed.  </p>

<p>On the inside, there are pockets for you to keep longer items such as your camera gimbal. You can also reach them from the quick access opening.  </p>

<h1>Weight Management </h1>
<p>One of the biggest complains from backpack users is that their bag doesn't handle the weight very well, giving them <b>back pain</b> after a regular two hours commute a day. By attaching everything close to your back, we can <b>distribute the weight more evenly</b> and swift the center of gravity closer to your body, so you won’t feel you are being pulled back by the backpack and <b>make it feel lighter</b>. SMART, yes!</p>
<div data-id=""20888198""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1528395130/pcaoqkfsjykrjd98j71p.png"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<h1>　</h1>
<h1>Durability &amp; Comfort</h1>
<p>The shoulder straps of a backpack are usually sewed directly to the body, and it makes the connection point a <b>common breakpoint </b>of a regular backpack. Some manufacturers use leather straps but they are just so <b>painful to wear.</b></p>
<div data-id=""20888204""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1528395132/ygzndadbz3wfsn6fogsg.png"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p>Using premium leather to <b>reinforce the common breaking point</b> of a regular backpack, we brilliantly merge a leather strap with a padded strap to <b>provide maximum comfort</b> without sacrificing strength. The connection points are also <b>bolted to maximize durability</b>. A <b>complete overhaul backpack structure</b> that will last a lifetime. </p>

<h1>How to Back?   </h1>
<p>It takes just 60 seconds…</p>
<p><b>1. Choose a reward level. </b><br/>You choose one (and only one) reward level to back this project. You cannot choose 2 reward levels. Just one. You will get all items in that reward—you cannot swap things that you don't want for things that you do want. See the FAQ for why we can't do this.</p>

How Does The One Backpack Modular System Work?
Powered by Fidlock, the easy-to-use instant secure magnetic hardware, The One Backpack provides slick modularity through the magnetic system that quickly and securely attaches modules to the pack. Just Click and Go. 

ITR One Backpack Features
The One Backpack is designed to be durable, functional, comfortable and stylish. Let's start with the exterior of the bag. 

It comes with a removable Magnetic Key Chain that allows you to detach when needed.  

On the inside, there are pockets for you to keep longer items such as your camera gimbal. You can also reach them from the quick access opening.  


　
Weight Management 
One of the biggest complains from backpack users is that their bag doesn't handle the weight very well, giving them back pain after a regular two hours commute a day. By attaching everything close to your back, we can distribute the weight more evenly and swift the center of gravity closer to your body, so you won’t feel you are being pulled back by the backpack and make it feel lighter. SMART, yes!

　
Durability & Comfort
The shoulder straps of a backpack are usually sewed directly to the body, and it makes the connection point a common breakpoint of a regular backpack. Some manufacturers use leather straps but they are just so painful to wear.

Using premium leather to reinforce the common breaking point of a regular backpack, we brilliantly merge a leather strap with a padded strap to provide maximum comfort without sacrificing strength. The connection points are also bolted to maximize durability. A complete overhaul backpack structure that will last a lifetime.

<p>I am Adam David Vaught, founder and creator of Black Confederacy Clothing. My passion for clothing and design began at a young age, but did not materialize until well into adulthood. Growing up in the city of Detroit, becoming a fashion designer was not a picture of normalcy. Talking about patterns, stitches and design was not a topic of conversation among my peer group. For awhile, I followed the traditional notions of ""getting a job"" and living the status quo that is deemed acceptable by society's standards. However, it wasn't long before I had to break away from such limiting beliefs and follow my dreams - my true purpose.   </p>

<p>I began sewing approximately 7 years ago. I started off taking a few classes, but realized I could teach myself and go much farther than what was being offered, so I sought to do just that and I am primarily self-taught. I constantly read and study the craft of design. I create my pieces from scratch, and I am a believer that the smallest detail can leave the most lasting impressions. </p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br/><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate"">
<p>To date, I have made numerous custom and ready-to-wear pieces for clients near and far, ranging from jeans and denim shirts to dresses and handbags. I have never regretted taking the road less traveled because, in my journey, I have answered my true calling. And I will let my work ethic and passion speak for itself.</p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br/><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate"">

<p><i><b>Description of The Black Confederacy Campaign and the Importance of My Mission:</b></i><br/></p>
<p>The inherent nature of <i>Black Confederacy </i>invites questions and curiosity as to its derivation - mostly because many associate ""confederate"" or the ""confederate flag"" with racism, bigotry, and other negative connotations. However, the Black Confederacy name holds special significance to me because it was born out of the concept that you can take what many may view as a negative image and disarm it, as well as reshape it to reacquaint itself with its positive roots. 'Confederacy' simply means an alliance or union of people for a common purpose or cause. 'Black' has generally been associated with dark, mysterious things, or underdogs of our society. The Black Confederacy brand has bridged these two concepts together and brought it to the forefront that the underestimated or unexpected can come together for a common cause and that is the cause of FASHION. </p>

<p><b>MY BRAND. MY PASSION </b><br/></p>
<p>This campaign is so important to me because I believe that it will allow me to take my business to the next level. The funds will help me to increase visibility to my brand as well as confirm my identity and credibility as a true designer who is serious about his craft and the vision of his brand.</p>
<p>I am so excited about Black Confederacy because it is the single greatest expression of who I am and what I believe fashion to be. <br/></p>
<p><i><b>Magnitude of Contributors' Support:</b></i><br/></p>
<p>I love to create, so with this campaign, I want to create customers, believers in the brand, fans, and quite possibly partners. The bottom line is that I cannot do this without you. You are my greatest asset.  My goal is to have my clothing line in stores and online, and by helping me further my passion and make my dreams a reality, you invest in my life and there is no greater investment one can make. </p>

<b>BC</b></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","My Start. My Story. 

I am Adam David Vaught, founder and creator of Black Confederacy Clothing. My passion for clothing and design began at a young age, but did not materialize until well into adulthood. Growing up in the city of Detroit, becoming a fashion designer was not a picture of normalcy. Talking about patterns, stitches and design was not a topic of conversation among my peer group. For awhile, I followed the traditional notions of ""getting a job"" and living the status quo that is deemed acceptable by society's standards. However, it wasn't long before I had to break away from such limiting beliefs and follow my dreams - my true purpose.   

I began sewing approximately 7 years ago. I started off taking a few classes, but realized I could teach myself and go much farther than what was being offered, so I sought to do just that and I am primarily self-taught. I constantly read and study the craft of design. I create my pieces from scratch, and I am a believer that the smallest detail can leave the most lasting impressions. 
To date, I have made numerous custom and ready-to-wear pieces for clients near and far, ranging from jeans and denim shirts to dresses and handbags. I have never regretted taking the road less traveled because, in my journey, I have answered my true calling. And I will let my work ethic and passion speak for itself.



 


Description of The Black Confederacy Campaign and the Importance of My Mission:
The inherent nature of Black Confederacy invites questions and curiosity as to its derivation - mostly because many associate ""confederate"" or the ""confederate flag"" with racism, bigotry, and other negative connotations. However, the Black Confederacy name holds special significance to me because it was born out of the concept that you can take what many may view as a negative image and disarm it, as well as reshape it to reacquaint itself with its positive roots. 'Confederacy' simply means an alliance or union of people for a common purpose or cause. 'Black' has generally been associated with dark, mysterious things, or underdogs of our society. The Black Confederacy brand has bridged these two concepts together and brought it to the forefront that the underestimated or unexpected can come together for a common cause and that is the cause of FASHION. 





MY BRAND. MY PASSION 
This campaign is so important to me because I believe that it will allow me to take my business to the next level. The funds will help me to increase visibility to my brand as well as confirm my identity and credibility as a true designer who is serious about his craft and the vision of his brand.
I am so excited about Black Confederacy because it is the single greatest expression of who I am and what I believe fashion to be. 
Magnitude of Contributors' Support:
I love to create, so with this campaign, I want to create customers, believers in the brand, fans, and quite possibly partners. The bottom line is that I cannot do this without you. You are my greatest asset.  My goal is to have my clothing line in stores and online, and by helping me further my passion and make my dreams a reality, you invest in my life and there is no greater investment one can make. 

What I Need & What You Get & Enjoy
The amount needed is $15,000. Your generous contributions will cover the cost of the following:3 new industrial sewing machines; fabric in bulk; various custom notions (buttons, rivets, more hang tags, and name tags); a newer more updated website; a new laptop with more storage capacity and better graphics for my pattern making software; a new camera for better quality pictures for next year's look book. A fabric saw for multilayer cutting and smarter production time. This money will also allow me to set up my fashion show/trunk show for late 2014. And for helping me in such a generous and selfless way, you will be perked out with PERKS!!! (See below)

*out of respect and fairness to the boutique/retail owners, proof of store ownership is required.Of course, I hope to reach (or surpass!) my goal of $15,000, but if I don't, I am still humbly thankful and grateful for all of your help!!!  Your contributions will help me in the building my brand and making future campaigns possible.

All our products are made in-house from locally sourced materials by a small team of designers and craftspeople using tradional and modern technologies together - we're offering personalization not just because we can, but as a way to add meaning to these things beyond their look and function.

<h2> </h2>
<h2>Logos &amp; Artwork</h2>
<p>If you plan to use a logo/artwork or graphic on one of the rewards, please be aware that there are certain guidelines you'll need to follow, and not everybodys graphic will be suitable straight away. The most common issue people may encounter is having too much detail in their graphic - we'll clearly explain this when you place your order, but as a rule of thumb, refer to all our images above to get an idea of the maximum detail we're capable of and try to imagine your artwork on the products above when viewed from an arms-length away - if you can't make something out then chances are it's too detailed. We require Hi-resolution images in black &amp; white (monochrome) Bitmap format. We'll provide extensive instructions and visual tutorials on how to convert your graphic into this form when we send out your online order form, but really it's not that difficult - Microsoft Paint can even do this for you. </p>
<h2>----------------------------------------------------------</h2>
<p> </p>
<h2>Taking &amp; Processing Backers Orders</h2>
<p>At the end of the campaign, we'll send each backer an online form specific to their pledge product. This form will contain all the necessary fields that will help them tailor their order exactly, and will include all the ""Options"" listed in the reward sections above, specific to each reward. In many cases there will be even more options to choose from, such as text alignment, size, location and some fancy extras! You'll be able to attach any necessary logos/artwork via this form too, and all options will be clearly represented visually with examples of ""Option A vs Option B"". This online order form system is something we've used for a long time, so we know it works. All are already created and ready to go, and take about 5 minutes to fill out.</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>We've been making things for people for years now through our existing business ""Bespoke Laser Sydney"", but we recently realized that there was more to what we were doing than just servicing locals - we could do the same thing for people everywhere. We took some of the most common and best things we were asked to build and made them into the template products you see above. If this project is successful, we'll fulfil all the orders, make sure everybody is happy, then think about our next move - we're using this campaign as a way to test our theory that others are looking for the kind of service we provide - hopefully it's not just a hunch!</p>
<p>We're embarking on one of the biggest Indiegogo campaigns yet, don't let our funding goal fool you. Technology is at the stage where the costs that large corporations were saving from mass production are becoming easily achieved by small businesses - conceiving a new wave in production called mass customization. We want to prove that no matter how many orders we get, we can personalize each individual one just for you. By not branding our designs, we're not passing those marketing costs on to you, and allowing you to cherish something more meaningful.</p>
<h2>The Team</h2>
<p>Angus Deveson - Production manager</p>
<p>Dan Sutherland - Lead Designer</p>
<p>Dylan Murray - Operations Manager</p>
<p>Nathan Kaw - Industrial Designer</p>
<p>Olivia King - Graphic Designer</p>
<p>Tim Veron - Marketing &amp; Social Media</p>
<p>Scott Triana - Business Development Manager</p>
<p>Matt Triana - Business Development Manager</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Why Indiegogo?</h2>
<p>Some people have asked why we don't just make an online store and be done with it.. well truth be told, we don't know for sure if this is something people are really looking for - being based in Australia (total population of only 23 million) it's difficult to overcome the geographical isolation and prove whether something like this is worth the effort. In addition, we don't have the time or funds to do so. For this to work, and for us to be able to slow our regular business to have the time for something bigger, we need that initial volume that only a crowdfunding campaign can provide. We're a small, young team (5 people on-and-off, our oldest is 25), so just spending the time to create this campaign is already a gamble, and we're all in. In addition, we want to gain that volume to be able to scrutinize our suppliers and doubly ensure the materials we use are good for people and the environment. Any extra funds we raise will be put towards making our current systems more efficient and again, better for people &amp; the environment. One day we'd love to operate out of the US. If successful here, we will look to seek extra capital to expand only once all of our backers are taken care of.</p>
<p>We've personally been on the receiving end of some terribly run crowdfunding campaigns and we're often left wondering where the money went - not this time. We've set our prices at a point that covers our costs and gives enough space to be able to expand to just the point where we will ensure orders are fulfilled quickly, and all enquiries/concerns/issues are dealt with - we plan to run an exceptional campaign right up to the last order - we'll spend what it takes to ensure that.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges<span style=""font-size: 10px;""> </span>
</h2>
<p>In terms of our ability - we already produce similar items for our clients at Bespoke laser (<a href=""http://www.bespokelaser.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.bespokelaser.com/</a>) - our custom laser cutting studio that has been operating successfully in Sydney for over a year. We have two laser cutters, a fully equipped workshop, a team of 5 who can operate everything expertly, and a strong operational system in place to handle orders. We have combined years of experience in product design and manufacturing, especially for laser cutting. We know exactly how to make all of these products - and we control all aspects of the production from our Sydney studio. Every single product you see above was produced in our workshop by us - at the current funding target, we can fulfil that amount of orders within the space of about 5 weeks without needing to change or up the way we currently operate or our rate of output.</p>
<p>That being said, we may experience a significant increase in volume past our stated goal. We have planned for this, and many combinations of scenarios. We already have contingency plans in place that include the lease of additional space in Sydney, the purchase and operation of additional laser cutters and machinery. In addition, we're already part of a strong community of local manufacturers here in Sydney that we can call on to assist if all else fails.</p>
<p>Our materials suppliers are all competent, aware and reliable, eliminating the risk of materials shortfalls. We will be processing orders as soon as we reach our funding target to reduce lead time.</p>
<p>We know we are amongst the most capable to deliver this project properly and on time - we wouldn't have embarked on such a big project if we thought otherwise. Check out our business mentioned above if you have doubts - we're happily putting it's reputation on the line here.</p>
<h2>Your Future With Us</h2>
<p>If you're really impressed with what we're trying to do here, you haven't seen the start of it. Our team of forward-thinking, entrepreneuarial minds are highly motivated to push the boundaries of our consumer culture in the world of creative design.

We've designed and made a range of products that can be personalized uniquely for you or anybody else. On the right hand side, you'll see a range of perks at varying prices. These all correspond to the detailed descriptions & photos below, where you can see exactly how you can customize each item. 
Select your favorite perk, or many perks! You'll be taken through to a payment processing page, and we'll be in touch with a customization form when the campaign is over. 
A real wooden protective backing for your iPhone 4/4S or 5, custom engraved to your specifications. Choose from American Walnut, Cherry or Maple. So thin you won't notice it's there - jealous onlookers definitely will. Easily applied to the back glass face of your phone using a hi-tack / no-residue adhesive tape in only a few seconds. It can be removed and even re-applied to another iPhone. Includes Shipping.
We thought that something that rests around your neck and sits close to your heart should be personalized by you. Choose from American Walnut, Bamboo or Hoop Pine and have something meaningful to you engraved in one of Mother Nature's greatest gift. See our photos for just some of the possibilities. Comes with either a black ball chain (hangs at 20 inches/508mm) or a classic silver plated chain (hangs at 8 inches/203mm), and an optional split-ring. Includes Shipping.

Measures 3.8in/96mm x 3.2in/81mm. Comes beautifully boxed. Includes Shipping.

Includes Shipping.
 
Get Bespoked - $500
Spend a day with us at our Sydney based workshop where you'll get to see 4 products of your choosing get made right in front of you, on the spot, just the way you want them. We'll even go all out and provide a full lunch spread and plenty of time to chat to the founders about any of your own ideas.
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most of our rewards come beautifully boxed as standard, just like you see here - please see the item description of each reward for details.
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is a great selection of fonts to choose from, if you choose text as a customization option. When it comes to laying it out, you'll be given a range of options again, such as justification/alignment (in some cases), otherwise you'll also be able leave it to our Graphic Designers to work their magic. Please note that not all fonts have all regular punctuation and extras - please limit your text to only the most common when necessary i.e !@$&%#*. Numbers are available in each font, however fonts listed in capitals do not have lower-cases.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You’ll have plenty of different monogram options to choose from once the campaign ends and we send out surveys. You’ll be able to choose the font and a maximum of 3 letters to be made into a stylish looking mark by our talented Graphic Designers. Above are some of the examples that we’ve used on our products so far. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Logos & Artwork
If you plan to use a logo/artwork or graphic on one of the rewards, please be aware that there are certain guidelines you'll need to follow, and not everybodys graphic will be suitable straight away. The most common issue people may encounter is having too much detail in their graphic - we'll clearly explain this when you place your order, but as a rule of thumb, refer to all our images above to get an idea of the maximum detail we're capable of and try to imagine your artwork on the products above when viewed from an arms-length away - if you can't make something out then chances are it's too detailed. We require Hi-resolution images in black & white (monochrome) Bitmap format. We'll provide extensive instructions and visual tutorials on how to convert your graphic into this form when we send out your online order form, but really it's not that difficult - Microsoft Paint can even do this for you. 
----------------------------------------------------------
 
Taking & Processing Backers Orders
At the end of the campaign, we'll send each backer an online form specific to their pledge product. This form will contain all the necessary fields that will help them tailor their order exactly, and will include all the ""Options"" listed in the reward sections above, specific to each reward. In many cases there will be even more options to choose from, such as text alignment, size, location and some fancy extras! You'll be able to attach any necessary logos/artwork via this form too, and all options will be clearly represented visually with examples of ""Option A vs Option B"". This online order form system is something we've used for a long time, so we know it works. All are already created and ready to go, and take about 5 minutes to fill out.

Our Story
We've been making things for people for years now through our existing business ""Bespoke Laser Sydney"", but we recently realized that there was more to what we were doing than just servicing locals - we could do the same thing for people everywhere. We took some of the most common and best things we were asked to build and made them into the template products you see above. If this project is successful, we'll fulfil all the orders, make sure everybody is happy, then think about our next move - we're using this campaign as a way to test our theory that others are looking for the kind of service we provide - hopefully it's not just a hunch!
We're embarking on one of the biggest Indiegogo campaigns yet, don't let our funding goal fool you. Technology is at the stage where the costs that large corporations were saving from mass production are becoming easily achieved by small businesses - conceiving a new wave in production called mass customization. We want to prove that no matter how many orders we get, we can personalize each individual one just for you. By not branding our designs, we're not passing those marketing costs on to you, and allowing you to cherish something more meaningful.

Why Indiegogo?
Some people have asked why we don't just make an online store and be done with it.. well truth be told, we don't know for sure if this is something people are really looking for - being based in Australia (total population of only 23 million) it's difficult to overcome the geographical isolation and prove whether something like this is worth the effort. In addition, we don't have the time or funds to do so. For this to work, and for us to be able to slow our regular business to have the time for something bigger, we need that initial volume that only a crowdfunding campaign can provide. We're a small, young team (5 people on-and-off, our oldest is 25), so just spending the time to create this campaign is already a gamble, and we're all in. In addition, we want to gain that volume to be able to scrutinize our suppliers and doubly ensure the materials we use are good for people and the environment. Any extra funds we raise will be put towards making our current systems more efficient and again, better for people & the environment. One day we'd love to operate out of the US. If successful here, we will look to seek extra capital to expand only once all of our backers are taken care of.
We've personally been on the receiving end of some terribly run crowdfunding campaigns and we're often left wondering where the money went - not this time. We've set our prices at a point that covers our costs and gives enough space to be able to expand to just the point where we will ensure orders are fulfilled quickly, and all enquiries/concerns/issues are dealt with - we plan to run an exceptional campaign right up to the last order - we'll spend what it takes to ensure that.
 
Risks & Challenges 

In terms of our ability - we already produce similar items for our clients at Bespoke laser (http://www.bespokelaser.com/) - our custom laser cutting studio that has been operating successfully in Sydney for over a year. We have two laser cutters, a fully equipped workshop, a team of 5 who can operate everything expertly, and a strong operational system in place to handle orders. We have combined years of experience in product design and manufacturing, especially for laser cutting. We know exactly how to make all of these products - and we control all aspects of the production from our Sydney studio. Every single product you see above was produced in our workshop by us - at the current funding target, we can fulfil that amount of orders within the space of about 5 weeks without needing to change or up the way we currently operate or our rate of output.
That being said, we may experience a significant increase in volume past our stated goal. We have planned for this, and many combinations of scenarios. We already have contingency plans in place that include the lease of additional space in Sydney, the purchase and operation of additional laser cutters and machinery. In addition, we're already part of a strong community of local manufacturers here in Sydney that we can call on to assist if all else fails.
Our materials suppliers are all competent, aware and reliable, eliminating the risk of materials shortfalls. We will be processing orders as soon as we reach our funding target to reduce lead time.
We know we are amongst the most capable to deliver this project properly and on time - we wouldn't have embarked on such a big project if we thought otherwise. Check out our business mentioned above if you have doubts - we're happily putting it's reputation on the line here.

Meet Vierra: The Last Watch You'll Ever Need to Buy

 

Typically when you're buying a watch, you select it because it has a really cool design or it's super durable & waterproof. With our watches, we have eliminated the need for you to make a choice between the two.
Vierra watches are 100M water resistant, have a sapphire crystal display, and backed by a lifetime warranty - all under $150.







In The Press





Features




The Lineup









Unbeatable Lifetime Warranty
We are so confident in our watches that we are offering a 100% replacement lifetime warranty.  If it breaks, for whatever reason, send us your old one back and we'll ship you a new one! Most warranties only cover manufacturers defects, but we're here to change that - we want you to be satisfied for LIFE!

If Funded, When Will We Fulfill?



We've repeatedly tested and tweaked the initial prototype. From there we finalized our design and purchased the molds with a reputable manufacturer. Our vetting process for the manufacturer took over 6 months and have built a trusting relationship.  After our 30 day campaign is over, Indiegogo releases the funds to us and we'll pay the manufacturer to begin production.  The estimated production time is roughly 50-60 days, depending on the quantity of the order.  As soon as we receive the watches, we'll work around the clock to ship out the watches to our awesome supporters!

<p>Its high 28,800 bph (8 beats per second) impart it with a super smooth sweep of the seconds hand.</p>
<p>It was developed and is manufactured by Miyota, an iconic Japanese manufacturer with a reputation for quality, reliability and precision. The 90S5/9015 is ideally suited for an heirloom watch like the Rossling &amp; Co. Metropolitan.</p>

<p>Hello! We are Nadim, Terry and Karim, entrepreneurs and watch lovers. We started out as two brothers designing our first watch collection in 2013 after we couldn’t find what we wanted on the market. As the company grew, Karim, our third brother, joined us and Rossling &amp; Co. became three-brothers strong. Our first model was a success beyond our expectations on a crowdfunding platform with close to 1,300 backers. We then launched our Classic Automatic collection in the fall of 2014 and our Modern 36mm collection last summer. Both were huge successes, raising multiple times their initial funding goal. We are beyond excited to launch the Metropolitan Automatic and we can’t wait to get it on your wrists. </p>

</div>","We are delighted to introduce the Metropolitan Automatic, Rossling & Co.'s latest watch collection. Featuring our most sophisticated designs to date and high spec automatic movements. Its understated style will impress with its presence.





 





We designed the Metropolitan models with the firm belief that style should never get in the way of function, but should naturally derive from it. True style complements function. It should be subtle, never loud or trendy. It should be timeless, never rendered obsolete by new technology. 





 





Rossling & Co. has been crafting watches for over three years, with the Metropolitan Automatic being our fourth collection. We have developed strong expertise in design, manufacturing and fulfillment and have solid relationships with experienced manufacturing partners.





Every single component of the Metropolitan is made from superior materials to ensure flawless operations for years to come. It was designed to be an heirloom to be passed down to the next generation. 





 





Our direct-to-consumer business model means we skip the distributors and retailers and pass the savings down to you. 





 



Exhibition caseback allows full view of the automatic movement


The Metropolitan Automatic models all feature an exhibition caseback with a large window showcasing the beautiful automatic movement.  You will be able to observe the rotor spinning and admire the engineering that goes into the design of the beating heart of an automatic watch.



Double domed bubble crystal


One of the signature elements of the Metropolitan Automatic collection is the double domed bubble crystal covering the dial. Reminiscent of the bold mid-century modern designs of the 60s, it gives the watch an undeniable presence. The domed shape creates a slight distortion at the edge of the crystal, a signature look of 60s watches and part of the unique character of the Metropolitan watch.



Miyota 9015 movement (courtesy Miyota Citizen Japan)


The Calibre 90S5/9015 used in the Metropolitan Automatic watches is an exceptional high-spec, Japan-made automatic movement featuring a 42-hour power reserve. 
It is a 3-hand movement that has been favorably compared to the ETA2824 movement used in luxury watches such as Baume & Mercier, Bell & Ross and Tudor. 
Its high 28,800 bph (8 beats per second) impart it with a super smooth sweep of the seconds hand.
It was developed and is manufactured by Miyota, an iconic Japanese manufacturer with a reputation for quality, reliability and precision. The 90S5/9015 is ideally suited for an heirloom watch like the Rossling & Co. Metropolitan.



Faux-croc genuine leather straps


All Metropolitan Automatic watches feature a faux-croc genuine leather strap with genuine leather backing for ultimate comfort and durability. The polished buckle is engraved with the Rossling & Co. logo.



Solid stainless steel 316L case and crown


The case of the watch is made of highly polished stainless steel (316L) for ultimate durability and strength. The low profile crown allows for easy adjustment of the time or date.



Metropolitan Automatic dial details


The Metropolitan Automatic collection showcases 3 different dial colors (gloss black, gloss white and sunburst blue) each available in 2 dial layout options (Classic and Open-Heart). All dials feature hand-applied polished indices and diamond cut hands. 
The Open-Heart layout features a round window at 6 o’clock showcasing the 90S5 movement. 
The Classic layout features a square date window at 6 o’clock.




Certificate of authenticity and warranty card


The Metropolitan Automatic watches available for pre-order will be hand-assembled as a limited-edition. Only 399 watches will be made for each model. Each watch will be delivered with an international 2-year warranty card and a certificate of authenticity. Each watch will feature a unique serial number on the caseback (ex.: 001/399). 





 





The Metropolitan Black is for the man of the world. It conveys an air of mystery and effortless charm.





 





 






 





The Metropolitan White is for the classical man. Subtle, recognized by those in the know, it exudes confidence and charisma.





 





 





 





The Metropolitan Blue is our boldest design; for the man that does not fear being noticed. It has undeniable presence and personality.

Case Thickness: 11.9 mm 
Lug/Strap Width: 20mm 
Double-Domed Bubble Crystal (AR coated)

<h3>Why We Are Here</h3>
<p>During my military service in Taiwan, we were provided with hard and uncomfortable boots along with thin socks that easily tore. After only walking and standing for a few hours, my feet began to blister and the foot pain was noticeable. Since there was no way I could change my boots, I started to find ways to change what goes inside them (I couldn't replace my feet). During that time, I have bought more than 30 pairs of socks to try out but did not find what I was looking for. Each pair of socks I bought either only had anti-odor, arch support, or anti-blister properties, if at all. It was frustrating to find the perfect pair of socks that makes wearing uncomfortable shoes more tolerable. I experienced how uncomfortable unsuitable socks could be - and I don't want others to have to go through what I had. That’s why I have designed my own socks - the Neverquit Socks.</p>

It is the perfect option for all women to still feel fashionable, but also safe, especially when going out. We have fully working prototypes and now need to gather a critical mass of orders to bring the cost of production down and deliver Amuleto to you for a reasonable price.Time is a critical factor in the case of assault, abduction, or a sudden health problem; But in most cases, victims or those in need of medical assistance do not always have the chance to dial for help. While there are other safety alert wearables on the market, many of them use unflattering, materials such as plastic.

By backing our project, your pre-orders will help fund the first production run in a quantity that keeps the price acceptable for most people.
