<strong>Description</strong><br/>
</h2>
<p>A Game for “Good” Christians is card game which shows what you get if “Cards Against Humanity” and a conservative Christian seminary had a love child. Or if Apples to Apples was made by thoughtful pastors who read more than the footnotes in an NIV Bible.</p>
<p>A Game for “Good” Christians is made for people of all levels of Biblical knowledge, Jews, gentiles, atheists and agnostics: whether you dropped out of Sunday or Saturday school, or are throwing good money after bad in seminary, you’re guaranteed hours of thought-provoking fun, until the Rapture hits, or God strikes your house with lightning.</p>
<p>If you feel like a horrible person afterwards, you're probably doing it right, but remember: blame the player, not the game.</p>
<p><em><strong>NOTE:</strong></em> <em>since we're not sure how much shipping will actually cost, we're not including shipping &amp; handling costs in the perks.  </em><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Dear Clergy/Church leaders: You can purchase this game anonymously since you know you want a copy! <br/></strong></p>
<h2><strong>Game Play</strong></h2>
<p>For the first round, each player draws a hand of “canon” answer cards, and one player is chosen to begin the game as “the Pharisee.” The Pharisee then presents a “creed” question card to the group, like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>“For Lent I am giving up_____.”</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>“What do good Christians wait until marriage for?”</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>“King Solomon needed so many women because he was over-compensating for _____.”</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>“Loving your neighbor as yourself includes _____.”</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>“When good Christians don't understand something in the Old Testament, they simply add Jesus and _____.”</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>“What is known to make the baby Jesus cry?”</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p> Each player passes one faced-down canon card to the Pharisee in response. The canon deck includes such biblical gems as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>The forbidden fruit (Genesis 3)</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Noah's awkward sexual encounter with his son ( Genesis 9:22)</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Levitical sex ban (Lev 18)</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>David carrying a warm sack of 200 foreskins (1 Sam 18:26-28)</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>A pair of she bears mauling a group of kindergarteners (2 Kings 2:23-25)</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>A naked boy running through Gethsemane (Mark 14:51-52)</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Midgets in trees (Luke 19:1-10)</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>The voice of God knocking you off your ass, on your ass (Acts 9)</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>A slightly stoned Paul (Acts 14:19)</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Making stupid life choices and blaming them on Php 4:13 (Php 4:13)</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>A roaring lion seeking whom he may devour (1 Peter 5:8)</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>After the players submit their canon cards, the Pharisee shuffles all of the answers, reads the responses out loud, and chooses his/her favorite card: the most biblically accurate, the most humorous, the card most likely to send the player to hell, or all of the above.</p>
<p>The winning player is given the Creed card from that round and the next player in line becomes the new Pharisee. The first player to collect ten Creed cards wins.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Why We Are Here</strong></p>
<p>This game was developed after years of encouraging our friends and family to “dig deeper” into what the text of the Bible means, and many irreverent and deeply theological conversations.</p>
<p>We’ve created and printed multiple mock versions of the game, which we piloted with friends and family, clergy and lay people, and people all over the spectrum of belief and lack thereof.</p>
<p>Based on the feedback we feel it is now time to focus our efforts to bring this game to a larger audience, so we are <strong>launching this project to raise the $8,000 we need to cover our first print run of the game and bring all this awesomeness to you.</strong></p>
<p>If you want to own a copy this game, please help us reach our goal, or all this Biblical goodness will pass away. If this game makes you worry for your immortal soul, just remember: we love the Bible, we just have a funny way of showing It.</p>

Description

A Game for “Good” Christians is card game which shows what you get if “Cards Against Humanity” and a conservative Christian seminary had a love child. Or if Apples to Apples was made by thoughtful pastors who read more than the footnotes in an NIV Bible.
A Game for “Good” Christians is made for people of all levels of Biblical knowledge, Jews, gentiles, atheists and agnostics: whether you dropped out of Sunday or Saturday school, or are throwing good money after bad in seminary, you’re guaranteed hours of thought-provoking fun, until the Rapture hits, or God strikes your house with lightning.
If you feel like a horrible person afterwards, you're probably doing it right, but remember: blame the player, not the game.
NOTE: since we're not sure how much shipping will actually cost, we're not including shipping & handling costs in the perks.  
Dear Clergy/Church leaders: You can purchase this game anonymously since you know you want a copy! 
Game Play
For the first round, each player draws a hand of “canon” answer cards, and one player is chosen to begin the game as “the Pharisee.” The Pharisee then presents a “creed” question card to the group, like:

“For Lent I am giving up_____.”


“What do good Christians wait until marriage for?”


“King Solomon needed so many women because he was over-compensating for _____.”


“Loving your neighbor as yourself includes _____.”


“When good Christians don't understand something in the Old Testament, they simply add Jesus and _____.”


“What is known to make the baby Jesus cry?”

 Each player passes one faced-down canon card to the Pharisee in response. The canon deck includes such biblical gems as:

The forbidden fruit (Genesis 3)


Noah's awkward sexual encounter with his son ( Genesis 9:22)


Levitical sex ban (Lev 18)


David carrying a warm sack of 200 foreskins (1 Sam 18:26-28)


A pair of she bears mauling a group of kindergarteners (2 Kings 2:23-25)


A naked boy running through Gethsemane (Mark 14:51-52)


Midgets in trees (Luke 19:1-10)


The voice of God knocking you off your ass, on your ass (Acts 9)


A slightly stoned Paul (Acts 14:19)


Making stupid life choices and blaming them on Php 4:13 (Php 4:13)


A roaring lion seeking whom he may devour (1 Peter 5:8)

After the players submit their canon cards, the Pharisee shuffles all of the answers, reads the responses out loud, and chooses his/her favorite card: the most biblically accurate, the most humorous, the card most likely to send the player to hell, or all of the above.
The winning player is given the Creed card from that round and the next player in line becomes the new Pharisee. The first player to collect ten Creed cards wins.
 
Why We Are Here
This game was developed after years of encouraging our friends and family to “dig deeper” into what the text of the Bible means, and many irreverent and deeply theological conversations.
We’ve created and printed multiple mock versions of the game, which we piloted with friends and family, clergy and lay people, and people all over the spectrum of belief and lack thereof.
Based on the feedback we feel it is now time to focus our efforts to bring this game to a larger audience, so we are launching this project to raise the $8,000 we need to cover our first print run of the game and bring all this awesomeness to you.
If you want to own a copy this game, please help us reach our goal, or all this Biblical goodness will pass away. If this game makes you worry for your immortal soul, just remember: we love the Bible, we just have a funny way of showing It.
 
 FAQ

We want you to figure out why you’re offended, especially if/when the card is a direct quote from the Bible. We love to hear “I didn’t know that was in the Bible,” “where the hell are they getting that from?,” and “wtf?!” so long as people are going back to the Text.
 
What comes with the game?
300 cards come in a complete deck: 60 Creed Cards and 240 Canon Cards. Expansion decks are in the works.
 
How well do I need to know the Bible to play this game?
Not very. You don’t need to know the Bible intimately to enjoy the game: people with all levels of biblical exposure have fun playing the game. At the bottom of each Canon Card, we provide the relevant passage of Scripture for reference and fighting.
 
Will God send me to hell for playing this game?
 Your God sucks if He/She/It does. Besides, of all the things you’ve done, do you really think this will be the straw that breaks The Camel’s back?
 
What about Shipping and Handling?
 When purchasing, your pledge covers the cost of the game, but not S/H. After the first production is completed, we will contact you about shipping options. We will suggest the cheapest/most timely delivery method to your location, but you are free to choose whatever method you prefer.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Why crowdfunding?</h2>
<p>Designing and sculpting nice miniatures is not cheap. We could go on producing some miniatures at a time, as we have been doing with our late projects, but with your help we can speed up the whole process. Using Indiegogo as a platform to rise funds helps us a lot since we can finance new miniatures, obtain feedback from our customers and it gives us confidence to keep working on. It also offers you the possibility of being part of this project and to get some cool rewards.</p>

<p></p>
<div><br/></div>Planet-X is about releasing the megalomaniac in every player. Nowadays, you can throw birds at pigs. You can farm carrots and crush candies. We offer MUCH better!</div><div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">With us, you will become a Hand of Fate, the maker of destiny for entire solar systems, reshaping the Universe. The Universe has bugs, like unexpected life apparition or displaced asteroids, and you need to reboot the malfunctioning solar systems. This means suppressing biosphere, playing with asteroids as with marbles, ejecting moons, crushing planets into dust. Isn't it a dream job? </span>
</div><div>The game is a physical game, where you will throw stellar objects in order to impact, eject, fragment, annihilate planets. The levels are composed of asteroid belts, planets, planetoïds, moons, suns, black-holes. Other spatial objects are considered, like for example neutron star, wormhole, comets, but we need your support to have the resources to develop them. </div><div>
<p>Most of the levels will feature special missions, like resetting life on a planet, or destroying only ONE planet and leaving the others intact. </p>

</div></div>","What is Planet X ?

Planet-X is about releasing the megalomaniac in every player. Nowadays, you can throw birds at pigs. You can farm carrots and crush candies. We offer MUCH better!
With us, you will become a Hand of Fate, the maker of destiny for entire solar systems, reshaping the Universe. The Universe has bugs, like unexpected life apparition or displaced asteroids, and you need to reboot the malfunctioning solar systems. This means suppressing biosphere, playing with asteroids as with marbles, ejecting moons, crushing planets into dust. Isn't it a dream job? 
The game is a physical game, where you will throw stellar objects in order to impact, eject, fragment, annihilate planets. The levels are composed of asteroid belts, planets, planetoïds, moons, suns, black-holes. Other spatial objects are considered, like for example neutron star, wormhole, comets, but we need your support to have the resources to develop them. 
Most of the levels will feature special missions, like resetting life on a planet, or destroying only ONE planet and leaving the others intact. 
Several projectiles can be unlocked during your progression, for more and more destructive effect, or specific missions, like spreading life in the universe. 
Planet-X includes a gravity system, explosion of planets into pieces, multiple camera angles, advance scoring system with combo.  Every action occurring, like planet explosion, planetary sun-burning and expulsion of the solar system will be included into the scoring. Becoming a top player will require focus, skills, and let's be honest, a dose of luck.

</h2>
<p>""Braincademy"" is a (edutainment-)application, which passes knowledge in a attractive way.</p>
<p>Many children and young people find it hard to learn for school. This can have several reasons, such as a negative reference to school and teachers or 'boring' subject matter.<br/>Many parents decide in these situations to send their children to private lessons or other, for the child, unpleasant solutions. - So the child gets forced to learn.</p>
<p>But most children, however, learn best while having fun or being with friends. So a hands-on approach, in which the child does not feel compelled to cram for school, might work better for most pupils.<br/>So the learners easy forget that they are learning for example for an exam and therefore learn often longer and more persistent.</p>
<h3>
<br/>Target audience:</h3>
<p>The target audience of the application are primarily students who are looking for an attractive way to test what they've learned. But it also could be used for staff and employee taining.<br/>Moreover, even the standard gamer and everyone who loves to play appealing trivia-games, alone or with friends, is addressed. Thats becuse Braincademy is not only tool for learning, it is also a game for in between.</p>
<p><img alt=""Braincademy"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://porzelt.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/leo-round.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Braincademy""/></p>
<h3> Brief description of the application:</h3>
<p>""Braincademy"" is a virtual gameshow in which the candidates are asked questions from preselected areas of knowledge. Unlike other well-known game shows and their game adaptations, players will not be disqualified for an incorrect answer, but at the sum of the accumulated points at the end of each round.</p>
<p>Before each round the user can decide whether he wants to play alone, against a group of friends or a large group of random players.<br/>Depending on the device and the chosen game mode you play together on one device, over the local network or via Internet against each other.</p>
<p>Each player will be ranked based on its previous performances. So, in larger groups, only Players with a similar level of knowledge play against each other. So groups can join together based on their ranking or be assigned automatically in online games.<br/>With this classification, which is symbolized in the form of a player level, each player can also control how they have evolved during the use of the Game.</p>
<p><img alt=""Braincademy"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://porzelt.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/ingame1-en-round.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Braincademy""/></p>
<p>Another part of the application are the various mini-games. Due to the various kinds of tasks used in the mini-games other skills, such as hand-eye coordination, lateral thinking and the development of problem-solving strategies, are also promoted.</p>
<p>Suitable question catalogs for a subject or topic can be created and expanded by the community itself through the braincademy-website. So it can be ensured that for each subject or topic, a questionnaire exists or can be created in a short time by a user.<br/>Moreover, given questionnaires on general knowledge topics will be in the game by its release.</p>
<p><img alt=""separator"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://porzelt.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/path_lines_lila.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""separator""/></p>
<h2>Current Development</h2>
<p>There is currently a working prototype of the application for touch-enabled computer. It was first presented in 2012 at the CeBIT in Hanover to the public and got much attention from the visitors.</p>
<p><img alt=""Braincademy"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://porzelt.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/cebit.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Braincademy""/></p>
<p>In addition to the prototype, there are already several minigames that use touchscreen inputs or motion detection (via Webcam), as well as a dozen funny animated cutscenes. <br/>Even if the current version is 'only' a prototype it already has a full voice output. In addition to an female assistant, who accompanies the player through the menu, it contains a moderator who guides the player through the game.<br/>For this project, the prototype is however completely overhauled and optimized in some places in order to increase the fun and performance.</p>

<h2>Vorstellung</h2>
<p>""Braincademy"" ist eine (Edutainment-)Anwendung, die Wissen auf spielerische Weise weitergibt und Gelerntes festigt.</p>
<p>Vielen Kindern und Jugendlichen fällt es schwer, für die Schule zu lernen. Dies kann verschiedene Gründe haben, wie ein negativer Bezug zu Schule und Lehrern oder Lehrstoff, der nicht ansprechend genug vermittelt wird.<br/>Viele Eltern entschließen sich in diesen Situationen dazu ihre Kinder zu Nachhilfestunden zu schicken, oder andere dem Kind oftmals unangenehme Lösungswege einzuschlagen.</p>
<p>Da die meisten Kinder jedoch mit Spaß, Freude und eventuell Freunden besser lernen können, ist eine spielerische Herangehensweise, bei der das Kind nicht das Gefühl hat, gezwungenermaßen Schulstoff zu pauken, besser.<br/>So vergisst der Lernende schnell, dass er gerade zum Beispiel für eine Klausur lernt, und ist somit oftmals länger und ausdauernder bei der Sache.</p>
<h3>
<br/>Zielgruppe:</h3>
Die Zielgruppe der Anwendung sind in erster Linie Schüler und Studenten, die einen ansprechenden Weg suchen, Ihr gelerntes Wissen zu testen und zu festigen. Aber auch zum Training von Angestellten und als Ergänzung zu Mitarbeiterschulungen soll die Anwendung einsetzbar sein.<br/>Darüber hinaus soll auch der normale Spieler angesprochen werden, der zwischendurch einfach nur zum Zeitvertreib, alleine oder gegen Freunde, ein Quiz-Spiel spielen will.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<img alt=""Braincademy"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://porzelt.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/jani.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Braincademy""/><h3>
<br/>Kurze Beschreibung der Anwendung:</h3>
Bei ""Braincademy"" handelt es sich um eine virtuelle Quiz-Show, bei der den Kandidaten unter anderem Fragen aus vorher ausgewählten Wissensgebieten gestellt werden. Im Gegensatz zu bekannten anderen Spielshows und deren Spieleadaptionen wird der Anwender bei einer falschen Antwort nicht disqualifiziert, sondern an der Summe der erspielten Punkte bewertet.
<p>Dabei kann der Benutzer vor Beginn des Spieles entscheiden, ob er allein, gegen einen Freund oder gegen eine größere Gruppe von Spielern antreten will.<br/>Abhängig vom verwendeten Gerät und nach Wahl des Spielmodus tritt man gemeinsam an einem Gerät über das lokale Netzwerk oder über das Internet gegeneinander an.</p>
<p>Damit in größeren, zusammengewürfelten Gruppen nur Spieler mit einem ähnlichen Wissensstand aufeinandertreffen, wird jeder Spieler anhand seiner vorherigen spielerischen Leistungen bewertet. So können sich Gruppen anhand ihrer Bewertung zusammenschließen oder werden bei Online-Spielen automatisch zugewiesen.<br/>Mit dieser Einstufung des Spielers, die in Form eines Spieler-Levels symbolisiert wird, kann sich jeder Anwender darüber hinaus selbst kontrollieren, wie die eigenen Leistungen sind und wie sie sich entwickelt haben.</p>
<p><img alt=""Braincademy"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://porzelt.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/ingame1-de-round.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Braincademy""/></p>
<p>Einen weiteren Teil der Anwendung stellen die verschiedenen Mini-Spiele dar. Sie dienen dem Spieler als Abwechslung zu den Quiz-Runden. Durch die vielfältigen Aufgabenarten, die in den Mini-Spielen verwendet werden, fördern sie darüber hinaus weitere Fähigkeiten, wie zum Beispiel die Hand-Auge-Koordination, Querdenken oder das Erarbeiten von Problemlösungsstrategien.<br/>Um Quiz-Runden und Mini-Spielen deutlich abzugrenzen, werden diese primär durch andere Bedienweisen gesteuert als die Frage-Runden.</p>
<p>Die passenden Fragenkataloge zu den jeweiligen Fächern/Themen können von der Community selbst über die Webseite erstellt und erweitert werden. Darüber hinaus werden vorgegebene Fragenkataloge zu allgemeinen Wissensthemen bereits zum Release verfügbar sein. Dadurch kann gewährleistet werden, dass für jedes Fach oder Thema ein Fragenkatalog existiert oder in kurzer Zeit erstellt werden kann.</p>
<p><img alt=""separator"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://porzelt.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/path_lines_blue.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""separator""/></p>
<h2>Aktuelle Entwicklung:</h2>
<p>Momentan existiert ein funktionierender Prototyp der Anwendung für touchfähige Computer, der zum ersten Mal 2012 auf der CeBIT in Hannover der Öffentlichkeit zugänglich gemacht wurde.</p>
<p><img alt=""Braincademy"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://porzelt.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/cebit-round.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Braincademy""/></p>
<p>Darüber hinaus existieren bereits diverse Minispiele, die per Touchscreen-Eingaben oder über eine Bewegungserkennung (die percWebcam funktioniert) gesteuert werden, sowie ein Dutzend lustig animierter Zwischensequenzen. Zwar handelt es sich bei der aktuellen Entwicklung 'nur' um einen Prototypen, aber dafür besitzt er bereits eine komplette Sprachausgabe, die neben einer Assistentin, die den Spieler durch das Menü begleitet, auch einem Moderator, der durch das eigentliche Spiel führt, enthält.<br/>Für dieses Projekt wird der Prototyp jedoch generalüberholt und an einigen Stellen optimiert um den Spielspaß zu erhöhen.</p>

Welcome to Braincademy 

""Braincademy"" is a (edutainment-)application, which passes knowledge in a attractive way.
Many children and young people find it hard to learn for school. This can have several reasons, such as a negative reference to school and teachers or 'boring' subject matter.Many parents decide in these situations to send their children to private lessons or other, for the child, unpleasant solutions. - So the child gets forced to learn.
But most children, however, learn best while having fun or being with friends. So a hands-on approach, in which the child does not feel compelled to cram for school, might work better for most pupils.So the learners easy forget that they are learning for example for an exam and therefore learn often longer and more persistent.

Target audience:
The target audience of the application are primarily students who are looking for an attractive way to test what they've learned. But it also could be used for staff and employee taining.Moreover, even the standard gamer and everyone who loves to play appealing trivia-games, alone or with friends, is addressed. Thats becuse Braincademy is not only tool for learning, it is also a game for in between.

 Brief description of the application:
""Braincademy"" is a virtual gameshow in which the candidates are asked questions from preselected areas of knowledge. Unlike other well-known game shows and their game adaptations, players will not be disqualified for an incorrect answer, but at the sum of the accumulated points at the end of each round.
Before each round the user can decide whether he wants to play alone, against a group of friends or a large group of random players.Depending on the device and the chosen game mode you play together on one device, over the local network or via Internet against each other.
Each player will be ranked based on its previous performances. So, in larger groups, only Players with a similar level of knowledge play against each other. So groups can join together based on their ranking or be assigned automatically in online games.With this classification, which is symbolized in the form of a player level, each player can also control how they have evolved during the use of the Game.

Another part of the application are the various mini-games. Due to the various kinds of tasks used in the mini-games other skills, such as hand-eye coordination, lateral thinking and the development of problem-solving strategies, are also promoted.
Suitable question catalogs for a subject or topic can be created and expanded by the community itself through the braincademy-website. So it can be ensured that for each subject or topic, a questionnaire exists or can be created in a short time by a user.Moreover, given questionnaires on general knowledge topics will be in the game by its release.

Current Development
There is currently a working prototype of the application for touch-enabled computer. It was first presented in 2012 at the CeBIT in Hanover to the public and got much attention from the visitors.

In addition to the prototype, there are already several minigames that use touchscreen inputs or motion detection (via Webcam), as well as a dozen funny animated cutscenes. Even if the current version is 'only' a prototype it already has a full voice output. In addition to an female assistant, who accompanies the player through the menu, it contains a moderator who guides the player through the game.For this project, the prototype is however completely overhauled and optimized in some places in order to increase the fun and performance.

Braincademy 


Vorstellung
""Braincademy"" ist eine (Edutainment-)Anwendung, die Wissen auf spielerische Weise weitergibt und Gelerntes festigt.
Vielen Kindern und Jugendlichen fällt es schwer, für die Schule zu lernen. Dies kann verschiedene Gründe haben, wie ein negativer Bezug zu Schule und Lehrern oder Lehrstoff, der nicht ansprechend genug vermittelt wird.Viele Eltern entschließen sich in diesen Situationen dazu ihre Kinder zu Nachhilfestunden zu schicken, oder andere dem Kind oftmals unangenehme Lösungswege einzuschlagen.
Da die meisten Kinder jedoch mit Spaß, Freude und eventuell Freunden besser lernen können, ist eine spielerische Herangehensweise, bei der das Kind nicht das Gefühl hat, gezwungenermaßen Schulstoff zu pauken, besser.So vergisst der Lernende schnell, dass er gerade zum Beispiel für eine Klausur lernt, und ist somit oftmals länger und ausdauernder bei der Sache.

Zielgruppe:
Die Zielgruppe der Anwendung sind in erster Linie Schüler und Studenten, die einen ansprechenden Weg suchen, Ihr gelerntes Wissen zu testen und zu festigen. Aber auch zum Training von Angestellten und als Ergänzung zu Mitarbeiterschulungen soll die Anwendung einsetzbar sein.Darüber hinaus soll auch der normale Spieler angesprochen werden, der zwischendurch einfach nur zum Zeitvertreib, alleine oder gegen Freunde, ein Quiz-Spiel spielen will.
 


Kurze Beschreibung der Anwendung:
Bei ""Braincademy"" handelt es sich um eine virtuelle Quiz-Show, bei der den Kandidaten unter anderem Fragen aus vorher ausgewählten Wissensgebieten gestellt werden. Im Gegensatz zu bekannten anderen Spielshows und deren Spieleadaptionen wird der Anwender bei einer falschen Antwort nicht disqualifiziert, sondern an der Summe der erspielten Punkte bewertet.
Dabei kann der Benutzer vor Beginn des Spieles entscheiden, ob er allein, gegen einen Freund oder gegen eine größere Gruppe von Spielern antreten will.Abhängig vom verwendeten Gerät und nach Wahl des Spielmodus tritt man gemeinsam an einem Gerät über das lokale Netzwerk oder über das Internet gegeneinander an.
Damit in größeren, zusammengewürfelten Gruppen nur Spieler mit einem ähnlichen Wissensstand aufeinandertreffen, wird jeder Spieler anhand seiner vorherigen spielerischen Leistungen bewertet. So können sich Gruppen anhand ihrer Bewertung zusammenschließen oder werden bei Online-Spielen automatisch zugewiesen.Mit dieser Einstufung des Spielers, die in Form eines Spieler-Levels symbolisiert wird, kann sich jeder Anwender darüber hinaus selbst kontrollieren, wie die eigenen Leistungen sind und wie sie sich entwickelt haben.

Einen weiteren Teil der Anwendung stellen die verschiedenen Mini-Spiele dar. Sie dienen dem Spieler als Abwechslung zu den Quiz-Runden. Durch die vielfältigen Aufgabenarten, die in den Mini-Spielen verwendet werden, fördern sie darüber hinaus weitere Fähigkeiten, wie zum Beispiel die Hand-Auge-Koordination, Querdenken oder das Erarbeiten von Problemlösungsstrategien.Um Quiz-Runden und Mini-Spielen deutlich abzugrenzen, werden diese primär durch andere Bedienweisen gesteuert als die Frage-Runden.
Die passenden Fragenkataloge zu den jeweiligen Fächern/Themen können von der Community selbst über die Webseite erstellt und erweitert werden. Darüber hinaus werden vorgegebene Fragenkataloge zu allgemeinen Wissensthemen bereits zum Release verfügbar sein. Dadurch kann gewährleistet werden, dass für jedes Fach oder Thema ein Fragenkatalog existiert oder in kurzer Zeit erstellt werden kann.

Aktuelle Entwicklung:
Momentan existiert ein funktionierender Prototyp der Anwendung für touchfähige Computer, der zum ersten Mal 2012 auf der CeBIT in Hannover der Öffentlichkeit zugänglich gemacht wurde.

Darüber hinaus existieren bereits diverse Minispiele, die per Touchscreen-Eingaben oder über eine Bewegungserkennung (die percWebcam funktioniert) gesteuert werden, sowie ein Dutzend lustig animierter Zwischensequenzen. Zwar handelt es sich bei der aktuellen Entwicklung 'nur' um einen Prototypen, aber dafür besitzt er bereits eine komplette Sprachausgabe, die neben einer Assistentin, die den Spieler durch das Menü begleitet, auch einem Moderator, der durch das eigentliche Spiel führt, enthält.Für dieses Projekt wird der Prototyp jedoch generalüberholt und an einigen Stellen optimiert um den Spielspaß zu erhöhen.

So now that we have that out of the way.....<h3>Whats The Story?</h3><p>It's pretty simple actually. I like to game, and nothing sets off a gaming table like some themed terrain. How many of us remember the old days (yes I'm showing my age) of laying down a green cloth, tossing some books under it to make hills, cutting some blue paper for rivers, then tossing out  our minis for a good old fashion rumble. Well that was fine back in the day, but eventually that just doesn't cut it anymore.</p><p>When I wanted a table for my favorite miniature game, I started looking into the options; and there is quite a few options available. The MDF terrain business has really taken off over the last few years; and there is some impressive work out there. But as I started looking deeper a few things came to mind.</p><p>1. MDF is rather flat and I prefer more textured appearance on my western buildings<br/></p><p>2. The cost. I started adding up the cost for pieces I wanted and quickly realized an entire board was a serious investment.</p><p>This lead to the decision to build my own personal terrain buildings out of foam core and balsa wood. One building lead to another... and before I knew it, I was hooked on the terrain side of the hobby. <br/></p><p>It wasn't long before it hit me ""hey, I can't be the only one that craves a gaming board without breaking the bank."" That and my ego kicked in at the thought of thousands of gamers enjoying their evenings using my designs.</p><p>It became a personal quest for me that no gamer should have to go without terrain.

a success.</b>..</i></p>
<p></p><p><br/></p><h3>How the buildings are made<br/>
</h3><p>For obvious reasons I will no go into detail on the process. The basics:</p><p>Its all starts with a rough concept drawing which I use to hand build a test model using templates Ive made for standard door, window, wall sizes. I use the model to check for design issues I didn't account for during concept as well as gaming issues that could arise. This also allows my to visual finalize dimension measurements that will give a more realistic look. I then transcribe the model into a cleaned up vector image which is converted into a DXF file which can be read by cutting machinery. <br/></p><p>A overseas 3rd party manufacture laminates balsa planks to both sides of a foam core. This provides a cheap and light  yet sturdy panel which the buildings are formed from. They then cut and edge the planks according to the DWF file I design.</p><p>With the basics of the wall now complete they are shipped to my team (also overseas) who applies the trim, glues in the window panes, cements in the magnets and pre-stains the wood.</p><p>They are then boxed and shipped to the US for us to distribute to customers.</p><p>Multistory buildings</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""435"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/OrejDK9oem0?feature=oembed"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><h3>FAQ</h3><p><b></b></p><p><b><b>How does your Indiegogo process work?</b></b></p>Pretty simple.<b> </b>You start by choosing a perk that meets your need. Afterwards, if you would like a add on, pitched roofs, international shipping or the bonus goals unlock and need pay the extra shipping... you have the option to contribute gain, chose donate without perk. Calculate and add the upgrade amount; then please email us with a itemized list of what you upgraded so that we will have a redundant system to track.<p></p><p>At the end of the camping you will receive an email from us (at email address provided to Indiegogo when register for free account) requesting style of building and roof coverings you prefer.<b><br/></b></p><p><br/></p><p><b>Will there be differences between the sample shown and what I receive?</b><br/></p><p>Actually yes there will be a couple differences, only one that you will notice. The sample sent by the 3rd party manufacturer does not have the sign included; each building will come with a sign as shown in concept art.</p><p>After receiving the sample it has been decided to change the depth of the holes made for the magnets as them being flush with the edges did not make as tight of a seal between walls as I would of liked. Also I noticed very slight damage to the sidewalk during shipping and reinforcement has been designed in to prevent.<br/></p><br/><p><b>Why do I have to pay more shipping for bonus  goals?</b></p><p>The price margin on the buildings is extremely small, shipping was calculated with the packages in mind. Due to size of the bonus pieces it is necessary to charge upgraded shipping to prevent us going into the hole.</p><p><b>Will the buildings be the same price after the Indiegogo campaign? </b><br/></p><p>Short answer.. no. Long answer.. noooooooooo. While the prices will always be extremely competitive compared to whats on the market; the margin being offered for this event can not be maintained if I ever want to eat more then top ramen for dinner.<br/></p><p><b>Why is there a minimum purchase required to get bonus goals?</b></p><p>The is significant material cost to the bonus goal rewards. We just can not go into the hole by allowing someone to buy a 2$ outhouse and receive an item worth way more in materials.<br/></p><p><b>Can I buy a perk as a gift?</b></p><p>YES!  What a champ..  If you would like to donate campaign but give the perk to someone as a gift, go through the normal 
process of making a donation in your name.  For billing purposes, this 
action must be in your name.  After the campaign end we will send a message
 to you through  to the email address you provided.  We will 
request your address from you at that time.  Please reply with the 
information of the person who should receive the perk, and we will make 
sure it gets to them.<br/></p><p><b>How do I get my loot the fastest?</b></p><p>You'll notice that perks are listed by waves. The first wave is estimated to be shipped between mid and end of January. Each consecutive wave will follow at one month intervals. To get your perks faster... contribute faster then the next guy ;)<br/></p><p><b>How is shipping cost handled?</b><br/></p><p>Shipping to US addresses is included in perk prices. International customers will need to add an additional 5USD to cover the extra cost.</p><p>*remember if bonus goals are met the rewards are free but shipping is increased.<br/></p><p><b>What is the future business plans?</b><br/></p><p>Original plan was to add latex playing mats and molded accessories (wagon wheels, barrels, and such) to the product line right after perks was completed. Due to insistence of some fan I'm afraid I'll be tarred and feathered if I keep to original plan. So those items will have to wait a bit.<br/></p><p>After the compensation to contributors has been fulfilled; work on the next terrain package will begin. By popular demand... a <b>Victorian City</b> set that is unrivaled by any current product.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>Why did you alter the the scale and dimensions on the concept art?</b></p><p>For any person familiar with the process, a accurate vector image can be converted into a file that modern cutters can read. Bluntly, these files are money for us. While I'm sure the majority of you would never dream of doing such a thing; you always have to keep a eye out for low down varmints.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><b>How can I pay?</b></p><p>Payment is made thru PayPal. Those without a PayPal account can use the service to make a credit card purchase. That being said... PayPal accounts are free and we strongly urge contributors to make use of an actual PayPal account as makes transfer of money and accounting much easier for us, as well saves us on fees.<br/></p><p><b>Do I get anything else for tossing my money at you?</b></p><p>Every contributor will receive a 10% off coupon to be used on a future order (no limitation on size of order)<br/></p><p><b>What happens if initial funding goal is not met?</b></p><p>Materials for Wave 1 perks has already been secured. The contributors price will cover manufacturing and shipping of the perks nearly exact; I will not see a profit till full funding has been reached (when quantity discount for manufacturing kicks in.)</p><p>In the worse case scenario, and funding goal not reach, perks can still be prepared and monetarily I will break even. Contributors receive perks, I earn reputation and my product gets exposure. As an old school Marine; word means more than money, so I still call this a win/win scenario. That being said... join in people!! I can not wait to see screen shots of the paddle boat being used in games to start appearing across the web!

So now that we have that out of the way.....Whats The Story?It's pretty simple actually. I like to game, and nothing sets off a gaming table like some themed terrain. How many of us remember the old days (yes I'm showing my age) of laying down a green cloth, tossing some books under it to make hills, cutting some blue paper for rivers, then tossing out  our minis for a good old fashion rumble. Well that was fine back in the day, but eventually that just doesn't cut it anymore.When I wanted a table for my favorite miniature game, I started looking into the options; and there is quite a few options available. The MDF terrain business has really taken off over the last few years; and there is some impressive work out there. But as I started looking deeper a few things came to mind.1. MDF is rather flat and I prefer more textured appearance on my western buildings2. The cost. I started adding up the cost for pieces I wanted and quickly realized an entire board was a serious investment.This lead to the decision to build my own personal terrain buildings out of foam core and balsa wood. One building lead to another... and before I knew it, I was hooked on the terrain side of the hobby. It wasn't long before it hit me ""hey, I can't be the only one that craves a gaming board without breaking the bank."" That and my ego kicked in at the thought of thousands of gamers enjoying their evenings using my designs.It became a personal quest for me that no gamer should have to go without terrain. This lead to three main goals for a commercial terrain product.1. Cheap2. Easy to store3. Easy to transport to gamesThe AnswerA foam core laminated between two sides of balsa...Cheap? checkToss in some magnets...Storable? check Transportable? checkPo Boys Terrain was born.What We Need & What You GetIn order to drive prices below what you could even build the terrain for yourself; we needed a way to secure materials extremely cheap. Buying bulk, foam core and rare earth magnets (why do they call them rare? I just bought 5000 pretty easily) was not a issue. That left us with the balsa cladding. Using the majority of our start up funds, we was able to purchase the rights to five years of production from a balsa plantation. I then leverage future production with a supplier for current materials.This left a hole in the funds to have sandwiched panels the main walls are constructed from manufactured as well as the cutting/engraving. That is where we turn to you gamers. Funds will be used to pay for the manufacturing of the panels, the cutting/engraving and assembly of the buildings, as well as the cost of having a proper website created.Wait... and what do you get out of it?Black Friday Comes Early For Gamers.Take a look at those perks, can you beat those prices anywhere else?(following examples is early concept art, final vector art not shown to

If the bonus goal is met; every person that contributed 50USD or more will receive a river paddle boat measuring a whopping 38"" x 12"" x11.5"" Think about this; depending on which miniature game you prefer... that could be an entire board in itself.  (an additional 10USD  will be required for shipping)Who am I kidding, here is a little taste... current deck test mockup. What you can do to helpYou want those bonus goal freebies right? Then lets make this happen. We ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about our campaign.I invite you to share
this campaign to a maximum number of people in order to make this Indiegogo
a success...
How the buildings are made
For obvious reasons I will no go into detail on the process. The basics:Its all starts with a rough concept drawing which I use to hand build a test model using templates Ive made for standard door, window, wall sizes. I use the model to check for design issues I didn't account for during concept as well as gaming issues that could arise. This also allows my to visual finalize dimension measurements that will give a more realistic look. I then transcribe the model into a cleaned up vector image which is converted into a DXF file which can be read by cutting machinery. A overseas 3rd party manufacture laminates balsa planks to both sides of a foam core. This provides a cheap and light  yet sturdy panel which the buildings are formed from. They then cut and edge the planks according to the DWF file I design.With the basics of the wall now complete they are shipped to my team (also overseas) who applies the trim, glues in the window panes, cements in the magnets and pre-stains the wood.They are then boxed and shipped to the US for us to distribute to customers.Multistory buildingsFAQHow does your Indiegogo process work?Pretty simple. You start by choosing a perk that meets your need. Afterwards, if you would like a add on, pitched roofs, international shipping or the bonus goals unlock and need pay the extra shipping... you have the option to contribute gain, chose donate without perk. Calculate and add the upgrade amount; then please email us with a itemized list of what you upgraded so that we will have a redundant system to track.At the end of the camping you will receive an email from us (at email address provided to Indiegogo when register for free account) requesting style of building and roof coverings you prefer.Will there be differences between the sample shown and what I receive?Actually yes there will be a couple differences, only one that you will notice. The sample sent by the 3rd party manufacturer does not have the sign included; each building will come with a sign as shown in concept art.After receiving the sample it has been decided to change the depth of the holes made for the magnets as them being flush with the edges did not make as tight of a seal between walls as I would of liked. Also I noticed very slight damage to the sidewalk during shipping and reinforcement has been designed in to prevent.Why do I have to pay more shipping for bonus  goals?The price margin on the buildings is extremely small, shipping was calculated with the packages in mind. Due to size of the bonus pieces it is necessary to charge upgraded shipping to prevent us going into the hole.Will the buildings be the same price after the Indiegogo campaign? Short answer.. no. Long answer.. noooooooooo. While the prices will always be extremely competitive compared to whats on the market; the margin being offered for this event can not be maintained if I ever want to eat more then top ramen for dinner.Why is there a minimum purchase required to get bonus goals?The is significant material cost to the bonus goal rewards. We just can not go into the hole by allowing someone to buy a 2$ outhouse and receive an item worth way more in materials.Can I buy a perk as a gift?YES!  What a champ..  If you would like to donate campaign but give the perk to someone as a gift, go through the normal 
process of making a donation in your name.  For billing purposes, this 
action must be in your name.  After the campaign end we will send a message
 to you through  to the email address you provided.  We will 
request your address from you at that time.  Please reply with the 
information of the person who should receive the perk, and we will make 
sure it gets to them.How do I get my loot the fastest?You'll notice that perks are listed by waves. The first wave is estimated to be shipped between mid and end of January. Each consecutive wave will follow at one month intervals. To get your perks faster... contribute faster then the next guy ;)How is shipping cost handled?Shipping to US addresses is included in perk prices. International customers will need to add an additional 5USD to cover the extra cost.*remember if bonus goals are met the rewards are free but shipping is increased.What is the future business plans?Original plan was to add latex playing mats and molded accessories (wagon wheels, barrels, and such) to the product line right after perks was completed. Due to insistence of some fan I'm afraid I'll be tarred and feathered if I keep to original plan. So those items will have to wait a bit.After the compensation to contributors has been fulfilled; work on the next terrain package will begin. By popular demand... a Victorian City set that is unrivaled by any current product.Why did you alter the the scale and dimensions on the concept art?For any person familiar with the process, a accurate vector image can be converted into a file that modern cutters can read. Bluntly, these files are money for us. While I'm sure the majority of you would never dream of doing such a thing; you always have to keep a eye out for low down varmints.How can I pay?Payment is made thru PayPal. Those without a PayPal account can use the service to make a credit card purchase. That being said... PayPal accounts are free and we strongly urge contributors to make use of an actual PayPal account as makes transfer of money and accounting much easier for us, as well saves us on fees.Do I get anything else for tossing my money at you?Every contributor will receive a 10% off coupon to be used on a future order (no limitation on size of order)What happens if initial funding goal is not met?Materials for Wave 1 perks has already been secured. The contributors price will cover manufacturing and shipping of the perks nearly exact; I will not see a profit till full funding has been reached (when quantity discount for manufacturing kicks in.)In the worse case scenario, and funding goal not reach, perks can still be prepared and monetarily I will break even. Contributors receive perks, I earn reputation and my product gets exposure. As an old school Marine; word means more than money, so I still call this a win/win scenario. That being said... join in people!! I can not wait to see screen shots of the paddle boat being used in games to start appearing across the web! That can only happen with your support.How do we contact you?While the official website is being created you can contact us thru the current facebook page https://www.facebook.com/PB.Terrain.

MK1881 team is composed of many experienced artists all with several years of experience in their fields that range from design, to classic and 3D sculpting and painting.  We work only with high quality casting facilities and use only top quality materials for our creations.

Why crowd funding?</strong></p><p>
At MK1881 we have done extensive research and tests to deliver only very high quality miniatures. Designing, sculpting and printing these miniatures is quite expensive. We are looking for your contribution to speed up the printing and casting process and cover some of the costs for the design and production of special characters for this fantasy football team.<br/><br/>

</b><br/>After several collaborations and tests we selected a selected group of professional 3D sculpting artists and 3D printing companies. Merging the experience in traditional sculpting techniques of our team with the new technologies of 3D sculpting and rapid prototyping we are able to produce top quality miniatures. Some examples can be seen in the video below.<br/>

We already have all the 3D models necessary to print and put in production the 
team.<br/><br/>
A lot of time was spent to make sure models had less separated parts as 
possible, and where this was not possible we are making sure that the junctions 
are done at art to ease assembly and increase the strength of them. As a player 
I hate when my nicely painted models looses his arm during a game, and as a 
modeler I hate to spend hours trying to figure out where a specific piece goes 
or attaches. </p><p>

MK1881 Miniatures is the new miniature line from Maki Games, featuring high quality miniatures mainly suitable for fantasy football games and more. We offer innovative design and very high quality casts. MK1881 team is composed of many experienced artists all with several years of experience in their fields that range from design, to classic and 3D sculpting and painting.  We work only with high quality casting facilities and use only top quality materials for our creations. 
	All miniatures are made with lead free metal.
MK1881 temporary page can be found here:
http://www.mk1881.comMK1881 work progress can be followed on our FB page:
https://www.facebook.com/mk1881

Why crowd funding?
At MK1881 we have done extensive research and tests to deliver only very high quality miniatures. Designing, sculpting and printing these miniatures is quite expensive. We are looking for your contribution to speed up the printing and casting process and cover some of the costs for the design and production of special characters for this fantasy football team.

Want even more MK1881 miniatures.. look at our Honos campaign:

Our models:
After several collaborations and tests we selected a selected group of professional 3D sculpting artists and 3D printing companies. Merging the experience in traditional sculpting techniques of our team with the new technologies of 3D sculpting and rapid prototyping we are able to produce top quality miniatures. Some examples can be seen in the video below.



We already have all the 3D models necessary to print and put in production the 
team.
A lot of time was spent to make sure models had less separated parts as 
possible, and where this was not possible we are making sure that the junctions 
are done at art to ease assembly and increase the strength of them. As a player 
I hate when my nicely painted models looses his arm during a game, and as a 
modeler I hate to spend hours trying to figure out where a specific piece goes 
or attaches. 




The basic perks:
Dice perk added: 6.00€ for 3 dice (for supporters) and 9.00€ for 3 dice (for non supporters) Special Character Perk, 
special character to empower and differentiate your existing team.
This perk will give you access to one each of the special that will be unlocked 
in the campaign. At the end you will choose the ones you want. 
9€ perk is for the model only including shipping worldwide, if you have bought 
any perk before this it will be 6€.




12 model team, enough to play the 
majority of Fantasy Football games on the market. 

Bloodbo

16 model team, 
for the enthusiast gamer and collector who wants them all. 


Stretch 
goals:
The dice are unlocked. These will be available to current pledgers (not for 
Support Us level) also valid if you pledge on our other camapign.
with a 6.00€ add-on option. Or 9.00€ for non backers including shipping.The free thematic limited edition ball has been unlocked. Free with every team of 11 or more players. King level gets x5 balls.
The field will be available in hard foam or soft version and will be 38€ each.

Special character 2 - Hubris 



Special character 3 - Eldrid



Special character 4 - Horken (WIP)




Special character 5 - Irtacka (WIP)

done and visible, the printing facility was chosen and selected for his highest 
printing standard, test models where done to make sure the materials and size 
are adequate to obtain the highest standard product. We have already ordered and

“World Basketball Manager” story goes many-many years in the past.

team and clubs have won many international titles, we always wanted to find and
play a basketball management game.

<h3>What is On The Slopes?</h3>
<p><strong>On The Slopes </strong>is a skiing-themed family-style board game where you and up to three friends race around a mountain to be the first to visit every lodge.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476080745/fvkpn8veth2g9i8w8li4.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>On The Slopes is a FINALIST in the 2016 Hasbro Game Design Challenge!</h3>
<p><strong>On The Slopes</strong> has been selected as <strong>one of five finalists </strong>in the 2016 Hasbro Game Design Challenge!</p>
<p>We are running a crowdfunding campaign and need at least 100 backers in order to win the competition.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>How to Play On The Slopes</strong></h3>
<p>A game of <strong>On The Slopes</strong> takes about 45 minutes, and you can learn to play in under three minutes!  Each player is a skier (or snowboarder) racing around a mountain, trying to be the first one to visit all the lodges to collect all your stones.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476046583/k80uj9o9cz8gg5dcjkc1.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>On your turn, you have three actions, which you can use to go up a lift, ski down a run, or pick up a stone.  But runs and lifts only work in one direction, so you need to keep that in mind as you plan your route for the day.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476044790/edkolh7azojk0vlblfum.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Whenever you pick up a stone, you also get a Snow Card, which can give you benefits like extra action tokens or a one-time-only ability.  Some Snow Cards let you help or hinder other players.</p>

<h3><strong>FAQ</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Question: Do I need to know how to ski or snowboard to play On The Slopes?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>No; we have played this game many times with people who haven’t even seen snow.</p>
<p><strong>Question: Can you play On The Slopes while skiing or snowboarding?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Possibly. We have brought the game on ski trips before, but have never actually played the game while skiing.</p>
<p><strong>Question: Is On The Slopes an accurate representation of skiing or snowboarding?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>While skiing or snowboarding, each path is actually one direction, since you can only go up lifts and down runs. And you can choose to go on easy slopes or take harder ones.  Also, when you are out on the slopes for real, it’s fun to try to cover the entire mountain or as much as you can in the shortest amount of time possible; hence visiting every lodge.  We use stones in the game as a way to keep track of how many lodges you have visited.</p>
<p><strong>Question: I’m not really into boardgaming.  Will I like this?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>We’ve playtested <strong>On The Slopes</strong> with many non-gamers, and they really get into it.  It’s super-easy to teach, and everyone immediately understands what they are trying to do.  There’s definitely strategy to the game, but the Snow Cards and Wipeout Cards offer just enough unpredictability and luck that even a beginner has a good chance of winning the game.   We do recommend that beginners start with the basic game, and introduce the special characters after playing it a few times.</p>
<p><strong>Question: Who did the artwork?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Artwork and visual design for <strong>On The Slopes </strong>were done by Jayme Kalpin (jayme_kalpin@hotmail.com) and Sean Lautenschlager (seanlautenschlager@gmail.com).</p>
<p><strong>Question: How much is shipping?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>We will ship your copy of <strong>On The Slopes</strong> anywhere in the world.  Shipping costs are as follows:</p>

</div></div>","What is On The Slopes?
On The Slopes is a skiing-themed family-style board game where you and up to three friends race around a mountain to be the first to visit every lodge.


 
On The Slopes is a FINALIST in the 2016 Hasbro Game Design Challenge!
On The Slopes has been selected as one of five finalists in the 2016 Hasbro Game Design Challenge!
We are running a crowdfunding campaign and need at least 100 backers in order to win the competition.
 
How to Play On The Slopes
A game of On The Slopes takes about 45 minutes, and you can learn to play in under three minutes!  Each player is a skier (or snowboarder) racing around a mountain, trying to be the first one to visit all the lodges to collect all your stones.

 
On your turn, you have three actions, which you can use to go up a lift, ski down a run, or pick up a stone.  But runs and lifts only work in one direction, so you need to keep that in mind as you plan your route for the day.

 
Whenever you pick up a stone, you also get a Snow Card, which can give you benefits like extra action tokens or a one-time-only ability.  Some Snow Cards let you help or hinder other players.

 
When going down runs, you can choose between easy green runs, intermediate blue runs, or advanced or expert black diamond runs.  The more difficult runs are faster, but be careful: You might fall and have to take a Wipeout Card, which can cause bad things to happen.

 
If you are the first one to get to a lodge, you can pick up an action token, which gives you an extra action… or you can save your action tokens and use them to re-roll bad die rolls.

 
Advanced players can play with special characters that give each player a unique ability they can use throughout the game.

 
What’s in the Box
On The Slopes includes the following components:

1 high-quality game board with map of mountain
4 pawns
48 stones
15 bus tickets
30 action tokens
Snow Card deck
Wipeout Card deck
2 reference mats
7 special character mats
1 rulebook
1 die
And lots of fun!

<h3>Funding Campaign Top Priorities</h3>
<p>Salute WWIIOL community members! We have some big objectives we're requesting your assistance to make some great progress for the game. Here is the short list of priorities that this funding campaign is designed to support:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a whole new server base for WWII Online.</li>
<li>Renew essential software for game development.</li>
<li>Obtain a newer version of SpeedTree to improve graphics of environmental objects.</li>
<li>Support the development of the current Roadmap.</li>
<li>Enhance marketing reach to obtain new players.</li>
</ol>
<p>We have 40 days to obtain the goal of $40,000 (USD) which will amplify all of these efforts.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567806313/nco4kszwurxtcxwlx9nh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>A whole new server base for WWII Online:</strong> Cornered Rat Software is taking WWII Online's servers to the latest standards in an all-new location! Here's some short notes of how your support will be put into action:</p>
<ul>
<li>New powerful servers with more horsepower, energy efficiency and remote management.</li>
<li>New Gigabit router, switches and cables for maximum throughput.</li>
<li>New Gigabit internet service provider, with emphasis on improved latency for North American <strong>and</strong> European customers.</li>
<li>New remote power management power strips, with increased monitoring utilities.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>This new server base will be setup in Portland Oregon, where Cornered Rat Software HQ is, and the old servers in Dallas will be decommissioned. Fortunately we will be able to spare a couple of these servers from past funding events as these are newer and meet the criteria we're looking for.</i></p>
<p><i>Many of our technical personnel now reside on the West Coast which will reduce logistics and increase proactive measures taken to ensure optimal health of the servers. Oregon also has zero sales tax and a new deal has been worked out to reduce monthly expenses to operate WWIIOL.</i></p>
<p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567806578/l1ancv4obdi7qupaqvie.jpg"" src=""""/></i></p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>Game Software Renewal(s):</strong> Developing WWII Online requires us to upkeep some critical software that gives our production team (producers and artists) the tools our game depends on:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Creator:</strong> Used for everything to develop art assets (vehicles, terrain / environmentals, etc).</li>
<li>
<strong>Granny:</strong> Used for everything related to infantry (models, animations, etc).</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567806641/nwmbxzk3ygjdm2hkzya2.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>We're always evaluating ways to enhance WWII Online's graphics, and obtaining the SpeedTree SDK version 8 is one big way to do that. SpeedTree currently manages all of the:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trees, bushes and foliage. </li>
<li>By upgrading, we can introduce efficient, newer assets that are realistic (meaning they move and cast proper, low intensity shadows).</li>
<li>SpeedTree runs on the GPU, where WWIIOL runs on the CPU, so this will reduce any conflict on performance / efficiency of the game - providing you have a decent Graphics Processor.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Support the current Dev Roadmap: </strong>There are so many exciting things we have on the current Roadmap and your support will help push them forward. Here's a quick list of what they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>64-bit applications (75% completed, <i>in progress</i>).</li>
<li>Integrated voice comms.</li>
<li>Vehicles to receive the load out option (base functionality obtained).</li>
<li>Server tracked bombs.</li>
<li>Upgrading speed tree technology.</li>
<li>New / improved user interface <i>(in progress).</i>

<li>Upgrading TrackIR technology (in progress).</li>
<li>Connection / networking improvements via code <i>(in progress).</i>

<li>Infantry controls (mouse sensitivity).</li>
<li>HUD markers for mission leaders.</li>
<li>Junkers 88 A-4 (Axis medium fast bomber). <i>(in progress)</i>

<p><strong>Help us enhance marketing / player acquisition: </strong>We want to put an end to <i>""I wish I would have heard of this game before!""</i> and accelerate our marketing efforts.

New Gigabit router, switches and cables for maximum throughput.
New Gigabit internet service provider, with emphasis on improved latency for North American and European customers.
New remote power management power strips, with increased monitoring utilities.

This new server base will be setup in Portland Oregon, where Cornered Rat Software HQ is, and the old servers in Dallas will be decommissioned. Fortunately we will be able to spare a couple of these servers from past funding events as these are newer and meet the criteria we're looking for.
Many of our technical personnel now reside on the West Coast which will reduce logistics and increase proactive measures taken to ensure optimal health of the servers. Oregon also has zero sales tax and a new deal has been worked out to reduce monthly expenses to operate WWIIOL.


Game Software Renewal(s): Developing WWII Online requires us to upkeep some critical software that gives our production team (producers and artists) the tools our game depends on:


Creator: Used for everything to develop art assets (vehicles, terrain / environmentals, etc).

Granny: Used for everything related to infantry (models, animations, etc).



We're always evaluating ways to enhance WWII Online's graphics, and obtaining the SpeedTree SDK version 8 is one big way to do that. SpeedTree currently manages all of the:

Trees, bushes and foliage. 
By upgrading, we can introduce efficient, newer assets that are realistic (meaning they move and cast proper, low intensity shadows).
SpeedTree runs on the GPU, where WWIIOL runs on the CPU, so this will reduce any conflict on performance / efficiency of the game - providing you have a decent Graphics Processor.



Support the current Dev Roadmap: There are so many exciting things we have on the current Roadmap and your support will help push them forward. Here's a quick list of what they are:

64-bit applications (75% completed, in progress).
Integrated voice comms.
Vehicles to receive the load out option (base functionality obtained).
Server tracked bombs.
Upgrading speed tree technology.
New / improved user interface (in progress).

Upgrading TrackIR technology (in progress).
Connection / networking improvements via code (in progress).

Infantry controls (mouse sensitivity).
HUD markers for mission leaders.
Junkers 88 A-4 (Axis medium fast bomber). (in progress)

Wellington (Allied medium-heavy bomber).
Early War Truck (SPAAs). (in progress)

City Blocks (major urban areas). (in progress)

<h2>WE DID IT!<br/><br/>
</h2>
<h3>Sword of the Stars: The Pit is an Indiegogo Success Story.</h3>
<p>A small team of dedicated developers. A small group of generous supporters. Our campaign did not raise the complete budget of 60K required to complete a game from start to finish, but between the Flexible Funded Indiegogo campaign and the contributions to the game's <a href=""http://sots-thepit.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Sword of the Stars: The Pit Website"">dedicated website</a>, we raised enough money to continue our work.</p>
<p>A successful Exclusive Beta test for our supporters ran from December of 2012 to mid-February of 2013, when the game was finally ready for release.</p>
<p>The team had to make some sacrifices, but we have delivered a fun, addictive game which had 30% more content than we had projected, and we've already shipped a variety of quality Perks that our supporters have really enjoyed.</p>

Both <em>The Pit</em> and<em> FTL</em> nail their goal of making exploration entertaining. My first thought after dying isn’t my normal “some-variation-of-damn-it!” but instead “one more try!”<br/><br/>And that’s really the highest praise I can give a game.""</h3>

<p><em><strong>Sword of the Stars: The Pit</strong></em> is a fun, fast, light-hearted action RPG, in the tradition of <em>Rogue</em> and other old school dungeon-diving games.</p>
<p>We've been working on it for a few months, and the game is presently at the Alpha phase. The goal of this campaign is to push the game forward to its Beta state.<em><br/></em></p>

<h2>What Is <em>The Pit</em>?<em><br/></em>
</h2>
<p><em>The Pit</em> is short for <em>The Pit of the Bloodweaver</em>. In this game, you play a brave Human soldier exploring a multi-level underground lab facility. The place was built and abandoned years ago by the Bloodweaver, an alien super-genius with delusions of godhood. He was the ultimate mad scientist, and The Pit was his favorite box of tinker toys.</p>
<p>As you break through locked doors, open storage containers, dodge traps and evade security systems, you'll also have to contend with a variety of crazy foes. <em>The Pit</em> is full of the mutants, monsters and minions that the enemy left behind.</p>
<p>They're hungry, and you look like lunch.</p>
<p> </p>

<h2>Why Make This Game?</h2>
<p><em>The Pit</em> came out of our love of dungeon-diving and retro-style games. Roguelikes are the low hanging fruit of the “small game” market at the moment, but any genre can be made new and fun if you give it the right spin.</p>
<p><em>The Pit</em> takes the usual Kerberos approach to the classics: we pay tribute to the great games of the past, without actually cloning them.  Instead, we wanted to reimagine the Good Old Days through the lens of modern gameplay.</p>
<p>With <em>The Pit</em>, we deliver retro graphics, but give you the levelling, ammo, crafting and skills of a true dungeon dive. And of course, we set the action in our favourite playground, the SotSVerse!</p>
<p>And so <em>The Pit</em> was born.</p>
<p><img alt=""I Like My Hivers Extra Crispy"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sots-thepit.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/pagebreak_02.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""I Like My Hivers Extra Crispy""/></p>
<h2><strong>Why You Will Love This Game</strong></h2>
<p><em>The Pit</em> is a game is for everyone who wants to smile, snarl, chuckle and swear their way through play sessions ranging from 10 minutes to 3 hours.</p>
<p>The game sticks with the traditional <em>Rogue</em> model. It's all about how long you can live and how deep into <em>The Pit</em> you can go, but it is combined with gameplay and a backdrop you can seriously sink your teeth into. </p>
<p>From the action RPG perspective, your character will gain in levels and skill as you defeat more opponents and complete more tasks.</p>
<p>Despite being quick and fun, you'll have to sweat to keep your Character alive and you'll be identifying with the Li'l Dude just enough that it stings when he gets eaten by a Rabid Moon Bear.</p>

<p> <em>The Pit</em> was released on February 21, 2013. The finished game is now available for download.</p>

<h3>Do we have Stretch Goals? Yes, we do!</h3>
<p>Although we did not reach our initial funding goal during this campaign, we have never given up on our three preliminary Stretch Goals for The Pit. The first is the Mind Games Expansion.</p>

<div>
<p>The Mind Games Expansion will be a nice bundle of new DLC content for <em>The Pit</em>, complete with new levels, a new Character to play, new monsters, items, and other cool mechanics. If we reach this Stretch Goal, all Supporters of this campaign--including those who picked up Just the Game at the $10 Level--will receive the Mind Games Expansion for free.</p>
<p>People who buy the game later will have to pay extra for expansions.</p>

<p><img alt=""The Plan banner"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sots-thepit.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/section_titles_05.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""The Plan banner""/></p>
<h3>We Have a Plan to Become Fully Independent</h3>
<p>The Plan has both Short term and Long Term Goals.</p>
<p>The Short Term Goal is simple. We wanted to make <em>The Pit.</em> It is a fun little game, and we hope that you will enjoy it.</p>
<p>The Long Term Goal is more complicated. We need to find a new way of making games in general. Our player base has been actively trying to support our studio for years, by buying our games and expansions.</p>
<p>Sadly, in the eight years that we have been making games, not a penny of that support has EVER reached us directly. The old system just isn't working well for us, for a variety of reasons, and we aren't alone in this: there are a lot of developers feeling the crunch.</p>
<p>Needless to say, in order to keep doing what we love to do and still survive, we have to start doing things in new ways.</p>
<h3>We Want More Control</h3>
<p>It is time to move forward on our own.</p>
<p>We want more control over the complete life cycle of our games, from funding and early development to release. We want to be able to keep up product support long after our games hit the market.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this, we need your help.</p>
<h3>We Want to Connect</h3>
<p>We have always been one of the most accessible game dev teams in the business. Now, thanks to sites like Indiegogo and Kickstarter, our connection to our players can have a lot more impact on the health of our studio and the direction of our games.</p>
<p>A committed group of supporters can make amazing things happen. <em>The Pit</em> is living proof of that.</p>
<p>You can decide what games are made, and how much content those games will have.</p>
<h3><strong><em>The Pit</em> Is Part of the Plan</strong></h3>
<div>Our plan is to start small and work our way to bigger things.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We want to develop a catalog of games which are completely independent and self-published. We're starting with small projects, games with smaller budgets and faster turn-around times.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Over time we'll build up to bigger, more ambitious games. Small projects like <em>The Pit</em> will teach us what we need to know about publishing and distributing our own games and merchandise.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Once we have a few successful self-published games under our belts, we'll be ready to launch something bigger and more involved, like <em>Fort Zombie 2</em> or <em>Northstar</em>.</div>

Sword of the Stars: The Pit is an Indiegogo Success Story.
A small team of dedicated developers. A small group of generous supporters. Our campaign did not raise the complete budget of 60K required to complete a game from start to finish, but between the Flexible Funded Indiegogo campaign and the contributions to the game's dedicated website, we raised enough money to continue our work.
A successful Exclusive Beta test for our supporters ran from December of 2012 to mid-February of 2013, when the game was finally ready for release.
The team had to make some sacrifices, but we have delivered a fun, addictive game which had 30% more content than we had projected, and we've already shipped a variety of quality Perks that our supporters have really enjoyed.
 

Sword of the Stars: The Pit was released on Gamer's Gate on February 21, 2013.
The game was released initially on Gamer's Gate. It remained steadily in the Top 10 selling games on the site for the first ten days, and remains in the Top 20.

The Pit was released on Steam on March 8, 2013.
It has been in the Top 50 since release, rising to a peak of Number 5 on the Top Seller's list in its opening weekend.
The Players Are Having Fun!
To see what the buyers of The Pit think of their purchase, please scroll down to the bottom of the game's Product Page on Gamer's Gate to see their scores and reviews.
There is also a lively discussion on the Community Hub Page for the game on Steam.
Both Steam and Gamer's Gate have a free demo available.
 

 
""I like a good Roguelike and so far I’m liking The Pit an awful lot.""
--Dragonchasers
 
""All in all, the game is great fun if you’re into roguelike games. The layouts are always random. The classes can be leveled up in various ways. No two play-throughs are alike and you’ll find yourself dying many different ways as you progress. The Pit delivers a solid experience and should be a must buy for fans of the genre. And remember, in space, no one can hear you scream as you die for the forty-second time.""
--Twonkhammer
 
""The Pit compares favorably with another modern (and better known) Roguelike, FTL: Faster Than Light. As in FTL, you will die. A lot. Even after playing 40+ hours on the easiest difficulty, I never came close to seeing the bottom of the Pit at level 30. However, I also never felt frustrated. And I am very easily frustrated. Both The Pit and FTL nail their goal of making exploration entertaining. My first thought after dying isn’t my normal “some-variation-of-damn-it!” but instead “one more try!”And that’s really the highest praise I can give a game.""
--Express Bus to Hell
 
""Taking us back to the old school era of Rogue with a fresh lick of paint on a 2D canvas, this fast action turn-based RPG initially looks trivial in the first minutes of play but quickly reveals itself as a veritable alternative for gamers looking for quick-burst of RPG play sessions.""
--Awesome Games
 
""The Pit is a joy to play but at the same time something so brutally difficult it just bends you over and paddles your arse like you’re a freshman in Dazed and Confused.""
--Pixelbedlam
 
""Are you a sucker for punishment? If the answer is yes, Sword of the Stars: The Pit is the game you have been longing for!""
...the witty commentary from the voice actors in-game is fantastic. They add a note of sarcasm and lighthearted fun into the otherwise frustrating mix. They always have something to say, even if it’s Travis exclaiming, “Let’s try shootin’ it” when an attempt at Lock-picking fails, or “Travis one; monsters zero” after eradicating a mob of enemies. You’ll find yourself associating with the characters more often, or having a semi love-hate relationship when they comment on how bad you are at the game, or how awesome they are when an attempt at a Security Bypass or Repair succeeds.""
--Gamer Living
 
""There’s a ton of fun to be had here and it definitely has the addictive “one more go” quality that you want to be there for this kind of thing. But over the course of my games- an awful lot of which were played that first night that I got it- I began to feel that I was in something resembling an abusive relationship. But it keeps telling me that it loves me, and sometimes I love it too.""
--No High Scores
 
""Ooo, hello. Yeah, this is getting really really bad. Let's re-load the pistol and then use a med-kit--ow ow ow ow ow, ow ow ow, ow ow!""
--Total Biscuit, WTF is Sword of the Stars: The Pit?
 
""The Pit makes no accommodations for newbies. This is a hardcore roguelike and as such it is sure to please fans. There is such a wealth to do and upgrade that it never feels like you’re [pl]aying the same game twice. Levels only grow larger and tougher the further you descend. This is a game that requires tons of time and dedication to make it to the bottom. Players who enjoy this sort of thing will find themselves spending hours trying to build characters just right so their next mission will succeed. Sword of the Stars: The Pit is just the game for those roguelike fans who enjoy statistics and unfriendly aliens.""
--Game Podunk
 
""The Pit is a roguelike both relatively accessible and hard as nails. There’s something there for newbies getting into roguelikes, veterans who want an interesting setting plus a solid game, and fans of the Sword of the Stars universe.""
--Techzwn
 

Don't Panic!
You can still support The Pit for a few more days, until February 28, 2013, if you pick up one of our two upcoming Lore books for the Sword of the Stars universe. You can continue to follow the game's development and get notice of Updates and upcoming Expansions by visiting the game's dedicated website.
We will try to keep you posted on how The Pit is doing, now that the game has been released.
Thank you once again to all of the wonderful folks who stepped up to support this game and our team.

""BUY THIS GAME. Hey guys; I don't think I've ever done a celebrity-endorsement of an Indiegogo project until now, but I'm going to do it today.""
--RPGpundit
""Sword of the Stars: The Pit - A perfect mix of old school retro art combined with new school game mechanics in this action/RPG. Swords of Stars takes me back to the games of yore that I loved so much and I cannot wait to play this game."" 
 --John Vaskis, Indiegogo Games Guru!
""I had a blast with my time in The Pit, and highly encourage everyone to give it a shot.""
--James Barry, Colony of Gamers
""I immediately lost myself to inward-looking concerns about getting my lockpicking skill up, finding enough food to stay alive (in addition to replenishing health) and frantically switching to melee attacks to conserve ammo.""
--Alec Meer, Rock Paper Shotgun
""We're very excited to be a part of The Pit, both during this campaign period and throughout development. We’re life-long gamers at Power Up. We strive for the modern ‘standard of awesome’ in all our work, but we’ve got a soft spot for the retro vibe. We jumped at the chance to be involved with a game like The Pit.”
--Kevin Regamey, Power Up Audio
 
Sword of the Stars: The Pit is a fun, fast, light-hearted action RPG, in the tradition of Rogue and other old school dungeon-diving games.
We've been working on it for a few months, and the game is presently at the Alpha phase. The goal of this campaign is to push the game forward to its Beta state.
With your support, we'd like to make this game our first self-published title.

What Is The Pit?

The Pit is short for The Pit of the Bloodweaver. In this game, you play a brave Human soldier exploring a multi-level underground lab facility. The place was built and abandoned years ago by the Bloodweaver, an alien super-genius with delusions of godhood. He was the ultimate mad scientist, and The Pit was his favorite box of tinker toys.
As you break through locked doors, open storage containers, dodge traps and evade security systems, you'll also have to contend with a variety of crazy foes. The Pit is full of the mutants, monsters and minions that the enemy left behind.
They're hungry, and you look like lunch.
 

TIME TO SADDLE UP, SPACE MONKEYS!
You can download a Six Level Playable Demo from GAMER'S GATE.
This demo of The Pit provides you with an introductory tutorial and a chance to fight your way down into the first 6 levels of the game! But there’s still a lot more of the game that will only be found in the full version;

2 More Characters to choose from… the Marine and the Scout, each with their own unique advantages!

Level your character up as you dive down into 24 more levels, each one bigger than the last!

Dozens more enemies drawn from the SotSverse!

Dozens and dozens of additional weapons and armors with a variety of special effects, including flamethrowers, rocket launchers, plasma cannons and powered Brawler armor!

50 more items to discover, ranging from the familiar to the ancient exotic tech.

Dozens of room types containing a host of exotic devices to help and hinder the player

And while the demo will try and kill you in many fiendish ways, the final game will always have more poisons, traps, diseases and monsters.
 

 

Why Make This Game?
The Pit came out of our love of dungeon-diving and retro-style games. Roguelikes are the low hanging fruit of the “small game” market at the moment, but any genre can be made new and fun if you give it the right spin.
The Pit takes the usual Kerberos approach to the classics: we pay tribute to the great games of the past, without actually cloning them.  Instead, we wanted to reimagine the Good Old Days through the lens of modern gameplay.
With The Pit, we deliver retro graphics, but give you the levelling, ammo, crafting and skills of a true dungeon dive. And of course, we set the action in our favourite playground, the SotSVerse!
And so The Pit was born.

Why You Will Love This Game
The Pit is a game is for everyone who wants to smile, snarl, chuckle and swear their way through play sessions ranging from 10 minutes to 3 hours.
The game sticks with the traditional Rogue model. It's all about how long you can live and how deep into The Pit you can go, but it is combined with gameplay and a backdrop you can seriously sink your teeth into. 
From the action RPG perspective, your character will gain in levels and skill as you defeat more opponents and complete more tasks.
Despite being quick and fun, you'll have to sweat to keep your Character alive and you'll be identifying with the Li'l Dude just enough that it stings when he gets eaten by a Rabid Moon Bear.
Game Features
 The Pit was released on February 21, 2013. The finished game is now available for download.
Here's the Feature List we promised on release in October 2012:

3 Characters to choose from…Marine, Scout and Engineer!


Go up levels and improve your skills as you try and find a way to survive the depths.

30 Levels of ancient evil science between you and the cure!


Dozens of enemies drawn from the SotSverse!

Over 30 weapons and armors with a variety of special effects including flamethrowers, rocket launchers, plasma cannons and powered Brawler armor!

Randomized augmentation effects to make each game unique.

Crafting lets you make special items from bits and pieces of your enemies.

Over 60 items to discover, ranging from the familiar to the ancient exotic tech.

Dozens of room types containing a host of exotic devices to help and hinder the player.

Many fiendish ways to die including poisoning, disease, traps, radiation, starvation and of course…MONSTERS.

Supporters at the $75 level receive Early Beta access to the game, plus a full-color Kerberos Concept Art Calendar for 2013 as a thank-you for their support.
The Kerberos Calendar features 13 months of concept art, including sneak previews of unannounced projects. Exclusive swag for supporters of this campaign. Kerberos Insiders Only!
BONUS BOOK: Thanks to Supporter Feedback (and lack of space in the main Lore Book!), we decided to add a bonus book to this Perk!
Black Section: The Complete Files is an over-sized softcover art-and-lore book, focused exclusively on the Random Encounters, Grand Menaces and Mysteries of the Sword of the Stars universe. The book will have full-color plates, fiction tidbits and hazard data on many of the classic encounters of Sword of the Stars and Sword of the Stars 2: Lords of Winter. A must for fans of the SotSverse! It is slated for delivery in April of 2013.

Please add $10 for International Shipping outside the USA and Canada.


The Pit Premium Lore Book
One of the special items created for this campaign is a premium Sword of the Stars Lore Book. Collected for the first time in print are over a hundred full-color illustrations, tidbits of background fiction, interviews with artists and designers on the Sword of the Stars series, and never-before-seen internal concept art related not only to The Pit, but to all the games in the Sword of the Stars franchise.
The first hundred of these special edition hardbacks will be personally signed by the Lead Writer of the Sword of the Stars series, Arinn Dembo, and the in-house concept artists for the series, Chris Gerspacher, Ken Lee and John Yakimow.
The Premium Lore Book is slated for delivery in April of 2013.


The Sword of the Stars 2 Poster Pack!
We created seven special edition schematic posters for this campaign, representing the ships for all seven of the playable Factions which presently exist for Sword of the Stars 2: Lords of Winter. Each poster is 18 x 24 inches, printed with a lovely matte finish on high quality poster paper.
The Schematics for the Human, Hiver, Tarka, Liir, Zuul and Morrigi ships could be picked up one or two at a time at the $60 level, but 7th Poster was a Special Surprise only available to supporters at the $200 level.

The Ultimate Collector's Pack

This Perk was a package which included Early Beta Access and all the swag for this campaign, including:
- the Repensum bumper sticker - 2 Sol Force Service Mugs - 2 Campaign T-shirts - the Kerberos Concept Art Calendar - the Premium Lore Book, signed by the Lead Writer and Concept Artists for Sword of the Stars - and the Complete Poster Pack, complete with all 7 ship schematics.

True Believer: Become a V.I.P.
Supporters at the $1000 level will receive a copy of every Kerberos Productions release for the next ten years! Every game and its expansions will be yours. In addition, we will send 2 Campaign t-shirts of your choice, and make a special VIP card for you, printed with your name.
Holders of the Kerberos VIP card will be granted free entry to any Kerberos public event, including those that would normally be Press Only. They will also have the right to cast a vote when choosing the company's next project.
 


Come to Vancouver and Visit Kerberos!
This package included all the benefits of the True Believer Perk, but you can also come on down for two days this December and party with Kerberos!
The X-Mas Perk package will cover two hotel nights in Vancouver, dinner with the Kerberos Team, a tour of our Mount Pleasant studio, and a day of board-gaming and sci-fi movies with Mecron and the Pit Crew.
Airfare and other expenses were not included in this package.
 

 
Do we have Stretch Goals? Yes, we do!
Although we did not reach our initial funding goal during this campaign, we have never given up on our three preliminary Stretch Goals for The Pit. The first is the Mind Games Expansion.
 


The Mind Games Expansion will be a nice bundle of new DLC content for The Pit, complete with new levels, a new Character to play, new monsters, items, and other cool mechanics. If we reach this Stretch Goal, all Supporters of this campaign--including those who picked up Just the Game at the $10 Level--will receive the Mind Games Expansion for free.
People who buy the game later will have to pay extra for expansions.

Stretch Goal two is pretty simple: more platforms! If we reach our $90,000 Stretch Goal, we will convert The Pit for Android and iPad, which will make it playable on your data pad of choice!



Kerberos Productions is a small studio of passionate, highly committed game developers in Vancouver, BC. Since the studio formed in 2004 we have released three ground-breaking games for the PC: Sword of the Stars, Fort Zombie, and Sword of the Stars 2: Lords of Winter.
 
For eight years we have worked to build and maintain a reputation for innovative design, developer-player interaction and post-release product support which is second to none. We are a small company with big ideas and a big heart.
 

 
The production team of Sword of the Stars: The Pit consists of seven professional game devs, who between them have over 80 years of experience in the computer gaming industry. We've contributed to 15 released titles over the years.
 
For more information about the dev team, please visit our Team Page.
 


We Have a Plan to Become Fully Independent
The Plan has both Short term and Long Term Goals.
The Short Term Goal is simple. We wanted to make The Pit. It is a fun little game, and we hope that you will enjoy it.
The Long Term Goal is more complicated. We need to find a new way of making games in general. Our player base has been actively trying to support our studio for years, by buying our games and expansions.
Sadly, in the eight years that we have been making games, not a penny of that support has EVER reached us directly. The old system just isn't working well for us, for a variety of reasons, and we aren't alone in this: there are a lot of developers feeling the crunch.
Needless to say, in order to keep doing what we love to do and still survive, we have to start doing things in new ways.
We Want More Control
It is time to move forward on our own.
We want more control over the complete life cycle of our games, from funding and early development to release. We want to be able to keep up product support long after our games hit the market.
In order to achieve this, we need your help.
We Want to Connect
We have always been one of the most accessible game dev teams in the business. Now, thanks to sites like Indiegogo and Kickstarter, our connection to our players can have a lot more impact on the health of our studio and the direction of our games.
A committed group of supporters can make amazing things happen. The Pit is living proof of that.
You can decide what games are made, and how much content those games will have.
The Pit Is Part of the Plan
Our plan is to start small and work our way to bigger things.
 
We want to develop a catalog of games which are completely independent and self-published. We're starting with small projects, games with smaller budgets and faster turn-around times.
 
Over time we'll build up to bigger, more ambitious games. Small projects like The Pit will teach us what we need to know about publishing and distributing our own games and merchandise.
 
Once we have a few successful self-published games under our belts, we'll be ready to launch something bigger and more involved, like Fort Zombie 2 or Northstar.
 

Join the Expedition
Every supporter of this campaign will be listed in the credits for The Pit if they wish, and will have access to some special wallpapers, forum avatars and regular updates on the progress of the game.
If you can't chip in right now, you can still help!
Get the word out and help make some noise about The Pit! We have a nice selection of banners that you can put into your signature file on your forum of choice, and we’re happy to answer questions about the game or our future on your site of choice for gaming news and reviews.
Get the word out about the Big Switch to fully independent development for Kerberos. Spread the word about any games that you liked from us in the past, and the games you'd like to see from us in the future.
Share this campaign with your friends, family, and followers!

<p>This here is the first <i>""big""</i> and conventional game by the newly started <i>Colonthree Enterprises</i> based in Oslo, Norway. We're formed by a small group of people who like games and one of us has even had a few years working in the industry on some major titles like <i>The Sims</i> and <i>FIFA</i>. <b>Catmouth Island</b> is an idea that has been in the works since early 2012, but due to other obligations, full-time work hasn't been possible until May 2013. We have released one game already for Android called <i>Chairspin</i>.</p>
<p>We really enjoy making games, and couldn't think of anything else we'd rather do (except for being an astronaut, but that's a given). We want to make an enjoyable 3D exploration game for more than just handheld devices, so if you have seen the video by now, <b>PC</b> and <b>Mac</b> are our next big targets, but we're going to need your help to get there. :3</p>

<p><i>Catmouth Island</i> is <b>an island 3D exploration game</b> in which you will get an <b>episodic progression</b> of events. The <i>main focus is on exploring</i> the island group, <i>clearing puzzles</i> and interacting with its inhabitants to learn about its secretive past.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The control setup is simple:</b> You <i>point</i> and <i>click</i> where you want the character to go, and the same goes for all kinds of interactions. You see the game from a top-down perspective, but depending on the zoom-level you can move quicker around the island by using the map or slower if you are zooming in close to look for a specific object or just want to read a sign or something.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/92944/files/20130924074704-presentashon3.png?1380034024"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Each episode will have its own set of puzzles and relevant NPCs, as well as other minor details. You are free to replay a previous episode at any time should you want to. If you get stuck, some NPCs will give hints to what you can do to progress, but don't worry, once you get into it you will <i>(hopefully)</i> enjoy it. :3</p>

<p></p>
<p>Each important place on the island will have its own themed music, so that you can just listen and recognise where you are without having to watch the game. We believe music is a big part of any game, so it is important that it sounds as well as it looks.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>There will be over 60 NPCs</b> to talk to, and lots of objects to interact with, meaning there are plenty of things to do, and hopefully this will make your play time a last a little longer should you choose to interact with everything.</p>

<p>You can probably tell already, but for the art style we have drawn some inspiration from <i>Wind Waker</i>, although lower poly. We want this game to look bright and cartoony, where anything can, and will, happen. :3</p>
<p>We are using <b>Unity 3D</b> for this as it is the most flexible engine for a multi-platform release, and we have had good experience working with it on our previous game <i>Chairspin</i>. :3</p>

<p><br/></p>Some people have been asking <b>what kind of puzzles</b> this game will have. As every puzzle will be part of the process to finish an episode, they will be needed to be completed in certain orders, meaning that you unlock new puzzles as you complete old ones. Some parts, like in older adventure games, will have a bit more of a non-linear approach where you can decide which puzzle to solve first as part of a bigger puzzle. Any puzzle can be a part of a larger puzzle.<p></p>
<p><b>Some puzzles are dependent on the time of day.</b> The day and night cycle pass at a decent pace so don't worry if you should miss an opportunity. You will also have a watch that you can use to speed up the pace to get to the point of day you need to be at in order to get access to a certain puzzle.</p>
<p>These are some of the kinds of puzzles present in this game:</p>

<b>1. The simple fetch quest.</b><p></p>
<p>A character on the island asks you to find, bring, or deliver an item. This can be seen as a tedious task, but just talk to any NPC and you will get hints and clues where to find the items. Nag enough and some might even tell you very specific places to look. Some items require you to talk someone into letting you have it, or by giving you access to otherwise closed areas. There are plenty of other ways you can get an item too, but telling it all would be boring and spoil the fun of exploration. :3</p>

<p><b>2. Item combination.</b></p>
<p>Some items require you to combine them with other items to form a new item that can be used to solve a puzzle. Let's say you have a bicycle chain and a saw. Combining them will give you a (rather useless, but) cool makeshift chainsaw that you can use to impress a character or cut down some ropes. The functionality of an item will be determined and explained by the puzzle requiring it, so there will be no need to go through your entire inventory to combine every item to see if you can make them match.</p>

<b>:3. Environment interaction.</b><p></p>
<p>Things around you can be interacted with. Some for fun and some as part of a puzzle. These can be as simple as a lever that needs to be pulled, or as complex as an ancient artefact that you have to do some research into by talking to characters and using your brain to understand how to work out. Some environment objects can require an item to function, and others can require a character to be present in order to work.</p>

<p><i>Catface islands</i> are an island group in the middle of the <i>Pacific Ocean</i>. Not much is known about the outside world, but that will be up to you to find out. The biggest island is <b>Catmouth Island</b>, where most of the game will take place, but two smaller islands called <b>Squeak Point</b> and <b>Guinea Peak</b> are also a big part of the island group. There are rumours of a secret island located behind these two islands, but maybe it is just an old folk tale.</p>
<p></p>

<p><b>This is an old version of the island, but the shape is still the same!</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>There are several businesses operating on and around the islands, and they enjoy a comparable current-day technological situation, with cellphones, the internet and of course broadband. They also have taken agricultural advances to a new level, with meat plants replacing livestock to provide the inhabitants with a good and healthy source of protein. Meat plants can grow either above ground or under water, depending on its type. The taste will also be affected, meaning there is something for everyone. Otherwise fish and other sea creatures (and the occasional seagull) provides other sources of meat. :3~</p>
<p>However, there are difficulties getting off the island to see what the rest of the world is like. A long time ago all communication with the rest of the world was lost. The reason remains a mystery, and the few efforts to send people by ship to find land have always resulted in the people washing ashore a few weeks later, dead and half ways eaten by sharks. As they have yet to get a working dirigible or any other means of air transport due to the loss of the engineering archives, no further attempts have been undertaken to cross the sea. But every once in a while, a <i>foreign cruise ship</i> does come into port...</p>

<p>We're asking for <i>10 grand</i> because we will need that to make the game translate perfectly across the different platforms we are aiming for. We already have received a bit of funding from <b>Innovasjon Norge</b> to get the first episode out the door, but in order to optimise it and make it scalable we are going to need the extra money.</p>
<p><b>Most of the money will go towards development</b> (code, QA, art, sound), but some of it will also be used on software licences to help make it easier to develop. This will in time make future episode releases a lot easier and seamless.</p>
<p>One of the challenges of the game is a technical one, but it is rooted in performance. <i>Draw calls</i> have always been a big issue for 3D games, and for this game we aim to keep them at the absolute minimum, using as few materials as possible, to make sure this game runs at a solid fps no matter the device you are playing on (within reason of course). This has been a complex task to plan out, but for now it is working out wonders. Since it is also just one guy (me!) doing the graphics, things might take a little longer to produce, but there is no excuse for bad performance. We are going to make sure this game runs as good as possible, and should you (upon the release of the first episode) have any performance issues with the game, we'll do whatever we can to solve it or at least help out to make you understand why it is like that. :3<br/></p>
<p><b>In order to make it easy for you to contribute</b>, we are starting the perks at <i>just 5 bux</i> so that in the case you end up not liking the game or are just a tiny bit sceptical, you will not feel like you have been ripped off or wasted any money. Games are too expensive already and I think you will agree with that. :3</p>
<p>Sorry we cannot provide stuff like t-shirts, bags, cups and so on as we are a tiny company and every monetary unit counts directly towards the development of the game.</p>
<p>If we don't make our goal, the funds will all go towards development, but it will take longer to develop as the lead developer (me) will have to take a part-time job in order to cover the rest that is needed. <i>The game is going to be made no matter what!</i> &gt;:3</p>

Some people have been asking what kind of puzzles this game will have. As every puzzle will be part of the process to finish an episode, they will be needed to be completed in certain orders, meaning that you unlock new puzzles as you complete old ones. Some parts, like in older adventure games, will have a bit more of a non-linear approach where you can decide which puzzle to solve first as part of a bigger puzzle. Any puzzle can be a part of a larger puzzle.
Some puzzles are dependent on the time of day. The day and night cycle pass at a decent pace so don't worry if you should miss an opportunity. You will also have a watch that you can use to speed up the pace to get to the point of day you need to be at in order to get access to a certain puzzle.
These are some of the kinds of puzzles present in this game:


1. The simple fetch quest.
A character on the island asks you to find, bring, or deliver an item. This can be seen as a tedious task, but just talk to any NPC and you will get hints and clues where to find the items. Nag enough and some might even tell you very specific places to look. Some items require you to talk someone into letting you have it, or by giving you access to otherwise closed areas. There are plenty of other ways you can get an item too, but telling it all would be boring and spoil the fun of exploration. :3



2. Item combination.
Some items require you to combine them with other items to form a new item that can be used to solve a puzzle. Let's say you have a bicycle chain and a saw. Combining them will give you a (rather useless, but) cool makeshift chainsaw that you can use to impress a character or cut down some ropes. The functionality of an item will be determined and explained by the puzzle requiring it, so there will be no need to go through your entire inventory to combine every item to see if you can make them match.


:3. Environment interaction.
Things around you can be interacted with. Some for fun and some as part of a puzzle.

In order to make it easy for you to contribute, we are starting the perks at just 5 bux so that in the case you end up not liking the game or are just a tiny bit sceptical, you will not feel like you have been ripped off or wasted any money. Games are too expensive already and I think you will agree with that. :3
Sorry we cannot provide stuff like t-shirts, bags, cups and so on as we are a tiny company and every monetary unit counts directly towards the development of the game.
If we don't make our goal, the funds will all go towards development, but it will take longer to develop as the lead developer (me) will have to take a part-time job in order to cover the rest that is needed. The game is going to be made no matter what! >:3







If you believe in this project but for some reason cannot support it with cold, hard cash, then please spread the link, the video, tweet, message, call, shout, scream and let the whole world know of this project!
We also would like feedback on the campaign, its perks, the game, and anything else you would like to talk to us about. Anything is a good thing, even just a message with something as short as ""ur game sux"" or ""the best evar!!11"" counts. :3





If we reach the 10 grand goal early, there will be stretch goals and also nice additions to the perks! More details to come if we get there, but it will be glorious and you will want some once you see what we have planned! :3




We thank all of you verily in advance for considering your participation, and with your economical support we hope to be able to pull off this episode within February 2014. :3",25.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Radical Fish Games is a small group of game developers who believe that the devil is in the detail.</p>
<p>We are a young studio and crazy about details. So we tend to polish our stuff, be it animations, controls, physics or that one pixel in the interface that just didn't seem right. We like our games with a touching story and challenging, fast-paced gameplay. You find those qualities in RPGs, Action-Adventures, Beat'em Ups, and all kind of genres, really. So we think: why not simply mix up those genres and create something new? And since we all grew up in the 16-bit area, we add some good ol' 2D sprite art on top. That's what we do in a nutshell.</p>
<h4>Felix ‘Lachsen’ Klein - Director, Designer, Programmer - @lachsen</h4>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1248221/files/20150225074050-lachsen.png?1424878850"" src="""" style=""float: left;width: 150px;clear: both;""/><div style=""margin-left:158px;"">
<p>A PhD student in computer science with a love for JavaScript. Also a passionate part-time sprite artist and game developer for over 14 years. After a long time he teamed up with the others to realize his vision of a new type of RPG… about throwing balls.</p>
<p>He does all sorts of things for CrossCode: engine development, character design, sprite art, and writing. He also likes food. A lot. In fact, why is this cake still in the picture?</p>
</div>
<p style=""clear: both;""> </p>
<h4>Stefan Lange - Programmer, Game Designer - @radicalregiden</h4> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1248223/files/20150225074117-stef.png?1424878877"" src="""" style=""float: left;width: 150px;""/><div style=""margin-left:158px;"">
<p>A talented programmer with an unparalleled attention for details. Be it a glitching animation or a wrong pixel - he’ll see all of it. Every. Single. One. He introduced the idea of making a game as a team to Felix. Since then they have been working together to bring CrossCode to life.</p>
<p>He’s the person behind the elaborate menu system of CrossCode and much of the RPG features you can find in the game. Occasionally he also does concept arts and character writing.</p>

<h4>Henning ‘GFlügel’ Hartmann - Game Designer</h4> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1248224/files/20150225074124-henne.png?1424878884"" src="""" style=""float: left;width: 150px;clear: both;""/><div style=""margin-left:158px;""><p><span>Henning is our spreadsheet wielder. Since the very beginning he worked with Stefan and Felix as a gameplay advisor. Over time he became a game designer for CrossCode. He is constantly involved in crucial design choices, builds some of the areas and keeps the game balanced.</span></p></div>
<p style=""clear: both;""> </p>
<h4>Fabrice ‘Frece’ Magdanz - Concept Artist</h4> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1248225/files/20150225074131-frece.png?1424878891"" src="""" style=""float: left;width: 150px;clear: both;""/><div style=""margin-left:158px;""><p>Fabrice is a concept designer aspiring to become the ultimate concept designer. He works as a freelancer and became a member of Radical Fish Games after Thomas introduced him as a possible concept artist. Since then he worked on all the area designs and concepts as well as creating various designs for the NPCs and characters of CrossCode.</p></div>
<p style=""clear: both;""> </p>
<h4>Janina 'Solacy' Preidel - Concept Artist</h4> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1248226/files/20150225074136-chise.png?1424878896"" src="""" style=""float: left;width: 150px;clear: both;""/><div style=""margin-left:158px;""><p>Solacy joined the team pretty early and made the very first concept artworks for the game. For instance, the Japanese garden area at the start of the game? That’s her design! Since we have Fabrice doing all the area designs now, Solacy will be working on enemy designs in the future.</p></div>
<p style=""clear: both;""> </p>
<h4>Thomas ‘T-Free’ Fröse - Sprite Artist</h4> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1248227/files/20150225074144-thomas.png?1424878904"" src="""" style=""display: block;float: left;width: 150px;""/><div style=""margin-left:158px;""><p>Thomas is one of the most amazing sprite artists you can find. Not only can he create any kind of sprite by sheer willpower, no, he also animates all of it. His job is to make all the crazy effects for the element modes and animate the enemies. In fact, the huge crab boss in the demo was made by him.</p></div>
<p style=""clear: both;""> </p>
<h4>Martina Brodehl - Sprite Artist</h4> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1248228/files/20150225074151-martina.png?1424878911"" src="""" style=""display: block;float: left;width: 150px;""/><div style=""margin-left:158px;""><p>Martina is one of the first team members of Radical Fish Games and has been working on creating the environment graphics you can see inside the game.

A lot of them. All the small details like plants, shelves or rubbish on the floor are done by him. But wait, there’s more! Sometimes he also creates bigger things like the observatory you can find the exploration part in the demo.</p></div>
<p style=""clear: both;""> </p>
<h4>Deniz ‘Intero’ Akbulut - Music - @interovgm</h4> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1248230/files/20150225074206-tero.png?1424878926"" src="""" style=""display: block;float: left;width: 150px;""/><div style=""margin-left:158px;""><p>A university student at day and a super composer at night. His music is what you can hear in the IndieGogo Trailer and he is also responsible for the whole Soundtrack of CrossCode. He always makes sure his tracks are perfect. No, really! As long as his tracks are not good enough, he has trouble getting sleep! He's also very delicious.</p></div>
<p style=""clear: both;""> </p>
<h4>Flora ‘Teflora’ Valerius - Sound</h4> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1248232/files/20150225074219-flo.png?1424878939"" src="""" style=""display: block;float: left;width: 150px;""/><div style=""margin-left:158px;""><p>A musician who always tries out new and ambitious ideas. Florian spends his quality time walking the earth with his recorder in order to find the perfect sound. As you expected he does a lot of the sounds for CrossCode. Be it the humming of the cargo ship engine, a sound effect for teleportations or a confirmation sound for the menu. He’s got it covered.</p></div>
<p style=""clear: both;""> </p>
<h4>Anthony ‘Airon’ Oetzmann - Sound</h4> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1248233/files/20150225074225-airon.png?1424878945"" src="""" style=""display: block;float: left;width: 150px;""/><div style=""margin-left:158px;""><p>A professional sound designer for over XX years.

<h4>Josephin ‘Chibi’ Rettig - Avatars</h4> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1248854/files/20150225113441-chibi.png?1424892881"" src="""" style=""display: block;float: left;width: 150px;""/><div style=""margin-left:158px;""><p>A talented artist who’s responsible for the avatars of all the team members.

<h3>Why this campaign?</h3>
<p>This campaign helps us making our dream come true. For almost 4 years we've been dreaming of creating CrossCode, our very first game. Developing is our passion and we try to express this through our game. Making a game of this scale costs a lot of money. And we don’t want to work part-time on this game. We want to throw everything we got into this and so our only options are to sell our souls to the devil or invite actual players to help us make the game. We don’t just want to ask for money. We also ask for your support and your opinion on our game. We want to make the process of creating CrossCode as open as possible. Be it via technical posts or live dev streams where you can watch us scream at code! (no pun intended)</p>
<p>So since we want to be open, here is a chart which shows you how the funds are distributed:</p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1248898/files/20150225114734-piechart.gif?1424893654"" src=""""/>
</div>
<div>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why 80,000 €?</h3>
<p><span>First of all,  we chose Euro because we live in Germany and it makes things much much easier for us from a bureaucratic standpoint. For dollar-countries this currently means you actually pay less as the dollar! Dang it, Germany, what is going on? Germany is weird like that, just go with it! Apart from this, 80,000€ is the bare minimum we need in order to keep us alive for the coming months. As long as we can make this game and release it ourselves, everything is okay! </span></p>
<p><span>Following this we plan to participate in programs of the German state, which provide young start-up companies with financial and physical support (such as an office). In addition to that, we will consider patreon or the Humble Widget to have preorders of the game available after the crowdfunding. With this additional income and support, we hopefully will be able to reach our ultimate goal: Making CrossCode!</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Numbers and Reviews!</h3>
</div>
<div>CrossCode has come a long way. What started as a small TechDemo in 2012 evolved into a full feature demo you can play now. And since then, the game found a lot of followers and we managed to get plenty of positive and constructive feedback:</div>
<div>

<h3><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Risks</span></h3>
<p><span>Of course creating a game as independent game developers comes with some risks. Like not having enough money and being unprepared for what lies ahead of us. But we are actually very well prepared and took great care in planning on how we’re going to spend our money and how we’ll manage our schedules. We even planned out the complete workload for the whole game. Felix and Stefan come from a strong IT-background so they both know how to handle a small team. And our weekly meetings help to overcome hurdles much faster as everyone is invited to voice her or his opinion. </span></p> <h3>Help us by telling the world!</h3>
<p>If you like what you’re reading and want this game to become reality, tell your friends, tell your family and tell the world! Help us to make this game, our dream, come to life. We are grateful for every support because without you, we wouldn’t even be here today. </p>
<p>So lets make a game, lets make CrossCode!</p>

 Meet Lea. She is player of CrossWorlds - a fictional online game of the distant future. She has also lost her memory and is mute. Literally mute.Now the only way to regain her memory is to play CrossWorlds.You will follow her adventures and journey through CrossWorlds, discovering all the places the game has to offer. As Lea’s memory returns, a deep mystery surrounding CrossWorlds will be unraveled - and you may come to understand why a mute player is stuck in this game in the first place.Take the best out of two popular genres, find a good balance between them and make a great game. That’s what CrossCode does. And it works pretty well. You get the puzzles of Zelda-esque dungeons and are rewarded with the great variety of equipment you know and love from RPGs. During the fast-paced battles you will use the tools you find on your journey to reveal and exploit the enemies' weaknesses and at the same time will be able to choose equipment and skills for a more in-depth approach in fighting your enemies.Here are all the mechanics that make CrossCode special:Ball Throwing PuzzlesThe essence of CrossCode is throwing balls at everything: boxes, switches, enemies and more.Balls come in two forms: regular shots, which can be thrown quickly, and power shots, which will bounce on walls and are especially useful for puzzles: Action-Combat-System The combat in CrossCode is fast-paced and diverse.At your disposal:

Balls for ranged attacks.

Melee to bash nearby enemies.

Dashing to quickly dodge attacks.

Guarding to block things that are too swift to dodge
And finally, combat arts that can be combined with all previous actions: Character Building Being a proper Action-RPG you get all those features you know and love:

Leveling up your character.

Choosing equipment that will influence your battle stats and actions.

Acquiring new skills for more options during combat.
ElementsOn your journey you will master 4 different elements: Heat, Cold, Shock and Wave. The elements will be used in combat but also to solve certain puzzles.Stay tuned for more updates as we plan to tell you in more details how the elements in CrossCode are used!CrossCode takes places in a game called CrossWorlds, a fictional online game of the distant future. CrossWorlds is a strange game because of two reasons: First, for some reason it’s all about throwing balls and second, it takes place on a real planet in real space:Players of CrossWorlds can remotely connect from far away, walking the planet via physical avatars, experiencing the world with all 5 senses - not even to mention the excellent framerate and resolution!As you will follow Lea on her journey through CrossWorlds you’ll experience a variety of different places ranging from hot deserts over snowy mountains to humid jungles.And that’s all! Or is it?Actually, we plan to reveal more about CrossWorlds as the campaign continues. So stay tuned for more updates and watch this section grow!The soundtrack is composed by the amazing Deniz ‘Intero’ Akbulut. We know him for a long time and it was clear that only he could make the Music for CrossCode. He also was the only one available!Checkout out the tracks on Soundcloud: 


 

Radical Fish Games is a small group of game developers who believe that the devil is in the detail.
We are a young studio and crazy about details. So we tend to polish our stuff, be it animations, controls, physics or that one pixel in the interface that just didn't seem right. We like our games with a touching story and challenging, fast-paced gameplay. You find those qualities in RPGs, Action-Adventures, Beat'em Ups, and all kind of genres, really. So we think: why not simply mix up those genres and create something new? And since we all grew up in the 16-bit area, we add some good ol' 2D sprite art on top. That's what we do in a nutshell.
Felix ‘Lachsen’ Klein - Director, Designer, Programmer - @lachsen

A PhD student in computer science with a love for JavaScript. Also a passionate part-time sprite artist and game developer for over 14 years. After a long time he teamed up with the others to realize his vision of a new type of RPG… about throwing balls.
He does all sorts of things for CrossCode: engine development, character design, sprite art, and writing. He also likes food. A lot. In fact, why is this cake still in the picture?

 
Stefan Lange - Programmer, Game Designer - @radicalregiden 
A talented programmer with an unparalleled attention for details. Be it a glitching animation or a wrong pixel - he’ll see all of it. Every. Single. One. He introduced the idea of making a game as a team to Felix. Since then they have been working together to bring CrossCode to life.
He’s the person behind the elaborate menu system of CrossCode and much of the RPG features you can find in the game. Occasionally he also does concept arts and character writing.

 
Henning ‘GFlügel’ Hartmann - Game Designer Henning is our spreadsheet wielder. Since the very beginning he worked with Stefan and Felix as a gameplay advisor. Over time he became a game designer for CrossCode. He is constantly involved in crucial design choices, builds some of the areas and keeps the game balanced.
 
Fabrice ‘Frece’ Magdanz - Concept Artist Fabrice is a concept designer aspiring to become the ultimate concept designer. He works as a freelancer and became a member of Radical Fish Games after Thomas introduced him as a possible concept artist. Since then he worked on all the area designs and concepts as well as creating various designs for the NPCs and characters of CrossCode.
 
Janina 'Solacy' Preidel - Concept Artist Solacy joined the team pretty early and made the very first concept artworks for the game. For instance, the Japanese garden area at the start of the game? That’s her design! Since we have Fabrice doing all the area designs now, Solacy will be working on enemy designs in the future.
 
Thomas ‘T-Free’ Fröse - Sprite Artist Thomas is one of the most amazing sprite artists you can find. Not only can he create any kind of sprite by sheer willpower, no, he also animates all of it. His job is to make all the crazy effects for the element modes and animate the enemies. In fact, the huge crab boss in the demo was made by him.
 
Martina Brodehl - Sprite Artist Martina is one of the first team members of Radical Fish Games and has been working on creating the environment graphics you can see inside the game. That means all the beautiful scenery you walk through in the game was made by her.
 
Daniel ‘The_question’ Tillmann - Sprite Artist Daniel is actually a musician (Check out Furious Feedback if you want to learn more) but for CrossCode he creates graphics. A lot of them. All the small details like plants, shelves or rubbish on the floor are done by him. But wait, there’s more! Sometimes he also creates bigger things like the observatory you can find the exploration part in the demo.
 
Deniz ‘Intero’ Akbulut - Music - @interovgm A university student at day and a super composer at night. His music is what you can hear in the IndieGogo Trailer and he is also responsible for the whole Soundtrack of CrossCode. He always makes sure his tracks are perfect. No, really! As long as his tracks are not good enough, he has trouble getting sleep! He's also very delicious.
 
Flora ‘Teflora’ Valerius - Sound A musician who always tries out new and ambitious ideas. Florian spends his quality time walking the earth with his recorder in order to find the perfect sound. As you expected he does a lot of the sounds for CrossCode. Be it the humming of the cargo ship engine, a sound effect for teleportations or a confirmation sound for the menu. He’s got it covered.
 
Anthony ‘Airon’ Oetzmann - Sound A professional sound designer for over XX years. He created many battle sound effects for CrossCode, like the things you hear when the ball hits its target or when you cut through hordes of nearby enemies. He will also help us design breathtaking sound effects for all the 4 elements of the games.
 
Josephin ‘Chibi’ Rettig - Avatars A talented artist who’s responsible for the avatars of all the team members. Thanks to her the team can show the world how we look in real life and who knows? Maybe she will also create more graphics for us in the future!

Why this campaign?
This campaign helps us making our dream come true. For almost 4 years we've been dreaming of creating CrossCode, our very first game. Developing is our passion and we try to express this through our game. Making a game of this scale costs a lot of money. And we don’t want to work part-time on this game. We want to throw everything we got into this and so our only options are to sell our souls to the devil or invite actual players to help us make the game. We don’t just want to ask for money. We also ask for your support and your opinion on our game. We want to make the process of creating CrossCode as open as possible. Be it via technical posts or live dev streams where you can watch us scream at code! (no pun intended)
So since we want to be open, here is a chart which shows you how the funds are distributed: 


 
Why 80,000 €?
First of all,  we chose Euro because we live in Germany and it makes things much much easier for us from a bureaucratic standpoint. For dollar-countries this currently means you actually pay less as the dollar! Dang it, Germany, what is going on? Germany is weird like that, just go with it! Apart from this, 80,000€ is the bare minimum we need in order to keep us alive for the coming months. As long as we can make this game and release it ourselves, everything is okay! 
Following this we plan to participate in programs of the German state, which provide young start-up companies with financial and physical support (such as an office). In addition to that, we will consider patreon or the Humble Widget to have preorders of the game available after the crowdfunding. With this additional income and support, we hopefully will be able to reach our ultimate goal: Making CrossCode!
 
Numbers and Reviews!

CrossCode has come a long way. What started as a small TechDemo in 2012 evolved into a full feature demo you can play now. And since then, the game found a lot of followers and we managed to get plenty of positive and constructive feedback:

“I look forward to the full game so I can see more of those great pixels in action.""  -John Polson (indiegames.com) ""I urge everyone to try it out for themselves and see just how promising this game is."" -Menashe (Nintendo enthusiast) ""It has a really nice visual style, an interesting story (...)"" - Vsauce3
We also got greenlit in just 7 days!
Steam Greenlight
We were so amazed by all the support you guys showed us, thank you so much!
 
Risks
Of course creating a game as independent game developers comes with some risks. Like not having enough money and being unprepared for what lies ahead of us. But we are actually very well prepared and took great care in planning on how we’re going to spend our money and how we’ll manage our schedules. We even planned out the complete workload for the whole game. Felix and Stefan come from a strong IT-background so they both know how to handle a small team. And our weekly meetings help to overcome hurdles much faster as everyone is invited to voice her or his opinion.  Help us by telling the world!
If you like what you’re reading and want this game to become reality, tell your friends, tell your family and tell the world! Help us to make this game, our dream, come to life. We are grateful for every support because without you, we wouldn’t even be here today. 
So lets make a game, lets make CrossCode!

We also have winged flight, an AI driven quest engine, and a full planet (possibly solar system) and beyond for you to eventually explore.

You are in one of those stories. Every player server is its own dimension, and when you get one of these villains, he will end up transporting your players to different dimensions until you defeat him. Thus, returning you to your world, and weakening the barrier between you, and the dimensions you are connected to. Now you can develop trade, or go to war with another Dimension. You can even bring back things from those dimensions and reverse engineer them to suit your needs.</span><br/><br/><span style=""font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"">Do not like the multiverse and having to deal with too many players? You can even make a server that is private, or play solo. Even better, love doing Machinimas? Use our single player mode to bring in models to the high res world of DNA, create your town and script your NPCs. Alternatively, use single player as a proving ground for new ideas, including new races that you made.

The game is meant to be a 2 hour to infinite play game. However, not one you have to have a table dedicated for. Towns, events, dungeons, and other things slot into the game board allowing you to ""save"" the game. Your character sheet has slots for equipment so it can be put back in the box without losing anything.

<p>Honestly, physical activity can be boring. And that is
not what kids expect. No, it has to be fun!</p>
<p>Every day active kids are given gold stars as a
reward of their physical activity. The amount of collected gold stars
determines their daily Miiya profile. </p>
<p>Kids, be active and see Miiya turning into a super
hero! And at his stage, get new missions to complete! It's a never-ending
adventure.</p>

activity reports on their smartphone. It takes less than 10 seconds to know if a child has reached the daily objective.</span><br/></p>
<p>How could you not turn into a supporter and be proud of all
he accomplished every day? Your smile is obviously the best reward!</p>

<p>Daily physical
activity means leaving kids playing and running. One potentially unimaginable fear for the
parents is that children might be lost if they go out of sight. That’s why, we
need a system that can warn a parent if a child go too far away and that can
indicate its location.</p>
</div>
<div>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1077862/files/20141207091157-dynamic_safety.png?1417972317"" src="""" style=""width: 165.626712328767px; height: 343px;""/> 
To help you, we create Dynamic Safety. </p>
<p>Just determine a safety zone on the smartphone app, you will be warned if your child goes too far away. Don't worry if you forget to change the limits. Dynamic Safety is able to adapt to changing conditions in any environment. </p>
<p>Let's take an example: Parents who lose visual contact with
their children in a supermarket would like to be warned very soon in that case. But don't worry: we are working hard to make Miiya exceptionally efficient in this field.</p>
</div>
<div>With Miiya, it will be so easy to go to the park with your children and let them play freely, you
will be warned as soon as they will be too far away from you. Now you can
relax and be ready for bigger adventures.</div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1075363/files/20141206014732-miiya_line_2.png?1417859252"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Because sharing great moments with our children is something so important to us, what if we are not there on some momentous occasions? Miiya gives any child the opportunity to tag some moments in the daytime.
So they can still share with you what was really meaningful to them.</p>
<p>They simply have to ""click"" on a button, and Miiya records their position. Then during the sync between Miiya and your smartphone, the information is sent to you. And if you need a new family activity next week-end it is easy then: just have a look at Miiya's timeline. </p>

<p>We
designed Miiya like a daily companion, like a friend for your children. As them, Miiya should be enthusiastic, fun, intrepid... and extremely resistant.</p>

<p>The most difficult stress-test for electronic devices is to spend a whole day with children. That's why we selected robust components and materials, and tested them in a lot a situations.</p>
<p>We know that mud, gravel, sand and dirt are amazing opportunities, and beach is one of the most exiting playground. Therefore Miiya is waterproof and dust resistant, and even more, it is childproof.</p>

<p>Our journey began one year ago. We called the project 'Miiya'. It means 'Hello, how are you?' in Acjachemen - a Californian dialect. This guided us in the design of our smart watch. One year of work, that is the necessary time to turn our idea into a real device that can really help kids. </p>
<p>We actually spent quite a long time with lots of parents together with their children. This was most useful for us to know how to conceive our product. This user-lab experience was thrilling. People were great, and again we wish to thank them sincerely for their ongoing support, patience and care. Now we can help to care of children.</p>

<h3>The Team</h3>
<p>Frederic and Nicolas Bruneau - two brothers with complementary skills - created Miiya.</p>
<p></p>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1077295/files/20141207020547-jde-thx.jpg?1417946747"" src="""" style=""width: 350.890306122449px; height: 263px;""/></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Frederic, Co-founder, Business Development</b></p>
<p> Being a dad is my most significant experience. After a first entrepreneurial experience in energy brokerage area, I decided to create technologies in order to make my children's life much easier. Then I founded Miiya with my brother Nicolas.</p>
<p><i>""When I see the World through my children's eyes, I realize how much we can over-complicate things. If it does not work for them, then it is not a good idea. Reset it all, it must be more simple.""</i><br/></p>
<p><b>Nicolas, Co-founder, Interaction &amp; Engineering </b></p>
<p>Nicolas was Global Head of Quantitative Analysis at Market Solutions - Société Générale Private Banking. As an IT enthusiast, he is convinced that technology can be useful to reach our goals, especially when they deal with health &amp; care. So it is not surprising if he is now designing new services dedicated to children.</p>
<p><i>""When your creativity fails, just imagine what you would like to pass to the next generation; then create and deliver.""</i><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Experienced
and talented people have consolidated the team:</p>
<p><b>Olivier Amberny, Hardware
Development</b></p>
<p>15 years experience in hardware design, (7 years
hardware manager at Technicolor)</p>
<p><b>Yves Voglaire, Services
&amp; industrial design</b></p>
<p>20 years experience in design, a pioneer of service design in Belgium</p>
<p><b>Nicolas Cloarec &amp; Heidi Ghernati Interaction &amp; User Interface design</b></p>
<p>Previously worked with Nissan, Orange, Bang &amp; Olufsen... </p>
<p><b>Julien Buisson, Supply
Chain and Purchasing Management </b></p>
<p>12 years experience (5 years
as a supply chain and purchasing manager for Archos and 2 years as a commodity
manager for Parrot)</p>

We take great care for the quality of our product. We spend a lot of time to choose all components and materials to give children the best product. Solutions (communication, BLE, MEMS) were chosen
to bring added-value features with optimal power consumption and low transmit power.</div><div><br/></div><div>Next step is the certification of the products. Our team has a lot of experience in electronics devices development and has early integrated all type of regulatory expectations.</div><div><br/></div><div><b>Software:</b></div><div>The software and app are functional but we still have much to do with building up all the features we want to include in Miiya app. It's a strategic part. As we definitely want you and your kids to enjoy Miiya experience, features integration is a key development. Therefore we completed our team with a number of embedded software specialists who deal with any emerging problems. <br/>
</div><div><br/></div><div>They've got a lot of experience in B2C product development, and integrate industrial expectations. They are now working on two critical aspects: power consumption optimization and third-party integration.</div><div><br/></div><div>We still work on Miiya Energy Model (based on the Metabolic Equivalent of Task) to improve it and provide the best possible user experience. We want to test it with every kids' moves (even if they are dancing like turtles). If you want to join us, feel free to contact us! </div><div><b>Manufacturing:</b></div><div>
We need to create the tooling to manufacture different parts of the product. This process is complex and requires time, money and experience. We known we can count on our industrial partners' cooperation. They have a great experience in electronics devices manufacturing and they manage all the steps of the industrial process. <br/>

<h3>FAQ's</h3>
</div>
<div>
<b>What phones and devices will work with Miiya?</b><br/><br/>Miiya uses Bluetooth Low Energy to synchronize with your phone. Miiya works with iOS (iPhone 4S to 6Plus). It will be soon compatible with Android (release expected in May 2015) and other platforms (Windows Phone &amp; Blackberry). <p><br/><b>Does Miiya use GPS? Can I know the location of my children at anytime with Miiya?</b><br/><br/>Yes, Miiya contains a GPS module but Miiya is not a tracking device. </p>
<p>If we consider the case where your child is not in the right place, you will be worried but not able to contact him through Miiya. This is not a good experience, that's not Miiya experience!<br/><br/><b>What is the range of the proximity sensor?</b></p>
<p>Without interferences, the Bluetooth signal range is about 200ft (60m). Interferences can be generated by a lot of objects, which reduce the signal range. But anyway, you would not like to be warned too late in a place like an overcrowded shopping mall, would you?</p>
<p><br/><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Are there any countries in which Miiya will not operate?</b><br/><br/>Miiya will work in any place where children are.</p>
<p><br/><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Am I supposed to manually add shipping?</b><br/><br/>Yes, do not forget to add shipping on top of your selected perk before checkout! <br/><br/><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Can I pick a color when I order?</b></p>
<p>Because you support us, we are glad to announce that you will receive four colors when you order. <br/><br/><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Can I ask another question?</b></p>

<p>L’activité physique est parfois ennuyeuse. Ce n’est pas ce que
veulent les enfants. Non, ils ne veulent qu’une chose : du fun !</p>
<p>Chaque jour, les enfants reçoivent des bons points en récompense
de leur activité physique. Le nombre de bons points reçus sur la journée
déterminera leur profil Miiya qui apparaîtra sur leur montre.</p>
<p>Bonne nouvelle ! Les héros Miiya reçoivent de nouvelles
missions ! C’est une aventure sans fin !</p>

<p>Derrière chacun de nos succès, il y a quelqu’un qui a cru en
nous.</p>
<p>Grâce à l’application Miiya, les parents ont accès chaque jour
sur leur smartphone aux rapports d’activité physique de leur enfant. En moins
de 10 secondes, vous savez si votre enfant a atteint son objectif de la
journée.</p>
<p>Comment ne pas devenir son plus grand supporter et ne pas être
fier de tout ce qu’il a accompli aujourd’hui ? Vous voir sourire est leur
plus belle récompense !</p>

<p>Encourager les enfants à pratiquer une activité physique
régulière signifie les faire jouer et courir un peu partout. Pour les parents,
c’est également la crainte que leurs enfants soient perdus s’ils les perdent de
vue. C’est pourquoi nous avons créé un système qui prévient le parent dès lors
que son enfant s’éloigne un peu trop et qui puisse lui indiquer sa
localisation.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1077862/files/20141207091157-dynamic_safety.png?1417972317"" src="""" style=""width: 147.683397683398px; height: 306px;""/> <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Pour vous aider, notre module de ‘Sécurité
dynamique’.</span></p>
<p>Tout ce que vous avez à faire est de déterminer une zone de
sécurité sur l’application smartphone et vous serez prévenus si votre enfant
s’éloigne un peu trop. </p>
<p>Par exemple, des parents qui perdent le contact visuel avec leur
enfant dans un centre commercial voudraient être avertis aussitôt. C’est
pourquoi nous travaillons dur pour que Miiya soit extrêmement efficace dans ce
domaine !</p>

<p></p>
<p>Partager des moments avec nos enfants est extrêmement important
pour un parent. Malheureusement, nous ne passons pas toute la journée à leurs
côtés. Miiya donne la possibilité aux enfants de tagger certains moments de
leur journée. De cette façon, ils peuvent toujours partager avec vous ce qui
est vraiment important pour eux.</p>
<p>En cliquant simplement sur un bouton, Miiya va enregistrer la
position de l’enfant. Lors de la synchronisation entre Miiya et votre
smartphone, l’information vous est envoyée. Vous recherchez une nouvelle
activité à faire en famille pour le week-end prochain ? Jetez un œil au
fil d’actualités de Miiya !</p>

<p>Notre projet a commencé il y a un an. Nous l’avons baptisé
‘Miiya’. Ce qui veut dire ‘Bonjour, comment allez-vous ?’ en Acjachemen,
un dialecte californien. C’est ce que nous dit un ami quand nous le rencontrons
et c’est cela qui nous a guidé pendant toute la conception de notre montre
connectée. Un an, ce fut le temps nécessaire pour passer du stade de l’idée à
celui d’un objet réél, conçu pour aider nos enfants à bien grandir. </p>
<p>Nous avons passé beaucoup de temps avec des parents et leurs
enfants. Nous ne pouvions pas imaginer concevoir Miiya sans nous confronter
sans cesse à la réalité. Cela nous a été extrêmement utile. Prendre part à ce
user-lab était une expérience formidable. L’accueil des participants a été
exceptionnel et nous tenons – une nouvelle fois – à les remercier pour leur
support sans faille ainsi que pour leur patience.</p>

<p>Miiya est la création de deux frères aux compétences
complémentaires, Frédéric et Nicolas Bruneau.</p>
<p><b>Frederic, Co-fondateur, Business Development</b></p>
<p>Devenir papa est ma plus belle entreprise.
Après une première expérience entrepreneuriale dans le monde de l'énergie, j'ai
décidé de créer des technologies qui pouvaient simplifier la vie de mes
enfants. J'ai donc fondé Miiya avec mon frère, Nicolas.<br/>

<h3><b>Risques &amp; Challenges</b></h3>
<p><b>Hardware :</b></p>
<p>Les prototypes hardware
sont fonctionnels. Nous finalisons l’intégration des composants électroniques
dans le boitier de la montre. Nous choisissons les composants avec la plus
grande attention pour fournir aux enfants le meilleur produit possible. Les
solutions que nous avons choisies (Bluetooth Low Energy, centrales à inertie…)
nous permettent à la fois de créer des services à grande valeur ajoutée tout en
optimisant la consommation des composants et en réduisant au minimum les
émissions d’ondes. </p>
<p>Notre prochaine étape est
de faire certifier notre produit. Notre équipe a une très grande expérience en
développement de produit électronique, ce qui nous a permis d’intégrer dès le
départ les contraintes réglementaires.</p>
<p><b>Software :</b></p>
<p>Le software de la montre
et l’application smartphone sont fonctionnels mais nous avons encore du travail
pour inclure certaines fonctionnalités dans l’application Miiya. Il est
primordial pour nous de vous faire profiter de la meilleure expérience
possible. C’est pourquoi nous avons renforcé l’équipe avec des spécialistes en
développement de logiciel embarqué.</p>
<p>Leur expérience en
développement produit B2C est déjà conséquente. Ils travaillent actuellement
sur deux aspects importants : l’optimisation de la consommation et
l’intégration de services tierces.</p>
<p>Nous continuons également
de travailler sur le Miiya Energy Model, le modèle qui nous permet de suivre
l’activité physique des enfants. Au stade actuel, nous sommes des plus satisfaits
par ses résultats. Nous avons cependant de nombreuses idées d’amélioration afin
de rendre l’expérience Miiya toujours plus unique.</p>
<p><b>Fabrication :</b></p>
<p>Nous devons créer
l’outillage industriel nécessaire à la fabrication des différentes parties du
produit. Le processus est complexe et nécessite du temps, du financement et de
l’expérience. Nous savons que nous pouvons compter sur l’expérience et la
coopération de nos partenaires industriels qui maîtrisent l’ensemble des étapes
du processus industriel. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1073483/files/20141205065411-miiya_line_2.png?1417791251"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<h3><b>Foire aux questions</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>Quels téléphones seront
compatibles avec Miiya ?</b> <br/>
Miiya utilise le Bluetooth Low Energy pour se synchroniser avec votre
téléphone. Miiya fonctionne avec iOS (de l’iPhone 4S au 6Plus) et sera bientôt
compatible avec Android (livraison prévue : mai 2015) et d’autres
plate-formes (Windows Phone &amp; Blackberry). </p>
<p><br/>
<b>Est-ce que Miiya utilise un GPS ? Puis-je connaître la localitsation de
mon enfant à n’importe quel moment grâce à Miiya ?</b><br/>
<br/>
Oui, Miiya utilise un module GPS mais n’est pas un dispositif de pistage.</p>
<p>Considérez le cas suivant : votre enfant n’est pas à
l’endroit où il devrait être. Vous commencez à vous inquiéter mais nous ne vous
donnons pas la possibilité de le contacter via Miiya. C’est pourquoi nous
n’avons pas voulu activer cette fonctionnalité</p>
<p><br/>
<b>Quel est la portée du capteur de proximité ?</b></p>
<p>Sans interférences, la portée du signal Bluetooth est d’environ
60 mètres. Nombreux sont les objets qui génèrent des interférences sur le
signal Bluetooth, ce qui réduit la portée du signal. Mais ce n’est pas une
mauvaise chose : vous n’auriez pas envie d’être prévenu dès lors que votre
enfant s’éloigne de plus de 60 mètres de vous dans un environnement bondé comme
un centre commercial, n’est ce pas ?</p>
<p> <b>Y a-t-il des pays où
Miiya ne fonctionne pas ?</b><br/>
<br/>
Non. Miiya fonctionne dans tous les lieux où pourraient se trouver votre
enfant. </p>
<p><b>Dois-je rajouter
manuellement les frais de port pour Miiya ?</b></p>
<p>Oui. Vous pouvez les rajouter juste avant de procéder au
paiement.<br/>
</p>
<p><b><span>Puis-je choisir une couleur pour Miiya quand je passe
commande ?</span></b></p>
<p>Miiya existe en quatre couleurs différentes. Pour vous remercier
de votre support, nous avons le plaisir de vous annoncer que vous recevrez
quatre bracelets de différentes couleurs.</p>
<p><br/>
<b>Suis-je obligé de payer en dollars ?</b></p>
<p>Beaucoup d’entre vous nous ont posé la
question. Pour la campagne de financement participatif, nous nous sommes
associés à Indiegogo, leader mondial, pour leur professionnalisme et leur excellente
réputation. Notre choix a été motivé également parce que nous savons qu’en
passant par Indiegogo, nous sommes sur une plate-forme extrêmement sécurisée
pour l’ensemble des transactions financières. </p>
<p>Malheureusement, sur Indiegogo, un
projet ne peut afficher qu’une seule devise. Pourquoi ne pas avoir pris
l’EURO ? Parce que dans cette devise, Indiegogo ne vous laissez pas la
possibilité de payer par carte bancaire mais uniquement via un compte Paypal.
En posant la question autour de nous, nous nous sommes rendus compte que peu de
nos connaissances avaient un compte Paypal.</p>
<p>C’est pourquoi, au final, nous avons
choisi de proposer nos produits en DOLLARS. Nos contributeurs peuvent ainsi
payer soit par Paypal, soit par carte de crédit. </p>
<p>Pour information : en achetant un
Super Early Bird à 75 USD, vous achetez Miiya entre 60 et 65 EUR (avec le taux
de change actuel – attention la valeur en EUR dépend également des frais de
conversion proposés par votre établissement bancaire) et bénéficiez d’une
remise proche de -40% par rapport au prix public futur (100 EUR). </p>
<p><b>Et si j’ai d’autres questions ?</b></p>
<p>N’hésitez pas à nous
faire part de vos questions / suggestions dans l’onglet COMMENTAIRES en haut de
la page. Nous vous répondrons aussi vite que possible. Vous pouvez aussi nous
laisser un message sur notre <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/miiyaworld"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a> ou

Miiya is designed to help them grow
up healthily.
Miiya turns physical activity into a fun
game, in which your child is a hero.
At the end
of the day, parents know if they reach the 60 minutes of physical activity, as
recommended by the World Health Organization.
Miiya was created to bring families closer.
Discover new games so parents and
child can play together.

Features


Honestly, physical activity can be boring. And that is
not what kids expect. No, it has to be fun!
Every day active kids are given gold stars as a
reward of their physical activity. The amount of collected gold stars
determines their daily Miiya profile. 
Kids, be active and see Miiya turning into a super
hero! And at his stage, get new missions to complete! It's a never-ending
adventure.




Daily rewards and achievements are built to reward your children.
Thanks to Miiya App, parents have a direct access to daily
activity reports on their smartphone. It takes less than 10 seconds to know if a child has reached the daily objective.
How could you not turn into a supporter and be proud of all
he accomplished every day? Your smile is obviously the best reward!






Daily physical
activity means leaving kids playing and running. One potentially unimaginable fear for the
parents is that children might be lost if they go out of sight. That’s why, we
need a system that can warn a parent if a child go too far away and that can
indicate its location.



 
To help you, we create Dynamic Safety. 
Just determine a safety zone on the smartphone app, you will be warned if your child goes too far away. Don't worry if you forget to change the limits. Dynamic Safety is able to adapt to changing conditions in any environment. 
Let's take an example: Parents who lose visual contact with
their children in a supermarket would like to be warned very soon in that case. But don't worry: we are working hard to make Miiya exceptionally efficient in this field.

With Miiya, it will be so easy to go to the park with your children and let them play freely, you
will be warned as soon as they will be too far away from you. Now you can
relax and be ready for bigger adventures.




Because sharing great moments with our children is something so important to us, what if we are not there on some momentous occasions? Miiya gives any child the opportunity to tag some moments in the daytime.
So they can still share with you what was really meaningful to them.
They simply have to ""click"" on a button, and Miiya records their position. Then during the sync between Miiya and your smartphone, the information is sent to you. And if you need a new family activity next week-end it is easy then: just have a look at Miiya's timeline. 



We
designed Miiya like a daily companion, like a friend for your children. As them, Miiya should be enthusiastic, fun, intrepid... and extremely resistant.



The most difficult stress-test for electronic devices is to spend a whole day with children. That's why we selected robust components and materials, and tested them in a lot a situations.
We know that mud, gravel, sand and dirt are amazing opportunities, and beach is one of the most exiting playground. Therefore Miiya is waterproof and dust resistant, and even more, it is childproof.





A day with Miiya


How does Miiya work? 





Where we are & why we need you

Our journey began one year ago. We called the project 'Miiya'. It means 'Hello, how are you?' in Acjachemen - a Californian dialect. This guided us in the design of our smart watch. One year of work, that is the necessary time to turn our idea into a real device that can really help kids. 
We actually spent quite a long time with lots of parents together with their children. This was most useful for us to know how to conceive our product. This user-lab experience was thrilling. People were great, and again we wish to thank them sincerely for their ongoing support, patience and care. Now we can help to care of children.



Where we are
We have explored and tested a lot of possibilities.



Now, we have a functional prototype. To turn it into series product, we have worked with industrial partners. We've got a complete vision of the industrial process, and start to solve emerging problems.




Why we need you
Our next step is to turn Miiya into a hero. That's why we've turned to Indiegogo. We expect to deliver the best experience to parents and children. With your support, we will get this product to market. 
All together, we can turn Miiya into a hero! 








Perks


















The Team
Frederic and Nicolas Bruneau - two brothers with complementary skills - created Miiya.



Frederic, Co-founder, Business Development
 Being a dad is my most significant experience. After a first entrepreneurial experience in energy brokerage area, I decided to create technologies in order to make my children's life much easier. Then I founded Miiya with my brother Nicolas.
""When I see the World through my children's eyes, I realize how much we can over-complicate things. If it does not work for them, then it is not a good idea. Reset it all, it must be more simple.""
Nicolas, Co-founder, Interaction & Engineering 
Nicolas was Global Head of Quantitative Analysis at Market Solutions - Société Générale Private Banking. As an IT enthusiast, he is convinced that technology can be useful to reach our goals, especially when they deal with health & care. So it is not surprising if he is now designing new services dedicated to children.
""When your creativity fails, just imagine what you would like to pass to the next generation; then create and deliver.""

Riks & Challenges
Hardware:Hardware prototypes are functional. We are now finishing the integration of all electronics parts in the mechanical casing. We take great care for the quality of our product. We spend a lot of time to choose all components and materials to give children the best product. Solutions (communication, BLE, MEMS) were chosen
to bring added-value features with optimal power consumption and low transmit power.Next step is the certification of the products. Our team has a lot of experience in electronics devices development and has early integrated all type of regulatory expectations.Software:The software and app are functional but we still have much to do with building up all the features we want to include in Miiya app. It's a strategic part. As we definitely want you and your kids to enjoy Miiya experience, features integration is a key development. Therefore we completed our team with a number of embedded software specialists who deal with any emerging problems. 
They've got a lot of experience in B2C product development, and integrate industrial expectations. They are now working on two critical aspects: power consumption optimization and third-party integration.We still work on Miiya Energy Model (based on the Metabolic Equivalent of Task) to improve it and provide the best possible user experience. We want to test it with every kids' moves (even if they are dancing like turtles). If you want to join us, feel free to contact us! Manufacturing:
We need to create the tooling to manufacture different parts of the product. This process is complex and requires time, money and experience. We known we can count on our industrial partners' cooperation. They have a great experience in electronics devices manufacturing and they manage all the steps of the industrial process.  



FAQ's


What phones and devices will work with Miiya?Miiya uses Bluetooth Low Energy to synchronize with your phone. Miiya works with iOS (iPhone 4S to 6Plus). It will be soon compatible with Android (release expected in May 2015) and other platforms (Windows Phone & Blackberry). Does Miiya use GPS? Can I know the location of my children at anytime with Miiya?Yes, Miiya contains a GPS module but Miiya is not a tracking device. 
If we consider the case where your child is not in the right place, you will be worried but not able to contact him through Miiya. This is not a good experience, that's not Miiya experience!What is the range of the proximity sensor?
Without interferences, the Bluetooth signal range is about 200ft (60m). Interferences can be generated by a lot of objects, which reduce the signal range. But anyway, you would not like to be warned too late in a place like an overcrowded shopping mall, would you?
Are there any countries in which Miiya will not operate?Miiya will work in any place where children are.
Am I supposed to manually add shipping?Yes, do not forget to add shipping on top of your selected perk before checkout! Can I pick a color when I order?
Because you support us, we are glad to announce that you will receive four colors when you order. Can I ask another question?
Yes! Feel free to leave a comment on the COMMENT tab at the top of the page. We reply as soon as possible! You can also leave a message on our Facebook or Twitter pages, or just send us an email contact@mymiiya.com

Fonctionnalités



L’activité physique est parfois ennuyeuse. Ce n’est pas ce que
veulent les enfants. Non, ils ne veulent qu’une chose : du fun !
Chaque jour, les enfants reçoivent des bons points en récompense
de leur activité physique. Le nombre de bons points reçus sur la journée
déterminera leur profil Miiya qui apparaîtra sur leur montre.
Bonne nouvelle ! Les héros Miiya reçoivent de nouvelles
missions ! C’est une aventure sans fin !




Derrière chacun de nos succès, il y a quelqu’un qui a cru en
nous.
Grâce à l’application Miiya, les parents ont accès chaque jour
sur leur smartphone aux rapports d’activité physique de leur enfant. En moins
de 10 secondes, vous savez si votre enfant a atteint son objectif de la
journée.
Comment ne pas devenir son plus grand supporter et ne pas être
fier de tout ce qu’il a accompli aujourd’hui ? Vous voir sourire est leur
plus belle récompense !





Encourager les enfants à pratiquer une activité physique
régulière signifie les faire jouer et courir un peu partout. Pour les parents,
c’est également la crainte que leurs enfants soient perdus s’ils les perdent de
vue. C’est pourquoi nous avons créé un système qui prévient le parent dès lors
que son enfant s’éloigne un peu trop et qui puisse lui indiquer sa
localisation. Pour vous aider, notre module de ‘Sécurité
dynamique’.
Tout ce que vous avez à faire est de déterminer une zone de
sécurité sur l’application smartphone et vous serez prévenus si votre enfant
s’éloigne un peu trop. 
Par exemple, des parents qui perdent le contact visuel avec leur
enfant dans un centre commercial voudraient être avertis aussitôt. C’est
pourquoi nous travaillons dur pour que Miiya soit extrêmement efficace dans ce
domaine !




Partager des moments avec nos enfants est extrêmement important
pour un parent. Malheureusement, nous ne passons pas toute la journée à leurs
côtés. Miiya donne la possibilité aux enfants de tagger certains moments de
leur journée. De cette façon, ils peuvent toujours partager avec vous ce qui
est vraiment important pour eux.
En cliquant simplement sur un bouton, Miiya va enregistrer la
position de l’enfant. Lors de la synchronisation entre Miiya et votre
smartphone, l’information vous est envoyée. Vous recherchez une nouvelle
activité à faire en famille pour le week-end prochain ? Jetez un œil au
fil d’actualités de Miiya !




Nous avons conçu Miiya comme un ami pour votre enfant. C’est pourquoi nous avons fait de Miiya un personnage enthousiaste, fun, intrépide et surtout extrêmement résistant.


Pour un objet électronique, passer toute la journée avec un
enfant peut se révéler très éprouvant. C’est pourquoi nous avons choisi des
composants et des matériaux robustes, testés dans de nombreuses situations.

Nous savons que la boue, le sable et la plage font partie des
meilleurs terrains de jeu au monde. C’est pourquoi, Miiya est étanche, résiste
à la poussière et encore plus important, conçu pour résister aux assauts de nos
enfants !


Une journée avec Miiya

Comment Miiya fonctionne ?





Où en sommes nous ? Pourquoi avons-nous besoin de
vous ?

Notre projet a commencé il y a un an. Nous l’avons baptisé
‘Miiya’. Ce qui veut dire ‘Bonjour, comment allez-vous ?’ en Acjachemen,
un dialecte californien. C’est ce que nous dit un ami quand nous le rencontrons
et c’est cela qui nous a guidé pendant toute la conception de notre montre
connectée. Un an, ce fut le temps nécessaire pour passer du stade de l’idée à
celui d’un objet réél, conçu pour aider nos enfants à bien grandir. 
Nous avons passé beaucoup de temps avec des parents et leurs
enfants. Nous ne pouvions pas imaginer concevoir Miiya sans nous confronter
sans cesse à la réalité. Cela nous a été extrêmement utile. Prendre part à ce
user-lab était une expérience formidable. L’accueil des participants a été
exceptionnel et nous tenons – une nouvelle fois – à les remercier pour leur
support sans faille ainsi que pour leur patience.



Où en sommes-nous ?
Nous avons exploré et testé de nombreuses possibilités.



A l’heure actuelle, nous avons un prototype fonctionnel. Pour
lancer la production en série de Miiya, nous avons travaillé avec des
partenaires industriels. Nous avons une vision tout à fait complète du processus
industriel et avons déjà commencé à résoudre les problèmes associés.



Pourquoi avons-nous besoin de votre soutien ?
Pour nous, la prochaine étape est de faire de Miiya un héros qui
prend soin des enfants. C’est pourquoi nous nous sommes lancés sur Indiegogo.
Nous voulons présenter notre projet au plus grand nombre de parents afin de
leur fournir la meilleure expérience possible. Avec votre support, nous
pourrons mettre Miiya sur le marché !
Tous ensemble, nous pouvons faire de Miiya un héros !

nous permettent à la fois de créer des services à grande valeur ajoutée tout en
optimisant la consommation des composants et en réduisant au minimum les
émissions d’ondes. 
Notre prochaine étape est
de faire certifier notre produit. Notre équipe a une très grande expérience en
développement de produit électronique, ce qui nous a permis d’intégrer dès le
départ les contraintes réglementaires.
Software :
Le software de la montre
et l’application smartphone sont fonctionnels mais nous avons encore du travail
pour inclure certaines fonctionnalités dans l’application Miiya. Il est
primordial pour nous de vous faire profiter de la meilleure expérience
possible. C’est pourquoi nous avons renforcé l’équipe avec des spécialistes en
développement de logiciel embarqué.
Leur expérience en
développement produit B2C est déjà conséquente. Ils travaillent actuellement
sur deux aspects importants : l’optimisation de la consommation et
l’intégration de services tierces.
Nous continuons également
de travailler sur le Miiya Energy Model, le modèle qui nous permet de suivre
l’activité physique des enfants. Au stade actuel, nous sommes des plus satisfaits
par ses résultats. Nous avons cependant de nombreuses idées d’amélioration afin
de rendre l’expérience Miiya toujours plus unique.
Fabrication :
Nous devons créer
l’outillage industriel nécessaire à la fabrication des différentes parties du
produit. Le processus est complexe et nécessite du temps, du financement et de
l’expérience. Nous savons que nous pouvons compter sur l’expérience et la
coopération de nos partenaires industriels qui maîtrisent l’ensemble des étapes
du processus industriel. 

Foire aux questions

Quels téléphones seront
compatibles avec Miiya ? 
Miiya utilise le Bluetooth Low Energy pour se synchroniser avec votre
téléphone. Miiya fonctionne avec iOS (de l’iPhone 4S au 6Plus) et sera bientôt
compatible avec Android (livraison prévue : mai 2015) et d’autres
plate-formes (Windows Phone & Blackberry). 

Est-ce que Miiya utilise un GPS ? Puis-je connaître la localitsation de
mon enfant à n’importe quel moment grâce à Miiya ?

Oui, Miiya utilise un module GPS mais n’est pas un dispositif de pistage.
Considérez le cas suivant : votre enfant n’est pas à
l’endroit où il devrait être. Vous commencez à vous inquiéter mais nous ne vous
donnons pas la possibilité de le contacter via Miiya. C’est pourquoi nous
n’avons pas voulu activer cette fonctionnalité

Quel est la portée du capteur de proximité ?
Sans interférences, la portée du signal Bluetooth est d’environ
60 mètres. Nombreux sont les objets qui génèrent des interférences sur le
signal Bluetooth, ce qui réduit la portée du signal. Mais ce n’est pas une
mauvaise chose : vous n’auriez pas envie d’être prévenu dès lors que votre
enfant s’éloigne de plus de 60 mètres de vous dans un environnement bondé comme
un centre commercial, n’est ce pas ?
 Y a-t-il des pays où
Miiya ne fonctionne pas ?

Non. Miiya fonctionne dans tous les lieux où pourraient se trouver votre
enfant. 
Dois-je rajouter
manuellement les frais de port pour Miiya ?
Oui. Vous pouvez les rajouter juste avant de procéder au
paiement.

Puis-je choisir une couleur pour Miiya quand je passe
commande ?
Miiya existe en quatre couleurs différentes. Pour vous remercier
de votre support, nous avons le plaisir de vous annoncer que vous recevrez
quatre bracelets de différentes couleurs.

Suis-je obligé de payer en dollars ?
Beaucoup d’entre vous nous ont posé la
question. Pour la campagne de financement participatif, nous nous sommes
associés à Indiegogo, leader mondial, pour leur professionnalisme et leur excellente
réputation. Notre choix a été motivé également parce que nous savons qu’en
passant par Indiegogo, nous sommes sur une plate-forme extrêmement sécurisée
pour l’ensemble des transactions financières. 
Malheureusement, sur Indiegogo, un
projet ne peut afficher qu’une seule devise. Pourquoi ne pas avoir pris
l’EURO ? Parce que dans cette devise, Indiegogo ne vous laissez pas la
possibilité de payer par carte bancaire mais uniquement via un compte Paypal.
En posant la question autour de nous, nous nous sommes rendus compte que peu de
nos connaissances avaient un compte Paypal.
C’est pourquoi, au final, nous avons
choisi de proposer nos produits en DOLLARS. Nos contributeurs peuvent ainsi
payer soit par Paypal, soit par carte de crédit. 
Pour information : en achetant un
Super Early Bird à 75 USD, vous achetez Miiya entre 60 et 65 EUR (avec le taux
de change actuel – attention la valeur en EUR dépend également des frais de
conversion proposés par votre établissement bancaire) et bénéficiez d’une
remise proche de -40% par rapport au prix public futur (100 EUR). 
Et si j’ai d’autres questions ?
N’hésitez pas à nous
faire part de vos questions / suggestions dans l’onglet COMMENTAIRES en haut de
la page. Nous vous répondrons aussi vite que possible. Vous pouvez aussi nous
laisser un message sur notre Facebook ou
notre Twitter. Ou si vous

<p>The

of the  largest battleship ever built in the history of naval
warfare, IJN Yamato, giving you the opportunity to change the history of her tragic end.

You can become a commander, an artilleryman, or a private navy man. You can visit inside of the ship, take control of every artillery post – from the primary guns to the anti-aircraft flaks - supervise the ship's ballasting in response to the incoming damage, or even tweak the dynamic system of armored plates and bulkheads.<br/><p>

<p>Ever since I can remember, I was interested in warships and naval warfare. At the age of 12, I read the book ""Storm over the Pacific"" by Zbigniew Flisowski, which is commonly acknowledged as a sort of bible for Pacific naval battles. For years, I’ve been enthralled by the atmosphere of sea combat, making board games and building models (like ""The Battleship Yamato (Anatomy of the Ship)"" by Janusz Skulski, or ""Battleship Musashi"" by Akira Yoshimura).</p>Back then, there was no Internet and scarcely any video games. But today, modern technologies allow to reenact the battles in full 3D.  That’s how the story of the <b>Naval Engine</b> has started.<br/><p><br/></p>

<p>Naval Engine is a custom physics engine that supports all the game mechanics. It is a wide collection of tools and libraries, gathered and optimized throughout the years of work. Naval Engine utilizes multiple CPU cores to simulate physics of the ships and their smooth movement over a realistically depicted ocean, as well as damage to their hull and eventual destruction.</p>This sophisticated engine enabled us to create a game that works smoothly even low-end system. Its beginnings date to back to 2004, though the project evolved over the years, and gradually transformed into a plan to make a game out of a passion and love for warships.<p><br/></p>

Turns out people have become much too complex to send to either just heaven or hell when they die, so it was revealed that you will take a certain “death route” depending on how you lived and died.The Miracle Festival celebrates this special day and the beauty of the cycle of life and death. It happens all over the planet but the festival in Mordimane, the planet's densest city, is said to be the grandest of them all.This year, the festival started out great as usual but halfway through the day the air became very...Charged. No one could touch anything without getting a small shock and peoples hair was standing on end. Most don’t care much and are still enjoying the festival as normal, but a select few take off to see if they can find the cause of this phenomenon.​Hello! My name is Sawney and I am making a shoot em game series inspired by the fast-paced and beautiful to look at gameplay of ""Touhou Project""and other bullet hells.I've always wanted to make a game where my characters could come to life, and although I am still new to the programming scene I want to make the best bullet hell I can possibly make. The first game in the series, ""Nociception ~ Simple outlook from hell"" is already almost done and should hopefully be out by the end of 2020 or early 2021, and its sequel is already in development as well. In order to keep up this pace however, I need your help. The recent pandemic has left me relocated away from home and my job. I do not make the game alone, I commission talented musicians to make the soundtrack and get much help from other programmers as well. I do not want their hard work to go a penny underpaid, so understand that when you donate, you are not only donating to support me but also directly donating to these wonderful peoples commission funds!The musicians I'm working with include:-Princess Sylvysprit-PengoSolventThe series is not about one character in particular but many! From an immortal child and their ghost friend exploring dangerous places just out of curiosity, to a demon wanting to go to the surface world so she can get an ice cream, to reaching the edge of the universe. There are many planned adventures in this series I would love to share with you! I truly thank you if you help me reach my goal today and help me find a stable place in life while doing what I love. The first game, Nociception ~ Simple Outlook from Hell will feature:-3 story mode stages, with 4 levels of difficulty from easy to desperate. -A bonus, extra hard stage with a secret boss!-Beautiful Touhou style music-One playable character, Empitts the demon who has a powerful spread shot-And, the first game will be 100% FREE!!! The game will cost nothing!!The second game, Nociception ~ Voltaic Marketplace will feature --FIVE playable characters with different unique powers! And one extra....-6 story mode stages, some with changing bosses depending what character you choose-An extra hard bonus stage!-All new graphics, bigger resolution, a new style of music, new characters!-Donators characters can appear!-Much more! There are many more games planned after these first two, I cannot wait to share them with you! Contact me @nocicepti0n on twitter for more info!Always looking for new playtesters!Play a small demo of the first game here! https://www.bulletforge.org/u/sawney/p/nocicept...",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><img alt=""Campaign goals"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/dPHO2UB.png"" src="""" style=""font-size: 10px;"" title=""Campaign goals""/></h3>
<p>The game is currently in pre alpha state. It means it's good for doing the new pre alpha teaser video but most features are only 50 to 70% done, not polished enough to be put in the hands of gamers.</p>
<p>This is due to the fact the team members have been working on it at night after their day jobs, since one year. And we are going crazy doing that.</p>
<p>So we want serious funding to make this game a reality. If we don't get enough funding we will release it anyway, but it will take really long!</p>
<p>The more we get, the more features we can include, and the more peole can work full time on the game - more Programmers / QA testers / Graphics and sound Designer. And we would be pleased to hire some of the best builders from the community!</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">Cubes and Zombies is a Fantasy Zombie Survival RPG game where you must protect a crystal in middle of the map and survive zombies attacks. As in any RPG, you keep leveling up, assigning stat points for strength, agility, intellect and develop your character by perks/traits/talents. Day and night have different tasks: during the day, the player tries to collect enough food to survive and some resources to prepare for the night when he must fight with the zombies. The player can build ramparts, watch towers, and so forth, to protect both the crystal and himself. Because I love cubes and randomness, you can expect randomly generated items and, most important, a changing world. I am not talking about a procedurally generated world like many games on the market but about something very, very different and, I believe, absolutely unique.</p>

This element have huge impact to game play. For example, when grassland is on most of cubes, the player has lots of food and resources to prepare for night. On the other hand, when most of the terrain is desert, food is very rare and the player must discover different ways to prepare and survive.</p>

<h3>I believe this game deserves your attention.</h3></div>","Game is now on Steam Greenlight. Give me a THUMBS UP to help my game get on Steam!

Let me introduce myself:
My name is Matej Soják. I am 23 years old and I love video games. Games have been in my life from my early days. Back then, each game was unique and every game developer tried to create something new, to invent new game mechanisms, but today I just see FPS and games without any innovating ideas. So I want to introduce to you my game - Cubes and Zombies.
 
About the game:
Cubes and Zombies is a Fantasy Zombie Survival RPG game where you must protect a crystal in middle of the map and survive zombies attacks. As in any RPG, you keep leveling up, assigning stat points for strength, agility, intellect and develop your character by perks/traits/talents. Day and night have different tasks: during the day, the player tries to collect enough food to survive and some resources to prepare for the night when he must fight with the zombies.

Because I love cubes and randomness, you can expect randomly generated items and, most important, a changing world. I am not talking about a procedurally generated world like many games on the market but about something very, very different and, I believe, absolutely unique.

The World is constantly changing:
In the game we have one large central cube with crystal that the player tries to protect. Around this big cube are small cubes that are randomly generated. Each side of the cube has a randomly generated terrain with randomly generated trees, flowers, rocks, and so forth, on them. These cubes are ROTATING over time. This element have huge impact to game play. For example, when grassland is on most of cubes, the player has lots of food and resources to prepare for night. On the other hand, when most of the terrain is desert, food is very rare and the player must discover different ways to prepare and survive.

I dont know when but I will add multiplayer to this game. After release you can expect free content patches.
 
Why do I need money?
I will love to work on this project as a full time job so that I can have the time to improve the game even further.
I believe this game deserves your attention.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hello! We are John Koenig and Gabriel Brockman (gabrielbishop) and together we form what the IRS lovingly calls Called Shot LLC. John is currently a PhD student at the University of Minnesota studying parallel and distributed real time simulation and Gabriel is a freelance artist specializing in concept and 3D art.</p>
<p>Over the past two years The Electric Adventures of Watt (TEAoW) and the creation of its underlying engine, Ymir, have been the focus of much of our free time. Both of these projects are very large in scope and, in order devote more time to these endeavors, we will need financial support. That is why we have come here to ask for your help in staving off the distractions of outside work so we can give both of these projects our full attention.</p>
<p>This is a community based project and we will show our thanks by keeping the fruit of our labors available to all. The contributions to the community that will be realized by the funding of this project will be threefold:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>The Game: </strong>An action-packed, head-to-head platformer will be unleashed upon the world. The playable demo will be short but fully capable and will enable you to destroy your friends (or enemies) in new, fun, and creative ways. Furthermore, a fully functional demo will allow us to seek out additional funding we will need in order to evolve TEAoW into a full single/multi-player experience.</li>
<li>
<strong>The Engine: </strong>The distributed, parallel game engine powering TEAoW, Ymir, will forever be open source and licensed under GNU GPL. We want to see Ymir enabling others to power their worlds over many cores and across multiple machines.</li>
<li>
<strong>The Game Assets: </strong>Game assets used to create TEAoW will be licensed under Creative Commons and disseminated to the community through popular channels (i.e. opengameart.org).</li>
</ol>

<h3><strong style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Ymir</strong></h3>
<p><strong>(This section is for those interested in the technical aspects of Ymir)</strong></p>
<p>Ymir has been designed since its inception as a cross-platform, open-source, and openly licensed game engine capable of making full use of modern gaming platforms. The future of gaming platform performance is no longer dependent on regular increases in processing speed a single processor (core) but rather the inclusion of additional processors (cores). In order for any game engine to make full use of modern CPUs it must emply simulation methods capable of using multiple processors.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong style=""font-size: 1.17em;""> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Aren’t other game engines already doing this?</strong></h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Traditionally, games developers employ the so-called <em>game loop </em>to drive their game. Everything is handled within this game loop: User input is gathered and managed, game objects are moved, collisions are resolved, and the entire scene is redrawn to connected displays. This sequence is done over-and-over again until some event causes the entire process to stop.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">While this method has served the game development community well, the traditional game loop can only be performed by a single processor. In other words without some sort of intervention the traditional game loop does not make full use of modern multi-core processors (scale).</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">To our knowledge, there are no other modern game engines available to independent developers that effectively scale over multiple cores. Sure, many make use multiple cores when loading a scene or when sending or receiving data over a network, but this only makes marginal use of the additional processing horsepower provided by multiple cores. As a result the entire game simulation can only proceed as fast as a single processor can execute each step of the game loop.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">There are many challenges to making a game engine capable of making use of multiple cores, however, a foundation exists within state-of-the-art research for those bold enough to take on this challenge.</p>
<h3><strong> </strong></h3>
<h3>
<strong>What </strong><strong>technologies</strong><strong> does Ymir use to accomplish this?</strong> </h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Ymir currently makes use of several technologies to realize its mission on Linux, Mac, and Windows. In order to simplify the task of computing over many cores and across many machines a majority of underlying game engine is written in Erlang. Erlang interacts with various other components written in other languages to draw scenes, gather user input, play sounds, and perform the other tasks that Erlang is ill-suited for. Currently, online rendering is provided by <a href=""http://www.ogre3d.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ogre3D</a> and offline rendering is provided by <a href=""http://www.mitsuba-renderer.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mitsuba</a>.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">We are excited by both modes of rendering as we will soon be able to support both modes simultaneously. Imagine being able to capture in-game footage which can be later rendered into the amazing quality that only offline rendering can achieve!</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Stay tuned to our <a href=""http://www.calledshot.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">development blog</a> as John will be documenting Ymir more completely in the coming weeks.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>Disclaimer: </strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Many of you who are familiar with game development are likely uneasy about the use of non-canon languages being used for a game engine. We are firm believers in not reinventing the wheel and using the best tool for the job. Higher-level language constructs and a robust, battle-tested runtime currently makes Erlang the best tool for distributed computation on a single platform as well as across heterogeneous platforms. It is not our intention for developers using Ymir to know Erlang. It is on our road map to provide front-ends to Ymir which will enable Ymir users to develop their games in more conventional languages (e.g. Lua, C, Python). </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>That's nice, can it be done?</strong></h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Yes, and we have some very promising early results! Below is a graph which demonstrates how well Ymir scales while rendering the dynamic scene contained in our video section: </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><img alt=""Speed up vs no. of cores"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/923366/pictures/full/20130711070617-dynamic_speedup.png?1373551579"" src="""" style="""" title=""ymir chat 1""/></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Not bad, eh?  Game simulations are not easily scaled so we are very pleased with the performance gains we are seeing.   Below you will see our frame rates rendering the same dynamic scene: </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><img alt=""Frame rate vs step size"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/923363/pictures/full/20130711070503-dynamic_framerate.png?1373551514"" src="""" style="""" title=""Ymir chart 2""/></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">We are not stopping here though!  We will continue to tweak our existing approach and experiment with new approaches in order to bring both the blue and red lines as close to ideal as possible!</p>
<h3>Music</h3>
<p>We all know how essential music is to the gaming experience. That's why we are thrilled to welcome the newest member of the TEAoW team, Peter Wallin. A gifted musician and writer Peter brings some much needed skills to the team. Already hard at work Peter has gifted us with the song that accompanies our pitch video. This is only the beginning.  Peter has concepts for at least 6 additional tracks and spends much of his free time banging out more on his guitar.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for updates from Peter in the days to come.</p>

<h2><strong>Indiegogo</strong></h2>
<h3>Why fund Ymir and TEAoW?</h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>In exchange for funding you get:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin-left: 30px;"">An action packed game</li>
<li style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Openly licensed game-ready assets</li>
<li style=""margin-left: 30px;"">A game engine with access to source code</li>
<li style=""margin-left: 30px;"">PERKS!</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">With all you can get for your pledge of support; from a digital high-five to full inclusion in project planning as well as a some wicked cool ONE-OF-A-KIND artwork, game assets and source code, we feel confident in a fair exchange.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Your funding for our passion and hard work ultimatlely resuliting in a hugely shareable gaming experiance.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">We need funding for:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Creating our art assets</li>
<li style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Feature development for Ymir</li>
<li style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Polisihing and testing</li>
<li style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Recording music and sound FX</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">In order to devote ourselves full-time we need funding. We feel that full-time focus is the BEST course of action at this time.</p>
<h3>Why 14k?</h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Being a small team we have to be realistic. Most game titles these days require years of work and big teams to shoulder the workload. So how are three guys gonna get it done with only 14k and about nine months? Well, full time work for starters. Also, we have intentionally designed the playable demo to be less asset intensive than, say, a full story-mode title. Finally, we must consider that part of the battle is already behind us, the concept is complete and Ymir is already being tested. </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">The majority of the 14k will go to the development and integration of 3D game assets as well as commission new works from our musician.  We assert that - given 9 months of full time labor and 14k to cover production costs and living expences - we feel confident that we produce a playable demo which will not only bring enjoyment to you, but also allow us to push forward and seek additional sources of funding. </p>
<h3>Why flexible funding? (What if we don't make 14k?)</h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">There has been some flack floating about regarding flexible funding and we think that the fears and concerns are largely a product of ignorance. We chose flexible funding because we know what we have; the right project and the ability to deliver. Should we fail to reach our goal rest assured that the Watt will go on. Here are three possible futures:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">We meet our goal and all is well. We would expect to release the playable demo in second quarter of 2014!</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Plan B: We will use the funds we do raise as leverage to generate additional investments to make up the difference. </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Plan C: In the worst case scenario we would need to cut our hours, relying more heavily on third-party assets to fill in some gaps. We prefer to see TEAoW done sooner rather than later and will avoid release delays at all costs. </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Whatever comes to pass, we will be frequent in our communications. Whether via project updates here or on our blog, you will know exactly what is going on and how much longer you have to wait.</p>
<h3>Stretch?</h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">What's that you say?  What if we EXCEED our goal?  Now we are talking!  We want to stay focused and gorunded in reality though, so we haven't spent too much time thinking about this scenario. By exceeding our goal we will have proven what we already know in our hearts to be true; that Ymir and The Electric Adventures of Watt is bigger than any one of us.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Should TEAoW funding breache 14k we will certainly address this with more thought, in the mean time here are some strech goals we have in mind.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>16k</strong> - More, better music. Music is essential to the gaming experience and we do not wish to skimp!  More money means we can actually pay our current musician the wage that he deserves, for work he has already done and commision additional peices. </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>24k</strong> - See those Illuminarians and Creep all greyed out above?  We want to make those playable characters in the demo!  We just need to keep Gabe fed and happy so he can get them modelled and animated. </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>250k</strong> - We make the whole game!</p>

A Dark Planet
On a lonely, dark planet in deep space the story of TEAoW unfolds. This solitary rock hurtles through open space, ominously orbiting a black hole which has long fed from this remote region of space.
 
The only light which shines upon the planet's harsh, jagged surface originates from distant stars. Very little organic life exists here. What atmosphere the planet had has long been lost and the only organic life known to exist are strange vining plants, so-called power plants, which feast off what faint radiation happens to fall upon the planet. Quickly these plants grow, branching their vines outward and upward in attempt to gather as much radiation possible. As vines mature, they produce small buds in which they store excess energy.
Although distinctly short on organic life, the planet is home to two warring factions: mechanical citizens of Illuminaria and the mysterious Creep.
 
Illuminaria

 
The city of Watt and his people, Illuminaria is a bastion of light and innovation. Illuminaria's citizens, all constructed according to the designs of The Engineer, play out their peaceful lives in the life giving light emanating from The Core which hangs high overhead. No one knows exactly who The Engineer was or why he (or she) built Illuminaria, however, it is by the protocols set forth by The Engineer that Illuminaria has prospered.
Every citizen has a specialized role to play. While most citizens never leave their city, a select few are purposed with venturing out into the darkness to harvest the rippened power plant buds and deliver them back to The Core where they are ultimately used as fuel. These harvesters are outfitted with incandescent bulbs in order to ward off hostile Creep. These light sources must be used optimally, however, as harvesters have a limited amount of mechanical energy to power and too much direct light renders harvested power plant bulbs inert.
 

 
Creep
Denizens of the darkness and seemingly conjured out of the shadows of your own fearful imaginings, the Creep inhabit the parts of our lonely planet that are most devoid of light.  All too often they can be found in and amongst mature power plants. These shadowy creatures hate the light and will do all in their power to extinguish any source of it. 

 
Creeps appear to be entirely ephemeral and take on a multitude of sinister shapes, despite this, they have some ability to manifest, either to throw or push objects. Their origin is unkown.  Where did they come from? Why are they here? Are you brave enough to venture out into the blackness to discover their secrets?

To our knowledge, there are no other modern game engines available to independent developers that effectively scale over multiple cores. Sure, many make use multiple cores when loading a scene or when sending or receiving data over a network, but this only makes marginal use of the additional processing horsepower provided by multiple cores. As a result the entire game simulation can only proceed as fast as a single processor can execute each step of the game loop.
There are many challenges to making a game engine capable of making use of multiple cores, however, a foundation exists within state-of-the-art research for those bold enough to take on this challenge.
 

What technologies does Ymir use to accomplish this? 
Ymir currently makes use of several technologies to realize its mission on Linux, Mac, and Windows. In order to simplify the task of computing over many cores and across many machines a majority of underlying game engine is written in Erlang. Erlang interacts with various other components written in other languages to draw scenes, gather user input, play sounds, and perform the other tasks that Erlang is ill-suited for. Currently, online rendering is provided by Ogre3D and offline rendering is provided by Mitsuba.
We are excited by both modes of rendering as we will soon be able to support both modes simultaneously. Imagine being able to capture in-game footage which can be later rendered into the amazing quality that only offline rendering can achieve!
Stay tuned to our development blog as John will be documenting Ymir more completely in the coming weeks.
Disclaimer: 
Many of you who are familiar with game development are likely uneasy about the use of non-canon languages being used for a game engine. We are firm believers in not reinventing the wheel and using the best tool for the job. Higher-level language constructs and a robust, battle-tested runtime currently makes Erlang the best tool for distributed computation on a single platform as well as across heterogeneous platforms. It is not our intention for developers using Ymir to know Erlang. It is on our road map to provide front-ends to Ymir which will enable Ymir users to develop their games in more conventional languages (e.g. Lua, C, Python). 
 
That's nice, can it be done?
Yes, and we have some very promising early results! Below is a graph which demonstrates how well Ymir scales while rendering the dynamic scene contained in our video section: 

Not bad, eh?  Game simulations are not easily scaled so we are very pleased with the performance gains we are seeing.   Below you will see our frame rates rendering the same dynamic scene: 

 
We are not stopping here though!  We will continue to tweak our existing approach and experiment with new approaches in order to bring both the blue and red lines as close to ideal as possible!
Music
We all know how essential music is to the gaming experience. That's why we are thrilled to welcome the newest member of the TEAoW team, Peter Wallin. A gifted musician and writer Peter brings some much needed skills to the team. Already hard at work Peter has gifted us with the song that accompanies our pitch video. This is only the beginning.  Peter has concepts for at least 6 additional tracks and spends much of his free time banging out more on his guitar.
Stay tuned for updates from Peter in the days to come.

Why fund Ymir and TEAoW?
In exchange for funding you get:

An action packed game
Openly licensed game-ready assets
A game engine with access to source code
PERKS!

With all you can get for your pledge of support; from a digital high-five to full inclusion in project planning as well as a some wicked cool ONE-OF-A-KIND artwork, game assets and source code, we feel confident in a fair exchange.
Your funding for our passion and hard work ultimatlely resuliting in a hugely shareable gaming experiance.
We need funding for:

Creating our art assets
Feature development for Ymir
Polisihing and testing
Recording music and sound FX

In order to devote ourselves full-time we need funding. We feel that full-time focus is the BEST course of action at this time.
Why 14k?
Being a small team we have to be realistic. Most game titles these days require years of work and big teams to shoulder the workload. So how are three guys gonna get it done with only 14k and about nine months? Well, full time work for starters. Also, we have intentionally designed the playable demo to be less asset intensive than, say, a full story-mode title. Finally, we must consider that part of the battle is already behind us, the concept is complete and Ymir is already being tested. 
The majority of the 14k will go to the development and integration of 3D game assets as well as commission new works from our musician.  We assert that - given 9 months of full time labor and 14k to cover production costs and living expences - we feel confident that we produce a playable demo which will not only bring enjoyment to you, but also allow us to push forward and seek additional sources of funding. 
Why flexible funding? (What if we don't make 14k?)
There has been some flack floating about regarding flexible funding and we think that the fears and concerns are largely a product of ignorance. We chose flexible funding because we know what we have; the right project and the ability to deliver. Should we fail to reach our goal rest assured that the Watt will go on. Here are three possible futures:
We meet our goal and all is well. We would expect to release the playable demo in second quarter of 2014!
Plan B: We will use the funds we do raise as leverage to generate additional investments to make up the difference. 
Plan C: In the worst case scenario we would need to cut our hours, relying more heavily on third-party assets to fill in some gaps. We prefer to see TEAoW done sooner rather than later and will avoid release delays at all costs. 
Whatever comes to pass, we will be frequent in our communications. Whether via project updates here or on our blog, you will know exactly what is going on and how much longer you have to wait.
Stretch?
What's that you say?  What if we EXCEED our goal?  Now we are talking!  We want to stay focused and gorunded in reality though, so we haven't spent too much time thinking about this scenario. By exceeding our goal we will have proven what we already know in our hearts to be true; that Ymir and The Electric Adventures of Watt is bigger than any one of us.
Should TEAoW funding breache 14k we will certainly address this with more thought, in the mean time here are some strech goals we have in mind.
16k - More, better music. Music is essential to the gaming experience and we do not wish to skimp!  More money means we can actually pay our current musician the wage that he deserves, for work he has already done and commision additional peices. 
24k - See those Illuminarians and Creep all greyed out above?  We want to make those playable characters in the demo!  We just need to keep Gabe fed and happy so he can get them modelled and animated. 
250k - We make the whole game!



 
I love Watt but I don't have the scratch!

<h3>#################################</h3>
<h3>What is the XStylus?</h3>
<div>The XStylus was designed from my own desire to have a comfortable stylus which can be stored in the original pen slot of the Nintendo handheld game console. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>After a year of drafting, designing, tweaking and prototyping, the XStylus became my solution of transforming the tiny touch pen that comes with the Nintendo game console into a pen that is as wide as a regular pencil.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The XStylus Crayon is compatible with the Nintendo 3DS, DSLite, DSi and DSi XL.</div>
<div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px;""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Tahoma,sans-serif; font-size: large;""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px;""><br/></span></span></span></span></div>

<div>
<h3>Who is the XStylus for?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gamers who are looking for a wide-grip, more comfortable touch pen that can be store inside the original pen slot of the handheld</li>
<li>Serious Nintendo gamers (3DS, DSLite, DSi, DSi XL) who are accuracy and performance driven</li>
<li>Individuals who are supportive of low tech and simple design solutions.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Why the XStylus?</h3>
</div>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin: 0px; font: 12px 'Times New Roman';""> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Play longer </p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The wide grip minimizes strain in the muscles of your hand and forearm</p>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
<p>Achieve more</p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p>With your fingers wider apart, you have more degree of movement in your wrist. Thus more accuracy and dexterity as you tap and draw on your touch screen.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
<p>Color your gaming experience</p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A pack of XStylus Crayon comes in 4 color combinations that are only available to funders of this IndieGoGo project.  We will be using black, blue, red and white to make the color combos. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
<p>Be cool and original! </p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p>By supporting this project, you will be part of a group of people in the world who are helping to materialize this design into an actual product. We are only producing a limited quantity of this pen at this initial stage so you'll be the first people in the world to own one in your community or city!</p>

<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Funders of this project will get the ""IndieGoGo Special Edition"", which comes in a set of 4 pens in various color combinations of black, white, red and blue.  This special edition will not be available elsewhere. Also, we have put together a pretty attractive perk scheme and by supporting this project on any of the perk level, you will get something in return once the project completes in May.   Check it out on the right---&gt;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here's an illustration of the possible color combos... Nothing has been confirmed yet so what you'll receive will be a total surprise!</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Our project goal is US$7,000 but our real goal is really US$10,000... I know it is a lot of money to make this tiny pen but this is the bare minimum amount for me to start the production of this project and to get the XStylus into your hands.  This cost includes the cost of the production moulds, ""304 stainless steel"" screws, sourcing and trial of the raw materials, the cost of the silicon mould for the initial prototypes, shipping charges etc...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a cost of fundraising on IndieGoGo, I'm expecting to pay US$700-1000 in commission, exchange rate fees and transaction fees to IndieGoGo and Paypal.  So, I'd really end up with just around US$6,000-9,000 for everything else, depending on how much I raise in 60 days.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By lowering my goal, I'm trying to minimize my risk (IndieGoGo takes 9% instead of 4% if my goal is not reached before the deadline).  <strong>Looking at the bright side, once US$7000 is reached, I will start production so that the XStylus Crayons can reach you sooner.</strong></p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>How can we get people interested in this project?  Please help us spread the word to people you know who are performance driven in their gaming experience.  Please facebook us, tweet about us and share your support with your circle of Nintendo friends!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""margin: 0.83em 0px; font: bolder 1.17em Helvetica,Arial,Tahoma,sans-serif;"">Calling for Reviewers:</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We are currently looking for established game reviewers who'd be interested in using this pen in their video reviews.  If you would like to test run this pen in your upcoming game review, please send me an <a href=""mailto:info@greenbulb.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">e-mail</a> with a link to your website or blog.

After a year of drafting, designing, tweaking and prototyping, the XStylus became my solution of transforming the tiny touch pen that comes with the Nintendo game console into a pen that is as wide as a regular pencil.
 
The XStylus Crayon is compatible with the Nintendo 3DS, DSLite, DSi and DSi XL.




Who is the XStylus for?

Gamers who are looking for a wide-grip, more comfortable touch pen that can be store inside the original pen slot of the handheld
Serious Nintendo gamers (3DS, DSLite, DSi, DSi XL) who are accuracy and performance driven
Individuals who are supportive of low tech and simple design solutions.

 

 
Why the XStylus?

 
 


Play longer 



The wide grip minimizes strain in the muscles of your hand and forearm



Achieve more



With your fingers wider apart, you have more degree of movement in your wrist. Thus more accuracy and dexterity as you tap and draw on your touch screen.



Color your gaming experience



A pack of XStylus Crayon comes in 4 color combinations that are only available to funders of this IndieGoGo project.  We will be using black, blue, red and white to make the color combos. 



Be cool and original! 



By supporting this project, you will be part of a group of people in the world who are helping to materialize this design into an actual product. We are only producing a limited quantity of this pen at this initial stage so you'll be the first people in the world to own one in your community or city!



 
 
 


What You Get
Funders of this project will get the ""IndieGoGo Special Edition"", which comes in a set of 4 pens in various color combinations of black, white, red and blue.  This special edition will not be available elsewhere. Also, we have put together a pretty attractive perk scheme and by supporting this project on any of the perk level, you will get something in return once the project completes in May.   Check it out on the right--->
 
Here's an illustration of the possible color combos... Nothing has been confirmed yet so what you'll receive will be a total surprise!
 

 
What We Need
Our project goal is US$7,000 but our real goal is really US$10,000... I know it is a lot of money to make this tiny pen but this is the bare minimum amount for me to start the production of this project and to get the XStylus into your hands.  This cost includes the cost of the production moulds, ""304 stainless steel"" screws, sourcing and trial of the raw materials, the cost of the silicon mould for the initial prototypes, shipping charges etc...
 
As a cost of fundraising on IndieGoGo, I'm expecting to pay US$700-1000 in commission, exchange rate fees and transaction fees to IndieGoGo and Paypal.  So, I'd really end up with just around US$6,000-9,000 for everything else, depending on how much I raise in 60 days.
 
By lowering my goal, I'm trying to minimize my risk (IndieGoGo takes 9% instead of 4% if my goal is not reached before the deadline).  Looking at the bright side, once US$7000 is reached, I will start production so that the XStylus Crayons can reach you sooner.
 


Other Ways You Can Help
How can we get people interested in this project?  Please help us spread the word to people you know who are performance driven in their gaming experience.  Please facebook us, tweet about us and share your support with your circle of Nintendo friends!
 
 
Calling for Reviewers:
 
We are currently looking for established game reviewers who'd be interested in using this pen in their video reviews.  If you would like to test run this pen in your upcoming game review, please send me an e-mail with a link to your website or blog. I'd be happy to hear from you.

<p><span style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">We’re a small company residing in the town of Hudiksvall in northern Sweden at the moment. We have a passion for games and hope to make it into the market with this, our first real game: Tales n' Tactics. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">We started development in the fall of 2012, our programmer having dabbled with games before but nothing serious, and decided on creating a turn-based strategy game in the spirit of Heroes of Might and Magic II / III. We felt like it would be a great learning experience aswell as a way to, maybe, gain a foothold within the industry and tie some important connections. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">But what we didn't expect was that it would turn out as big as what it has become. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">It has been quite the experience, to say the least. Maybe not always, there has been some ups and downs, but we've managed this far. What's stopping us from our goal? Time-constraints and, of course, money. That's one of the main reasons we decided to try our luck in Indiegogo, where people might see our dream in the same light as we do.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">Each turn is half a day long, meaning there is one ""Day""-turn followed up by a ""Night-turn"", and days are organized into cycles of weeks and months (measured as four weeks). While on the world-map, a player may endevour in several different things, like capturing towns, clearing dungeons, clearing out and taking over resource locations, upgrading exsisting towns, trading with other players or you can just go off exploring.. Which can be just as rewarding.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class=""mw-editsection""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://arcanewrench.com/indiegogo/TnT_turn_based_combat.png"" src="""" style=""""/></span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">Whenever a player engages in battle, the game changes from the world map to the battlefield view, which is based on a square grid. In this view, the player will engage another player, or an NPC's, army in strategic combat. Combat will only end with the losing army being destroyed or, if the battle is against another player, the losing player may able to pay a heavy price in resources to surrender. Surrendering allows the defeated to keep the remaining units intact as well as his Champion.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">Creatures in an army are represented by stacks of units, each of which consists of a single type of creature, in any quantity. There are room for eight different stacks per Champion, which means you will have to decide what kind of army you want to construct.  Champions do not engage in combat directly  but do passively grant bonuses to their army, depending on their defence and attack levels.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">Even though you can affect most things while in combat there are still several things that are somewhat ""random"". Damage done by creatures is one factor that could be considered random, as every unit has an attack-span, e.g ""Knight does between 7 and 10 damage"". Some units also have a chance to apply an effect, like ""Frozen"", ""Burning"", ""Haunted"" to name a few. This effect is also applied in a somewhat random manner as units have a percentual chance of applying said effects.</span></p>
<h3><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.arcanewrench.com/indiegogo/TnT_settlements.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">Every player can capture and defend three types of <strong>settlements</strong>; <strong>Outposts</strong>, <strong>Villages</strong> and <strong>cities</strong>. Outposts have a single buildplot. Villages have a total of three buildplots and Cities have four buildplots.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">On each buildplot the player can choose to build either a battle-, trade-, upgrade- or special-oriented structure.<br/>In every settlement, it’s possible to build a maximum of one structure from each category.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>In <strong>battle structures</strong> you can train three types of units. The players can upgrade their trade structures for an increased value for traded in goods.</li>
<li>In <strong>upgrade structures</strong> you can purchase upgrades that i.e. improve the attacks and armor of you units.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">The bottom part of the interface provides the player with the possibility to rearrange its units.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">Some people enjoy playing hand-crafted scenarios by themselves. Some would rather experience it with <strong>friends</strong>! </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">You wouldn't play chess, or battleships, alone.. would you?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">This is why we decided to include not only online, <strong>peer-to-peer multiplayer</strong>, but also the classic <strong>Hot-seat multiplayer</strong>!<br/><br/>For those that have not heard the term ""Hot-seat multiplayer"" before, here's a short explanation:<br/><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;""><strong>""Hotseat</strong> or <strong>hot seat</strong> is a multiplayer mode provided by some turn-based video games, which allows two or more players to play on the same device by taking turns playing the game.

<p><span style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;""><strong>There are many different types of dungeons in Tales n' Tactics, and most of them are layered.</strong><br/>A layered dungeon has three layers:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>The Outside</strong>, this acts just like any other encounter on the worldmap (as in there may be rain, snow, etc.) except that it may contain different units.</li>
<li>
<strong>The Inside</strong>, this may have some remnants of the outside weather and climate; puddles of water, some fog dragging against the floor.</li>
<li>
<strong>The Core</strong>, this is the toughest part of the dungeon and may contain very rare creatures. When you have defeated the last living creatures in the dungeon; Fortune will be yours!</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">Somewhere between a week and a month after the dungeon has been cleared, some new foes may have found their residence within it. Or who knows, maybe something entirely different.. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 14px;"">But there are more encounters than just dungeons.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;""><strong>Events</strong> are another type of encounter, which can occur practically anywhere while travelling.<br/>An encounter will give you several different options to solve a problem and will, of course, reward you differently depending on what you do.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">Let's say you are travelling through the woods with your army. You suddenly encounter a band of travelling monks on a pilgrimage, what do you do?<br/><br/></span></p>
<ul>
<li>You give them some resources to continue their travels.</li>
<li>You force them to tell you any arcane secrets they might possess.</li>
<li>You attack them without mercy, it'll be some great practice for your army</li>
<li>
<em>&lt;You have a monk in your army&gt; </em>You convince them to join you.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">Depending on you choice you may gain more followers to you army, lose others because of your ruthlessness or show piety and maybe gain something else down the road.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">On the world-map, you can use your champions to clear out and capture mines, farms and lumbermills. These can then be managed to attain resources:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>mine</strong> can produce <strong>stone</strong> or <strong>metal</strong>.</li>
<li>A <strong>lumbermill</strong> can produce <strong>wood</strong>.</li>
<li>A <strong>farm</strong> can produce <strong>food</strong> or <strong>cloth</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">Said resources, plus certain ones you will only find in dungeons, will then be used to build and upgrade structures and settlements and to enhance your army or purchase units.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">You will also be able to <strong>trade resources</strong> with your fellow players or with NPCs, if you had an unlucky creation of your worldmap for an example. </span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">The <strong>gallery</strong> is your own little showcase where you can browse through all the monsters you have encountered during your travels, and contains everything from the smallest imp to the largest yeti.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">There are currently, that is before and during this Indiegogo-campaign, <strong>98 units</strong> which can be fought. (Although there are still some serious balancing in need of doing, of course.)</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">These creatures can then be placed on your personally created maps in the adventure editor as creatures in dungeons and events.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">In your towns ""smithy"", or equivalent building, you can <strong>purchase upgrades</strong> which increases your units <strong>attack</strong>, <strong>defence</strong> or <strong>movement</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">Whether it is stronger steel, enhanced leatherwork for your armouring or better boots for your units to use, rest assured.. By using all that precious loot, your army will grow stronger over time.</span></p>

<h3><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://arcanewrench.com/indiegogo/TnT_effects.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">There are more things in this world than upgrades though, there are also <strong>traits</strong>! There are two kind of traits; Racial traits and Individual traits.<br/><br/></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Racial traits</strong> are traits that are the same for the entire race, like ""Stocky"" for dwarves, ""Ferocious"" for orcs or ""Terrifying"" for the Undead. A race typically has one positive and one negative racial effect.</li>
<li>
<strong>Individual traits</strong> differ from unit to unit but includes, but is not limited to: Flying, Fire Weakness, Retaliating, Marsh Lungs, Ice cold, Fearless, Holy.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">On top of that there are also <strong>status effects</strong>.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Some monsters can apply status effects to their opponents, like Poison and Burning. These do different things depending on what kind of resistances, if any, the opponent has.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://arcanewrench.com/indiegogo/TnT_nightday_cycles.png"" src="""" style=""""/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">Every round of the game the players will have to take in account several factors: Is it night? Is it raining outside? Will the terrain I'm currently hold up on grant me benefits or make my army frail and easy to crush?<br/><br/>Currently, our setup is this:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Some units will have better sight in darkness, increasing attack/defence/movement by a fair bit, while other will have trouble seeing in the dark and be affected in the opposite manner.</li>
<li>Some units (Think, water-based creatures while raining) will be granted benefits while there is a weather effect going on, if it's raining, snowing, if fog envelops the terrain, that kind of thing.</li>
<li>Some units will also be granted benefits depending on what kind of terrain they are positioned on, Ents while stationed on grass would be an example.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;""><br/>Which means if you're really unlucky and your enemy has prepared well; his inferior army can still <strong>triumph</strong> over you by his use of clever <strong>tactics</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;""> </span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 14px;"">The Tales n' Tactics soundtrack will feature several different genres of instrumental music, reflecting the medieval style of the game. However, all tracks will have a unifying 8-bit/retro feel to them that will fit the pixel art perfectly.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 14px;""><span>The music is being written by veteran game composer, Richard McDonald, who has worked in the games industry for many years.

<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Q: ""Retro"" graphics, why?</h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">A: There are several different reasons why.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">First; We very much enjoy that style ourselves, it brings back good memories and one can really be astounded what can be done in such low-resolution imagery.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Second; Money. Time. If we were to make this game in full HD and still make it look good.. We'd need waay more money.<br/><br/>""So why are you not asking for more money?"" You might ask. Well, as stated above; We like this art style. Quite a lot. More people on the team might also end in the project not turning out the way we want it to. Not have the right feel to it.<br/>We're also realists. We don't expect people to throw money at us, for an idea we are not even sure people will enjoy, but we have high hopes!</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""> </p>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Q: Why crowdfunding?</h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">A: As a two-man team with no games previously in our portfolio, we felt like we didn't have a whole lot of choice in the matter. </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">As crowdfunding is something where each and every one gets to decide by themselves if they feel that it's something worth investing a small amount of money into, it suits an indie-game like ""Tales n' Tactics"" perfectly.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""> </p>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Q: What happens if you do not reach your goal?</h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">A: This game will be completed even if we do not reach our funding goal, but it will probably take more time as we'll have to figure out some other source(s) of income, and we the editors and simulators will probably be a little less deep and, worst case, we'll have to scrap our idea of a future campaign.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""> </p>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Q: Are there any boxed/physical copies?</h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">A: If we get enough support; Sure, there might be, but there are no plans for it as of right now.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""> </p>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Q: Where does my money go?</h3>
<p><img alt=""Piechart"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.arcanewrench.com/indiegogo/TnT_piechart.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Piechart""/></p>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Q: About the rewards.. Do I get to create ANYTHING?</h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">A: When we say ""of your choosing"", we give you the power to add anything. But let's say.. You wanted Isaac clarke from ""Dead Space"" as a portrait; This is not something that fits together with the game's setting, which means it will have to be an ""easter egg"" of a kind, like a rare chance to get that specific portrait when you choose among them. We do this to keep the immersion at a reasonable level.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Oh, and no obscenity either.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""> </p>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Q: Why are there so many perks/tiers?</h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">A: Indiegogo is a wonderful place, a place where people from across the globe can come together and back whichever project they feel suit them. But, unfortunatly, not everybody have the same funds and cannot back everything they might want. That's why we have so many tiers, so everybody can find the one they feel suit themselves best.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""> </p>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Q: What was your inspiration?</h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">A: Primarily: Heroes of Might and Magic I-&gt;III, Warlords I-II, Travian (Yes, really!), Civilization and King's Bounty.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""> </p>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Q: What's ""DRM""?</h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">A:<strong> Digital rights management</strong><span>, or </span><strong>DRM</strong><span>, is a general term used to describe any type of technology that aims to stop, or at least ease, the practice of piracy.<span> In essence, DRM removes usage control from the person in possession of digital content and puts it in the hands of a computer program.</span></span></p>

<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;""><span>Q: I want to contribute but I do not have any funds/ I do not use paypal, what can I do?</span></h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">A: If that is the case, which it totally understandable, you could:</p>

Conquer towns, clear dungeons or just explore the randomly generated maps. Each game can be won by completing certain objectives which are generated randomly for you or that you have chosen yourself in the beginning of a game. You can play either alone or with your friends, on one computer via hot seat-mode or online! All this is presented in cozy, retro graphics with fitting “old-school” music.


We’re a small company residing in the town of Hudiksvall in northern Sweden at the moment. We have a passion for games and hope to make it into the market with this, our first real game: Tales n' Tactics. 
We started development in the fall of 2012, our programmer having dabbled with games before but nothing serious, and decided on creating a turn-based strategy game in the spirit of Heroes of Might and Magic II / III. We felt like it would be a great learning experience aswell as a way to, maybe, gain a foothold within the industry and tie some important connections. 
But what we didn't expect was that it would turn out as big as what it has become. 
It has been quite the experience, to say the least. Maybe not always, there has been some ups and downs, but we've managed this far. What's stopping us from our goal? Time-constraints and, of course, money. That's one of the main reasons we decided to try our luck in Indiegogo, where people might see our dream in the same light as we do.
 






Each turn is half a day long, meaning there is one ""Day""-turn followed up by a ""Night-turn"", and days are organized into cycles of weeks and months (measured as four weeks). While on the world-map, a player may endevour in several different things, like capturing towns, clearing dungeons, clearing out and taking over resource locations, upgrading exsisting towns, trading with other players or you can just go off exploring.. Which can be just as rewarding.

Whenever a player engages in battle, the game changes from the world map to the battlefield view, which is based on a square grid. In this view, the player will engage another player, or an NPC's, army in strategic combat. Combat will only end with the losing army being destroyed or, if the battle is against another player, the losing player may able to pay a heavy price in resources to surrender. Surrendering allows the defeated to keep the remaining units intact as well as his Champion.
Creatures in an army are represented by stacks of units, each of which consists of a single type of creature, in any quantity. There are room for eight different stacks per Champion, which means you will have to decide what kind of army you want to construct.  Champions do not engage in combat directly  but do passively grant bonuses to their army, depending on their defence and attack levels.
Even though you can affect most things while in combat there are still several things that are somewhat ""random"". Damage done by creatures is one factor that could be considered random, as every unit has an attack-span, e.g ""Knight does between 7 and 10 damage"". Some units also have a chance to apply an effect, like ""Frozen"", ""Burning"", ""Haunted"" to name a few. This effect is also applied in a somewhat random manner as units have a percentual chance of applying said effects.

Every player can capture and defend three types of settlements; Outposts, Villages and cities. Outposts have a single buildplot. Villages have a total of three buildplots and Cities have four buildplots.
On each buildplot the player can choose to build either a battle-, trade-, upgrade- or special-oriented structure.In every settlement, it’s possible to build a maximum of one structure from each category.

In battle structures you can train three types of units. The players can upgrade their trade structures for an increased value for traded in goods.
In upgrade structures you can purchase upgrades that i.e. improve the attacks and armor of you units.

The bottom part of the interface provides the player with the possibility to rearrange its units.

In the editor players can build maps and create adventures to share with other players. The editor provides all the tools to make as feature packed adventures as the Campaign. Here players can create trigger points for special plot events such as a champion speaking or a part of the story being told. 

Some people enjoy playing hand-crafted scenarios by themselves. Some would rather experience it with friends! 
You wouldn't play chess, or battleships, alone.. would you?
This is why we decided to include not only online, peer-to-peer multiplayer, but also the classic Hot-seat multiplayer!For those that have not heard the term ""Hot-seat multiplayer"" before, here's a short explanation:
""Hotseat or hot seat is a multiplayer mode provided by some turn-based video games, which allows two or more players to play on the same device by taking turns playing the game. The name hotseat started as a reference to playing a PC game and trading seats with the other player.""(source)

There are many different types of dungeons in Tales n' Tactics, and most of them are layered.A layered dungeon has three layers:


The Outside, this acts just like any other encounter on the worldmap (as in there may be rain, snow, etc.) except that it may contain different units.

The Inside, this may have some remnants of the outside weather and climate; puddles of water, some fog dragging against the floor.

The Core, this is the toughest part of the dungeon and may contain very rare creatures. When you have defeated the last living creatures in the dungeon; Fortune will be yours!

Somewhere between a week and a month after the dungeon has been cleared, some new foes may have found their residence within it. Or who knows, maybe something entirely different.. 
But there are more encounters than just dungeons.
Events are another type of encounter, which can occur practically anywhere while travelling.An encounter will give you several different options to solve a problem and will, of course, reward you differently depending on what you do.
Let's say you are travelling through the woods with your army. You suddenly encounter a band of travelling monks on a pilgrimage, what do you do?

You give them some resources to continue their travels.
You force them to tell you any arcane secrets they might possess.
You attack them without mercy, it'll be some great practice for your army

<You have a monk in your army> You convince them to join you.

Depending on you choice you may gain more followers to you army, lose others because of your ruthlessness or show piety and maybe gain something else down the road.
 

On the world-map, you can use your champions to clear out and capture mines, farms and lumbermills. These can then be managed to attain resources:

A mine can produce stone or metal.
A lumbermill can produce wood.
A farm can produce food or cloth.

Said resources, plus certain ones you will only find in dungeons, will then be used to build and upgrade structures and settlements and to enhance your army or purchase units.
You will also be able to trade resources with your fellow players or with NPCs, if you had an unlucky creation of your worldmap for an example. 

The gallery is your own little showcase where you can browse through all the monsters you have encountered during your travels, and contains everything from the smallest imp to the largest yeti.
There are currently, that is before and during this Indiegogo-campaign, 98 units which can be fought. (Although there are still some serious balancing in need of doing, of course.)
These creatures can then be placed on your personally created maps in the adventure editor as creatures in dungeons and events.
 

In your towns ""smithy"", or equivalent building, you can purchase upgrades which increases your units attack, defence or movement.
Whether it is stronger steel, enhanced leatherwork for your armouring or better boots for your units to use, rest assured.. By using all that precious loot, your army will grow stronger over time.
 

There are more things in this world than upgrades though, there are also traits! There are two kind of traits; Racial traits and Individual traits.


Racial traits are traits that are the same for the entire race, like ""Stocky"" for dwarves, ""Ferocious"" for orcs or ""Terrifying"" for the Undead. A race typically has one positive and one negative racial effect.

Individual traits differ from unit to unit but includes, but is not limited to: Flying, Fire Weakness, Retaliating, Marsh Lungs, Ice cold, Fearless, Holy.

On top of that there are also status effects.

Some monsters can apply status effects to their opponents, like Poison and Burning. These do different things depending on what kind of resistances, if any, the opponent has.

 

Every round of the game the players will have to take in account several factors: Is it night? Is it raining outside? Will the terrain I'm currently hold up on grant me benefits or make my army frail and easy to crush?Currently, our setup is this:

Some units will have better sight in darkness, increasing attack/defence/movement by a fair bit, while other will have trouble seeing in the dark and be affected in the opposite manner.
Some units (Think, water-based creatures while raining) will be granted benefits while there is a weather effect going on, if it's raining, snowing, if fog envelops the terrain, that kind of thing.
Some units will also be granted benefits depending on what kind of terrain they are positioned on, Ents while stationed on grass would be an example.

Which means if you're really unlucky and your enemy has prepared well; his inferior army can still triumph over you by his use of clever tactics.
 

The Tales n' Tactics soundtrack will feature several different genres of instrumental music, reflecting the medieval style of the game. However, all tracks will have a unifying 8-bit/retro feel to them that will fit the pixel art perfectly.
The music is being written by veteran game composer, Richard McDonald, who has worked in the games industry for many years. You can listen to more of his work at his website.


The ALPHA trailer at top uses the Dwarf City Theme and above are two preview tracks.
Q: ""Retro"" graphics, why?
A: There are several different reasons why.
First; We very much enjoy that style ourselves, it brings back good memories and one can really be astounded what can be done in such low-resolution imagery.
Second; Money. Time. If we were to make this game in full HD and still make it look good.. We'd need waay more money.""So why are you not asking for more money?"" You might ask. Well, as stated above; We like this art style. Quite a lot. More people on the team might also end in the project not turning out the way we want it to. Not have the right feel to it.We're also realists. We don't expect people to throw money at us, for an idea we are not even sure people will enjoy, but we have high hopes!
 
Q: Why crowdfunding?
A: As a two-man team with no games previously in our portfolio, we felt like we didn't have a whole lot of choice in the matter. 
As crowdfunding is something where each and every one gets to decide by themselves if they feel that it's something worth investing a small amount of money into, it suits an indie-game like ""Tales n' Tactics"" perfectly.
 
Q: What happens if you do not reach your goal?
A: This game will be completed even if we do not reach our funding goal, but it will probably take more time as we'll have to figure out some other source(s) of income, and we the editors and simulators will probably be a little less deep and, worst case, we'll have to scrap our idea of a future campaign.
 
Q: Are there any boxed/physical copies?
A: If we get enough support; Sure, there might be, but there are no plans for it as of right now.
 
Q: Where does my money go?

Q: About the rewards.. Do I get to create ANYTHING?
A: When we say ""of your choosing"", we give you the power to add anything. But let's say.. You wanted Isaac clarke from ""Dead Space"" as a portrait; This is not something that fits together with the game's setting, which means it will have to be an ""easter egg"" of a kind, like a rare chance to get that specific portrait when you choose among them. We do this to keep the immersion at a reasonable level.
Oh, and no obscenity either.
 
Q: Why are there so many perks/tiers?
A: Indiegogo is a wonderful place, a place where people from across the globe can come together and back whichever project they feel suit them. But, unfortunatly, not everybody have the same funds and cannot back everything they might want. That's why we have so many tiers, so everybody can find the one they feel suit themselves best.
 
Q: What was your inspiration?
A: Primarily: Heroes of Might and Magic I->III, Warlords I-II, Travian (Yes, really!), Civilization and King's Bounty.
 
Q: What's ""DRM""?
A: Digital rights management, or DRM, is a general term used to describe any type of technology that aims to stop, or at least ease, the practice of piracy. In essence, DRM removes usage control from the person in possession of digital content and puts it in the hands of a computer program.

Q: I want to contribute but I do not have any funds/ I do not use paypal, what can I do?
A: If that is the case, which it totally understandable, you could:

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey all.  SGM Socharis here.  With the chaos of everything going on this year, we didn't have a SimuCon, and that's a shame!  This campaign is exclusively to raise money to have an Un(official)Con this year.  Since it's so late in the year already, the date of the event is in late September (the 26th-29th).  The good news is, it's less likely to be super hot and muggy!</p>
<p>We're taking a different tack on financing the Con this year.  Previously, it's been a paid event - everybody gets a badge, there are scheduled events, and no one is allowed into events without paying up first.</p>
<p>The downside of this model is that in addition to the travel costs to end up in St. Louis and the price of booking a hotel room, you also had to pay an additional fee to attend.  Although it's worked out in the past, the tighter economy has made it harder for many players to justify the cost of attending.</p>
<p>As such, I'm trying out a new model, and with some luck and passion this can be the way we do it in the future, too.  This year, we're not going to charge anything to attend.  Everybody can come and fully enjoy all the festivities without worrying about who has paid.</p>
<p>Not having to pay is great, but it also means we can't afford to give awesome goodies to every attendee.  Badges, mugs, t-shirts, etc were some of the perks for the $100 (or $300) tickets in the past, but since we're trying a more basic model, we're making it possible to chip in smaller amounts and get these things as rewards. </p>
<h3>Dates and Lodging</h3>
<p>UnCon 2013 will be held at the <strong>Westport Chalet</strong> (St. Louis, MO) on <strong>September 26-29, 2013</strong>.  We have the conference room starting at 6pm on Friday, Sept 27, through Sunday, Sept 29 at 2pm.</p>
<p>Visit the <a href=""https://www.starwoodmeeting.com/StarGroupsWeb/booking/reservation?id=1307267080&amp;key=47250"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_parent"" title=""Hote Website"">Hotel Website </a>to get our special group rate of $95/night at the Chalet.  For such a nice hotel, this is a pretty good deal.</p>
<p><strong>We've met our goal!  </strong>Awesome!  Donations will be open through September 5th to give everybody a chance to get badges and whatever else they're interested in.  Excess funds will go into stocking the hospitality room with food and such!</p>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>After you choose a perk, I'll send you an email to get the details on the perks you've chosen.</p>
<p>If you want to customize your perks a little bit by adding sweet sweet loots, just donate the commensurate amount extra:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extra Badge - $5</li>
<li>Extra Shirt - $20</li>
<li>Extra Mug - $25</li>
</ul>
<h3>Trust</h3>
<p>In the past, unofficial events have faced some challenges with respect to how the money was used.  Thankfully, this event is as official as an unofficial event can be.  To help bring a greater authenticity to this effort, I've listed my best estimates of the costs.  Additionally, Indiegogo guarantees that if we don't meet our funding goal, everyone will get their money back.  They require a minimum of $500 for any campaign, so any extra money left over after room and swag expenses will be reserved for food at the Con.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Costs</h3>
<ul>
<li>4% IndieGogoFees:  $20+ (based on how much is raised)</li>
<li>Conference Rooms:  $200 + 15% tax.  Total:  $230</li>
<li>Rewards:  $150 (estimate, depending on which rewards people choose and bulk discounts)</li>
<li>Food:  Whatever remains after this is all covered.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you aren't inspired by any of the perks, or just want to come and have a good time, spread the word!  The hotel is willing to work with us if we end up bigger than we anticipated, so let's see if we can get a party going!</p>
<p>Also, if you don't want to come to the event but still want to contribute, please do!  We can make arrangements to have your swag delivered.</p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Short Summary</span><br/></p> <p>In the 70's and 80's, RPG box sets with booklets were all the rage. In recent years, many game publishers have shifted to publishing 200+ page RPG hardbacks instead of the much-beloved booklet format of prior years. Hardbacks have a great shelf-life, but many of us miss the convenience of smaller books which have streamlined mechanics and easily lay flat the game table. </p>
<p>We've been waiting for the 5e OGL/SRD for some time, and had this secret project already in the works! This project leverages OGL content to create two 8.5x11"" booklets — a Player's Guide and a Gamemaster's Guide — each between 36-44 pages, which together form a complete RPG system that is fully 5e compatible. There are four standard classes: Fighter, Wizard, Cleric, and Thief and the game can advance those characters up to level 15.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">While we have some of the art already commissioned and done, we are seeking funding to create additional art and text content for this exciting product!</span></p>
<ul> <li>
<b>Backers get PDF copies as well as print-at-cost codes from DriveThroughRPG. </b>You can get hard copies at cost; you just need to pay shipping! Costs for backers to back this project and print at cost will be cheaper than retail costs after the project ends.</li> <li>
<b>We also plan to offer you a Kit — a PDF, cover file, and instructions — that lets you you print these booklets at cost at any other printer you choose! </b>For example, you can print several copies at Lulu.com or Kinkos, and get the in booklet, spiral, or hardback format!</li>
<li>
<b>We also will enable you to customize the look and feel of the cover. </b>To that end, we will soon be announcing a contest to design additional booklet cover designs — you can use one of these alternate covers from the contest, or even create your own! We'll give you some templates in OpenOffice/LibreOffice to customize the cover for your personal printing. </li>
<li>
<b>Is it a box? </b>No, we call it 'Red Box RPG' to harken back to the various box set RPGs of the 70's and 80's, but this project is producing the two game booklets only. We will have a <i>separate</i> project later in the year to produce a 'White Box RPG' that actually WILL have a box!</li>

<h3>FAQs</h3>
<div>
<p><i><b>Question:</b> What exactly IS Dungeonesque?</i></p>
<p><b>Answer:</b> Dungeonesque is a concise version of 5e using a retro layout (white pages, clean design) and styled after 70s and 80s boxed set games. There will be a Red Box (8.5x11"", two booklet) version and a White Box (5.5x8.5"", three booklet) version of the core rules, along with a physical box for the White Box edition.  This project is for the Red Box version.</p>
<p><i><b>Question:</b> What is the advantage of using the Dungeonesque booklets vs. the current hardback books from WOTC?</i></p>
<p><b>Answer:</b> There's a few things we're striving for:</p>
<p><i>Usability: </i>In my day job I have been a human-centered-design expert for many years. Table-top ergonomics are a big focus for me. I want the content to be easy to scan, easy to understand, and easy to thumb through to find the content you want. To that end, we'll experiment with tricks like putting key tables and an index on the back cover.</p>
<p><i>Hackability: </i>These books have black-and-white interiors. And they're inexpensive. Write in the margins. Print a custom version of the PDF that has some additional charts and tables you've made for your campaign and add then to the back. Slap a cool custom book cover that gets designed in a cover design contest that we'll soon kick-off. Then get the final product spiral-bound at a local printer. Hack these booklets, and use them like you want!</p>
<p><i>Providing an inexpensive, high-production-value tool for new players: </i>One of the things I've loved about Savage Worlds is their inexpensive $10 rulebook. We want to allow that same, low-cost freedom. Have a new player to the game? You can have a stack of low-cost Dungeonesque Player's Guides you can hand out like candy. You can print them through DriveThruRPG, or print them at home. We'll have special low-ink covers that will look great even if you're printing at home and getting Kinko's to spiral bind the books.</p>
<p><i>Mixing booklets and traditional hardback handbooks at the same table: </i>One of our top goals is to make the Dungeonesque Player's Guide and Gamemaster's Guide interoperable with the other 5e core books already published. For my part, I'll use Wizard's DMG for certain activities when I prepare for a game, but the Dungeonesque Gamemaster's Guide will be my go-to tool for use during the game. My players will use a mix of traditional hardback PHBs with one or two having a Dungeonesque Player's Guide. It all works together.</p>
<p><i><b>Question:</b> Why not just print out the WOTC 5e Basic Rules?</i></p>
<p><b>Answer:</b> The 5e Basic Rules published by WOTC are great and certainly are useful for printing. They clock in at 115 pages, have no cover, and no interior art. Dungeonesque will provide a streamlined alternative set of rules that run around 40 pages, have interior art, and a beautiful cover (and in fact, we'll make sure you have multiple, beautiful cover options). Both products cover the same set of rules.</p>
<p><i><b>Question:</b> What is the difference between the Dungeonesque rules and the full set of rules in the SRD at <a href=""http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd?"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd?</a></i></p>
<p><b>Answer:</b> The <i>exact</i> contents are written in pencil, not pen, and the final contents may flex a bit as we experiment with copy and art layouts. But the current plan is this:</p>
<p><i>For the Player's Guide:</i></p>
<p>We have reduced scope to just a few races (Human, Elf, Dwarf, Halfling, etc.), and four classes (Fighter, Wizard, Cleric, and Thief).</p>
<p>We've reduced the level support to 1-15 instead of 1-20. Those higher levels add lots of complexity in terms of word count, spell descriptions, etc.</p>
<p>We take a very old-school approach in terms of conciseness. A lot of content has been completely rewritten from the SRD, so even though it explains the same rule, we do it with fewer words. In many cases, the content is 1/8 the size of the SRD description of the same set of rules.</p>
<p><i>For the Gamemaster's Guide:</i></p>
<p>We'll have many of the expected tools, but we'll have a bigger focus on 'tools you need during the game' to support on-the-fly adventuring. The Bestiary will be concise, expressing stat blocks with 1/8 the text but conveying the same information (and, arguably more, since we'll add a 'tactics' section for spellcasters for example).</p>
<p>We're not changing any rules or in any way making this incompatible with the standard 5e rules, we're just having a very concise expression of those rules and adding some really cool tools and gaming aids.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>The vast majority of the text is complete. All that remains is some small additions to the GM's Guide, the choose-your-own-adventure text, and layout. We think we can deliver this project without problems.</p>
<p>However, as with any manufacturing process, things can go wrong. We have identified that delays in layout and delays in printer setup could happen. So we have allowed additional time in our schedule as a buffer to enable us to avoid such delay issues. If all goes as planned we may even be able to deliver the project a little sooner.</p>
<p>We understand the printing process as our founder has published several fiction and nonfiction books before and has worked with multiple printers. With projects like this there is nearly always something that costs more, so it makes business sense to have contingencies for this. We have built this into our costs.</p>
<p>Conventional crowdsourcing risks of fulfillment and printing are virtually nonexistent since we are using OneBookshelf's DriveThruRPG front end for printing and shipping on an at-cost basis for print-level backers. In the unlikely case that DriveThruRPG goes out of business, we have sufficient financial reserves to refund print backers the difference in pledge levels.</p>
<p>No matter what problems occur we will always keep our backers and supporters informed of any issues that arise so you will be aware of the situation and how we will be handling it.</p> </div> <div> <h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Spread The Word!</span></h3>

In recent years, many game publishers have shifted to publishing 200+ page RPG hardbacks instead of the much-beloved booklet format of prior years. Hardbacks have a great shelf-life, but many of us miss the convenience of smaller books which have streamlined mechanics and easily lay flat the game table. 
We've been waiting for the 5e OGL/SRD for some time, and had this secret project already in the works! This project leverages OGL content to create two 8.5x11"" booklets — a Player's Guide and a Gamemaster's Guide — each between 36-44 pages, which together form a complete RPG system that is fully 5e compatible. There are four standard classes: Fighter, Wizard, Cleric, and Thief and the game can advance those characters up to level 15.   What We Need & What You Get While we have some of the art already commissioned and done, we are seeking funding to create additional art and text content for this exciting product!
 
Backers get PDF copies as well as print-at-cost codes from DriveThroughRPG. You can get hard copies at cost; you just need to pay shipping! Costs for backers to back this project and print at cost will be cheaper than retail costs after the project ends. 
We also plan to offer you a Kit — a PDF, cover file, and instructions — that lets you you print these booklets at cost at any other printer you choose! For example, you can print several copies at Lulu.com or Kinkos, and get the in booklet, spiral, or hardback format!

We also will enable you to customize the look and feel of the cover. To that end, we will soon be announcing a contest to design additional booklet cover designs — you can use one of these alternate covers from the contest, or even create your own! We'll give you some templates in OpenOffice/LibreOffice to customize the cover for your personal printing. 

Is it a box? No, we call it 'Red Box RPG' to harken back to the various box set RPGs of the 70's and 80's, but this project is producing the two game booklets only. We will have a separate project later in the year to produce a 'White Box RPG' that actually WILL have a box!





Player's Guide
We will include all the rules and content needed to play the four standard races: Human, Elf, Dwarf, and Halfling. We will also support the four standard classes: Fighter, Wizard, Cleric, and Thief. We will include a choose-your-own-adventure style introductory game that is fun for learning or for solo play. Just like the original!

Gamemaster's Guide The Gamemaster's Guide will give you all the tools to run the game, including a bestiary. The guide also provides unique tools to make running dynamic, sandbox games and hex-crawls a breeze! Here is a sampling of some of the tools (space permitting) you can expect in the Gamemaster's Guide:

Bestiary
Concise Bestiary with easy-to-scan-and-use stat blocks that feel like 1e but are compatible with 5e! Here's a sample:DOPPELGANGER: HP 52 (8d8+16); AC 14; Atk 2 slam (+6 to hit, 7 (1d6+4) dmg); Speed 30'; Abilities Str +0, Dex +4, Con +2, Int +0, Wis +1, Cha +2; Perception 11; CR 3; XP 700; Special mimics shapes, immune to charmed condition, darkvision 60 ft., +10 (3d6) dmg on first attack if surprising opponent, reads thoughts.

Combat
Combat Outs, Critical Fail / Fumbles, Escalations, Hit Locations
People
Aristocrats, City NPCs, Contact Reactions, Motive / Needs, NPC Encounters, NPC Names, NPC Quirks, NPC Reactions, Relationships, Rules for Hirelings (wages, etc.)
Places
Businesses, Locations, Tavern Names, Town Names, Time & Tides, Weather & Hazards
Things
I Search the Body, Mundane Objects, Ship Names, Quick Traps
Treasure
Treasure Tables, Unique Magic Items, Books & Tomes, Curiosities (similar to Trinkets)

Rogue Comet is a new RPG company formed by fans of the hobby who want to create time-saving GM tools to make gaming easier. Together with a hoard of helpers and supporters we strive to create fantastic products for everyone! We just completed a very successful Kickstarter for 5e Adventures, and now look forward to expanding our product lines. While not part of this IndieGoGo project, we have a related future project on our roadmap to create a series of 5.5x8.5"" booklets and a box set RPG that has similar content to 'Dungeonesque: Red Box RPG' called 'Dungeonesque: White Box RPG' -- compatible rules and similar content but with smaller booklets. We plan on an entire line of booklet products to give you old-school tools you can use!

Are those even the same places? I guess there is only one way to find out""  Open world  - World of Ada is open for you to explore. You can choose whichever path you want as long as you can fight your way throu encountered enemies!  Fast travel - there are two fast travel mechanics in Ada, short and long distance. You can either teleport between crystals as a shortcut or move between whole zones. Hand crafted zones that are proceduraly put together - each play-through world of Ada is built differently, from carefuly handcrafted and designed zones. This way you can get unique experience without making it feel artificial and unimmersive. Random Encounters - while exploring world of Ada, you will run into many unexpected situations. Be prepared! Or... die!!!!!
ghouls feasting on preys be it animals or dead families, 
 traveling merchants, 
knowledgable priests,
bandits laying in ambush, 
monster lairs, 
post-war scenes,
and many more... uh... there's a lot of them!
 Some encounters change overtime. Friendly traveling merchants could become prey of ghouls or other vile creatures lurking around the world of Ada. Fast-paced skill based combat - Combat in Ada is based on combination of basic attack routine with secondary skill of your choice and potions/consumables. No fight could end well without proper movement and dodging. Dark Crystals - most attacks in Ada requires  Dark Crystals, you can get them by attacking enemies. Ragelike mechanic  used for everything (also spells)Basic combat mechanics

 Defensive skills - shield yourself, heal yourself, get invisible for a brief amount of time, turn foes against each other and much more.
 Items - throw potions, plant seeds, send animated skulls at enemies... and more!
       Every enemy in Ada is carefully designed to bring the highest  amount of fair difficulty to game. They are unique both visually and mechanic wise. Some will attack you alone with big combos or huge swings, other will be fast, agile and evade your attack while some may group up to get you with numbers. No matter what enemy type are you facing you always need to focus or else it may go really wrong. Some enemies will jump at you from hiding or spawn as you disturb their nest. Be aware as you never know from which direction the danger will come. Ranks of monsters is constantly growing not only in sheer numbers, but also in variety. Player can run into undeads, vicious beasts, local tribesmen, creepy insects or ancients. Enemies in Ada does not end here. Once you get deep enough you will find out that there is something more. Something far more dangerous than what you have seen. Prepare for epic encounters with main and side bosses that are fitting for the zone you are exploring. Some you must face, while others could be skipped, but remember: with great danger comes great reward. Face all challenges to come as not-so-brave tomb raider.""Being thrown into gruesome and cruel world as a fragile  girl is harsh, especially that you never would have guessed what will come."" Ada may feel out of place, but this is what she has to do. While progressing throughout the story you will find out where she come from, why is she here and what her destiny is. Unlock and upgrade skills as you go. Choose from handful of amazing abilities that will be crutial for defeating tougher enemies.Once you unlock the skill you can upgrade it to get more slots to put your infusion orbs in. Each and every upgrade comes with different effect. From basic ones like boosting damage, range or speed to advanced ones like players after image, flaming footsteps or defense shield. Equip those that suit you best. Or just slash everything with basic attack. No matter what you choose the world will be againts you. Becouse you are an outsider. ""It always amazes me how leaves, roots and blood of a rodent turn into weapons of mass destruction.""Use alchemy to create useful potions. Some may be used to heal, boost  up abilities or can be thrown at enemies to harm, confuse, stun or even  turn them against each other. Collect herbs, crystals, vials and all kind of ingredients to create  powerful potions. Each of them comes in different sizes, and as we know  the bigger the size, the stronger the explosion.  Some potions could be even used to interact with environment. To burn things down or freeze up the water. Who knows what that might mean for you and exploring the world of Ada.  Every story needs to start somewhere. This is where you meet Ada and as much as you'd want her to have a normal, happy life it is just not possible in this land, in this time, in this world. Any job would be better than that. But what if that is the only one...""I should have never entered these ruins. Well, no one  could ever change Madys mind?"" ""Something was terribly wrong.""Things always worked out. Somehow.

<p>Conquer Mars is a multiplayer game of massive drone armies and cunning strategy designed with the goal of having a lot of fun whether you win or lose.</p>
<p>Win the game with the best strategy; outmaneuver your opponents with the best tactics, and convince the other players to fight each other instead of you.</p>
<p>All the unnecessary micro-management has been cut out. No hidden map or fog of war that demands tedious scouting. No placing of buildings and sentry towers. Build 20 units at a time for each mine you control, base-building limited to upgrades and defensive towers, and a gameplay focused on armies rather than individual units. It’s build and go!</p>
<p>This makes Conquer Mars more like a fast-paced game of Chess or Risk, but with 8 players and explosions.<br/><br/></p>

<p>We are a small, self-funded indie studio called <a href=""http://www.zerobloodgames.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Zero Blood Games"">Zero Blood Games</a> with just two people, Jonas and Thomas, who are both programmers by profession and aspiring game designers.</p>
<p>Conquer Mars has been our passion for the past many months, and we have hired freelancers to create quality art for the game and enlisted friends and family to help in any way possible to make Conquer Mars a reality.</p>
<p>To power Conquer Mars we have created our own 3D multiplayer game engine from scratch, implemented most of the gameplay and are well on our way to prove that we can pull off an ambitious project like this.</p>
<p>We have previously worked on big government and corporate projects, but we have always dreamed of making awesome games - and we hope that dream can come true with Conquer Mars.</p>
<p>This is a flexible funding campaign because we have already invested so much time and money in Conquer Mars that we will definitely release it - but the result of this campaign means a lot for how great the final game will be.</p>
<p><strong>So please help spread the word and make Conquer Mars all it can be :)</strong><br/><br/></p>

<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>A Giant Leap for Mankind</span></h3>
<p>In the early 2000s, discord and random acts of war and terror stole the headlines of newspapers and the minds of politicians. The first response was war, surveillance and suspicion, but results were meagre and indecisive. After a few decades, a series of financial meltdowns and several minor wars, the governments of the world were ready for a previously unseen level of cooperation. The Earth Assembly was formed in 2032 and under a transnational leadership the countries of the world saw peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>The force of this cooperative effort was too large for one planet and the nations formed the Solar Consortium in 2037. The Solar Consortium coordinated the fledgling space mining industries of the individual nations into a large, effective mining consortium. It built infrastructure and ensured effective tech and knowledge sharing, creating a massive mining operation that spanned moons, asteroids and the planet of Mars. Rare metals and minerals soon flowed to earth.</p>
<p>The Solar Consortium grew and expanded mining operations across the solar system, but on earth the Earth Assembly slowly deteriorated and it finally fell apart in 2068. Turmoil and wars claimed the attention and resources of the Earth nations once again and without the support and leadership from the Earth Assembly, the Solar Consortium fell apart as well.</p>
<p>By 2068 half a million people were living in space, and they had no intention of returning to Earth. Their homes were the capital control ships, colonies, mining squads and beam transporters that were built for the mining effort and the distribution of resources. No nation on Earth had the resources to claim the space mining corporations for their own and as the supply of metals and minerals was largely uninterrupted, they saw no need.</p>
<p>7 years after Solar Consortium disintegrated, they are still there, mining. On Mars the competition for the best mines is fierce. Rival corporations and rogue mining gangs fight over the mining facilities using droids and AI-controlled war machines, claiming the resources mined and beaming them to the Capital Control ships that remain the neutral backbone of the space mining infrastructure. Welcome to 2075. Welcome to Mars.<br/><br/></p>

<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>Premium membership</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The premium membership has three main benefits:</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><span>You earn game credits at 3x the speed of a free player, enabling you to unlock units and upgrades faster</span></p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><span>You get to build a greater variety of units in the game</span></p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><span>You can chat in public games</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>Alpha access</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>You get instant Alpha Access to play Conquer Mars when you support us!<br/>The game will be ready for hours of fun but the game will still have missing features. However,</span> you will be able to provide valuable feedback to the developers to help shape the game.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Starts: Instant (We send a key to your email within 8 hours) <br/>Duration: 1-3 months.</span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>Beta access</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>When Conquer Mars has all the essential features completed we will open up for beta access. The game will be more complete but you can still provide feedback and help shape the game in its final phase.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>When the game nears completion we will slowly open up for all alpha/beta players to invite new players to the game until Conquer Mars is ready for everyone.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Starts: When the Alpha ends.<br/>Duration: 2-3 months.</span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>Own the game / Instant unlocking of current and future units</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>You can unlock units either by paying with real money or in-game credits, but with instant unlocking you don’t have to spend anything on new units as they will be available to you as soon as we make them.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Everything that affects the gameplay will be immediately available to you - always. This is why it's called ""own the game"" :)</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>This doesn’t mean your hard earned in-game credits are useless though. We plan to make different visual upgrades and other things that don’t affect the gameplay which you can then spend your in-game credits on.</span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><strong>Special badges</strong></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>All players will have a badge associated with them, both in the lobby and in the game. We will probably even display them in 3D on the mines you control in the game. The special badges that you get here can only be obtained from this Indiegogo campaign.<br/></span></p>

<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>Wages</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Conquer Mars is designed and programmed by two people (Jonas and Thomas), and we really want to dedicate all our time to releasing the best possible game.</span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>Freelancers</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Most of the art is created by talented freelancers. This includes the 3D models, sound, music, and concept art.</span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>Servers</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Conquer Mars is an online multiplayer game at heart, so there always has to be servers available for you to play on. Making sure the servers can run 24x7 is what the premium membership helps pay for.</span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>Dreaming big</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Our dreams for Conquer Mars aren’t limited to what you see in this campaign. We’re just trying to be realistic. With enough support we would love to expand the story in the universe and create a campaign. We also want to make a version of Conquer Mars for tablets which we intend to make free for backers - but we only want to promise the things we know we can deliver.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span> </span></p>
<h2 dir=""ltr""><img alt=""Goals"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://r.playerio.com/r/profit-wars-mzpijllig0mgfyjovjmpg/Indiegogo/Titles/Headline_6.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Goals""/></h2>
<p>Everything in this list will be delivered if we reach the <strong>$100.000 goal</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Intelligent AI</strong><br/> We have a basic AI in Conquer Mars that is quite fun for beginners. But we need a much smarter AI that can play at all levels, utilize all units intelligently, use missiles and avoid them, defend or attack on multiple fronts and so on.</li>
<li>
<strong>Map editor</strong><br/> All the maps in Conquer Mars are currently auto-generated. This gives a nice variation, but it will be great to have player designed maps to play on.</li>
<li>
<strong>More units</strong><br/> We already have models and textures ready for two new units: Attack buggy and The Pincer. With your support we hope to supply a steady stream of cool new units for you to play.</li>
<li>
<strong>Replay and sharing</strong><br/> You know that awesome game where you were a total underdog, but still beat 7 other players with cunning and manipulation in a huge final battle? We have prototype functionality ready so you can replay that game, but we want to make a polished replay system for sharing online and even embed on your own website or blog.</li>
<li>
<strong>High scores, achievements, profiles, badges</strong><br/> You need to be able to customize your profile, select a badge to represent your style, get achievements for destroying the armies of your enemies and claim your spot on the high score charts.</li>
<li>
<strong>Friends list</strong><br/> Add your friends, invite them to games or send them chat messages. When spectator mode is available you can also follow your friends and follow the games they play.</li>
<li>
<strong>Ranking and matchmaking</strong><br/> Unlike many other games, Conquer Mars can still be a lot of fun when playing against players better than you. But it’s still better to be matched against players at roughly your level, so we need a ranking and matchmaking system to make sure you get the most fun out of playing. <br/> We also want to make a handicap system, so you can make games where players of different skill are automatically handicapped to give everyone a fair chance.</li>
<li>
<strong>Gameplay features</strong><br/> The gameplay in Conquer Mars works really well but there is still more to do. For example, we want you to be able to influence your fellow players by telling them to focus on a player who is starting to dominate. You may also have an idea for a great and necessary feature that we just have to get in the game before it’s released. Let us know!</li>
<li>
<strong>Balance and polish<br/></strong>Making Conquer Mars is a huge project just to make the basic 3D, multiplayer and gameplay. But it’s not worth much if the gameplay is unbalanced or there are too many bugs. We’re good at making bugfree and polished software, but it’s still a very time consuming process.</li>

<h3 dir=""ltr"">1000 followers on <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/conquermars"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a>: Spectator mode</h3>

<h3 dir=""ltr"">1000 likes on <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/conquermars"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a>: Team Play</h3>

<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>$125.000: Offline play</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Although Conquer Mars is an online multiplayer game at heart, it is still a lot of fun to play against just the AI. We will create an installable version of Conquer Mars where you can play against the AI when you are disconnected from the internet.</span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>$150.000: Tournaments</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Conquer Mars is perfect for making tournaments where spectators can watch the games live as they unfold. We will build the tools to host tournaments and we will also make it possible for you to arrange your own private tournaments in Conquer Mars.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>We also want to make it possible for you to embed Conquer Mars on your own website, if you want to build a special community or host a tournament. As long as people are playing Conquer Mars and nobody is trying something sleazy, we’re open to anything.</span></p>

<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>Game engine</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>To power Conquer Mars we have built our own game engine in ActionScript 3 for Flash and Stage3D. The engine is specifically built to handle thousands of units in a 3D multiplayer setting.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Handling lots of units means that many things have to be simpler, but we prefer to have very large armies of simple units rather than small detailed armies.</span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>Runs in your browser</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Conquer Mars is a Flash-based browser game, and it's optimized to be as small as possible. The entire game with models, textures, and sounds is under 7MB! The music streams in after the game has loaded.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The small size means that the game loads in seconds the first time, and your browser caches the game and then loads instantly the next time you want to play.</span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>Multiplayer tech</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">Conquer Mars is powered by <a href=""http://playerio.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Player.IO"">Player.IO</a>, a multiplayer game service recently acquired by Yahoo! We have worked with <a href=""http://chrisbenjaminsen.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Chris Benjaminsen"">Chris</a> and <a href=""http://oliverkofoed.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Oliver Kofoed Pedersen"">Oliver</a>, the founders of <a href=""http://playerio.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Player.IO"">Player.IO</a>, to make the multiplayer in Conquer Mars close to flawless.</p>

""The gameplay is fast and addictive and immediately makes you want to invite your friends to play for hours of fun.""

""It’s a great time sink and breath of fresh air compared to RTS games that try to needlessly over-complicate their mechanics""         - Indie Game Insider
""I’d strongly recommend this game to all strategists out there, 1) so they can enjoy the game and 2) so I have people to play against.""

         - Thirteen1

""Pulling off a successful pincer movement is as satisfying as ever, and there's something oddly cathartic about watching a sea of enemy tanks meet your own resulting in a spectacular array of explosions""

         - Digitally Downloaded

""This is supposed to tell you if this game has got some potential. And I'm here to say it does, and it deserves your money to support.""
         - RTS Guru
 


Conquer Mars is a multiplayer game of massive drone armies and cunning strategy designed with the goal of having a lot of fun whether you win or lose.
Win the game with the best strategy; outmaneuver your opponents with the best tactics, and convince the other players to fight each other instead of you.
All the unnecessary micro-management has been cut out. No hidden map or fog of war that demands tedious scouting. No placing of buildings and sentry towers. Build 20 units at a time for each mine you control, base-building limited to upgrades and defensive towers, and a gameplay focused on armies rather than individual units. It’s build and go!
This makes Conquer Mars more like a fast-paced game of Chess or Risk, but with 8 players and explosions.

Feel powerful when you beat your friends in massive 8 player battles

Insanity mode with thousands of units (example)

Play in seconds, under 7MB for the entire game including sound""Load times were indeed near nonexistent"" - Eurogamer.dk

Share replays with instant online playback to boast of your victories

Awesome post-game graphs and analytics for your inner nerd (example)

 

 

We are a small, self-funded indie studio called Zero Blood Games with just two people, Jonas and Thomas, who are both programmers by profession and aspiring game designers.
Conquer Mars has been our passion for the past many months, and we have hired freelancers to create quality art for the game and enlisted friends and family to help in any way possible to make Conquer Mars a reality.
To power Conquer Mars we have created our own 3D multiplayer game engine from scratch, implemented most of the gameplay and are well on our way to prove that we can pull off an ambitious project like this.
We have previously worked on big government and corporate projects, but we have always dreamed of making awesome games - and we hope that dream can come true with Conquer Mars.
This is a flexible funding campaign because we have already invested so much time and money in Conquer Mars that we will definitely release it - but the result of this campaign means a lot for how great the final game will be.
So please help spread the word and make Conquer Mars all it can be :)

 
 

A Giant Leap for Mankind
In the early 2000s, discord and random acts of war and terror stole the headlines of newspapers and the minds of politicians. The first response was war, surveillance and suspicion, but results were meagre and indecisive. After a few decades, a series of financial meltdowns and several minor wars, the governments of the world were ready for a previously unseen level of cooperation. The Earth Assembly was formed in 2032 and under a transnational leadership the countries of the world saw peace and prosperity.
The force of this cooperative effort was too large for one planet and the nations formed the Solar Consortium in 2037. The Solar Consortium coordinated the fledgling space mining industries of the individual nations into a large, effective mining consortium. It built infrastructure and ensured effective tech and knowledge sharing, creating a massive mining operation that spanned moons, asteroids and the planet of Mars. Rare metals and minerals soon flowed to earth.
The Solar Consortium grew and expanded mining operations across the solar system, but on earth the Earth Assembly slowly deteriorated and it finally fell apart in 2068. Turmoil and wars claimed the attention and resources of the Earth nations once again and without the support and leadership from the Earth Assembly, the Solar Consortium fell apart as well.
By 2068 half a million people were living in space, and they had no intention of returning to Earth. Their homes were the capital control ships, colonies, mining squads and beam transporters that were built for the mining effort and the distribution of resources. No nation on Earth had the resources to claim the space mining corporations for their own and as the supply of metals and minerals was largely uninterrupted, they saw no need.
7 years after Solar Consortium disintegrated, they are still there, mining. On Mars the competition for the best mines is fierce. Rival corporations and rogue mining gangs fight over the mining facilities using droids and AI-controlled war machines, claiming the resources mined and beaming them to the Capital Control ships that remain the neutral backbone of the space mining infrastructure. Welcome to 2075. Welcome to Mars.


  


Premium membership
The premium membership has three main benefits:


You earn game credits at 3x the speed of a free player, enabling you to unlock units and upgrades faster


You get to build a greater variety of units in the game


You can chat in public games


Alpha access
You get instant Alpha Access to play Conquer Mars when you support us!The game will be ready for hours of fun but the game will still have missing features. However, you will be able to provide valuable feedback to the developers to help shape the game.
Starts: Instant (We send a key to your email within 8 hours) Duration: 1-3 months.
Beta access
When Conquer Mars has all the essential features completed we will open up for beta access. The game will be more complete but you can still provide feedback and help shape the game in its final phase.
When the game nears completion we will slowly open up for all alpha/beta players to invite new players to the game until Conquer Mars is ready for everyone.
Starts: When the Alpha ends.Duration: 2-3 months.
Own the game / Instant unlocking of current and future units
You can unlock units either by paying with real money or in-game credits, but with instant unlocking you don’t have to spend anything on new units as they will be available to you as soon as we make them.
Everything that affects the gameplay will be immediately available to you - always. This is why it's called ""own the game"" :)
This doesn’t mean your hard earned in-game credits are useless though. We plan to make different visual upgrades and other things that don’t affect the gameplay which you can then spend your in-game credits on.
Special badges
All players will have a badge associated with them, both in the lobby and in the game. We will probably even display them in 3D on the mines you control in the game. The special badges that you get here can only be obtained from this Indiegogo campaign.




 
Wages
Conquer Mars is designed and programmed by two people (Jonas and Thomas), and we really want to dedicate all our time to releasing the best possible game.
Freelancers
Most of the art is created by talented freelancers. This includes the 3D models, sound, music, and concept art.
Servers
Conquer Mars is an online multiplayer game at heart, so there always has to be servers available for you to play on. Making sure the servers can run 24x7 is what the premium membership helps pay for.
Dreaming big
Our dreams for Conquer Mars aren’t limited to what you see in this campaign. We’re just trying to be realistic. With enough support we would love to expand the story in the universe and create a campaign. We also want to make a version of Conquer Mars for tablets which we intend to make free for backers - but we only want to promise the things we know we can deliver.
 

Everything in this list will be delivered if we reach the $100.000 goal.


Intelligent AI We have a basic AI in Conquer Mars that is quite fun for beginners. But we need a much smarter AI that can play at all levels, utilize all units intelligently, use missiles and avoid them, defend or attack on multiple fronts and so on.

Map editor All the maps in Conquer Mars are currently auto-generated. This gives a nice variation, but it will be great to have player designed maps to play on.

More units We already have models and textures ready for two new units: Attack buggy and The Pincer. With your support we hope to supply a steady stream of cool new units for you to play.

Replay and sharing You know that awesome game where you were a total underdog, but still beat 7 other players with cunning and manipulation in a huge final battle? We have prototype functionality ready so you can replay that game, but we want to make a polished replay system for sharing online and even embed on your own website or blog.

High scores, achievements, profiles, badges You need to be able to customize your profile, select a badge to represent your style, get achievements for destroying the armies of your enemies and claim your spot on the high score charts.

Friends list Add your friends, invite them to games or send them chat messages. When spectator mode is available you can also follow your friends and follow the games they play.

Ranking and matchmaking Unlike many other games, Conquer Mars can still be a lot of fun when playing against players better than you. But it’s still better to be matched against players at roughly your level, so we need a ranking and matchmaking system to make sure you get the most fun out of playing.  We also want to make a handicap system, so you can make games where players of different skill are automatically handicapped to give everyone a fair chance.

Gameplay features The gameplay in Conquer Mars works really well but there is still more to do. For example, we want you to be able to influence your fellow players by telling them to focus on a player who is starting to dominate. You may also have an idea for a great and necessary feature that we just have to get in the game before it’s released. Let us know!

Balance and polishMaking Conquer Mars is a huge project just to make the basic 3D, multiplayer and gameplay. But it’s not worth much if the gameplay is unbalanced or there are too many bugs. We’re good at making bugfree and polished software, but it’s still a very time consuming process.

 
  
If you think Conquer Mars looks promising then please follow us on Twitter or like us on Facebook.
To motivate you a bit we are promising two cool features that we will implement if we reach our goals.
1000 followers on Twitter: Spectator mode
Spectator mode is where others can watch games live without themselves playing it. This is great for making your small tournaments among friends, or simply watching how the best players play and follow them live.
1000 likes on Facebook: Team Play
The only play mode in Conquer Mars right now is free for all, where you compete against all the other players at once. With team play modes you can make 3v3, 2v2v2v2 games or any other combination that you want.

$125.000: Offline play
Although Conquer Mars is an online multiplayer game at heart, it is still a lot of fun to play against just the AI. We will create an installable version of Conquer Mars where you can play against the AI when you are disconnected from the internet.
$150.000: Tournaments
Conquer Mars is perfect for making tournaments where spectators can watch the games live as they unfold. We will build the tools to host tournaments and we will also make it possible for you to arrange your own private tournaments in Conquer Mars.
We also want to make it possible for you to embed Conquer Mars on your own website, if you want to build a special community or host a tournament. As long as people are playing Conquer Mars and nobody is trying something sleazy, we’re open to anything.
Possible future stretch goals
16+ player modes
Multiview desktop version
Tablet version
Level editor + Custom models for units

Several extremely talented freelancers helped bring Conquer Mars to where it is today.
3D models and textures
Daniel McCarthy: http://www.danielmccarthycgartist.com/
Daniel has been working on Conquer Mars from the start, creating all the awesome models and textures you experience in the game. Not surprisingly, The Creative Assembly recently hired Daniel to work full time on the Total War series.
This also means we need someone to help us create the next wave of Conquer Mars units. If you (or someone you know) can make great low-poly 3D models and texture them to fit with the current quality and style, then please send us an email at contact@conquermars.com
Sound effects
Tapio Liukkonen: http://www.kaamossound.com/
Tapio is an award winning sound designer who has worked on games like Amnesia, Overgrowth, and Xenonauts. He creates many of his sounds from real sources deep in the Finnish woods to build an immersive and powerful soundscape for the battles on Mars.
Music
Mikko Tarmia: http://www.mikkotarmia.com/
Mikko is an award winning composer who has made music for games like Amnesia, Overgrowth, and Penumbra. Mixing the classical with the electronic, Mikko makes great music that really sets the mood for Conquer Mars.
For Conquer Mars, Mikko has helped create a dynamic music system where the game engine fades layers of music in and out to fit the level of action you are experiencing.
Story and universe creation
Lars Vilhelmsen: http://larsvilhelmsen.dk/
Lars is a talented writer with a passion for games. Lars is working with us to create a believable and fascinating universe for Conquer Mars, which goes far beyond the current Martian dirtside action.

Game engine
To power Conquer Mars we have built our own game engine in ActionScript 3 for Flash and Stage3D. The engine is specifically built to handle thousands of units in a 3D multiplayer setting.
Handling lots of units means that many things have to be simpler, but we prefer to have very large armies of simple units rather than small detailed armies.
Runs in your browser
Conquer Mars is a Flash-based browser game, and it's optimized to be as small as possible. The entire game with models, textures, and sounds is under 7MB! The music streams in after the game has loaded.
The small size means that the game loads in seconds the first time, and your browser caches the game and then loads instantly the next time you want to play.
Multiplayer tech
Conquer Mars is powered by Player.IO, a multiplayer game service recently acquired by Yahoo! We have worked with Chris and Oliver, the founders of Player.IO, to make the multiplayer in Conquer Mars close to flawless.

Platforms: Windows + Mac + (Maybe?) Linux

Conquer Mars is made in Flash, and is fully supported on all PC & Mac computers that support the latest Flash with Stage3D.
This means all versions of Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Opera - as long as you have the latest Flash.
You can go to www.conquermars.com - If the website loads without any warnings you should be good to go.
Linux support: We don’t have a Linux box available with 3D graphics to test this ourselves. If you have Chrome running on Linux with 3D support and you want to help please send us an email at contact@conquermars.com.
Update: Looks like it does work on Linux! http://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/the-funding-crowd-12-july-23th-30th.2213/page=2

<p>The digital movement controls offered by keyboards have never been a match for the <b>analog control of a gamepad’s left stick</b>, but pro gamers have traditionally preferred the aiming accuracy of a mouse.</p>

</div></div>","INTRODUCING THE NACON ALPHA PADA New Way to Win in PC eSportsProfessional video gaming has experienced an astronomical rise in popularity over the last five years. However many PC eSports enthusiasts, particularly those with console gaming backgrounds, are discouraged from entering competitions due to the lack of a gamepad that can challenge the success of keyboard and mouse control.Having already developed a reputation for producing innovative PC gaming accessories, NACON’s latest pioneering product is set to change that.  Weitere Infos zum Projekt in deutscher Sprache finden Sie hier:http://nacongaming.com/de/gc400es-project/  N'hésitez pas à découvrir le projet en français en vous rendant sur: http://nacongaming.com/fr/gc400es-project/Non esitate a scoprire il progetto in italiano al seguente link:http://nacongaming.com/it/gc400es-project/      No dudes en revisar el proyecto en tu propio idioma en : http://nacongaming.com/es/gc400es-project/     The Alpha Pad is a PC controller capable of elite-level performance across all gaming genres. The world’s first eSports-ready gamepad, it offers the ergonomic and intuitive movement control benefits of a controller and the precision and customisability of a mouse and keyboard.Developed with the help of world champion pro-gamer Norman “GEN1US” Chatrier and the French eSports Academy, the Alpha Pad has been put through its paces by top professional players. With its unique abilities and affordable price point, it offers PC gamers a whole new way to take part in eSports.  
 

Before we can get the Alpha Pad into the hands of professional PC gamers and aspiring eSports competitors, we need your support to make it a reality. In exchange for helping us reach our campaign target of $30,000 USD, we’re offering a variety of perks, including the chance to own a limited-edition Alpha Pad and to receive money off the purchase price.
So if you’re one of the army of PC gamers out there looking for an easier way to get into eSports, we invite you to join the huge community already supporting the Alpha Pad’s creation. By backing this campaign, you’ll be helping us create a product that will alter the landscape of professional PC gaming. Thank you! 

 
 

 
The Alpha Pad has been created to offer the comfort, analog movement and portability of a gamepad, the precision of a mouse and the customisability of a keyboard.

The Alpha Pad’s ergonomic design and intuitive control layout have been painstakingly crafted to provide the optimum user experience, even over extensive and challenging periods of use.
The use of special materials ensures maximum grip while a series of removable weights in its handgrips ensure the pad sits comfortably in any hand.
 
 
 
  

The digital movement controls offered by keyboards have never been a match for the analog control of a gamepad’s left stick, but pro gamers have traditionally preferred the aiming accuracy of a mouse.
Boasting an amplitude of 46 degrees, compared to the 38 degrees offered by most controllers, the Alpha Pad’s ultra-sensitive right stick offers the pinpoint precision of a gaming mouse.
 
Meanwhile, larger action buttons ensure complete control and a specially-designed, thumb-friendly directional pad is perfect for nailing complex combo chains.
 
 

 


Compatible with all PC games, the Alpha Pad offers two modes aimed at different playing abilities. Its upgradeable onboard memory, which can hold up to four separate profiles, will ensure it stays at the cutting edge as PC gaming evolves.
 
Designed for intermediate gamers, Classic Mode offers up direct and X input modes. Engaging Pro-Gamer Mode, offers up to four preset profiles tailor-made for specific genres and games meanwhile, elevates the Alpha Pad’s performance potential to the elite level, allowing it to excel in every genre, from first-person shooters like Counter-Strike to multiplayer online battle arena titles like League of Legends and real-time strategy games like StarCraft. Aimed at professional players, this mode allows users to customise profiles to produce  a truly personalised setup. 
Featuring four extra buttons, the fully-programmable Alpha Pad can easily adapt to all preferences. It can even directly emulate a keyboard (buttons and left stick) and mouse (right stick and shoulder buttons).
 

 
The Alpha Pad’s onboard memory contains up to four profiles with a software installation required to modify the settings.  Once your controller is configured, thanks to the dedicated software you can bring it with you, meaning you can travel, plug, play and keep on winning.
Wired for extra accuracy, the Alpha Pad’s durable braided cable features a robust metal connector that can be quickly detached for transportation.
Easy to fit into its included travel pouch, the Alpha Pad beats a bulky keyboard and mouse combination when on the move.

The notion of a high-end controller aimed at the keyboard-and-mouse-dominated PC eSports market isn’t a new one. Gamers and eSports enthusiasts – especially those with console gaming backgrounds – have been calling for a new way to take part in professional PC gaming for many years.
After fielding a huge number of requests from frustrated gamers amongst the vibrant community that had grown around its groundbreaking PC gaming products, NACON decided to take on the challenge.

Its right stick would have to mirror the manoeuvrability of a gaming mouse and its button layout would have to offer the flexibility of a keyboard.

 
 

After developing a series of early prototypes, NACON entered discussions with the French eSports Academy and enlisted the help of respected pro-gamer, GEN1US. The early tests were promising and what was to become known as the “Alpha Pad” began to generate a great deal of interest amongst gamers. 

 

 

 
 
 


 
The final prototypes were produced in January 2016 and, with your support, we will be able to begin production in anticipation of shipping the Alpha Pad towards the end of the year.

<p><strong><em>Welcome! We're updating with news about the project (and the hackings) just below here, but the basics of what GAB is and what we're doing are further below.  Scroll a bit to ""GAB in Short"" to read that first.</em></strong></p>
<h3>Update #4</h3>
<p>Hey folks! Thanks for all the support! If you're curious to read about what happened with the site, the <a href=""http://www.ingame.msnbc.msn.com/technology/ingame/anti-bigotry-gaming-site-hacked-defaced-bigots-910262"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">piece by Winda at NBC News</a> does a fantastic job of summing it up.<br/><br/>We've got a big team of folks working together to get the site relaunched stronger than ever, and very soon.  I'm also working on filing preliminary paperwork necessary for the 501(c)3 non-profit incorporation.</p>
<p>It's been so wonderful seeing how passionately people are getting behind us.  We're really going to be able to hit the ground running!</p>
<h3>Update #3</h3>
<p>What a crazy 24 hours.  After the GAB site with all the pledges got wiped Sunday night, all of my other sites, personal and professional, got knocked out one-by-one.  Most everything is back online, and the support on <a href=""http://twitter.com/gab648"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a>, <a href=""http://facebook.com/GAB648"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a>, and -- most of all -- here has been amazing!<br/><br/>I wanted to make a few clarifications now that we've broken the funding goal, because a few media agencies are incorrectly reporting on this whole IndieGoGo thing. </p>
<ol>
<li>This project was not originally a response to the hacker attacks.  In fact, it was launched at the same time as GAB, with the main goal of incorporating as a 501(c)3 non-profit<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>The goal of the project has changed, but, unfortunately, I'm not able to change the key details on IndieGoGo (e.g., funding goal) to reflect that.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>While it's fantastic that the hackers have raised awareness about GAB, the unfortunate side is that now all of the money we've raised so far ($1200), as well as a great deal more, will have to go into improving the security for the site.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Update #2</h3>
<p>At 11pm CT Sunday, July 22, <strong>as the pledge score was nearing 1500 pledges</strong>, <a href=""http://gamersagainstbigotry.org/signatures"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the site</a> was taken down by hackers, causing us to lose all of the pledges.  As we try to assess the situation and rebuild, this campaign will be incredibly important in fighting back.  A few people were so threatened by the idea of ending bigotry, that they went out of their way to wage a week-long series of attacks on the site, culminating in this last blow.  </p>
<p><span>As a fan on Facebook said, “<strong>they need the IndieGoGo – they’re going to need the level of security you normally find at research corporations just to stay afloat with the savage attacks they’re going to receive.</strong>”</span></p>
<p><span>(Psst... If you're a developer who thinks you can help, please contact me using one of the links at the bottom of this page)</span></p>
<p><span><img alt=""GAB got Hacked"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://gamersagainstbigotry.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/GAB-HACKED.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></span></p>
<h3>Update #1</h3>
<p>Check out <a href=""http://www.themarysue.com/gamers-against-bigotry/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""The Mary Sue"">this great interview at The Mary Sue</a> and <a href=""http://mashable.com/2012/07/14/gamers-against-bigotry/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Mashable Gamers Against Bigotry"">Mashable</a> with GAB founder Sam Killermann!  It provides a deeper insight into the organization and its goals.</p>
<h2>GAB in short</h2>
<p>Gamers Against Bigotry <span>was created with one purpose in mind: to create a more welcoming gaming community for all gamers, regardless of their identity.  Gaming is awesome.  And online multiplayer gaming is more awesome.  But it sucks that gamers have to choose to not play online, or to deal with a relentless barrage of identity-based hate slung their way if they do log in.</span></p>
<p>If you don't think this is a problem, watch <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SLDgPbjp0M"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Cross Assault"">this video</a>, <a href=""http://penny-arcade.com/patv/episode/harassment"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Penny Arcade"">this video</a>, or check out <a href=""http://fatuglyorslutty.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Fat Ugly or Slutty"">this site</a>, then get back to us.</p>
<p>At the end of June, we created a <a href=""http://gamersagainstbigotry.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Gamers Against Bigotry"">pledge and a website</a> where gamers could go to make a stand.  With no advertising but the word of mouth, in the first week over 600 gamers from all around the world signed the pledge and showed their support.  We've managed to do all of that in a week, with absolutely no funding.  Imagine what we can do if we get the community behind us.</p>
<p>Here is the pledge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a gamer, I realize I contribute to an incredibly diverse social network of gamers around the world, and that my actions have the ability to impact others. In effort to make a positive impact, and to create a community that is welcoming to all, I pledge to not use bigoted language while gaming, online and otherwise.</p>
<p>Bigoted language includes, but is not limited to, slurs based on race, ethnicity, gender,sexual orientation, and disability.</p>
<p><em>Read more about the pledge, and what is and isn't included, <a href=""http://gamersagainstbigotry.org/pledge/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""About the pledge"">here</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>Read why you shouldn't use the word ""rape"" casually <a href=""http://gamersagainstbigotry.org/2012/07/why-you-should-stop-saying-rape-casually-in-games/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Stop saying Rape in Gaming"">here</a>.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need Funded</h3>
<p><em><strong>Update: Given the recent level of attacks on the site, our needs have changed.  I've annotated the new needs in italics below.</strong></em></p>
<p>So far, everything we have accomplished has been without funding.  The development of the website, the artwork, and the engineering of the pledge have all been donated.  In order to grow, we'll need the following:</p>
<p><strong>Incorporate as  Non-Profit: </strong>we want to officially incorporate and apply to be a 501(c)3 non-profit, but it's (ironically) incredibly expensive to start a non-profit.  Help us with the $300 - $500 legal fees!  <em>Still priority number one</em></p>
<p><strong>Advertising:</strong> word of mouth has done us well so far, but advertising on Facebook and gaming forums will allow us to greatly expand our reach, and advertising isn't cheap.  <em>No longer as much an issue -- after funding the non-profit, money will go first into the next two things</em></p>
<p><strong>PHP/MySQL Developer: </strong>the site is vulnerable to attacks right now (and has actually been brought down by a couple of troll hackers a few times already), so we need the help of a professional PHP/MySQL developer to enhance security of the pledge and protect against exploits.  <em>Getting a security specialist or two on board is a must</em></p>
<p><strong>Dedicated Server Hosting</strong><strong>: </strong>right now the server space is shared with several other projects on a group hosting plan, but as the site grows and starts getting more traffic, we'll have to up our hosting.  The cost difference will be going from the current $8/mo to $70 - 100/mo.  <em>Better hosting will help better secure the site</em></p>
<p><strong>AS WE BREAK $700: </strong>there are a lot of things we'd like to get started on right now, but the success of this project will be pivotal in accomplishing them.  Beyond what's listed above, as we break $700 and go upward the following tasks will become possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><em>Secure the Site!</em></strong><strong><br/></strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>CONs/PAX! </strong>We would love to have a presence at PAX to be able to interact, in-person, with gamers and help grow the movement.</li>
<li>
<strong>GAB Mobile Ap! </strong>Think Xfire, but with the ability to connect with other gamers who want to play online in a welcoming environment</li>
<li>
<strong>Informative and entertaining video series</strong> highlighting different aspects of bigotry in gaming and ways we can end them (professional comedian actors, and film crew)</li>
<li>
<strong>Merch!</strong> Right now, we have a <a href=""http://www.cafepress.com/gamersagainstbigotry"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Cafe Press"">cafe press store</a> but the prices are terrible and the overhead is ridiculous.  We'd like to be able to order and print our own series of merch to get it to the fans at a lower price.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3 class=""_mce_tagged_br"">What You Get in Return</h3>
<p>Other than the swag mentioned for each perk, you get to know that you did something about a problem with the gaming community that most others have ignored and swept under the rug.  That's pretty awesome, isn't it?  It is.</p>
<h3>What's Our Plan for the Pledge?</h3>
<h3 class=""_mce_tagged_br""><img alt=""GAB Action Plan"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://gamersagainstbigotry.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Gamers-Against-Bigotry-Future-Steps-Graphics.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""GAB Action Plan""/></h3>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Sign the pledge at <a href=""http://gamersagainstbigotry.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://gamersagainstbigotry.org</a>! Spread the link around to your friends and encourage they sign the pledge.  Tell your friends about this project and suggest they donate a few dollars.  And you can always follow us on <a href=""http://facebook.com/GAB648"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> and <a href=""http://twitter.com/GAB648"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Twitter"">Twitter</a> to stay tuned for future developments.</p>

What a crazy 24 hours.  After the GAB site with all the pledges got wiped Sunday night, all of my other sites, personal and professional, got knocked out one-by-one.  Most everything is back online, and the support on Twitter, Facebook, and -- most of all -- here has been amazing!I wanted to make a few clarifications now that we've broken the funding goal, because a few media agencies are incorrectly reporting on this whole IndieGoGo thing. 

This project was not originally a response to the hacker attacks.  In fact, it was launched at the same time as GAB, with the main goal of incorporating as a 501(c)3 non-profit

The goal of the project has changed, but, unfortunately, I'm not able to change the key details on IndieGoGo (e.g., funding goal) to reflect that.

While it's fantastic that the hackers have raised awareness about GAB, the unfortunate side is that now all of the money we've raised so far ($1200), as well as a great deal more, will have to go into improving the security for the site.

Update #2
At 11pm CT Sunday, July 22, as the pledge score was nearing 1500 pledges, the site was taken down by hackers, causing us to lose all of the pledges.  As we try to assess the situation and rebuild, this campaign will be incredibly important in fighting back.  A few people were so threatened by the idea of ending bigotry, that they went out of their way to wage a week-long series of attacks on the site, culminating in this last blow.  
As a fan on Facebook said, “they need the IndieGoGo – they’re going to need the level of security you normally find at research corporations just to stay afloat with the savage attacks they’re going to receive.”
(Psst... If you're a developer who thinks you can help, please contact me using one of the links at the bottom of this page)

Update #1
Check out this great interview at The Mary Sue and Mashable with GAB founder Sam Killermann!  It provides a deeper insight into the organization and its goals.
GAB in short
Gamers Against Bigotry was created with one purpose in mind: to create a more welcoming gaming community for all gamers, regardless of their identity.  Gaming is awesome.  And online multiplayer gaming is more awesome.  But it sucks that gamers have to choose to not play online, or to deal with a relentless barrage of identity-based hate slung their way if they do log in.
If you don't think this is a problem, watch this video, this video, or check out this site, then get back to us.
At the end of June, we created a pledge and a website where gamers could go to make a stand.  With no advertising but the word of mouth, in the first week over 600 gamers from all around the world signed the pledge and showed their support.  We've managed to do all of that in a week, with absolutely no funding.  Imagine what we can do if we get the community behind us.
Here is the pledge:

As a gamer, I realize I contribute to an incredibly diverse social network of gamers around the world, and that my actions have the ability to impact others. In effort to make a positive impact, and to create a community that is welcoming to all, I pledge to not use bigoted language while gaming, online and otherwise.
Bigoted language includes, but is not limited to, slurs based on race, ethnicity, gender,sexual orientation, and disability.
Read more about the pledge, and what is and isn't included, here.

What We Need Funded
Update: Given the recent level of attacks on the site, our needs have changed.  I've annotated the new needs in italics below.
So far, everything we have accomplished has been without funding.  The development of the website, the artwork, and the engineering of the pledge have all been donated.  In order to grow, we'll need the following:
Incorporate as  Non-Profit: we want to officially incorporate and apply to be a 501(c)3 non-profit, but it's (ironically) incredibly expensive to start a non-profit.  Help us with the $300 - $500 legal fees!  Still priority number one
Advertising: word of mouth has done us well so far, but advertising on Facebook and gaming forums will allow us to greatly expand our reach, and advertising isn't cheap.  No longer as much an issue -- after funding the non-profit, money will go first into the next two things
PHP/MySQL Developer: the site is vulnerable to attacks right now (and has actually been brought down by a couple of troll hackers a few times already), so we need the help of a professional PHP/MySQL developer to enhance security of the pledge and protect against exploits.  Getting a security specialist or two on board is a must
Dedicated Server Hosting: right now the server space is shared with several other projects on a group hosting plan, but as the site grows and starts getting more traffic, we'll have to up our hosting.  The cost difference will be going from the current $8/mo to $70 - 100/mo.  Better hosting will help better secure the site
AS WE BREAK $700: there are a lot of things we'd like to get started on right now, but the success of this project will be pivotal in accomplishing them.  Beyond what's listed above, as we break $700 and go upward the following tasks will become possible:


Secure the Site!


CONs/PAX! We would love to have a presence at PAX to be able to interact, in-person, with gamers and help grow the movement.

GAB Mobile Ap! Think Xfire, but with the ability to connect with other gamers who want to play online in a welcoming environment

Informative and entertaining video series highlighting different aspects of bigotry in gaming and ways we can end them (professional comedian actors, and film crew)

Merch! Right now, we have a cafe press store but the prices are terrible and the overhead is ridiculous.  We'd like to be able to order and print our own series of merch to get it to the fans at a lower price.



What You Get in Return
Other than the swag mentioned for each perk, you get to know that you did something about a problem with the gaming community that most others have ignored and swept under the rug.  That's pretty awesome, isn't it?  It is.
What's Our Plan for the Pledge?

Luminesca is an action/exploration PC game set in an underwater world. I am developing the game for the PC (with a little support from some friends) with hopes to bring it to more platforms if it's successful.
In Luminesca you control a little creature called Lum.

Outsmart predators, guide small creatures and scare off rivals using your esca (that's the glowing bit on your head!)
Explore an underwater world, full of life, which responds to your touch and physical presence.
Discover the secrets that lie in the deep...

Luminesca is a 2D side-scrolling adventure which focuses on the events of a changing environment, utilising light and physics to challenge the part of you that loves to explore.

Story
Springing to life in the protozoan soup, Lum is thrust into a confusing world of dazzling lights and frightening monsters. His colony's habitat comes under threat when a vast, ancient machine grinds into motion and starts to consume all the surrounding water. Lum's adventure takes him from all corners of his environment to the heart of the machine, encountering a rich ecology of inhabitants and learning some valuable lessons about the world around him.



What do I get if I donate?

Donating $5 or more gets you same-day access to regular 'work-in-progress' versions of the game.
Donating $10 acts as a pre-order of the finished game when it's released.
There are bigger rewards for higher donations (such as art prints and the soundtrack) which you can see in the perks box on the right-hand side of the page.





What does Luminesca need money for?
I want to make Luminesca as good as it can be, and this means working on it full-time. The funding would help with living costs during the project and allow me to commit my full time and attention to making the game live up to its maximum potential.
It would also help to pay for promotional efforts such as software licenses and web hosting which are a requirement if I want to bring Luminesca to a wider audience.



What if the community's donation exceeds my goal?
The amount I have asked for is the minimum I would need to make the game. If the community kindly donates more than this amount I can go to extra lengths to improve Luminesca and distribute it on more platforms.


Extra funding could contribute towards a Unity Pro license would allow me to improve the visuals of the game and use more powerful tools to create it.

And finally, perhaps most importantly, extra funding would allow me to consider hiring other people to provide higher quality art and programming support.



I do not expect you to donate more than you need to, but it would certainly go a long way if you did!

</a><p>MAGE, or Mobile Application Generation Environment, is an easy-to-use 
product that allows anyone to create a mobile application without any 
programming simply by loading MAGE in their browser. MAGE is perfect for
 experienced application creators and beginners alike. Load the creation
 panel; select a template or work from scratch; load your website or 
drag and drop content and images; select features and build.</p>
<p>MAGE allows anyone to create gorgeous mobile applications without sacrificing functionality.</p>

<p>The mobile creation environment allows anyone to quickly and easily 
create a gorgeous mobile application with superior functionality. MAGE 
allows a user to drag and drop content and images as well as incorporate
 lists, tables, and menus. MAGE also allows an application creator to 
integrate dynamic content, analytics, and push notifications into their 
applications by using an online control panel for each created 
application.</p>

<div>
<p><b>The Goal</b></p>
<p>The end goal of MAGE is to create an 
environment that brings all mobile application creation options and 
outside features under one roof. There are many amazing extra features 
to complement mobile applications that developers do not add because of 
the time it takes to add them. MAGE makes this extremely simple, but 
don’t forget that MAGE’s primary goal is to enable mobile application 
creation to the highest extent.</p>

</a><p><b>How It Works</b></p>
<p>If you have a website, not a problem if you don't, the first option will
 be to enter in your address. MAGE can then pull content (such as images
 and text) from your website and generate a starter application for you 
to modify. The application creation panel then allows an application 
creator numerous options to add text, images, buttons, menus, dynamic 
content modules, and dozens of other features. Choose from our 
pre-designed templates to build off of, load your website, or build an 
application from scratch. The choice is yours.</p>

conceived out of the idea of an easier way to create mobile applications
 without having to pay high prices or sacrificing functionality. Among 
us, we have a rather extensive background in designing, building, and 
publishing mobile applications, and it has brought us joy to see our 
users discover what we have built and use it. We wish to bring that same

</a><p>The idea for MAGE originally stemmed
 from the questions of how to get more individuals and businesses 
exciting about mobile applications and how they can use them to address 
their needs. Our first thought was to go to more events and trade shows 
and directly interact with potential customers there; however we didn't 
think that a few phones and slides would be all that interesting. Our 
next idea was to allow individuals to create a mobile application right 
there on the spot using a laptop or tablet. From this idea, MAGE was

…And That’s Why We Created MAGE





MAGE, or Mobile Application Generation Environment, is an easy-to-use 
product that allows anyone to create a mobile application without any 
programming simply by loading MAGE in their browser. MAGE is perfect for
 experienced application creators and beginners alike. Load the creation
 panel; select a template or work from scratch; load your website or 
drag and drop content and images; select features and build.
MAGE allows anyone to create gorgeous mobile applications without sacrificing functionality.





The mobile creation environment allows anyone to quickly and easily 
create a gorgeous mobile application with superior functionality. MAGE 
allows a user to drag and drop content and images as well as incorporate
 lists, tables, and menus. MAGE also allows an application creator to 
integrate dynamic content, analytics, and push notifications into their 
applications by using an online control panel for each created 
application.


Create Unlimited Apps
There is no limit to the number of apps that you can create using MAGE.



The Goal
The end goal of MAGE is to create an 
environment that brings all mobile application creation options and 
outside features under one roof. There are many amazing extra features 
to complement mobile applications that developers do not add because of 
the time it takes to add them. MAGE makes this extremely simple, but 
don’t forget that MAGE’s primary goal is to enable mobile application 
creation to the highest extent.





The funds provided by you, our backers, will be used to fund the 
development of MAGE and to pay for the servers to run it after it is 
completed.


How It Works
If you have a website, not a problem if you don't, the first option will
 be to enter in your address. MAGE can then pull content (such as images
 and text) from your website and generate a starter application for you 
to modify. The application creation panel then allows an application 
creator numerous options to add text, images, buttons, menus, dynamic 
content modules, and dozens of other features. Choose from our 
pre-designed templates to build off of, load your website, or build an 
application from scratch. The choice is yours.







Templates
MAGE users will have the option of choosing 
from a set of templates to help them get started creating their mobile 
application. These templates will be for businesses and individuals 
alike.
Creating Games with MAGE



A lot of feedback we have gotten is for the ability to create games 
with MAGE. We are happy to respond to these requests with a very 
positive YES! You will be able to create games with MAGE. Using our 
games pack and provided templates you will be able to create games. 
These games will be limited to the templates we provide, but our goal is
 to continually be providing new templates for our users as MAGE 
continues to develop and evolve.


Mobile Control Panel
Each
 application built using MAGE also gets a mobile control panel that is 
generated by MAGE. Application creators can access the control panel and
 use it to change content on the application, push out updates, send 
push notifications, and monitor analytics.
Dynamic Content





Our dynamic content option allows for an application creator to set a
 specific area on an application for dynamic content and then set this 
content through the mobile control panel. This content can be changed at
 any time from the control panel, and it is instantly reflected across 
all installed applications.
Analytics




MAGE has two levels of analytics: basic and advanced. Basic analytics
 keep track of page views and installs of your applications. Advanced 
analytics break this data down into much more detailed information, such
 as time period of views, location of installs, and other useful 
information.


Push Notifications



MAGE offers push notifications for all applications. The mobile 
control panel has a scheduling and grouping plug-in built in that allows
 administrators to schedule when notifications are to be sent as well as
 whom to send notifications to.


Publishing Your App
Many
 app creators don't realize the extra work and effort required to submit
 their app to their chosen platform's app store. MAGE takes care of this
 as well for application creators. We will build your application 
binary, certify it, and submit it for review. The Google Play Store 
publishes application within several hours, Apple's App Store usually 
takes some time due to their extensive review process, and Windows Phone

<p>Help make Mouffe ready-to-travel with the necessary equipment!</p>
</div>
<p>Mouffe is a
very unique kind of experience, and can be enjoyed by a very wide
range of audiences -- from families to festivals, from gamers to galleries. We
would very much like to bring Mouffe to more events; however this is difficult
due to the physical needs of the project.</p>
<p><i>It is very important to us that
Mouffe becomes a stand-alone, hassle-free package</i>. With all the components in one place, Mouffe would be simple for any event coordinators to set up, even without any of our team members present. Owning equipment, like our own
projector, would mean that we wouldn't need to rely on our show venues to
provide it for us. We would be able to test and continue tweaking and improving
the game, in-house. Assistance on travel funds makes it easier for us to get it
to events it’s accepted to, no matter the location – it could be your city! We
would even be able to host the creation of more games for the tent and blanket
controller by other developers.</p>
<p>A
one-package Mouffe is an accessible Mouffe, and we want to bring it to you!</p><p><br/></p><p><b>Update:</b> We've reached 100%!!

<p>Mouffe is a
daydream simulator: while lying down inside a tent and using a quilt as a
controller, players set off abstract animations projected onto the ceiling of
the tent. It is an interactive art installation that is part-game and part-toy.
Lie down and experience visual, aural, and tactile satisfaction in a quiet,
intimate space. Press buttons, things happen. Relax and Play.</p>
<p>Mouffe pushes
at the borders of the games as a medium – it’s not downloadable and it's irreproducible; there’s no way to “win”, and no achievements to unlock. All
that being said, Mouffe is really FUN TO PLAY, and despite it being a
non-commercial piece, with your help we can get it into gamers’ (and everyone’s!)
hands.</p><p>Mouffe has been shown at the Google offices in Montreal, and in Austin, Texas. It was an official selection of IndieCade 2014 in Los Angeles and Gamercamp in Toronto. </p><p>Upcoming appearances:</p><p></p><h4>Salon Ludique: Dreams</h4><p><i>Montreal, QC - 7pm, February 5th<br/>Espace Fibre, 2665 rue Augustin-Cantin, 2nd Floor<br/>$5 donation at door (goes directly to artists)</i><br/><a href=""http://www.salonludique.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.salonludique.org</a></p><h4>Vector Festival 2015</h4><p><i>Toronto, ON - Ongoing, February 18th to March 21st<br/>InterAccess Gallery, 9 Ossington Ave<br/>Free to attend</i><br/><a href=""http://www.vectorfestival.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.vectorfestival.org</a><br/><a href=""http://www.vectorfestival.org/exhibition-to-utility-and-beyond-interface-experiments-in-new-media-and-game-art/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">EXHIBITION OPENING RECEPTION: February 18th, 7pm to 9pm</a><br/><a href=""http://www.vectorfestival.org/panel-discussion-interface-experiments-in-new-media-and-game-art/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PANEL DISCUSSION: February 20th, 7pm to 9pm</a></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1156266/files/20150117214258-mouffegif1.gif?1421559778"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><h3></h3><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1159228/files/20150119080356-weneedyourhelp.png?1421683436"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The purpose
of this fundraising campaign is to:</p>
<p>●<span>  primarily, </span>purchase the necessary equipment that

container;</p>
<p>●<span>  </span>offset any
travel or shipping costs that Mouffe incurs in order to tour the project
to different places.</p><p>It is a very
simple breakdown: we buy the equipment first, and funds we receive in excess
will go towards reimbursing transportation costs made in service to Mouffe. We
are not asking for much, but we are very grateful because every penny counts
towards getting Mouffe closer to you!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1159268/files/20150119081716-PieChart.png?1421684236"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div>

<p>There is
actually very little risk involved in this donation campaign. With Indiegogo’s
flexibility, no matter what you decide to put in, that amount will go directly
to the project.</p>
<p>Mouffe was
never a commercial creation and we don’t ever want to charge for its
exhibition, so crowdfunding is the only way to cover future costs of the project. On the flip side, this also means that we will be asking
for this donation only once, and any investment that we receive from you will

Mouffe is a
very unique kind of experience, and can be enjoyed by a very wide
range of audiences -- from families to festivals, from gamers to galleries. We
would very much like to bring Mouffe to more events; however this is difficult
due to the physical needs of the project.
It is very important to us that
Mouffe becomes a stand-alone, hassle-free package. With all the components in one place, Mouffe would be simple for any event coordinators to set up, even without any of our team members present. Owning equipment, like our own
projector, would mean that we wouldn't need to rely on our show venues to
provide it for us. We would be able to test and continue tweaking and improving
the game, in-house. Assistance on travel funds makes it easier for us to get it
to events it’s accepted to, no matter the location – it could be your city! We
would even be able to host the creation of more games for the tent and blanket
controller by other developers.
A
one-package Mouffe is an accessible Mouffe, and we want to bring it to you!Update: We've reached 100%!! Thank you so much to everyone who donated and help us get the word out. We can't tell you how much we appreciate it.Stretch Goals -- New Developers Making Games for MouffeOne of Mouffe Team's goals has always been to turn the Mouffe set-up into a platform that various artists and developers can make their own games for. We'd really love to have new experiences that we can bring along with us to events and festivals.Your donation will help us pay our collaborators, and further the exciting evolution of Mouffe.With every $1000 stretch goal we meet, we will announce a new artist! They will each make a game that will be shown inside Mouffe (played with a blanket!) that will also be available to download for any funders at the $25 perk level and higher.We're super happy to announce our first collaboration is with Montreal's Devine Lu Linvega. Check out our latest update for more information.






Mouffe is a
daydream simulator: while lying down inside a tent and using a quilt as a
controller, players set off abstract animations projected onto the ceiling of
the tent. It is an interactive art installation that is part-game and part-toy.
Lie down and experience visual, aural, and tactile satisfaction in a quiet,
intimate space. Press buttons, things happen. Relax and Play.
Mouffe pushes
at the borders of the games as a medium – it’s not downloadable and it's irreproducible; there’s no way to “win”, and no achievements to unlock. All
that being said, Mouffe is really FUN TO PLAY, and despite it being a
non-commercial piece, with your help we can get it into gamers’ (and everyone’s!)
hands.Mouffe has been shown at the Google offices in Montreal, and in Austin, Texas. It was an official selection of IndieCade 2014 in Los Angeles and Gamercamp in Toronto. Upcoming appearances:Salon Ludique: DreamsMontreal, QC - 7pm, February 5thEspace Fibre, 2665 rue Augustin-Cantin, 2nd Floor$5 donation at door (goes directly to artists)www.salonludique.orgVector Festival 2015Toronto, ON - Ongoing, February 18th to March 21stInterAccess Gallery, 9 Ossington AveFree to attendwww.vectorfestival.orgEXHIBITION OPENING RECEPTION: February 18th, 7pm to 9pmPANEL DISCUSSION: February 20th, 7pm to 9pm
The purpose
of this fundraising campaign is to:
●  primarily, purchase the necessary equipment that
Mouffe needs to run, such as a short-throw projector and a suitable
container;
●  offset any
travel or shipping costs that Mouffe incurs in order to tour the project
to different places.It is a very
simple breakdown: we buy the equipment first, and funds we receive in excess
will go towards reimbursing transportation costs made in service to Mouffe. We
are not asking for much, but we are very grateful because every penny counts
towards getting Mouffe closer to you!





Your donation, no matter how big or small, is really important to us and we want you to know how much you have contributed to helping Mouffe. With your help, it can be seen by as many people as possible and continue to grow.* Offensive pennant names may be subject to revision.Check back often for campaign updates on this page to see previews of all the different perk items!

There is
actually very little risk involved in this donation campaign. With Indiegogo’s
flexibility, no matter what you decide to put in, that amount will go directly
to the project.
Mouffe was
never a commercial creation and we don’t ever want to charge for its
exhibition, so crowdfunding is the only way to cover future costs of the project. On the flip side, this also means that we will be asking
for this donation only once, and any investment that we receive from you will
go far.
At the end
of this campaign, no matter what happens, we plan to have that complete
package, ready to show around the world!

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>Base10 Games is a small, but talented group of developers that joined together to make amazing video games! Currently based in Colorado, we are passionate about creating the rich and entertaining experiences that we have learned to love while growing up.  Our first project, 'My Lil' Viking' is a compact action/platformer game for iOS and Android. What we have planned will be perfect for mobile platforms, but we need some help getting there!</p>
<p>Although we have already started working on the game, raising $7000 will go a long way towards helping us cover the cost of licensing software, purchasing necessary hardware, and will also of course speed up production time. Without your help, 'My Lil' Viking' could take well over a year to get off the ground, and will probably force us to release a smaller, less feature-complete version of the game. Now we know supporting a cause is fun and all, but we don't want funding our project to be a one-way relationship. So in exchange for helping us out, we're offering all kinds of exclusive 'My Lil' Viking' perks ranging from awesome t-shirts to entire shields!  Your contributions will not only guarantee 'My Lil' Viking"" will makes its public debut, but it will also ensure that Base10 Games will continue to make quality video games for many to enjoy in the future. Thanks!</p>

<h2>Gameplay </h2>
<p>My Lil’ Viking is a sidescrolling platformer game where the player must try to earn points, combat waves of enemies, and keep from being defeated for as long as possible in order to obtain a high score.</p>
<p>We here at Base10 are very aware of the picture-to-word exchange rate, so instead of just writing how the game works, we're proud to present you with:</p>
<h2>The Basics of Viking School!</h2>
<h3> Step1: Enter The Stage</h3>
<p><img alt=""Basics of Viking School"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/892814/pictures/full/20130625141556-BoVS-1.jpg?1372194959"" src="""" style="""" title=""Step 1""/></p>
<p>Players begin by entering a stage. Stages are filled with traps to avoid and monsters to fight. As time passes, more traps and monsters will begin to appear, making survival more challenging.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Step2: Collect Treasure</h3>
<p><img alt=""Basics of Viking School"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/892816/pictures/full/20130625141644-BoVS-2.jpg?1372195008"" src="""" style="""" title=""Step 2""/></p>
<p>Obtaining “Thunder Coins” is the primary method of achieving points in My Lil’ Viking. Small coins will drop from defeated enemies, and large coins will appear randomly throughout the stage. Obtaining “Loot” and defeating enemies in quick succession will add multipliers to your score.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Step3: Survive!</h3>
<p><img alt=""Basics of Viking School"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/892817/pictures/full/20130625141716-BoVS-3.jpg?1372195039"" src="""" style="""" title=""Step 3""/></p>
<p>If the player is hit three times by an enemy or trap, the game will end. The longer the player survives, the higher the score. Defeating certain amounts of a specific enemy will allow you to learn a special ability from them. These abilities are permanent and will allow the player to survive much longer than playing without them. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Step 4: Receive A Grade</h3>
<p><img alt=""Basics of Viking School"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/892819/pictures/full/20130625141740-BoVS-4.jpg?1372195065"" src="""" style="""" title=""Step 4""/></p>
<p>After the game ends, the player’s overall score will be calculated into a final grade. Swapping out various abilities to suit personal playstyles is key to achieving a higher score.</p>

<p>From between the folds of the fabric of reality they came, enticed by the call of the mighty Dungeonforge. The Aedifects, demigods with the power of creation in their hands, came together with one purpose: to create the ultimate test of the zeal and bravery of mankind.

<h2><img alt=""Premise"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/24688081/Banners/banner1.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Premise""/></h2>
<p>Dungeonforge is a free to play RPG where the community drives the content. We provide a dungeon and quest creation system, a rich gameworld for community content to exist in, and insane, action RPG combat with some innovative twists thrown in for maximum freshness. Dungeonforge is built on two main premises, that great gameplay, first and foremost, makes great games and that community created content makes the gaming world go ’round.<br/><br/><br/>The game will be free to play for everyone and all gameplay content will be available for free at all times. It is important to us to allow all players to enjoy the unlimited fresh content created by our community without restriction. Also, items that affect gameplay are not directly sold to players at all. Cosmetic items such as skins for your character will be offered to those interested in personalizing the look of their character. Our most interesting mechanic, however, is the Epic Dungeon system. Any dungeon can be played as an Epic Dungeon when using an Epic Dungeon Pass. This automatically increases the difficulty setting of the dungeon. When the dungeon is completed, all participating players are rewarded with Epic Loot. Epic Loot is simply aesthetically unique loot that may have interesting (however precisely balanced) effects when used. These effects will tend to be of a visual nature (think, transforming a defeated enemy into a harmless bunny rather than a corpse. Stuff like that). Epic Loot will also come in collectible sets that grant a boost to the user when all pieces are worn. Loot may be freely traded with other players so you can seek out and trade for the set you're currently collecting. When a dungeon is played using an Epic Dungeon Pass, the creator of the dungeon receives a kick-back of in-game currency to be used on cosmetic items or, if enough is accrued, even cashed in for real-world money providing a tangible reward for creating the very best content. Also, if your map is highly rated we'll promote it within the game upping the chances players find and play it and increasing your opportunity for such rewards.</p>

<p>As the name of the game aptly demonstrates, the ""Dungeonforge,"" our toolset for creating dungeons and quests, is at the heart of what we hope to accomplish. What we’re delivering is a set of tools for easily creating content for others to enjoy. <br/><br/>Was there ever a time when playing a game you loved that your imagination just went wild thinking about what you might add to the game? You’re not alone. User-made creations are woven throughout the very fabric of gaming. Have you given any thought, even just for a moment, to what mark you might want to leave? What’s standing in your way? <br/><br/>With the map editor that is at the core of Dungeonforge, we give you all you need to create instantly playable content. You'll be able to create a dungeon by laying down prefabricated sections. Once you've laid out the rooms and corridors you can set down monsters, determine loot drops, set down treasure chests, even add NPCs that can act as quest givers, merchants, helpers, or whatever else your narrative requires. Quest creation and editing tools are included to create your own story. You can add dialog or even add full-motion cut-scenes to your dungeon quickly and easily. Once your dungeon is finished, we then take that content and put it center stage for all to enjoy. <br/><br/>New, user-created content is always available and accessible from within the game as part of a rich, interconnected gameworld with the very best content becoming an indelible part of the gameworld and its lore.</p>

<h2><img alt=""Combat"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/24688081/Banners/banner4.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Combat""/></h2>
<p>Central to our promise of delivering a game with great gameplay at its foundation is our innovative take on combat. Dungeonforge is presented as a top-down, aRPG in the legacy of Diablo, Baldur's Gate, and other classics. Where we depart from the well-worn philosophy that governs that genre, however, is in the way our combat system emphasizes player skill and strategy to a greater degree, and the stat sheet to a slightly lesser. Stats form an important part of defining how a character plays and the ability to customize and focus that around your play style is fundamental to our philosophy. However, your character's stats are never given final say in victory or defeat. We put that power where it belongs; in the player's hands. <br/><br/>Though the player perspective is borrowed from games like Diablo, the combat system finds inspiration in particular from two other, very different games: Dark Souls, and the Witcher 2. <br/><br/><br/>The Dungeonforge combat system emphasizes timing, positioning and knowing your foe. Here, avoiding taking damage is on equal ground to dishing it.<br/><br/>Attacks are handled via the mouse clicks and the ""qwer"" hotkeys that should be familiar to many players. Where combat becomes unique, however, is in the timing-based combo system. In short, every attack can be strung into a combo. Every combo has a particular timing that, when exactly accomplished, grants a massive boost in damage or effects on enemies. This is supported by a robust animation system to vividly and fluidly display the combos and give players ample visual cues as to how the timing of a combo should be executed just by watching your character perform the moves. This prevents battle from ever degrading into ""stand there and spam a button 'til monster dies"" territory. <br/>To defend oneself, a player has the ability to dodge incoming attacks or take them on a shield. Here, positioning and timing are paramount to avoid taking an ax to the face. These defensive maneuvers blend seamlessly with offensive attacks, opening up enemies for devastating counter attacks. </p>
<p><br/>Our desire and intention with the combat system has been clear to us from the outset: to design something that is unique without being unfocused or cumbersome, plays fluidly, is fun to use, and emphasizes player skill first and foremost. Whatever we did, the end result would have to be something that was worth coming back to play over and over again. Something that supported our underlying premise that great games are built upon the foundation of great gameplay.</p>
<h2><img alt=""Characters"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/24688081/Banners/banner5.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Characters""/></h2>
<p>Our characters are built upon our unique combat philosophy. Each character emphasizes different combat skills; one may facilitate speedy attacks and dodging to avoid damage, while another focuses on standing and delivering mighty blows while using a shield to absorb damage. To this end, our character system itself had to be something new and unique; simplicity with flexibility.</p>
<p>Characters are not function specific. In other words, there is no ""tank"" character or ""dps"" character. Rather, characters may each may fulfill a different role depending on build and gear. A vital part of our philosophy on characters is to allow the player to tailor their experience to their playstyle.</p>
<h3>The Characters</h3>
<p><img alt=""The Characters"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/24688081/fwd/portad.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>The game will launch with five characters, each with their own lore and playstyle. They are as follows:</p>
<h3>Swordsman</h3>
<p><br/>Dauntless warrior clad in steel with a mighty shield in one hand and swift death to his enemies in the other. The swordsman is peerless at close quarters; his might overpowering the forces of the wicked as they fall before him.</p>
<p><img alt=""Swordsman"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/24688081/fwd/Knight.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Swordsman""/></p>
<h3>The Wizard</h3>
<p><br/>Deranged and twisted by an unnaturally long life spent standing too close to the Source of ultimate power in the universe, he is a nearly unrecognizable shell of his former humanity; that humanity he sacrificed in pursuit of unlimited power. Though once coursed blood through the veins of a man, now flows the scintillating essence of the universe itself.</p>
<p><img alt=""Wizard"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/24688081/fwd/mago%20sacrecrow%20f.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Wizard""/></p>
<h3>Ranger</h3>
<p><br/>One with nature even as she is one with her bow. Lightning quick and deadly accurate. She knows the truth; that the quickest way to a man's heart is actually a two-and-a-half foot shaft of steel-tipped spruce given flight on the thrum of a bow string from 100 yards.</p>

<h3>Assassin</h3>
<p><br/>Efficient. Professional. Lethal. The Assassin has one job and he executes it with surgical precision and the utmost discretion. Swift and nimble, he is able to able to elude his enemies if (and it’s a big “if”) anything should ever not go according to plan. To quote a metal legend, “Killing is (his) business... and business is good!”</p>
<p><img alt=""Assassin"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/24688081/fwd/assasin%20f.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Assassin""/></p>
<h3>Warden</h3>
<p><br/>A mysterious entity in the form of a man, the Warden has manifested throughout history to hold back the storm in the defense of mankind. Able to part the onslaught of the enemy swarm; to arrest the swift blade of the destroyer; to push back the very breath of the dragon, the Warden has the power to turn the tide of battle and push forward unto victory.<br/><br/>A note on the Warden as far as gameplay. We really wanted to go beyond the normal cleric-type buffer/healer. In keeping with the idea of timing-based combat, the warden's protective abilities require a lot of timing to pull off. An example would be a bubble shield that can cover any players within a set vicinity and deflect all incoming damage, but only lasts about a half-second. The Warden is a powerful character that requires a lot of skill to master.</p>

<h2><img alt=""Game World"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/24688081/Banners/banner6.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Game World""/></h2>
<p>All content in the game will be accessible via a rich, dynamic, open overworld. Here you can explore and find new content, group up with friends, and jump in and take on the best dungeons created by you and the rest of the community. The very best maps earn the right to become a permanent part of the gameworld and its lore.</p>
<h2><img alt=""Loot"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/24688081/Banners/banner7.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Loot""/></h2>
<p>Any aRPG worth its salt will have a compulsively addictive loot system. We place a massive priority on creating interesting loot that has the capacity to complete change the way you play each time you pick up a new item.<br/><br/>Each weapon will have three attributes: base damage, elemental damage, and extra effects.<br/><br/>Base damage is simply the minimum amount of damage a weapon will do per attack.<br/><br/>Elemental damage comes in three forms: Fire, ice and electrical. Enemies in the game may have resistances or weaknesses to any of these three. Each is embellished with a satisfying visual flair.<br/><br/>Where things really get interesting is the Extra Effects. Weapons may exhibit extra effects ranging from fairly mundane modifiers to crit or knockdown chance etc., to far more exotic in rare cases. Some examples of the exotic being a fire-damage weapon that explodes an enemy on last-shot, causing AOE damage; an electrical weapon that chains lightning to a limited number of nearby enemies; an ice weapon with a small chance to completely freeze an enemy on hit; a weapon that on last-shoting an enemy causes them to reanimate for 8 sec and fight for you; a weapon with a very small chance of completely restoring health if you last-shot; a weapon with a very small chance of one-shoting mob-level enemies.... It could get completely crazy! In all of this, balance is an all-important priority.<br/><br/>We hope loot will provide a massively compulsive reason to keep playing and keep searching for the most unique and insane items.<br/>A Word about Art Direction<br/><br/>We are very excited to introduce the world to the art of Humberto Urriola. We've been working with Humberto for a while now and his concepts never cease to amaze us with their out-of-the-box thinking. Take a look at the concept art for our wizard up there and just think if you've ever seen something quite like that. The art in Dungeonforge ranges from quirky, to strange, to dark and twisted and that's just exactly how we like it. Visually, we want to strive to make this the freshest game of this type you've ever played.</p>
<h2><img alt=""Vison"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/24688081/Banners/banner8.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Vision""/></h2>
<p>At the center of our long term vision for the game is a constant influx of fresh new content from the community. We will deliver, not just the map editor tools that allow everyone to create amazing content using the in-built assets, but tools that enable technically savvy users to create and import their own assets. In keeping with the theme of keeping things fresh and dynamic, we will continue to release new assets, both to make things visually interesting and to continually evolve the gameplay.<br/><br/>Themed content is also in the offing with various licenses of popular properties being considered.<br/><br/>It is our hope to build a game with such great gameplay and such powerful tools that we enable a community of extremely creative individuals to rise up around this game. We will support that community and the continued betterment of the game every step of the way, year after year, for as long as there is anyone still playing.</p></div>","A combat-driven RPG fueled by unlimited, fresh, community created content powered by our innovative design tools.

Some examples of the exotic being a fire-damage weapon that explodes an enemy on last-shot, causing AOE damage; an electrical weapon that chains lightning to a limited number of nearby enemies; an ice weapon with a small chance to completely freeze an enemy on hit; a weapon that on last-shoting an enemy causes them to reanimate for 8 sec and fight for you; a weapon with a very small chance of completely restoring health if you last-shot; a weapon with a very small chance of one-shoting mob-level enemies.... It could get completely crazy! In all of this, balance is an all-important priority.We hope loot will provide a massively compulsive reason to keep playing and keep searching for the most unique and insane items.A Word about Art DirectionWe are very excited to introduce the world to the art of Humberto Urriola. We've been working with Humberto for a while now and his concepts never cease to amaze us with their out-of-the-box thinking. Take a look at the concept art for our wizard up there and just think if you've ever seen something quite like that. The art in Dungeonforge ranges from quirky, to strange, to dark and twisted and that's just exactly how we like it. Visually, we want to strive to make this the freshest game of this type you've ever played.

At the center of our long term vision for the game is a constant influx of fresh new content from the community. We will deliver, not just the map editor tools that allow everyone to create amazing content using the in-built assets, but tools that enable technically savvy users to create and import their own assets. In keeping with the theme of keeping things fresh and dynamic, we will continue to release new assets, both to make things visually interesting and to continually evolve the gameplay.Themed content is also in the offing with various licenses of popular properties being considered.It is our hope to build a game with such great gameplay and such powerful tools that we enable a community of extremely creative individuals to rise up around this game. We will support that community and the continued betterment of the game every step of the way, year after year, for as long as there is anyone still playing.",18.0,0,"2 Campaigns

4 purple cubes of 8 mm side lenght(esteemed) 


4 red cubes of 8 mm side lenght(esteemed) 


4 blue cubes of 8 mm side lenght(esteemed) 

 

 
For every round, the first player rolls the white, green, purple, red and blue dice. All the dice will be resolved as they where thrown by the first player. 
The first player is the player who's turn it is to roll the dice for this round. First player change in a clockwise order every round. As a rules of thumb, the pirate with the longest hair/beard start first, but any random method works fine.
The one who rolled the dice takes the white die without changing the result. Then starting clockwise with the player who has the white die, every player is going to choose one of the remaining colored die, also keeping the result the first player rolled.
Next, starting with the player who has the white die and going clockwise, the players solve their dice. The player having the white die always solves it first,  solving the colored die he has choosen afterward.When all the players have solved their dice, the players left of the first player become the new first player, he then roll the dice and a new round begin.

</p><h3>About
Late Date</h3>
<p>We can all relate to the stress associated with date events.
Our app aims to alleviate that stress by benefitting both hosts and guests. It
allows hosts to easily send out invitations and create guest lists, and allows
guests to view those guest lists. It also helps guests to find plus-ones
through our date finder. Late Date suggests dates in the following ways: 1)
based on who was recommended as a good date in the past 2) randomly using
Facebook friends and friends of friends OR 3) through specific criteria set out
by you. Late Date is the coolest multipurpose event management app in the game!</p>

Created by veteran Gaming Bar Event Manager and co-owner of board/card/video game bar Beta Bar, Skaidris Gunsmith. Suddenly Drunk is the culmination of years of research in how people enjoy drinking and playing games.




Pick your favorite board or card game. Suddenly Drunk works best with simple party games like Cards Against Humanity, Jenga or Uno but can be played with ANY turn based board or card game.
Before playing your turn, draw a card from the Suddenly Drunk deck.
It will either be an Instant or Anytime card.

If it's an Instant, you read the card out loud and do what it says then discard the card.
If it's an Anytime card, you read it to yourself, place it face down in front of you and put it's effects into play at any point during the game no matter who's turn it is.

Apart from doing the obvious of getting you tipsy the role of Suddenly Drunk is to help keep the party going.Rule and Minigame Cards are designed to take people out of their comfort zones and lighten the atmosphere.Soon rules will be stacking up and people will be falling over their own words to try and remember if they're supposed to be speaking in third person or if they have to dance whenever they go anywhere.

</div><div> <p>Diz que ainda não é nesta encarnação que vou fazer a maratona (não se preocupem!), mas este presentinho já vai dar para uns bailados no quarteirão, com a vantagem de que, como dizia o outro, ""ginasticar dá mais força ao coração"" e eu preciso disso! </p>
<p>Dão-me uma ajuda?</p>
<p>---------</p>
<p></p>
<p>I love outdoors and since I moved I've been thinking about getting a bicycle to wander around and to go shopping in the area.</p>
<p>My birthday's arriving, and inspired by friends who have had similar initiatives in their birthdays, I decided to put my fears aside and venture myself into this crowd funding thing <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">to propose you offering me a present with the </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">meaning of freedom!</span></p>
<p>This thing of Indie Gogo, forces me to ask for a minimum of 500 €. I've been searching and there are cheaper bikes and other far more expensive than that. The whole amount that I gather here will be fully used to buy a bike and if, there's enough room to it, to buy some accessories like a locker and some other basics that I don't have.</p>

</div></div>","Adoro ar livre e desde que me mudei que ando a pensar em arranjar uma bicicleta para dar umas passeatas e para ir às compras por estas bandas. 
Os meus anos estão aí e, inspirada por amigos que tiveram iniciativas semelhantes nos seus aniversários, decidi perder os medos e aventurar-me nesta coisa do crowdfunding para vos propor oferecerem-me um presente com o significado da liberdade!
 Esta coisa do Indie Gogo obriga-me a mínimo de 500€. Andei a ver e há para aí bicicletas mais baratas e outras bem mais caras que isso. A totalidade do valor que se reunir aqui será integralmente usado para comprar uma bicicleta e, se der, alguns acessórios como um cadeado e outros básicos que eu não tenho. 
As Wacky Races inspiraram-me a pensar que cada pessoa tem o seu transporte. A bicicleta que vou comprar vai depender de quanto conseguir reunir aqui. Pelo que já andei a ver, está-me cá a parecer que há-de sair uma taylor made nº5!!
 Diz que ainda não é nesta encarnação que vou fazer a maratona (não se preocupem!), mas este presentinho já vai dar para uns bailados no quarteirão, com a vantagem de que, como dizia o outro, ""ginasticar dá mais força ao coração"" e eu preciso disso! 
Dão-me uma ajuda?

I love outdoors and since I moved I've been thinking about getting a bicycle to wander around and to go shopping in the area.
My birthday's arriving, and inspired by friends who have had similar initiatives in their birthdays, I decided to put my fears aside and venture myself into this crowd funding thing to propose you offering me a present with the meaning of freedom!
This thing of Indie Gogo, forces me to ask for a minimum of 500 €. I've been searching and there are cheaper bikes and other far more expensive than that. The whole amount that I gather here will be fully used to buy a bike and if, there's enough room to it, to buy some accessories like a locker and some other basics that I don't have.
The Wacky Races inspired me to think that each person has their mean of transportation. The bike I'll buy will depend on how much I can gather here. From what I have seen, sounds like it will be a taylor made # 5 !!
Been told it's not yet in this incarnation I will do the marathon (don't worry!), but this little gift will at least promote some ballets in the block, with the advantage that, as said in the Sesame Street, ""exercising gives more strength to the heart"" and I need that!

<p><b>The game is designed to be a moving artistic experience</b>. The art style of DARQ is a<b> juxtaposition of opposites</b>: it combines<b> 3d locations with 2d hand-drawn characters, beauty with horror, elegance with roughness</b>...The beauty element becomes the means of seduction, inviting the player to enter the world of Lloyd's nightmare.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>We're very particular about the use of light in our game - both as a part of the overall aesthetics, as well as the main component of the gameplay. <b>Light and shadow are almost the main character in DARQ</b>. The game builds tension based on the uncertainty of not knowing what to expect when switching the flashlight on and off. </p>
<p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1450172745/zdlcet61eg09be9ze7e9.jpg"" src=""""/></b></p>
<p>Lloyd is up against much stronger enemies; he has no chance of winning in an open confrontation. Instead, <b>he has to rely on stealth and careful planning to avoid getting detected</b>. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition to hearing, most enemies posses good sight. That's why <b>sneaking by would often require switching the flashlight off. </b>When the light is off, it becomes crucial to listen closely to the sounds made by enemies. <b>Faster and more irregular breathing indicates higher level of alertness, and therefore higher possibility of being detected</b>. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>In DARQ, there will be<i> </i>numerous jump scares</b>, however we're doing our best not to make them cheesy or conventional.<b> A jump scare will never occur for the sake of an easy scare</b>. It will always result from the story. </p>

</div></div>","DARQ tells the story of Lloyd, a boy who becomes aware of the fact that he is dreaming. To Lloyd's misfortune, the dream quickly turns into a nightmare and all attempts to wake up end in failure. While exploring the darkest corners of his subconscious, Lloyd learns how to survive the nightmare by bending the laws of physics and manipulating the fluid fabric of the dream world. 
  
In DARQ, sound plays a very important role. There are sections of the game that take place in absolute darkness and in order to navigate the environment, Lloyd has to rely on the location of sounds. 
 
 



Psychological horror game about lucid dreaming.

Unique artstyle combining 2d and 3d graphics.

Shining-like pacing, relying on a slow build and creepy atmosphere rather than gore and violence. 

Music written by Hollywood film composer Wlad Marhulets.


Puzzles that involve bending the laws of physics (walking on walls and ceilings, levitating), manipulating the dream world (creating items, spawning doors and entire locations), collecting and using found objects, and avoiding enemies. 

Emphasis on sound - some parts of the game involve navigating the environment in complete darkness, which makes the player rely heavily on the location of sounds.

Randomly generated elements of the gameplay (enemy spawn locations, objects, some locations). No walkthrough is the same. 

Lots of interactive objects and characters that will unfold the story and help Lloyd find answers about the meaning of his journey.

Dynamic dream world - in DARQ, visiting a room for the second time might yield a surprising result. You might find that some details have changed, or maybe even the entire room got replaced with a new one.

Multiple endings, depending on the choices you make throughout your journey.


 
 

The game is designed to be a moving artistic experience. The art style of DARQ is a juxtaposition of opposites: it combines 3d locations with 2d hand-drawn characters, beauty with horror, elegance with roughness...The beauty element becomes the means of seduction, inviting the player to enter the world of Lloyd's nightmare.
 
 

We're very particular about the use of light in our game - both as a part of the overall aesthetics, as well as the main component of the gameplay. Light and shadow are almost the main character in DARQ. The game builds tension based on the uncertainty of not knowing what to expect when switching the flashlight on and off. 

Lloyd is up against much stronger enemies; he has no chance of winning in an open confrontation. Instead, he has to rely on stealth and careful planning to avoid getting detected. 
 
In addition to hearing, most enemies posses good sight. That's why sneaking by would often require switching the flashlight off. When the light is off, it becomes crucial to listen closely to the sounds made by enemies. Faster and more irregular breathing indicates higher level of alertness, and therefore higher possibility of being detected. 
 
In DARQ, there will be numerous jump scares, however we're doing our best not to make them cheesy or conventional. A jump scare will never occur for the sake of an easy scare. It will always result from the story. 
 


Enemies differ from one another in a variety of ways. Some of them are scared of light, others are attracted to it. There are monsters who are blind  or have their eyes covered (see the picture above). Every encounter with a monster in DARQ requires a different strategy. 

 




WLAD MARHULETS - Producer / Music ComposerHi, I'm Wlad  - the founder of Unfold Games and the producer of DARQ. I'm also a five time ASCAP Award winning film composer. I'm fortunate to have worked with Marco Beltrami on such films as Hitman: Agent 47, starring Rupert Friend and Zachary Quinto, The Giver,starring Meryl Streep, November Man, starring Pierce Brosnan, and others. DARQ is my dream project to work on, both as a producer and a composer.  




DAMIAN MARHULETS - Co-Producer / ProgrammerHey, my name is Damian. I'm a co-producer of DARQ and a programmer. I'm also the founder of Marhulets Agency. We represent innovative multimedia projects, such as this game. Our activities encompass direction and production of pioneering video games, animation and artistic interactive audiovisual projects.



  We are aiming at PC and MAC release on Steam (currently on Greenlight!). If we surpass our goal by $10.000, we will be able to afford preparing iOS and Android releases (see ""Stretch Goals""). 
 
  


 

 

The exact release date is to be announced, but we are hoping to release DARQ on STEAM later in 2016. There are multiple factors that come into play, one of which being how much we manage to raise. Surpassing our goal will allow us to expand our team, which will speed up the process. In the meantime, please vote for us on STEAM GREENLIGHT! 

 

We set our goal at $20.000, which the amount that will allow us to hire an additional programmer for the period of 5-6 months, as well as to hire voice actors who will add life to our characters. If we don't meet our goal, the game will be finished, but the development process will take much longer than expected and we won't be able to add voice over (which is an important part of the concept). 

We will also need to purchase a license of Unity PRO Engine to take full advantage of the graphic capabilities it has to offer. 


IF WE RAISE $30.000, we're going to release the game on iOS and Android.

IF WE RAISE $40.000,we're going to record the soundtrack with a real orchestra (listen to a sample of live music to see what kind of difference live recording makes) 


IF WE RAISE MORE THAN $40.000,we're going to expand our team by adding additional programmers, artists, and level designers to significantly shorten the development time. 
Pledging to our campaign is not only about money. As a backer, you will become a part of the exciting journey of building a unique video game with revolutionary features.

<h3>What We're About</h3>
I have been an avid player of simulated pet games for years. Recently, a friend approached me with an idea. She wante to make a game like no other. She wanted to create a game like no other. A game where you are the animal instead of just looking in from an outside view. And so this was born. Together we're working to create a new pay-to-play game that can be fun for all ages.</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
The funds from this campaign will go to 3 places.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>1. $160 -&gt; Artist. Because the site needs art. Specifically fully customizable breed artwork.</div>
<div>2. $40 -&gt; Hosting/Domain name. Without these, there can't even be hope of a site.</div>
<div>3. $300 -&gt; Programming. This will just brush the surface. The programming will likely cost $1000-1500.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>But that's only $500! Where does that other $25 go?</strong></div>
<div>As you likely know, IndieGoGo takes a cut of the profits. That $25 is our leeway so that we can maximize the amount we are able to collect.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In exchange for donating, everyone that donates will get to be a tester on the site as well as getting a full free year of gameplay after the site opens. Additionally, donators will get a special item that will be available only to donators.</div>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
Even if you can't donate, there are other ways you can help out. You can advertise on facebook, twitter, and tumblr. Tell your friends. Even if we can't get enough donations, at least we'll be able to get support!</div></div>","What We're About

<h2><strong>Bamboo Combat</strong></h2>
<p>Bamboo Combat is a<strong> free multiplayer game</strong> for all ages and operating systems (<strong>Windows, Linux, Mac</strong>) and is also available for most <strong>Web Browsers</strong> if you do not wish to download it. We also wish to support as many languages as possible! We currently have <strong>English, Spanish and Finnish</strong> translations, and we will be able to add <strong>more languages</strong> depending on how much money we raise.</p>
<h2><strong>Details</strong></h2>
<div style=""margin-left: 15px;"">In Bamboo Combat your character is a panda. You can customize your panda in the registration stage, but be warned- you can only customize it once!</div>
<p><img alt=""Bamboo Custom Panda Editor"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.kelmi.net/bamboo/indiegogo/customizex580.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 15px;""><strong>What? Why a panda?</strong></h3>
<div style=""margin-left: 15px;"">Well, we wanted to give Bamboo Combat a professional look that could also be casual enough for both children and adults to enjoy.</div>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 15px;""><strong>Ok ok, but tell me more, what is this all about??</strong></h3>
<div style=""margin-left: 15px;"">The objective of Bamboo Combat is to become a powerful panda, but how?<br/><br/> Easy, in Bamboo everything happens while the round is in play. A ranked match must consist of a minimum of 4 players and a maximum of 14 in which the winner receives 10 points and the rest gain 2 points. However, a tie is possible if by the end of the round there is still more than 1 player alive; the remaining players will receive 10 points each. You can play an unranked match if the number of players in the room is less than 4.</div>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 15px;""><strong>Points? What for?</strong></h3>
<div style=""margin-left: 15px;"">The points are useful for buying items and spells. You can buy items for your head, body, nose, and paws. These items will give you advantages over other players and a customized look.<br/><br/> On the other hand you can buy spells which will give you unique powers and can enable you to defeat your opponents. You can choose your favourite spell branch such as fire, ice, etc.</div>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 15px;""><strong>I don’t like it! Those players with the best spells and items will always win...</strong></h3>
<div style=""margin-left: 15px;"">Absolutely not. Bamboo Combat's attack system is manual and you have to aim and calculate the trajectory of the spell. We promise that the best ranked player of Bamboo will have to work hard if they want to defeat you; everything is possible with enough practice! Try a few unranked matches before playing ranked ones.</div>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 15px;""><strong>Wow, manually aim and calculate the trajectory? That sounds really hard and slow to get used to!</strong></h3>
<div style=""margin-left: 15px;"">Again, absolutely not. Bamboo Combat is very simple, funny and enjoyable to play! We promise! Please watch the video if you haven't already.</div>
<h2><strong>Rooms, matches and maps</strong></h2>
<p>You are able to create rooms and specify the maximum number of players allowed in as well as create an entry password. Also you will be able to choose from a range of match options such as solo match, team match, etc..<br/><br/> Match duration will be automatically adjusted according to the number of players. <br/><br/> Maps are very important in Bamboo Combat. When a match starts, Bamboo Combat will load a random map from a list of hundreds of maps.</p>
<p align=""center""><img alt=""groundart1.png"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://kelmi.net/bamboo/indiegogo/groundart1.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/> The room leader may start the match as they see fit.</p>
<h2><strong>Tell me more about items and spells!</strong></h2>
<p>The items not only give you advantages but they can also cause a few disadvantages. Each item has the possibility of giving you an advantage (such as health), or two advantages (such as health and increased spell range) or it could also take away health and add damage! In you lies the power to create the best combination that matches your fighting style.</p>
<p><img alt=""makingof1.png"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://kelmi.net/bamboo/indiegogo/makingof1.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p align=""center""><img alt=""profile1.png"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://kelmi.net/bamboo/indiegogo/profile1.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></p>
<p>Spells can be short, medium or long range and they can have different behaviours and ways of launching such as straight or radial.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Brotherhoods</strong></h2>
<p>Players are able to create brotherhoods which are composed and integrated by multiple players. Brotherhoods will unlock new spells and items according to the global rank and stats of the brotherhood. When you join a brotherhood you will automatically receive the spells and items that your brotherhood has unlocked, but joining a new brotherhood will erase the items and spells you received in your previous brotherhood.</p>
<h2><strong>HD Graphics</strong></h2>
<p>Although Bamboo Combat is a 2D game, the design is made with extreme care and we put all our efforts into making a game with very high visual quality.</p>
<h2><strong>Fun</strong></h2>
<p>Above all, Bamboo Combat is really fun, dynamic and simple to play.</p>

We currently live together in Finland and we have been developing Bamboo Combat for about 4 or 5 months; this is our first attempt at creating an online game. We have gotten a lot of inspiration from the games we've played in the past and Bamboo Combat is an attempt to make a game we would love to play.<br/><br/> We have spent a lot of money on the basic licenses that we need to make our games legal. We are very clear with what we have in mind and what we want in the future- and that is to develop games together without money being an issue - and why not become a future video game company?<br/><br/> I started programming when I was 12 years old and 3 years later I sold my old video games console to buy my first game engine.

We need food to survive while developing the game.
 
UPDATE: We decided to make more specific and clear why we need your help. Here's a short summary!

This game was 40 Winks, also known as Ruff and Tumble in Europe. However, in 1999, due to a slew of bad decisions by GT Interactive, the company lost millions of dollars of revenue. These financial troubles plagued GT Interactive throughout the following two years. </p><p>To stay afloat, GT Interactive began downsizing operations and selling popular game franchises. Eventually the financial strain became too much, and they were acquired by Infogrames. </p><p>The Infogrames acquisition brought with it shakeups within GT Interactive including, but not limited to, cancelling projects and pressing the “kill” button on other games that were in development. </p><p>While 40 Winks was able to see release on the original PlayStation console, the Nintendo 64 port, which was under development around the time Infogrames became involved, was not as lucky. The N64 version of 40 Winks was cancelled and until recently thought to be lost to history and time itself. </p><p>Nearly 17 years later Piko Interactive have pulled 40 Winks out of limbo and plan to give it a fair chance to shine on the Nintendo 64.</p><h1>Who We Are</h1><p>For those that have not heard of us, Piko Interactive is a game developer and publisher focusing on retro gaming. We actively develop and produce new games for old consoles.  </p><div> </div><div>
<p>Our catalog includes games for the NES, SNES, Sega Genesis, Game Boy Advance, Atari Jaguar, and digital releases for PC.</p>
<p>We have been in business since 2013 and have brought to the retro scene a lot of great projects in their original physical form. </p>
<h1>Why Crowdfund</h1>Crowdfunding is a wonderful place to reach people that love retro gaming. We come to Indiegogo InDemand because this is the very first time anyone has attempted to release a Nintendo 64 game since the console was discontinued. As with the first time for anything, there are additional costs to get the project off the ground.  </div><div>
<p><br/>Launching a new game for a new console requires production of PCBs, toolings, packaging, and other details to basically start mass producing Nintendo 64 games again. Funds acquired in this project will pay for the manufacture of a working PCB that is compatible with the Nintendo 64. Then work will commence on getting the cartridges done, designing the package and insert, and if stretch goals are met – even more cool stuff.</p>

</div></div>","Back StoryIIn 1998 GT Interactive commissioned Eurocom to create a game. This game was 40 Winks, also known as Ruff and Tumble in Europe. However, in 1999, due to a slew of bad decisions by GT Interactive, the company lost millions of dollars of revenue. These financial troubles plagued GT Interactive throughout the following two years. To stay afloat, GT Interactive began downsizing operations and selling popular game franchises. Eventually the financial strain became too much, and they were acquired by Infogrames. The Infogrames acquisition brought with it shakeups within GT Interactive including, but not limited to, cancelling projects and pressing the “kill” button on other games that were in development. While 40 Winks was able to see release on the original PlayStation console, the Nintendo 64 port, which was under development around the time Infogrames became involved, was not as lucky. The N64 version of 40 Winks was cancelled and until recently thought to be lost to history and time itself. Nearly 17 years later Piko Interactive have pulled 40 Winks out of limbo and plan to give it a fair chance to shine on the Nintendo 64.Who We AreFor those that have not heard of us, Piko Interactive is a game developer and publisher focusing on retro gaming. We actively develop and produce new games for old consoles.   
Our catalog includes games for the NES, SNES, Sega Genesis, Game Boy Advance, Atari Jaguar, and digital releases for PC.
We have been in business since 2013 and have brought to the retro scene a lot of great projects in their original physical form. 
Why CrowdfundCrowdfunding is a wonderful place to reach people that love retro gaming. We come to Indiegogo InDemand because this is the very first time anyone has attempted to release a Nintendo 64 game since the console was discontinued. As with the first time for anything, there are additional costs to get the project off the ground.  
Launching a new game for a new console requires production of PCBs, toolings, packaging, and other details to basically start mass producing Nintendo 64 games again. Funds acquired in this project will pay for the manufacture of a working PCB that is compatible with the Nintendo 64. Then work will commence on getting the cartridges done, designing the package and insert, and if stretch goals are met – even more cool stuff.
Funds Break Down
NOTE: Funds Allocation are just approximations, there may be changes in costs, other sections will need more funds than estimated than other.

40 Winks is an action platformer where you control brother and sister, Ruff and Tumble. Your goal is to collect 40 Winks scattered around the world to stop an evil man called Nitekap. Nitekap wants to turn the winks into hood-winks who are responsible for giving children nightmares.
Game Features:

Transform into different characters! Attack as a stealth ninja, fight as ferocious monster, or fly into action as a super hero!
Tons of mini-games as well! Race dragons, strap on a rocket, and more!
6 themed levels - a scary castle, shipwreck city, outer space, deep down underwater, back to the prehistoric world of T-Rex and giant wasps and into the nightmare world of ghosts and monsters.
Co-op 2 player mode exclusive only to the N64 version.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Selestial Esports is an organization  comprised of gamers across the globe who have experience in many different aspects of the industry. From Esports competition to content creation our members have seen it all. We’re here to create the world’s first community driven organization, to give a voice to gamers, and to directly help gamers accomplish their goals. We believe this is an extremely important time to launch a community driven competitive gaming organization because Esports is in its pioneering phase. Through traditional sports and entertainment we can see that there are many sports teams that function without considering their fans. We’re here to change that in the newest form of sport, Esports. If you’re able to contribute to this project, you will be embarking on a journey that will enhance the community’s gaming experience. From applications of VR, AI, and apparel technology, we’re here to bridge the gap between technology and gaming.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are requesting a $100,000 backing from the community to start Selestial. This is a flexible goal, meaning, even if we don't meet our initial goal, Selestial will still launch and all of our backers receive what they were promised. We chose this because Selestial is a project that will be brought to life by the community. Of course, as a special thanks for supporting our platform and helping to build Selestial, we have very exclusive perks available during this campaign only including Selestial apparel, precursors to our programmable LED apparel line, exclusive designs, special discount offers,meetings with Selestial team members, and much more in the provided perks section. These offers and designs will never be distributed again after the campaign is over. On top of that, we will be adding a backer crest to our apparel and some of our designs to show that you supported Selestial from the very beginning.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We will always be completely transparent with our community. The largest risk we face right now is finding out if the gaming community wants an organization to bring their ideas to life.

However, we’re confident we can overcome this challenge because Selestial is formed by these same fans and gamers. From sitting down and discussing the weak points of our industry, Selestial is our solution to the current hardships our industry faces.</p>

<p>We are two guys from the North of the Netherlands. We share a passion of board and card games. We already made two nice games and now we want to make a business out of it.<br/></p>
<p>Our dream is to make board- and card games which make people happy. Games with beautiful artwork for a good price. Why? Because we love to play with friends or family and we want to share that feeling with you all. <br/></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need 5000,- euro to print the game and pay the artwork.</p>
<p>If you support us you'll get of course the game. It contains 110 cards with 9 different circus artist, a box and the game rules. Free delivery in the Netherlands (other countries 2 euro extra).</p>

<h3><b>Ok, Let's see how IVTG works : ))</b></h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The invention presents infinitely
variable gear mechanical tra<span>nsmission, in which the power
transmission takes place via interlocking hemispheres toothed in a logarithmic spiral
way. The transmission smoothly obtains power and changes the parameters of
movement – torque and angular velocity without any loss of skid of cooperating
transmission components.</span></p>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span>
<p>This transmission can change seamlessly through an infinite number
of effective gear ratios between maximum and minimum values. This
contrasts with other mechanical transmissions that offer a fixed
number of gear ratios. The flexibility of a this gear allows the
input shaft to always maintain a constant angular velocity.</p>
<p>This invention can provide better fuel economy than other
transmissions by enabling the engine to run at its most efficient
revolutions per minute (RPM) for a range of vehicle speeds. It can
also be used to build a kinetic energy recovery system.</p>
<p>Alternatively it can be used to maximize the performance of a
vehicle by allowing the engine to turn at the RPM at which it
produces peak power. This is typically higher than the RPM that
achieves peak efficiency.</p>
<p>An example of the invention is the
following solution.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437683859/btmdnc5qdxxyvt6hk1to.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

centrally on the shafts (4) and (5).</p>
<p>The spherical rack (3), tangentially
mediates between the racks (1), (2) and is centrally mounted on the
shaft (6).</p>
<p>Hemispherical rack (1), (2) and the
spherical rack (3) teeth are arranged on the track of logarithmic
spiral curve, Figure 9, Figure 10, making the teeth of these gears
intersect at the same angle, thus reducing friction, grinding,
vibration and noise. The teeth mesh without causing jerks and do not
emit unpleasant sounds known from traditional gear rack.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437684069/rbfgfpwmpsmnqi2fyiif.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Racks (1) with (3) and (2) with (3) are
always relative to one another in the tangential points, respectively
identical to each other, forming always the same tangential relative
circles, respectively (X) for the racks (1) with (3), fig. 13 (Y) for
the racks (2) with (3).</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The shaft (6) is movable and can change
its position in points (A) and (B) with respect to the axis of
rotation at a point (C) along a trajectory (D) and (E).</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>A rack (2) is integral with the cog (7)
via the shaft (5). The shaft (5) is movable and can change its
position in points ( I) and ( J) with respect to the axis of rotation
at a point (H) along a trajectory (F) and (G).</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The shaft (4) is coupled to a drive
source, e.g. by coupling to the crankshaft of the internal combustion
engine or electric engine, it transmits a rotational movement to the
hemispherical gear (2). 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Through mutually intermeshing
hemispherical racks (1), (2) and spherical rack (3) movement is
transferred without slipping on the cog (7) centrally mounted on a
shaft (5) and then to perpendicular cog (9) mounted centrally at a
point (K).</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Cog (10) is centrally mounted at a
point (H) and is tangent to the cog wheels ( 9 ) and (11) to pass
rotary movement to cog (12) and then onto the shaft (13).</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Cog wheeels (9), (10) and (11) contact
one another at the periphery - they have teeth on the wheel rim.</p>
<p>In addition, the cog (9) and (11) have
perpendicular teeth so as to contact each other with a cog (7) and
(12).</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The concept of the continuously
variable transmission is based on seamless change through an infinite
number of effective gear ratios between maximum and minimum values. 
</p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437684405/fczn91lperprrgxcpwkx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p><br/></p>
<p>The constant torque on the shaft (4) /
e.g. coupled with the motor / is changed into variable torque on the
shaft (13) / e.g. driving wheels / and the flexibility of this gear
allows the input shaft (4) to always maintain a constant angular
velocity while output shaft (13) angular velocity is changed
raltively.

input drive shaft (4) relative to the output shaft (13) is effected
by variation of the angle and position of the shaft (5) – thanks to
the control vane (8) and for shaft (6) – control vane (14).</span><br/></p>
<p>Control vane (8) integral with a
hemispherical rack (2), cog (7), (9) and the shaft (5) is moveable in
points (I) and (J) with respect to the axis of rotation at a point
(H) along a trajectory (F) and (G).</p>
<p>Control vane (14) integral with a
spherical rack (3), cog (10) and the shaft (6) moves in points (A)
and (B) with respect to the axis of rotation at a point (C) along a
trajectory (D) and (E).</p>
<p>Control vanes (8) and (14 ) may be
moved mechanicallly, hydraulically, pneumatically or electrically
/coupled with an electric motor controlled by a processor /.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Changes in the angle and the position
of (8) and (14) are simultaneous and synchronized e.g. with the aid
of gear in such a way that turning the control vane (8) clockwise to
the rotation axis at the point (H) decreases radius of the tangent
circle (Y) arising at the interface between racks (2) and (3), while
the control vane (14) performs rotation clockwise in (C) causing the
increased radius of the tangent circle (X) formed at the interface of
racks (1) and (3). In this way, the peripheral speed of the tangent
circle (X) is increased, while the peripheral speed of the tangent
circle (Y) is reduced.</p>
<p>Therefore, at the constant angular
velocity of the shaft (4) and its constant torque  the value of
angular velosity of the shaft (5) and (13) is increased at the same
time the torque of the shaft (5) and (13) is decreased.</p>
<p>Similarly, changing the position of the
control vanes (8) and (14) by rotating them clockwise with respect to
points (H) and (C), at the constant angular velocity of the shaft (4)
and its constant torque the value of angular velocity of the shaft
(5) and (13) is decreased at the same time the torque of the shaft
(5) and (13) is increased.</p>
<p>By changing the position of the control
vanes (8) and (14 ) at a constant velocity of the shaft (4) and its
constant torque, finally smooth and seamless change take place in the
velocity of the shaft (13) and is followed by the smooth torque
change of shaft (13).</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The greatest advantage of the
continuously variable transmission of the hemispherical racks is that
power and torque loss is reduced thanks to the usage of racks and
cogs (instead of chain or belt) and a unique durability compared to
the solution with variator .</p>

Spychalskiinventor/Below exact
explenation of IVTG idea/What We Need

All our researches indicate that phases of prototype feasibility,
definition, design, realization, verification, validation, used components,
systems and machines should be very close to U$ 0,5 mln.
The unique advantage of IVTG is that transmission smoothly obtains power
and changes the parameters of movement – torque and angular velocity without
any loss or skid of cooperating transmission components (thanks to interlocking
hemispheres).
Cooperating transmission components - interlocking hemispheres toothed in a
logarithmic spiral way - that have never been designed, qualified and
tested before, are challenges that lie at the cutting edge. 
What we need is embedded
critical know-how, ultra-precision design capabilities, expert verification,
tooling and managed transfer to prototype.

Thanks to combined metrology,
mechanical design, system and software architecture capabilities we will be
able to realize precision components of the IVTG prototype. 
Difficulty and complexity of all mentioned factors are above high but
thanks to the raised funds, the ability to take our idea, our IVTG invention and transform
it into prototype or manufacturable product will be completed.

All the raised funds are strictly
intended for further development of the IVTG.
All the contributors will be
granted full access to monitored realization of the strategy and, at the same
time, appraise our IVTG team on what has been implemented. 





The
Impact
The
impact of the IVTG invention will change globally perception of the
power transmission in vast business range of automotive, agriculture,
aircraft, defense, energy, manufacturing, technology and
transportation industries. 



Advantages of IVTG shown on
automobile example: 
IVTG provides smooth
and ""stepless"" ratio changes, unlike conventional transmission
systems that use sets of fixed gears.
IVTG selects automatically the optimal gear ratio based on road and driving conditions by
keeping the engine in its ideal power
range that benefits of fuel
economy. 
IVTG means seamless,
enjoyable acceleration and a smooth ride, and predictable driving
means more fun behind the wheel.
IVTG eliminates
shocks when changing gears, giving linear
response and allowing the engine to run
quieter, making it an exceptional
transmission solution.
Thanks to completely new and uniquely designed interlocking hemispheres toothed in a
logarithmic spiral way IVTG is able to transmit high torque and power also reduces
mechanical noise during operation.
IVTG is able to shifts
ratios faster than any the previous gearbox solution, resulting in powerful performance combined with superior
fuel economy.



Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge is to lower IVTG production costs, due to the fact the essential parts of the gear - interlocking hemispheres have never been produced, initial production costs can be relatively high.
This only obstacle can be overcome by popularization of IVTG and mass production which surely have an impact on production costs.

a market range gives infinite opportunities and a skyrocketing popularity.
Assuming
that this invention will attract lots of media attention, TV reports, press
pictures of the prototype and many other forms of presentations, all
contributors will have a chance to be a part of the IVTG team.  
 Each
contribution of US$ 49 will bring the contributor 1x1 cm of laser engrave on
the metal cover, integral part of the prototype. 
Each
perk presents different size of the laser engrave due to multiplied amount of
US$49, bigger contribution - bigger size.  
We
imagine that the metal cover of the prototype will fit 10 000 names or logos in
the size of 1x1 cm, the metal cover will be 100x100 cm in total.  
The
TOP US$500 perk will be very special for us and the contributor : )) 






We will do
our best to daily update space availability and send updated PDF file to the
contributors.
Please mind that
engrave space availability on the IVTG is limited, so please hurry up, and please contribute now even a little bit : ))


We really do hope that pretty soon after the market launch of the IVTG the Smithsonian - the
world’s largest museum and research complex will be interested in
exhibiting IVTG prototype (with your name or logo engraved).
Or do you wish us to place the IVTG prototype in other museum:
The Deutsches Museum, Munich, Germany
 The Academy of Natural Science of Drexel
University, Phildelphia, USA
Universeum, Gothenburg, Sweden
The Exploratorium, San Francisco, USA
Let us know your suggestions in Comments, we will be glad to
hear from you today.

Other
Ways You Can Help

All
kind of positive contribution will be very appreciated. 


The
more people will be aware of IVTG the more demand for production is
created, so please share this invention with others.  

Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn, are very, very welcome : ))










Ok, Let's see how IVTG works : ))




The invention presents infinitely
variable gear mechanical transmission, in which the power
transmission takes place via interlocking hemispheres toothed in a logarithmic spiral
way. The transmission smoothly obtains power and changes the parameters of
movement – torque and angular velocity without any loss of skid of cooperating
transmission components.

This transmission can change seamlessly through an infinite number
of effective gear ratios between maximum and minimum values. This
contrasts with other mechanical transmissions that offer a fixed
number of gear ratios. The flexibility of a this gear allows the
input shaft to always maintain a constant angular velocity.
This invention can provide better fuel economy than other
transmissions by enabling the engine to run at its most efficient
revolutions per minute (RPM) for a range of vehicle speeds. It can
also be used to build a kinetic energy recovery system.
Alternatively it can be used to maximize the performance of a
vehicle by allowing the engine to turn at the RPM at which it
produces peak power. This is typically higher than the RPM that
achieves peak efficiency.
An example of the invention is the
following solution.






Hemispherical rack (1), (2) are mounted
centrally on the shafts (4) and (5).
The spherical rack (3), tangentially
mediates between the racks (1), (2) and is centrally mounted on the
shaft (6).
Hemispherical rack (1), (2) and the
spherical rack (3) teeth are arranged on the track of logarithmic
spiral curve, Figure 9, Figure 10, making the teeth of these gears
intersect at the same angle, thus reducing friction, grinding,
vibration and noise. The teeth mesh without causing jerks and do not
emit unpleasant sounds known from traditional gear rack.




Racks (1) with (3) and (2) with (3) are
always relative to one another in the tangential points, respectively
identical to each other, forming always the same tangential relative
circles, respectively (X) for the racks (1) with (3), fig. 13 (Y) for
the racks (2) with (3).


The shaft (6) is movable and can change
its position in points (A) and (B) with respect to the axis of
rotation at a point (C) along a trajectory (D) and (E).


A rack (2) is integral with the cog (7)
via the shaft (5). The shaft (5) is movable and can change its
position in points ( I) and ( J) with respect to the axis of rotation
at a point (H) along a trajectory (F) and (G).


The shaft (4) is coupled to a drive
source, e.g. by coupling to the crankshaft of the internal combustion
engine or electric engine, it transmits a rotational movement to the
hemispherical gear (2). 



Through mutually intermeshing
hemispherical racks (1), (2) and spherical rack (3) movement is
transferred without slipping on the cog (7) centrally mounted on a
shaft (5) and then to perpendicular cog (9) mounted centrally at a
point (K).


Cog (10) is centrally mounted at a
point (H) and is tangent to the cog wheels ( 9 ) and (11) to pass
rotary movement to cog (12) and then onto the shaft (13).


Cog wheeels (9), (10) and (11) contact
one another at the periphery - they have teeth on the wheel rim.
In addition, the cog (9) and (11) have
perpendicular teeth so as to contact each other with a cog (7) and
(12).


The concept of the continuously
variable transmission is based on seamless change through an infinite
number of effective gear ratios between maximum and minimum values. 





The constant torque on the shaft (4) /
e.g. coupled with the motor / is changed into variable torque on the
shaft (13) / e.g. driving wheels / and the flexibility of this gear
allows the input shaft (4) to always maintain a constant angular
velocity while output shaft (13) angular velocity is changed
raltively.  





Smooth motion-parameters change of the
input drive shaft (4) relative to the output shaft (13) is effected
by variation of the angle and position of the shaft (5) – thanks to
the control vane (8) and for shaft (6) – control vane (14).
Control vane (8) integral with a
hemispherical rack (2), cog (7), (9) and the shaft (5) is moveable in
points (I) and (J) with respect to the axis of rotation at a point
(H) along a trajectory (F) and (G).
Control vane (14) integral with a
spherical rack (3), cog (10) and the shaft (6) moves in points (A)
and (B) with respect to the axis of rotation at a point (C) along a
trajectory (D) and (E).
Control vanes (8) and (14 ) may be
moved mechanicallly, hydraulically, pneumatically or electrically
/coupled with an electric motor controlled by a processor /.


Changes in the angle and the position
of (8) and (14) are simultaneous and synchronized e.g. with the aid
of gear in such a way that turning the control vane (8) clockwise to
the rotation axis at the point (H) decreases radius of the tangent
circle (Y) arising at the interface between racks (2) and (3), while
the control vane (14) performs rotation clockwise in (C) causing the
increased radius of the tangent circle (X) formed at the interface of
racks (1) and (3). In this way, the peripheral speed of the tangent
circle (X) is increased, while the peripheral speed of the tangent
circle (Y) is reduced.
Therefore, at the constant angular
velocity of the shaft (4) and its constant torque  the value of
angular velosity of the shaft (5) and (13) is increased at the same
time the torque of the shaft (5) and (13) is decreased.
Similarly, changing the position of the
control vanes (8) and (14) by rotating them clockwise with respect to
points (H) and (C), at the constant angular velocity of the shaft (4)
and its constant torque the value of angular velocity of the shaft
(5) and (13) is decreased at the same time the torque of the shaft
(5) and (13) is increased.
By changing the position of the control
vanes (8) and (14 ) at a constant velocity of the shaft (4) and its
constant torque, finally smooth and seamless change take place in the
velocity of the shaft (13) and is followed by the smooth torque
change of shaft (13).


The greatest advantage of the
continuously variable transmission of the hemispherical racks is that
power and torque loss is reduced thanks to the usage of racks and
cogs (instead of chain or belt) and a unique durability compared to
the solution with variator .

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<div>   My name is Ian Houser, and I'm a designer currently trying to finish developing and publishing an interactive application on the iOS and Android mobile platforms. The application is a continuation of multiple projects I've been working on for one of my best friends, Jeffrey Kutsch. This particular leg of the project is a mobile version of Jeff's <a href=""http://www.jeffykutsch.com/my-soundboard-new/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">soundboard</a>.</div>
<div>   Jeffrey (or Jeffy, as he prefers) Kutsch is one of the most loved individuals I've ever known. Due to complications at birth, Jeffy has had significant trouble with brain development and multiple serious physical problems. This might slow ordinary people down, but not Jeffy. But then again, Jeffy could never possibly be categorized as ordinary.</div>
<div>   Jeffy is one of the funniest people you may ever come across. It's for that reason I created a website for him a couple years ago-- I couldn't help but share him with the world. Since then we've gone on to make multiple ""<a href=""http://www.jeffykutsch.com/movies-ive-made/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title=""movies"">movies</a>"", and other fun projects. Each year his Halloween party is our area's biggest event of the year, usually featuring a short film we make. These projects are the easiest and most effective way we can make Jeffy feel loved and happy. </div>
<div>   His soundboard, though, is far and away the most popular feature of his website. It draws hundreds of visitors each month who just can't get enough Jeffy. I'm continually told how if  people aren't feeling great one day, they go on Jeffy's soundboard or website and it cheers them up. <b style=""font-weight: bolder;"">That's why I want to make this free app. </b>
</div>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>   Not only would this app be a great way to share Jeffy's humor and spirit with a huge segment of people, but it would also make Jeff one of the happiest people in the world. His website is already his favorite thing-- he can't stop talking about it. His mother says she can still hear him in his room playing with the soundboard for hours on end cracking up with each word. Jeffy hasn't had much good news lately, on account of multiple health and other concerns, and it's my desire to keep him positive and happy no matter what. It's my desire to show the world what a blessing someone with mental disabilities can be.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>   The bulk of the funding would go to buying the Apple Developer account, which is $99. I am personally in a very tight financial situation and cannot continue to support these projects without additional support. The surplus would go to development of future versions, hopefully including more features and support for more platforms. If we do raise significantly more, we'd love to make more movies with proper lighting, props, and special effects. <a href=""http://www.jeffykutsch.com/movies-ive-made/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Check out Jeffy's previous movies if you haven't already!</a></p>

After that hurricane weekend I had purged myself of any

So much so that I want to bring a small film crew with me to GDC to make certain I can keep with the films quality. I need $4,500 to pay for return flights, lodging and meals for the film crew. 

We will be filming interviews with game
developers from all over the world at this years Game Developers Conference
March 5-9, 2012. Attending GDC will also enable us to promote the film and build support from the community the world over. It will also help to promote the documentary while at the
conference by having a proper film crew working on this project. 
Some of the perks we are offering include posters, digital and physical copies of the film, GJD T-Shirts & GJD Hoodies. 
D.A.R.C. Productions Inc. is all about promoting indie game developers & have recently started putting together promotional packages for local Toronto Indies. We are offering a perk on the ""Support Your Local Game Developer"" portion of the Game Jam Documentary website. This perk will include a short biography, company logo and video of your projects. We will work with you to get this put together.

Another reward we are offering for game developers is the opportunity to have me fly to your city and film a one on one interview with you and document your personal experience at a game jam to be used in the film. This personal encounter I think is essential to telling the real story of game jams.

Game Jams are massive events, and this is something that people outside the gaming community have never really peered into. As a maybe overly ambitious perk we will fly to your game jam and document your cities story. Not only will this be used in Game Jam The Documentary film, but we will create a complete trailer of your game jam for you to own.


Any additional funds raised with this campaign will go towards traveling the world, over the next year, to film different game jams for the documentary. We will be looking to film in the cities that contribute the most funding, along with some remote locations, this way we can more accurately document the diversity of game jams

<div> </div>
<div>I’ve always wanted to create a never ending dungeon crawling game.</div>
<p>For example, I loved Dungeon Master when I was young, but what I preferred by far was Captive and its procedural levels, where, after you beat the game, you could still fly to another planet and continue on a new adventure, and so on.</p>
<p>The problem with these procedurals levels is that they can quickly become too repetitive and boring. But what if you had at your disposal a really intuitive level editor to create and tell your own story? What if you also had instant access to all the dungeons created by other people on Earth? On a classic pen and paper role playing game, I personally always enjoyed this moment when I had to quickly draw some dungeon rooms and throw in my players to challenge them with some new traps and monsters.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt=""VS"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://paperdungeons.net/funds/VS.png"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Paper Dungeons was born from this basic idea: a simple dungeon level, drawn on screen, and strong tactical rules where you have to beat the higher monster to win the challenge.</p>
<p>Monsters hit hard, but you get some heals each time you uncover a new tile. If you need direct access to new parts of the dungeon, you can even destroy walls but at great life cost. Fortunately, you can ease your journey with some items, spells and bonuses dispatched around the map. Don’t forget to seek protection from a Deity, or to visit the store to equip your character. Monsters are all neutral and will only advance towards you if you engage them in a fight.</p>

<p>Unlike many games of the same genre, Paper Dungeons’ main gaming mode is a pure puzzle game. Nothing is random: you can see what awaits you in the undiscovered zones. Damages dealt are based on the player or monster level. It all seems predictable and too easy? Don’t be fooled: the game elements are precisely balanced and one single bad choice on your attacks or your moves can be lethal. Each character class has a different gameplay, which means you have to use different tactics to solve the same level. Every new dungeon, your character resets (level and items). Your score is based on the time you spend solving the level.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt=""Streched Goals"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://paperdungeons.net/funds/objectifUK.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;"" title=""Streched Goals""/></div>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>STRETCH GOAL : $13,000 : ADVENTURE GAME </strong></p>
<p>Everything is random here, though it’s calculated on a certain ratio based on your level and your statistics. All monsters and items are placed randomly on the map and you can’t see what’s underneath the undiscovered zone. There’s a roleplaying part, where every time your character levels up, you can choose which statistic to spend your points into. These game mechanics promise an epic fail or epic win depending on luck and the tactic chosen. Every new dungeon (tableau), your character resets (level and items). Again, your score is based on the time you spend solving the level.</p>
<p><strong>STRETCH GOAL : <strong>$</strong>15,000  : ROGUE GAME </strong></p>
<p>This mode has the same rules as the Adventure game, but your character level does NOT reset after each dungeon. Your character keeps leveling up indefinitely until his death. This time, you score is not time dependent, but depends the last level reached by your character.</p>
<p>That means 3 games in one! (Should you back them, else it’s just PUZZLE available).</p>
<p>These three game types can be played in Campaign, Personal or Online mode.</p>

<p><strong>THE EDITOR</strong></p>
<p>This aspect of the game has really been polished to offer the best experience possible. The level creation is easy and fast: use basic tools to draw walls or place monsters and items. Or you can move or erase them with a simple mouse click, without changing your actual tool. Just keep clicking to put all your monsters and items, or one click the dice button to place them semi randomly (depending on your player’s position). Click the [Try] button for a quick test of the level, then go back to Editor mode with the [Escape] button. You can personalize your levels by using special items like indicator panels.</p>
<p>Once saved, you can choose to post your level online for all to enjoy.</p>
<p>At level creation, you can tag some items or monsters that won’t be randomly placed in Adventure or Rogue game mode. This allows you to avoid impossible situations like starting surrounded by walls, without any [Destroy wall] magic book in close proximity.</p>

<p>In most video games we see only the most privileged among us (cisethnic persyns, teens, wizards, dogs, and so on), and those of us who lack privilege and are oppressed by society have been crying out for a game made for them.</p>
<p>Using state of the art game development technology like Windows and RPG Maker 2003, we will create a game where the protagonists go on an epic quest to fight and destroy the Kyriarchy, learning dozens of new adjectives they can describe themselves with along the way.</p>
<h2>What we need</h2>
<p>Making a 100% non-privileged, anti-binary, pro-justice game requires money so that we can afford high quality production values. For example:</p>

<p>Many video games have ""characters"" and <em>Privilege Blaster</em> is no exception.  We have many wonderful concepts for engaging protagonysts, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>a gay Palestinian multiple system with five Israeli headmates</li>
<li>a crystalline paradox from the thirteenth etherplane</li>
<li>a transethnic genderqueer Whovian</li>
<li>a sentient car who identifies as a different model of car</li>
</ul><h3>Level design</h3>
<p>Our protagonysts will battle the forces of the Kyriarchy in many varied locations and environments:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Sbarro at the mall</li>
<li>Africa</li>
<li>atop the Kyriarchiplex Megatower during a raging patriarchy storm</li>
<li>your stepdad's den </li>

You probably know this by now, but almost every volunteer is required to pay for their expenses when volunteering abroad!

The collected money will be used to cover our accomodation cost and inland travel expenses. We are already covering flight, visa, all vaccinations and travel insurance costs by ourselves. We are also going to buy a new set of professional surgical instruments for a head and neck surgery, which patients and hospital staff will profit from greatly. Also when we are gone.

Your donation will not only help us but also give bussines to the poor local community enabling them to develop and thrive. 

By diminishing our costs you will give us the chance to return more frequently which is ultimately our goal!Get the word out and make some noise about our campaign!https://www.facebook.com/pages/Helping-Helps/38...",7.0,0,"2 Campaigns

</h3> <p></p>
<span><p>Remember the magical world of childhood, when everything was so big and fascinating to us,<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">how charmed and enthralled we were by everything?

Using paste and </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">glue, scissors and twine, and not much more but the limits of our imaginations, we created a world </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">that thrilled us. </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">But today, kids spend most of their time playing computer games. Often they aren’t allowed the </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">luxury of thinking for themselves because typically in computer games, everything is already </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">outlined and predetermined for them.

<p>But we can capture that resourcefulness and vision in the lives of our kids, (and grasp it <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">again for ourselves, as parents and caregivers) particularly in the arena of theatre arts for </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">children.

<p><b>So Why Invest?</b></p>
<p>What’s that special in this concept of ours for yet another game for children? </p>
<p>For starters, the project is unique in its niche.  We don't copy existing games, and why would <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">we? Undoubtedly, it’s a brand new game that’s fresh, interesting, enjoyable, and sure to be a fun </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">and satisfying pastime highly sought after all over the world because it makes a child’s world he or </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">she would like it to be.

We are producers and directors. </span></p>
<p>We are actors and set designers.</p>
<p>As confirmed, self-admitted and unrepentant computer geeks and geniuses, we really love to <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">create interactive games, especially for kids, partly because we have never lost the wonder of our </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">own childhoods.

<p>They discover our world through using that genuine, untouched mind they started life with. That’s <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">why our goal is to create educational games which promote creativity; by doing so, it breeds </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">inventiveness and even giftedness—games that make them think, dream, create, concoct, and </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">construct something of their own, something that is uniquely theirs and unrepeatable.</span></p>
<p>We know that the Pocket Poppet game helps kids develop creative potential and awaken <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">their natural aptitude.

</div></div>","How this idea appeared
 
Remember the magical world of childhood, when everything was so big and fascinating to us,how charmed and enthralled we were by everything? Yet, in growing up, we lost some of that enchantment, where everything back then was so simple and yet a miracle. Using paste and glue, scissors and twine, and not much more but the limits of our imaginations, we created a world that thrilled us. 
But today, kids spend most of their time playing computer games. Often they aren’t allowed the luxury of thinking for themselves because typically in computer games, everything is already outlined and predetermined for them. Everything has been thought out and conceived for them with little possibility of their own creativity and self-expression. Clearly, in the context of today’s computer games it restricts childhood flights of fancy and the possibility of self-expression.
But we can capture that resourcefulness and vision in the lives of our kids, (and grasp it again for ourselves, as parents and caregivers) particularly in the arena of theatre arts for children. Think back and try to remember putting on a play or theatrical event. It was live theater worthy of a Globus stage, with fanciful twists in plot and unexpected finales—and it was great fun. 
Then let’s start reclaiming the inspiration and inventiveness that is inherent in youth and enrich the lives of our kids by introducing you to. . .




   What We Need & What You Get Announced budget will be used for Basic version . It includes:

Features:

Game for 2 platforms: iOS and Android
Allocating the items on the stage (background, stage sets, characters)

Customization of the characters.
Supporting various emotions of the characters.
Changing of animation settings (frames number, speed).
Adding own background music.
Recording of the voice and mixing it with video.
Implementation of game economy model (experience, levels, achievements, rewards).
Export the animation into video file
Creating own themes
Improving Store (support loading the list of themes and themes by themselves via network)
Creating the Frame animation
Supporting the particle effects
Supporting 3D objects


What is Pocket Poppet 

Just what is Pocket Poppet? It’s a game, sure, but it’s not just a game! It’s a hands-on, interactive and creative workshop where kids (including grown-up kids) can plunge into the extraordinary world of theater. In it, there are simple tools to use for, and in this imaginative theatre-game, and by using these tools, kids can invent and apply their own themed scenarios all by themselves. 
With Pocket Poppet tools they can:
• Create and write their own scenes/storyline by choice of theme.
• Decorate the stage.
• Choose the costumes for their characters
• Record the animated play and show it to their friends and family
And what is more, they can determine who and what their characters are, the scripts, set designs, props, themes (i.e., Christmas, Halloween, summer fun, winter games, Independence Day, etc.), lighting, background music, and costumes; thereby creating their own little masterpieces.
They can choose to be the wardrobe master, the scenarist/writer, director, lead actor, supporting actor, and producer! They might produce a show/scenario with their friends or family—and what could be more fun than co-creating and playing a theatre-game with our kids? What’s even more fun is that with Pocket Poppet there are no winners or losers—just satisfaction and enjoyment through an exciting, creative process of living theatre, whether collaboratively or independently.



  
So Why Invest?
What’s that special in this concept of ours for yet another game for children? 
For starters, the project is unique in its niche.  We don't copy existing games, and why would we? Undoubtedly, it’s a brand new game that’s fresh, interesting, enjoyable, and sure to be a fun and satisfying pastime highly sought after all over the world because it makes a child’s world he or she would like it to be. Kids can then further imagine wonderful new worlds full of adventures and secrets where they can dream and say: We are scenarists. We are producers and directors. 
We are actors and set designers.
As confirmed, self-admitted and unrepentant computer geeks and geniuses, we really love to create interactive games, especially for kids, partly because we have never lost the wonder of our own childhoods. We know that children study and learn by playing intellect-broadening games. 
They discover our world through using that genuine, untouched mind they started life with. That’s why our goal is to create educational games which promote creativity; by doing so, it breeds inventiveness and even giftedness—games that make them think, dream, create, concoct, and construct something of their own, something that is uniquely theirs and unrepeatable.
We know that the Pocket Poppet game helps kids develop creative potential and awaken their natural aptitude. Just imagine: you will be involved with a project that has the potential of launching the next Shakespeare or Spielberg to the world. To make this happen, we want to be in a stable and durable position to hire the finest designers, IT developers, writers, artists and musicians to ensure the highest-quality and user-friendly product is ready for the novice and sophisticated marketplace of users. In acquiring the best and talented resources for these needs, we can position and then establish Pocket Poppet to enhance and expand our own project initiatives and future productivity.

<p>DUAL GEAR is the 6 meters humanoid vehicle for military tactical developed side by side with astronaut robotic technology from  the biggest worldwide cooperation of space development organization to built the orbital energy station ""Gaia Belt""(also known as the Gaia Belt project). Trinity Element(TEC), the company associated with the most powerful government produced the first dual gears squad for space orbital defend (Call Orbital Gear at the first) until Gaia Belt was attacked by unidentified terrorist. TEC make the decision to deploy the Orbital Gear squad to intercept the terrorist. Despite their impressive effort, the Gaia Belt is heavily damaged. After the incident, the Orbital Gear evolved into Dual Gear, a surface tactical unit. TEC begin mass producing DG and sold them to the client worldwide, including the PMC.</p>

<p>The attack system of DUAL GEAR is a mixed of real-time shooting and quick performance(skill, etc) cut scene. </p>
<p>The game uses a system called Action Skill, which is a combined of two elements. First is the action point(AP), the other is the Generator Output(GP). Every skill will have their own requirement to activate.</p>
<p>for example, the weapon that has huge damage output or ability to hit multiple targets will need 1 or 2 action point and a lot of GP to activate.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453437475/kythixa7gic3xbnktt7j.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Like basic classic TBS game, the combat system included the range and percentage accuracy. Both are related with pilot status and any weapon equipped. Skill may have an effect on them too, increasing or decreasing the accuracy, making more damage or have more chance to get a critical hit. </p>
<p><b>Turn by turn and unit by unit </b></p>
<p>From the third-person perspective gameplay, the important of the system is how to order multiple units in the squad. The game limited the of the movement and attack  by GP gauge and action point. While the unit is moving, the enemy within range will attack the player unit. The attacking will stop when player mech stops moving,  this opens the player to plan out a strategy.  Should we attack another enemy or move to the new position again before changing the unit or ending turn. This system made squad and resource management extremely important.</p>
<p><b>Weapons </b></p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7ce486_70bb85afa9f04a0ba7253e776cf67878~mv2.gif"" src=""""/> <b> </b><p> </p>
<p>All skill come from the weapon. The player will get the skill from any weapon equipped, which can easily be assign into the skill wheel.  As the pilot become more experience, they will unlock new skills. All DG unit have a capacity to attach 4+1 weapon included L arm ,R arm, L shoulder, R shoulder and plus with some backpack have a weapon built in. Try out the Pre-Apha demo if you want to know how any weapon work!</p>

<p><b>Damage System</b></p>
<p>DUAL GEAR has a durability system set by AP&amp;CP gauge. AP gauge is Armor Power. This is the durability of outer armor. CP gauge is Core Power. it's mean the durability gauge of the inner frame. AP is the first protection before CP when AP is 0, Outer armor will be destroyed. After that the part will have only CP to received damage. The parts will be destroyed when the CP are depleted.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453437676/uhzonqfdx0xlldeixckd.png"" src=""""/></p>All part and armor are destroyable. When they do, they will have several effect to the unit to the unit. For Example, when the mech lost a right arm, you will also lose the ability to use the weapon on that arm. If the leg has taken a lot of damage, the movement will be slow and consume more GP than normal.<p><b>Hangar System</b></p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7ce486_824de36d7082422ca233c6028ae94b15~mv2.gif"" src=""""/><p>Hangar mode is the command center of your mech squad. Upgrade &amp; Build your squad, custom your unit, mission briefing, and find the secret story from here. The hangar will evolve (DG part in store, mission quest or etc) depend on your location of the mother base (there are several scatter around the world).  Let see the detail  below about this game mode.</p>
<p><b>Mech Customization </b></p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7ce486_91a37fe1bde04ef3aaced67612f83760~mv2.gif"" src=""""/><p> </p>
<p>DUAL GEAR let the  player custom their own mech and team. Every DG is composed of five main parts, The Main Camera(Head), Cockpit, Arms, Legs and Back Pack. Each part have unique initial status and role in the game. As an example, the high weight Legs have a higher durability and resistant value. However, it will slow the DG movement down and use a lot of GP when that mech move.</p>
<p>See the how to coloring your DG!</p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7ce486_c3c4ef7cf2734cf593ea8fe38540a814~mv2.gif"" src=""""/><br/><br/>The player can custom the color, add pattern and camouflage of the DG part by part. Don't forget to choose your emblem and become the ace right now!<p> </p>
<p><b>Carrier System</b></p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7ce486_f1adc65012a2458eba9b14af3bd1c996~mv2.gif"" src=""""/><p>The carrier system  is very necessary for all mission, as it is the way the squad enters the battlefield. Some mission will need a land carrier like a big trailer, air carrier to enter the ocean battlefield or The orbital carrier  for the space battlefield. There will be at lease 10 type of the carrier player can choose from. Every carrier will have different stat and ability, DualGear capacity they can carry and even support fire abilities.</p>
<p><b>Mission System</b></p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7ce486_45bd0633eea14115b6fb81410408981d~mv2.gif"" src=""""/>
</div>
<br/>The game encouraged the player to discover and unlock mission around the world.<div>Every mission will be replayable, in order to discover new part, secret intel, and hidden story line. The player can also set a handicap for the mission for higher rewards and EXP.<br/><br/><b>Pilot Recruit System</b><br/>As a commander of one of the PMC, it is crucial on recruiting pilot. Through the command center around the world, you can recruit experienced and skillful pilot. Every pilot can gain EXP and LV up, gaining skills and abilities as well. The better your pilot is, the stronger your squad become. <br/><br/><b>Tactical Negotiation System</b><br/>This is one of the ideas we are planning to add in the future. When the enemy unit surrendered and is in the white flag condition. The play will be able to attempt to recruit them into your pilot. There will also be chances of getting new parts from negotiation too. The negotiation is counted as Action Skill.<br/><br/><b>Dual Drive (Deva Drive or CSD)</b><br/>The system helped the pilot to control the DG. The DD, a device base on quantum computing, worked directly with pilot conscious. The process 90% mapped the human brain, allowing the pilot to be more efficient with the DualGear. This system is related to the chain combination attack that we will release more detail soon.</div>

<p>DUAL GEAR is set in  2064, The new beginning of space innovation. The new energy source was discovered in space.  Most powerful nations of the world and various astronautic organization integration to build the largest structure on the earth orbit call Gaia Belt, the photon&amp;microwave energy receiver station from the moon power plant. </p>
<p>Gaia Belt project affect the astronautic robotic technology greatly, hasten the development of the astronautic development. 2101, the first phase of Gaia Belt is completed and the testing of the microwave receiver begun. Then an unidentified terrorist attack the station. Despite a heroic attempt of the Orbital Gear squad to intercept the attack, the station was heavily damaged. The attack destroys part of the station, causing it an explosion. The explosion causes a chain reaction, destroying several other orbital structures and falling into Earth. The incident leaves behind ruin atmosphere and severe destructive outcome on Earth. The world would need 100 years to recover from this incident.</p>
<p>TEC blame the other organization as being too weak and force them out of the space program. They leave the astronautic development behind and turn to focus on more militaristic development instead.</p>
<p>DUAL GEAR is the result of the Gaia Belt incident. TEC began selling the war machines to military around the world.</p>

<p><strong>Questions about Become The Ace and Beginning of ACE perks.</strong></p>
<p>We got a lot of question about the perks to let you become an original pilot in the game. Let check about its below!</p>
<p>Q: When and Where my pilot image will appear in the game.<br/>A: Pilot image will show on Battle Situation Also, face expression module depend on any situation and have dynamic dialog(Text)</p>
<p>Q: My pilot will have a voice over?<br/>A: We have a basic Voice Over for all recruitable pilot or enemies pilot (Example Arrgg!, Nooo!, Taisho! and more.) Also, you can choose for male or female voice.</p>
<p>Q: Have an epic cut scene like SRW game ?.<br/>A: Oh! That is also my dream, but we don't have this module. We were focusing on mech cutscene like Armored Core and overlay with a 2D pilot UI box when they were talking, but only for a story character. So maybe add something special for a backer pilot! (You can share your idea!)</p>
<p>Q: Where is a biography of my pilot appears in the game?<br/>A: There are in a recruit pilot module(Hangar Manager), We deciding about how it was working on this module. So we can talk a little about it, that like you use your device to contact people!</p>
<p>Q: How Different about Beginning of ACE and Become The ACE?<br/>A: There are different by Digital and Physical reward type. The Beginning of ACE is only for digital rewards with ""draw your pilot image to the game."" So Become The Ace is preferred for physical reward. Backer also, receive a printed version of your pilot including in your game box!</p>
<p>Q: This game have any pre-made protagonist and main characters in pilots?<br/>A: Yes, But we need a bit of time before deploying an info about that. So all backer who's backed for ACE perks will get our document about the story, character, and fact of DUAL GEAR world before start talking for backer-pilot create.</p>
<p>Q: If I want my pilot to be a humanoid or android It's possible to do?<br/>A: Yes! Sure this is freely for your idea. But we do not prefer about if you want to use a licensed character from anywhere( Also you're Emblem Idea does not bring direct from any licensing graphic)</p>

Example, speed change when to transform to vehicle mode or be able to use unique skills attack the enemies. We plan for three different type of ""TDG"" Track Type, Hover Type, and Heli Type. If we can reach this stretch goal, we have more reward for all backer on the 1st and 2nd campaign. You can choose one of three ""TDG"" put to your hangar!</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are a small studio with little budget. We run the studio with a little outsource work and separated some of that income into developing Dual Gear. The challenge is that we need to create this game at the highest of quality we can make. </p>
<p> If we raise enough fund, we can improve the performance and graphic of this game. We would have a more complete sound dialogue, cutscene, and narrative script. This also allows us to developed this game for all console at the same time. Even if did not reach the initial goal,  we would still continue the development until the finish. Thank you all in the campaign and try out our pre-alpha demo!</p>

First Gigantic Mech Boss TRINITY GEAR!

*TRINITY GEAR is a robotic vehicle with double DUAL DRIVE devices! Produced with very large size compare to other DUAL GEAR! Equipped with massive and heavy weapon!
About DUAL GEAR Mech!
DUAL GEAR is the 6 meters humanoid vehicle for military tactical developed side by side with astronaut robotic technology from  the biggest worldwide cooperation of space development organization to built the orbital energy station ""Gaia Belt""(also known as the Gaia Belt project). Trinity Element(TEC), the company associated with the most powerful government produced the first dual gears squad for space orbital defend (Call Orbital Gear at the first) until Gaia Belt was attacked by unidentified terrorist. TEC make the decision to deploy the Orbital Gear squad to intercept the terrorist. Despite their impressive effort, the Gaia Belt is heavily damaged. After the incident, the Orbital Gear evolved into Dual Gear, a surface tactical unit. TEC begin mass producing DG and sold them to the client worldwide, including the PMC.


Movement SystemDual Gear used original movement inspired from Japanese mecha Anime. Several movement will remind you of several classic Japanese Mecha Anime.

The game uses GP gauge as the energy for the mech to move.  movement such as the regular move to location, dash and boost will consume the GP gauge. When depleted, the unit won't be able to move anymore that turn. Combat System


The attack system of DUAL GEAR is a mixed of real-time shooting and quick performance(skill, etc) cut scene. 
The game uses a system called Action Skill, which is a combined of two elements. First is the action point(AP), the other is the Generator Output(GP). Every skill will have their own requirement to activate.
for example, the weapon that has huge damage output or ability to hit multiple targets will need 1 or 2 action point and a lot of GP to activate.

Like basic classic TBS game, the combat system included the range and percentage accuracy. Both are related with pilot status and any weapon equipped. Skill may have an effect on them too, increasing or decreasing the accuracy, making more damage or have more chance to get a critical hit. 
Turn by turn and unit by unit 
From the third-person perspective gameplay, the important of the system is how to order multiple units in the squad. The game limited the of the movement and attack  by GP gauge and action point. While the unit is moving, the enemy within range will attack the player unit. The attacking will stop when player mech stops moving,  this opens the player to plan out a strategy.  Should we attack another enemy or move to the new position again before changing the unit or ending turn. This system made squad and resource management extremely important.
Weapons 
   
All skill come from the weapon. The player will get the skill from any weapon equipped, which can easily be assign into the skill wheel.  As the pilot become more experience, they will unlock new skills. All DG unit have a capacity to attach 4+1 weapon included L arm ,R arm, L shoulder, R shoulder and plus with some backpack have a weapon built in. Try out the Pre-Apha demo if you want to know how any weapon work!
See how to equip skills !

Example ingame weapons.





Damage System
DUAL GEAR has a durability system set by AP&CP gauge. AP gauge is Armor Power. This is the durability of outer armor. CP gauge is Core Power. it's mean the durability gauge of the inner frame. AP is the first protection before CP when AP is 0, Outer armor will be destroyed. After that the part will have only CP to received damage. The parts will be destroyed when the CP are depleted.
All part and armor are destroyable. When they do, they will have several effect to the unit to the unit. For Example, when the mech lost a right arm, you will also lose the ability to use the weapon on that arm. If the leg has taken a lot of damage, the movement will be slow and consume more GP than normal.Hangar System Hangar mode is the command center of your mech squad. Upgrade & Build your squad, custom your unit, mission briefing, and find the secret story from here. The hangar will evolve (DG part in store, mission quest or etc) depend on your location of the mother base (there are several scatter around the world).  Let see the detail  below about this game mode.
Mech Customization   
DUAL GEAR let the  player custom their own mech and team. Every DG is composed of five main parts, The Main Camera(Head), Cockpit, Arms, Legs and Back Pack. Each part have unique initial status and role in the game. As an example, the high weight Legs have a higher durability and resistant value. However, it will slow the DG movement down and use a lot of GP when that mech move.
See the how to coloring your DG! The player can custom the color, add pattern and camouflage of the DG part by part. Don't forget to choose your emblem and become the ace right now! 
Carrier System The carrier system  is very necessary for all mission, as it is the way the squad enters the battlefield. Some mission will need a land carrier like a big trailer, air carrier to enter the ocean battlefield or The orbital carrier  for the space battlefield. There will be at lease 10 type of the carrier player can choose from. Every carrier will have different stat and ability, DualGear capacity they can carry and even support fire abilities.
Mission System 

The game encouraged the player to discover and unlock mission around the world.Every mission will be replayable, in order to discover new part, secret intel, and hidden story line. The player can also set a handicap for the mission for higher rewards and EXP.Pilot Recruit SystemAs a commander of one of the PMC, it is crucial on recruiting pilot. Through the command center around the world, you can recruit experienced and skillful pilot. Every pilot can gain EXP and LV up, gaining skills and abilities as well. The better your pilot is, the stronger your squad become. Tactical Negotiation SystemThis is one of the ideas we are planning to add in the future. When the enemy unit surrendered and is in the white flag condition. The play will be able to attempt to recruit them into your pilot. There will also be chances of getting new parts from negotiation too. The negotiation is counted as Action Skill.Dual Drive (Deva Drive or CSD)The system helped the pilot to control the DG. The DD, a device base on quantum computing, worked directly with pilot conscious. The process 90% mapped the human brain, allowing the pilot to be more efficient with the DualGear. This system is related to the chain combination attack that we will release more detail soon.

Story
DUAL GEAR is set in  2064, The new beginning of space innovation. The new energy source was discovered in space.  Most powerful nations of the world and various astronautic organization integration to build the largest structure on the earth orbit call Gaia Belt, the photon&microwave energy receiver station from the moon power plant. 
Gaia Belt project affect the astronautic robotic technology greatly, hasten the development of the astronautic development. 2101, the first phase of Gaia Belt is completed and the testing of the microwave receiver begun. Then an unidentified terrorist attack the station. Despite a heroic attempt of the Orbital Gear squad to intercept the attack, the station was heavily damaged. The attack destroys part of the station, causing it an explosion. The explosion causes a chain reaction, destroying several other orbital structures and falling into Earth. The incident leaves behind ruin atmosphere and severe destructive outcome on Earth. The world would need 100 years to recover from this incident.
TEC blame the other organization as being too weak and force them out of the space program. They leave the astronautic development behind and turn to focus on more militaristic development instead.
DUAL GEAR is the result of the Gaia Belt incident. TEC began selling the war machines to military around the world.

Q: Have an epic cut scene like SRW game ?.A: Oh! That is also my dream, but we don't have this module. We were focusing on mech cutscene like Armored Core and overlay with a 2D pilot UI box when they were talking, but only for a story character. So maybe add something special for a backer pilot! (You can share your idea!)
Q: Where is a biography of my pilot appears in the game?A: There are in a recruit pilot module(Hangar Manager), We deciding about how it was working on this module. So we can talk a little about it, that like you use your device to contact people!

Risks & Challenges
We are a small studio with little budget. We run the studio with a little outsource work and separated some of that income into developing Dual Gear. The challenge is that we need to create this game at the highest of quality we can make. 
 If we raise enough fund, we can improve the performance and graphic of this game. We would have a more complete sound dialogue, cutscene, and narrative script. This also allows us to developed this game for all console at the same time. Even if did not reach the initial goal,  we would still continue the development until the finish. Thank you all in the campaign and try out our pre-alpha demo!

<p style=""text-align: center;""><br/><strong>Who are We?</strong><br/>Meet the Power:ON team - Marcin<strong>*</strong> (25.) and Mateusz<strong>**</strong> (22.). </p>
<p><strong> *</strong> Marcin - He remembers. Everything. He was at the fall of the republic, and rise of the empire... Oh, sorry it's a different story. Marcins very first own PC had Pentium 166Mhz, video card with 2Mb of memory, and whole 100Mb HDD. He is designer, writer and gamer. <br/>Today, he's favourite title to play is Star Wars Jedi Academy ( 2003' ) mod called Movie Battles II - which he wishes to feedback in future.</p>
<p><strong>**</strong> Mateusz - Man living in 4D, which makes him a great 3D artist. Amount of matters, He's able to deal at once, is stunning and impressive. He's an NBA and NHL enthusiast with an aspiration, to release someday his own PC game... with splitscreen and coop for sure ( well, Contra changes people minds and hearts ). Rare moments, of rest and relaxation, are sacrificed in order to keep alive His alter ego - Native Polish Online Coach. :) Constantly trying to keep calm and stay open-minded. </p>
<p><strong>We are gamers!</strong><br/>  We both studied IT, as our primary goal was to connect our passion with possible future job. Despite of achiving IT Technican degree, We had no luck in finding a decent job. Our goal was outside of reach, untill this very moment. What happened? E-sports!</p>
<p><strong>World of competition.</strong><br/>  It would be a lie to say that E-sports were not existing before LoL. There were a stupendous amounts of people intrested in CS stage. Even more played Starcraft on serious tournaments. As long as ""multiplayer""existed, there were constant battles fought to reach out the limits of one's inner skill. But... with League of Legends, and its devTeam which put so much efforts into organizing great shows, E-sports became a thing. And today there's none denying that It's counted among real sports.</p>
<p>  A few years passed... Scale of tournaments has grown, due to increased number of players online. Every single day they are fighting, with hope that someday They could prove their abilities, and become champions! But, there are many obstacles on their way to the Top.<br/>First, and main, is the need to reach the top of many labels build in game. To do that, not only skill will be essential, but also a great amount of time, and small amount of luck. Without spending hours ""in-game"" there is small possibility to reach the TOP. Even if your skill was at GodLike mode, a few ""unlucky"" dissconnects could erase all Your progress - or even get You banned. Despite of that, a need to sacrifice a lot of time, in order to get anywhere, is for some a true ""firewall"". That's why we want to step in and change couple of issues.</p>
<p><strong>Serious! Gaming House.</strong><br/>  Our primary goal is to create our own E-sports League, based on playing all-the-way-to-the-Top via LAN matches.

Tournaments calendars will be displayed not later, than one week before event start. With most titles (example: LoL, DOTA2, CS:Go) we plan to run two-part seasons ( Summer/Winter editions ) and atleast one additional single-time event, each year.<br/>If that form of E-sports will be a success, we plan to continuously open more Gaming Houses in Poland, so we could form a coutry-wide infrastructure, unlocking Worlds first real E-sports championships.</p>

<p>  <strong>I.</strong> YouTube Video channel for gamers - providing gameplays, reviews, tutorials. It's quite obvious choice in current times, and almost a ""must-have"" for a company like ours. By posting recent matches, tips, and shorts with best players, It's a powerful tool to promote local Players. </p>
<p><strong>II.</strong> Mateusz is hunted by the spirit of unborn game. To get rid of it, we must create our own title. Already got perfect designers, and a bit of volonteers for that job. Skills in UE4 are here aswell.</p>
<p><strong>III.</strong> For now we are limited by our wallets, but in near future we would like to provide VR. Marcin always wanted a VR duel in MB2. Having a E-sport match in VR with some title (maybe For Honor) would be epic.</p>
<p><strong>IV.</strong> We are in possession of 3D printer, and we are not afraid to use it. Nope, we're not kidding.

Play Maguss! A premier AR wizarding mobile MMORPG. Cast spells on your smartphone or using the Maguss Wand! Walk to raid dungeons and collect ingredients, study to learn spells, brew potions and fight to earn respect and glory. While the world is a stage, you are the lead actor. The most crucial part of the game is the art of spell casting. Whether in combat or mixing potions, the result depends on you. The game is designed in a manner which allows players to play with or without a wand. We have prepared an interesting gameplay for both.However, having one has some cool benefits. For example, while using the Wand players gain extra experience for every successful spell they cast.  Once there were many of them. Now there are few. Wizards. Watchmen of the balance in the world. The time has come to revive the old tradition. Unite again!At the start of the game, you can join one of the 4 Orders. Each one of them follows a different ideology and has its own unique characteristics. Pick one you like the most, earn Order points and reach the top of the rankings. Orders offer many benefits including shop where you can buy items for Order points, access to the Order specific spells and, most importantly, an opportunity to find friendship and fun.Duel with others, whether from the comfort of your home or face-to-face! The game offers two PvP modes.1. Long-distance mode2. Proximity modeDo it the old-fashion way! Turn on the battle mode and challenge nearby players by tapping his/her icon on the map. Wait for the duel invitation to get accepted and fight in person.The fighting system is a combination of tactics and anticipation. 


Offensive SpellsThese are mostly harmful and are honed to bring pain on those targeted. 



Defensive SpellsDefensive magic is all about maintaining safety by absorbing, negating, blocking and redirecting harmful effects. 



Utility SpellsSpells that are commonly used by wizards and witches to aid them in everyday tasks such as mixing potions, opening doors and unlocking treasure chests. 



Summoning SpellsUnique spells that call forth loyal monster servants to aid a witch or wizard in battle. Summoned monsters are temporary and less powerful than tamed creatures.



CharmsBeneficial effects and self-improving buffs fall within the 'Charms' category. These helpers can mend wounds, provide insight and grant resilience against some of the most harmful magical effects.



CursesThe nastiest of spells fall within this category, those used to bring more harm, paralyse and even rob the opponent of spellcasting ability are named like that for a good reason.

 The world around has lot to offer. Don’t miss it! A great story might be right around the corner.See the world from a different perspective. Scan the area around you for hidden ingredients and creatures. Be the first to discover new species and unveil secret locations. The game is full of characters inspired by various fantasy stories, cultures and tales. Some of them are welcomed by humans while others are of no use and have to be dealt with. Become a fearsome slaymaster or a mystic whisperer. Monsters come in all shapes and sizes. The bigger they are the nastier they get. Expect to meet anything from delicate Pixies to earth-shaking Trolls. 

The world is in danger. What was once safely locked, has broken out. The darkness is about to return and there is only one way to stop it. Fight the Underworld. Only the bravest few would ever dare to go there. The fewer would expect to return.
To get into the Underworld and explore its numerous dungeons look for the relevant icon on the map. After you find one, you will have to cast a series of specific glyphs that are displayed on the dungeon doors.

<p>Below is an example of how a typical scenario could play out.</p>
<p>Example 1 - Scenario 1 </p>
<ul>
<li>A Pro would like to enter a $20 (online) tournament with 180 entrants.</li>
<li>The total prize pool for this tournament is $3600, the first place prize is $1080, the minimum cash prize is $23.40 for coming 27th. If the Pro is eliminated from the tournament between places 180-28th they get nothing and the backer looses their $20 investment.</li>
<li>The pro registers this tournament which displays on our platform, Backer (A) decides to back the pro for this tournament and makes the payment (it goes through our payment solution and automatically buys-in the pro to the tournament).</li>
<li>The Pro plays the tournament which could last around 5-6 hours, backer (A) is free to carry on with their day. </li>
<li>The Pro is doing well, there is now 90 entrants left out of the original 180, and the pro has an average chip stack.</li>
<li>Backer (A) thinks this as a good position to exit, and puts the option back on to our platform for $45.</li>
<li>Backer (B) likes this position because he/she is not buying the position from the beginning and likes the pros chances now, and so buys the position.</li>
<li>Backer (A) has cashed out their position making a small profit of $25, knowing that the Pro could have gone-on to win the tournament but also that he could have been eliminated before the 27th place.</li>
<li>The Pro goes-on to cash in the tournament and comes 4th, the payout is $266.40. The payout automatically goes into both their accounts and splits 50-50 which comes to $133.20 each.</li>
<li>Backer (B) makes a profit of $88.20. The Pro makes $133.20 for their time and effort.</li>
<li>They are all free to repeat the process as many times a day as they like.</li>

</div></div>","What we're all about 

     
BackthePros.com was developed with a simple goal.. getting everyday poker players who might be sitting idly-by without the funds, to get up-and-start-playing for free. 

We are in mid-development and will be launching in October
Pre-register now from $20.. get backed for live and online poker tournaments for one year, or $60 for a lifetime.  
Get backed in real-time, register for a live or online tournament, which will display on our platform.. and get instantly backed. Any winnings get split between you and the backer and paid automatically in both accounts. 
Backers can trade their position back onto our platform at any time.
We are raising funds to complete our MVP and launch the platform in October. 

Pros are motivated to try their best to win as all their history is available to future backers. Generally, the better Pros do the more likely they are to get backed again and again.
                                 
 
Our aim will always be to get poker players playing without risking their own money and provide a sustainable infrastructure. We will never charge commission on winnings, and will also provide a rake free playing option. We only charge a small yearly fee which would allow us to keep the site running and build a global community of backer. The more backers we have the better it is for the players.   
 
How it works.

Below is an example of how a typical scenario could play out.
Example 1 - Scenario 1 

A Pro would like to enter a $20 (online) tournament with 180 entrants.
The total prize pool for this tournament is $3600, the first place prize is $1080, the minimum cash prize is $23.40 for coming 27th. If the Pro is eliminated from the tournament between places 180-28th they get nothing and the backer looses their $20 investment.
The pro registers this tournament which displays on our platform, Backer (A) decides to back the pro for this tournament and makes the payment (it goes through our payment solution and automatically buys-in the pro to the tournament).
The Pro plays the tournament which could last around 5-6 hours, backer (A) is free to carry on with their day. 
The Pro is doing well, there is now 90 entrants left out of the original 180, and the pro has an average chip stack.
Backer (A) thinks this as a good position to exit, and puts the option back on to our platform for $45.
Backer (B) likes this position because he/she is not buying the position from the beginning and likes the pros chances now, and so buys the position.
Backer (A) has cashed out their position making a small profit of $25, knowing that the Pro could have gone-on to win the tournament but also that he could have been eliminated before the 27th place.
The Pro goes-on to cash in the tournament and comes 4th, the payout is $266.40. The payout automatically goes into both their accounts and splits 50-50 which comes to $133.20 each.
Backer (B) makes a profit of $88.20. The Pro makes $133.20 for their time and effort.
They are all free to repeat the process as many times a day as they like.

<h3>The Game Olive Garden Doesn't Want You to Play</h3>
<p>Did you know the federal minimum wage for tipped workers is only $2.13 per hour? Servers at restaurants like Olive Garden, Longhorn Steakhouse, and Capitol Grill often work without paid sick leave or any opportunities for advancement. The restaurant industry is the fastest-growing segment of US economy, with almost 11 million workers; yet it's also the absolute lowest paying employer — the minimum wage for tipped workers has been stuck at $2.13 for the last 23 years.</p>
<h3>Where Does TopServer Come In?</h3>
<p>Millions of people in the restaurant industry deserve better; to move up to a fine dining job that pays a living wage. That's why we’ve created a fun, mobile app game-based training program called TopServer, designed to bring our renowned restaurant training programs to mobile phones nationwide. We've worked with top developers and restaurants to develop our beta version and we're ready to go live! </p>

<li>Master the nine principles of hospitality<br/>
</li>
<li>Advance through five challenging levels of service toward a fair-wage, fine dining job.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Where You Come In</h3>
We have gotten incredible start-up support from The Workers Lab, worked with an award-winning team on game development and design, and have built a beta version of TopServer ready for you to try out!  Be part of our team as we move from beta to a full release by helping us to raise the $20,000 we need for this next phase.

<p>This first version of the game is complete, and we want to invite you to get in on the ground floor and tell us what you think. What should we keep in mind as we make improvements and get it ready to reach millions of restaurant workers?</p>
<h3>What the Money Will Support</h3>
<p>We've put our hearts and souls into this early version of Top Server, but it is still a Beta version. That's where you can help! We want to go full 1.0, so we're counting on your backing to allow us to include possible features such as:</p>

The environments where all the game action happens are based on these 'High Road' restaurants. Check them out online and stop by for a bite to eat next time you’re in their city!
Thank You!Thank you so very much! We appreciate your support in getting this project off the ground and are so glad to have you join us on the ground floor. Together we can make this happen.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

I think that the time is right for a game that focuses on creative approaches to city living. Players can design residential areas with parks, museums, schools and retail centers. They can build industrial centers,  office complexes and farms. All of this is connected by roads, and highways.</p><p>Over the past year, I’ve developed a city builder with a traffic simulation and customizable 3D rendered buildings. In the past few months I’ve fully implemented “The Prosperity System” which will define the game: it’s a dynamic economic model where neighborhoods thrive or fail based on access to work, shopping, parks, and schools.</p><p>The game is based around six “heatmaps.” The heatmaps are Pollution, Crime, Education, Prosperity, Value, and Density. Essentially, Education (plus a good road system) creates Prosperity, Prosperity (among other things) creates Value, and Value (plus Prosperity) creates Density. However, Density creates Crime and Pollution, which have a negative impact on Prosperity and Value, creating a negative feedback loop. Negative feedback loops are important to me, since they counteract the explosive nature of positive feedback loops which turn many simulation games into sandboxes.</p><p>As a player, you have two options. You can buy very expensive city services (schools, parks, police stations, etc) to cut through the negative feedback loop. Alternately, you can build a broad, flat, suburban city, with the intention to grow a dense city center later in the game. I call these two approaches “San Francisco vs Los Angeles.” I consider this to be a kind of morality system, creating the opportunity for different play-styles and different cities.</p><p>In this game, a city doesn’t grow linearly. Instead, the community behaves like a living organism, emerging out of chaos and always at risk of dying. You’ll have to shepherd your city through randomized recessions in the national economy as well as the consequences of any blunders you make. It will be a unique game compared with other city builders, with a more vulnerable budget maintaining a fundamentally unstable economic system.</p><h3> </h3><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>I need you to join our campaign with a donation that supports a closed alpha test for a few months prior to the launch of Early Access on Steam.</p><p>You get a set of rewards based on your contribution.
