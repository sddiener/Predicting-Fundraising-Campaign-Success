<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>My name is Shawndria McCoy and I am a North Carolina native (yes, an east coast girl).  My passion is and has always been in the fashion accessory industry, in particular shoes.  It's been a dream for the past 8 years to start my own shoe line, but not just any shoe line.  I have struggled all of my life, even when I was a young girl, finding shoes that fit my feet comfortably.  I was in middle school wearing a size 11 and by college I had grown to a size 13.  Shoes of that size were very hard to find and when I did find them, I was only able to wear them for a short time before they started hurting....BADLY!  All women want to have shoes that they can wear all the time without any discomfort.  Who wants to have to take several pairs of shoes with them daily to accommodate for their mobility or work or other activities?  No one.  It is my desire and vision of Esemelle Shoes to create shoes for women who, like me, have challenges finding shoes in larger sizes that fit their feet comfortably.  Esemelle's staple is ""Comfortability, Affordability, Accessibility, all with a Chic Look"".</p>
<p>It is the long-term goal and vision of Esemelle Shoes to give back to the community by providing shoes to the less advantaged population in the United States and abroad.  We understand the needs of women all over the world and there are women in other countries that do not have the means to obtain shoes that feet their feet.  We would like to ultimately donate a a wealth of shoes to these poverty stricken countries.  As a Contributor and Supporter of our brand, you will help us to achieve this goal and hopefully surpass it.  We all see the videos on television showing individuals in poverty stricken countries with no shoes on their feet.  When will we stop looking at these individuals and help them?  Helping is not an insurmountable task, but it does require funds to do it.  This is why Esemelle is so passionate about what it is doing and the visions and objectives it will accomplish.  However, we cannot do it without your support.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Esemelle Shoes is seeking at least $80,000 in funding, which will be used solely for the startup of the business.  Specifically, the funds will go towards the shoe design process, trademarks, manufacturing, branding and marketing, and hiring 1 employee.  As a Contributor, you will get to select a shoe from our first phase designs to have made in your size (for yourself or give as a gift to a deserving lady).  You will receive a 50% discount on your first shoe order (once the shoes are manufactured) and free standard shipping for all orders over $75.  In the event Esemelle Shoes does not raise the needed funds (our goal amount), all monies raised will go specifically to the design and manufacturing process only and the company will not hire any additional employees.  We can assure you that any funds raised, no matter how great or how small, will not be wasted or misused.  We manage our books professionally and consistently and will certainly be able to account for every penny we collect.  If at any time a Contributor has any question about any funds and how they are being used, we will gladly provide that information.</p>
<p>With our future goal of being able to donate shoes to the less advantaged populations around the globe, each Contributor will have their name, if they desire, in one shoe box which is donated so that the recipient will know that it was your support that provided those shoes for them.  This vision is not about Esemelle Shoes getting the credit...we just want to make other ladies happy while they strut their stuff.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Your Contribution is valuable because there is a market for this niche and Esemelle Shoes is confident it can and will meet this need.  We have done our research and we have talked to a host of women with this problem who are eagerly waiting and excited about our upcoming spring/summer 2019 debut of our new collection.  It does not end there though...just think of all of the ladies who are unable to purchase shoes or who do not have the means whom our future donation will help.  As a Contributor, whether male or female, you very well may know someone who has the same problem that I do with finding larger sized shoes.  Why not help me to help them?  You don't have to be of any particular gender, age, or sex to be a blessing to someone else.</p>
<p>We are not new to business.  I, the Founder, have built several other successful businesses and I am passionate about all I do.  My life mission has always been to help others and the visions of Esemelle Shoes are no less than.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The business faces threats of having someone market the same ideas before the business has met the requirements to apply for a trademark or other protections.  The challenges will include marketing to such a large international population and getting the word out to a large enough sector to promote a faster and more consistent profit.</p>
<p>Another risk the business will overcome is the decline in the U.S. economy.  Shoes are a discretionary purchase and online stores are heavily dependent on per capita disposable income and macroeconomic factors that drive consumer spending.  Our branding and intense marketing strategies will keep our shoes in demand.  Because this fashion accessory niche is heavily needed and much sought after, the business will be able to overcome this risk and drive sales consistently.</p>
<p>The product, its timing, potential competitors, and the spending habits of my potential customers are concerns the business must account for and overcome.  The product must solve a problem to get consumers to invest.  Timing needs to address the market at the right time.  Competition from the big or well-known brands must be recognized as customers gravitate to what they are most familiar with.  To overcome this threat, I must recognize and focus on my value and what exactly I am bringing to the market. I must know and understand the buying trends of my potential customers.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand there are some who would like to contribute to our campaign and support our efforts, but right now that may not be a possibility for you.  No worries.  We totally understand.  You still have lots of talent you can contribute to help us make this campaign and business a success.  Help us spread the word about Esemelle by posting our campaign on your social media sites.  Let's make some noise!  Tell a friend, coworker, family member or neighbor about our campaign.  No assistance is too small.  We cannot do this alone.  You can also use Indiegogo's share tools located here on this page below.  That's all there is to it.  We greatly appreciate you and all of your support.</p>

Esemelle Shoes is seeking at least $80,000 in funding, which will be used solely for the startup of the business.  Specifically, the funds will go towards the shoe design process, trademarks, manufacturing, branding and marketing, and hiring 1 employee.  As a Contributor, you will get to select a shoe from our first phase designs to have made in your size (for yourself or give as a gift to a deserving lady).  You will receive a 50% discount on your first shoe order (once the shoes are manufactured) and free standard shipping for all orders over $75.  In the event Esemelle Shoes does not raise the needed funds (our goal amount), all monies raised will go specifically to the design and manufacturing process only and the company will not hire any additional employees.  We can assure you that any funds raised, no matter how great or how small, will not be wasted or misused.  We manage our books professionally and consistently and will certainly be able to account for every penny we collect.  If at any time a Contributor has any question about any funds and how they are being used, we will gladly provide that information.
With our future goal of being able to donate shoes to the less advantaged populations around the globe, each Contributor will have their name, if they desire, in one shoe box which is donated so that the recipient will know that it was your support that provided those shoes for them.  This vision is not about Esemelle Shoes getting the credit...we just want to make other ladies happy while they strut their stuff.
The Impact

Your Contribution is valuable because there is a market for this niche and Esemelle Shoes is confident it can and will meet this need.  We have done our research and we have talked to a host of women with this problem who are eagerly waiting and excited about our upcoming spring/summer 2019 debut of our new collection.  It does not end there though...just think of all of the ladies who are unable to purchase shoes or who do not have the means whom our future donation will help.  As a Contributor, whether male or female, you very well may know someone who has the same problem that I do with finding larger sized shoes.  Why not help me to help them?  You don't have to be of any particular gender, age, or sex to be a blessing to someone else.
We are not new to business.  I, the Founder, have built several other successful businesses and I am passionate about all I do.  My life mission has always been to help others and the visions of Esemelle Shoes are no less than.  

Risks & Challenges
The business faces threats of having someone market the same ideas before the business has met the requirements to apply for a trademark or other protections.  The challenges will include marketing to such a large international population and getting the word out to a large enough sector to promote a faster and more consistent profit.
Another risk the business will overcome is the decline in the U.S. economy.  Shoes are a discretionary purchase and online stores are heavily dependent on per capita disposable income and macroeconomic factors that drive consumer spending.  Our branding and intense marketing strategies will keep our shoes in demand.  Because this fashion accessory niche is heavily needed and much sought after, the business will be able to overcome this risk and drive sales consistently.
The product, its timing, potential competitors, and the spending habits of my potential customers are concerns the business must account for and overcome.  The product must solve a problem to get consumers to invest.  Timing needs to address the market at the right time.  Competition from the big or well-known brands must be recognized as customers gravitate to what they are most familiar with.  To overcome this threat, I must recognize and focus on my value and what exactly I am bringing to the market. I must know and understand the buying trends of my potential customers.

Other Ways You Can Help
We understand there are some who would like to contribute to our campaign and support our efforts, but right now that may not be a possibility for you.  No worries.  We totally understand.  You still have lots of talent you can contribute to help us make this campaign and business a success.  Help us spread the word about Esemelle by posting our campaign on your social media sites.  Let's make some noise!  Tell a friend, coworker, family member or neighbor about our campaign.  No assistance is too small.  We cannot do this alone.  You can also use Indiegogo's share tools located here on this page below.  That's all there is to it.  We greatly appreciate you and all of your support.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Who we are?</h3>
<p>Margaux &amp; Camilla is a watch brand that chooses to compliment the creative side of who you are as an individual. We each shine in our own way and what better way to express that uniqueness than with a watch that exudes individuality just as much as you. Inspired by automotive luxury, we chose to incorporate the fine touches that we see in vehicles, such as alcantara, leather, and ambient lighting, to make a watch that sets itself apart from the rest. Meticulously crafted with elegant, high-quality materials, you will possess a well designed watch without having to break the bank.</p>
<p>So we invite you to choose your path</p>

<h3>The Classic</h3>

<p>The Classic brings two flavors that will add wonders to anyone that wears it. In La Rose &amp; Le Bordeaux you get two different but distinct looks. La Rose uses rose gold stainless steel with a subtle satin pink and cream as a combination that just melts together. Le Bordeaux on the other hand uses a striking satin burgundy and rose gold stainless steel to add a pop of color to your wrist.</p>

<p>We've chosen only the highest quality materials because you deserve nothing less. Our alcantara and leather come straight from Italy. We've also chosen to use Ronda Swiss movements in our classic watch and Swiss ISA movements in our chronograph as they are both trusted Swiss movements and work well over time.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise $60K in order for our project to get off the ground. The funds we raise will go into production costs to produce our first batch of watches and to invest into more unique watch designs for you. The more we raise the more we can create for you.</p>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p>For our Early Bird backers you will have a chance to purchase your Margaux &amp; Camilla watch of your choosing for 40%+ off the retail price. This Early Bird pricing is limited so get it before it sells out.</p>
<p>For our Regular Backers you will still have a chance to purchase your Margaux &amp; Camilla watch of your choosing for a percentage off the retail price. There are even bundled packages for even more savings just for you.</p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal then the funds will go back to you. We are in this for a fixed goal and with your help we can achieve it</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are many risks and challenges in achieving a goal such as this. That is why we have worked tirelessly with our manufacturers to make sure that everything that can go wrong is addressed. We factored in a buffer in case there are delays in manufacturing but we are assured that there will be none. If anything happens along the way good or bad we will notify you, our backers, every step of the way.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't purchase a perk we understand but we ask if you can please share this with your friends and family. We would love for you to be apart of this journey in any way you can.</p>
<p>This is just the start! We hope that you are as excited as we are to see these watches on your wrists!</p>

<p>In Indonesia, continuous news comes from doctors and medical personnel who treat patients with corona virus or Covid-19 . They were declared dead after being infected while having to deal with Covid-19 patients.</p>
<p>As of Saturday, (4/4/2020) there were 25 doctors who died while treating Covid-19 patients. The list is circulating among doctors and health workers.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1586096148/dsnsle0vqeopf92suwaw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) apparently can not be done haphazardly. Especially in handling corona virus or covid-19 which has become this pandemic.</p>
<p>It must be understood, this tool apparently can not be used again after being released or cannot be used repeatedly. Therefore, for medical personnel the use of Personal Protective Equipment must be fully utilized.</p>
<p>Because it is used only once, medical personnel, both doctors and nurses, must withstand their basic needs for food and drink. In addition, they also have to hold themselves to the toilet or to urinate or defecate.</p>
<p>In addition to the price that is quite expensive, the availability of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) that is rare now requires medical staff to make the most of this tool.</p>
<p>Our goal for the next five weeks is to get at least 3,000 standard urinal bag and mask equip with water bottle into the hands of medical workers as quickly and cheaply as possible to comfort the medical staff on duty.</p>

</div></div>","In Indonesia, continuous news comes from doctors and medical personnel who treat patients with corona virus or Covid-19 . They were declared dead after being infected while having to deal with Covid-19 patients.
As of Saturday, (4/4/2020) there were 25 doctors who died while treating Covid-19 patients. The list is circulating among doctors and health workers.

The use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) apparently can not be done haphazardly. Especially in handling corona virus or covid-19 which has become this pandemic.
It must be understood, this tool apparently can not be used again after being released or cannot be used repeatedly. Therefore, for medical personnel the use of Personal Protective Equipment must be fully utilized.
Because it is used only once, medical personnel, both doctors and nurses, must withstand their basic needs for food and drink. In addition, they also have to hold themselves to the toilet or to urinate or defecate.
In addition to the price that is quite expensive, the availability of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) that is rare now requires medical staff to make the most of this tool.
Our goal for the next five weeks is to get at least 3,000 standard urinal bag and mask equip with water bottle into the hands of medical workers as quickly and cheaply as possible to comfort the medical staff on duty.

The United Nations estimates that 1.6 billion currently live in substandard housing, and that number is rapidly growing. Creating an affordable, clean, and efficient housing option is one of the most important issues facing the world today. 




The vast supply of shipping containers around the world and the fact that they can easily be repurposed into homes means that homebuyers save big compared to traditional homes, with models starting at $25,000.








People that live in areas prone to natural disasters are prime candidates for the Jagpod. Shipping container homes handle a variety of disasters better than traditional homes: floods, fires, hurricanes, and earthquakes, just to name a few.




 We can do the majority of the work in building your home in our manufacturing facility, so the building process is dramatically faster than traditional homebuilding. New homes can be ready and fully furnished within 90 days.

Imagine a design custom to you


The Jagpod’s solar panels allow you to stop wasting money on your electric bill. Combined with the recycling of a shipping container, you have a home that is extremely eco-friendly and cost-effective. 




Housing affordability continues to decline as many households spend well over the recommended 30% of income on housing. Reducing housing costs allows families to spend money on other things like food, education, healthcare, or starting a business.

Container homes offer an affordable housing option


We want to offer an affordable to home to every family in the world, but we also understand that every homebuyer is unique. We can customize your home to match your family’s needs.

Jaguar will customize your Jagpod as basic or luxurious as you want


As housing costs continue to rise, the tiny home trend has really taken off in the past few years. Shipping container homes are a natural next step for the alternative housing market due to their affordability, safety, and eco-friendliness. 

Container homes are trending all over the globe.


With 100 million homeless across the globe, there is a huge need for affordable housing options for non-profits and government agencies. This is an opportunity for us to make a big impact and help alleviate a major societal problem.

In 1980, on a warm sunny day, on the  Canadian North Shores of Lake Superior, I was invited aboard Cousteau's ship, Calypso. Later, I invited the Cousteau crew to meet my family, especially my Dad as he was a renowned historian and Story -Teller.</i></p><p><i>          My Dad and I guided the Calypso crew to the exact location where the famous U.S. luxury yacht, Gunilda had sunk in 80 meters of water.

Jean-Michel Cousteau informed us that these Greenstones came from a region of Lake Superior that has no geological similarities like it anywhere else on Earth. I asked him to explain further and he simply said that these isolated islands here, on Lake Superior, are like a miniature version of the Gallopogus Islands that are known as having the World's rarest forms of plants, animals, and rock formation. He further noted that the geological formations where these Greenstones were found are totally different from that of the mainland that surrounds these unique islands.    The Cousteau Expedition decided to spend extra days researching this unusual remote geological phenomenon.                                                                       <strong>The Cousteau Society </strong>is world famous for its extensive research capabilities, so to watch their enthusiasm for these Greenstones was very impressive and I began at that very moment to realize that these Greenstones were incredibly rare.

He was very confident so he threw the green bottle ( message inside ) in the water and today that someone, me Eddie ""SAGE"", who found this bottle with the message in it, is still living a life of good luck.

In 1980, on a warm sunny day, on the  Canadian North Shores of Lake Superior, I was invited aboard Cousteau's ship, Calypso. Later, I invited the Cousteau crew to meet my family, especially my Dad as he was a renowned historian and Story -Teller.          My Dad and I guided the Calypso crew to the exact location where the famous U.S. luxury yacht, Gunilda had sunk in 80 meters of water. While visiting our home, the Cousteau family entertained us with their story-telling adventures and we told them our stories of life in the wilderness bush country. I showed them our Greenstone Collection and their faces were energized as they held these precious gems in their hands... Jean-Michel Cousteau informed us that these Greenstones came from a region of Lake Superior that has no geological similarities like it anywhere else on Earth. I asked him to explain further and he simply said that these isolated islands here, on Lake Superior, are like a miniature version of the Gallopogus Islands that are known as having the World's rarest forms of plants, animals, and rock formation. He further noted that the geological formations where these Greenstones were found are totally different from that of the mainland that surrounds these unique islands.    The Cousteau Expedition decided to spend extra days researching this unusual remote geological phenomenon.                                                                       The Cousteau Society is world famous for its extensive research capabilities, so to watch their enthusiasm for these Greenstones was very impressive and I began at that very moment to realize that these Greenstones were incredibly rare. My research later in life further validated this fact from organizations such as National Geographic. The Cousteau Society's ship ""CALYPSO""  ""Prepare-for-DIVE""  by Submersible on Canada's Lake Superior to explore the U.S.A. Luxury Yacht "" Gunilda"".  It sunk May 11, 1911, to a depth of 80 meters in Northern Canada after running aground in one meter of water. The U.S. marine maps did not indicate this shallow water area, that was located in the middle of a deep channel, so the luxury yacht ran completely on top of it and when the salvage tugs pulled the vessel off this shoal she sank immediately to the bottom eighty meters below. This event has become a local and worldwide legend. The yacht is now a protected Heritage Sunken Vessel and will forever remain where it is.... preserved immaculately by Lake Superior's pristine cold waters year round.  Bon Voyage !!!!!!                       *  1980 - The Calypso's submersible is lowered into the water to film                                                       the luxury yacht, ""Gunilda"" , that sank 80 meters down in - 1911 ** Rare photo by  Eddie SAGE H.P. ( Lake Superior, Canada.)       All of The Cousteau's  film and photography of this event was lost in a fire so this above photo is the only one in existence.     *** I also have a letter of thanks for the help our Family gave the Cousteau Expedition. It is signed by the Father and Cousteau Society founder,  Jacques-Yves-Cousteau, dated > February 12, 1981. *** I have decided to give the original photos that I took that memorable day, to The Cousteau Society along with their ""Thank you"" letter to us.  Official Document of the Luxury Yacht Gunilda  ( below ).  ~~~~~~~~~~~   Eddie  SAGE H.P.       Greenstones = Happiness "" This is it ""THE  EPIC  GREENSTONE  STORYBy: Eddie SAGE H.P.Join me in making something very special happen.Let's help people understand how to be happy and have fun in a simple way! I know how to live a simple and happy life, compassionately. I want to share my happiness and that is why this project is so incredibly important to me. I want to help people be Happy. The funds you contribute will make it possible for me to share these simple methods of how to be happy and have fun. My goal is to present awesome live seminars, worldwide. With my extensive background as a Family Counsellor and lecturer, it comes naturally for me to help others.  Storytelling  (counseling ) is a method of helping people that goes back in time to our ancestors. My ancestors in ancient times were renowned storytellers.  With your help, I am going to share my incredible life stories to help people wherever I can, like my Ojibway Ancestors did.The Ojibway Elders use storytelling to share knowledge and they use the Greenstone as a personal guide for accessing knowledge. MeegWetch* *Wisdom is what develops in a person when one puts knowledge to a wise use in their daily life. So you can see the link now, between Greenstones and Happiness, at this profound level. My Dream is to convey this profound level of knowledge to people so that more wisdom will develop in human beings. Children are born Wise, we need to keep that Wise Way growing. This is my love of life and why I am so passionate about what I do. The Greenstone is the catalyst for me to share this wisdom, now. ~~~~~~~~~~ My support team keeps me consistent and on track  KaYan  & Marvin     ~~~~~~~~~~                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                My abundant passion for life                                                                                                                     "" I am a child forever, adults need to be children.""                                                                                                                                 Eddie SAGE H.P.         My family lived in the remote wilderness of Canada on the shores of the Inland Sea called Lake Superior. The bush country was my teacher/guide. I learned from birth how to be with Nature, on my own, so that I could survive and live a happy compassionate life anywhere.                       **Nature teaches Respect **                                                                                                                The message in a bottle                 One day, when I was very young, I was alone on a remote beach on Lake Superior.  I was sitting on this pristine beach trying to break a bottle by throwing stones at it. When it wouldn't break, I went over to it and picked it up and   WOW.... inside was the message in a bottle.  It turns out that the bottle with the message in it had been on an incredible journey. It had traveled thousands of kilometers across the vast expanse of Lake Superior from the United States all the way to this beach in Canada. The C.E.O. of Alton Box Board Co. in the United States told his business friends, as they were partying on his cruise boat, that this bottle would be found by someone and it would bring them GOOD LUCK. They laughed at him. He was very confident so he threw the green bottle ( message inside ) in the water and today that someone, me Eddie ""SAGE"", who found this bottle with the message in it, is still living a life of good luck. Imagine the feelings of happiness this man had when he read my letter about me finding his message in a bottle. Imagine my feelings of wonder when I found the message in a bottle. This experience is forever etched in my Spirit. I am sure this helped me have a very Good Life.           *The purpose of this Fundraiser is to share my experiences of beautiful luck. I need to get these Greenstones and this story to as many people as possible so that this ""good luck"" will travel a long way, like that green bottle I found. The Greenstones were discovered right next to this ""message in a bottle"" beach and that C.E.O. was right on about it bringing the finder of his message in a bottle, Good LUCK. These Greenstones have been a lifetime of great joyful times with my family and friends. My Mother and younger Sister started to do lapidary, which involves the collecting of precious gemstones, because of me and my love of the Greenstones. Our whole family was closer, as we grew up, simply because we all had fun with these Greenstones, lots of fun, actually.                          I raised a beautiful son who helped edit /direct this fundraiser and he remembers the good times we had with these Greenstones. Now, we are having fun sharing our ideas together. As we were working on this project tonight, KaYan remembered how I would give these precious Greenstones to people and how it really made people so happy.  The sharing of this Greenstone Happiness Story, worldwide, depends on the success of this Greenstone Fundraiser.                There was a lot of hard work involved.                        My personal intensive research authenticated that these Greenstones are incredibly rare ( found only in one place on Earth ) and that they come from Earth's oldest rock formations found only in Northern Canada. These Scientific findings surprised me, so I did further validation over several years with major worldwide importers and exporters of gemstones. After that, I was totally certain and convinced that these gemstones were highly valuable. In fact, when I showed these Greenstones to gemstone experts, not a single one had ever seen anything like these rare Greenstones and they really wanted to have them. As a former Geologist and Mining Engineer who worked in the field, I have an expertise in this type of research and validation process. All this work was worth it, as I now look forward to the next step, after this fundraiser, which is to share this story and teach people Happiness Worldwide with the Greenstone as the catalyst.  Thanks to you, the donors, this is now possible on a quality level that was not possible before, so thanks for funding this passionate  Greenstone project. We are deeply honored to receive your donations.  "" Family fun is so precious, kinds~ of~ like these precious Greenstones ""                                                                                                     SAGE H.P.  The above Celestial event occurred while I wascreating this campaign, today.

<p>When I was a child, I would design bridal gowns for other people. I loved being creative and allowing friends conceptualize their dream dress. It was a youthful hobby that transpired into a passion. After six years of bridal sales experience, my favorite aspect of the job is helping clients feel beautiful, confident, and empowered.</p>
<p>While other retailers might focus on the ""pitch"" or the ""sale,"" my personal emphasis as a consultant has always been about asking questions. Bridal is not about selling a dress; it is about finding THE dress and selling the experience. I want all of my clients leaving the boutique with one of two things: a dream dress or knowing what they want in their dream dress.</p>
<p>The goal of the bridal boutique is to offer an all-inclusive experience through providing quality inventory, membership discounts, in-house vendors, gift bags, one-on-one consulting, key partnerships, exclusive designers, and much more. It will be a one-stop-shop. Additionally once the business grows, it is my personal ambition to offer connections and resources for all of the ""first"" in customers' lives after the wedding such as first house and first child.</p>
<p>As for financing, all of the funding will go towards obtaining a SBA loan. SBA loans require 20% of the loan upfront similar to purchasing a house. The loan amount I will be requesting is $120,000, which means I will need at least $24,000 in capital. Already, I have been denied four times by financial institutions for a variety of reasons: lack of collateral, lacking 20% down, lacking enough personal equity, and the business does not exist yet. The objective of the Indiegogo Campaign is to obtain enough capital to help finance a larger portion of my loan in hopes it will be more readily approved.</p>
<p>Instead of searching for investors or simply asking people for money, I developed a reward system that allows everyone to receive a perk equivalent to their contribution. My two personal favorites are the pound of coffee and VIP appointment!</p>
<p>To review my professional career and experience, it is based around business development, sales, and customer service. To provide some examples, I helped start up a physical therapy clinic, which now has grown to two facilities under my management; I also worked with two other local businesses to help them develop with marketing, branding, and sales to generate more revenue. Now, I am consulting remotely for two startup businesses by creating and executing a marketing plan. As for my educational background, I graduated from Hope College with a degree in Spanish and Sociocultural Anthropology in 2012. In 2015, I graduated from Cornerstone University with a Masters of Business Administration.</p>
<p>Although the local market is saturated with bridal shops, The Market Bridal Boutique will be a unique brand and business structure to the area. The business model will be exactly how it sounds, a market. We will be emphasizing relationships rather than retail to provide more for our clients, offer a trusted network, and support the local community as well.</p>

<h2>The #1 Eco-Friendly Sunglasses Designed in Italy</h2>
<p>We have designed a high-quality product and realized it with the lowest-polluting materials available. We are very proud to say that BRERA are the best sunglasses you will ever find at an accessible price point.</p>
<p><strong><i>Where style and functionality meet sustainability.</i></strong></p>

</div><div>
<p>Nowadays, the sunglasses industry is monopolized by 4 main multinational companies, which control around 90% of the market. Therefore, they have full control of pricing and they took their advantage of the situation by turning sunglasses into a luxury product. </p>
<p>However, things are starting to change thanks to brands like AUDERE, that are offering the same high-quality product at a groundbreaking accessible price. In AUDERE we produce, distribute and sell on our own. Cutting intermediaries out allows us to reduce costs and, more importantly, to do things our own way.</p>

<p>As we said, BRERA sunglasses are made from <strong><i>eco-friendly materials.</i></strong></p>
<p>Our frames are made from high resistance recycled plastic, an ultra-lightweight material that is extremely tough and flexible at the same time, and offers resistance to impact and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Our lenses, on the other hand, are <strong>POLARIZED, category 3 UV400,</strong> and will protect you against 100% of the sun's UV rays. Using the best filters in the market was a crucial matter to us, as we want to make sure that your eyes are completely protected while you are enjoying your favourite activities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, thanks to <strong>FACE ID Recognition</strong> feature, you can use your phone without needing to take your sunglasses off!</p>

<p>We have spent many hours working on our design, making sure we have something that matches every face shape and every fashion preference. </p>
<p>We were inspired both by <strong><i>the iconic Italian style</i></strong> and latest trendy contemporary designs. </p>
<p><strong>The final result is a balanced, clean, timeless and comfortable model.</strong></p>

<p>· It doesn’t require new petroleum to produce our sunglasses, thus we are lowering the demand for new petroleum extraction and reducing overall carbon footprint.</p>

</div></div>","The #1 Eco-Friendly Sunglasses Designed in Italy
We have designed a high-quality product and realized it with the lowest-polluting materials available. We are very proud to say that BRERA are the best sunglasses you will ever find at an accessible price point.
Where style and functionality meet sustainability.


Nowadays, the sunglasses industry is monopolized by 4 main multinational companies, which control around 90% of the market. Therefore, they have full control of pricing and they took their advantage of the situation by turning sunglasses into a luxury product. 
However, things are starting to change thanks to brands like AUDERE, that are offering the same high-quality product at a groundbreaking accessible price. In AUDERE we produce, distribute and sell on our own. Cutting intermediaries out allows us to reduce costs and, more importantly, to do things our own way.



We’re proud to introduce you our New Eco-Friendly Model: BRERA!
It’s made of best high-quality recycled materials and comes in 4 different colorways. But we have to warn you: Choosing only one is not an easy task!




As we said, BRERA sunglasses are made from eco-friendly materials.
Our frames are made from high resistance recycled plastic, an ultra-lightweight material that is extremely tough and flexible at the same time, and offers resistance to impact and high temperatures.
Our lenses, on the other hand, are POLARIZED, category 3 UV400, and will protect you against 100% of the sun's UV rays. Using the best filters in the market was a crucial matter to us, as we want to make sure that your eyes are completely protected while you are enjoying your favourite activities.
Furthermore, thanks to FACE ID Recognition feature, you can use your phone without needing to take your sunglasses off!

We have spent many hours working on our design, making sure we have something that matches every face shape and every fashion preference. 
We were inspired both by the iconic Italian style and latest trendy contemporary designs. 
The final result is a balanced, clean, timeless and comfortable model.





 
BRERA sunglasses are produced with recycled plastic, which makes them very respectful with the environment. Moreover, all our suppliers are audited, and have ISO9000, ISO14000 and SEDEX certifications, giving them quality certificates in health and safety for their workers, freedom of association, right to collective bargaining, remuneration and working hours compliant with laws.


Our Goal is to find a balance between fashion and sustainability.
More than 1,000 kg of plastic ends up in the ocean every five seconds. As a result, 40% of the earth’s ocean areas have already been taken over by plastic. Even if we are still not able to truly know what the long-term consequences will be, we must take responsibility and start changing this disastrous situation. 
We love our planet, nature and the ocean. That is why we decided to produce sunglasses that have an extremely low impact on environment.


Our sunglasses will be made out of recycled plastic!!!
But what does that mean?
· We give a second life to a material that’s not biodegradable and would otherwise end up in landfill or in the ocean.
· Performance and durability, including high strength and functional versatility of recycled plastic is the same as traditional one, but off course with a lower environmental impact.
· It doesn’t require new petroleum to produce our sunglasses, thus we are lowering the demand for new petroleum extraction and reducing overall carbon footprint.
We know that this is just a very small action that won’t save the planet by itself, however we firmly believe that it could be a POSITIVE example to inspire others to do the same. 


All of our backers will receive their BRERA sunglasses together with a beautiful re-usable box and a matching cloth to keep your sunglasses looking fresh.


We truly believe in our products, and in the high-quality materials that we use to produce them. That is why we offer Lifetime Warranty* to all of our backers during this initial phase.
*BRERA’s Lifetime Warranty is applicable to any product that after going through our quality check present manufacturing issues once purchased.

<p></p>
<p>The story of Smart pee-pee began more than a year ago when Tom  got his angel - the little boy Jerry. Once the paper nappy went wet, Jerry would keep crying and had a  bad sleeping especially in  the night. As new parents, Tom and wife were exhausted to take care of the little baby in the day and it was really hard for them to check the diaper frequently in the midnight . Jerry’s crying really made them heart-breaking and they become drawn for it. </p>
<p>So Tom came up with an idea.What if there’s any device which monitors the diaper and reminds for changing automatically? It'll surely make difference. This is where we start to design the smart pee-pee.</p>

</div>","·Smart wearing devices are popular but fall short of expecatation in 2015. 
·We are wondering: who need the smart device most?
·Baby！
·The one who can't tell us his need in words.







            Why Smart pee-pee



-No Red asses and diaper rash-No urine, wetness and poop on the baby’s diaper area anymore Keep the baby’s    delicate skin dry and comfortable.-Reminder in time in the night guarantee a good sleeping for baby and parents.-Magic sticker makes it available for all the diaper.-Safe and nickel free material will avoid any allergy, and make it safe for baby to  wear -If you’re ready for toilet training for your child, pee pee regularity in APP will help  you-Help new parents to become baby care expert quickly! -compatible with IOS and Android system



Press



Thin and Light
Thin in thickness, light in weight, baby feels free to wear anywhere. Round size makes the germ fee and easy to be clean. We managed to keep the Smart Pee Pee design clean and simple, stylish and practical. 



             Smart-- 24-hours  nanny





Waterproof sensor tracks the wetness and temperature  of diaper, and data is synchronized with smart phone in real time. When paper nappy is wet or soiled, with moisture and temperature increasing, phone alarms and remind you “change the diaper”. It's really a good Nanny for baby, especially in the night.





              Potty training assistant

Pee-pee record  will be kept in the phone automatically and calculation system will expect pee-pee time accordingly. What’s more, when the baby is ready for potty training, the pee record will give you a big favor.



          Goodness and Safety

Once the paper nappy went wet, Jerry would keep crying and had a  bad sleeping especially in  the night. As new parents, Tom and wife were exhausted to take care of the little baby in the day and it was really hard for them to check the diaper frequently in the midnight .

<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The following care instructions are recommended for maintaining the original properties of the fabric. Not adhering to the same affects the fabric’s 'liquid repellency' in the long run.</p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">ALWAYS machine or hand- wash in cold water</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">ALWAYS only steam iron the fabric and DO NOT use high-heat irons.</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">ALWAYS tumble dry low</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">ALWAYS turn the garment inside-out before washing</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">ALWAYS wash with like colored garments to prevent external coloration.</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">DO NOT bleach the fabric or laundry dry-clean</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">DO NOT use a fabric softener on the fabric</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Some strong detergents may affect the overall effectiveness of fabric so please test the same before washing. We recommend using an organic detergent</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">For best results, allow spills to roll off the garment; if any remains, a small amount of water will wash it away.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Q. Which stains will not work with the fabric ?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">A. Although the technology will mostly always repel water-based liquids, it’s still not impervious to dirt and oil-based stains. Hot liquids may also result in increased staining.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Q. How long will the original repellent effects stay?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">A. The original repellent properties last longer the less you wash the clothing. Normally, the fabric should easily last through 15-20 washes provided the care instructions are followed diligently.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Q. Is this fabric coating ‘certified-safe’ ?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">A. Our coating technology is ISO Certified, PFOS-free, and PFOA-free and absolutely safe</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Q. How can the wrinkles be smoothed ?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">A. Ironing on a high heat may affect the fabric but using a steam iron on a low setting will remove any wrinkles.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Q. What is the composition of the garment?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">A. 100% pure natural cotton</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong><u>IMPORTANT WARNING </u></strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">This fabric is washable but still susceptible to strong chemical-detergents. If you do not use an organic detergent, the water-repellent coating may be damaged in the washing process. Please follow the care instructions for best results and maximum durability.</p>

Aesthetic natural soft cotton clothing in combination with tested hydrophobic technology is the hallmark of ZeroW cutting edge offering in the world of upcoming apparel for the future.

 

Cotton is the most preferred fabric of all time but is also well known to be susceptible to water and all kinds of liquid stains. Addressing these problems with traditional solutions always involved a degree of degradation in regards to the overall quality of the fabric, feel and usability.
The ZeroW collection is made with an additional layer of encapsulated cotton fibers to form a protective coating capable of repelling all kinds of liquids like water, coffee, wet-dirt stains etc. and maintaining all the original qualities of cotton that we all admire so much !

 
             
                          1)                      COFFEE STAINS 
 
                           
 
                     2)                     COLOR WATER
                          
                    3)                     HONEY
 
                         
 
           
            
            
 
            
           
 
            
 
            
 
 
          
 
         
 
 
          
 
 
          

The following care instructions are recommended for maintaining the original properties of the fabric. Not adhering to the same affects the fabric’s 'liquid repellency' in the long run.

ALWAYS machine or hand- wash in cold water
ALWAYS only steam iron the fabric and DO NOT use high-heat irons.
ALWAYS tumble dry low
ALWAYS turn the garment inside-out before washing
ALWAYS wash with like colored garments to prevent external coloration.
DO NOT bleach the fabric or laundry dry-clean
DO NOT use a fabric softener on the fabric

Some strong detergents may affect the overall effectiveness of fabric so please test the same before washing. We recommend using an organic detergent
For best results, allow spills to roll off the garment; if any remains, a small amount of water will wash it away.

Q. Which stains will not work with the fabric ?
A. Although the technology will mostly always repel water-based liquids, it’s still not impervious to dirt and oil-based stains. Hot liquids may also result in increased staining.
Q. How long will the original repellent effects stay?
A. The original repellent properties last longer the less you wash the clothing. Normally, the fabric should easily last through 15-20 washes provided the care instructions are followed diligently.
Q. Is this fabric coating ‘certified-safe’ ?
A. Our coating technology is ISO Certified, PFOS-free, and PFOA-free and absolutely safe
Q. How can the wrinkles be smoothed ?
A. Ironing on a high heat may affect the fabric but using a steam iron on a low setting will remove any wrinkles.
Q. What is the composition of the garment?
A. 100% pure natural cotton
IMPORTANT WARNING 
This fabric is washable but still susceptible to strong chemical-detergents. If you do not use an organic detergent, the water-repellent coating may be damaged in the washing process. Please follow the care instructions for best results and maximum durability.

RISKS AND CHALLENGES 
MANUFACTURINGWe are in the process of continuous evolution in terms of setting up infrastructure capable of mass productions of apparel. As such for orders above 1000 pieces there could be an additional delay in the production/dispatch times.
FULFILLMENT
We try our best to ensure seamless and error-prone dispatching and shipping but are also limited to a small team handling multiple facets of the business. We would certainly try our best to resolve any issues that arise due to possible inadequacies FROM OUR END including shipping reimbursements.
DELIVERY
All orders are shipped via Priority International Shipment.  
Errors or issues with shipping companies is common and usually out of our control, however, in case of problems like stolen, lost or damaged shipments we certainly would be able to file an insurance claim with the shipment agencies, but not cover the cost of replacement if applicable.
OUR FABRICWe are dedicated to continuous improvement and quality assurance in regards to our products and services, however, it is still imperative that the recommended care and usage instructions be followed for best results. Although the fabric is washable it is still susceptible to strong chemicals like softeners and color preserving agents. Please ensure that an organic detergent is always used to ensure that the liquid-repellent coating is not damaged in the washing process. Please follow the care instructions.

<p>The objective of this project is to raise funds to start a movement, a creation of a minded community, targeted to help the earth with the three issues described before. Through a website, t-shirts and other products we're going to raise awareness and participation, and it's actually with these products that a 30% of the profits are going DIRECTLY to their respective environmental foundations.</p>
<p>Basically there are three goals that I try to achieve once this project is funded:</p>
<p>• Create awareness through the displaying of the message on the t-shirts. </p>
<p>• Encourage participation and change minds through our products message.</p>
<p>• Support foundations. A big percentage, 30% of the profit will be donated to two renowned environmental foundations, WWF and Children international.</p>

I want to develop two clothing labels that stand out due to what they stand for and therefore I want their clothes to be a deliberate statement by whoever is wearing them. As their names imply, they stand for integrity and for love. The definitions of these terms refer to the philosophy I call integritism. Which claims integrity to be the ultimate purpose of life and love to be the genuine concern for the integrity of others and eventually all.Integrity generally describes a state of being whole. But what does being whole mean when it comes to humans? How do I become whole?I claim, by living up to who I am. To who I wholly am. That means in order to gain integrity, I need to know who I am. Otherwise I don't know what to live up to.That's where integrity starts. In case You want to hear or read more about integrity and love. Please watch the project video or follow Integrity Rising and Flock of Love on Instagram.  THE SYMBOLSWith IR and FoL I want to introduce two iconic symbols. I call them the Wheel of Integrity (or the Wheel of 9) and the Lovebird.The Wheel of Integrity is a sunwheel which consits of nine 9's. 9 is the number of Integrity. Therefore it is directly referring to ""Integrity"" and also to ""Rising"".The Loverbird is a bird whose torso depicts a heart. Therefore it is directly referring to ""Flock"" and also to ""Love"". Integrity is regarded as the direction and Love as the path. Both is combined in the metaphor of a flock of birds flying towards the sun. SO FARIn the past year, I have started a first attempt to offer T-Shirts, Longsleeves and Hoodies with the woven Lovebird Patch on them. All garments are sourced from Earth Positive and the patches are sewed on by a local tailor. NEXT STEPFor the next step of FoL and IR I want to produce white and black T-Shirts and Longsleeves, which will be made from customized cutting patterns. The blank clothes will be the same for both IR and FoL. Once an order is placed they will either be screenprinted by myself or patches will be sewed onto them by a local tailor. Therefore one part of the funding will be used to create the cutting patterns and to produce: - 150 white T-Shirts (100% cotton / 180 GSM single jersey / sizes XS-3XL) - 150 black T-Shirts (100% cotton / 180 GSM single jersey / sizes XS-3XL) - 150 white Longsleeves (100% cotton / 180 GSM single jersey / sizes XS-3XL) - 150 black Longsleeves (100% cotton / 180 GSM single jersey / sizes XS-3XL)All T-Shirts and Longsleeves will have woven neck labels with the IR and FoL Logos. They will also have the woven L2L label at the bottom left. Which stands for ""learn to live"" and ""learn to love"".SizingThe specifications are only indicative and may differ slightly from actual clothes. The Longsleeves will be the same length as the T-shirts but slightly slimmer.All garments will be produced by Kipepeo Clothing in Tanzania and Kenya. Besides their own clothing, they also offer to produce clothing for other labels. Kipepeo only uses organic cotton from Tanzania and they guarantee fair working conditions to support the local economy.Here is a beautiful documentary about Kipepeo.

Our meticulously designed, ultra soothing weighted jacket channels the power of deep touch pressure to give you a hug that lasts all day.Our signature Anxiety Armor weighted inner vest distributes deep touch pressure across the upper torso, bringing you immediate therapeutic effects with only a fraction of the weight of a weighted blanket.The Goldfinch Jacket is now available in two options: the classic bomber and the cozy zip hoodie. Both are packed with features designed to enhance your anxiety relief experience. They include ergonomic front-closure and pocket zippers, a fitted rib knit collar and cuffs, and giant soft pockets for discreet fidgeting. The Anxiety Armor inner vest is attached to the outer jacket with easy-to-use hidden zippers and snaps.The fleece outer jacket is super soft to the touch, with a smooth, cool cotton lining. As soon as you put it on, you feel a comforting weight across your shoulders, chest, and upper back that feels like a gentle hug – reassuring, but not constricting. Like swaddling a baby, the Goldfinch Jacket provides instant relief that stays with you even after you take it off. Everyday life is packed with stressors. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, 1 in 4 Americans reported suffering from a stress or anxiety related disorder in 2018. Now in 2020, we’re facing an unprecedented global pandemic that has created immense and sudden lifestyle changes for everyone in the world. Adapting to a new way of life is stressful, and uncertainty is even worse. Panic, stress, and anxiety are everywhere, and it can be difficult to find even a moment of relief.Chronic stress doesn’t just affect your emotional experience – it can contribute to long-term health problems like heart disease, diabetes, and even cancer.The most effective treatment methods for stress and anxiety are medication and therapy, but those options aren’t accessible to everyone. Even those who have achieved a good balance with their treatment sometimes need a little extra support. That’s why we’re here to bring you the perfect anxiety relief tool – one that can bring you instant comfort no matter where you are or what you’re doing. Deep touch pressure activates the parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for calming the body down after stress. Essentially, it creates the opposite of the fight or flight response, allowing your body to rest and reset.Like weighted blankets, the calming effects of weighted wearables are helpful for everyone. Deep touch pressure has been scientifically proven to naturally and immediately decrease perceived levels of stress and anxiety in many populations, including college students, children with sensory processing difficulties, and anyone who finds comfort in a hug.Care centers use weighted wearables to help calm patients’ anxiety and promote focus and relaxation. On top of that, studies show that weighted wearables also increase your ability to cope with daily stressors.The Goldfinch Jacket can be used to bring relief to any stressful daily task, including commuting, shopping, studying, working, or cleaning your home. It’s also the perfect tool for increasing relaxation during your downtime, especially during naps, meditation, or even just hanging out on the couch.No matter what you’re doing, putting on the Goldfinch Jacket brings you an immediate reduction in stress and anxiety, and an increase in comfort and calm. The Goldfinch Jacket is more than just the science behind it.

<h4>THE TORQ TEAM – Innovative minds</h4>
<p><b>Tom O’Rourke - CEO</b>  20 years in the start-up world and creator of
the TORQ Racquet System.  Past Director
of Product Development for the company who invented the game. </p>
<b>Mark Nakagawa – Head of Product Development  </b><span>Mark invented the interchangeable paddle idea together with Tom O’Rourke.  He has invented other breakthrough products
in sports apparel and ski design and has seen how innovations can change the
sports world, from tennis racquet technology, to revolutionary bat handle
design.  </span><br/>
</div><h4>THE MARKET NEED:  A Lack of Innovation</h4><div>
<p>Pickleball
is the fastest growing sport in the US, having grown from 450,000 players to almost 2 million over the past ten
years.  It is expected to reach 4
million players by 2020.</p>
<p>The
sport is 50 years old, but it has been mostly a cottage industry
until three years ago.  </p>
<p>The
last breakthrough idea happened in the 1980s when commercial airplane flooring
composite replaced wood as a new paddle material.  Since then every new paddle has been based on
that same idea.</p>
<p>Now
the best players are people coming from other
racquet sports.  They expect space
age/carbon fiber “racquet” design, and are accustomed to playing with - and paying
for - truly high-quality equipment. 
Tennis, racquetball and squash blogs are full of stories of Pickleball,
and how people have added Pickleball to their routines, or switched entirely to
this new, less injury prone sport.</p>
<p>TORQ
Sports Group has found a way to create a new evolution in the sport, to help it
grow to levels of high expectation and performance that other sports like
tennis and racquetball already enjoy. TORQ has invented and patented a new
paddle design that delivers higher performance, simpler manufacturing, less
expensive updates and replacements, and allows the entire industry to
participate in its success.</p>
<p>
<u>Who we are:</u></p>
<p>TORQ
Sports Group is a Seattle based company made up of experts in the Pickleball and
racquet sport industry.  Its vision is to
introduce new innovative designs and sales development techniques to this
rapidly growing sport.  </p>
<p>The
sport of Pickleball began in the late 1960s as a diversion for a family in
Bainbridge Island to keep the kids busy during the summer months.  The first games were played with wooden
paddles and a whiffle-ball found in a garage. 
The family quickly made up rules and gave structure to a court sport
that was fast, energetic and, most importantly, fun.</p>
<p><u>The
evolution of today’s Pickleball equipment:</u></p>
<p>For
years the game was played with wooden paddles cut out of simple plywood
sheets.  Soon handle forms were added and
lighter types of wood were found.  But
not till the mid 1980s did a new paddle concept arrive when a Boeing engineer took
airplane flooring material, made up of light composite honeycomb cores and
graphite surfaces, and used it as a wood substitute.  Its light weight yet sturdy construction
provided the first real breakthrough in the sport.  Suddenly paddle design began to be a major
factor, creating significant advantages to players and changing the make-up of
the market.</p>
<p>Since
that time, all manufacturers have built their paddles with the same
construction methods and concepts.  Not
one significant new paddle idea has appeared.</p>

The
TORQ Sports Group was created to change all that.<br/>

<h3>Are You Ready for Adventure?</h3>
<p>Every day, there are people who lunge toward adventure, letting nothing stand between them and all of the fun and thrills they know are out there. When they hear that there is an opportunity to explore or a destination they can visit, they are all in. Without hesitation, without question, they jump forward, flying or sailing or driving to someplace new – seeing all there is to see in the world and making the most of life.</p>
<p>Is this you?</p>
<p>If so, then we are right there by your side.</p>
<p>At GRID Watches, we are adventurers, explorers, and dreamers ourselves. We never tire of seeing the world, pushing ourselves to uncover all of its mysteries and learn all that we can learn. Often, we look back on the memories that we have made, thinking back lovingly of the grand places that we have visited and the incredible times that we have shared together.</p>
<p>To keep this sense of wonder and adventure always with us, we created a quaility watch – something new, something unique.</p>
<p>Welcome to GRID Watches.</p>
<p>On every watch, we aim to capture the inspiration and sense of adventure and travel, while offering an exclusive quality for professionals alike. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1601297111/vmxkfpwn91r7so7j6wyz.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><strong>About the Watches</strong></p>
<p>Our watches are stylish and world-class, featuring:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multi-layered City Grid Dial</li>
<li>Japanese Quartz Movement</li>
<li>Luminous hands and markers</li>
<li>Stainless Steel Case and Bracelet</li>
<li>Detailed Engravings</li>
<li>Quickchange Bracelet and Bands</li>
<li>And More! </li>
</ul>
<p>That is not all, though. What makes your GRID watch unique is that the case comes engraved. On the layered face, printed and made out of 3D steel, there is a unique design, something that will remind you of all your adventures and encourage you to seek out even more.</p>
<p>Inspired by adventure and developed by travelers just like you, a watch from GRID Watches stands for the courage to venture into the unknown.</p>
<p>Are you ready to upgrade your style and take your sense of adventure to the next level?</p>
<p>You’re ready. So are we.</p>
<p>Let’s do this together.<br/> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1601296669/ijt0psi76gwgqonptx6y.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Right now, we are pre-selling GRID watches for a limited time only so that we can raise the capital we need to cover part of the first order and support the brand long term. Our goal through this campaign is $<b><i><u>29,000</u></i></b>, which, when partnered with our personal investments, will cover all of the costs that we are facing as we work to go to market. The more that we raise, the smoother the next few months will go for us, and if we raise anything over our funding goal, we will divert the remainder into support and advertising, bringing GRID Watches to an even larger audience.</p>
<p>If you want a watch that says adventure and travel, yet is modern &amp; professional, you have found it.</p>
<p>Contribute to this campaign and claim yours today!<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>As both travelers and entrepreneurs, we created GRID Watches because we wanted a watch that speaks to us on a personal level. We’ve researched what else was out there, and we felt the need to go our own way. After all of the places that we have experienced and every adventure that we have encountered, our creative side took over and we put together the design that would turn into the first GRID watch.</p>
<p>Your contribution is, in a real way, helping us bring our dream to life. For that, we are very thankful. We want GRID Watches to be more than just a watch, your support will help us launch as a brand as well brining future great watches to the world. <br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Over the past year we have put significant effort into the planning of the pre-production process and launch of the GRID Watch series.

</div></div>","Are You Ready for Adventure?
Every day, there are people who lunge toward adventure, letting nothing stand between them and all of the fun and thrills they know are out there. When they hear that there is an opportunity to explore or a destination they can visit, they are all in. Without hesitation, without question, they jump forward, flying or sailing or driving to someplace new – seeing all there is to see in the world and making the most of life.
Is this you?
If so, then we are right there by your side.
At GRID Watches, we are adventurers, explorers, and dreamers ourselves. We never tire of seeing the world, pushing ourselves to uncover all of its mysteries and learn all that we can learn. Often, we look back on the memories that we have made, thinking back lovingly of the grand places that we have visited and the incredible times that we have shared together.
To keep this sense of wonder and adventure always with us, we created a quaility watch – something new, something unique.
Welcome to GRID Watches.
On every watch, we aim to capture the inspiration and sense of adventure and travel, while offering an exclusive quality for professionals alike. 
About the Watches
Our watches are stylish and world-class, featuring:

Multi-layered City Grid Dial
Japanese Quartz Movement
Luminous hands and markers
Stainless Steel Case and Bracelet
Detailed Engravings
Quickchange Bracelet and Bands
And More! 

That is not all, though. What makes your GRID watch unique is that the case comes engraved. On the layered face, printed and made out of 3D steel, there is a unique design, something that will remind you of all your adventures and encourage you to seek out even more.
Inspired by adventure and developed by travelers just like you, a watch from GRID Watches stands for the courage to venture into the unknown.
Are you ready to upgrade your style and take your sense of adventure to the next level?
You’re ready. So are we.
Let’s do this together. 


What We Need & What You Get
Right now, we are pre-selling GRID watches for a limited time only so that we can raise the capital we need to cover part of the first order and support the brand long term. Our goal through this campaign is $29,000, which, when partnered with our personal investments, will cover all of the costs that we are facing as we work to go to market. The more that we raise, the smoother the next few months will go for us, and if we raise anything over our funding goal, we will divert the remainder into support and advertising, bringing GRID Watches to an even larger audience.
If you want a watch that says adventure and travel, yet is modern & professional, you have found it.
Contribute to this campaign and claim yours today! 

The Impact
 
As both travelers and entrepreneurs, we created GRID Watches because we wanted a watch that speaks to us on a personal level. We’ve researched what else was out there, and we felt the need to go our own way. After all of the places that we have experienced and every adventure that we have encountered, our creative side took over and we put together the design that would turn into the first GRID watch.
Your contribution is, in a real way, helping us bring our dream to life. For that, we are very thankful. We want GRID Watches to be more than just a watch, your support will help us launch as a brand as well brining future great watches to the world.  

Risks & Challenges
Over the past year we have put significant effort into the planning of the pre-production process and launch of the GRID Watch series. Although we cannot prepare for every contingency, we are confident that we can ship your GRID watch to you in a timely manner, following up on manufacturing and the supply chain diligently. We will also keep you updated every step of the way, sending out regular updates about all of the progress that we are making. You can count on us for complete transparency and customer service.

<div>Our story began 6 months ago when we, university students, were dreaming of having a company of our own. But we've never thought going this far !</div>
<div>This dream became an idea, and this idea became those products that we propose to you here.. the fruit of months of hard work. </div>
<div>Our products combine two of nature's most precious and prestigious gifts.. wood and leather. We've carefully chosen our materials, and quality was, and still is, our main concern.</div>
<div>The originality of the concept made us confident in this idea and in the support that we'll eventually get from you. </div>
<div>But the road is still long and risky, and your support is now most needed, for us to continue this exciting journey.</div>

<p><b>Now.. How much do we need to make it come a reality ?</b></p>
<p>Not a lot actually.. Already having a small workshop, we are willing to acquire new machines to launch the mass-production, as well as to open a salespoint to meet the demand of the market.</p>
<p><b>What do you get in return ?</b></p>
<p>The originality of our products will make you different. It has the elegance that you expect, and the practicality that you need. We are a unique startup by its ambition, with an authentic touch unequaled by our competitors. </p>
<p>But that's not all of it, you'll get to be part of the Wood'n Leather story.. the Wood'n Leather family.</p>
<p>So, if you believe in us and want to help us taking this to the next level, we invite you to support us and choose your product below !</p>

</div></div>","Greetings from the Wood'n Leather family !
Our story began 6 months ago when we, university students, were dreaming of having a company of our own. But we've never thought going this far !
This dream became an idea, and this idea became those products that we propose to you here.. the fruit of months of hard work. 
Our products combine two of nature's most precious and prestigious gifts.. wood and leather. We've carefully chosen our materials, and quality was, and still is, our main concern.
The originality of the concept made us confident in this idea and in the support that we'll eventually get from you. 
But the road is still long and risky, and your support is now most needed, for us to continue this exciting journey.





Now.. How much do we need to make it come a reality ?
Not a lot actually.. Already having a small workshop, we are willing to acquire new machines to launch the mass-production, as well as to open a salespoint to meet the demand of the market.
What do you get in return ?
The originality of our products will make you different. It has the elegance that you expect, and the practicality that you need. We are a unique startup by its ambition, with an authentic touch unequaled by our competitors. 
But that's not all of it, you'll get to be part of the Wood'n Leather story.. the Wood'n Leather family.
So, if you believe in us and want to help us taking this to the next level, we invite you to support us and choose your product below !
Don't forget to spread the word !
Thank you for your time and your trust !",13.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Yes, in any perks, the strap is included free of cost. You also have options to choose.</p>
<p><strong>Is the shoulder strap completely detachable?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, there are clasps at both ends of the strap that it is completely detachable. </p>
<p><strong>What is the quality of material used on personalized initials? </strong></p>
<p>It is not a hand-painting. For instance, few brands like LV bags, GYD bags do hand painting. It costs extremely high, plus takes 2~3 months solely for the initializing work. We have chosen to go 'cost &amp; time-effective'. The way we accomplish the personalized initials is printing on the fabric. We put your initials in design program and do the computer print out on the fabric. Imagine a beautiful t-shirt print. That is it. The difference is that... we make it personal. </p>

This is why we have developed the <strong>hard coating technology.</strong></p><p align=""justify"">The watch is built from stainless steel 316L treated in a special way. We called it <strong>HHC - Haldor hard coating</strong>. This process creates a hardened barrier about 25microns deep on the upper layer of the metal, so the upper layer of the metal becomes much harder. We can reach about 1800Hv (vickers) for the stainless steel (that's <strong>7 times harder</strong> than the normal stainless steel!). The process consists of depositing on the surface of the watch, a hard but thin dense layer of metal consisting of steel, titanium, ceramic and an alloy of the nickel-copper family. The coating provides<strong> long lasting protection against the inevitable scratches and wear marks that affect the aesthetic appearance of the watch.

If you buy a Swiss made watch from a famous brand in a retail shop, the markup is much higher. There are many brokers in between like the wholesalers, distributors, retailers... Each of them have their own markup, that is why the final price of the product if significantly higher at the end. In our case there is no need to do so! Our watches are sold<strong> directly to you</strong>, avoiding all the extra costs incurred. <br/>The most famous brands in the World have a long tradition. When you purchase those watches, you definitely pay extra money for the brand's image. This is one of the reasons why the final price of our competitors is much higher. By purchasing a Haldor watch, <strong>you are not charged for the ""brand's image""</strong>. <br/>Thanks to our Swiss manufacturing company, which is able to supply us the <strong>Swiss Made ETA 2824-2 at a very competitive price</strong>, we were capable to lower the final price of the product. This is our great advantage compared to other microbrands in watch industry. </p><p align=""justify"">By doing so we could manufacture a high-end Swiss made watch for a very interesting price and offer to you <strong>the best value for money! </strong><br/><br/>Another competitive advantage is definitely the <strong>Swiss-Origin</strong>. The watches are manufactured in Switzerland according to the strict rules of Switzerland watchmaking, from the preliminary stages to the assembly of each component, quality and technical controls. There are many microbrands claiming to be Swiss Made, but actually they just use Swiss movements. This is not enough to pass the criteria of Swissness.  </p><p><strong>Haldor Armis meets al the Swissness criteria to determine the geographical origin of the watch.

Thanks to you, the Haldor Abissi is now enjoyed by many people all over the World. In more than one year we learned a lot, improved some techniques and now we are ready to impress you again. After a market research, we started developing the new concept. We also received many emails with customer's desires about our next model. In the basis of this, the conclusion was made: ""Let's make a professional tool watch for everyday use."" Below we will explain what a professional tool watch is. Haldor Armis is an automatic professional tool watch capable of withstanding water pressure up to a depth of 2000m/6600ft, equipped with a Swiss Made ETA 2824-2 automatic movement. It is still a dive watch, but we called it ""tool watch"" because if its special features. A SHORT HANDS ON REVIEW OF THE ARMIS  The Haldor Armis 2000m will be produced also in limited DLC edition 50 pcs worldwide. Each piece will have its serial number engraved on the case like 01/50 and so on. The watch has same specs as the hard coated Armis. The only difference is that instead of HHC treatment on steel we did the black DLC (Diamond-Like Carbon coating).  It also provides excellent scratch resistance. DLC is made with a chemical vapor deposition technique. The chemicals are deposited in a vacuum environment with the help of an inert gas that places the carbon atoms on the surface. They form a thin layered plating of diamond crystal mixed with carbon atoms. In partnership with our Italian supplier known for producing high quality rubber diver straps for many of the world's most famous watchmakers. The rubber strap is fitted with hard coated sandblasted 20mm pin buckle. The pieces length are 133mm/75mm excluding buckle. Thickness for 5,5mm (lug end) to 3,7mm. Lug width 22mm, buckle width 20mm.The new bracelet is designed to perfectly fit your wrist. It is 4mm thick, 22mm wide and 200mm long (including the buckle). With additional set of screwdrivers it is very easy to adjust the size. Case dimensions: the diameter is 42mm (excluding crown), lug-to-lug of 50mm, thickness of 14.9mm and 22mm wide drilled lugs. The Swiss SuperLuminova BGW9 is applied to the hands, dial marking and bezel triangle. It is very strong, easy to read by night and long lasting. Please look at the following video to see what happens with the lume after 5 mins. The results are fascinating.

 
 
THE MOVEMENT     Like in our previous model, inside the Armis is a ETA 2824-2 Swiss automatic movement adjusted in 5 positions what makes the movement precise like a COSC Chronometer. Thanks to our Swiss manufacturing company we were able to adjust the movement from keeping time from -+15 sec per day, to +4 sec per day! By doing so, the movement will keep time like a Top Grade or a COSC Chronometer.  You can see the accuracy of Haldor Armis is about +3,9s/d with a maximum daily variation of 7sec. The results are fascinating, and we are proud of it. Each watch supplied by Haldor Watches will pass the quality control and water pressure tests. Every single watch will be adjusted in 5 positions to obtain the max accuracy possible, which will come with its technical data of accuracy shown like on photo. We guarantee out of the box accuracy of about +4s/d.  Magnetic fields are one of the most common factors negatively affecting the accuracy of a mechanical watch. Metal internal watch parts can become magnetized when introduced to these fields. That's why we have protected the the movement with a Faraday cage, that attracts the magnetic field lines, leaving the movement itself unaffected. The watch movement is protected up to 4.800 ampere per meter (A/m). THE DESIGNOur engineers have not only worked on the design of the Armis, but have turned their attention to the very fabric that is used for the construction of it and its components. 316L Stainless steel is considered to be among the best materials available for the construction of dive watches.

It really works perfectly, without any problems and keeps your watch safe by falling from your wrist, because it opens only by pressing both security buttons in.  THE METALHowever even the toughest Marine Grade Stainless steel is prone to scratches. We’ve all experienced that dreaded moment when your new diver receives its first knock or scratch. If you wear your dive watch like it’s supposed to be worn – for diving and such, then it’s only a matter of time before the rigors of an active life take their toll on it. This is why we have developed the hard coating technology.The watch is built from stainless steel 316L treated in a special way. We called it HHC - Haldor hard coating. This process creates a hardened barrier about 25microns deep on the upper layer of the metal, so the upper layer of the metal becomes much harder. We can reach about 1800Hv (vickers) for the stainless steel (that's 7 times harder than the normal stainless steel!). The process consists of depositing on the surface of the watch, a hard but thin dense layer of metal consisting of steel, titanium, ceramic and an alloy of the nickel-copper family. The coating provides long lasting protection against the inevitable scratches and wear marks that affect the aesthetic appearance of the watch. It also provides excellent resistance to corrosion.  WATER RESISTANCEThe watch passed all pressure and water resistance tests made in the Swiss lab.    What do you get by buying the Haldor Armis watch? We called it ""The most perfect tool watch"". What makes the watch better than others? Let's focus on the details.Watches like this costs from 1500USD and up. There are very few brands in the World producing similar watches at our price point, because the technology is very advanced, our markup is very low, and only few factories are capable to do this. 
How we made it?
    We have lowered the final price of our product by having a very low markup. If you buy a Swiss made watch from a famous brand in a retail shop, the markup is much higher. There are many brokers in between like the wholesalers, distributors, retailers... Each of them have their own markup, that is why the final price of the product if significantly higher at the end. In our case there is no need to do so! Our watches are sold directly to you, avoiding all the extra costs incurred. The most famous brands in the World have a long tradition. When you purchase those watches, you definitely pay extra money for the brand's image. This is one of the reasons why the final price of our competitors is much higher. By purchasing a Haldor watch, you are not charged for the ""brand's image"". Thanks to our Swiss manufacturing company, which is able to supply us the Swiss Made ETA 2824-2 at a very competitive price, we were capable to lower the final price of the product. This is our great advantage compared to other microbrands in watch industry. By doing so we could manufacture a high-end Swiss made watch for a very interesting price and offer to you the best value for money! Another competitive advantage is definitely the Swiss-Origin. The watches are manufactured in Switzerland according to the strict rules of Switzerland watchmaking, from the preliminary stages to the assembly of each component, quality and technical controls. There are many microbrands claiming to be Swiss Made, but actually they just use Swiss movements. This is not enough to pass the criteria of Swissness.  Haldor Armis meets al the Swissness criteria to determine the geographical origin of the watch. So we can legitimately claim to be of Swiss origin.You can read more about the requirements here: http://www.fhs.swiss/eng/swissness.html                                     STRETCH GOALS           Our exclusive satisfaction guarantee makes it easy, convenient and safe for you to pre-order a watch from our campaign. Our watches are manufactured at the highest quality standards, but they cannot always fit everyone.If you feel that the watch did not meet your expectations, simply contact us and we will send you a 100% refund of the watch cost. Please note all the shipping and customs cost must be covered by you in case you return the watch back to us.

Do not forget - free shipping for first 30 backers! Our story begun in 2009 when we started searching for right partners to create our own watch brand. It took us 4 years to find and sign all agreements for cooperation with external companies and partners. In 2013 we formalized our commitment with the incorporation of the company and started working full time on the project.We knew from the beginning that the level of expertise and professionality of our partners have to be top notch. Our demands were very high and the whole process was no walk in the park. We queried over a dozen of companies to identify the best fit for our project. They host the manufacturing for the most famous Swiss and German brands.By »Swiss Made« we are not limited to the Swiss movement. We mean that all our products will have Swiss-Origin certificate. So, our watches are manufactured in Switzerland according to the strict rules of Switzerland watchmaking, from the preliminary stages to the assembly of each component, quality and technical controls.What to tell more? We made a Swiss Made automatic watch with a technical specification like high-end brands at price level interesting both for enthusiasts and more demanding customers. So, we at Haldor Watches are extremely confident the Haldor Armis will meet your needs.  YOUR SUPPORTThe Armis has been prototyped and fully tested. Now everything is set up to start the production. This time our campaign has a fixed goal, so we will only receive the funds if at least 40.000USD is raised by the deadline. Otherwise you will automatically receive a full refund by Indiegogo.com once the campaign ends. Reaching the goal will help us to start the production, because we have to pay the initial order fee. By pledging you are not just buying the watch, you are supporting our project and helping us to make it a reality.  There are ways you can help besides backing our campaign financially. We need help from a community of friends who love watches and being a part of turning dreams into reality. Growing that community can be done for free. If you love what you've seen here, please ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about our campaign.  Thank you! :) RISKS & CHALLENGESManufacturing an item is not an easy walk in the park. Especially when you want to make it different and better than others. That's why sometimes things go wrong. We didn't want you to risk when contributing, so we already set the basis and everything is prepared to start the production. There are no risks for you or any doubts about the product quality. Since the watches are exported from Switzerland to Slovenia, please be aware that there may be unexpected circumstances that may lead to late delivery. During the pre-order period we will keep you posted about the production process and delivery time.",63.0,5,"2 Campaigns

With our market-leading partner vTuner, you will not miss any radio station.""It's a big world out there, and vTuner has it covered.""You want to hear your favorite music? Connect Badio via Bluetooth to 
stream any content from your smartphone or tablet and use it like a 
usual Bluetooth Speaker!   
If you have to get out of your bed in the night, you don't want to 
see bright light or hear loud music. At daytime, you don't like dimmed 
light and quiet music. That's why Badio gives you the possibility to 
preset the volume, brightness and light color to each time of the day.
  The music playback turns automatically on and off with the light by 
tripping the light switch. This is just as practial as that your car 
radio turns on with your car.  Badio is the only fully integrated solution to hear music in your 
bathroom without any structural alteration works. It is as easy to 
install as any other ceiling light. Screw it to the ceiling, connect to 
your Wi-Fi and enjoy. No cables, no space wasted on your shelves. Because Badio is mounted 
on the ceiling, it smoothly integrates into your bathroom.  Two excellenct speaker drivers, integrated in the housing made of 
high quality materials, give Badio the sound of a HiFi speaker.  Particulary in the bathroom where water easily gets to where it 
shouldn't, electrical appliances represent a major hazard. Not with 
Badio! It is fixed at the ceiling, thus ensuring your secure music 
experience.

<h3>Introducing the SafelyTag from GoSafely™</h3>
<p>We built our SafelyTags to make safety simple. Designed after our founder was sexually assaulted as a freshman in college, our team spent almost a year developing and finetuning our devices. The goal of our product was to make safety accessible without escalating the violence of a situation, pepper spray, loud alarms, and campus emergency phones all added a potential for escalation.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506707404/lukwxtl8o7q4yd9ntzac.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The SafelyTag is simple to use and does not require the use of a smartphone to send an alert. Whether you want to let your family know you made it home safely or you need to nonverbally get help with your exact location and pertinent medical information, we believe that help should be easy to get.

</div></div>","Introducing the SafelyTag from GoSafely™
We built our SafelyTags to make safety simple. Designed after our founder was sexually assaulted as a freshman in college, our team spent almost a year developing and finetuning our devices. The goal of our product was to make safety accessible without escalating the violence of a situation, pepper spray, loud alarms, and campus emergency phones all added a potential for escalation.

The SafelyTag is simple to use and does not require the use of a smartphone to send an alert. Whether you want to let your family know you made it home safely or you need to nonverbally get help with your exact location and pertinent medical information, we believe that help should be easy to get. As our first batches of product are ordered, we need your help to bring our life-saving technology to the keychains, backpacks, and bike racks of millions. 
How does it all work?
The SafelyTag is easy to use in all situations, simply press the button and your location is sent to loved ones or law enforcement. In cases where law enforcement is contacted we also save the live audio securely in our app.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The Y behind <i>UNITY</i></strong></h3>
<p><strong>Mission: </strong>To create a mindful fashion brand focused on unifying humanity.</p>
<p><strong>Vision: </strong>To build awareness of our similarities and create oneness, regardless of gender, age, race, ethnicity, faith or sexual orientation, and support non-profit organizations that align with the principles of unifying humanity.</p>
<p><i><strong>“You must be the change you wish to see in the world”  </strong></i>is, perhaps, one of our favorite quotes of all time. A quote that not only inspires us to do our part and join efforts with those around us aiming to unify humanity, but also the basic impetus which drove the decision to create UNITY.</p>
<p>So, before we acted, we asked ourselves two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>How can we help unify humanity?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How can we help make unity a habit?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>While these questions may not seem too complex on the surface, history has proven that unifying humanity is no easy task. <strong>The Smithsonian Museum of Natural history has stated that all modern humans living today share 99.9% of the same DNA…aka, we are 99.9% similar!</strong> But, despite our 99.9% DNA match and thousands of years on earth being fully aware that humanity presents itself in a multitude of ways, we continue to struggle to unite.</p>
<p>Rather than seeking to understand each other, we get caught up in passing judgement for reasons like who we voted for in the last election, the religion we practice, who we kiss goodnight, material possessions, etc. When we forget how to understand one another, we create barriers between each other. Because we as humans have created these barriers, we are optimistic that we as humans can break them down. But, this involves making a conscious decision to change how we behave and change how we approach our common problems.</p>
<p>Einstein could not have been more accurate when he said, <strong><i>“we can’t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.” </i></strong>(Thanks, Einstein!).</p>
<p>The scope of a project to unify humanity is so large that we realized that we need help. In our search for like-minded people, we found many organizations already working toward the same goals. These organizations have a pre-existing network of people who need more resources to help expand their influence and build unity.</p>
<p>So, to answer question 1…. <strong>How can we help unify humanity?</strong></p>
<p>We will build a brand that shares revenue and influence with organizations whose missions align with unifying humanity and run counter to building barriers. Simply put, if we can join forces with organizations and people who believe in building on our similarities rather than our differences, we can then uplift the human condition and gain traction. 30% of all profits will be shared with organizations vetted by Charity Navigator.</p>
<p>To answer question 2… <strong>How can we make unity a habit?</strong></p>
<p>We will work to instill a mindset in others of seeking first to understand our similarities and then finding ways to align those same similarities to create unity. If we can make this a daily mindset among our neighbors, then by default, unity will become a habit.</p>
<p>Sounds simple, right? It most certainly can be...</p>

</div></div>","OUR MISSIONBrightening minds, one puzzle at the time.Sparking our children's creativity. Here at Margareta we believe that within every child lies a mind with unbelievable potential. We think of our toys as a spark to ignite their creative potential.                                              INTRODUCING MARGARETAMargareta is a Croatian brand that produces educational, high quality, handmade, and Eco-friendly toys for children.
Margareta is a set of wooden multicolored geometric shapes that are didactic puzzles. They can be converted into 3D shapes such as trees, houses, mountains, etc.Margareta toys are made of lightweight, high-quality linden wood, and are painted with environmentally safe non-toxic paints. They come in a recyclable cardboard box along with instructions.
                                                        HOW DOES IT WORK?Children ages two and up will enjoy
balancing shapes, while the older children can arrange pieces in a cardboard
box as instructed. Margareta toys develops logical thinking, visual perception,
improves concentration, helps learning the basic colors, and also provide great
entertainment for  the whole family. PINESHOUSESTREESMOUNTAINSHOUSE&PINES                                                                  WHY INVEST?Behind Margareta toys hides me, academic sculptor Margareta Lekic. After years of artistic and pedagogical experience with children of different age I decided to combine a love for art and logic which resulted as educational toys for children. 
I make toys in a small workshop with old tools. Now, I would be happy to move to a slightly bigger factory and buy some new saws, sanding machines, packaging and paint, don't forget the paint! ;) This is why I'm here, to give children beautiful childhood moments of happiness.These simple but yet so beautiful and classic toys need to stay out of boxes at all cost, don't you think?I need 12,500 $ for all this to happen.So now you know me, my brand and what I want to do.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">WHO IS ZAHND &amp; KORMANN? A BRIEF INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>Lets take it step by step and give those who do not know us yet a short heads up:    </p>
<p>We, that's Roger Zahnd &amp; Florian Kormann, are two friends from Bern, Switzerland, aiming to make our lifetime dream come true and create our own swiss watch brand... together with you.</p>
<p>Back in 2017 we started our journey with the ZK No.1, a Swiss Made Automatic Chronograph with full calendar and moon phase, powered by the legendary ETA 7751 automatic movement, which we sold over 250 times through crowdfunding on Kickstarter and Indiegogo.</p>

<p><strong>But what is our motivation and why should you get a watch from a young, upcoming but mostly unknown Swiss Brand?</strong> For us this is not about the fast money. If it comes over night that's of course ok for us. But the goal of our project is to create a sustainable watch brand, to offer quality, to learn and to improve with every new timepiece we create.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the Z&amp;K automatic watches are the perfect introduction to the world of mechanical watches for watch newbies and on the other hand they are a great addition to the existing collection for watch enthusiasts.</p>
<p>And it is also the story of taking a once in a lifetime chance in order to realize a dream. This is how we came up with our slogan <strong>""Time is YOURS!""</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Now we are back with our second watch the ZK No.2</strong> a Swiss Made Automatic watch powered by a <strong>chronometer certified</strong> automatic movement. The watches are available in two versions: As a diver watch and as a GMT watch.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">SWISS MADE AND CERTIFIED</h2>
<p>What makes these watches really special, next to the super cool design, is the fact that the watches are powered by chronometer movements, which are certified by the COSC institute in Le Locle.</p>
<p><strong>Less than &lt;3% </strong>off all movements produced in Switzerland are chronometer certified. And each ZK No.2 comes with one of those.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1583611456/b3vah5g3wzesykin1hbx.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>As the name suggests, the COSC issues quality certificates for chronometers based on a standardized measuring procedure according to NIHS 95-11 / ISO 3159. This test of the movement lasts 15 days, during which the movement's rate is determined in five different positions at three temperatures.</p>
<p>Each movement certified by the COSC is individually numbered and will come with an official certificate.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</strong></h2>
<p>If we would tell you that crowdfunding is without risks and easy, then this would be a lie. And believe us, we know what we are talking about. Unfortunately we had to overcome some obstacles in the past.</p>
<p>One year ago we tried to get the production of the ZK No.2 funded on Kickstarter. We did reach our funding goal but unfortunately we had to make a detour due to short-term adjustments from suppliers. Thats why we are back on Indiegogo to finally reach our goal. To do so we need to sell a little more than 100 additional watches. And thanks to your support we will get there.</p>
<p>So as you can see we allready went through the highest highs and the lowest lows. The biggest risk is that we are a small company and are depending on our suppliers. If they get an order from a big player, we for sure will be priority two, three or five. Means that there is always the risk of delays and changes in the schedule. But due to the fact that we are already experienced, we do not get into panic mode. We do adapt and keep going until we reach our goal. </p>
<p>This is our lifetime dream and we do our very best that it comes true. And you know what? So far we allways delivered.</p>
<p> </p>

WHO IS ZAHND & KORMANN? A BRIEF INTRODUCTION
Lets take it step by step and give those who do not know us yet a short heads up:    
We, that's Roger Zahnd & Florian Kormann, are two friends from Bern, Switzerland, aiming to make our lifetime dream come true and create our own swiss watch brand... together with you.
Back in 2017 we started our journey with the ZK No.1, a Swiss Made Automatic Chronograph with full calendar and moon phase, powered by the legendary ETA 7751 automatic movement, which we sold over 250 times through crowdfunding on Kickstarter and Indiegogo.

But what is our motivation and why should you get a watch from a young, upcoming but mostly unknown Swiss Brand? For us this is not about the fast money. If it comes over night that's of course ok for us. But the goal of our project is to create a sustainable watch brand, to offer quality, to learn and to improve with every new timepiece we create.
On the one hand, the Z&K automatic watches are the perfect introduction to the world of mechanical watches for watch newbies and on the other hand they are a great addition to the existing collection for watch enthusiasts.
And it is also the story of taking a once in a lifetime chance in order to realize a dream. This is how we came up with our slogan ""Time is YOURS!"".
Now we are back with our second watch the ZK No.2 a Swiss Made Automatic watch powered by a chronometer certified automatic movement. The watches are available in two versions: As a diver watch and as a GMT watch.
All designs you will see on this campaign page are limited to 50 pcs only! Each watch is numbered and will come with an official and numbered certification from the chronometer Institute in Le Locle, Switzerland.

 

HOW DOES THIS CAMPAIGN WORK?
The goal of this campaign is to ensure the production of ZK No.2. The campaign runs for a total of 40 days. The goal is to collect CHF 113'000.00 during this time, which means selling a little more than 100 watches.

Wenn du weiter runten scrollst, werden wir dir zuerst die Taucheruhr-Version der ZK No.2 und gleich danach die GMT-Version mit technischen Spezifikationen und Lieferumfang vorstellen.
 
WIE BESTELLE ICH EINE UHR?
Auf der rechten Seite dieses Fensters findest du unsere Angebote. Angefangen mit dem niedrigsten Preis für die Taucheruhr, gefolgt von den GMT's weiter unten. Die Angebote sind limitiert.

SWISS MADE AND CERTIFIED
What makes these watches really special, next to the super cool design, is the fact that the watches are powered by chronometer movements, which are certified by the COSC institute in Le Locle.
Less than <3% off all movements produced in Switzerland are chronometer certified. And each ZK No.2 comes with one of those.

As the name suggests, the COSC issues quality certificates for chronometers based on a standardized measuring procedure according to NIHS 95-11 / ISO 3159. This test of the movement lasts 15 days, during which the movement's rate is determined in five different positions at three temperatures.
Each movement certified by the COSC is individually numbered and will come with an official certificate.

RISKS AND CHALLENGES
If we would tell you that crowdfunding is without risks and easy, then this would be a lie. And believe us, we know what we are talking about. Unfortunately we had to overcome some obstacles in the past.
One year ago we tried to get the production of the ZK No.2 funded on Kickstarter. We did reach our funding goal but unfortunately we had to make a detour due to short-term adjustments from suppliers. Thats why we are back on Indiegogo to finally reach our goal. To do so we need to sell a little more than 100 additional watches. And thanks to your support we will get there.
So as you can see we allready went through the highest highs and the lowest lows. The biggest risk is that we are a small company and are depending on our suppliers. If they get an order from a big player, we for sure will be priority two, three or five. Means that there is always the risk of delays and changes in the schedule. But due to the fact that we are already experienced, we do not get into panic mode. We do adapt and keep going until we reach our goal. 
This is our lifetime dream and we do our very best that it comes true. And you know what? So far we allways delivered.
 
Thank you very much for your trust and your support!

Hello, my name is Hugo Ferraz, I have two children, and I am a Portuguese architect who is passionate about new concepts and ideas that contribute to improving the quality of life. That's why I've created in 2014 Ideas Forward, an international platform for ideas competitions.
 

 
Hello, my name is Sandra José. I am a mother of two, and I am an actress, playwright and music teacher. Art and creation have always been part of my life.

We realized early on that a lot of things brought us together, fell in love, and rebuilt our lives.Now we have a full house and have found the balance that only love can return.Professionally we have involved in many other projects. We have already edited a book, and continue to work as a team far beyond the affective field because we have learned to organize and separate emotions.With our dynamic professions, we felt the need to create a product that could meet the demands of our work.Shopping trips for such a large family, classes, shows, gym, trips, among many other activities, led us to think of a bag concept that could meet all our needs.









To realize our idea, we retrieved memories of the Portuguese fishing tradition, which materialized in a contemporary object of global use.The personalized organization, simple access, and adaptable accessories creatively.SAKO has a minimal design and sturdy materials, inspired by the Portuguese coastal tradition, where the image of boats is admittedly present in a graphic reinterpretation that values the culture of a people.
 


Each will carry a little of our history on their shoulders to create their own.SAKO is a 100% product produced in Portugal.
 










When the campaign ends on October 31st, will be sent to the backers a voucher of their purchase if they want do offer on Christmas.

Some unforeseen situations, such as strikes, customs problems, or delays that are not up to us, may delay the delivery of SAKO. We have already contemplated a time that can predict all of these delays, but sometimes they may be a little longer than what we accounted. We will try, however, to follow the dispatches and to communicate the delivery to each sponsor.

In April 2019, we successfully funded the Nighthawk jacket on both Kickstarter & Indiegogo. After a year of being interrupted by the global pandemic, we are back stronger and ready to bring you something more exciting.
There are countless jackets on crowdfunding platforms that packed with features that customers might or might not need. However we have not come across one single product that is not only functional, but actually fashionable & stylish (i.e. look good).
We decide to change that.
Introducing Stormbender. Designed for city dwellers & travellers who want the extreme versatility, essential utility & waterproof performance, with the best fashionable style possible.


 
Design Thoughts
State-of-the-art storm-bending waterproof performance for all weather conditions, exceptional insulation to keep you warm and protected from the elements.
 

 
Water repellent zippers with additional button-front pad for enhanced storm-seal.
  
 
Skin-like vegan friendly fabric #SynTech, carefully designed at its weight-class to achieve the perfect balance between the best possible waterproof performance and insulation while maintaining a lightweight body for ease-of-carry by city dwellers or outdoor travellers.



 
Convertible extension side zippers to switch between slim fit & lose fit, for freedom of style & comfort of movement.

 

Perfect coat length to strike the balance between style, coverage & comfort of movement.
 

Choose between Bright or Dark Prints: choose between subtly designed reflective bright prints (for enhanced visibility in low light condition):

And dark-print to represent your own classy & understated style:
 
 Essential #ZL signature NFC card pockets for super easy payment during commute.All zippered pockets for maximum security of your daily essentialsRemovable hood for freedom to switch between coat styles   Thoughtfully tailored fit & design for both men and women.

<h2>Story</h2>
<p>The first wallets were innovated shortly after the creation of paper currency in the 1600s. Since then, man has been slipping wallets into their pockets. For men who want to strike up a conversation with a brand-new style of wallet and carry their necessities in a new way, Vesper Wallet has been designed. </p>
<p>The fresh Vesper Wallet breathes new life into a design that has been outdated for years. Men have been spending money on wallets, only to put their money into their wallets and into their back pocket. With the Vesper Wallet, men can still carry their wallets in their back pockets if they choose. If they want something a little different, the all-new Vesper Wallet offers an exciting option. </p>
<p>The Vesper Wallet is designed to fit into a suit chest pocket and gives the appearance of being a pocket square. To other people, the wallet looks like an accessory of the suit - only the person carrying the wallet knows the truth. The Vesper Wallet offers high quality craftsmanship, premium materials, and a sleek appearance. It also makes for an interesting conversation piece and fashion statement.</p>

Our goal is to simplify daily tasks for users
of our products and ideas to make them happier. This goal was the original
driver behind our first product Travel-C. Travel-C is smart and simple contact
lens container like no other product currently on the market. The product is
designed to transport contact lenses as well as a cleaning solution in one
compact container. The inconvenient need for carrying around large cleaning
solution bottles or the limitations of container size restrictions due to air
travel regulations is now a thing of the past (more details can be found in our
product video or on our homepage). <p></p>
<p></p>
<p>It is important that such products are produced
and tested to the highest standards to be able to guarantee top quality and a
safe application. For us to be able to guarantee this quality and safety, we
require a medical accreditation (RL 93/42MDD and FDA), which we can only achieve with
your help. Obviously, for you to have some fun investing and also see a return,
we would be honored to give you the opportunity to be one of the first users of
this new and innovative product – Travel-C! All you have to do is to support us.
Thank you!<br/><br/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FMlPIe3AYAKs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DMlPIe3AYAKs&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FMlPIe3AYAKs%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><h3></h3><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441698429/ov9qoptmjbhoms8ubgos.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><br/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">THE TRAVEL-C IN PINK &amp; BLUE </h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433078048/vkrksepsjoclf2iekstv.gif"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444047887/i5kw8ji2ahd2ybgbrlm9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">

<strong><br/>Situation 1</strong><p>Hello, my name is Steve and I am from
Miami. Today, two of my best friends and I decided to spontaneously go to New
York City over the weekend. We will be visiting my cousin Jonathan who just
became a father of triplets. I am certain that Jonathan will take care of us
and thus don’t need to bring a lot of items on my trip. All I will have to
bring is a backpack, which will go through as a carry-on on my flight. Now I am
ready, my friends are already waiting in front of my house. I’m just checking
my bag one last time to make sure I packed everything and fortunately I saw
that I forgot to pack my contact lens solution.</p><p>
On
the way to the airport I get upset because I just thought of the fact that I
can’t bring my contact lens solution bottle onto the flight because the bottle
is too large. As we know, travelers are only allowed to bring bottles with a
maximum content of 100 ml per bottle and unfortunately my bottle contains three
times that volume. My friends see that I am upset and ask me for the reason. I
explain my frustration and Michael replied with a smile: “Just this morning I
bought myself the new Travel-C, which is a device to combine both contact
lenses and contact lens solution in a small and compact container. Thus, allowing
you to take it with you anywhere you go.” In the mean time even Marcel got his
new Travel-C out of his bag to rub it in my face. I elusively watch them how
they pose with their product and how they make fun of me. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441274933/gfjw6ur7uacz1ygqorws.png"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong></strong></p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444048030/kmpdnts9qdyalfhdvtfc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p><p></p>
<strong><br/>Situation 2</strong><br/>Hello my name is Amanda and I am from
England. I am somewhat messy. I always forget things and often act without
thinking. This personality trade has already ended in many disasters. However,
this is who I am and my friends and family love me for that.<p></p><p>I have been wearing contacts for about two
years now. I also travel a lot and obviously need to take my contacts with me
anywhere I go and with my contacts I also have to carry a contact lens
container as well as the solution to clean my contacts.</p>
<p>Since
this morning I am officially on vacation in Spain to visit one of my good
friends. We just spent a phenomenal day together but now I am just exhausted
and ready to go to bed. Obviously, I won’t forget to take out my contacts and
so I unpack my contact lens solution and am looking for my container. It is
unbelievable but again, I most have forgotten my contact lens container at
home. This is now the third time this year. My friend goes and gets her purse
to show me this thing that looks like lipstick. With a questionable look on my
face I open the lipstick just to realize that it is not a lipstick – it is
actually a contact lens container in combination with a compartment for contact
lens solution. Simply genius. On the stick I see a label called: Travel-C!</p>

About a year ago I became an entrepreneur and thus I am traveling for my
start-up all the time. My business partner Sam is with me for most of these
travels. Today, Sam and I are currently in London and we sit in some
comfortable armchairs in the lobby of a large enterprise
waiting for our sales pitch to start. Sam is scratching his eyes and it looks
to me like he is incredibly nervous and doesn’t feel well.</p>
<p>Sam mumbles: “My contacts itch. I think due
to the flight my contacts kind of tried up.” </p>
<p>

I
suggest taking the contacts out and just wearing his glasses. Sam response and
says: I can’t – where would I put my contacts in the meantime – like anybody
would carry around a contact lens container and the contact lens solution at
all times.” With my right hand I grab into my jacket pocket and show him the
most compact contact lens container ever invented. Travel-C is exactly the
solution for Sam’s problem. One product that Sam can use in situations
precisely like the one his in right now.<br/></p>

<p>Unser Ziel ist es, mit unseren Ideen und Produkten den menschlichen Alltag zu vereinfachen und damit die Anwender unserer Produkte glücklicher zu machen. Deshalb haben wir den Travel-C entwickelt. Der Travel-C ist so smart und einfach wie kein anderes Linsenprodukt. Dieses Produkt ist für das Transportieren von Kontaktlinsen auf Reisen konzipiert worden. Ein lästiges Schleppen von grossen Linsenflaschen oder die Limitierung von Flüssigkeiten für Flugzeugreisen gehören mit dem Travel-C der Vergangenheit an (genauere Details finden Sie in unseren Videos oder auf unserer Homepage). Es ist aber wichtig das solche Produkte nach höchsten Standards geprüft und gefertigt werden, um ein hohe Qualität und ein sicheres Anwenden garantieren zu können. Für diese Qualität benötigen wir eine medizinische Zulassung nach der RL 93/42MDD und FDA die wir nur mit eurer Hilfe erreichen können. Damit das Investieren in diese Projekt auch spass macht und euch auch was bringt, möchten wir euch die Gelegenheit geben die ersten Benutzer dieses genialen Produkts sein zu dürfen.

WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR



Our goal is to simplify daily tasks for users
of our products and ideas to make them happier. This goal was the original
driver behind our first product Travel-C. Travel-C is smart and simple contact
lens container like no other product currently on the market. The product is
designed to transport contact lenses as well as a cleaning solution in one
compact container. The inconvenient need for carrying around large cleaning
solution bottles or the limitations of container size restrictions due to air
travel regulations is now a thing of the past (more details can be found in our
product video or on our homepage). 

It is important that such products are produced
and tested to the highest standards to be able to guarantee top quality and a
safe application. For us to be able to guarantee this quality and safety, we
require a medical accreditation (RL 93/42MDD and FDA), which we can only achieve with
your help. Obviously, for you to have some fun investing and also see a return,
we would be honored to give you the opportunity to be one of the first users of
this new and innovative product – Travel-C! All you have to do is to support us.
Thank you!THE TRAVEL-C IN PINK & BLUE

Situation 1Hello, my name is Steve and I am from
Miami. Today, two of my best friends and I decided to spontaneously go to New
York City over the weekend. We will be visiting my cousin Jonathan who just
became a father of triplets. I am certain that Jonathan will take care of us
and thus don’t need to bring a lot of items on my trip. All I will have to
bring is a backpack, which will go through as a carry-on on my flight. Now I am
ready, my friends are already waiting in front of my house. I’m just checking
my bag one last time to make sure I packed everything and fortunately I saw
that I forgot to pack my contact lens solution.
On
the way to the airport I get upset because I just thought of the fact that I
can’t bring my contact lens solution bottle onto the flight because the bottle
is too large. As we know, travelers are only allowed to bring bottles with a
maximum content of 100 ml per bottle and unfortunately my bottle contains three
times that volume. My friends see that I am upset and ask me for the reason. I
explain my frustration and Michael replied with a smile: “Just this morning I
bought myself the new Travel-C, which is a device to combine both contact
lenses and contact lens solution in a small and compact container. Thus, allowing
you to take it with you anywhere you go.” In the mean time even Marcel got his
new Travel-C out of his bag to rub it in my face. I elusively watch them how
they pose with their product and how they make fun of me. 
Situation 2Hello my name is Amanda and I am from
England. I am somewhat messy. I always forget things and often act without
thinking. This personality trade has already ended in many disasters. However,
this is who I am and my friends and family love me for that.I have been wearing contacts for about two
years now. I also travel a lot and obviously need to take my contacts with me
anywhere I go and with my contacts I also have to carry a contact lens
container as well as the solution to clean my contacts.
Since
this morning I am officially on vacation in Spain to visit one of my good
friends. We just spent a phenomenal day together but now I am just exhausted
and ready to go to bed. Obviously, I won’t forget to take out my contacts and
so I unpack my contact lens solution and am looking for my container. It is
unbelievable but again, I most have forgotten my contact lens container at
home. This is now the third time this year. My friend goes and gets her purse
to show me this thing that looks like lipstick. With a questionable look on my
face I open the lipstick just to realize that it is not a lipstick – it is
actually a contact lens container in combination with a compartment for contact
lens solution. Simply genius. On the stick I see a label called: Travel-C!
Situation 3Hello my name is Peter and I am from Switzerland.
About a year ago I became an entrepreneur and thus I am traveling for my
start-up all the time. My business partner Sam is with me for most of these
travels. Today, Sam and I are currently in London and we sit in some
comfortable armchairs in the lobby of a large enterprise
waiting for our sales pitch to start. Sam is scratching his eyes and it looks
to me like he is incredibly nervous and doesn’t feel well.
Sam mumbles: “My contacts itch. I think due
to the flight my contacts kind of tried up.” 


I
suggest taking the contacts out and just wearing his glasses. Sam response and
says: I can’t – where would I put my contacts in the meantime – like anybody
would carry around a contact lens container and the contact lens solution at
all times.” With my right hand I grab into my jacket pocket and show him the
most compact contact lens container ever invented. Travel-C is exactly the
solution for Sam’s problem. One product that Sam can use in situations
precisely like the one his in right now.

WAS WIR WOLLEN



Unser Ziel ist es, mit unseren Ideen und Produkten den menschlichen Alltag zu vereinfachen und damit die Anwender unserer Produkte glücklicher zu machen. Deshalb haben wir den Travel-C entwickelt. Der Travel-C ist so smart und einfach wie kein anderes Linsenprodukt. Dieses Produkt ist für das Transportieren von Kontaktlinsen auf Reisen konzipiert worden. Ein lästiges Schleppen von grossen Linsenflaschen oder die Limitierung von Flüssigkeiten für Flugzeugreisen gehören mit dem Travel-C der Vergangenheit an (genauere Details finden Sie in unseren Videos oder auf unserer Homepage). Es ist aber wichtig das solche Produkte nach höchsten Standards geprüft und gefertigt werden, um ein hohe Qualität und ein sicheres Anwenden garantieren zu können. Für diese Qualität benötigen wir eine medizinische Zulassung nach der RL 93/42MDD und FDA die wir nur mit eurer Hilfe erreichen können. Damit das Investieren in diese Projekt auch spass macht und euch auch was bringt, möchten wir euch die Gelegenheit geben die ersten Benutzer dieses genialen Produkts sein zu dürfen. Alles was ihr tun müsst ist uns zu unterstützen. Herzlichen Dank!

<h3>Lighting</h3>
<p>The Reef Monster's lighting provides a number of different color variations by allowing you to control the brightness and temperature of the lights. Through a combination of these two elements you are able to create the perfect conditions for your aquarium and an atmosphere that suits your aquarium's needs.</p>
<p>The Reef Monster's lighting is 50% more efficient than traditional aquarium lighting because it uses a 168-watt Cree LED lighting array.</p>

<p><b>Q. What type of data is the Reef Monster collecting about my aquarium?</b></p>
<p>A. The Dokdo Tank is able to collect data about your aquarium’s temperature, pH, ORP, DO, and nitrates. This information is only collected if you have the appropriate sensor connected to the Reef Monster.</p>
<p><b>Q. What tools are required to put the Dokdo Tank together?</b></p>
<p>A. No tools are required to put the Dokdo Tank together. The users manual will provide all the instructions you need to setup your smart aquarium.</p>
<p><b>Q. What types of fish can live in the Dokdo Tank?</b></p>
<p>A. The Dokdo Tank supports fish and other organisms for both fresh water and saltwater.</p>
<p><b>Q. How often do I need to change components/materials in the Dokdo Tank?</b></p>
<p>A. The only thing that needs to be replaced in the Dokdo Tank is the activated carbon. Changing the activated carbon once every month will keep your water clean by absorbing out impurities preventing cloudiness. With the 1 kg of activated carbon included in the Dokdo Tank’s standard package will last up to a year.<br/>Adding one bacteria ample per month will provide the highest water quality.</p>
<p><b>Q. When do I have to change the water in my Dokdo Tank?</b></p>
<p>A. We designed the Dokdo Tank to change water less frequently, but simply add water to the supply box when needed. Under some circumstances, such as beginners who only wish to start with a few fish and live rock/coral, there is no need to change the water. Since water evaporates you will need to add 1-2 liters of water daily to the water supply box located on the top of the System Sump. the system has an embedded ATO reservoir and can top up evaporated water automatically. For the best results, changing the water by 10-15% once a month is recommended, but not required.</p>
<p><b>Q. What if I need a replacement part for my Dokdo Tank?</b></p>
<p>A. We’re working on a warranty
plan for the Dokdo Tank and will provide an update once we have a warranty to
share. In the mean time you may contact us with any problems or issues you
have.</p>
<p><b>Q. How is the Dokdo Tank different from other aquariums?</b></p>
<p>A. The Dokdo Tank is an all-in-one
unit. What do we mean by “all-in-one?”</p>
<p> *  Everything you need to get started comes in the box</p>
<p>*  There’s no need to buy any other pieces of equipment</p>
<p>*  We provide a free application to help you monitor your aquarium</p>
<p>The Dokdo Tank was made for any person with no experience to a lot  of experience to be able to use right away with no other components necessary. Although the sensors will provide the highest quality of ease and simplicity through the use of our app, the comprehensive manual will provide instructions and planned settings for the Dokdo Tank to provide a thriving marine ecosystem without the sensors.<br/></p>
<p><b>Q. What else do I need to use the Dokdo Tank?</b></p>
<p> A. Depending on the type of aquarium (fresh or salt) and fish you want to have changes the needs for any fish/living organisms. The manual included in the box will help you make such choices and you may customize your tank to the way you prefer with decorations such as rock or sand with the best outcomes for your the environment you wish to have.Most fish tend to live in temperature conditions ranging from 20 to 30 degrees Celsius (68 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit), therefore, owner's who live in harsher conditions of heat or cold in their home may need to have a heating or cooling system to match such conditions.</p>
<p><b>Q. How many fish can I have in my Dokdo Tank?</b></p>
<p>A. As seen in the video above, the Dokdo Tank was capable of breeding 200 clown fish for 2 years showing the efficiency and capacity of its filtration system, however, as fish get bigger, Darwin's theory of the survival of the fittest takes place and the smaller/weaker fish will inevitably start to be out competed by larger fish as is true in nature. Therefore, the recommended capacity of fish for is 10 for them to strive and survive for a long healthy life. </p>
<p><b>Q. How to keep my Dokdo Tank clean and functioning properly?</b></p>
<p> A. The only manual labor that is needed to keep the Dokdo Tank clean is emptying out the collection cup for the protein skimmer once a week and  wiping down the algae build-up on the glass for visibility (leaving the algae on the glass may be undesirably for visuals, but it is actually good for your fish tank so wipe at your own discretion!)</p>
<p><b>Q. How do I set up the Dokdo Tank?</b></p>
<p> 1) Open the box and take out the parts<br/>
2) Connect the Reef Monster and System Sump together<br/>
3) Place the sand and desired decorations (live rock, etc.) into the tank<br/>
4) Gently add the water to the tank so the sand and decorations stay put then    <br/>     turn the return motor.<br/>
5) Add the bacteria ample into the tank's water then turn on the LED lighting once<br/>     every 8 hours.<br/>
6) Wait 2 weeks until adding any fish into the tank<br/>
7) Choose which environment you want to have and you are all set!
<br/></p><p></p></div>","The Dokdo Tank is a unique experience in owning a personal aquarium.
The Dokdo Tank includes all the necessary equipment and features needed to setup, maintain, and enjoy an aquarium in your home without all the inconveniences and hassles of traditional aquariums.



The Dokdo Tank was designed to be a ""smart"" aquarium. What do we mean by ""smart?""Smart means we use technology to take the hassle out of managing your aquarium. Using an internet connection you're able to monitor your tank, set schedules, and manage your aquarium's environment from the Dokdo Tank mobile application.It is a contained ecosystem that can be managed and maintained with just a few adjustments to the water level and filtration. The smart capability allows for a fun and easier way to stay updated on your aquarium.The best part about the Dokdo Tank is that everything is included in the box. There's no need to buy parts and equipment from various vendors; Dokdo Tank has it covered.

               The video below shows a 2 year timespan for            which 200 clown fish were born and bred in the                                        Dokdo Tank. 
 This is a school of clown fish being raised in the Dokdo Tank over a two-year period, and the water in the aquarium was never changed. We just added water when necessary to the water supply box, added activated carbon once a month and 1 bacteria ampule once a month.Want to know more about how the Dokdo Tank can do this? The following sections provide a bit more information to help you understand why the Dokdo Tank is a ""smart"" aquarium.The system sump was designed for an easier and simpler way to keep and maintain your aquarium's filtration system. All you have to do is occasionally pull out the filtration media, dump, rinse then place it back where it was. Refilling the filtration media is also as simple as taking it out, filling it up, then placing it back!The Dokdo Tank's System Sump uses three types of filtration: biological, physical, and chemical. Below is an overview of each filtration system used in the System Sump.
Biological Filtration
 There are good bacteria and bad bacteria in aquariums. The purpose of the System Sump is to make sure that the bad bacteria are removed while allowing the good bacteria to thrive.The System Sump uses porous filter media and bacteria amplifiers to achieve biological filtration. Want to know more about the porous filter media and bacteria amplifiers? Just look below.



Prodibio Startup amplifiers help fish adapt quickly when new water is added to the Dokdo Tank or when you first setup your Dokdo Tank. These amplifiers contain over 50 billion good bacteria that help your fish survive in their new environment.



 




Substrat Pro is developed by EHEIM, and is a top of the line biological filter. The filter helps break down excrement while allowing organic matter to pass through. A surface area of 450m2 per liter enables countless bacteria to live inside your aquarium and help it stay clean.



 



Physical Filtration



 


The System Sump also uses a nano-protein skimmer to create lots of tiny bubbles.  Our patented technology improves upon the traditional spike impeller by producing a greater amount of nano-bubbles.
The benefits of these improvements allows your aquarium's water to be more fully aerated and causes more impurities to be filtered out of your aquarium.
However, when using fresh water in the Dokdo Tank, the nano-protein skimmer is only able to provide aeration for your aquarium but not any form of physical filtration.




Chemical Filtration



Using activated carbon, the System Sump's chemical filtration process is able to keep the aquarium's water transparent and clear by removing impurities from the water. Chemical filtration through activated carbon also helps to remove any bad smells from the aquarium by eliminating unwanted and possibly toxic bacteria.









Managing aquariums comfortably through biological, physical, and chemical filtration raises the survival rate of living organisms by maintaining optimal water quality.

Don't forget that all the filtration needed for the Dokdo Tank is included!








Lighting
The Reef Monster's lighting provides a number of different color variations by allowing you to control the brightness and temperature of the lights. Through a combination of these two elements you are able to create the perfect conditions for your aquarium and an atmosphere that suits your aquarium's needs.
The Reef Monster's lighting is 50% more efficient than traditional aquarium lighting because it uses a 168-watt Cree LED lighting array.








Because of the Cree lighting array, you are able to adjust the Reef Monster's lights between 5,000 to 20,000 Kelvin. This enables you to create a natural lighting environment similar to the one found in various depths of the world's oceans. 








▲ Displays the various light wavelengths the Reef Monster can generate across the color spectrum to suit your aquarium's specific needs.


▲ Adjusting the lights using motion with the Dokdo Tank Mobile App



The TIR lenses used in the Reef Monster offer enhanced permeability. These lenses further diffuse the LEDs, enhancing the lighting to a more natural state.

The Reef Monster's Cooling System



The Reef Monster uses a heat dissipation system that expels hot air while it simultaneously intakes cool air from the outside.

Monitoring and Management

The Dokdo Tank is ""smart"" because of the technology built into the Reef Monster. With an optional sensor (up to 5 may be connected at a time) you can monitor and manage your aquarium's temperature, pH (acidity), ORP (oxidation reduction potential), DO (dissolved oxygen), and nitrates.

<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>We’re two guys with a passion for motorcycling. Two guys that happen to have experience with design, rapid prototyping, technology and a need for speed. </p>
<p>Rewind to 2004. Bill and Sumner are both licking wounds from ending relationships and become roommates in an industrial loft space in the heart of San Francisco’s SOMA. Sumner had a bike. Bill didn’t. Not someone to sit around, it didn’t take Bill long to change that.</p>
<p>Their first build wasn’t planned at all. Bill got his hands on an early model Kawasaki ZX7 that Sumner purchased back in the 90s. The bike was used for city transportation mainly and it quickly became a crime statistic after it “grew feet” and disappeared on one fateful evening. While dismayed and disappointed, Bill found solace in a replacement bike only to have to bike returned as a theft recovery months later. Gone was the perfect bodywork, the ignition had been punched out and the bike had never seen worse days.</p>
<p>Fast forward a couple of years to Sumner’s garage and the ZX-7 has been collecting dust. Bill has an idea for a naked urban sportbike and Sumner starts working on it. When the two realize that there was no elegant way to chop the tail using the existing subframe and factory parts -- Bill set off to design a one-off futuristic seat that would replace the stock seat and heavy tail section of the ZX-7. Huge MOTO was beginning to take shape and the innovative features of the Kawasaki would later be highlighted online by many websites. Here’s where the demand and research began. </p>
<p>The next build would be approached with a more refined methodology. With an eye on sales numbers (we’d only look at bikes readily available on the secondary market), the search for a modern sportbike with an attractive frame and engine began. The Honda CBR turned out to be the perfect platform to build on. It has the beautifully engineered frame, a hundred and sixty horsepower, and available ABS. Bill dove into the bike’s design even going as far as completely modeling the entire bike in CAD. The fit and finish are factory-level and create a custom bike that looks and feels like it came of the Honda assembly line.</p>

Before being the co-founder of a successful design consultancy in San Francisco, Bill worked as creative director for one of the top design firms, collaborating with some of the biggest consumer electronics brands and boldest tech startups to deliver award-winning product design.

<p>FAQ:</p>
<p><b>What is Blango made of? </b>Our
 blankets are made of fleece fabric. This material is generally 
lightweight yet breathable, which means air can flow through easily. It 
is often preferred over wool because it's lighter.
 Also people may find themselves becoming itchy when they wear wool, but
 usually don’t have such a reaction to wearing garments made from this 
handmade type of textile.</p>
<p><b>What size do you have?</b> One size fits all. We decided to go for one size but don’t rule out other sizes in the future. We’d like to see what the demands are and based on that we will make new sizes. </p>
<p><b>Is the Blango unisex?</b> Yes, it's for both men and women. </p>
<p><b>Will there be other colors in the future?</b> Yes</p>
<p><b>When can we expect our Blango's?</b> We have put september
 for our first backers as delivery date. But we strongly believe this 
can be sooner. We will work our best to make it faster.</p>
<b>Are you planning on making changes in the future?</b> We’re always looking for new challenges and ways to innovate in order to make things more comfortable for our costumers. We definitely hope to bring new ideas in the future<p></p>

</div></div>","Introducing The Blango a supersoft blanket with loose sleeves and feet pocket. A lightweight, but warm fleece blanket.
One
 day a friend of mine came to me and said he would really love to have a
 blanket that he could wear and walk around in. One that keeps him warm 
and gives him mobility. So after searching the blanket market, we came 
to the conclusion that the current wearable blankets did not meet those 
requirements. We had a few other people try the blankets and they came 
to us with the same complaints. They wanted their feet and back to be 
warm but they also wanted to walk around in it.       So we changed and improved the design and came up with The Blango.We made sure you retain the use of your hands while walking and that The Blango would not drop from your shoulders once you lean forward and, finally, that your feet are warm and cosy.With an easy to use button system, our blanket gives you 100% freedom to  walk aroundIt
 was not that easy to find a way to move while still retaining the use 
of your hands. We didn't want that people would feel like they are 
dragging around this lump of cloth in order to move. We want you to 
still be able to hold on things while moving. Our button system gives 
you this opportunity.                          Your feet are kept warm in a comfy pocket.The Feet pocket is very comfy and it keeps the feet enjoyably warm.We’ve encountered the problem of cold feet when sitting behind the desk, working
 on this project. Everywhere, except the feet, was nicely covered and 
warm. We know there are a lot of people who work at home night or day 
for many hours. Winter can be very cold and especially the closer you 
are near the ground the colder it gets                                 Your neck is completely covered. This feature is one of my favorites, nothing feels better than the feeling of warmth around your neck.  Why you should try our product: Your hands are free to read a book on your porch or while working on the computer or tablet behind  your desk. Take your Blango with you to the beach where you can watch the sunset in total warmth.You can take it with you on Ski holidays and drink your hot chocolate milk outside next to a campfire!

<h3>Our Leather</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<strong>We use only full grain vegetable tanned leather</strong> it's the most expensive 
leather as it is made from the top layer of the cow hide. It does not 
have a synthetic leather coating (as usual in cheaper leathers). It 
retains all of the texture of the original hide and is therefore 
flexible and more durable.
<p><b>This also means that each piece of leather is unique as unique will be every our single product we'll deliver to you.</b> <br/></p>
<p>Vegetable
 tanning is an artisan tradition and deeply rooted for generations from 
our tuscan leather tannery. Our leathers come exclusively from a tannery
 that belongs to ""The Genuine Italian Vegetable-Tanned Leather 
Consortium""  founded in 1994 by eleven Tuscan tanneries. <br/></p>
<p><b><a href=""http://www.pellealvegetale.it/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Consortium Website</a></b><br/></p>
<p><b>Through this 
consortium we can give you the best vegetable tanned leather.</b><br/></p>
<p>Nearly forty days are actually needed to transform raw hides into unique vegetable-tanned leathers. All the cowhides we use are a by-product of the food industry.<br/>Vegetable-tanned
 leather absorbs the traces of our living, it matures, gets softer and 
darker depending on your lifestyle and how you use your product. The 
natural ageing does not compromise its resistance and gives it a vintage
 look with warm colour shades showing evidence of being a natural 
product.</p>
<p><b>We love it and we think you will too.</b></p>
<h3>Our Wool Felt</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We source the different types of wool we use in our products from all over Europe. <br/></p>
<p><strong>100% wool, whether it's woven or felt.</strong><strong> <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>It gives protection with a soft touch.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>

 We love real leather… 

 We love “the way we used to do things”… 

 We love Italian craftsmanship…




These four points led us to create goods for the present with an eye to the past. We want to create 
products that give feelings, we leave to others the cold synthetic, it’s
 not our world, we want the charm of nature, we want to catch your eyes.
We are Wolecraft
And here below our latest product:

| Byron |















The most organized way to carry.


Byron is a customizable carryall designed to satisfy the needs of
a diverse range of lifestyles and professions thanks to magnetic
spines that accommodate modular Inserts. Byron includes the Insert of your
choice designed for unique storage needs. The interior of the Byron includes organization for tablet, phone,
pens, glasses, cards, cash, notebook, small items, open compartments,
and cords. 
Clean and minimal lines. The finest materials. The best craftsmanship. The right price without any intermediate passage. 
From us to you.
This is what we believe in.




Our Leather






We use only full grain vegetable tanned leather it's the most expensive 
leather as it is made from the top layer of the cow hide. It does not 
have a synthetic leather coating (as usual in cheaper leathers). It 
retains all of the texture of the original hide and is therefore 
flexible and more durable.
This also means that each piece of leather is unique as unique will be every our single product we'll deliver to you. 
Vegetable
 tanning is an artisan tradition and deeply rooted for generations from 
our tuscan leather tannery. Our leathers come exclusively from a tannery
 that belongs to ""The Genuine Italian Vegetable-Tanned Leather 
Consortium""  founded in 1994 by eleven Tuscan tanneries. 
Consortium Website
Through this 
consortium we can give you the best vegetable tanned leather.
Nearly forty days are actually needed to transform raw hides into unique vegetable-tanned leathers. All the cowhides we use are a by-product of the food industry.Vegetable-tanned
 leather absorbs the traces of our living, it matures, gets softer and 
darker depending on your lifestyle and how you use your product. The 
natural ageing does not compromise its resistance and gives it a vintage
 look with warm colour shades showing evidence of being a natural 
product.
We love it and we think you will too.
Our Wool Felt

We source the different types of wool we use in our products from all over Europe. 
100% wool, whether it's woven or felt. 
It gives protection with a soft touch.





There are two different Inserts you can choose. 
The Travel Insert and the Everyday Insert.
Every Insert can be used separately from the main body. Take off your insert, fold it and fix it with the elastic band on the side. In 10 seconds you have a smaller carryall at your service.

Well let us tell you how we’re going to do it!         For over 2 years, we have been perfecting our concept and designing the two collections we are offering our supporters and the fellow Indiegogo community today.We take our inspiration from everywhere, but we didn't want to be like other watch companies in the sense that they want to 'change the watch industry by making things cheaper'. We focus on creating the perfect experience, using high quality materials and providing our customers with a high quality timepiece that they can genuinely wear for years and never get bored of. We'd be lying if we said it had been easy. Juggling our day jobs with staying up until 3 in the morning most nights, just to get things done. Scott ended up saving money he was spending on rent, to move back home and sleep on his parents couch, just so he had money to help fund refined prototypes  so we could get the end product as perfect as humanly possible.        With a focus on quality and precision throughout our design process, we partnered directly with world leading manufacturers who have experience hand crafting timepieces for some of the most prestigious watch companies in the world. From the first time we contacted them, it took us over a year for them to actually take us seriously. But after pestering them with phone calls and countless emails, we managed to get them on board.Emerton Scott watches are crafted from the highest grade of stainless steel on the market, ensuring maximum durability and a long lasting polish that will stand the test of time. Each collection has been specifically designed to fit perfectly on any wrist, to ensure the upmost comfort whilst worn.Reserving your watch isn't a purchase; it is an investment. Upon placing your order, your watch will be handmade by an expert watch maker and then engraved with your unique message on the rear casing of your watch.Each and every watch is individually quality checked once crafted. Once it has passed all required tests, it will be packaged and sent directly to you.We're so confident in the fact you'll love your Emerton Scott, if it arrives and you don't like it, we'll give you a full refund straight away.We've worked far too hard on delivering these two new collections and thinking about every little aspect of  making your experience as enjoyable as possible.  For anyone who is new to crowd funding or just wants to know why it's been so popular the last few years.

<h2>The Problem: </h2>
<p>Noise-induced hearing loss is on the rise as our world grows louder. </p>
<p>Concerts, sports events, races and even the workplace can expose us to unsafe noise hazards, loud enough to require hearing protection. There’s one problem, the options for cool, fun, and safe hearing protection are few and far between, and no earplugs allow for customization. </p>
<p>This is where OTOGEAR comes in:</p>

<h2>Our Product</h2>
<p>OTOGEAR is a patent pending modern earplug attachment that is changing the face of hearing protection. OTOGEAR's are fully customizable and interchangeable, allowing you to style your hearing protection for any occasion.

<p>OTOGEAR’s goal is to provide a fun and safe listening experience.

<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p><a href=""http://otogear.net/2017/02/22/1-1-billion-people-at-risk-of-hearing-loss-who-highlights-serious-threat-posed-by-exposure-to-recreational-noise/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">According to the World Health Organization, more than 1 billion people worldwide are at risk of noise-induced hearing loss.</a> Noise-induced hearing loss is preventable with hearing protection, yet there is a negative stigma that deters people from wearing protection. To get rid of the stigma, you must find a way to make hearing protection easy, accessible, affordable, fun, and cool to wear.</p>
<p>By making hearing protection stylish the negative stigma of wearing earplugs at concerts and the risk of noise-induced hearing loss will decrease. OTOGEAR makes hearing protection an extension of one’s personality rather than an eyesore.  Our dream is to create the next generation of hearing protection users.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>How Do They Work?</h2>
<p>OTOGEAR's are easy to assemble. Just slip the included earplug into the cavity inside the OTOGEAR. Push until earplug is fully inserted into the OTOGEAR. Once OTOGEAR's have earplugs inserted, you no longer have to handle the earplugs. Making it a more sanitary way to insert and take out hearing protection. </p>

<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>There are always a few risks and challenges in creating a new, innovative product.</p>
<p>First, finding a U.S. based manufacturing facility so that we could oversee the production and quality of our OTOGEAR attachments was extremely important to us, even if it meant that our production cost would be slightly higher. We are proud to say that OTOGEAR attachments are Made in America! Our manufacturers are located in Vancouver, WA - less than 15 minutes away from our headquarters!</p>

<p>Second, we searched high and low to find the right fabricator to source the hearing protection (ear plugs) included with each pair of OTOGEARs. Not only did we find high-quality earplugs that meet multiple safety organization standards, they are comfortable and reusable!</p>
<p>Third, Education! Turning around the negative stigma of wearing hearing protection and educating the public on hearing loss prevention is necessary. People of all ages are at risk of developing hearing loss due to unsafe, repeated exposure to damaging sound levels from personal audio devices, noisy sporting events, entertainment venues, construction and industry. Hearing loss can be prevented and that’s where OTOGEAR can help by making hearing protection safe, fun and fashionable. </p>

</ul><h2><u>Project Risks and Challenges</u></h2><p>There are 2 main issues that may cause delays.</p><p>1. Shipping Delays - As the shipment is being sent over by sea, we may incur delays should there be unaccounted weather, or if there are delays with any of the shipping routes. Also, in the unlikely event that the cargo is damaged, we may run into unforeseen delays as we work through resupplying the bags.  To ensure we minimize the chances of these unlikely events, we are working with the most reliable and largest shipping companies who are fully committed to timely delivery. </p><p>2. Manufacturing Delays - We may run into delays if our suppliers are in a short supply of the specified materials required for both the vegan leather and recycled polyester. As well, we may run into manufacturing delays in the case of an unforeseen spike in demand. To go around this, we'll do our best well in advance than the recommended date to have the bags delivered on time.</p><p>If any issues should arise, we will note them with you at the earliest time possible, and we'll always keep you in the loop. </p></div>","Our N1 backpack intertwines contemporary design cues with technical and sustainable materials. Made for the Modern Commuter, and Designed for All-Weather.  Our StoryThe majority of technical bags in the market have niche consumers in mind.

Project Risks and ChallengesThere are 2 main issues that may cause delays.1. Shipping Delays - As the shipment is being sent over by sea, we may incur delays should there be unaccounted weather, or if there are delays with any of the shipping routes. Also, in the unlikely event that the cargo is damaged, we may run into unforeseen delays as we work through resupplying the bags.  To ensure we minimize the chances of these unlikely events, we are working with the most reliable and largest shipping companies who are fully committed to timely delivery. 2. Manufacturing Delays - We may run into delays if our suppliers are in a short supply of the specified materials required for both the vegan leather and recycled polyester. As well, we may run into manufacturing delays in the case of an unforeseen spike in demand. To go around this, we'll do our best well in advance than the recommended date to have the bags delivered on time.If any issues should arise, we will note them with you at the earliest time possible, and we'll always keep you in the loop.",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHY WE NEED YOU</strong></p>
<p>Over the past year, we have worked all hours available developing, testing and improving the Eco One. This campaign was launched in the hope we can reach our goals and really bring the product to life. Your kind pledges will go towards:</p>
<p>1. Placing the first mass production order of the Eco One bag - reaching factory MOQ's</p>
<p>2. Assist with Transport costs associated with delivering stock into our UK Warehouse space ready to send on to all of you.</p>
<p>Your contribution will ultimately help us in reaching our goal of launching our sustainable brand, and we hope this can be the first of many more sustainable items in the very near future!</p>
<p>Reaching our campaign goal would also mean we can make use of and prevent 12 recycled plastic bottles per backpack from reaching our landfills, rivers and oceans, improving the environment for future our generations. The more pledges, the more bottles we re-use.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>TESTING &amp; MANUFACTURING FACILITY</strong></p>
<p>The bags have been put through it's paces with rigorous product testing both at the factory, here in the UK by ourselves, and on various testing trips which included land, sea &amp; air. The Eco One bags are now ready for production!</p>
<p>We have been working with the factory producing the bags for a number of years as we both share the same vision &amp; desire to produce quality products which are at the cutting edge of design yet now using sustainable materials.</p>
<p>The Factory are continually pushing the boundaries by looking for new and improved production methods and materials that will allow for even more new and interesting products to be produced from re-used materials whether plastics, leather or similar. While doing so they always ensure the correct global social and ethical standards are met both for the both factory itself and also the materials they use. Active Sedex and also Global Recycling Standard cerfitications are held by the factory.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>DELIVERY</strong></p>
<p>As a team we have strong product and project management experience of launching new products to market and fully understand the processes involved in manufacturing, transporting and delivering products on time. Rest assured we have everything planned to the finest detail to deliver the Eco One Backpack when we say we will.</p>
<p>Due to the current worldwide issues with COVID-19 we have factored in additional time to allow the products to be produced, shipped and arrive at the end destination in the quality we promise.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>CURRENT LIMITATIONS</strong></p>
<p>We had big visions when embarking on this campaign. Video's &amp; Imagery showcasing the bags within hustle and bustle of city life, on scenic walks &amp; mountain hikes, however reality is somewhat different due to the COVID 19 restrictions.</p>
<p>Our NEW daily commutes from the bedroom to the office (which is also the kitchen), and our long walks and mountain hikes now limited to the end of the garden are far from scenic!</p>
<p>With this in mind, you may need to use your imagination at times! We do have some early shots from a local beach and surround area in the UK which should help!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We’re focused on producing products that not only are made from recycled materials but also where our economic footprint is as minimal as possible. Packaging, shipping and the surrounding aspects are all as environmentally friendly and low impact as possible.</p>
<p>The products are high quality meaning they will last for many years to come, yet even at the end of its life, the product is fully recyclable and something longer term would are looking to implement a solution for via Trade in options.</p>
<p>Due to the current World crisis of COVID-19 we have safeguarded against potential delays posed by the virus outbreak and included sizeable buffers through our planning and delivery, however this does not mean this will not change depending on governmental restrictions. We have included an additional month onto our standard buffer for delivery where this margin for delay covers any issues at the factory, plus also delays with official paperwork through customs due to limited staff and also couriers delivering to our backers.</p>
<p><br/>Three Peaks and our partners along the supply chain will only carry out the required work if the working environment is safe to do so and government measured are met.<br/>If any delays occur due to the current situation and pass the exaggerated buffer we have implemented, all backers will be notified at the earliest opportunity with full details of why from the outset.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITMENTS</strong></p>
<p>The Eco one bag is made from the highest quality RPET material that has been full tried and tested and approved by the Global Recycling Standard ensuring the product is not only Sustainable but strong and durable. The product has been internally tested at the factory for its strength and durability and is also something we at Three peaks have used ourselves and really put through it's paces, but just to help, within each product, we will be offering a Care Leaflet that will advise customers on how to look after their bag to maximise the life of the product such as wash instructions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>PACKAGING</strong></p>
<p>The packaging is simple and in the form of a mail order paper bag. It is strong enough to protect the products during shipment where it needs to go, yet fully recyclable at end of use. Items will be individually packaged in this format from the factory meaning it will reduce the need for any additional packaging to be added before when sending to you!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1588590939/ntokzb0ltbmxfhw63efr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>REUSABILITY &amp; RECYCLABILITY</strong></p>
<p>As the products are made from recycled PET bottles, the bags are fully recyclable at the end of their life however,  we do also hope in the future if the project is funded, to set up a trade in policy which would allow backers to return their backpacks that we could re-cycle into new backpacks, and in return offering a discount on a brand new item.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>SUSTAINABILITY</strong></p>
<p>The Bag itself is made from 100% recycled PET bottles, everything from the outer shell to its inner compartments, straps and Zip covers are all produced using Recycled PET material. Every bag uses 12 recycled plastic bottles to create the bag which saves those bottles from littering our oceans, rivers and beaches.<br/>As for the packaging used, whether the inner cards and leaflets, as well as the outer brown mail order bag that will be used to ship to our backers will all be made from recycled brown card that can be fully recycled at the end of its life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY FACTORIES</strong></p>
<p>The Factory that we have partnered with and will be producing our products hold current and up to date Certification and Audits from both the Global Recycling Standard and Sedex external audits meaning that the factory not only operate in an Socially and Ethically correct manner, but also are using fully approved recycled materials within their manufacturing process.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>SHIPMENT &amp; DELIVERY</strong></p>
<p>Our plan is to ship orders to campaign backers in Sep 2020. By working with a manufacturer we fully trust and a secure and experienced UK based shipping company we are confident we can achieve this goal.</p>
<p>Delivering quality and fantastic customer service is very important to us, and we have vast experience in our team in order to ensure this is maintained.</p>
<p>We have safeguarded against potential delays posed by the virus outbreak, however please note we and our partners along the chain will only do so if the working environment is safe and government measured are met.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>SUSTAINABLE FULFILMENT &amp; DISTRIBUTION</strong></p>
<p>To help reduce the need for re-packing any items ready to send to customers we have decided that every backpack will be packaged at source in it's Brown Recycled Mail order bags that removes the requirement for any additional boxes and waste.<br/>In addition the fulfillment and distribution partner we are looking to use if successful are continually looking to reduce their carbon footprint by investing in low consumption lighting and heating for all warehousing, as well as teaming up with low emission couriers who when combined form the largest all electric delivery fleet in the UK.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>OTHER PRACTICES WE ARE IMPLEMENTING</strong></p>
<p>If successful and Three Peaks is able to launch its Eco One Bag, for all Mainstream sales following this Kickstarter campaign, we will be donating 5% of the sales revenue per bag to an Ocean plastics charity who are also tirelessly working to reduce the impact that single use plastics is having on our planet. We hope the donations made from the purchases of our bags will support their great cause and make a real difference for future generations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>In a nutshell... what we have is a Recycled, Anti Bacterial Backpack, which boasts high end quality, is packed with practical features and yet competitively priced for all. A sustainable bag for the future, a bag which gives back to the environment, and ultimately something we can all be proud of.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey guys. Thank you for showing interest in my campaign. Extreme sports if you will have always been an interest of mine. I grew up wearing billabong and idolizing Tony Hawk. Well now I would like to take the leap of faith and start my own skating brand , Killuminati Grim Seeker. Fortunately I have been able to begin this journey but to take it to the level I want it to be at and what it deserves to be at is going to need a little help from you. This is something i am very passionate about and something I have been working very very hard on acheiving. The thought of using a crowdfunding site never crossed my mind as i've just been driving more for doordash and using other outlets to obtain funding for my cloth9ing brand. The risk factor is obviously high as there are tons of clothing brands out there but what makes me different is my initiative and don't give up attitude no matter what.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The funding I will so graciously acquire off of this site is going to working capital and advertisement. I have already begun the process of trademarking certain logos to protect my work and myself. I have put alot of thought, time and effort into this project and just need a little help from you to make the impact i know this brand can and will make. I plan on investing in a store front and possibly adding in a skate ramp to incorporate the sport that this brand is being funded around. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>To be completely honest this is going to be a leap of faith for anyone including myself. The fact that i have invested every bit of the rest of my life savings into this should show you how serious and goal oriented i am at making this dream a reality. The risk is always there for any project you do in life but if you don't try how do you know you wont succeed? I am putting everything  i have into this including my faith and now i ask that you return the favor and put some faith into me. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenge</h3>
<p>There are always risks when starting something new. The question is do you have what it takes to look past those risks and do whatever it takes to succeed? Well I'm telling you I do have what it takes. I've done some financial planning and profit margin for this is unreal. I am excellent at budgeting and putting my dollar to good use. I do take risks but i always make sure to chart it out and plan for every scenario whether good or bad. The only challenge i have met so far is the amount of fund I had to start versus life. </p>

We check the time constantly – but what we are looking for? Instead of watching the numbers that signify the moments as they pass us by, we should be watching the moments themselves and enjoying them for all that they are worth. Sadly, most people get caught up in a cycle of urgency and catch-up, thinking that they never have the time that they need to do everything that they want to do.</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>In Ancient Greek, there were two words to express the concept of time: Chronos and Kairos. Chronos is quantitative, and Kairos is qualitative. There is the time that ticks by on the clock and the time that you fill up with life – if you're fortunate enough to do so. We get the word ""chronological"" from the Ancient Greek Chronos, but Kairos, on the other hand, is something that may seem a little more obscure to some people. However, the concept may be obscure but not the feeling itself. After all, each of us knows what it means to fill up our time with fun, vibrancy and goodness.</strong></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566581539/hayzpebvm7iebpjbqn7p.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566581571/kdtax4oeuz2x4ccvw4fc.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>Inspired by time in the Kairos meaning, KAIROS is a watch that measures not only the seconds, minutes, and hours in a day but the emotions that you feel in each moment: your passion, anger, fear, happiness, calm, and love. Made from lava stone, KAIROS gives you a sense of how well you are living your life and not just how much time you have to do this and how much time has passed since that. There are two versions of KAIROS, one that reveals your mood and the actual time and one that tells you just your mood.

  Putting Life into Your Time The more fast-paced our world becomes, the more we lose sight of what matters in each day – the quality of our time, the joy in our lives, the magic of every moment. We check the time constantly – but what we are looking for? Instead of watching the numbers that signify the moments as they pass us by, we should be watching the moments themselves and enjoying them for all that they are worth. Sadly, most people get caught up in a cycle of urgency and catch-up, thinking that they never have the time that they need to do everything that they want to do. In Ancient Greek, there were two words to express the concept of time: Chronos and Kairos. Chronos is quantitative, and Kairos is qualitative. There is the time that ticks by on the clock and the time that you fill up with life – if you're fortunate enough to do so. We get the word ""chronological"" from the Ancient Greek Chronos, but Kairos, on the other hand, is something that may seem a little more obscure to some people. However, the concept may be obscure but not the feeling itself. After all, each of us knows what it means to fill up our time with fun, vibrancy and goodness.   Inspired by time in the Kairos meaning, KAIROS is a watch that measures not only the seconds, minutes, and hours in a day but the emotions that you feel in each moment: your passion, anger, fear, happiness, calm, and love. Made from lava stone, KAIROS gives you a sense of how well you are living your life and not just how much time you have to do this and how much time has passed since that. There are two versions of KAIROS, one that reveals your mood and the actual time and one that tells you just your mood. This happens as the lava changes color following your mood. This is an anti-time watch, the first of its kind. The display features natural lava volcanic stone and the mood stone underneath records your body temperature in order to show your mood with lava details. It is changing to red, green, indigo, black, and blue and other colors, correlating to your unique ""inner"" state.  While other watches run on Chronos, our watch shows your Kairos moments, the ""inner"" unique time that you are feeling. This way, you get to realize the quality of your time, discerning all your most magical moments as they happen and seeing all your emotions as they arise. KAIROS features a real blade, which symbolizes the process of cutting time, and because of this combined with the natural volcanic lava ( a stone of rebirth from the Earth's core), you can count on it for an intense but calming energy, perfect for soothing anxiety, anger, and other negative emotions. KAIROS watch features: There are two versions of KAIROS, one that tells you your mood and the time and one that tells you just your mood. Size - 44MM X 12MMMovement -  JAPAN MIYOTA QuartzThe mood lava details , that change color based on your mood - records your body temperature via liquid crystal and quartz stones placed on the back side of the watch , similar to the mood ringCase - Stainless steel , Matte blackStraps - 3 options : Black Crocodile Italian Leather , Black Carbon Leather , Black Sport RubberGlass - Scratch proof , Sapphire coatedDisplay - Natural lava volcanic stoneHeadquarters in Rome, Italy and Zug , Switzerland

I'm Kimberly Holt. I am the inventor of the Light Up My Life Maternity Band. I want to share with you why I am so passionate about this project. <br/> </h3><p><i>This project has been about 7 years in the making!</i><br/>I am a mother to a beautiful 6 year old, and yes, I am almost 50! </p><p>After having 3 grown children and being pregnant with my 4th, I realized how awesome it would have been to be able to share the movement of my babies with my husband and my kids. I have a three grown children and two are new parents of babies of their own. I am a very proud grandmother of two beautiful baby girls. I would give anything to have had the Light Up My Life Maternity Band while my girls were pregnant. So I don't want to waste any more time. I'll be ready for the next one!</p><p>It's important to be consistent when you're counting kicks and if you don't have the ability to focus it could mean trouble. With a rule of thumb being that you should count at least 10 movements in an hour, mom doesn't have to try to remember, or heaven forbid guess. The LUML Maternity Band counts baby's kicks accurately so she doesn't have to. Women are busy! They are busy working and running errands, keeping house and taking care of their families. It has nothing to do with being lazy. It can be hard to not get distracted when you're trying to count manually. The band can be worn optionally under your clothing for discretion and a wristband will communicate with it or send notifications to your smartphone when activated. This brings great peace of mind when you haven't noticed a lot of activity and really need to be monitoring.</p><p>I think the really great thing about it is that it's not an intimidating device. It doesn't play on the fears and paranoia of the mother to count baby's kicks. It is a fun instrument that just happens to have the benefit of reassuring mom that baby is doing just fine!</p><p>I am genuinely looking forward to getting the band into production. I hope you will join us and be a part of something really great!</p><p><strong>Although we have a working prototype and it is patent pending, I still feel this is in conception mode.  I originally did not intended it as a medical device; however, I really feel that it should be, and this is why:</strong></p><div>
<p><i>Counting kicks is a great way to meditate and bond with your baby. But feeling those kicks and movements are far from just fun thrills—they're also a super important way for mom to monitor (and protect) her developing baby.</i> When I created the LUML maternity band it was with the intention of adding a little excitement to the pregnancy. However, when I discussed it with other expectant mothers I discovered that my work was actually more valuable than I had previously thought! While the band generated a lot of excitement as an entertainment device, <i><strong>the real value was in its ability to detect the movement of the baby to ensure it's health.</strong></i></p>
<p>Mothers in their last trimester are expected to count kicks as a way to ensure baby's health. And as it turns out, it's not as easy as it sounds. It's easy to forget or lose track of kicks. While there is currently nothing like the LUML Maternity Band, there are devices that let you count kicks manually. You feel a movement, you push the button, and voila you keep track... but it's not a very reliable method and as we soon found out, moms don’t really like it! It's actually inconvenient and a bit of a nuisance.  So we added an LED display counter! We all know monitoring your baby's activity, especially in the last trimester is very important and currently the most reliable method, is of course, manually counting kicks, but check this out...</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>The Light Up My Life Maternity Band Can Count Kicks for You!</i></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>It goes even further to include fun lights and sounds, including soft musical tones and even personal recordings like baby laughter or family voices that can help to provide reassurance of baby's health when it can be difficult to focus.  </p>
<p><strong>Wireless capability!</strong> A wireless component will send kick alerts to your smartphone and to a wristband worn by mom or other family members.</p>
<p><br/> </p>
<h3><strong>HOW IT WORKS</strong></h3>
<p><strong>THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE LED LIGHTS AND THE VOLUME OF THE SOUND ARE DETERMINED BY THE INTENSITY OF BABY'S KICKS.</strong></p>

<p><i>The Light Up My Life Maternity Band is completely safe for baby and for mom. It uses only sensors that measure topical movement of the abdomen and does not utilize any type of ultrasound. It features a thick black-out panel as not to disturb baby.</i></p>
<p>The band is easy to recharge using a standard USB charger. Made of lightweight and breathable jersey fabric, it's designed to slip comfortably over your favorite maternity band or under or over your clothes!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You can easily turn off the lights or turn off the sound or both. The counter will only turn off when the band is off and can be reset at any time by just turning off the band and turning it back on. </p>

</div></div>","Hi! I'm Kimberly Holt. I am the inventor of the Light Up My Life Maternity Band. I want to share with you why I am so passionate about this project.  This project has been about 7 years in the making!I am a mother to a beautiful 6 year old, and yes, I am almost 50! After having 3 grown children and being pregnant with my 4th, I realized how awesome it would have been to be able to share the movement of my babies with my husband and my kids. I have a three grown children and two are new parents of babies of their own. I am a very proud grandmother of two beautiful baby girls. I would give anything to have had the Light Up My Life Maternity Band while my girls were pregnant. So I don't want to waste any more time. I'll be ready for the next one!It's important to be consistent when you're counting kicks and if you don't have the ability to focus it could mean trouble. With a rule of thumb being that you should count at least 10 movements in an hour, mom doesn't have to try to remember, or heaven forbid guess. The LUML Maternity Band counts baby's kicks accurately so she doesn't have to. Women are busy! They are busy working and running errands, keeping house and taking care of their families. It has nothing to do with being lazy. It can be hard to not get distracted when you're trying to count manually. The band can be worn optionally under your clothing for discretion and a wristband will communicate with it or send notifications to your smartphone when activated. This brings great peace of mind when you haven't noticed a lot of activity and really need to be monitoring.I think the really great thing about it is that it's not an intimidating device. It doesn't play on the fears and paranoia of the mother to count baby's kicks. It is a fun instrument that just happens to have the benefit of reassuring mom that baby is doing just fine!I am genuinely looking forward to getting the band into production. I hope you will join us and be a part of something really great!Although we have a working prototype and it is patent pending, I still feel this is in conception mode.  I originally did not intended it as a medical device; however, I really feel that it should be, and this is why:
Counting kicks is a great way to meditate and bond with your baby. But feeling those kicks and movements are far from just fun thrills—they're also a super important way for mom to monitor (and protect) her developing baby. When I created the LUML maternity band it was with the intention of adding a little excitement to the pregnancy. However, when I discussed it with other expectant mothers I discovered that my work was actually more valuable than I had previously thought! While the band generated a lot of excitement as an entertainment device, the real value was in its ability to detect the movement of the baby to ensure it's health.
Mothers in their last trimester are expected to count kicks as a way to ensure baby's health. And as it turns out, it's not as easy as it sounds. It's easy to forget or lose track of kicks. While there is currently nothing like the LUML Maternity Band, there are devices that let you count kicks manually. You feel a movement, you push the button, and voila you keep track... but it's not a very reliable method and as we soon found out, moms don’t really like it! It's actually inconvenient and a bit of a nuisance.  So we added an LED display counter! We all know monitoring your baby's activity, especially in the last trimester is very important and currently the most reliable method, is of course, manually counting kicks, but check this out...
 
The Light Up My Life Maternity Band Can Count Kicks for You!
 
It goes even further to include fun lights and sounds, including soft musical tones and even personal recordings like baby laughter or family voices that can help to provide reassurance of baby's health when it can be difficult to focus.  
Wireless capability! A wireless component will send kick alerts to your smartphone and to a wristband worn by mom or other family members.
 
HOW IT WORKS
THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE LED LIGHTS AND THE VOLUME OF THE SOUND ARE DETERMINED BY THE INTENSITY OF BABY'S KICKS.

 
The Light Up My Life Maternity Band is completely safe for baby and for mom. It uses only sensors that measure topical movement of the abdomen and does not utilize any type of ultrasound. It features a thick black-out panel as not to disturb baby.
The band is easy to recharge using a standard USB charger. Made of lightweight and breathable jersey fabric, it's designed to slip comfortably over your favorite maternity band or under or over your clothes!
 
You can easily turn off the lights or turn off the sound or both. The counter will only turn off when the band is off and can be reset at any time by just turning off the band and turning it back on. 

 
Sure baby can light up mom's face, but what if baby could light up an entire room?  A removable SD card allows you to record your own sounds. You can record anything!The Light Up My Life Maternity Band comes with a set of default tones, but you can add your own family voices, baby laughter.. anything you want! Record your experiences to share with your child later!
Peace of mind is everything, especially when it comes to your child. The Light Up My Life Maternity Band is designed to reassure mom AND dad of baby's well-being. So often fathers seem to feel a little left out until baby arrives and then it suddenly the whole thing can be a bit overwhelming. Watching over baby while mom is resting helps to create a sense of closeness with the child before he or she is born. Dad can look forward to the birth with a little more confidence in his abilities!
 




 
What we will do with funds. 
We want to accomplish these things before production:

Wireless accessories to send notifications to your smartphone and LCD counter displays for wristbands for mom and family members.
Better fitting capabilities. We want to achieve a one-size-fits all to eliminate exchanges based on incorrect sizing. We will hire a great designer to make sure it's not only aesthetically pleasing, but because this is a maternity belly band it needs to be more ergonomic to help support the abdomen and relieve fatigue on the back.
We are considering a few other sensors to address a sensitivity issue leading to a more reliable method to monitor kicks as the band can occasionally mistake mother's movements for baby. We have built the band using Arduino programming; however, the parts are expensive and this can certainly be accomplished in other languages using less pricey parts and by a professional programmer. We want everyone to be able to afford a band.
We want to experiment with other speakers and soundboards for optimum sound quality and reduction in battery use.
We want to redesign the mainboard panel to not be so bulky.
We want to meet with with trusted and recognized doctors in the field to make sure we have every possible safety issue covered. Although no ultrasound is used and the panel prevents baby from being disturbed, official recognition from prominent professionals is a priority. This requires backing to do a bit of traveling.
We have a great little team here but we need more help getting the word out. We need funds for social media advertising.

If we do not meet our funding goals we will do as much as we can and continue going forward.
 

 
 

 
 





This is a wonderful tool for new parents.
One of our visions we hope to achieve is to make it available in OBGYN and midwife facilities as a rental.  This would eliminate it ending up in a box or in a landfill later down the road.

<p>In order to give you the best wireless sound experience possible we used the <b>bluetooth CSR8675 chip</b> that offers a <b>walking range up to 20 meters</b> (open air) and the <b>shareMe technology</b> enables headphone to headphone sharing via bluetooth. Currently there is nothing better in the market to guarantee that wireless sound experience is nothing short of amazing.</p>

We know that sound quality is the most important feature in a headphone. That’s why we spent a long time to get a crisp and full sound that makes listening to your favorite music a delight. No matter at home on the couch, traveling around the world or sharing with your friends. In order to make the Lynxsonic 4:33 truly special, we use the newest Bluetooth 5.0 technology. We wanted to make sure that you are ahead of everyone else.

The best sound is what you most enjoy listening to. The Lynxsonic 4:33 will deliver on your expectations for super crisp sound with powerful beats. Wireless listening has highest sound quality ensured by both our nearly perfect acoustic structure design and Qualcomm® aptX™, aptX™ Low Latency, aptX™ HD. 
Qualcomm® aptX™ HD audio ensures Lynxsonic 4:33 can deliver High Definition (HD) audio. It preserves sound data through the audio transmission, resulting in a ‘better-than-CD’ listening experience.

Especially our active noise cancelling technology will block any outside noises that would distract from enjoying every song or insatiable movie experience. The total harmonic distortion is less than 1% @1KHz 1mW and the frequency response is between 20Hz to 20KHz. We make sure that the latest audio technology goes inside the Lynxsonic 4:33.

In order to give you the best wireless sound experience possible we used the bluetooth CSR8675 chip that offers a walking range up to 20 meters (open air) and the shareMe technology enables headphone to headphone sharing via bluetooth. Currently there is nothing better in the market to guarantee that wireless sound experience is nothing short of amazing.
Powered by Qualcomm® aptX™ HD.

Plenty of headphone brand claims to have active noise cancelling technology, but only a few can truly live up to that promise. Bose, Sennheiser and Beats have solid systems.

Our goal was to exceed and benchmark our technology with the best. The result is remarkable. We deployed 5 microphones not only on the outside of the headphones, but also inside to enhance ANC capabilities.

In the end we are able to reach an ANC value of 36db, unparalleled. We call this the joy of silence.

Buttons can be really cool and useful, but we don't like them all over the product. We wanted to keep everything as smooth and intuitive as possible. That is why the Lynxsonic headphones only have two buttons: 1. an anc&bluetooth/pairing button and 2. a talk-free button.

All other functions can be controlled by touch: swiping and tapping. you don’t need to fumble for tiny buttons hidden somewhere in the back, all you need to do are bold strokes or simple taps to manoeuvre and control volume, skipping songs, pause and accepting calls.
Simplicity at its best and this is how it works:


Enjoying wireless sound heavily hinges on battery life. Nothing worse than traveling and the headphones die shortly after. For all of you that demand unparalleled battery life we packaged a 1000 mah battery in the Lynxsonic for more than 40 hours of non-stop bluetooth usage! 

Of course we balanced the weight to not compromise on comfort. You can go through weeks of listening to your favourite music or podcasts and don’t need to think about charging.

Just grab and go, ready when you are! Especially for all you travelers and commuters, we developed the Lynxsonic with you in mind.


We know how important sharing is. That is why we offer two ways to share music when you are on the bus, on the plane or simply at home watching a movie with others. If you have two bluetooth headphones, both can easily connect and share the same song or watch the same movie.

If the other person does not have a bluetooth headphone, you can simply plug the other headphone or earplugs into your Lynxsonic to enjoy together.

Actually, two Lynxsonic headphones and two non-bluetooth headphones/plugs can be sharing the same audio/video file: basically a family affair.

That is sharing simplified and purposefully built-in, because we know that sharing your favourite new album or watching a film together is twice as good as alone!

We believe in a world of wireless electronic products. That's why we developed the 4:33 with wireless charging. Easy as pie, just drop it on the wireless charging matt and in no time you have 40 hours of music at hand.

Especially when travelling there is always the question before going to sleep: what device shall I charge over night? Now you don't need to compromise: Smart phone, smart watch, headphones, all fit on the charging matt (which we offer to you as well) and when you wake up, everything is charged and ready to go.

Design plays a big role and we deeply care about unique, purposeful design. Everything starts with strokes of genius that evolves and morphes into a beautiful product.

We truly believe that a product should combine iconic design that is original and stands out from the rest. That's why the Lynxsonic 4:33 are not oval shaped, but angular, matching the facial structure along the jaw bone.

In the end everything we look at, touch and interact with should have a design that is purposeful, deliberate and makes sense to us and most importantly to you.

We are very fortunate to work with one of the most distinguished designers of our time who brings over 25 years of experience from the car and electronics industry to the table: Simon Loasby.

With Simon on board the journey of Lynxsonic is also a journey through design and a lesson in how to create something that is packed with technology, a display of comfort with eye-catching, differentiating, provoking and desirable design features.

Let's hear what Simon has to say about the design, the features and why he designed the Lynxsonic 4:33 this way:

Headphones need to be durable and lightweight, stylish and practical and small enough to accompany any journey.

We are using materials that matter and that make sense. Super sturdy headband aluminium core with a durable and flexible plastic cover to give it stability, flexibility and style.

Ear pieces can swivel and extend to provide the perfect fit and comfort. Metal hinges to make sure nothing breaks, no matter how many times you fold and pack. The super soft leather ear cushions are made for comfort and also flexible in order to match your head shape.


All of our headbands need to withstand 30,000 bends. Only then we know that it is excellent and good enough for you.

We have done this for our prototypes and after rounds of re-engineering we found the perfect combination of sturdiness, flexibility, style and comfort that also passed the bending test.

While the headbands have a smooth and sturdy top part paired with a strong aluminum core, the inside comprises of soft materials.

The magic of sound and silence is deeply embedded in the ear pieces. It needs to be small and yet powerful, it needs to hold pc boards, chips, batteries, ANC modules, sound boards and ports for plugs, buttons and microphones while staying cool and comfortable.

We managed to develop sound technology that is all of that above and still fits snuggly into our custom shaped ear pieces.

Our team of structural designers and sound engineers did a remarkable job to make this happen. The cushions are leather wrapped memory foam pieces that offer remarkable comfort for wearing them every day and especially on long journeys.

Traveling with your Lynxsonics requires a casing that protects them from scratches, damages, dirt, theft and other harms. Since we have been developing and producing sturdy headphone casings for over a decade, you can be assured that you will get a high quality product.

Every casing comes with an airplane adaptor, 1/4-inch stereo-plug adaptor, detachable audio cable, USB-C charging cable, proper cable storage and a soft cloth protection bag.

If you decide to get the deluxe wireless charging version, there will be a Qi charging pad in the travel case as well.


We put together a very interesting basket of different product categories, a base version and a deluxe version, an offer to purchase pairs and a family pack that has the lowest price possible.

We understand that there are different tastes for colors. To keep it simple and to reduce costs (which results in a lower purchase price for you), we limited the color choice to: white/grey and black/copper.

We are humble, but confident that our headphones will find many friends through this campaign.
 Get Cash Back on the Projects You Love! 

We look at Lynxsonic as more than a project or a product. For us this is the beginning of something exciting and adventurous. In order to get to the point where we felt comfortable to release our first products, we worked very hard and constantly questioned what we achieved in order to get further.

We tested and tested and tested and improved further. That is why we call it a studio. It is a place where we engineer technology that offers sound and silence, that brings together the desire to craft headphones, delivering emotions to our customers and joy to their ears.

Our studio is equipped with machinery to test every product meticulously until we are convinced that it is ready. But in the end, we want your opinion to continuously improve.

At Lynxsonic we have one mission: delivering headphones that live up to its promise: perfection in sound and silence.

We don't want to over-promise crazy AI technologies, touch-screens glued to the earpieces or mind-reading sensors that would cause a massive delay until the product is ready.

We had a very clear mission from the beginning: amazing headphones with the world's best active noise cancelling technology that provides the ultimate sound experience and give you more than 40 hours of wireless listening.

In order to ensure delivering 100% on our promise, we started Lynxsonic with a true veteran in the audio tech business and a good friend of ours for many years: Charles Lau. Charles has been developing and manufacturing audio technology for more than 15 years.

His production expertise, deep engineering knowledge and very high quality standards are the perfect foundation for Lynxsonic. Over the past 2 years we worked together to design, prototype and fully develop the Lynxsonic 4:33.

We are very happy with the final product that is designed with traveller and commuters in mind offering unparalleled battery life of 40+ hours wireless listening with Active Noise Cancelling on. Easy to wear, long lasting, flexible, foldable to a small package - we understand what is needed to make your journey as pleasant as possible.

Over the course of the past year we have tested our prototypes on short and long haul traveling in order to ensure that the 4:33 are a true companion on every journey.

All together, we have put a basket of incredible little functions and features into our headphones in order to make your listening experience seamless, joyful and easy to use. You never want to go without Lynxsonics, ever again.

We set out to create the best pair of headphones in the market for the best possible price. We call this promise accessible premium.

The Lynxsonic team consists of a unique collaboration of experienced professionals and sound lovers that came together to develop the best pair of headphones in the market. Together we have vast experience in different areas for making exceptional audio technology.

Simon is one of the world's leading car designers with a track record in designing iconic automobiles as well as really cool projects like the People's Car Project.
Florian has been working in Strategy, Marketing and starting tech companies in different markets for the past 15 years.
Charles knows everything about audio technology: he has engineered, manufactured and sold his own audio technology products for over 15 years. He is a veteran in the audio tech industry and has his own manufacturing, testing and production facility.
Birger has been working on creative projects around the globe. He understands how everything needs to come together in order to turn a creative thought into an emotional product.
Sara worked for a variety of tech companies building supply chain managements, partner networks and sales structures. She understands the ins and outs of finding the right partnerships to bring projects alive and promised kept.

To develop the Lynxsonic 4:33 we took extra time to get everything right. Technology can be fragile and needs careful planning. Even more so when applied in a wearable product. From initial idea to final prototype we spend more than 2 years.


Sound and silence in perfection was our goal. Our inspiration for this combination came from the three-movement composition by composer John Cage.

His bold work gave us the courage to create a bold and exceptional pair of headphones. Naming our first Lynxsonic product 4:33 is an homage and standing ovation to his remarkable work.
Enjoy sound and silence from the one and only John Cage:

<h3>Why are we back fundraising at Indiegogo?</h3>
<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has put a huge dent into our business. Travel for most had been halted, hurting our cash flow, and had kept most of our company’s resources in inventory that we stocked up on back in 2019. Because of this, we simply don’t have the money needed to do these new bags justice, so we are asking for your help to make them a reality.</p>
<p>We are thankful for all the doctors, nurses, scientists, and many others who have helped the world fight against this pandemic, and that vaccines are now being distributed around the world. We are excited to see our travel fam back on the road, and travel with confidence once again.</p>

Our campaign  has now ended but you can still pre-order while we're in production! 

 

Since launching Arden Cove in 2016, we’ve specialized in designing practical travel bags that are theft resistant, water resistant, and beautiful. Move throughout your day with confidence, knowing that your bags are made to keep up with you. 
We launched our first flagship Full Crossbody bag on IGG back in 2016, and after delivering thousands of bags that have traveled all around the world (take a look at our 300+ 5 star reviews), we are thrilled to be back with a new line of bags to help people travel in even more ways.




 



Bags are ready to start production!

We’re here to answer any questions:

Each of our four designs are made to perfectly adapt to a multitude of situations. Pick the bag you love, or complete your collection with our exclusive to Indiegogo bundles. Upgrade your adventure to first class with Arden Cove.
 


*  With backer feedback, we will make the following changes to the bags:

Purple lining which will match our Full Crossbody Black/Gold Bags. 
New color! Black with Gunmetal Hardware and Steel Blue Lining (photos below)
The three net pockets will have zipper closure
Pen slot added next to wall pockets

 




 
When it comes to dream travel backpacks, the MB Backpack checks all our wish list items. Large enough to carry a laptop in its own dedicated padded compartment, it also zips completely open like a suitcase so you can pack to your heart’s content. 

It replaces or complements suitcases, the padded backpack straps make it comfier to carry than a duffle bag, and it’s stylish enough to go straight from the plane to your business meeting. 
Take it on your business trip, or as your carry on for a longer trip. There’s room for all your necessities plus a little extra- perhaps a few day’s worth of clothes for the next time your luggage gets “misplaced” again?

Elise Crossbody vs Full Crossbody
Read our blog post for an in depth comparison of the Elise Crossbody and our original flagship bag the Full Crossbody. 


 



Slash Resistant Lining
Unlike other bags claiming to be slash resistant, our bags are fully lined with slash-resistant material. Yes, that means 360° and all those nooks and crannies.

Clasp Zipper Pulls
Zippers are protected from incognito tugs with clasps which secure each compartment closed. It only takes a glance to tell sneaky hands to “keep walking, buddy!”  
Locking Straps
We specially designed these twist locks to sit beautifully on the end of straps so that you can keep them securely on the bag, or unscrew, loop, and lock around a pole or chair at a restaurant. 

Reinforced Straps
Our microfiber leather straps are reinforced with steel cable making them extra tough and difficult to cut through. 
RFID Blocking Wallet & Pockets
It’s 2021, protect your digital information! RFID-blocking materials in our built in wallets and wall pockets will keep your credit cards and passports safe.   Water Resistant Nylon
A little grey cloud can sneak up on you when you’re having fun. No worries- all those beads of rain or snow will just slide right off our buttery smooth water resistant nylon. YKK Waterproof Zippers
Only the best for you-  YKK zippers are first in class and their waterproof ones on our bags keep rain (or spilled drinks!) out of your bag.  Add a lock on zipper loops
Want even more security? No problem! Our zippers come with a locking loop for you to add your own wire locks and have even more protection.

Cushy Backpack Straps
Our MB Packing Backpack and Dolores Commuter Backpack both come with a mesh padded back and straps for a super comfy yet breathable carry. 

Purse Feet
There are four metal feet on the bottom of the Elise Crossbody to protect from scratches when setting your bag down.
 

Why are we back fundraising at Indiegogo?
The Covid-19 pandemic has put a huge dent into our business. Travel for most had been halted, hurting our cash flow, and had kept most of our company’s resources in inventory that we stocked up on back in 2019. Because of this, we simply don’t have the money needed to do these new bags justice, so we are asking for your help to make them a reality.
We are thankful for all the doctors, nurses, scientists, and many others who have helped the world fight against this pandemic, and that vaccines are now being distributed around the world. We are excited to see our travel fam back on the road, and travel with confidence once again.
 




Let us know what colors we should unlock with stretch goals in the comment section! 
 


We are two sisters, native San Franciscans, who started Arden Cove in 2016 with the dream of making better travel bags. We dreamed up our Anti-theft Waterproof Crossbody which we crowdfunded on Indiegogo in 2017, and have been selling bags on our website ArdenCove.com ever since. 
Our bags have won Smarter Travels’s Best Travel Products Awards and have been featured in Travel + Leisure, CNN Money, USA Today, Huffington Post, and more.
We have sold thousands of bags, and over 300+ 5 star reviews from happy customers all over the world, and are incredibly grateful for the opportunity to make our dream bags thanks to backers like you. Thank you!
 

We've been in business for a while now, so we have experience dealing with the unforeseen issues that come up with the production process. We've accounted for any possible mishaps in our production time line, and will keep you informed every step of the way in case anything comes up. We've already discussed these timelines with our manufacturer, and are confident that we can deliver in a timely manner, while ensuring the quality and standards we hold ourselves too. 
 


Spreading the word about this makes a huge difference to our small business.

  On the outside, Circular is sleek, seamless, and discreet. On the inside, it’s powered by advanced mechanical customization and intuitive AI. When it comes to user experience, we’ve made no compromises. The result? A seamless experience that works for you day & night.  Can we introduce you to someone very special? Meet Kira. She’s an integral part of the Circular experience, and her whole goal is to make your life easier—from helping you make improvements to let you know when it’s time to step it up.  Circular never sleeps, but you’ll sleep better.That’s because what Circular does best is synthesize and analyze your body signals (night and day!) for unique recommendations and advanced wellness correlations to improve your well-being. Circular Tracks:   While designing Circular, our wish was to create a device that would assist us in responding to our body signals in a healthier way—helping us make optimal daily activity choices instead of just measuring the metrics. With Circular, you can learn about the effect of your sleep on your daily performance and the effect of your activities on the quality of your sleep and your future wellness.   Everyone is unique, whether it is in terms of lifestyle, fitness, thoughts, choices, recovery, health, or sleep patterns. Circular's tracking features hold their true benefits in our cross-analysis. Day & Night tracking combined enables us to deeply understand how the body reacts to events and what it needs.We’ve spent a whole year working with sleep and activity specialists, doctors, and Ph.D. students to develop algorithms that effectively analyze your body signals in line with laboratory equipment.The precision can only get better with time, making Circular one of the most accurate and noninvasive tracking devices on the market.  Get real-time, personalized recommendations. Control your ring, visualize your progress, meet (and compete with!) your wellness community, and get impactful recommendations through the Circular app.  We’re taking wearable tech to the next level by establishing baselines for users instead of just measuring metrics and spitting out raw data. Through the Circular app, you’ll be able to:
Control your ring.
Measure and visualize your progress through our sleep and activity scoring system.
Meet (and compete with!) your fitness community.
  When working out, we don’t want to wear a device made of precious gems; neither do we want to wear a plastic-looking device to an elegant event.We believe that wearables should seamlessly blend into our everyday lives, and that’s exactly what Circular does.It’s scratch-resistant, water-resistant, and you can switch up your style to fit the occasion with interchangeable outer shells.      Need a charge? Connect on-the-go with our mobile charging solution. 
The Circular ring connects via Bluetooth to your iPhone or Android device. Setting up the ring is as easy as downloading the app onto your phone, and all software updates are wirelessly transmitted to your Circular ring.    Built-in intelligence  We designed Circular to be an effortless, autonomous part of your daily life. There's no on/off button on the ring; it knows whether you are wearing it or not. Similarly, there's no need to notify the app nor the ring about what you are going to do. Circular knows when you go to sleep and when you do activities, and it uploads the subsequent data to your phone automatically. If your phone is not available, it can collect and store detailed data for up to 7 days.Body Signal processing  The ring collects the body signals it needs using its dual sensors (Heart Rate Sensor and Accelerometer). Circular contains a built-in processor that will process the data and send it by Bluetooth to the Circular mobile app for analysis. The Circular app uses machine learning to better understand your habits and offer a personalized experience.  Wave free during your sleep  Although the 2400 MHz to 2485 MHz radiation output of a Bluetooth device is negligible to your health, the Circular ring automatically goes into “sleep mode” when it detects a sleeping state⁠—meaning that it is functioning without Bluetooth during your sleep while still capturing your body signals. It will synchronize with the app when you get up.    The Sensors 
 A precise 3 Axis Accelerometer
 A red and Infrared Optical Pulse Sensor  
 Having infrared LEDs means that there are no blinking lights on the ring to disturb your sleep because our eyes cannot see infrared wavelengths of light.  Using Circular is simple (so simple you basically don’t have to do anything). Here’s how it works:   Here’s what our beta testers have to say about the Circular experience:  We think that wearables on the market are bulky, and most of them are gadget-looking. Because of that, we can’t wear our wearables at any moment. Watches and bands are uncomfortable at night, so we don’t like to sleep with them.

Not much luck finding shirts with any of the equipment military members are proud to use every day. So we had the idea of Aloha69!</p> <p><strong>What we’re doing:</strong></p>
<p>Aloha69 has the aim of providing awesome shirts that military members and their families will want to wear to display the awesome things they get to work on, around, and with! In doing that we also strive to be Made in the USA, sustainably sourced, and support military families. Shelby does all of the art for our designs, and a friend of ours who’s a military spouse sews all the shirts together. </p>
<p><strong>What we have to offer:</strong></p>
<p>At this point we are just starting out. For this campaign we’re offering a KC-135 shirt and an M4A1 Rifle shirt. However in the near future we’ll offer aircraft such as the F-16 Viper, T-6 Texan II, T-38 Talon, Apache Helicopter, and T-1 Jayhawk. We’re also working on equipment like radios and Abrams tanks! Those are just the Phase 1 design plans. So if these two shirts aren’t exactly what you want, get your gift card and know we’re working on your equipment! </p>

For Cinego, the filling factor is as large as 90%.What devices to Cinego and HOW?PS4/PS3 - HDMI 1.4ANintendo Switch/Wii - HDMIXBox One/360 - HDMIiPhone/Android Phones - Bluetooth, USBMacbook/Laptops - HDMI (but with a Lightning Digital AV Adapter)Google Play Store - WiFiNetflix/Hulu/Youtube - WifiSteam - WiFiVUDU -  WiFiDrones - HDMIKODI - WiFiWhat 3D formats does it support?Cinego supports the Side by Side 3D format, but is unable to produce a 3D image from a 2D image.What does 6 axis motion sensing mean?6-axis motion sensing means Cinego tracks your head movements, immersing you more fully in 360 Videos and VR content.Is Cinego VR compatible?Yes, Cinego is VR compatible. You are able to watch 360 videos and play VR GamesWhat OS does Cinego use?CInego uses Android 4.4 (Kitkat). We use KitKat because it’s one of the most stable version of Android ever released, supports every app and does not take up a lot of processing power or memory. If you have any questions, please send us an email to team@goovisg2.com",51.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>$59 stainless steel Apple Watch band? Are you serious?! Is that a typo?</h3>
<p>We strongly believe there is no better watch band material for the stainless steel Apple Watch than stainless steel itself. Unfortunately Apple's <a href=""http://www.apple.com/shop/product/MJ5J2/42mm-link-bracelet"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Stainless Steel Link Bracelet Band</a> costs $449 which can buy you another <a href=""http://www.apple.com/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Apple Watch Sport</a>. It is reported that the $49 Apple Watch Sports Band <a href=""http://www.geek.com/apple/49-apple-watch-sport-band-only-costs-2-05-to-make-1625665/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">cost only $2 to make</a> so it's fair to say that the $449 Stainless Steel Band would cost very much less to make. With no huge markups or expensive corporate overheads, we hope to bring you a similar quality stainless steel link bracelet band, crafted from the same 316L stainless steel alloy as the Apple Watch for only $59. We have started a small production and you can see the actual product in action in the video above. With your help, we aim to lower the cost of production further and make affordable stainless steel Apple Watch bands a reality!</p>

Our superior bracelet link design is extremely comfortable as it does not pinch at the skin or catch hairs. Our 316L stainless steel bands are also cooler to the touch, more breathable and more resistant to stains, sweat and odors than other rubber, fabric and leather bands.

<p>This product is for people wishing to explore further and are curious about the universe. We live in a global community where we can travel across the globe pretty easily compared to our ancestors, which means <strong>we spend a lot of time far from those that we care about</strong>. And<strong> phone calls are not always possible</strong> due to busy schedules and different time zones.</p>
<p>Sadly, now we are experiencing the other extreme, where our movement is restricted and so we have much less connection to those outside our homes. We understood that in both realities an <strong>enhanced sense of orientation, location, proximity and navigation</strong> is very relevant to our existing life and future as a species - how we move and connect to one another on our planet and beyond.  Sentero allows you to stay connected through personalized haptic stimulations. </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>It works like most of our senses, based on directional sensory input - when you look at something you see it, when you turn away you see something else. With Sentero when you <strong>turn to face the direction of a Nest you will receive a novel haptic stimulus (vibration)</strong>, giving you the new perception of their location through touch, wherever they may be on the planet.</p>
<p>Over time your brain learns to associate a specific vibration with the person or place you have chosen to sense, just as we learn to recognise a group of letters as a word. The haptic stimulus moves from being a conscious perception to an unconscious one, meaning you no longer have to think of what you are sensing you just know -<strong> creating an enhanced sense of orientation!</strong></p>

<p>At CyborgNest we invest in humans not machines, we strive to develop innovative technologies that expand your perception of the world. We experience the world through the input we receive from our senses. <strong>By adding new information we open up new capacities for our brain to think and create in novel ways.</strong> Because we can see we created architecture, because we can hear we created music, if we enhance our senses what might we be able to create? By creating sensory enhancement devices we open up human experience to include the hidden parts of nature which are thus far untapped by our natural senses. </p>
<p><strong>We aim to create technology that makes us more human</strong>, connecting us to the planet and to each other. While others invest in developing machines we dedicate our research to exploring human evolution, investing in humans and not devices.

<p>The perception of an enhanced human, or<strong> 'cyborg'</strong>, is often seen as the physical integration of technology and the human body. This vision predominantly comes from fiction, we see it slightly differently. After the release of the NorthSense we saw the impact it had on the owners perception of reality, augmenting their understanding of space and enhancing memory recall. It was clear that our <strong>focus should be on the affect our technology could have on the brain</strong>, which adapts to the new sensory input through neuroplasticity. Whether physically connected, implanted, or simply worn, devices mediate our perception of our world and create a hybrid cognition. </p>

<p><strong>THE SCIENCE OF ORIENTATION</strong></p>
<p>At its core, the Sentero provides an external spatial point of reference that extends your local, egocentric sense of space (what you see, hear and feel) to a global, allocentric sense of orientation. The result of having an allocentric spatial sense is especially apparent in cities or inside buildings. In these environments we rely on memory to maintain our orientation relative to the external world. However, spatial memory on its own is not reliable and can easily lead to getting lost or confused, so having a constant point of reference alleviates this issue and allows your mind to realign itself.</p>

<p>Having a permanent external spatial point of reference means that you intuitively link the relative orientation of different locations. In practice this means that you, for example, intuitively relate the orientation of your dining table at home to the orientation of your desk at work.</p>

<p>The device is designed to sit on your inner arm, <strong>forearm or upper arm</strong>, which enables you to feel the vibrations best and detect your heart rate. You can adjust the strap size to fit you, depending on where you would like to wear Sentero. </p>
<p>Sentero can sense directions when your arm is in a resting position (pointing downward) or if you reach your arm out to determine the direction of a Nest. </p>
<p>The most important thing is that you always wear it on the same spot so that your brain learns to associate each vibration with a Nest - over time becoming a new sense of orientation!</p>

</div></div>","Sentero is now being produced by our manufacturing partners RPD. Check out the images and video below which show the final device and how it works! 
 
The video below shows Sentero detecting 'NORTH' and triggering the haptic engine.

 
 

 

The simplicity of Sentero is the real value, feeling connected with a person or place when you are busy and time just flies by, Sentero keeps them into your conscious thought.
 

 

 





BACKED BY SCIENCE
Research has clearly demonstrated the positive health effects associated with touch and social interactions.
(see section below)
 

Sentero frees up your eyes so that you can explore the world around you - use Senteros directional haptics to navigate to new places, discover new experiences and enhance your gaming experience. 

 and more.....

Extending our senses will not only benefit us with new type of sensory input, but will also free our born with senses from them being overloaded by screens.

 
This product is for people wishing to explore further and are curious about the universe. We live in a global community where we can travel across the globe pretty easily compared to our ancestors, which means we spend a lot of time far from those that we care about. And phone calls are not always possible due to busy schedules and different time zones.
Sadly, now we are experiencing the other extreme, where our movement is restricted and so we have much less connection to those outside our homes. We understood that in both realities an enhanced sense of orientation, location, proximity and navigation is very relevant to our existing life and future as a species - how we move and connect to one another on our planet and beyond.  Sentero allows you to stay connected through personalized haptic stimulations.

The device extends your sensory reach beyond that of you visual field, allowing you to feel Nests that in distant locations.
 

Sense people and places when you turn to face them (left picture) or if you hold your arm out to scan for their direction (right picture).
 
It works like most of our senses, based on directional sensory input - when you look at something you see it, when you turn away you see something else. With Sentero when you turn to face the direction of a Nest you will receive a novel haptic stimulus (vibration), giving you the new perception of their location through touch, wherever they may be on the planet.
Over time your brain learns to associate a specific vibration with the person or place you have chosen to sense, just as we learn to recognise a group of letters as a word. The haptic stimulus moves from being a conscious perception to an unconscious one, meaning you no longer have to think of what you are sensing you just know - creating an enhanced sense of orientation!


Use the Sentero App to choose which Nests you want to sense and personalise the haptic patterns for each. 
Only connected wearers can consent to sense each other, and you can turn on/off others permission to sense you anytime. 
 

Sentero is a upgrade of our previous device NorthSense, which had 1 function - to sense the magnetic north. Sentero evolves from this with extra features.
See what the wearers had to say about their journey and why you should experience sensory enhancement with us!
 
 


Human Nests - You can sense the direction of your loved ones, such as your family, anywhere in the universe. If you decide to walk towards them, you will meet.
 
With 2 Sentero you have the added features of sending and receiving haptic emojis and sensing each other's heartbeat! 
BUT
While two is awesome, one Sentero is also great: You don't need to have 2 Sentero to enhance yourself and make the best out of this experience. With 1 Sentero you still have tonnes of great features - you can sense places and memories and still sense people who don't have a Sentero but have downloaded the app! 
 
           
Sentero creates a unique and personal way of connecting with someone in another city, continent or planet. With time, as you get used to someone’s heartbeat, you could also sense the differences in rhythm. What you feel is live and will allow you to understand their physical and emotional status.

Mass Connectivity - Connect as group to one person. Sense your yoga teacher when following a class from home. 
 

The ability to Sense the Magnetic North is always ON and connects you to the planet we live on. We experience the world through our senses - but they are limited. By adding a new perception of the magnetic field, like birds have, we open up our world to experience new realities.
 

Location Nests - You can sense locations that have meaning for you - home, your studio, a place of memories, and even the stars!
 


Sentero can sense anything that has gps coordinates, and using an API you can create new content for this sense which can be used for major industries, such as Gaming, VR, Social Media, Travelling … let your imagination flourish. You could then share your creation for other Sentero owners to use and enjoy. ​
 

You can choose to use Sentero in combination with the SiiD implant to enhance your cyborg experience. By injecting the programmable NFC chip you will receive extra features.
SiiD is not available on this campaign, but can be purchased separately, details on our website.
 
ADDITIONAL FEATURES WITH SiiD:
PHONE SOCIAL LINKTo close the loop, when a Nest is sensed, by tapping on your SIID implant with your smartphone you can trigger an app or web-link that links to the person or place we are sensing. Send them a message, call them, open a picture of you together or post something on their social media.
 

At CyborgNest we invest in humans not machines, we strive to develop innovative technologies that expand your perception of the world. We experience the world through the input we receive from our senses. By adding new information we open up new capacities for our brain to think and create in novel ways. Because we can see we created architecture, because we can hear we created music, if we enhance our senses what might we be able to create? By creating sensory enhancement devices we open up human experience to include the hidden parts of nature which are thus far untapped by our natural senses. 
We aim to create technology that makes us more human, connecting us to the planet and to each other. While others invest in developing machines we dedicate our research to exploring human evolution, investing in humans and not devices. Why spend so much time and money on making technology smarter, when we can make ourselves smarter?
 

 
WE HAVE BUILT A VERSATILE TEAM OF DIVERSE EXPERTS TO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE EXTRAORDINARY THINGS
 

 

 
 


 
We believe in disruptive technology which enables use to design our evolution. 
By expanding your perceptual field with smart senses you further unleash your brain’s potential to think and create in novel ways.
 
The perception of an enhanced human, or 'cyborg', is often seen as the physical integration of technology and the human body. This vision predominantly comes from fiction, we see it slightly differently. After the release of the NorthSense we saw the impact it had on the owners perception of reality, augmenting their understanding of space and enhancing memory recall. It was clear that our focus should be on the affect our technology could have on the brain, which adapts to the new sensory input through neuroplasticity. Whether physically connected, implanted, or simply worn, devices mediate our perception of our world and create a hybrid cognition. 
 
​
 

Neuroscience research has demonstrated that memories have a spatial grid-like representation suggesting that the mechanisms of spatial and episodic memory are similarly structured. In this case, having an additional sensory reference in spatial memory could improve both spatial and episodic memory encoding and retrieval.

Sentero locates you at the centre of your Cyborg Network, surrounded by the people and places that are important to you - we call these your Nests. 
If two loved ones choose to sense each other through the Sentero App - Sentero will vibrate when you are facing their direction, anywhere on the planet.
 
THE SCIENCE OF CONNECTIVITY
Research has clearly demonstrated the positive health effects associated with touch and social interactions. Sentero can increase your feeling of connectedness, help to minimise feelings of social isolation and thereby improve mental wellbeing. Whereas social media connections are abstract and therefore hard to concretise Sentero makes connections concrete, physical and directly relatable.
 

The ability to Sense the Magnetic North is always ON and connects you to the planet we live on, this acts as a cognitive anchor.
You can sense where your home is, or other locations that have meaning for you. You can navigate there like a bird.
 

 

 
THE SCIENCE OF ORIENTATION
At its core, the Sentero provides an external spatial point of reference that extends your local, egocentric sense of space (what you see, hear and feel) to a global, allocentric sense of orientation. The result of having an allocentric spatial sense is especially apparent in cities or inside buildings. In these environments we rely on memory to maintain our orientation relative to the external world. However, spatial memory on its own is not reliable and can easily lead to getting lost or confused, so having a constant point of reference alleviates this issue and allows your mind to realign itself.

Having a permanent external spatial point of reference means that you intuitively link the relative orientation of different locations. In practice this means that you, for example, intuitively relate the orientation of your dining table at home to the orientation of your desk at work.

 

The device is designed to sit on your inner arm, forearm or upper arm, which enables you to feel the vibrations best and detect your heart rate. You can adjust the strap size to fit you, depending on where you would like to wear Sentero. 
Sentero can sense directions when your arm is in a resting position (pointing downward) or if you reach your arm out to determine the direction of a Nest.
