I will stay in an artists' loft in Brooklyn, and travel out to Coney every day on the subway, photographing and drawing all that I see and immersing myself in this most inspiring place.</span></p><p>Since I first discovered it in 2002, I
have made 5 short 1-day pilgrimages to Coney
Island, on the shores of Brooklyn, New York City. Coney is a decaying
wonderland of dilapidated amusements and some of the most edible typography one
might endeavour to feast their eyes upon. I have kept scrapbooks of photographs
from each trip, which I use to inform illustration work and paintings. Yet,
each time I return via the Subway to Stilwell Ave, I am heartbroken to
find a little bit more of Coney has died since my last trip. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/192141/files/20131112041223-_MY_CONEY.jpg?1384258343"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><b>What I aim to achieve</b></p><p>This sabbatical will allow me to fully immerse myself in Coney Island for months on end; to experience a summer season, and finally see The Mermaid Parade. Due to being granted time off from work, I will be able to create without restraint, and experience being a full-time artist for the first time. I will create a body of work that will reflect Coney Island's present, as well as examining its history; and paint a portrait of an ever-changing environment that will serve as an interesting visual account of a moment in Coney Island's history in the future. I'll continue to develop this body of work upon my return to Australia, creating some large-scale paintings based upon my experience.<br/></p><p></p><p><b>What I'll need to get there</b></p><p>The funds raised will contribute towards airfare from Brisbane to New York (approximately £1,475), rent for 3 months (approx. £2,200), insurance (£300) and living costs whilst I am in Brooklyn, as well as any materials I will need. I won't be working (except for making great new Coney Art!) so I'll have no other income coming in during the 3 month residency. Even if I don't reach my full target, any funds I raise will be a valuable contribution and a helping hand in getting me to Coney Island.</p><p><b>I've done it before....</b></p><p>In 2011, I received a grant from The GCC Council to create this amazing quilt (below), with the help of designer Amy Lane. It won one award (Creative Review UK Best In Book for Illustration), and was nominated for another, and has toured London, Paris (twice!), Melbourne, Gold Coast and Ottawa on exhibition.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/192251/files/20131112050653-_MY_QUILT.jpg?1384261613"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Also, my previous crowdfunding project was 132% funded.

I have exhibited my work in London, Paris, Portland, New York, Ottawa, Adelaide, Melbourne and The Gold Coast, Australia. Here's some of my work:My Coney Island Dream...Next summer, I plan to spend 3 months in Coney Island, USA, in a self-initiated artist residency. I will stay in an artists' loft in Brooklyn, and travel out to Coney every day on the subway, photographing and drawing all that I see and immersing myself in this most inspiring place.Since I first discovered it in 2002, I
have made 5 short 1-day pilgrimages to Coney
Island, on the shores of Brooklyn, New York City. Coney is a decaying
wonderland of dilapidated amusements and some of the most edible typography one
might endeavour to feast their eyes upon. I have kept scrapbooks of photographs
from each trip, which I use to inform illustration work and paintings. Yet,
each time I return via the Subway to Stilwell Ave, I am heartbroken to
find a little bit more of Coney has died since my last trip. What I aim to achieveThis sabbatical will allow me to fully immerse myself in Coney Island for months on end; to experience a summer season, and finally see The Mermaid Parade. Due to being granted time off from work, I will be able to create without restraint, and experience being a full-time artist for the first time. I will create a body of work that will reflect Coney Island's present, as well as examining its history; and paint a portrait of an ever-changing environment that will serve as an interesting visual account of a moment in Coney Island's history in the future. I'll continue to develop this body of work upon my return to Australia, creating some large-scale paintings based upon my experience.What I'll need to get thereThe funds raised will contribute towards airfare from Brisbane to New York (approximately £1,475), rent for 3 months (approx. £2,200), insurance (£300) and living costs whilst I am in Brooklyn, as well as any materials I will need. I won't be working (except for making great new Coney Art!) so I'll have no other income coming in during the 3 month residency. Even if I don't reach my full target, any funds I raise will be a valuable contribution and a helping hand in getting me to Coney Island.I've done it before....In 2011, I received a grant from The GCC Council to create this amazing quilt (below), with the help of designer Amy Lane. It won one award (Creative Review UK Best In Book for Illustration), and was nominated for another, and has toured London, Paris (twice!), Melbourne, Gold Coast and Ottawa on exhibition.Also, my previous crowdfunding project was 132% funded. Your kind donations helped me to create 2 new decks of playing cards, which you can now get as a reward for helping me fund this project...!If you donate, I have some great rewards for you!**If your reward is intended to be a Christmas gift, I will ship it to you in time for Christmas, so long as you donate by December 6th.*** ALL worldwide shipping costs are included in the price of the reward!Here are some of the things you can get as a thank you for your valued support:Badges and Postcards (I will even send you one form Coney Island if you like!):Limited Edition 6-colour hand screen printed unisex tshirts:Unique, hand made, 1-of-a-kind ORIGINAL ART BMI (body mass index) badges:The VERY LAST 5 of the Pick Me Up 2012 at Somerset House Prints!BRAND NEW!

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1569709603/hfcwlyil0xaki7t5jknc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>My Story</strong></h3>
<p>I've been making mixed-media collage for more than a decade. A few years ago my art really took off and I began selling it here and there as well as informally teaching how to make mixed-media collage to others. I was an overworked full-time factory worker and as the job became more exhausting, my creative making became less and less. Last year I decided to make the leap of faith and quit my factory job and become a full-time creative. I now make and sell art, teach art at the local community college as well as at Vancouver Art Space, a wonderful creative outlet at our local mall that provides affordable art classes for folks.  I also lead creative retreats and provide one-on-one creative coaching and mixed-media collage instruction. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>One of the store front walls of Vancouver Art Space where I teach has been made available for a mural, the first ever of it's kind at the mall. I submitted a design concept based on the kind of art I make and it has been approved. The mall management has had  the wall prepped, but other than that, there is no budget nor compensation for the mural artist. Most artists have declined to pursue this project due to the lack of compensation and I understand and respect that.... however, I see an opportunity. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Commitment</h3>
<p>I have committed to making this mural. Installation begins November 14th. I forecast that it will take 3 full days to complete. </p>
<p>I'm asking my community to support me in this project for a few reasons : </p>
<ul>
<li>Supplies are expensive to cover this much square footage</li>
<li>Compensation for the artist esteems the value of the work the artist creates</li>
<li>It is a unique opportunity to paint a one-of-a-kind mural in a unique public space</li>
<li>It is a great investment of funds into a large project by a local full-time creative entrepreneur.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Risks</h3>
<p>The biggest risk for me is that I will make a terrible mural in a very public way.  I've never made a mural before, even though I have been making art for so many years.</p>
<p>I've  made the biggest works of my art career just  in the last several weeks and it went well. It felt good to have all that spaciousness to  fill up with creative goodness.</p>
<p>A mural will be the biggest creative challenge to date for me, and I love to be challenged. I like to expand my creative boundaries and discover what else I am capable of accomplishing.</p>
<p>It is a risk worth taking  for the only way to find out is to just go for it, right?!</p>
<p>The other risk is financial. I can put the supplies on my credit card and I can forego making any income for the three days I will set aside to make this mural, but these are not smart business decisions.</p>
<p>I am taking a risk that I may end up having to pay for all of this out of pocket and lose income while I create the mural.</p>
<p>I am taking a risk that my community might not want to support this kind of project.  But I think these are worthwhile risks that have potential for an amazing outcome.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>A Leap of Faith</h3>
</div><div>
<p>I could play it safe and let an opportunity like this pass me by. But just earlier this I journaled  that one of the things I desire to do is  Make a Mural.  I thought maybe a mural project would be in my future in the next couple years, but I was wrong. This opportunity is Here and Now ... I  HAVE TO GO FOR IT!</p>
<p>I am taking a leap of faith that my skills will serve me well as I tackle the 11x10 foot wall with my mixed-media collage design. I am trusting that it will turn out well and inspire patrons of the mall for the next year or two while the mural is in place. </p>
<p>I am also trusting that my community will step up and demonstrate support by contributing to this campaign, by contributing to the supplies I need as well as agree with me that an artist ought to be compensated for public art. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Be the Magic </h3>
<p>My art almost always features words that are meant to inspire and uplift the viewer. This mural is no different. </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Imagine. Dream. Create.</h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Be the magic the world needs. </h3>
<p> </p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Hello and Welcome to our campaign page!</strong></h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1547609509/xdc7yassnlr3v3hvt8tk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Who we are:</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We are a married creative couple who both received our Master of Fine Arts degrees from the University of Kansas, (where we met!), in 2013. Since graduating, we have been teaching, traveling, and making art throughout the United States. Throughout the summer, we travel to art festivals showing our work and demonstrating our process to the public. Our discipline is Traditional Printmaking; we use the process of silkscreen on paper to create a wide variety of imagery by hand.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What we are doing:</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Our campaign is to raise money for the build-out of a <u>Transit Ford Cargo Van</u>. With the money we raise, we will be able to retro-fit the van into both a cargo vehicle for our art, and a living space. We will be able to take our art on the road! The goal with the van is to be able to reach as many people with our art as possible.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">This is an image of the van we will be outfitting:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1547093917/w0c41qknxrzdrcrukd9f.jpg"" src=""""/></u></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">This is what our current vehicle looks like:</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>With your help</strong>, we will be able to reach farther destinations while being fiscally responsible, since we will be able to live out of our vehicle for days or weeks at a time rather than staying at hotels or Airbnbs. We will also be able to prepare and store food in our van as opposed to eating at restaurants for every meal.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What <u>WE</u> need:</h2>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">$2,050</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Our total financial goal is <strong>$2,050.</strong> This money will be used to take a completely stripped down cargo vehicle, insulate it, create walls, shelving, a bed-platform, and storage space for our artwork. This will help us build out the basic necessities to get us self-sufficient and on the road to tour with this new vehicle.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u>Since we will be a bit tight after purchasing the vehicle, this is where you come in!</u></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Financial Breakdown: i.e. how we will use the campaign money to build out the basics!</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Natural Wool Insulation - $340</strong> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Havelock Wool from Nevada. All-Natural, non-toxic sheep wool insulation that is superior in mold resistance and sound insulation. We will be using this in all of the walls and ceiling of the van. It is also a much better insulation choice for our bodies and the planet!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Reflective Thinsulate Rolls - $95</strong> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">US Energy Products creates this insulation that we will be using to insulate between the metal floor and our plywood interior floor, so we don't cook when we have to park in large, asphalt parking lots.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Formaldehyde - Free Plywood - $370</strong> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Columbian Forest Products makes this non-toxic, soybean based glue plywood that will let us sleep easy knowing we aren’t inhaling toxins while we are touring the country. This will be the main material we will be using to cover the insulated floors, ceilings and walls.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Lumber - $160</strong> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We will need various pieces of dimensional lumber to construct benches and cargo spaces within vehicle. It will be mostly pine for this understructure.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Hardware - $100 </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">This includes hinges, screws, bolts and anything else that we will be using while constructing our cargo area-basically the stuff that holds it all together.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Insect Screen for Back Doors - $470</strong> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">This product is made by Van Upgrades and will be really useful when we need to get fresh air into our vehicle while we are eating or relaxing for the night before the various art events.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Camco Standard Portable Travel Toilet 5.3 Gallon - $75</strong> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">When you have to go you have to go. This little guy will sit in a very tasteful bench in our cargo area just in case we have to go to the bathroom at night or on the road, and we don’t have any other options.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Advanced Elements 5 Gallon Solar Shower Bag - $30</strong> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We will use the power of the sun, water and some soap. ‘Nuff said.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>High-Efficiency Food Cooler - $310</strong> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">This will allow us to keep and prepare food in our van while we are at art events and on the road. This means we will have healthier, better quality, AND cheaper meals; yay!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Fees, packaging, and all that Jazz - $100</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">This will help to offset costs of packaging and shipping of perks, as well as Indiegogo platform fees, and credit-card fees.</p>

<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">If we don't make our entire goal we will have to prioritize what we get done on our van. The most important elements will be to <strong>insulate </strong>and <strong>build the bed platform</strong>, so we will focus the funding on these aspects. Some of the other items aren't a complete necessity, but would make traveling <strong>much, much easier.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">You will still receive your <strong>awesome perks</strong>, and we will still be able to have this incredible experience, but things will be a lot tighter.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Yes, but why should <strong><i>I </i></strong>contribute?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Here are<strong> 5 good reasons</strong> to donate to this campaign:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">1.

Who we are:
We are a married creative couple who both received our Master of Fine Arts degrees from the University of Kansas, (where we met!), in 2013. Since graduating, we have been teaching, traveling, and making art throughout the United States. Throughout the summer, we travel to art festivals showing our work and demonstrating our process to the public. Our discipline is Traditional Printmaking; we use the process of silkscreen on paper to create a wide variety of imagery by hand.
 
What we are doing:
Our campaign is to raise money for the build-out of a Transit Ford Cargo Van. With the money we raise, we will be able to retro-fit the van into both a cargo vehicle for our art, and a living space. We will be able to take our art on the road! The goal with the van is to be able to reach as many people with our art as possible.
This is an image of the van we will be outfitting:

This is what our current vehicle looks like:

 
With your help, we will be able to reach farther destinations while being fiscally responsible, since we will be able to live out of our vehicle for days or weeks at a time rather than staying at hotels or Airbnbs. We will also be able to prepare and store food in our van as opposed to eating at restaurants for every meal.
 

What WE need:
$2,050
Our total financial goal is $2,050. This money will be used to take a completely stripped down cargo vehicle, insulate it, create walls, shelving, a bed-platform, and storage space for our artwork. This will help us build out the basic necessities to get us self-sufficient and on the road to tour with this new vehicle.
Since we will be a bit tight after purchasing the vehicle, this is where you come in!
 
Financial Breakdown: i.e. how we will use the campaign money to build out the basics!
 
Natural Wool Insulation - $340 
Havelock Wool from Nevada. All-Natural, non-toxic sheep wool insulation that is superior in mold resistance and sound insulation. We will be using this in all of the walls and ceiling of the van. It is also a much better insulation choice for our bodies and the planet!
Reflective Thinsulate Rolls - $95 
US Energy Products creates this insulation that we will be using to insulate between the metal floor and our plywood interior floor, so we don't cook when we have to park in large, asphalt parking lots.
Formaldehyde - Free Plywood - $370 
Columbian Forest Products makes this non-toxic, soybean based glue plywood that will let us sleep easy knowing we aren’t inhaling toxins while we are touring the country. This will be the main material we will be using to cover the insulated floors, ceilings and walls.
Lumber - $160 
We will need various pieces of dimensional lumber to construct benches and cargo spaces within vehicle. It will be mostly pine for this understructure.
Hardware - $100 
This includes hinges, screws, bolts and anything else that we will be using while constructing our cargo area-basically the stuff that holds it all together.
Insect Screen for Back Doors - $470 
This product is made by Van Upgrades and will be really useful when we need to get fresh air into our vehicle while we are eating or relaxing for the night before the various art events.
Camco Standard Portable Travel Toilet 5.3 Gallon - $75 
When you have to go you have to go. This little guy will sit in a very tasteful bench in our cargo area just in case we have to go to the bathroom at night or on the road, and we don’t have any other options.
Advanced Elements 5 Gallon Solar Shower Bag - $30 
We will use the power of the sun, water and some soap. ‘Nuff said.
High-Efficiency Food Cooler - $310 
This will allow us to keep and prepare food in our van while we are at art events and on the road. This means we will have healthier, better quality, AND cheaper meals; yay!
Fees, packaging, and all that Jazz - $100
This will help to offset costs of packaging and shipping of perks, as well as Indiegogo platform fees, and credit-card fees.

$1000

Also present will be a bubble machine. Really. I mean, you gave us 1000 bucks, how could we NOT give you bubbles?  1 available
 
What If we Don't make our Goal?
 
If we don't make our entire goal we will have to prioritize what we get done on our van. The most important elements will be to insulate and build the bed platform, so we will focus the funding on these aspects. Some of the other items aren't a complete necessity, but would make traveling much, much easier.
You will still receive your awesome perks, and we will still be able to have this incredible experience, but things will be a lot tighter.
We really do believe that this campaign is totally achievable. With your help we can make this dream a reality!
 
Impact & Mission Statement
Yes, but why should I contribute?
 
Here are 5 good reasons to donate to this campaign:
1. You get a chance to support artists so they can CONTINUE TO CREATE and travel the country sharing their journey with you through social media and newsletters; every dollar that gets donated is a dollar we don’t have to spend time worrying about, and instead we can focus on making the van comfortable so we can make and sell incredible work.
2. You get to tell all your friends that you are an arts supporting philanthropist (High-fives all around!)
3. You will get cool stuff! (Who doesn’t love that?)
4. Your name will be posted on the internets as a supporter of the campaign and the arts.
5. You will have our undying gratitude!

This campaign's success will push us towards a dream we have had ever since starting Midnight Oil Studio & Workshop 3 years ago: travel the country together while sharing our artwork and process with as many people as possible.
   Our Core Beliefs

Art and expression has the ability to bring and spread joy and compassion.
Traveling fundamentally changes how we understand and interact with the world.
Creating and learning how things are made, (understanding process), brings fulfillment.

Helping us reach our goal will give us the ability to travel and share our passion for traditional printmaking, as well as the natural world around us. Connecting with people and sharing our love of the natural world is something we have come to love about our careers as traveling artists.
 

Risks & Challenges:

    itty-bitty living space!
The cargo vehicle, once retrofitted, will be full to the brink, so every cubic inch counts!
Challenges for this project include careful planning and construction of the interior van space and making it all work as smoothly and efficiently as possible. Thankfully, Jonathan has a carpentry background, and Allison is very talented at planning out projects step-by-step so no details are overlooked. With these skills and aptitudes, we know, that with your help, we will be able to build-out our van in a way that allows us to be very comfortable and successful when we are on the road.

There may be challenges, 
but this project is worth the risk.
We are confident in our abilities as artists and know that we have an excellent support base of friends, family, and followers!

<p>     Grünewald's 'Madonna of the Garden, with its life size main figures and cosmically lit rural landscape is located amidst the similar village surroundings of Stüppach, Germany in its small parish church there. This is the work to be re-done, in oil painted replica mirror reversed, that will comprise the project's integrated left half. An onsite visit to do this is required. Not simply to copy but to understand its strategies well enough to make the fusion of the worlds as flexible and alive in the final work as the fusion between the divine and mundane are in the Madonna and Child painting alone.</p>

<p>    Baroda, Gujarat was where nine months of 2015/16 was spent completing the previous Indiegogo funded project mentioned above. During that time I gained acquaintance both with the place and with its great people. It's also there that have access to space around 5km from the area to be fused with the radiant landscape of the Grünewald. So that while working there I can be close to the work's 'midst'. I learnt a great deal last time. This time I hope to be able, in sharing this work (and its creation) with Baroda's art community as it proceeds, to give back. </p>

A lot of people got inspired by the installation of what he was working on at MSU's Fine Arts Hall here. I request people to understand how intense he is in this place.

To realize this on the ground familiarity is involved; first an examination of the Grünewald in the tiny farm hamlet of Stüppach, Germany and then in Baroda (a.k.a. Vadodara), India within which the work will also be accomplished.
Who We Are


and


 
In a German Hamlet

     Grünewald's 'Madonna of the Garden, with its life size main figures and cosmically lit rural landscape is located amidst the similar village surroundings of Stüppach, Germany in its small parish church there. This is the work to be re-done, in oil painted replica mirror reversed, that will comprise the project's integrated left half. An onsite visit to do this is required. Not simply to copy but to understand its strategies well enough to make the fusion of the worlds as flexible and alive in the final work as the fusion between the divine and mundane are in the Madonna and Child painting alone.
                                                                         
                                        In Modern India
   

    Baroda, Gujarat was where nine months of 2015/16 was spent completing the previous Indiegogo funded project mentioned above. During that time I gained acquaintance both with the place and with its great people. It's also there that have access to space around 5km from the area to be fused with the radiant landscape of the Grünewald. So that while working there I can be close to the work's 'midst'. I learnt a great deal last time. This time I hope to be able, in sharing this work (and its creation) with Baroda's art community as it proceeds, to give back.

moved from NYC to Portland Maine to see if art could change a city. I’ve been
an activist and theater artist since high school. For decades, I resisted
identifying as an artist but after years of traditional activism mixed with
community-engaged performance projects, I finally had to face the fact that
something happens in live theater/performance that doesn’t happen anywhere
else. A place gets created where people can realize/connect/remember/decide
things about themselves, the world and each other…the sorts of things that end
up changing lives. </p><p>The idea that’s become “<a href=""www.artatwork.us"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Art At Work</a>” came to me
while I was thinking about the scale of challenges we are facing in the world
and how innovative, sustainable solutions would very likely be local. <b>The idea was to put creativity to work
improving a city’s municipal government by tackling non-arts community problems
by designing and implementing arts projects. </b>The basic goal was that art
could help cities save money, deepen residents awareness and expectations of local
government, and increase the sort of pride among neighborhoods and residents
that leads to robust civic engagement. </p><p><b>IMPACT</b></p><p>Since 2007, police officers have turned around
historic low morale by partnering with local poets and writing over 100 poems
about their work. Public Service construction workers have become more
welcoming by sharing stories about their own heritages and carving prints that
hang in their workplaces. Officers and poets came together twice for community-wide
civic dialogues about the role of the police in Portland, dialogues that began
with a poetry readings. The workers who take your money at the parking garage, City
Hall treasury, and library desk have written stories, essays, and poems about
themselves and their work which were turned into posters that hang next to the
elevators, counters and hallways where they work. It’s not been very easy, but
it has been hugely rewarding. </p><p>Two years ago, the police found themselves in over
15 rock &amp; bottle-throwing confrontations with teenagers angry about the shooting death of an armed man by police officers. The police chief called to ask if I would write
and direct a play with officers to perform for high school students. So I asked
him to make sure that I bot to work with the department’s toughest officers. After
multiple ride-alongs, interviews, workshops and rehearsals, the performance –
Radio Calls – was performed by five officers at all 3 Portland high schools. It
had a transformative impact on the relationship between the officers and the
students, particularly immigrant and refugee students, who are a significant part of
our community.</p><p><b>OUR STORY
and VIDEOS</b></p><p>You can see excerpts from “Radio Calls” below
along with several other videos from different projects. The Public Services
Construction Crew talking for the first time ever to the public about the
effect of being stereotyped as a ‘shovel leaner’ and the pride they take in the
work they do, as artist Katarina Weslien connects street repair and Jackson
Pollock. Or (then) lieutenant, who is now our Police Chief, reading his poem
and talking about the impact of Art At Work from his perspective. And finally, internationally-respected
graffiti artist Tim Clorius, a part of “Good Fences for Good Neighbors” which
helped bring our city’s Somali mosque and the East Bayside Neighborhood Organization
together.</p><p><br/></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""435"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/G9par1f_Za4?feature=oembed"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p><p><br/></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""326"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/gSLEpOxoQ3c?feature=oembed"" width=""580""></iframe></div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""326"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/sa3-CkKCHLY?feature=oembed"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""326"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/BkfOyjt2hFM?feature=oembed"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""326"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/bb6FBKr5IUU?feature=oembed"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p></p><p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p><p>We’re asking for your help – money, outreach,

experiment going in Portland but also help spread what we’ve learned to other
cities, artists, and communities. We now have an Art At Work Holyoke. We hear from London UK, Austin TX, &amp; Danbury VT that AAW ideas are making a difference. Some of the 2014 projects that we've been developing with city staff, grassroots leaders, and elected officials --- “<b>All The

response to real time events and challenges, sort of a “a true reality show” as coined
by our newspaper The Portland Press Herald.</p><p>We wanted the perks to offer a meaningful connection and
to reflect the nature of the work we do. They include original Police Poetry

<p>I invite you
to participate in an artwork that merges ethics with aesthetics, a project that
fuses together cultural creation with civic action, painting with philanthropy.</p>
<p>This June in
Hammond Louisiana, I will be working with a group of students at Southeast
Louisiana State University to build a colossal installation of painted and
printed lumber, a towering, three-dimensional mural that will be exhibited in
the University gallery there. After the exhibition we will disassemble the
structure and then give the painted and printed lumber to The Ginger
Ford Northshore Fuller Center for Housing (A Habitat for Humanity affiliate) where
they will use the lumber in the
construction of a new home for a struggling family.</p>
<p>While many
artworks incite contemplation of their subject matter, often causing a
rethinking of social problems of our time, this artwork will go one step
further and tangibly serve to help the community by becoming the raw materials
for the construction of a home.</p>
<p>I need the
help of patrons/donors who want to simultaneously support the arts and give a
struggling Louisiana family a boost by donating lumber for this project. I hope
to utilize four thousand dollars worth of lumber in this project (about the
total dimensional lumber used in the construction of a two bedroom home) and
hope that you or your company or someone you know might be interested in
contributing a portion of that total.</p>
<p>In order to
make this a reality, to have a profound impact, to reach a kind of critical
mass that I believe can be inspirational, I am asking for donations of all
sizes. Of the $4,000 that I hope to gather, 100% of your donation will go to
one concrete element of this project, the lumber. For every $20 that you give,
I will purchase seven two-by-four studs or three twelve foot long two-by-six
joists. Donations of lumber would work as well as financial gifts. The gallery
at Southeast Louisiana State University is providing some funding for materials
(screws, paint, metal joining hardware, etc.). While my goal is to generate
$4000 worth of lumber, if that goal is not met completely, even a partially met
goal will result in a powerful artwork and an important gift to Habitat for
Humanity.  </p>
<p>In the past
year I have carried out two previous, smaller-scaled projects that involved
partnerships with Habitat for Humanity (one in Memphis and one in Lexington,
KY). This is the first time that I have crowd-sourced the funding for materials
and I am excited to open the project to a wider body of participants. It is
also my hope that this project will generate a sufficient quantity of painted,
printed lumber to completely transform the look of the framed home to be
something that will be awe inspiring. A significant motivation of this project
is to bring excitement and energy to the organizations that are carrying out
this important work across the country (and the world).</p>
<p>If you are
interested and want to help in a way that is not financial, I will be seeking
volunteers to help to paint and to construct the artwork (both in Memphis in
the month of May and in Hammond in June). Feel free to contact me if you are
interested in participating in any way. If you can't financially back this project but find it exciting and want to help out, please share this with your friends!</p>
<p>Thank you

<h3>Where Your Money Goes</h3>
<p>Your donation will first go toward the cost of keeping the venue open the week prior and nights of the exhibition. Queen Ave has graciously blocked out this time from other events so we can build out the event. We're opening the doors the previous weekend to help everyone install their creations, rig up lighting and projection, and get a feel for the space. Throughout the rest of the week our participants will tweak and modify their creations until the time of the show.</p>

Where Your Money Goes
Your donation will first go toward the cost of keeping the venue open the week prior and nights of the exhibition. Queen Ave has graciously blocked out this time from other events so we can build out the event. We're opening the doors the previous weekend to help everyone install their creations, rig up lighting and projection, and get a feel for the space. Throughout the rest of the week our participants will tweak and modify their creations until the time of the show.
Just like any event, after venue costs are subtracted the rest will be distributed to the participants.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We are the BAM! Toronto Youth Slam Team for 2012-2013, otherwise known as BTdot. We consist of many talented poets with many accolades and slams under their belt. We have been invited to compete at Youth Speaks - Brave New Voices 2013 in Chicago! With the help of our coaches <strong>Brian Millado</strong>, <strong>Patrick De Belen</strong> and <strong>Marcus Lomboy</strong>, we're hoping to bring crazy fire to Chicago this year at Brave New Voices and the other events we hope to competing at! This is a dream come true for all of our poets and we would appreciate any help that you can provide to help us get there! </p>
<p>Here is a little bit about our members:</p>
<p><strong>Saredo Mohamed</strong> is a 17 year old poet from London, Ontario, Canada. She ventured into spoken word poetry in Grade 11, where she continued to present and compete at BAM! Toronto Youth Slam. Saredo became the BAM! Toronto Youth Slam Grand Slam Champion for the 2012-2013 season, and has been featured in an article by Metro newspaper. Saredo uses her experiences with race, immigration and travel as inspiration for her work, and hopes to inspire others with her poetry.</p>
<p><strong>Ray Abergas</strong> is an 18 year old poet from Scarborough, Ontario, Canada. He is also the captain of the BAM! Toronto Youth Poetry Slam team, BTdot. He combines his relentless passion of helping others, poetry and performance to mold the person he is today. Ray has performed for a number of organizations like UNITY charity, UNIFFECT, Kapisanan Philippine Centre for Arts and Culture and RISE poetry. When asked about why he loves spoken word poetry, he replies: ""I think words can save lives and that's what I want to do"".</p>
<p><strong>Jacob Agustin</strong>, better known as his stage name JaayRoyy. He is an 18 year old spoken word poet and rapper, born and raised in Toronto, Ontario. He writes because he not only loves the adrenaline he gets on stage and the freedom he feels when expressing himself but to also change lives and influence positive attitudes, especially to youth. Jacob is an active member in UNIFFECT and UNITY charity.</p>
<p><span class=""messageBody""><span class=""userContent"">Hailing from Toronto, Ontario, <strong>Karel La Guardia</strong> is climbing his way up among the top youth poets in his city. His writing style is largely influenced by his personal experiences. Trying to take inspiration from all his surroundings, his poetry can take you along a journey about his ambitions, his struggles, and maybe even his breakfast (most likely his breakfast). When he's not gracing the stage with his poetry, Karel is an avid music listener, video game junkie, and works toward getting his high school diploma and ultimately into the field of teaching. Karel's passion for music, poetry, and bacon composes his whole being (but mostly bacon).</span></span></p>
<p>At the age of 17, <strong>Berma</strong> is a wordsmith who's passion cannot be questioned. As a member of Spoken Ward, UNIFFECT, and BTdot, he has honed his ability to perform and enjoys spilling his soul on the stage. At a young age, Berma encountered many hardships only to come out stronger. He uses his words to speak out on issues that affected him and to help those who are dealing with the same things. Whether its talking about sports, music, or even the weather, Berma is a character that can't be missed.</p>
<p><strong>Blaze</strong> is a poet from Guelph, Ontario, Canada. She became involved with Guelph Spoken Word at a young age and has not looked back ever since. She is one of the youngest poets to ever represent a team on national stage. She has also organized and hosted many youth festivals such as Youth in Unison and Inferno festival where the main event is a giant team poetry slam.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>The Breakdown</strong></h2>
<p><strong>The $1500 that we hope to raise will go towards:<br/></strong>- Event Registration Fees <em>(Fun fact: Brave New Voices, the largest youth slam festival in the world, has a $1250 team registration fee alone!)</em><br/>- Transportation<br/>- Lodging<br/>- Food, supplies, etc. </p>
<p><strong>Funds collected will be divided up towards the fees (registration, lodging, travel, etc.) of the following spoken word events and festivals:<br/>- Youth In Unison 2</strong>: June 29 (Guelph)<strong><br/></strong>-<strong> SLAMtario</strong>: July 12-13 (Toronto)<br/>- <strong>Brave New Voices</strong>: August 7-11 (Chicago)<br/>- <strong>Canadian Festival of Spoken Word YouthCanSlam</strong>: August 20-25 (Ottawa)<br/>- <strong><em>And </em></strong><em><strong>more to be announced!</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong> </strong></em></p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>Spoken word poetry is an artform that almost anybody can do and is accessible to everyone. You don't even need a pen and paper. All you need are your thoughts. Spoken word poetry can cover any issue: race, violence, immigration, you name it. Your voice is the most powerful tool that you can ever use. As poets, we want to show youth that you can use poetry to save yourselves from the problems that you have on a daily basis. Spoken word poetry saves lives, and some of our poets are living examples of that. </p>
<p>By supporting us, you're helping us show the world our voices. You're supporting a cause that is trying to change lives for the better and maybe even save a life. We are trying to raise awareness on topics that we feel aren't getting enough attention, as well as telling our stories and the stories of people who have inspired us and moved us in so many ways. </p>

<p><strong>SUPPORT THE B.TDOT / BAM! TORONTO YOUTH POETRY SLAM TEAM OF 2012-2013! </strong></p>
</div></div>","Introduction
We are the BAM! Toronto Youth Slam Team for 2012-2013, otherwise known as BTdot. We consist of many talented poets with many accolades and slams under their belt. We have been invited to compete at Youth Speaks - Brave New Voices 2013 in Chicago! With the help of our coaches Brian Millado, Patrick De Belen and Marcus Lomboy, we're hoping to bring crazy fire to Chicago this year at Brave New Voices and the other events we hope to competing at! This is a dream come true for all of our poets and we would appreciate any help that you can provide to help us get there! 
Here is a little bit about our members:
Saredo Mohamed is a 17 year old poet from London, Ontario, Canada. She ventured into spoken word poetry in Grade 11, where she continued to present and compete at BAM! Toronto Youth Slam. Saredo became the BAM! Toronto Youth Slam Grand Slam Champion for the 2012-2013 season, and has been featured in an article by Metro newspaper. Saredo uses her experiences with race, immigration and travel as inspiration for her work, and hopes to inspire others with her poetry.
Ray Abergas is an 18 year old poet from Scarborough, Ontario, Canada. He is also the captain of the BAM! Toronto Youth Poetry Slam team, BTdot. He combines his relentless passion of helping others, poetry and performance to mold the person he is today. Ray has performed for a number of organizations like UNITY charity, UNIFFECT, Kapisanan Philippine Centre for Arts and Culture and RISE poetry. When asked about why he loves spoken word poetry, he replies: ""I think words can save lives and that's what I want to do"".
Jacob Agustin, better known as his stage name JaayRoyy. He is an 18 year old spoken word poet and rapper, born and raised in Toronto, Ontario. He writes because he not only loves the adrenaline he gets on stage and the freedom he feels when expressing himself but to also change lives and influence positive attitudes, especially to youth. Jacob is an active member in UNIFFECT and UNITY charity.
Hailing from Toronto, Ontario, Karel La Guardia is climbing his way up among the top youth poets in his city. His writing style is largely influenced by his personal experiences. Trying to take inspiration from all his surroundings, his poetry can take you along a journey about his ambitions, his struggles, and maybe even his breakfast (most likely his breakfast). When he's not gracing the stage with his poetry, Karel is an avid music listener, video game junkie, and works toward getting his high school diploma and ultimately into the field of teaching. Karel's passion for music, poetry, and bacon composes his whole being (but mostly bacon).
At the age of 17, Berma is a wordsmith who's passion cannot be questioned. As a member of Spoken Ward, UNIFFECT, and BTdot, he has honed his ability to perform and enjoys spilling his soul on the stage. At a young age, Berma encountered many hardships only to come out stronger. He uses his words to speak out on issues that affected him and to help those who are dealing with the same things. Whether its talking about sports, music, or even the weather, Berma is a character that can't be missed.
Blaze is a poet from Guelph, Ontario, Canada. She became involved with Guelph Spoken Word at a young age and has not looked back ever since. She is one of the youngest poets to ever represent a team on national stage. She has also organized and hosted many youth festivals such as Youth in Unison and Inferno festival where the main event is a giant team poetry slam.
 
The Breakdown
The $1500 that we hope to raise will go towards:- Event Registration Fees (Fun fact: Brave New Voices, the largest youth slam festival in the world, has a $1250 team registration fee alone!)- Transportation- Lodging- Food, supplies, etc. 
Funds collected will be divided up towards the fees (registration, lodging, travel, etc.) of the following spoken word events and festivals:- Youth In Unison 2: June 29 (Guelph)- SLAMtario: July 12-13 (Toronto)- Brave New Voices: August 7-11 (Chicago)- Canadian Festival of Spoken Word YouthCanSlam: August 20-25 (Ottawa)- And more to be announced!
 


The Impact
Spoken word poetry is an artform that almost anybody can do and is accessible to everyone. You don't even need a pen and paper. All you need are your thoughts. Spoken word poetry can cover any issue: race, violence, immigration, you name it. Your voice is the most powerful tool that you can ever use. As poets, we want to show youth that you can use poetry to save yourselves from the problems that you have on a daily basis. Spoken word poetry saves lives, and some of our poets are living examples of that. 
By supporting us, you're helping us show the world our voices. You're supporting a cause that is trying to change lives for the better and maybe even save a life. We are trying to raise awareness on topics that we feel aren't getting enough attention, as well as telling our stories and the stories of people who have inspired us and moved us in so many ways.

<p>“Art Day Celebration,” is a creative art program of Diakonos International 501(c)(3) that cultivates and empowers impoverished and underprivileged children in Haiti. Our mission is to bring healing, restore hope and nurture the spirits of poverty-stricken children through the arts, building a platform where they can showcase their artistry. The goal of <em>Art Day Celebration</em> is to provide children from poor communities and developing countries access to quality visual and performing arts in the four domains of creative art; Music, Movement, Art, and Drama.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The “Art on Canvas” annual event workshop in July is designed to nurture underprivileged children through explorations of<span> the creative art in the painting</span>. </p>
<p>Now in its second year, “Art on Canvas” is looking to fulfill the children’s expectation shaped by their experiences during our inaugural year. Utilizing the arts to bring hope through creativity, ADC team works together with disenfranchised children to guide them into exploring various forms of art and developing an appreciation for life through a series of art activities which offer opportunities to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide them a new set of skills for self-expression and communication.</li>
<li>Discover their creative abilities and develop their individual artistic talent.
<ul>
<li>Use the analytical skills learned to empower them to blossom into fully functional, self-reliant and productive members of their society.</li>
<li>Motivate them to find their purpose in life.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><p>The Community will also benefit from sponsored fundraising art exhibitions to help develop sustainable projects and establish a scholarship fund for participating children. 85% of the sale of each child’s original artwork benefits the children directly and their education costs. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Last year<span style=""color: #0000ff;"">'</span>s (2012) “Art on Canvas” workshop had close to 150 children from orphanages, tent cities, and local underprivileged children in the city of Carrefour.  </em><em>The 2 day event held at the Centre <span>de </span>Sportif de <span>in</span> Carrefour was packed with painting, dancing, a D.J., Haiti news presence, eating and pure fun.</em><em>.

<p><strong>SOME BACKGROUND INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p><em>Art Day Celebration is a program for Diakonos International 501(c)(3), that offers a fresh and dynamic approach to help confront the orphan and homeless crisis in Haiti through the creation of a Family Home called </em><a href=""http://diakonosintl.com/127386.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>“KOMINOTE TI FANMI NOU de DIAKONOS”</em></a><em> (meaning “Our small Community of Family”).

<p><em>Diakonos’ pioneer Wilfrid Longchamp had been a Diaspora living in California as a Computer programmer and after being diagnosed with an autoimmune disease, he decided to move to Haiti by the encouragement of his sister Martine Longchamp, Co-Founder of Diakonos.

<p>The DutchMill is an interactive public art piece that will represent the people, culture and art of the Netherlands at the Black Rock Arts Festival (aka Burning Man) as part of the Circle of Regional Effigies, or C.O.R.E. The project seeks to create one of the most familiar symbols of the Netherlands by errecting a large Windmill on the Playa and we feel very proud to have been accepted as a CORE project by the Black Rock Arts Foundation and given an initial grant to get started.</p>
<p>However, the amount of the grant is not enough to make this project and our dream come true! We need funding from people like you <br/>to help make this unique art piece happen.</p>
<h2>Details of the Project</h2>
<p>When people think of the Netherlands one of the most frequent symbols of the country is the windmill. The Dutch people have been embracing man of the 10 Principles of Burning Man such as Radical Inclusion, Community/Civic Responsibility, and Immediacy through working together to reclaim their country from the sea for hundreds of years. As such we feel that a Dutch Mill is the perfect representation of the Dutch Burners and a great fit for our first (of hopefully many) CORE projects.</p>
<p>The project will be designed and built through a collaboration of local Burners and Artists with the actual construction done in the US and will use donated recycled wood as much as possible. We have already partnered with the Reno CORE project and they have graciously offered to allow us to work along side them in Reno with their tools and workshop space. Additionally, they will be able to help us in purchasing the wood and transporting it to the festival.</p>
<h3>Appearance</h3>
<p>Our project will be a very unique piece on the Playa not only in that it will be a collobartion of work done in two countries, but also in the overall appearance of the piece. Rising out of the baren salt flat dessert will be a structure that is covered in brilliant colors and vibrant lights at night. The outside of the piece will be covered in fabric and be strikingly different from the cutout wood and painted pieces that tradditionally mark CORE projects. This innovative decoration style will not only be unique but serves to solve one of the biggest problems of the project. How can we allow all the artists and participants in our project in the Netherlands help in decorating a piece built in the US? The fabric pieces will allow the art to be done locally and then added to the piece during assembly. Artists will paint on large sheets of cloth and these sheets will be stretched across the panels of the base of the mill as well as the geodesic dome top.</p>
<p>The structure itself will have an octagon shaped base in tradditonal style. The front three panels of the door, and two adjacent sides will be painted in a large abstract mural by Daniella Rubinovitz (<a href=""http://www.daniellarubinovitz.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.daniellarubinovitz.com/</a>). Next two these panels on opposite sides will be two panels with the flag for Amsterdam and the Netherlands painted at the top. During our fundraising parties and decoration events we will invite all attendees to complete the phrase, ""When I think of the Netherlands/Amsterdam, I think of..."" All the thoughts and feelings captured will then be shared with the participants on Playa. Additionally, the bottom half of these panels will be left blank so that they can be filled in by participants at the festival. The next two panels will be decorated by local artists in the Netherlands. Finally the last panel (opposite the door) will not be a white fabric covering but will be a huge flag made out of shiny metallic fabric that will shine bright in the sun of the desert during the day and our LED flood lights at night.</p>
<h3>Beautiful Inside and Out</h3>
<p>Our project is not just beautiful on the ouside, but meant to be a place of sanctuary and museum to Dutch art and culture. The inside will be open with a couple of benches so that people can sit and relax with local music played through a very small sound system. This music would include classical (Willem Pijper), traditional Dutch (folk) music, Jazz (Han Bennink), as well as modern dance music from our world famous DJs such as DJ Tiesto, Paul Van Dyke, etc.</p>
<p>In addition to the music inside, we hope to have pieces of art from artists displayed that help to capture the culture and history of the Netherlands. Paintings, Photography, small sculptures, whatever an artist wants to donate to the project that helps to share their vision of the Netherlands will gladly be shared inside (and returned if wanted).</p>
<p>Lastly, we will are playing with the idea of having neon colored string inside that is stretched in intrique patterns around the walls. These will glow brilliantly with black light inside the piece and can be rearranged easily by visitors to form their own shapes and designs.</p>
<h3>Shining Bright in the Night</h3>
<p>One of the most amazing aspects of Burning Man is the vivid colors and lights at night. Our project will be radicially illuminated in a few ways. First, each of the blades will be brightly illuminated in a softly changing flood or color by a strip of LEDs down the entire length. Second, the entire outside will be illuminated with soft white flood lights shining off the colorful fabric sides. Finally, the inside will be lit with black light and glowing objects inside. If extra funds are available we would like to have a laser shoot out of the top of the project as well.</p>
<h3><strong>How your Donation will help!</strong></h3>
<p>In order for our project and vision to happen we need help funding it. There are many pieces of the design that will be quite expensive. Here is a quick run-down of the expected costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wood for construction - €500</li>
<li>Lighting and illumination - €300</li>
<li>Sound / music - €200</li>
<li>Fabric / markers / paint - €200</li>
<li>Transporation costs - €400</li>
<li>Interior decorations / materials - €400</li>
<li>Clean up / tools - €200</li>
<li>Contingency - €200</li>
<li>Fundraising gifts - €100</li>
</ul><p><strong>TOTAL ESTIMATE - €2500 (about $3300 USD)</strong></p>
<p>Additionally, many of the people involved in this project will be paying for their own costs to arrive in the United States and stay there for many weeks to build the project. These people are DONATING THEIR OWN TIME AND MONEY and we are not asking you to fund their airfare or time away from their family and friends to make this happen.</p>
<h3>What do you get for your donations?</h3>
<p>Well in addition to helping make this project happen and sharing it with tens of thousands of festival goers, you will get the following commemorative momentos for various support levels.  NOTE- Donations are accepted in EUROS and DOLLARS, we choose to go with US Dollars for our campaign because it has less fees and doesn't require a PayPal account.</p></div>","Overview

<h3>Who am I-</h3>
<p>I am the owner and operator of Morticia's Mermaid Tails. We are very big on supporting and encouraging children, or anyone for that matter, that they can be and do anything they put their mind to. It is our goal to make them think, and to believe that there are greater things than what they are told. I have a tattoo that has very personal meaning, and I entirely stand behind what it says. It says, ""Never be afraid to be you"". This might come as a shock to some, especially adults, when I say that I AM a Mermaid.</p>
<p>This summer, I was able to attend a Pirate event known as Seadog Nights and Gypsy Carnival. Myself and a few others brought a pool and we set up a mermaid lagoon. It went over AMAZINGLY well. I brought joy and wonder to the lives of children, adults, and even the elderly. Some problems we had, some children were so small, and the pool was so tall, that they could not see inside. They either tried to climb on the pool (yikes!), or had to be lifted.</p>
<h3>What we need-</h3>
<p>After the event was over, we started planning for next year. Our plans included a more realistic tail, and a clear sided swim tank. Any funding recieved for this program will go directly towards the purchase of the tank, which due to the size will be custom built, and the trailer for it to be transported on. The tank will be aproximately 8'x4'x4', which will make it just large enough to perform in. And having it clear sided will allow for all ages to see the mermaid swimming inside. </p>
<p>We have found a local business, Pioneer Plastics in Albany OR, to commission the tank from, thus giving more back to the local community. The tank will be used free of charge to the events that it is intended to be used at, including numerous Pacific Northwest Events (which consist of pirate fairs, ren fairs, and gatherings).</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Even if we do not meet our goal, all funding will go towards the purchase of the tank. If we should happen to get more than our goal, the excess will be put towards paying off a small portion of the Realistic tail that I have been making payments on since May. </p>
<p>There will be many perks/rewards available to those who donate. They will start out small, and increase in worth. Ranging from Pictures with the mermaid, to a personal visit from the mermaid.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact-</h3>
<p>This will have a greater impact that one might think. There will be an impact on children, and adults of all ages. It will make them think, imagine, and most importantly- Dream. Some of the greatest people in our history were dreamers. We volunteer our time to be at these events, no one pays us to be there (9 times out of 10, WE pay to be there).</p>
<p>And this project wont only affect local people, people come from all over the states to attend events here in the Pacific North West. From all overs of the US, Maine to Florida, to Cali, and even to the British Columbie.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help-</h3>
<p>There are dozens of other ways you can help out. The most important one being- Help us get the word out! That will help our project reach further, and reach more people willing to donate to a cause. This is not about us, it is about raising the imaginations, and childrens abilities to dream.</p>

<p><strong>What have I got planned?</strong></p>
<p>MotherSoulProject will take still shots this year to and from my journey - away from routine suburban motherhood - to and from Burning Man at Black Rock City, NV to benefit women and children globally THIS WEEK :)  Images gathered will be exhibited and gallery sold with the goal of awakening the spirit of art and beauty and with the hope of passing along the indelible aspects of trust, integrity and gratitude.  50% of proceeds from approved image sales will be donated equally to Peaks Foundation and Global Watch Children's House - to benefit children in Africa/Asia/South America and India, respectively.  In return, I am looking for help to travel to location, and making a promise aloud to donate locally as well.  <strong>What's this got to do with you? </strong> Well, if it awakens even a few more people into knowing they can be adventurous and help someone besides themselves, it is surely worth it.</p>
<p>Both at home, and globally, (our) children are watching and the time's come to overtly exemplify how to care for our fellow humans, near and far; <strong>I'd like to help share the vitality of art and gratitude wrapped up in one great project and am hoping this will be the first of many projects to do so.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is MotherSoulProject?</strong></p>
<p>The MotherSoulProject is for all to share and know that each and every one of us is entitled to wander, run or jump outside of what often seems like overbearing mediocrity and a prescribed experience… Turn on the tv, go to work, come home, cyberrelate, consume.  It's an ""iLife"" for most but guessing if you've read this far, you know there exists more to life than the hamster wheel.</p>
<p>MotherSoulProject began as a thought, then a brief blog and hopes to evolve into formal not-for-profit work with women and children combining the spirit of adventure and giving.  MotherSoulProject loves the power of one’s intention and how far it can bring someone!  Through writing, image gathering, sharing and purposeful adventuring, I want to inspire women and girls to use their imagination, as well as their hearts to travel through meditation, writing, imagery, art and/or by actually leaving the routine for something valuable and inspirational every now and then!</p>
<p>I thought of the MotherSoul concept while folding laundry a few years ago and wondering how ""it"" was all going to get done (procuring, cleaning, cooking, picking-up, studying, giving, teaching, exercising, loving, decompressing, etc.) with bells on.  I was actually frightened of failing at all this ""stuff""...I breathed deeply, a few yoga breathes and the stress dissipated.  Afterward I focused on how truly lucky I was to have these issues.  I also realized that part of the reason for so much stress about these basics was that I felt I was squandering my efforts that might be bigger and better...Ahh, the plight of women in the modern world.  (In truth, it is ALL important!)

<p>In thinking of what to do this Autumn, I considered hiking with Peaks Foundation in Nepal to raise funds for Classroom in the Clouds.  Amongst charity races and donation drives, it felt like a big trip would be a wonderful accent to efforts my family made this year, but alas neither schedule not budget would yield to my desire for extended travel to Asia.  A number of other things came up but none seemed to jibe.  <strong>In conversation one day I asked a friend about Burning Man and whether or not she felt it was a transformative experience...whether it helped her or the human race in any way...she was convinced it did, if only for helping to push the envelope on ideas of love, art and self-reliance.</strong></p>
<p>Interestingly, a few weeks later another friend offered me their 2012 ticket. (Well, actually he asked that I pay him for it, and I did.)  <strong>And once that check was written, it felt like I had won the golden ticket to Charlie's Chocolate Factory where I might find wisdom in unlikely, bedazzled places should I dare take the first step in...sign the contract and ride the Wonkavator, so to speak.</strong>  A massive 180 from the last days of summer in New England.</p>
<p><strong>I've procured a camera, some basics for the event and the wavering permission of husband, kids, boss, friends... but need assistance with two big ticket items for the trip - airfare and rental car (or a Wonkavator.) </strong> My campaign request is for these two items.  I have the other costs (food, bicycle - to be cleaned and donated upon leaving Reno - water and lemonade to be shared with those on the playa, and gallery image preparation) covered! </p>
<p><strong>Who will benefit?</strong></p>
<p><strong>The promise</strong> <strong>is that images gathered will be hung at a gallery in CT for sale this Autumn with 50% of proceeds being offered to charity.</strong>  As mentioned, there are 2 organizations I have keen interest in - one is the Peaks Foundation (<a href=""http://www.peaksfoundation.org"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">www.peaksfoundation.org</a>) based in Africa - but helping women and girls in Africa, Asia and South America.  And the Global Watch Children's Home based in Tamil Nadu, India that pulls at my heartstrings:  (<a href=""http://globalwatchfoundationchildrenshome.org/Welcome.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">http://globalwatchfoundationchildrenshome.org/Welcome.html</a>)  I visited Tiruvannamalai last year and walked hand in hand with a small group of beautiful children who I know will benefit from bicycles, clean water, education and health care - just as we all do.  The indelibility of small gestures, donations and a thread of love in their direction makes incredible difference.  At home, my daughter and I have agreed to make more frequent donations to the women's shelter as well.</p>
<p><strong>To summarize my reasons for all of this...</strong></p>
<p><strong>My daughter SEES everything. I'd like to exemplify to her and her peers that helping others can be easy. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Thanks for considering this concept for MotherSoulProject.  I will send every donor a poetic postcard.  And will make wishes for all of us that we make the best of this whole ride.</strong></p>

<p> </p></div>","What have I got planned?
MotherSoulProject will take still shots this year to and from my journey - away from routine suburban motherhood - to and from Burning Man at Black Rock City, NV to benefit women and children globally THIS WEEK :)  Images gathered will be exhibited and gallery sold with the goal of awakening the spirit of art and beauty and with the hope of passing along the indelible aspects of trust, integrity and gratitude.  50% of proceeds from approved image sales will be donated equally to Peaks Foundation and Global Watch Children's House - to benefit children in Africa/Asia/South America and India, respectively.  In return, I am looking for help to travel to location, and making a promise aloud to donate locally as well.  What's this got to do with you?  Well, if it awakens even a few more people into knowing they can be adventurous and help someone besides themselves, it is surely worth it.
Both at home, and globally, (our) children are watching and the time's come to overtly exemplify how to care for our fellow humans, near and far; I'd like to help share the vitality of art and gratitude wrapped up in one great project and am hoping this will be the first of many projects to do so.
What is MotherSoulProject?
The MotherSoulProject is for all to share and know that each and every one of us is entitled to wander, run or jump outside of what often seems like overbearing mediocrity and a prescribed experience… Turn on the tv, go to work, come home, cyberrelate, consume.  It's an ""iLife"" for most but guessing if you've read this far, you know there exists more to life than the hamster wheel.
MotherSoulProject began as a thought, then a brief blog and hopes to evolve into formal not-for-profit work with women and children combining the spirit of adventure and giving.  MotherSoulProject loves the power of one’s intention and how far it can bring someone!  Through writing, image gathering, sharing and purposeful adventuring, I want to inspire women and girls to use their imagination, as well as their hearts to travel through meditation, writing, imagery, art and/or by actually leaving the routine for something valuable and inspirational every now and then!
I thought of the MotherSoul concept while folding laundry a few years ago and wondering how ""it"" was all going to get done (procuring, cleaning, cooking, picking-up, studying, giving, teaching, exercising, loving, decompressing, etc.) with bells on.  I was actually frightened of failing at all this ""stuff""...I breathed deeply, a few yoga breathes and the stress dissipated.  Afterward I focused on how truly lucky I was to have these issues.  I also realized that part of the reason for so much stress about these basics was that I felt I was squandering my efforts that might be bigger and better...Ahh, the plight of women in the modern world.  (In truth, it is ALL important!) After that turning point, I began to focus energy differently and dialed into a vitality I didn't know I had.  I found focus that encouraged venturing out of the routine.  Feeling lucky, I took the time to learn more about how I might help others along the way.  MotherSoulProject emerged, and I felt an intense need not to squander my efforts to idle stress or unjustified discontent. 
Burning Man Backstory - I need a Wonkavator...
In thinking of what to do this Autumn, I considered hiking with Peaks Foundation in Nepal to raise funds for Classroom in the Clouds.  Amongst charity races and donation drives, it felt like a big trip would be a wonderful accent to efforts my family made this year, but alas neither schedule not budget would yield to my desire for extended travel to Asia.  A number of other things came up but none seemed to jibe.  In conversation one day I asked a friend about Burning Man and whether or not she felt it was a transformative experience...whether it helped her or the human race in any way...she was convinced it did, if only for helping to push the envelope on ideas of love, art and self-reliance.

My campaign request is for these two items.  I have the other costs (food, bicycle - to be cleaned and donated upon leaving Reno - water and lemonade to be shared with those on the playa, and gallery image preparation) covered! 
Who will benefit?
The promise is that images gathered will be hung at a gallery in CT for sale this Autumn with 50% of proceeds being offered to charity.  As mentioned, there are 2 organizations I have keen interest in - one is the Peaks Foundation (www.peaksfoundation.org) based in Africa - but helping women and girls in Africa, Asia and South America.  And the Global Watch Children's Home based in Tamil Nadu, India that pulls at my heartstrings:  (http://globalwatchfoundationchildrenshome.org/Welcome.html)  I visited Tiruvannamalai last year and walked hand in hand with a small group of beautiful children who I know will benefit from bicycles, clean water, education and health care - just as we all do.  The indelibility of small gestures, donations and a thread of love in their direction makes incredible difference.  At home, my daughter and I have agreed to make more frequent donations to the women's shelter as well.

<h3>Putting heART into our ART</h3>
<p>We are Cat on a Leash Creations, and we want to celebrate Valentines Day the only way we know how: By gathering artists from across the province into a historic building  to perform, create, and explore all that's weird, wonderful and unwanted about love.</p>
<p>The event is HeARTvark, and the goal is to gather community into one house so they may view love through the eyes of others (and enjoy a few drinks and some weird and wild art at the same time). We will be using the historic John Snow House in Calgary, AB to be home for a variety of artists for 3 nights in February. In each room there will be a different performance or installation that celebrates the ongoing mystery that is love and coupling. </p>
<p>But we need your help to aid in this project!</p>
<h3><strong>Tell Them What They Get!</strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>Like all wonderful public events, producing HeARTvark comes with operational costs. It is our aim to hand over our door sales to the many wonderful artists involved. </span><span>Our artists are dedicated, passionate individuals who are bringing talent, experience, and what they can find in the back seat of their cars to this eclectic event. With your help, we can offer these important members of our community a bit of cash to pay for their time and talent.</span></p>
<p>The money raised will go to:</p>
<p><span>-Operational costs like publicity, liquor licence and supplies.</span></p>
<p>-Purchasing materials for the artists</p>
<p>-Rental, which goes to The New Gallery of Calgary who maintain the historic home, it's archives and the antique printing press.</p>
<p>And anything else to make this a Valentines experience you can not pass up.</p>
<p>We also have special packages for various amounts donated!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Your Impact</h3>
<p>Whether it's $10, or $30, we are thankful for any funds that you can spare. As artists, we understand the value of a dollar which is why we would be so thankful for any contribution that can help HeARTvark really take off. </p>
<p>By bringing all mediums of art together into one home, we hope to remind people of the feeling of community, creativity, and of course love. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>But hey, if you can't afford the cost, just spread the word! Tell your friends, family, lovers, acquaintences, and frenemies about HeARTvark. Don't hesitate to stop on by for the performances at 7:30 PM on February 14th-16th at the Historic John Snow House.</p>

<p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>Bridget and I have been working non-stop in order to complete
the gallery exhibition we have planned. The shooting has been wonderfully
fantastic. Each time we go into the studio we walk out with stunning works. We
are incredibly exited to give you the first look at what our series will look
like. We realize it might have been a hard sell without anything to show so
here they are. We have selected a few images to share that will give the best
sense of the direction we are headed. The show will have a number of poster-sized
prints adorning the walls of Room 202, the gallery space provided by the University
of Central Florida. </p>
<p>We are going to make this; but only just. We currently have raised
enough to cover the printing expenses and we are running out of time. We know
that many of our friends are poor artists like the two of us so we only ask you
to share our campaign. Please if you could either pass on a few dollars, for
which you will receive a beautiful print from our series, or share this with
someone who can. Bridget and I are relying on our fans. We need your help. </p>
<p>We only have a few days left. Don’t delay! </p>
<p>Thank you for the love of art,</p>
<p>And thank you to our fans.</p>

<p>Your contributions to this project will not only fund this project, an embodied experience of sharing the planet with both human and non-human lives -- but will also generate connections for my students in the world of Land Art which they will explore for years to come. <br/></p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Trans-species Repast Family Dinner needs funding for transportation and lodging in Northern Europe as we contact collaborators and collect bicycles.  We need funding for food, plane and train fare and publication of this project. <br/></p>
<p>In total we need $6,423. With many frequent flier miles donated by my loving family and my own credit card from many years ago, we will fly all of us from Albuquerque to London. The majority of the airfare is from Albuquerque to New York City which is $1700 for the four of us. We will stay overnight in London, ($400), fly  from London to Geneva, and Geneva to Copenhagen, ($94) where we will stay for four days ($375) to buy second hand bicycles, figure out food, and tighten up our gear and buy local maritime grass plugs and seed. A Eurail pass for the four of us ($310) gets us to Hanstholm with our bicycles. We spend four days participating in the LandShape Symposium, with fees, lodging and food ($750). For two weeks from June 7-22, we will ride bicycles about 20 miles every day, from Hanstholm to Grenaa along the North Sea Trail, camp in different locations and share meals with the people and animals we meet at the Symposium, and some more we meet along the way. (camping fees $100, food $1000)  Where possible, we will build tables from sand on the beach and plant them with local dune grasses to encourage shoreline stabilization. (grass plugs $400) On June 23, we will leave from Grenaa on the east side of the North Jutland Peninsula and use our Eurrail pass to return to Copenhagen, where we will spend a night ($100) and then fly to Edinburgh.  At the beginning and end of this trip, I have created opportunities to meet with colleagues in Landscape Architecture, Art &amp; Ecology and Art at the University of Art and Design in Geneva, and the Edinburgh College of Art.  Those expenses are not in this campaign as they should be funded by UNM. </p>Everyone who reads this gets eternal gratitude and if you want you can read our blog. If you fund this project, you will receive postcards along our way, of the animals we meet and the foods we serve.  If you really fund us, we will send you audio and video clips along the way.  If you really really fund us, we will send you a cook book.  If you really really really fund us, we will make you a custom table and ship it to you. If you really really really really fund us, we will come make a dinner for you and your animals and leave a custom table.
<p><br/></p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal, we will still do this project.  The frequent flier miles tickets have already been purchased getting us to Europe.  We don't have the tickets to get to New York City, but you can make that possible!  We will start with those tickets and then move to the other pieces of travel that make the project possible. <br/></p> <ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>This project is about understanding how all biotic life can be ""at the same table"" in the face of difficult times for our planet and our cultures.  In more ways than ever we are linked across distances, across time.  This project seeks to build on that connection through the medium of the family dinner.  The dinner allows us to engage with the landscape as a common medium.  </p>
<p>I believe in this project.  The experience of sharing meals with animals
 for me has been transforming. I really see the world differently when 
we are interacting at the same table. I enjoy finding out where their 
tastes and mine overlap.  My perception of time shifts and changes. We all recognize a different pace of life in the biotic forms around us.  I want to open this experience to many people.  The LandShape Symposium will be publishing this project along with the 10 winners of their competition and it is a wonderful opportunity to be recognized and have this work be visible.<br/></p>
<p>In creating bonds to other programs, this project will also benefit students of the University of New Mexico as I create more ties to cultures and experiences they can experience through trips and study abroad opportunities. <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>There are some very real risks in this project. We could get stranded.  Someone could get hurt cycling. We could run out of money. I think we will rely on the kindness of strangers, as we all do, if any of these things happen.  We will keep our children and the children of others safe.  That is the most important promise I can make to you if you fund this project.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>If you can't contribute money, we understand utterly.  We wouldn't be asking for money if we didn't need it.  If you could share this campaign, that would help immensely.  If just one more person sees this who might be touched to contribute that is so valuable.<br/>

<p><i>Surface to Structure</i> will take place at The Cooper Union, located at 41 Cooper Square, New York, NY, 10003. The exhibition will be free and open to the public from June 19 – July 4, 2014.</p>
<p>The Cooper Union was the site of the 1959 exhibition <i>Plane Geometry and Fancy Figures</i>: the first origami exhibition in the United States.  One of its primary contributors was Lillian Oppenheimer, founder of The Origami Center, which later evolved into OrigamiUSA.  The exhibition included the works of Akira Yoshizawa, Giuseppe Baggi, Ligia Montoya, Robert Harbin, Robert Neale, and other notable artists.</p>

Surface to Structure will take place at The Cooper Union, located at 41 Cooper Square, New York, NY, 10003. The exhibition will be free and open to the public from June 19 – July 4, 2014.

For the first time in 55 years, origami will be brought back to The Cooper Union in the Surface to Structure exhibition.  In addition to presenting a small number of pieces folded by the same artists in the 1959 exhibition, the folded forms on display will show origami’s transformation,  including sculptures that push the boundaries of this artform beyond its traditional perceptions.  The exhibition will feature the work of established artists as well as up and coming artists and communicate the range and complexity of origami styles.Why We Need Your Help:We will be receiving over 120 works of art, most of which are from artists overseas, and we need to cover the cost of round trip shipping for all of the artwork.  To protect the artwork against loss or damage, we will provide insurance for all the pieces.  Your donations will also enable us to hire technicians to aid in the installation process.  Funding will go toward the purchase and construction of pedestals, shelves, or frames to display the origami, as well as protective casing.  To ensure that there is proper security during this exhibition, we are hiring a security personnel to be present at all times the gallery is open.  Your donations will help cover printing costs for information labels about the artwork accompanying each piece, and signs with information about the different genres of origami showcased.  We are hiring a photographer to take pictures of every work exhibited in the gallery, and these photos will all be printed in the catalog to document the show. Perks for DonatingNote: All images are concepts only and do not necessarily depict the final product.Happy Dance ($5):Our love, appreciation, a virtual hug, and a shout out tweet.Virtual Love ($10):A full resolution wallpaper for your desktop, and a video with digital diagrams for how to fold the Rose Auditorium, designed by Uyen Nguyen.Good Morning ($15):A coffee mug printed with your pick from one of the four crease patterns below.A Folded Year ($15):One full-color 12-month calendar for the year 2015.  Each month will feature a high-resolution photo of origami artwork from Surface to Structure .                                          Surface to Structure T-shirt ($25):A super-awesome origami-themed T-shirt, with your choice of one from three designs!Exhibition Catalog ($30 - $35):The official catalog of Surface to Structure: Folded Forms, with over 150 pages containing full-color, high-resolution photographs of every work from the exhibition and an essay written by Peter Engel.Coffee Break ($40):Full set of four coffee mugs, featuring each of the four available crease patterns.

</div> <div> <h3> about..Maurycy Lozinski.</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Maurycy wurde am 27. Juni 1980 in Jelenia Gora/Polen
geboren. Im Alter von 9 Jahren emigrierte er nach Wuppertal/Deutschland wo er
noch heute lebt und als freischaffender Künstler tätig ist. Bewegt von einem
Zeitungsartikel über Max Ernst und fasziniert von der Abbildung des Hausengels,
besucht Maurycy 2002 ein Düsseldorfer Museum um oben genanntes Gemälde im
Original zu sehen. Manisch und ungehemmt beginnt er zu malen. Die
darauffolgende unaufhaltsame Entwicklung und Vielfalt seiner
expressionistischen Werke, <span>verdankt der
Autodidakt ab 2004</span> auch zu einem großen Teil seinem
Atelierkollegen, dem Musiker und Typografen Hans Reichel. Es entsteht nicht nur
eine tiefe Freundschaft, sie manifestieren gemeinsam ihr bedingungsloses
Vertrauen mit der für Maurycy bisher wichtigsten Ausstellung in der
Stadtsparkasse Wuppertal unter dem Titel „Hans Reichel ft. Maurycy“.</p>

<p>Für den Künstler und die Polnisch-Deutsche Freundschaft steht das Ziel im Vordergrund, herausragende künstlerische Arbeit zu präsentieren. Risiken gibt es keine.

<p>Der erzielte Betrag wird ausschließlich für Produktionskosten aufgewandt und dient dazu, den Künstler Maurycy in einer neuen Erscheinungsform zu präsentieren. Sollte der Betrag erreicht werden, steht einer Veröffentlichung des Kataloges zum 06. Dezember kaum noch etwas im Wege. <br/></p>
<p>Die Erstausgabe würde im Rahmen der Veranstaltung ""Polnisch-Deutscher Freundschaftsabend"", am 06. Dezember 2014 erscheinen. <br/></p>

dass gewählte Format des Zeitungsdrucks in der Größe 32,5 cm x 52 cm bietet
eine hochwertige Kunstsammlung im kompakten Format. 






  What you give & what you get.
 
Der Künstler hat sich bewusst für die Finanzierung,
Erscheinungsform und die dadurch resultierende nähe zum Betrachter entschieden.
Durch das Zeitungsformat und die lose Bindung der Einzelseiten überlässt
Maurycy seine Kunst dem Zufall. Eine Zeitung kann von Vorne nach Hinten oder
von Hinten nach Vorne, aus der Mitte zum Ende und vom Ende zum Anfang
betrachtet werden. Es bleibt so jedem Einzelnen überlassen, wie er seine
Sammlung sehen möchte. 
Die Druckkosten der ersten 50 Exemplare belaufen sich
auf einen Gesamtbetrag von 600 Euro. Weitere Produktionskosten wie Editorial,
Layout, Probedruck belaufen sich auf einen Betrag von etwa 300 Euro. Ein
Gesamtbetrag von 900 Euro ist für diese Kampagne zu erreichen.
Als Anreiz vergibt der Künstler seltene Skizzen,
Zeichnungen und Malereien. 


   about..Maurycy Lozinski.


Maurycy wurde am 27. Juni 1980 in Jelenia Gora/Polen
geboren. Im Alter von 9 Jahren emigrierte er nach Wuppertal/Deutschland wo er
noch heute lebt und als freischaffender Künstler tätig ist. Bewegt von einem
Zeitungsartikel über Max Ernst und fasziniert von der Abbildung des Hausengels,
besucht Maurycy 2002 ein Düsseldorfer Museum um oben genanntes Gemälde im
Original zu sehen. Manisch und ungehemmt beginnt er zu malen. Die
darauffolgende unaufhaltsame Entwicklung und Vielfalt seiner
expressionistischen Werke, verdankt der
Autodidakt ab 2004 auch zu einem großen Teil seinem
Atelierkollegen, dem Musiker und Typografen Hans Reichel. Es entsteht nicht nur
eine tiefe Freundschaft, sie manifestieren gemeinsam ihr bedingungsloses
Vertrauen mit der für Maurycy bisher wichtigsten Ausstellung in der
Stadtsparkasse Wuppertal unter dem Titel „Hans Reichel ft. Maurycy“.





What if..?

Für den Künstler und die Polnisch-Deutsche Freundschaft steht das Ziel im Vordergrund, herausragende künstlerische Arbeit zu präsentieren. Risiken gibt es keine. Die Finanzierung des Projektes durch die Initiative ""PDF - Polnisch-Deutsche Freundschaft"", unterliegt einer völligen Transparenz und keinerelei gewinnorientierter Handlung. 
Der erzielte Betrag wird ausschließlich für Produktionskosten aufgewandt und dient dazu, den Künstler Maurycy in einer neuen Erscheinungsform zu präsentieren. Sollte der Betrag erreicht werden, steht einer Veröffentlichung des Kataloges zum 06. Dezember kaum noch etwas im Wege. 
Die Erstausgabe würde im Rahmen der Veranstaltung ""Polnisch-Deutscher Freundschaftsabend"", am 06. Dezember 2014 erscheinen.

</div></div>","Our Story
My name is Greta Bach and I am an MFA student in Chicago.  This project is the final project for one of my classes.  Below is the artist statement for the project:
 
I use art to investigate, educate, and inform.  Life is about connections, person to person and thought to thought. It is an unending web, a puzzle to untangle.  While my interests and art travel divergent paths that fork, twist, and turn, they do converge again a little later in the journey.  The thread that ties my areas of interest together is investigation.  After scrutinizing something to my satisfaction I then use my knowledge to inform, edify, or engage the viewer.  
 
I use my work to explore connections, convolutions of thought, and private things made public. The human mind is expansive and fascinating. I explore the cracks, crannies, and cobwebbed corners and I try to find ways to connect with and bring viewers into these spaces between thoughts.  The essential purpose of many of my projects is to give the subject as well as viewers a “peek inside one’s head” and perhaps create some self-awareness.  
 
I have been intensely fascinated by psychology and the workings of the human mind as well as its connection to brain structure and chemistry for years.  Recently I have become interested in divination and chance operations.  This proposed project will tie my interest in psychology to my interest in divination/chance operations.  
 
It is currently untitled, but the premise is a divination set based on an ancient Taiwanese method of fortunetelling and the Myers Briggs archetypes.  Each set will be letterpress printed using photo-polymer plates, and will contain 15 “sticks” with symbols which correspond to a haiku in the accompanying book.  The sets will also contain instructions for use, and three cowry shells.  These will be placed in handmade boxes featuring the wax seal of the artist on the cover.  
 
There are sixteen Myers Briggs archetypes and I have written a haiku for the top fifteen traits of each type.  Each of the 240 haikus is unique, so those archetypes with overlapping traits have individual haikus.  The tailoring of the “answers” (or haikus) to each personality archetype puts the response of the “forces that be” into language that the querent can easily understand.  They also draw attention to personality traits that may help or hinder the querent in the situation in question.  Again, creating self-awareness and offering another perspective for the viewer or participant.
 
The larger project will be the 16 divination sets, one for each archetype (though there will be multiples of each type).  The smaller “giveaways” portion of the project will be small pamphlets with seven or eight haikus from each archetype—a “sampling” for each archetype.

This is the budget for ""speaking in tongues"".  I need help paying for the supplies to do this project.  The goal is $600.  If i do not meet this goal, I will beg, borrow, and/or steal the remainder.  However, by doing things this way, I am opening it up for others to get involved.  So, get involved!  There are fantastic perks for doing so, including:
 
$10--A handwritten letter of gratitude with a myers briggs haiku (you can specify the archetype if you wish)
 
$20--A ""Casting Lots"" divination set.  Based on a hoodoo divination ritual this set includes 4 shells, letterpress printed instructions, and a pressure printed image
 
$100--A ""Speaking in Tongues"" haiku pamphlet.  It will include 8 letterpress printed haikus handbound in a pamphlet (you can specify the archetype for this as well!)
 
$200--A ""speaking in tongues"" set.  The finished piece!  Specify your archetype and you will receive 3 cowry shells, 15 ""sticks"", a handbound book of haikus, and instructions (all of which will be letterpress printed) in a handmade box with the wax seal of the artist on the lid.

<span style="""">Hello my name is Correna Carleen Smith and I am so excited to present to you my project The Artist Emerges: A 90 Day Journey To Higher Creativity and Healing.  I believe that people can heal through art.  This has certainly been true for me in my life.  Let me tell you a little bit about how this project was created.  About two and a half years ago I was having a difficult time dealing with the pain of my abusive childhood.  A friend gave me the number of a counselor.  At my first appointment with this counselor she put a can of crayons in my hand and said ""put color to your emotions.""  I wasn't really sure what that meant, however I began to color.  The emotional release that I experienced from that was amazing to me.  I went and bought a set of paints the next day.  At that time in my life I had never painted and knew nothing about it, except that It made me feel good when I would do it.  As time went on I began to heal through painting and art.  I began to work with an amazing artist and teacher named Elizabeth Preston and through painting and creative journaling I began to heal and I found what I believe is my life's purpose. To help others heal through art. Essentially art therapy.   The Artist Emerges is a 90 day journey in which I will use the tools and teachings laid out in the Artist's Way book by Julia Cameron, to discover and recover my creative self fully.  Each week I will commit to daily morning pages, to weekly reading, a weekly artist date, and completing weekly tasks.  I will also paint one original painting to represent the breakthroughs, insights, healing, or spiritual growth that occurs through this process, as well as one painting at the completion of the 90 day's to represent the entire journey.  Once this journey is complete I will have thirteen original paintings that I will use to hold my first solo art show called ""The Artist Emerges.""  With the proceeds from that show I will enroll in school to get my degree in Art Therapy and begin helping the world heal and grow through art.</span><br/>

The completed drawing will ship flat and well-secured. I can also email you a high-resolution digital scan of the drawing if you'd like. 

Risks & Challenges
Since the project is entirely complete aside from printing/assembly, the only foreseeable setbacks would involve production/shipping delays on the part of the manufacturers I'm working with. I used the same companies for the first pressing and had nothing but good results, so I don't anticipate there will be any issues. On the off-chance that any setbacks do occur, backers will be notified immediately. I've maintained a 5-star seller rating on Etsy for several years and I have a team of wonderful family & friends who are kind enough to pitch-in if I need any help keeping on schedule.",2.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>ANUBIS is a 50' high wooden combustible sculpture for Burning Man 2012.  We are raising money to build, ship and reassemble at Black Rock City for the Burning Man Festival 2012.  We will build the piece at NIMBY in Oakland, CA with a team volunteers.  This money is to be used solely for construction materials and construction space leasing.  No individual compensation for labor or expertise is being levied or paid through this project.</p>

Inspired by real life and fictional iconic characters, the Photographs serve as a time capsule that captures the essence of familiar imagery while dealing with issues of gender, sexuality, celebrity and more. 

 Since the begining the efforts have always been collaboarative with a variety photographers, make-up artists and graphic designers. The series has been co-sponsored by Club Card Printing who have put out thousands of the different postcards since the very piece ""Farrah Fawcett"". The cards have made their way around the globe and even into some of the hands of the Icons themselves. Bruce LaBruce even photographed his own tribute image.

 In 2003 One Point Six Gallery in Vancouver hosted the debut exhibit entitled ""Venus Rising"" which had 18 images and was covered by Fashion Television. In 2010, The Grace Gallery did an Icons and Demigods show with over 50 peices and videos. The entire project has never had funding and has, to date, relied on thye donated time and talent of various collaborators. 
 In order to continue devloping the ongoing series further, we are hoping to garner the basic costs associated with new work. Any money raised will cover expences for sets, costumes and to pay the contributers working on the shoot. With your support, the project can continue with new images and be exhibition-ready for upcoming shows and an eventual coffee table book.

WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU'LL GET
We are hoping to raise $5000.00 to create 15 more pictures  to cover minimum expences from beginning to end. We gratefully accept all donations but with any $100.00 and up you will recieve an 8.5 by 11 signed image of your choice of existing images. For $500.00 or more you get a signed autograph and additionally, you can choose from and icon from the list below who you would like to see be re-created first. New image possibilities include:
Cindy Lauper		Kate Bush		Bauhaus		Kylie Minogue		           Pet Shop Boys		General Idea		Dianna Ross		Joni Mitchell                                              Prince 			Madonna		Skinny Puppy		Twiggy		              Elvira			John Waters		Divine			Twink Peaks	                   Joe Dellesandro	Peter Berlin		Whiteney Houston	I Dream of Genie Missing Persons	The Ramones		The B-52's		Gordan Lightfoot           The Sisters of Mercy	Mink Stole		Candy Darling		Stevie Wonder  	 Mick Jagger	                Jerry Hall		Wham			Cindy Sherman               Alanis Morrisette	Elvis			James Brown		We Can Do It                       National Geographic   	Dukes of Hazzard	Nash The Slash		Gary Newman	               Mitsou           		Wayne Gretzsky	Peter Gabriel		RuPaul	                                          Michael Alig         	Lady Bunny		Brooke Shields		Sweenie SIsters                           Scott Thompson               David Suzuki		Platunim Blonde	Super Girl                   Michael- Arch Angel	Splash			Birth of Venus		Bonnie and Clyde

 In 2003 One Point Six Gallery in Vancouver hosted the debut exhibit entitled ""Venus Rising"" which had 18 images and was covered by Fashion Television. In 2010, The Grace Gallery did an Icons and Demigods show with over 50 peices and videos. The entire project has never had funding and has, to date, relied on thye donated time and talent of various collaborators. 
 In order to continue devloping the ongoing series further, we are hoping to garner the basic costs associated with new work. Any money raised will cover expences for sets, costumes and to pay the contributers working on the shoot. With your support, the project can continue with new images and be exhibition-ready for upcoming shows and an eventual coffee table book.

WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU'LL GET
We are hoping to raise $5000.00 to create 15 more pictures  to cover minimum expences from beginning to end. We gratefully accept all donations but with any $100.00 and up you will recieve an 8.5 by 11 signed image of your choice of existing images. For $500.00 or more you get a signed autograph and additionally, you can choose from and icon from the list below who you would like to see be re-created first. New image possibilities include:

She’s lived onWhidbey since 2004, carves fine art sculpture at the Freeland Art Studios and likes to bring people and ideas together. Her efforts to develop a central resource for the Arts on Whidbey was supported and brought to life by the
talents of her partner and spouse, Jan Shannon. Jan spent years in the Silicon
Valley working with computers before the days of laptops and certainly before
there was a glimmer of a twitter in anyone’s eye. She  developed the website
and drives all things technical for WLM. Our editor, Patricia Duff, is our fearless leader when it comes to content. Having written for the local newspaper she is well-acquainted with the arts community and involved as an artist herself in the theater and literary communities of Whidbey. She started as the only writer and blogger for WLM and now manages a team of 5 other writers, 11 bloggers, our gifted staff photographer David Welton, and Anne Belov, our Virtual Gallery curator.</span></p>

</div></div>","Art is the heart and soul of a community.  And in no place that we know of, is that more true than on Whidbey Island. It’s a place of breathtaking natural beauty, with a community that is as rich in art and culture, as it is in tall trees, open farmland, and sweeping water views. Whidbey Life Magazine is our voice.

Whidbey Life Magazine provides visitors and residents with a rich online resource for arts and cultural events. Every week we have new feature stories about our artists, local food, and performances. There is a daily calendar of events. Because of the interest in Whidbey’s visual arts, theater, and music, from around the entire region, a printed magazine would bring greater awareness of all  that our island has to offer.


In a small community, the local economy is literally our lifeblood, and arts and culture play a big part.  In the last 40 years, visual artists, writers, actors, dancers, farmers, and chefs have followed their hearts here. These creative professionals have not only contributed to the great quality of life here, they’ve also contributed to our local economy.We attract visitors from Canada, Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho and Europe, drawn by our reputation for beautiful views, comfortable weather, exciting events, local foods, numerous art schools and writing retreats. In 2012, more than $13 million was spent on art work at galleries and individual artists' studios, 25% higher than the national average. Much of this income goes right back into the local economy.
But to those of us who live here, art doesn't just exist as something to hang on a  wall. We are also rich in local farms, farmers markets, restaurants and people to whom food is also an art form.


Whidbey Life Magazine began as a way to inform all of Whidbey Island's residents and visitors about the rich cultural life available to residents and visitors. Founded by Sue Taves and Jan Shannon, WLM has been successfully publishing it's online magazine since July of 2012. In a little over one year WLM has grown and now has over 10,000 visits a month to the online magazine. We send a weekly WLM Flash email newsletter to over 1450 avid readers.Our popularity has grown, our readers and fans pushed us to a #2 spot in the King 5/Best of Western Washington contest this fall for ""Best Neighborhood Blog"" in the region over 78 other websites! 
Our readership is growing, but we believe that we can further increase it by offering a twice yearly print version of our magazine. Being in print would also give us the opportunity to reach visitors who like to ""unplug"" when they step on the ferry to our quiet island.
WHERE’S THE MONEY GOING?
We’re asking for $8250 to jump-start the print version of Whidbey Life Magazine. The print magazine will work hand in hand with the ever-changing online magazine.We Need Funds For:
Creating a template for layout and design
Printing 2500 magazines
Administrative support for the project
Advertising/Promotion/Distribution

The money we raise with this campaign will cover 30-40% of the  costs for the first year. We will raise the other funds through advertising, paid subscriptions, sponsorship and partnerships and grants. The more money we raise the more magazines we can print and distribute. If we exceed our goal, we can add more pages of content to the magazine.


Timeline:
We will spend the winter developing the template and creating the content, with a projected publication date in early spring. The first issue will focus on Spring/Summer and a second fall/winter issue, printed in September. 
If we don't meet our goal...
... we will decide between creating an inaugural 16-page (instead of 24-page) magazine or we'll postpone our launch date and take more time to raise funds from advertisers, donors and partners and work toward a first edition Summer/Fall magazine. 
The Impact
The more people there are who read about the arts when they visit Whidbey, translates to a more sustainable income for the creative community. This in turn benefits our community as a whole. 
Here's a podcast from Whidbey Air radio station, that tells about the beginnings of WLM and it's evolution from it's early days as a social media site for visual artists: Artists Sue Taves & Robbie Lobell - Isle of the Arts
Sue Taves is an artist with a passion for stone sculpting, the Whidbey community and collaboration. She’s lived onWhidbey since 2004, carves fine art sculpture at the Freeland Art Studios and likes to bring people and ideas together. Her efforts to develop a central resource for the Arts on Whidbey was supported and brought to life by the
talents of her partner and spouse, Jan Shannon. Jan spent years in the Silicon
Valley working with computers before the days of laptops and certainly before
there was a glimmer of a twitter in anyone’s eye. She  developed the website
and drives all things technical for WLM. Our editor, Patricia Duff, is our fearless leader when it comes to content. Having written for the local newspaper she is well-acquainted with the arts community and involved as an artist herself in the theater and literary communities of Whidbey. She started as the only writer and blogger for WLM and now manages a team of 5 other writers, 11 bloggers, our gifted staff photographer David Welton, and Anne Belov, our Virtual Gallery curator.
For more about us and our team see our
About Us page on WLM.
People to Whom We Are Most Grateful...
...Our readers and avid fans. Of course, our members who not only make for an

We have Sandy Rubini to thank for the evocative photo of Siri Bardarson playing the cello in an...um....rather untraditional way.

<h2><strong>Much love and dust</strong></h2>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Imagine it: a playground of extraordinary creatures in the greatest fire show. A life-size T-Rex roars across the desert playa while boxing bunnies, swimming polar bears, hopeless headless chickens, propelling pterodactyls, haunting hyenas and a 60-foot pendulum swing to the beat. All alive and burning.</strong></p>
<p>After wowing the AfrikaBurn community with the show in May this year, the AfrikaBurn Fire Collective is ready to take the show to Burning Man - and we need your help in getting it there. We are transporting our sculptures and our crew from Cape Town all the way to Black Rock City, Nevada, and it's going to be one heck of a swim, if not for <strong>YOU! </strong></p>
<p>Support us – we will shower you in love for it (or in grease, if that’s your thing!)</p>
<p><strong>About us</strong></p>
<p>The AfrikaBurn Fire Collective is a slightly feral, renegade group of blacksmiths, engineers, artists, carpenters, photographers and others from the AfrikaBurn organisation in South Africa. We like making extraordinary things and love to share our creations with the world.</p>
<p>Our mission is to take our flaming spectacular, distinctly AfrikaBurn-style, sculptural performance <strong><em>VLAM STOF (Flame &amp; Dust) Odd-I-See</em></strong> from the dusty desert in South Africa all the way to Burning Man in 2013.</p>
<p><strong> More about the show</strong></p>
<p>A blazing opera of fantastical flaming sculptures dancing under the stars, in a performance that is both magnificently playful and deeply touching.</p>
<p>The narrative is a cheeky evocation of a primordial struggle: our smithies conjure up a set of earth-creatures of steel and fire to battle it out over limited resources.  The pieces are ignited in a moving, playful chain‐reaction of fire, framed by a 60-foot high spinning pendulum blazing a beautiful arc of sparks through the night sky. Lizzy, a giant flaming T-Rex built out of scrap metal, emerges from an egg while two metal rabbits engage in a boxing match over a fallen carrot nearby. Joining in the theatrics is a flaming polar bear swimming for his life, pterodactyls, hyenas, headless chickens and more.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>We need money to share these magic creatures and their show with the world. We’ve been honoured to receive an art grant from Burning Man to help us in our quest, and we are holding fundraising events in South Africa. However as we watch our currency plummet and jet fuel prices go up, we admit our budgetary limitations, and need to appeal for more.</p>
<p>Besides the materials for the sculptures, our major cost is moving the sculptures from one side of the planet to the other – from Cape Town, South Africa to Nevada, USA.   </p>
<p> All funds go directly to AfrikaBurn Creative Projects, a not-for-profit organization. (South African reg no 2007/020812/08) – please see our website for more info on the organization and annual accounts. </p>

Much love and dust
 
 
Imagine it: a playground of extraordinary creatures in the greatest fire show. A life-size T-Rex roars across the desert playa while boxing bunnies, swimming polar bears, hopeless headless chickens, propelling pterodactyls, haunting hyenas and a 60-foot pendulum swing to the beat. All alive and burning.
After wowing the AfrikaBurn community with the show in May this year, the AfrikaBurn Fire Collective is ready to take the show to Burning Man - and we need your help in getting it there. We are transporting our sculptures and our crew from Cape Town all the way to Black Rock City, Nevada, and it's going to be one heck of a swim, if not for YOU! 
Support us – we will shower you in love for it (or in grease, if that’s your thing!)
About us
The AfrikaBurn Fire Collective is a slightly feral, renegade group of blacksmiths, engineers, artists, carpenters, photographers and others from the AfrikaBurn organisation in South Africa. We like making extraordinary things and love to share our creations with the world.
Our mission is to take our flaming spectacular, distinctly AfrikaBurn-style, sculptural performance VLAM STOF (Flame & Dust) Odd-I-See from the dusty desert in South Africa all the way to Burning Man in 2013.
 More about the show
A blazing opera of fantastical flaming sculptures dancing under the stars, in a performance that is both magnificently playful and deeply touching.
The narrative is a cheeky evocation of a primordial struggle: our smithies conjure up a set of earth-creatures of steel and fire to battle it out over limited resources.  The pieces are ignited in a moving, playful chain‐reaction of fire, framed by a 60-foot high spinning pendulum blazing a beautiful arc of sparks through the night sky. Lizzy, a giant flaming T-Rex built out of scrap metal, emerges from an egg while two metal rabbits engage in a boxing match over a fallen carrot nearby. Joining in the theatrics is a flaming polar bear swimming for his life, pterodactyls, hyenas, headless chickens and more.
What We Need
We need money to share these magic creatures and their show with the world. We’ve been honoured to receive an art grant from Burning Man to help us in our quest, and we are holding fundraising events in South Africa. However as we watch our currency plummet and jet fuel prices go up, we admit our budgetary limitations, and need to appeal for more.
Besides the materials for the sculptures, our major cost is moving the sculptures from one side of the planet to the other – from Cape Town, South Africa to Nevada, USA.   
 All funds go directly to AfrikaBurn Creative Projects, a not-for-profit organization. (South African reg no 2007/020812/08) – please see our website for more info on the organization and annual accounts.

<p><strong>WHO WE ARE:</strong></p>
<p>The <a href=""http://www.f3bscholars.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>F3B team</strong></a> believes that there are three things that can significantly improve a young person’s life.</p>
<ul>
<li><em> <strong>The opportunity to travel abroad.</strong></em></li>
<li><strong><em> Defining a discipline.</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em> Gaining confidence in their communication skills.</em></strong></li>
</ul><p>So when we created our non-profit, F3B, almost 14 years ago, we kept those three factors at the forefront of our minds. For the last several years, we’ve cultivated a unique scholar athlete program — taking a small selection of the brightest female basketball players from high schools across the North East and giving them to opportunity to travel throughout Africa. Once there, they work, learn and practice their skills with young women in each country.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/748448/pictures/full/20130409161427-f3bball.jpg?1365549270"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>And our adventures have been a blast. Through F3B, the young women – <a href=""http://www.f3bscholars.org/artist-profile-chanel-johnson/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong><em>many of them experiencing traveling abroad for the very first time</em></strong></a> – have traveled to more than 20 countries throughout Africa; including Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa, Ethiopia, Morocco, Liberia, Rwanda, Kenya, Botswana and Tanzania. In 2011, we even traveled to Romania and Bulgaria. In the last 14 years, we've met presidents, volunteered at orphanages and have organized more than 560 hours of basketball instruction combined for the African and American teens.</p>
<p>This summer the F3B team is traveling to <strong>Malawi, Tanzania and Zanzibar</strong>, but we need your help.</p>
<p><strong>HOW CAN YOU HELP?:</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>So, you want to know how you can help make this experience even better for our teen girls?</em></strong></p>
<p>This summer, the F3B team is scheduled to travel to Malawi, Tanzania and Zanzibar. From August 1<sup>st</sup>- August 17<sup>th</sup>, the teens will participate in a series of basketball and leadership development camps, while also exploring the culture and local people — including a visit to the U.S. embassy in Malawi, meeting with Joyce Banda, Malawi’s president, visiting several local orphanages in Tanzania and traveling by boat to Zanzibar. </p>
<p>But we must raise more money for this year’s trip. Roughly <em><strong>$15,000.00</strong></em> more.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-family: Book Antiqua; color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>The money will be used to subsidize this year's program for the 26 participating girls (six from America and 20 from Africa). Along with significantly subsidizing the program, it will also fund our visit to an orphanage where we will be donating clothing, books, crayons and toys.</strong> </span></li>

<p>Through the years, we have had the opportunity to meet some of Africa’s top artists, who have continuously given their full support to our mission. We have also worked with emerging photographers, who have skillfully captured beautiful photographs of our programs abroad.</p>
<p>As part of our donation incentives, these artists have agreed to participate in our fundraiser by donating some of their best pieces at a fraction of their market value. We even have a special collaboration with artist, Frank Morrison, who has designed 30 limited edition F3B totes just for this campaign.</p>

We collaborate with organizations and community members using Art as therapy, to beautify space, build community, and as an educational tool that reflects the people’s culture and life stories. Our GoalsOur goals are to provide workshops and paint a mural in solidarity with community members at each refugee camp we visit in Palestine. In addition, we will work to bridge previous experiences working with diverse cultures in order to identify our common struggles and work to overcome those inequalities through art. The ImpactThe M.U.R.A.L. Project is honored to team up with Fellowship of Reconciliation Delegation of Artists from the U.S. and Asia to work with victims of war in Palestine and collaborate on multimedia projects for social change.  Working with Fellowship of Reconciliation will be a humbling experience that will allow us to learn from other non-violent movements for peace and justice that are happening in Palestine. By applying our newfound knowledge to future projects, these experiences will serve to enrich our continued work with disenfranchised communities. Your SupportSince we are embarking on this journey without corporate sponsors or grants, we are asking for your financial support to fund this life-changing project and to continue our tireless work with war-torn communities in the Middle East. Your support will cover Airfare, Food and Lodging for Three Weeks.Other ways you can help

</div><p><b><a href=""www.berlinunlimited.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Berlin Unlimited</a> is a project in and about Berlin based on the participation of the public: via an international open call we have invited submissions of work in a variety of media, coming from different disciplines, in order to create an interdisciplinary narrative of this (un)limited city. Exhibited in ZKU in October 2014, the jury-reviewed selection of the submissions, forms the basis of a programme of events bringing together artists, researchers, theorists, architects, urbanists, students and professionals, experts and the public. Our goal: an open multi-platform exchange of visions, ideas, and proposals about the city’s different realities, challenges and opportunities.</b></p>
<p>Berlin Unlimited: an exhibition, a talk series, a workshop, and parallel events, taking place in Berlin in October 2014.</p>
<p>Only twenty five years after the fall of the Berlin wall and the end of the “concrete division” (Willy Brandt, 10.09.1989), the city of Berlin is still in the process of re-definition and growth - a complex urban and political process, between the renewal of its own image as the “creative capital” and the establishing corporatism.</p>
<p>The exhibition “Berlin Unlimited” is aiming to explore the contradiction of urban realities - between matters of individual freedom and urban constraint. By means of art and creative media, architecture and urban design, theory and research, “Berlin Unlimited” aims to reveal an interdisciplinary narrative about the city and to display a critical view on its former limits, today’s limitations and tomorrow’s possible new divisions.</p>
<p>The exhibition will be accompanied by a series of public events: Discussions among invited professionals, artists, participants, and the public, will open up a broader dialogue around the opportunities and the challenges Berlin is currently facing. An unlimited programme of events such as film screenings, guided tours, intensive workshops, talks, creative caterings and unlimited parties will take place in ZK/U and around the city. </p>
<p><b><i>Our aims, why we need your support and how we plan to use it:</i></b><i> </i></p>
<p>The project is made possible thanks to the voluntary work of an international network of collaborators passionate to:</p>
<p>1. Advance the work of artists, researchers, theorists, architects, urban design and planning professionals.</p>
<p>2. Promote an understanding of the city through the synergy of a multitude of disciplines and media.</p>
<p>3. Create new knowledge on the local particularities of the city of Berlin through a global spectrum of projects.</p>
<p>4. Promote public interest and debate about the city of Berlin and its urban development.</p>
<p>In the longer term, the project aims to:</p>
<p>1. Foster lasting collaborations and strong links among the exhibition’s participants, project partners and collaborators.</p>
<p>2. Contribute to the greater public agenda and debate on issues facing the contemporary city.</p>
<p>The whole team has been working hard and freely - without any limits! - to shape the ideal event program.</p>
<p><b>For you, </b>we already gathered a team of highly qualified professionals willing to share their expertise and passion for Berlin with the public. The first stage of Berlin Unlimited has been launched in March 2014, through an open international call for ideas. </p>
<p>The installation proposed through Berlin Unlimited in the space of the ZK/U is the opportunity of experimenting in a human scale a new kind of spatial disposals in order to create a political agora driving by cultural purposes.</p>
<p>We have the network, we have the experience, we have the perfect place… but to make it happen and to make it good, we need your support!</p>

<p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: justify;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px;"">In terms of our public presence, we operate as a promotional and networking platform specifically designed to support emerging artists by promoting events that can help further their careers and aspirations. Through our regular networking meetings and seminars, every visual artist will have the right to voice their opinion and share their work in a friendly environment and will also have the opportunity to apply for our exhibitions, organised and curated by a team of professionals from the London art scene. Its purpose is simple, we hope to build a bridge between established artists represented by agents and galleries, and emerging artists by providing them with an alternative channel to show their work. Promotion through LoVArts will expose these artists to public feedback on a scale that they would otherwise not have access to.</span></p>

In essence, we discover ‘unknown artists’ and present them to the world in a format that will be recognisable to buyers, collectors and the wider art-savvy public. We firmly believe that the events that artists need are those which provide a channel to obtain commissions and sales.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p>More info: <a href=""www.lovarts.co.uk%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.lovarts.co.uk </a></p><h3><br/></h3><p><b>WHAT WE NEED </b></p><p></p><p></p><p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: justify;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px;"">Our primary goal has been to raise 160 000 GBP.

Be Discovered.</p><h3><br/></h3><p></p></div>","'INFINITE LONDON' 'Infinite London' will be a fine art exhibition for emerging visual artists, who are based in London and create their art in London. It is planned to be an art event of the year! “London goes beyond any boundary or convention. It contains every wish or word ever spoken, every action or gesture ever made, every harsh or noble statement ever expressed. It is illimitable. It is infinite London.” Peter Ackroyd‘Infinite London’ is inspired by London as a living, breathing, laughing, screaming entity in its own right, as perfectly captured by Peter Ackroyd in his book ‘London: The Biography’. We intend to match the animated nature of London with refined but vibrant entries from all of our selected artists. This does by no means only include pieces that depict our surroundings in a literal way. The works have to be made in London


DETAILS OF THE PROJECT:• Location:  The Vaults - Iconic Tunnels under Waterloo Underground Station, 5 minutes walk from Westminster (http://www.the-vaults.org)

•  Date:

15 - 19 October 2014 (during Frieze Art Fair, when the world’s art collectors and enthusiasts will be in London)

The exhibition will kick-off with an invitation-only opening night on 15 October, where guests will include partners, art collectors, politicians, journalists and bloggers. This will be followed by a public opening of four days for the general public and art enthusiasts  from 16 to 19 October.

•  Target Audience:  

LoVArts aims to attract 5,000 visitors to the exhibition, including Londoners, Art Collectors, Galleries, Curators, Journalists, Art Enthusiasts. Crucially, LoVArts will provide an event that is more accessible to also non-elite art enthusiasts than the Frieze Art Fair, by pricing tickets at £5 each (with concessions) in a non-traditional venue near one of London’s public transport hubs.

•  Mission:

The key mission of ‘Infinite London’ is to reveal talented, but still unknown artists who live and work in London, as well as to promote London as the world’s artistic hub.  All artworks must have been made in London by artists based in this city. • Accessible
Minimum costs for artists to submit and exhibit their artworks.•  High Level of Artworks:

Artworks will be selected by a team of professional curators with cumulative experience across some of London’s most prestigious institutes, including:
- V&A
- British Museum
- Science Museum 
- Royal Academy of Arts.

We expect 1,000 submissions from which curators will choose the best 50 artists.•  About the team:We have a great team working every day to make sure this exhibition will be successful.The other part of the team with additional 20+ people, includes (with sample clients):
Curators: Amelie von Harrach & Arturo Galansino (V&A, Royal Academy of Arts, National Gallery, Science Museum, British Museum)
Designer: Nova Collective (London Olympic Games, BBC, Disney Media, Ferrari, Shell)
Light Designer: Jonny Milmer Light Design (Land Rover, Canon, Battersea Power Station, Ford, BT Tower)
Video Producers: Stoke&Dagger (Barclays, Red Bull, Yahoo, Virgin Atlantic, National Geographic) 
Marketing & PR: TBurnsArts (Poetry Society, Blain Southern, Possitive View Foundation)

as well as art consultants, financial consultants, architects, marketing specialists, blog contributors and fundraising manager.
LONDON AS A HUMAN BODY:Brief of 'Infinite London' for the Artists:London is like a human body and I am one of its organs. We can’t live without each other, we can’t live separately. Humans are like little blood cells traveling through the artificial veins and arteries that are the streets and underground tunnels keeping the city alive and growing. I want to express my feelings and emotions towards this relationship through artwork. I act as the pulse of creativity that keeps the culture system flowing. I need to emphasise my importance in our coexistence.As artists living in London, we are all in one way or another influenced by the city. It shapes our behaviour, our way of thinking, our everyday existence. It thus has an impact on the works of art we produce, whether the imagery and content are directly related to it or not. We are a part of London, and London is intrinsically connected to ourselves and our creative output.
There will be a selection of the best artworks depicting the emotions and inner feelings inspired by being part of London. LoVArts will encourage artists to ‘bare all’ in their artistic entries; we want refined but vibrant entries to be representative of the artists’ particular London experience, and how they wish to ‘give back’ creatively to the city’s atmosphere and life. 
A professional panel of curators (with cumulative experience across some of London’s most prestigious institutes, including V&A, the British Museum, the Science Museum and the Royal Academy of Arts) will choose the best artworks. 
FUTURE OF 'INFINITE LONDON''Infinite London' is planed to be the annual art event that takes place in London every October. We are also aiming at presenting the show abroad, including Dubai and New York. Each time the exhibition will be different, however, it will always expose artworks of the London based artists only. You can help us to make 'Infinite London' an event of the year!ABOUT LOVARTS LoVArts - London Visual Arts is a non-profit organisation that functions as a promotional and networking platform for emerging visual artists based in London. 
We want to impact positively on the careers and aspirations of emerging artists through: regular networking meetings, seminars and promotional events curated by professionals. 
In terms of our public presence, we operate as a promotional and networking platform specifically designed to support emerging artists by promoting events that can help further their careers and aspirations. Through our regular networking meetings and seminars, every visual artist will have the right to voice their opinion and share their work in a friendly environment and will also have the opportunity to apply for our exhibitions, organised and curated by a team of professionals from the London art scene. Its purpose is simple, we hope to build a bridge between established artists represented by agents and galleries, and emerging artists by providing them with an alternative channel to show their work. Promotion through LoVArts will expose these artists to public feedback on a scale that they would otherwise not have access to.
The platform not only achieves exposure for the artists on the highest possible professional level but also serves as an introductory network so that reaching their target audience is facilitated. In essence, we discover ‘unknown artists’ and present them to the world in a format that will be recognisable to buyers, collectors and the wider art-savvy public. We firmly believe that the events that artists need are those which provide a channel to obtain commissions and sales.More info: www.lovarts.co.uk WHAT WE NEED Our primary goal has been to raise 160 000 GBP.

kit for ten artists that are participating in the program.  


Included in each kit will be:
·  Easel (portable) $125
·  Set of paints $175
·  Brushes $50
·  Canvas/Paper $100
·  Cleaning and other
supplies $50
Total $500 / per kit
If more than $5000 is raised, we will
add a participant for each additional $500
contributed.  Ideally though, We’d like to keep the program fairly small,
in order to provide individualized attention for each artist.

What
You Get / Perks
The Matisse Perk:
For a $10 contribution, you
will receive a postcard of one of the artist's works, with a warm thank
you.  
The Picasso Perk:
For a $25 contribution, you
will receive a set of three A4 sized prints from the artists
participating in the program. 
The Basquiat Perk:
For a $100 contribution, you will receive a small original painting from one of the artists participating in the program.
The Monet Perk:
For a $250 contribution, you
will receive an original painting from one of the artists participating in the
program.
All contributors will also
get listed on our Twitter and Facebook pages.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

I currently work at Image Comics Inc. as a production artist doing book design and layout, but when I am not at my day job I am hard at work delving into the world of freelance genre illustration.</p>
<p>In the most recent months I have been gearing up for some larger personal projects that I am planning, along with a larger book with my good friend Andrew Miscisco. A large part of preparing for these projects has been all the preliminary work that occurs throughout my various sketchbooks. The goal of ""Delve"" is to compile all of my recent sketchbook work into one place to share with the world. Something that I can hand to someone and say ""this is what I spend most my days doing"".</p>
<p>The book itself will be a full color 40 page perfect bound softcover printed on #60 natural paper with a matte cover finish. Each page will be an artistically composed collection of all the various stages and directions of the creative process and will not only give you a window into my artistic process, but into the worlds that take shape throughout.</p>

Let's keep the momentum going all the way to $125,000. BEFORE SHOT AFTER - GRANVILLE ISLAND SIDEAFTER - WATER SIDE CELEBRATING GREAT PUBLIC ARTWe took the saying, “Go Big or Go Home” literally when we chose this project. Imagine a 360-degree, 70-foot (21 metre) tall outdoor mural that’s over 23,500 square feet (7,162 metres) in size. And it’s not just any mural.This one is designed and created by OSGEMEOS, two uber-exciting Brazilian artists who happen to be identical twin brothers. OSGEMEOS, which literally means “the twins”, have taken the Contemporary art world by storm. This is their biggest project to date and their first in Canada. The mural will be painted on the six gigantic industrial Ocean Concrete silos on Vancouver’s Granville Island. The location attracts 10.5 million visitors a year from around the globe, so the mural is destined to become one of the most recognizable and iconic works of public art anywhere in the world.

the silos at no charge and have given us considerable time, energy and
expertise needed to turn an industrial site into a work of art.


The Vancouver Biennale is covering
all curatorial costs, project management costs, promotional costs and
administration costs throughout the 2-year process from curatorial vision
through to the realization of the complete mural. The Biennale has also
negotiated gifts-in-kind and deep discounts on most of the materials and labour
required.

Hard costs for the project are:
             ·  Airfare (OSGEMEOS + 4 team members): $16,000             ·

painter, sculptor and community muralist living in Lawrence, Kansas.  I am currently working on a mural project with
the kids at New York Elementary School in my neighborhood, which allows me to
combine my three loves: <b>East Lawrence, kids &amp; murals</b>!  </p>
<p>The East Lawrence neighborhood is
where I have hung my hat now for 38 years, and my home is where I create my
artwork<span>.  In
the last ten years I have worked on ten large community murals located here in
Lawrence, Kansas and on the Great Mural Wall in Topeka, Kansas.  </span></p>
<p><b>Why a mural project</b>, you might ask?  The usual picture of a solo artist working
alone in her studio, in contrast to outdoor mural painting, are very different
art methods. I want the kids to experience that contrast first-hand.  Painting outdoors stimulates all of the
senses:  hearing the birds sing around
you, feeling the warmth of the sun, seeing neighborhood people walking by.
Sometimes passerby’s will even stop and give feedback, and that direct feedback
I think the kids will enjoy. The mural images also tell a story to the whole
community about what has happened in this area since 1869 when the school was
first founded. And public outdoor murals bring joy and color that lightens the
mood and makes people smile that wander by. 
</p>
<p><b>Our mural team</b> consists of two
4th grade classes and two 5th-grade classes led by their two art teachers, Mitch Pearson &amp; Jacob Lewis, School Principal Nancy DeGarmo, and me.  In the past year, this mural project has
already been fully integrated into their art class projects, with a walking
tour of their neighborhood, historic research, drawings, and mural design prep
work.  It has given them a sense of neighborhood belonging &amp; ownership, and shown them they are an integral part of telling its
story, even as it continues to unfold.  This Fall the final step of the project is when the kids actually paint the mural on a building that long-time neighborhood supporters John &amp; Arch Naramore own across the street from the school.</p>
<p>Our mural project is almost <b>halfway
funded</b> already from outside sources, and we have turned to Indiegogo to help
with this fund-raising.  An Indiegogo
contribution from you would help keep this project going!  Your Indiegogo contribution will give the
kids a one of a kind experience they couldn’t get anywhere else: community
building, working on a big project team, and creating awesome public art!  Please help us get the word out and share our
campaign with your friends!</p>
<p><b>Budget</b>: Grand Total of Mural project
is around $8,000. So far we have received a $2500 grant from the Lawrence
Schools Foundation and $400 from the Van Go / Color Run fund-raiser in October
2014, so we are almost half-way there. We are looking to raise the remainder of
the funds from people like you through Indiegogo! If we surpass our
fund-raising goal for this mural, NYE School Principal Nancy DeGarmo and I are already having discussions to
add a large indoor mural for the school next year. So any extra funds will roll-over
to the next mural. 

</p><p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b>: My past
mural experience has taught me that poor weather will come and keep us from
painting outdoors, and some kids will lose interest in the mural. That's why we
have built in extra time and are working hard to keep all of the kids engaged
in their art classes with the design process over the last year. Our
neighborhood is under pressure from developers, so the building could
potentially be purchased and torn down in the future. We are painting on cement
board and attaching it to the outdoor wall, so that the mural can be moved if
the building gets sold and demolished in the future.</p>

<p>FCG hopes to raise $1000 over the next two months to cover costs associated with much needed façade improvements to the gallery. Specifically, FCG hopes to use raised funds
towards costs associated with a new street-level sign. Our current sign, now in
a state of decay, only reads “FCG”. Using only our abbreviated name hinders new
comers from coming into the gallery- we need our full name on our sign! This
obstacle makes it difficult for us to fulfill our goal of creating a friendly,
inclusive environment and welcoming new patrons into the gallery. The (new)
sign, proudly displaying our full name, Forest City Gallery, will also display
the font chosen by founder member Robert Fones in 1973 for FCG- 41 years of
tradition! The cross-section, FCG's logo, also designed by Robert Fones, will also be proudly displayed on our window signage and A-frame.</p><p>This sign would be durable, as well as transportable in the chance that FCG may relocate in upcoming years. </p>
<p>All
of the money donated will be going towards rebuilding and improving FCG’s
façade. No funny business - FCG really needs a new sign. </p>

About FCG:
Forest
City Gallery (FCG) is an
artist-run centre that has been operating in London, Ontario for 41 years. FCG
is a registered charity and is currently London’s only Artist-Run Centre. 
We are devoted to exhibiting and promoting contemporary fine art, as well as
dedicated to paying artists according the national payment standard (CARFAC).
FCG actively pays approximately $20,000.00 per year to local artists for their
exhibitions, artist talks, workshops, and projects. Every year FCG directly
supports over 50 emerging artists across Canada, mainly in London,
Ontario.  FCG also supports local musicians by paying approximately $3000
per year to bands for their performances at monthly music events. FCG
hosts and co-hosts up to 40 events per year, reaching over 20,000 Londoners
with the hopes of further strengthening our vibrant, growing arts community.

Goal:
FCG hopes to raise $1000 over the next two months to cover costs associated with much needed façade improvements to the gallery. Specifically, FCG hopes to use raised funds

</h3>
<p>My name is Miriam Gabriel, known lately as Miri. I am a transdisciplinary scholar and spoken-word artist. I hold a masters in Consciousness Studies from Goddard College, and there is little I enjoy more than frequenting visits to coffee shops and college diversity centers to perform and behold performers. Most of my work and life are inspired by the way the sounds we make can transform lives and worlds. The sign, the sigh, the silence, the chanting, the speaking to one another. Transforming self, what is experienced as self, sense of body and soul, sense of community, country, and cosmic interconnectedness. I write, more than anything, but also sing, read aloud, scream, and even uncomfortably stare to notice how fully you and I and all else are here.<br/><br/>I recently received one strong stare back, and a nod of mutual recognition, with nothing awkward and everything affirming, by the phenomenal nation-wide Network for the Trnasformative Language Arts! Very recently, I have been approached by network founder and former instructor, the poet laureate of Kansas Caryn Mirriam-Goldberg, to be an official board member and Worlds of Change blog curator for the Network. I could not describe to you how I felt: happy, very happy, and... durable. Confident in what I do and in being counted on to do more.<br/><br/><b>What is the Transformative Language Arts Network?</b><br/><br/>The Transformative Language Arts as a new discipline brings out this sense of mutual responsiveness and collaboration from writers and artists. In a nutshell, TLA is defined on the Network's official website as ""the intentional use of spoken, written, or sung word for social and personal transformation. This includes community building, ecological advocacy, social activism, personal growth and development, health and healing, and spiritual growth."" It is writing, singing, speaking or listening as a way of knowing: it is a mode of discovery and creativity that casts the spells of change work in the interconnected arenas of human life on and with this planet. I want to start with my neighborhood, as well as all the neighborhoods that the TLAN can connect with nationally and abroad. <br/></p></span></span></span><h3>The Power of Words Conference and My Role In It<br/>
</h3>
<span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><p>My joining of the Network came too close to their Power of Words Conference, happening in Philadelphia between October 11th and 13th, to which I have a full scholarship to attend other than the cost of my flight and possibly some (but not all!) lodging and transportation costs. At the conference, I will have a chance to directly participate in workshops on writing as a healing and culture re-building practice with nationally-renowned poets, artists and singers: such as Taina Asili, Dick Allen, Michelle Myers and Deb Hensley.<br/><br/>At the conference, I will I be able to jump-start my blogging role for the TLAN official blog, Worlds of Change, by covering the conference live so as to make available for free the information, tips, and experiences gained from working with the aforementioned mentors. In addition, I may even have a chance to offer a small workshop of my own! As it will be my first workshop at a major conference, I plan to share a series of writing exercises that would help create gritty, genuine and bridging dialogue between two or more seemingly rifting parts of a writer's influences or culture(s). I will use examples from my continual bridging of spiritual practice, feminist activism, Egyptian and American cultures, working-class economic awareness, and academic scholarship.

</h3><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><p>For this campaign, I chose the minimum amount of $500.00, out of which an average of $350.00 will be just enough to cover the cost of my round-trip flight from Orlando to Philadelphia and back. In addition, I would like to contribute to modifying the layout of the TLAN blog website so as to make it more user-friendly, colorful, multimedia-oriented and welcoming! According to Wordpress rates, that would average to about $75.00 for a well-designed, user-friendly layout.<br/><br/><b>Remaining Contributions Will Go Here</b></p>
<p>Any remaining financial support will be used towards a multitude of projects I have been saving up for - rhizome-like, participatory community projects that I have been planning to bring together in Orlando and now cover live for the Worlds of Change blog as examples of TLA work. Here are some examples:<br/><br/>- a scheduled project with the Gallery at Avalon Park in Downtown, Orlando specifically their Corridor Project, which adapts the concept of a stationary ""gallery"" to the moving streets, peoples and events of our city, such that everything from store fronts to moving buses become a site for artistic, locally connected performance. I am collaborating with phenomenal film maker and make-up artist Kelly Zak on my installation, a live poetry performance during which I will change clothes to represent variegated local cultures and engage passer-by reactions. I will use any additional funds toward compensating Kelly in any way I can for her generous collaboration with me and for using her equipment and make-up.<br/><br/>- a series of poetry-music collaborative tracks where we address the local conditions of culture creatives in Florida who tend to work hospitality-industry, low-paying jobs to be able to establish themselves as artists, educators, community organizers, holistic healers, and other self-starting careers that bring life to Orlando. I am collaborating here with best friend and bandmate, the phenomenal musician Benny Vazquez, a.k.a. Insert. So far, Benny has top-notch musical equipment and musical instruments, except for a decent mic. For his continual generosity in sharing his infinitely rich and socially-connected talent and tools, I want to contribute the mic to his studio.<br/><br/>- launching The Compendium with Benny, the multitalented local painter, writer and improv performer Curtis Walker and the renowned scholar and blogger Jeremy Johnson, where we will leave flash-drive collections of our work at sporadic spots in Orlando that would cover local and global topics such as the imagination, consciousness, race, spirituality, and artistic freedom. Copying into print an Orlando/Cairo zine and distributing it in both cities, bilingually written by young artists with a focus on intersections of spiritual/religious practice and queer activism. Also starting and encouraging a reading-booth project all over Orlando, setting up cardboard booths where passer-bys can choose a from a variety of books from which I will read aloud – for a penny, a smile, or a hug.<br/></p>

My name is Miriam Gabriel, known lately as Miri. I am a transdisciplinary scholar and spoken-word artist. I hold a masters in Consciousness Studies from Goddard College, and there is little I enjoy more than frequenting visits to coffee shops and college diversity centers to perform and behold performers. Most of my work and life are inspired by the way the sounds we make can transform lives and worlds. The sign, the sigh, the silence, the chanting, the speaking to one another. Transforming self, what is experienced as self, sense of body and soul, sense of community, country, and cosmic interconnectedness. I write, more than anything, but also sing, read aloud, scream, and even uncomfortably stare to notice how fully you and I and all else are here.I recently received one strong stare back, and a nod of mutual recognition, with nothing awkward and everything affirming, by the phenomenal nation-wide Network for the Trnasformative Language Arts! Very recently, I have been approached by network founder and former instructor, the poet laureate of Kansas Caryn Mirriam-Goldberg, to be an official board member and Worlds of Change blog curator for the Network. I could not describe to you how I felt: happy, very happy, and... durable. Confident in what I do and in being counted on to do more.What is the Transformative Language Arts Network?The Transformative Language Arts as a new discipline brings out this sense of mutual responsiveness and collaboration from writers and artists. In a nutshell, TLA is defined on the Network's official website as ""the intentional use of spoken, written, or sung word for social and personal transformation. This includes community building, ecological advocacy, social activism, personal growth and development, health and healing, and spiritual growth."" It is writing, singing, speaking or listening as a way of knowing: it is a mode of discovery and creativity that casts the spells of change work in the interconnected arenas of human life on and with this planet. I want to start with my neighborhood, as well as all the neighborhoods that the TLAN can connect with nationally and abroad. The Power of Words Conference and My Role In It

My joining of the Network came too close to their Power of Words Conference, happening in Philadelphia between October 11th and 13th, to which I have a full scholarship to attend other than the cost of my flight and possibly some (but not all!) lodging and transportation costs. At the conference, I will have a chance to directly participate in workshops on writing as a healing and culture re-building practice with nationally-renowned poets, artists and singers: such as Taina Asili, Dick Allen, Michelle Myers and Deb Hensley.At the conference, I will I be able to jump-start my blogging role for the TLAN official blog, Worlds of Change, by covering the conference live so as to make available for free the information, tips, and experiences gained from working with the aforementioned mentors. In addition, I may even have a chance to offer a small workshop of my own! As it will be my first workshop at a major conference, I plan to share a series of writing exercises that would help create gritty, genuine and bridging dialogue between two or more seemingly rifting parts of a writer's influences or culture(s). I will use examples from my continual bridging of spiritual practice, feminist activism, Egyptian and American cultures, working-class economic awareness, and academic scholarship. This intuitive, stretching process can be challenging as it is rewarding, producing what I believe to be the most connected and important rebuilding work for communities in our time. This is exactly the work I wish to contribute to my world with my every fiber - to Orlando, to Cairo, to readers, artists, and everyday people crossing paths in cyber space. But I am starting with a waitress' salary, for now, and am underprepared financially for the pleasant surprise of the scholarship.The Gift Exchange
For this campaign, I chose the minimum amount of $500.00, out of which an average of $350.00 will be just enough to cover the cost of my round-trip flight from Orlando to Philadelphia and back.

<h3>Hello, we made a magazine.</h3>
<p>Our names are Lauren Dulay and Nicole Hennessy. We've been coming up with ridiculous ideas together for about 12 years. This is the best one we've had.</p>
<p>Nicole is a journalist living in Lakewood, Ohio. She writes for a small weekly paper called West Life and otherwise begs for freelance work. She also dabbles in poetry, teaching workshops at Ohio City Writers, and is really good at calling people over and over and over again (a skilled trait acquired through journalism that somewhat resembles stalking). Lauren is a tattoo artist with a natural talent for art. When she's not tattooing or becoming consumed with all things Miser, she can be found doing many of her other hobbies, like animated cartoons, experimenting with music, making dollhouse miniatures, or just plain procrastinating.</p>
<h3>Miser Magazine</h3>
<p>Bi-monthly, it's based on local authors, artists, and creators from the Cleveland and NEO area with our own creative touches in peculiar ways. We distribute it in fun places in Lakewood, Coventry, Gordon Square, Ohio City, Tremont, downtown and Waterloo. Once we have enough gas money to go farther than that, we will.</p>
</div>
<div>We made it entirely ourselves - brainstormed, collected, organized, printed in a garage, assembled, stapled, and distibuted them.</div>
<div>
<h3>Give us money  :(</h3>
</div>
<div>We need all the dollars we can get, in order to keep this free to our readers. We started with 300 copies, but we realized people really like it and that we need to atleast double the amount to 600. Which means we can't pay for all of that. 300 was cutting it close.</div>
<div>We feel it is important to keep art free. This magazine is not only a place for art to be expressed and enjoyed freely, but it helps local businesses that advertise in our magazine and helps unite our community to inspire to create. Just pick one up and see for yourself!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you think our idea is really sweet, and you want to help and you can't even spare a dollar, you can atleast help spread the word and try to tell your wealthier friends about us, about our mission, and especially about this super handy donations website.</div>

<p>Fine artist Tommy Roberts was invited to share his talents abroad with Artists 2 Africa, participating as a teacher on this tour representing his discipline of painting. He is one of several artists throughout the U.S. invited to teach other creative mediums including: <strong>Carren Clarke-Mcadoo (VA), Shurvon Haynes(WA), Jolyn E. Gardner (WA), Karen Y. Buster (MD), Larry Poncho Brown (MD), and Ethan Holland (PA),</strong> to name a few. A noteworthy group of American artists exchanging creative education with African artists!</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT A2A:</strong></p>
<p><strong>ARTISTS 2 AFRICA</strong> was birthed from decades of artists discussing the prospect of organizing a group journey to Africa tailored specifically for artists and focused on art education. <strong>On October 19-30, 2013 we will embark on our second official journey to Ghana West Africa!</strong></p>
<p>The artists will journey into the art villages on the outskirts of Ghana. Various artisans including painters, sculptors, and weavers will be gathered in their workshops to create and collaborate. We will fellowship with the artists and students, visit their workshops to share technique, and explore the creative process, while exchanging our creative ideas with the artisans in the region. An exhibition will be organized featuring the works of each artist. <strong>Our focus is to educate and connect through ART.</strong></p>
<p><strong>HOW WILL YOUR FUNDS BE UTILIZED?</strong></p>
<p>With your support we hope you will assist us with this unified effort. As you can see on the right...the artist has graciously donated his art for pledge rewards. The campaign is to assist us with acquiring art materials for other artists to use on our visit as we fellowship by creating art. We will be visiting 4 locations where ceramic, wood carving, fabric making and other artforms are taught and produced. We will introduce various art projects and will instruct several groups of artisans and other participants. Funds will assist with art supplies and materials, and small tools. We also plan to document this experience with photography and video as a future educational medium. We hope you will take advantage of this unique opportunity to assist with this project....thank you. <strong>Share.Teach.Create!</strong></p></div>","ABOUT THE ARTIST:

We will fellowship with the artists and students, visit their workshops to share technique, and explore the creative process, while exchanging our creative ideas with the artisans in the region. An exhibition will be organized featuring the works of each artist. Our focus is to educate and connect through ART.
HOW WILL YOUR FUNDS BE UTILIZED?
With your support we hope you will assist us with this unified effort. As you can see on the right...the artist has graciously donated his art for pledge rewards. The campaign is to assist us with acquiring art materials for other artists to use on our visit as we fellowship by creating art. We will be visiting 4 locations where ceramic, wood carving, fabric making and other artforms are taught and produced. We will introduce various art projects and will instruct several groups of artisans and other participants. Funds will assist with art supplies and materials, and small tools. We also plan to document this experience with photography and video as a future educational medium. We hope you will take advantage of this unique opportunity to assist with this project....thank you. Share.Teach.Create!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Thank you for checking out my campaign! My intention with this project is to harness the transformative power of art to inspire hope and compassion in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside, an area known for its high rates of poverty and drug use. </p>
<p>I hope to achieve this by turning one of my drawings into a 45"" by 66"" bus shelter advertisement, which will be placed near Pigeon Park at Hastings and Carrall streets for a period of one month. If money is raised beyond the intended goal, it will be used to extend the duration of the ad (the cost for advertising alone is $2,160 for 28 days). I will also be printing posters and postcards to put up and leave around the city.</p>
<p>The artwork in question is a colourful and energetic piece with the affirmation “Believe in Yourself” embedded amongst its visual elements (you can find the full image in the Gallery). The advertising space will not be used to credit myself as an artist, nor any other individual, organization, or institution – it is intended purely as an offering of hope and inspiration, while also functioning as an interesting social experiment that explores how ‘advertising’ might be used in more positive and constructive ways.</p>
<p>I have been fascinated with the idea of ‘positive advertising’ for some time now, as I believe it carries tremendous power and potential, but doesn’t really have a place in our consumer-based society. I’m intrigued by the idea of subverting the typical applications of advertising in such a way that they help to encourage internal reflection, rather than simply compel people to buy a product. Many of the struggles we face start within ourselves, and so it is within where true change must begin.</p>
<p>So, for as much as this project is directed at those who live in the Downtown Eastside, it truly stands to benefit everyone – myself included. After all, we could all be reminded from time to time to believe in ourselves. This is my little way (and possibly yours!) to give back to the greater community we all share.</p>
<p>When we help other people, we ultimately help ourselves.  By learning to love other people, regardless of any superficiality we might assign to them (like race or class), we can create the positive change in the world that we all wish to see, yet might have forgotten is possible.</p>
<p>Believe in the potential we all possess, and the power we hold to create a more loving, inclusive, and compassionate world for all.  We’re all in this together! </p>

<h3>My Name is Tracey Clay.</h3>
<p>I am graduating from the University of Northern Colorado this summer with a Bachelors in Anthropology and a Bachelors in Photo Imaging. My dream in life is to mix my two passions of photography and cultural studies into a career of travel and documentary photography. I believe that it is with this medium that change can happen in the world.</p>
<p>Now that you know a little bit about my background and my life dreams, you will understand why, when I learned of this trip, I just had to be a part of it!</p>
<h3>The Giving Lens</h3>
<p>The trip to Tanzania is with an organization called The Giving Lens. Founded by Colby Brown, a professional landscape, travel and humanitarian photographer and world-renouned photo-educator, TGL combines photography with humanitarian work around the world. By offering their cameras and their time, TGL teams help various non-profit organizations in any way needed. In addition to volunteering and participating in life changing experiences, participants are able to grow their photography skills through workshops with professionals.</p>
<h3>Tanzania</h3>
<p>This summer TGL is partnering with Art in Tanzania, a non profit that works for the Tanzanian public in a multitude of ways including supporting artists, building and running schools as well as offering community programs such as clean water and HIV/AIDS education. Art in Tanzania has partnered with UNICEF to create the UNICEF Children's Agenda to further their children's programs.</p>
<p>Our work this summer will be documenting the work of Art in Tanzania and the UNICEF Children's Agenda and teaching photo skills to Art in Tanzania staff so they will be able to continue this documentation. We will also visit the native Maasai tribe to document their way of life for cultural preservation and work in the Maasai school which offers an education to the Maasai children who may have otherwise been pressured to participate in a mainstream education that would not honor their traditional Maasai heritage.</p>
<h3>Donations</h3>
<p>If you donate towards my trip you will be helping me to fund this amazing experience. The cost of the program is $3600 which includes all accomodations, meals, water, ground transportation, a 3 day safari and a donation to Art in Tanzania to ensure the furthering of their important work. Program cost does not include airfare and other various expenses such as visa fees and the cost of required and recommended vaccinations and/or perscriptions.</p>
<p>I am greatful for any help and to show my gratitude I have offered perks for different levels of donations!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This trip has great potential to further my phtography skill and career.

</div></div>","My Name is Tracey Clay.
I am graduating from the University of Northern Colorado this summer with a Bachelors in Anthropology and a Bachelors in Photo Imaging. My dream in life is to mix my two passions of photography and cultural studies into a career of travel and documentary photography. I believe that it is with this medium that change can happen in the world.
Now that you know a little bit about my background and my life dreams, you will understand why, when I learned of this trip, I just had to be a part of it!
The Giving Lens
The trip to Tanzania is with an organization called The Giving Lens. Founded by Colby Brown, a professional landscape, travel and humanitarian photographer and world-renouned photo-educator, TGL combines photography with humanitarian work around the world. By offering their cameras and their time, TGL teams help various non-profit organizations in any way needed. In addition to volunteering and participating in life changing experiences, participants are able to grow their photography skills through workshops with professionals.
Tanzania
This summer TGL is partnering with Art in Tanzania, a non profit that works for the Tanzanian public in a multitude of ways including supporting artists, building and running schools as well as offering community programs such as clean water and HIV/AIDS education. Art in Tanzania has partnered with UNICEF to create the UNICEF Children's Agenda to further their children's programs.
Our work this summer will be documenting the work of Art in Tanzania and the UNICEF Children's Agenda and teaching photo skills to Art in Tanzania staff so they will be able to continue this documentation. We will also visit the native Maasai tribe to document their way of life for cultural preservation and work in the Maasai school which offers an education to the Maasai children who may have otherwise been pressured to participate in a mainstream education that would not honor their traditional Maasai heritage.
Donations
If you donate towards my trip you will be helping me to fund this amazing experience. The cost of the program is $3600 which includes all accomodations, meals, water, ground transportation, a 3 day safari and a donation to Art in Tanzania to ensure the furthering of their important work. Program cost does not include airfare and other various expenses such as visa fees and the cost of required and recommended vaccinations and/or perscriptions.
I am greatful for any help and to show my gratitude I have offered perks for different levels of donations!


The Impact
This trip has great potential to further my phtography skill and career. I am very excited to have the opportunity to learn from some of the best photographers in a field that is of great interest to me. The environment has great potential to inspire and cultivate growing creativity and artistry through the support of other artists around me.
To be fully immersed in another culutre is a dream and passion of mine and will help to further open my eyes to all that the people of this world have to offer. The opportunity to give back in the process of all of this will be truly life changing.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is William Mueller, MFA Candidate at Ball State University in ceramics. I make functional ceramic works by 3D Printing my prototypes and casting them in plaster molds, these molds are then used to slip-cast my work. They are all cone 6 fired porcelain with underglaze applied onto the surface. All of the work is fully functional, food safe, dishwasher and microwave safe as well. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am running this campaign to help facilitate the purchase of a Shapeoko CNC Router. I am looking to expand my studio and work with other materials. The coffee stand in the image above is made with cast concrete which has had many issues with its fragility. Using a CNC Router I would be able to fabricate the stand with precision out of wood which would be much more gentle on the clay and better for a countertop. This router could help my studio practice by enabling me to create objects with wood that could not be made with traditional wood working tools. </p>
<p>By purchasing one of my ceramic works, you would be contributing to a young artist and help me build up my studio. The work in this sale is all very new to me, which is why I am marketing this as a seconds sale. A second, is a perfectly fine and functional ware but may have some small errors, some of the underglaze on the bottom stuck to the kiln shelf while firing leaving a few small white specs. Because of this, the prices are reduced to compensate. </p>

<p>If you cannot contribute financially that does not mean that you can not help this campaign. I would greatly appreciate this link being shared on any social media site as well as to friends and family!</p>

Each day at Glam Camp is filled with Glam inspired activities including challenges, tutorials, music and dance, and of course LOTS of makeup.  ""The Glow Up is Real"" and Glam Camp is coming soon to a city near you, and as part of our Glampaign initiative, we are raising capital to help our expansion for the years to come, while still maintaining the genuine core beliefs of Glam Camp.    We love our sponsors, and during our Glam Camp Glampaign we are giving backers the opportunity to not only contribute to our Glampaign, but to also help change lives. Sponsors will receive customized branding on our 2021 Glamp Camp Shirts where shirts will be worn by over 500 Glampers (which equates to 4500 hours or more of brand exposure), and a specialized Hyper-Link on Glam Camp’s website showcasing appreciation for you and or your business. Sponsors will also have the opportunity to send one child to Glam Camp in any of our locations, and forever change a young girl’s life. Please keep in mind Limited sponsorship spaces are available each year.  
Purchase of equipment and mass production of supplies needed to expand Glam Camp onto a national platform. This will include, the purchase of backdrops, customized flooring, transportable projector and digital screens, and professional videography and photography.
Glampers will receive the same personal experience of Glam Camp, but with a more uniform look in each featured city.
This year we are purchasing a Glam Camp trailer and developing a home base to house all of our supplies for each week of Camp.
Beauty Influencers will be traveling with us as we take Glam Camp National. Housing travel, and food is provided for each Beauty Influencer joining us on the road.
The upcoming year is all about branding! Glam Camp will be launching the first ever Glam Camp Product Line. This collection of products is inspired by a combination of our beautiful Glampers, and the Glam Camp brand itself.  It is specifically curated to fit the needs of age and social demographics within the camp year.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<a href=""http://internationalmuseumofart.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The International Museum of Art</a> - Texas History</h3>
<p>To Texans, there is nothing more important than preserving their history. To El Pasoans, being a city resting along the border of Texas and Mexico, our history is more unique than most. Often referred to as the Ellis Island of the south, more than 1,000,000 visitors enter into the United States each month through El Paso ports of entry to work, learn at our schools, colleges and universities, and to enjoy our beautiful city.</p>
<p>Who manages the Museum? The International Association for the Visual Arts, a Texas nonprofit 501 (c) 3 volunteer organization.</p>
<p>In the early days, the El Paso Art Museum Association, a volunteer citizen group, oversaw the museum's operations and also assisted in funding purchases for the El Paso Museum of Art's collection which was housed in the Turney home until a new museum was built closer to downtown. It was proposed to City officials by Mrs. Turney that her home remain a museum under the Association's leadership and remain separate from the City of El Paso Museum of Art. The City of El Paso currently leases the Turney home to the International Association for the Visual Arts (formerly the El Paso Art Museum Association).</p>
<h3>Project Summary</h3>
<p>As most of you know, the most important reason for any museum to exist is to collect and preserve a community's history. Within these confines lies the obligatory duty to keep precise records of its entire collection and to provide provenance, a place of origin or earliest known history of an object, to help tell its story. It is also important that a museum know the value of each and every object, and whether or not the object fits within their mission. It is also very important that a museum properly cares for their collection. Does the facility live up to modern museum standards regarding it being a temperature-controlled environment. </p>
<p>The International Museum of Art is moving forward to assure each of these points of interest come to be. The museum is going back to its roots and examining its entire collection. That is the goal of this proposed project. What exactly do we have? Where is it located? What is its condition? How is it stored? How can we better present our collection to the citizens of El Paso and our visitors from around the globe? </p>
<p>In order for us to represent El Paso, Texas in its best light we need to know everything there is to know about every object we own. This is our goal. The more we know about our history the more you will know. </p>
<p>This is a huge undertaking. One that we are very excited about. We look forward to you joining our team and assisting in the unveiling of even more El Paso history.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h3>What we are requesting ... and ... What you will receive</h3>
<p>1) Cataloging the collection. The collection consists of 10,000 objects. Broken into specific categories it consists of several historical sculptures created from bronze, porcelain, wood, jade, glass, and marble. The art collection dates back to the 1700s. Additional collections consist of the Kolliker collection, African artifacts, and Western Art. There is also an impressive collection of Shakyamuni Buddha statues. Buddha, as you probably know, was an ordinary person named Siddhartha Gautama whose profound insights continue to inspire the world even today. Throughout the museum is a beautiful collection of antique furniture. A Mexican Revolution exhibit and authentic Mexican and Polish dolls. The museum is also home to Asian woodblock prints and Japanese silk screens.</p>
<p>Cataloging the collection is estimated to cost $5,000.</p>
<p>2) Estimating the value of the collection.</p>
<p>Under the direction of a collections assessment manager, volunteers will photograph, index and evaluate every object. Estimated cost $10,000.</p>
<p>3) Proper storage of the collection. Acid free boxes and paper. Museum quality shelving. Estimated cost $5,000.</p>

<p>Once our Indiegogo program has come to a close by mid-May, all participants will be invited to a private reception for the International Museum of Art's featured summer exhibit, <i>The Reclusionist</i>.</p>
<p>This abstract impressionism exhibit will feature several works from reclusive El Paso artist James Robert Murphy, featured throughout these pages. Mr. Murphy is an award winning author and singer/songwriter who has called El Paso his home since 2004. </p>

<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/a55IfrdYrKM?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>Mr. Murphy earned an M.A. from the University of Oklahoma. He was employed by the City of El Paso as the development director for the El Paso Museum of History for a dozen years prior to his retirement in 2017. During his employment he raised well over $1M for the museum and its foundation in support of a variety of community programs. Raising funds for their permanent collection was one of these programs. Now, after retiring, and realizing the importance of an archived collection, his focus has turned to supporting the International Museum of Art. Mr. Murphy is also the founding member of the New York State Blues Festival which began in 1992. He served as festival director for 12 years. It continues to be one of Syracuse, NY's main festivals more than 25 years after it began.</p>
<p>Please join the Board of Directors in this passionate plea for support. With your help we can increase public awareness to one of El Paso's most precious museum collections.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risk and Challenges</h3>
<p>These days it seems there are a thousand and one organizations seeking financial and volunteer support. How does one decide where to offer assistance? We all lead such busy lives and barely have time for any extra curricular activities much less providing financial support to another worthy organization. We understand exactly how you feel. We, as a volunteer Board of Directors, are in the same boat. </p>
<p>But those of you who are taking the time to read through our story already have an interest in the arts and we truly appreciate that. <strong>Our goal</strong>, the big picture, the main focus of this request, is to better preserve Texas history. The goal of this campaign is to provide a true and interesting backstory about the International Museum of Art. We want to bring forward the way in which we care for and understand our permanent collection. It is so important for us to accomplish this. The Board of Directors asked themselves, ""How can we better serve our El Paso community? How can we better serve our youth, our membership and our visitors?"" The answer? By presenting our artifacts to the public in the most professional manner available. By providing quality information about the Museum's history and all that lies within our walls. By reaching out to the community and inviting them to experience what it is we have to offer. By encouraging our community members to use our facility for their special events. By letting our community know we are here for them. We want to be the best for you.</p>

<p>We also realize that not everyone can make a financial commitment. Not everyone can volunteer. To those who are already burdened with so many other projects, we want you to know you can still help us. <strong>Help us spread the word</strong> about this very special campaign to your friends, your relatives and your colleagues. We really do look forward to hearing from you.</p>

By reaching out to the community and inviting them to experience what it is we have to offer. By encouraging our community members to use our facility for their special events. By letting our community know we are here for them. We want to be the best for you.

Other ways you can help...
We also realize that not everyone can make a financial commitment. Not everyone can volunteer. To those who are already burdened with so many other projects, we want you to know you can still help us. Help us spread the word about this very special campaign to your friends, your relatives and your colleagues. We really do look forward to hearing from you.
Thank You!",1.0,1,"3 Campaigns

<p></p>
<p>The
Blue Ox Veterans Program is building an “Icon of Freedom” for our
nation; the hearse that carried President Lincoln for the final leg
of his national funeral procession. The hearse will be the
centerpiece during the 150<sup>th</sup>
anniversary commemorative ceremonies to be held in Springfield,
Illinois May 1-3, 2015.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The
Lincoln Funeral Coalition event mission statement is: <i>To
educate, coordinate and promote the accurate and dignified
re-enactment of the historic anniversary of Abraham Lincoln’s
funeral procession in Springfield, Illinois.</i>
The hearse is featured on the 2015 event tab at <a href=""http://www.LincolnFuneralCoalition.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">www.LincolnFuneralCoalition.org</a></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The
Blue Ox Veterans under the direction of Eric Hollenbeck, the founder
of Blue Ox Millworks and a Vietnam Veteran, have been working from
the only known photograph as the original hearse was destroyed by
fire. They are recreating the hearse wooden frame and chamber which
will be finished in maple. They are also recreating original molds
for all the decorative details which are cast in aluminum then gold
and silver leafed.

<h3>A School For Veterans</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The
Blue Ox Historic Park has always been a place of healing. For the
last fifteen years Blue Ox has served as a community high school
program, allowing at-risk teens an opportunity to learn in a
project-based environment. This newest Blue Ox Program represents a
long standing commitment to create a safe haven for veterans allowing
them an opportunity to develop a new self-identity through meaningful
hands-on craftsmanship.</p>
<p>These
veterans, who have served our country in Iraq and Afghanistan
among other places, have found a sense of peace and of healing by
working on this project. ""It’s my church,"" says Mercedes
Cangas. ""My children’s children will be able to see this
hearse and say ‘My daddy worked on this’,"" says Andrew
Olufsen.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The
Blue Ox Veterans Program is part of the non-profit Blue Ox Historic
Village and School. We are soliciting funds to maintain the Veterans

<h2>Caledonia</h2>
<p>Caledonia is a huge egg-shaped lookout tower that will be open to the entire Burning Man community, right next to center camp...but only if we can raise $4k to finish the guardrails and facade.  SpinCycle (theme camp for hoopers) is funding 70% of the expenses for Caledonia; we're asking for your help to raise the last 30%.  </p>
<p>This is SpinCycle's fourth year on the playa.  SpinCycle provides a home for hoopers at Burning Man, hosting hoopjams and other events.  Caledonia was designed by Rich Porter, an architect and one of the SpinCycle organizers.</p>
<h3> Where are the funds going?</h3>
<p>The basic structure has already been funded.  The trusses, shade sails, sound system... we've been able to purchase that already.  The facades and guardrails, required for the aesthetic and safety of the project, require additional financial support.  We're out of cash, so Caldenia cannot be gifted to our beautiful community without your support.</p>
<h3>Who is building this? </h3>
<p class=""p1"">SpinCycle is a Burning Man theme camp organized by Rich Porter and Grant Leonard and home to about a hundred others each year.  Together they've built large scale festival environments for over 6 years, recently completing Oysterfest alongside the Do Lab.  They have done shade lighting and sound for HoopCamp  every year and continue to expand the reach of their unique tensile structure environments.</p>
<p class=""p2""> Rich's practiced architecture for 5 years before leaving the field to pursue hooping full-time.  He now runs an edtech startup with his brother Rob.  The first time he hooped as an adult was the first day he met Grant Leonard.</p>
<p class=""p2""> Grant is a musician, contractor, and hooper from San Luis Obispo, CA.  As the bass player for Tropo, he tours california playing gigs , having opened for Random Rab and many others.  Tropo will be headlining Rise Festival and HoopCamp in 2012.  </p>

<div>  Hello one and all! We want to announce the opening of our Indiegogo campaign to support the King Jelly Art Car. You may have seen its brilliant lights, or even reclined on its white furry cushions last burn. Or even been on it when it broke down. </div>
<div>  We decided to return it to full life and health, and want to ask you for support. The rear differential needed gears reground and new bearings, the 36V electric motor needed rebuilding, and the ancient resistor coil speed controller needed replacing with a modern solid state high amperage speed controller. Last year it worked up to a point, this year we plan daily and nightly use of our machine! </div>
<div>  Lighting! We have stepped up to new flexible water proof fully programmable and assignable lighting strips. Last year was gorgeous, this year is going to be out of this world! </div>
<div>  Our sound system last year was small. This year we plan a four Mackie and a sub system with a DJ booth, to better create sound scenes! </div>
<div>  Our trailer was open to the air last year, and required the King Jelly to be disassmbled for transport. This year we plan to enclose that trailer so the King Jelly can arrive en playa fully made and ready to go. And the trailer will serve as its home, so the King Jelly can be used to add to the vibe of any number of events, from DeCompressions to ReCompressions to Art Walks, and much more! </div>
<div>    Last but not least we would love some help paying for all the fuel it takes to get it to the playa and back as well as what it takes for the generators to run the sound system and provide juice for the batteries.</div>

<h3>About our camp:</h3>
<p>We are happy to announce that this is our 6th year running our summer camp. The good news is that we are funded by the Status of Women to deliver the expressive art workshops. The bad news is that we can't run the camp without raising matching funds. </p>
<p><span>This is where YOU can make a difference, we are counting on your help and support to help the youth continue to receive the benefits of the Art &amp; Leadership summer camp.</span></p>
<p>Our camp is broken down like this:</p>
<p>Week 1: Understanding Equity &amp; Social Gender Roles<br/>Week 2: Understanding Oppression -Power and Control Tactics, Exploring the Cycle of Abuse, and Discussing Issues around Body Image<br/>Week 3: Leadership &amp; Empowerment- Celebrating diverse women and our achievements</p>
<h3>Impact: </h3>
<p>We always strive to provide a dynamic experience to the youth by enabling them to explore these topics through the use of media, technology, expressive art (graffiti, drawling, painting, playback theatre, etc) and recreational activities.</p>
<p><em>""The summer camp was a learning experience for me. I learned to appreciate my body and that we are all unique because we all have different characteristics. My favourite part were the field trips with the other girls. Before I came to the camp I was really shy. Being able to talk to the other girls without being critiqued made me feel relaxed. I really looked forward to camp everyday!"" - Yanet, 17</em></p>
<p><em>“When I heard about the opportunity to be a part of the PSA's for MUJER I really saw that as a chance to reach out to some of the young women in my community and tell them that they aren't alone.

I felt really empowered about what I was a part of that day and would love to be a part of something like this in the future.” – Adriana, 18</em></p>

<h3>A promotional video on GAUDIYA NRITYA- the classical dance of Bengal</h3>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/112917/files/20131004093939-6a.jpg?1380904779"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>The story so far...</h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A dance form was lost in the sands of time. One individual labored hard for many years, studied the scriptures, travelled to remote locations to study the carvings on ancient temples. She persevered, gave it her all and dedicated her life to this art. The result? The art is now revived, and reborn.</p>
<h4>All this sounds like a good plot for a movie, but it isn’t. It is true. The individual is Guru Sreemati Dr. Mahua Mukherjee. And the art form is called Gaudiya Nritya, the classical dance of Bengal, India.</h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">When we at Gadurr Media first heard of this story, we were not too impressed. We didn’t realize the importance of this struggle. But then we met Dr. Mukherjee, we heard the story of her struggle in her own words. We learnt of her dedication and conviction, of her ventures into the unknown, pursuing a dream that not many thought possible, and of the three decades of her perseverance. And it is then that we  realized the enormity of it all.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We did our research, saw hours and hours of performances, visited  temples in remote parts of Bengal, and read through research papers and books (yes, a lot of books). We saw the efforts that the artists put in on a daily basis, in spite of having more pressing educational commitments. Here were MBBS, M.Tech and Phd students, traveling all across India and performing in less than agreeable conditions, just because of their love for this art.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Thats when we decided that we needed to do something about it. The story had to be told. The message had to be spread. The art had to get its long-due recognition. Thats why we decided to take this up as our first social responsibility initiative. Thats why we are here on Indiegogo.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/113134/files/20131004120136-2a.jpg?1380913296"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<h3>What do we want to achieve?</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Increase awareness of this classical dance form, within the Bengali community, the Indian art lovers and classical art lovers worldwide</li>
<li>Recognition for Gaudiya Nritya- the art, the artists and the pioneer Dr. Mahua Mukherjee</li>
<li>Preservation of this ancient tradition</li>
<li>Increase awareness of this wonderful journey of over thirty years of Dr. Mukherjee and celebrate her dedication to this art</li>
<li>Increase in the number of persons practicing the art, both in India and worldwide</li>
</ul>
<h3>How do we plan to go about it?</h3>

<p></p></span></span></span></div>","A promotional video on GAUDIYA NRITYA- the classical dance of Bengal


The story so far...


A dance form was lost in the sands of time. One individual labored hard for many years, studied the scriptures, travelled to remote locations to study the carvings on ancient temples. She persevered, gave it her all and dedicated her life to this art. The result? The art is now revived, and reborn.
All this sounds like a good plot for a movie, but it isn’t. It is true. The individual is Guru Sreemati Dr. Mahua Mukherjee. And the art form is called Gaudiya Nritya, the classical dance of Bengal, India.
When we at Gadurr Media first heard of this story, we were not too impressed. We didn’t realize the importance of this struggle. But then we met Dr. Mukherjee, we heard the story of her struggle in her own words. We learnt of her dedication and conviction, of her ventures into the unknown, pursuing a dream that not many thought possible, and of the three decades of her perseverance. And it is then that we  realized the enormity of it all.
We did our research, saw hours and hours of performances, visited  temples in remote parts of Bengal, and read through research papers and books (yes, a lot of books). We saw the efforts that the artists put in on a daily basis, in spite of having more pressing educational commitments. Here were MBBS, M.Tech and Phd students, traveling all across India and performing in less than agreeable conditions, just because of their love for this art.
Thats when we decided that we needed to do something about it. The story had to be told. The message had to be spread. The art had to get its long-due recognition. Thats why we decided to take this up as our first social responsibility initiative. Thats why we are here on Indiegogo.



What do we want to achieve?



Increase awareness of this classical dance form, within the Bengali community, the Indian art lovers and classical art lovers worldwide
Recognition for Gaudiya Nritya- the art, the artists and the pioneer Dr. Mahua Mukherjee
Preservation of this ancient tradition
Increase awareness of this wonderful journey of over thirty years of Dr. Mukherjee and celebrate her dedication to this art
Increase in the number of persons practicing the art, both in India and worldwide

How do we plan to go about it?

We have already swung into action. A detailed website and social media presence has been created so that our message can reach people far and wide. Please visit us at
www.gaudiyanritya.org
 and send us your comments and suggestions. 
You can stay tuned in to our facebook page at 
www.facebook.com/GaudiyaNritya
and follow us on Twitter at
www.twitter.com/GaudiyaNritya
The next stage of our campaign is to create a documentary and a promotional video for Gaudiya Nritya. We are already halfway through the documentary and in the pre-production stage for the promotional video. With your support, we can shoot this promotional video (of 180 seconds) and approach sponsors for broadcasting this video on regional and national channels in India. 
You can view our detailed plans and its progress at

<h2><strong>What is The Picture Us Project</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>You’ve browsed the fashion sites and blogs, you’ve written comments, you’ve clicked the like buttons, you’ve shared the latest fashion trends with friends … now it’s time for you to be in the spotlight.  </strong></h3>
<p>The Picture Us is a project that blurs the fine line between art and fashion, where you (the follower of fashion and style) have an active role in the creative process. The brainchild of London based artist, luxury accessories designer and leather artisan <a href=""http://www.alexandruadam.com/about.asp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Alexandru Adam</a> and his sister Ruxandra Adam, it features a collaboration with internationally acclaimed blogger and photo journalist <a href=""http://yvanrodic.com/about"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Yvan Rodic</a>, the man behind <a href=""http://facehunter.blogspot.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facehunter</a>.</p>
<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>One November afternoon, while I (Alexandru) was chatting to my sister, Ruxandra, about the role of the audience in fashion and design we came up with the idea of a project that extends the role of the audience from spectator to active participant in creating fashion pieces. Seeing how the trend of the ‘selfie’ exploded overnight, we realized that individuals like you have a creative side worthy of being seen. We contacted Yvan Rodic and presented him the concept over lunch. He loved the idea and The Picture Us Project was born.</p>
<h2>What is the project and how can you take part?</h2>
<p><img alt=""The Marilyn Analogy - The Picture Us Project"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://thepictureusproject.com/img/indie/M_Analogy.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""The Marilyn Analogy""/></p>
<h2>Take a ‘Selfie’</h2>
<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""The Selfie""><strong>Selfie</strong></a> (Plural <strong><em>selfies</em></strong>)- <em>a genre of self-portrait photograph, typically taken with a hand-held digital camera or a smartphone camera.</em></p>
<p>Take your smartphone, tablet, camera and take a ‘selfie’ expressing one of six emotions and submit them to the project’s website <a href=""http://www.ThePictureUsProject.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.ThePictureUsProject.com</a>.  (Make sure you read the requirements carefully: white background, portrait only).</p>
<p>You have up to 6 categories of emotions you can choose from: <strong>happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust</strong> (repulsion) <strong>and confusion</strong>.</p>
<h2>The Site<strong><br/></strong>
</h2>
<p>Alexandru Adam and Yvan Rodic will select which photos will make it to the site and you will have a chance to see your selfies among others on the site.<br/> <img alt=""The Site - The Picture Us Project"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://thepictureusproject.com/img/indie/TheSite.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""The Picture Us Project""/></p>
<h2><strong>The Print</strong></h2>
<p>This is not a regular digital print. It’s a fine art silk-screen print, done by hand - the same process used by pop artists such as Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and Robert Rauschemberg in their works, to name but a few. </p>

<h2><strong>Where the money goes</strong></h2>
<p>We need your help to organize the exhibitions, create the prints and produce the first batch of bags.</p>
<p><strong>Here is how we will invest the funding we receive:</strong></p>
<h3>1. The Exhibitions</h3>
<p>With your support we will secure two exhibition spaces in galleries in London and Paris and cover the costs in organizing the events – from framing the prints to transporting and insuring the works. </p>
<h3>2. The Production</h3>
<p>We need your support to cover the costs of production for the first batch including the creation of the silk screen collage frames. We are very excited about this project and the impact it will have and hope that you are too.  </p>
<h2><strong>The Outcome</strong></h2>
<p><strong>This project offers anyone the chance to become an active part of a fashion project and to be involved in its creative process. </strong><strong>The Picture Us Project also explores the visual identity of the followers of fashion. With your help we will put together a collection, which will celebrate the individuals who have so far been represented only by a number of 'likes' and 'shares'.  </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></h2>
<p>We know that timely fulfillment of rewards is extremely important. We have already identified time and resources needed to complete this project at any quantity (even if it exceeds our £20,000 goal). Relationships have already been secured with manufacturers who we will work with to deliver the production on time. </p>
<p>We really hope to get your rewards to you mid-November, but we are allowing some buffer time until the end of November.</p>
<p>All we need now is your support. Please share our project with your friends and family. We are ready to send The Picture Us fashion pieces around the world.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p></p></span></div>","What is The Picture Us Project
You’ve browsed the fashion sites and blogs, you’ve written comments, you’ve clicked the like buttons, you’ve shared the latest fashion trends with friends … now it’s time for you to be in the spotlight.  
The Picture Us is a project that blurs the fine line between art and fashion, where you (the follower of fashion and style) have an active role in the creative process. The brainchild of London based artist, luxury accessories designer and leather artisan Alexandru Adam and his sister Ruxandra Adam, it features a collaboration with internationally acclaimed blogger and photo journalist Yvan Rodic, the man behind Facehunter.
Our Story
One November afternoon, while I (Alexandru) was chatting to my sister, Ruxandra, about the role of the audience in fashion and design we came up with the idea of a project that extends the role of the audience from spectator to active participant in creating fashion pieces. Seeing how the trend of the ‘selfie’ exploded overnight, we realized that individuals like you have a creative side worthy of being seen. We contacted Yvan Rodic and presented him the concept over lunch. He loved the idea and The Picture Us Project was born.
What is the project and how can you take part?

Take a ‘Selfie’
Selfie (Plural selfies)- a genre of self-portrait photograph, typically taken with a hand-held digital camera or a smartphone camera.
Take your smartphone, tablet, camera and take a ‘selfie’ expressing one of six emotions and submit them to the project’s website www.ThePictureUsProject.com.  (Make sure you read the requirements carefully: white background, portrait only).
You have up to 6 categories of emotions you can choose from: happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust (repulsion) and confusion.
The Site

Alexandru Adam and Yvan Rodic will select which photos will make it to the site and you will have a chance to see your selfies among others on the site. 
The Print
This is not a regular digital print. It’s a fine art silk-screen print, done by hand - the same process used by pop artists such as Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and Robert Rauschemberg in their works, to name but a few. 

Your ‘Selfie’ and Your Bag
If your selfies have been selected to be shown on www.ThePictureUsProject.com then you have a chance to also purchase a bag with your face among a collage of other faces.  The bags have been designed by designer Alexandru Adam in collaboration with Yvan Rodic and can be bought here.
The Bags
You have the option of buying one of 2 designs: The Weekender and The Backpack.  Additionally you have the option of choosing from 4 colour combinations for each: salmon pink or grey for the hardwearing linen fabric and dark brown and black for the leather details. We send an email out to all those who purchase our bags to get their choice of colours.
A maximum of 50 selfies will be silkscreen printed on each bag at a time.


 
The Options for Your Contribution









Where the money goes
We need your help to organize the exhibitions, create the prints and produce the first batch of bags.
Here is how we will invest the funding we receive:
1. The Exhibitions
With your support we will secure two exhibition spaces in galleries in London and Paris and cover the costs in organizing the events – from framing the prints to transporting and insuring the works. 
2. The Production
We need your support to cover the costs of production for the first batch including the creation of the silk screen collage frames. We are very excited about this project and the impact it will have and hope that you are too.  
The Outcome
This project offers anyone the chance to become an active part of a fashion project and to be involved in its creative process. The Picture Us Project also explores the visual identity of the followers of fashion. With your help we will put together a collection, which will celebrate the individuals who have so far been represented only by a number of 'likes' and 'shares'.  
Risks and challenges
We know that timely fulfillment of rewards is extremely important. We have already identified time and resources needed to complete this project at any quantity (even if it exceeds our £20,000 goal). Relationships have already been secured with manufacturers who we will work with to deliver the production on time. 
We really hope to get your rewards to you mid-November, but we are allowing some buffer time until the end of November.
All we need now is your support. Please share our project with your friends and family. We are ready to send The Picture Us fashion pieces around the world.",14.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<h1><strong>What is Beautiful Voices Art Program?</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Beautiful Voices is an Art Program that The Rag Collection will begin this fall at StreetlightUSA for teen girls rescued out of sex-trafficking in Phoenix, AZ.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Beautiful Voices Art Program will be a consistent weekly art space where each girl will engage at her own pace with media she wants to use, and with many creative options at her disposal.  It is space, tools, materials and curriculum that invites each girl to enter the creative process, to begin to express, play, identify her personal voice, and dream about the future.  </strong></p>
<h1>Why start an Art Program?</h1>
<p>The horrible truth of the effects of abuse is that the voices of these girls have been trampled on in ways that severely hinder growth, identity, and restoration. We believe that the voices of these girls are not only valuable to our community, but also to themselves.</p>
<p>It is our desire to provide room and resources for each girl to rediscover, uncover, and begin to unbury the beauty of her voice. This process takes time, but art is another door to the heart that encourages this process.</p>

<li>
<strong>Resources:  Tools and Materials  </strong>We are excited to bring in a wide range of materials including mixed media, writing, pottery, photography, painting, drawing, dance, etc. We will also be looking into connecting girls to arts resources in their community when appropriate.

Art is a tool that makes the emotions more accessible. 


Art calms anxiety, fears, and the mind so that other emotions can be expressed and valued.


Art is fun.


Art creates a safe space for new connections with self and others.


Art is a healing tool that allows self discovery. 


Art is a great way to offer these girls choices for how they want to be heard, seen, and what they want for their lives!

FGM seeks to encourage and improve the cultural exchange between artists and collaborating communities. This program is inspired by D. Fleiss &amp; East West Artists International (DFEWA) whose mission is to establish a working cooperation that will encourage and improve the cultural exchange between outstanding artists of varying backgrounds from eastern and western countries. DFEWA continues to achieve this aim by working in close contact with artists from all around the world. Artists who participate in the symposiums create a broader understanding of the contemporary arts in their respective communities around the world. Symposiums are held in locations throughout the Eastern and Western Hemispheres.</p>
<p>During FGM, artists will be provided housing, studio space, all meals, trips to cultural centers, and selected artist supplies at no cost to them.  Lifting these financial burdens for the artists provides them the opportunity to explore their creativity with themselves and others. Artists will be collaborating on Long Island from September 27 through October 7, 2013.</p>
<p>This program brings art professionals from around the world together to form new networks, foster international connections, develop cross-cultural understanding, and cultivate cooperation. As a FGM collaborator, the Islip Art Museum will arrange a series of events enabling the community, general public, and local artists, and art students to benefit from this exchange resulting in exposure to the various cultures and art making practices of all participating artists (please see schedule of events). The Patchogue Arts Council will be collaborating through arranging artists’ talks in Patchogue, and providing a gateway to other opportunities in the community such as exhibition.</p>
