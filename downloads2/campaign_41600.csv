We all have seen recycled paper and numerous other products on

Our vision is not just to cut the trees down and use them as materials for furniture or for heating, or anything else – our mission is to put some additional value to them, that is why we have created OVi Watches.OVi Watches are not only high quality, but also super light, which will allow you to wear them on any occasion – either it is on daily basis or at a wedding toasting to your friends’ happiness.        Started by young entrepreneurs and watch enthusiasts Ivo, Zintis and Dāvis, we set out to create a collection of wooden watches based on our passion for design, craftsmanship and timepieces.  Ivo Asns made the first prototype in Liepajas Design and Art College and now we are hoping to take one step closer to YOU by offering OVi watches.  & The dream has resulted in the first OVi watch collection.   The next step is the awesome crowd funding place called IndieGogo. We have made a working prototype that can change the way we live. All we need is just one more thing – Your SUPPORT!    We have designed the watches from scratch using modern tools. Our 3D models later became technical drawings which then were produced in Liepāja Design and Art College. We are not using any manufacturers to produce Ovi watches, and to keep high quality we will produce all of the OVi watches in our home town Liepāja. We aim to have a direct approach to our customers. Therefore, we avoided costly intermediaries, distributors and sales personal. The watches will only be sold through our own website and on Indiegogo. This is crucial, as we are trying to sell them for the best price possible.                                         1) 42mm casing crafted from natural hardwood2) Swiss made movement: Ronda, caliber 762 3H3)  Highly scratch-resistant sapphire crystal glass 4) 10.5 mm thick case include glass5) Genuine calf leather strap, which locks inside of the watch6) Steel waterproof crowns 7) Stainless steel screws and threads 8) Case and back is finished with high quality matt varnish For our first collection, we are offering four different materials to choose from          From now until the end of Ovi Watch campaign, you can refer your friends to get one Ovi Watch for free (referrals must total $899). Check out our rules here. We need YOU, too! We remind you that Indiegogo will allow us to raise the funds only if we reach our goal. We will try to promote the project in different ways,online and offline, and we hopethat through the use of social media and blogs we can address all traffic here. By sharing the page, promoting the project, publishing pictures with the #oviwatch hashtag You can really contribute to the spread of this fund-raiser. You just have to subscribe in Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to receive the latest news and share them with all your friends and followers.We have so many ideas for future watch designs and our dream is to become a well-known watch brand in the years to come.

When I wear their clothing and accessories I am raising awareness that fashion isn't just for young, able-bodied supermodels. It's for all of us. 



Fashion is for Every Body
To that end, I've partnered with Krystle Ramos, who owns vintage clothing boutique Pura Vida Vintage, to co-produce Music City's very first evening of inclusive runway segments featuring male and female models of all ages, races, sizes and abilities. Fashion is for Every Body will take place on Saturday, September 10th at 6pm at abrasiveMedia in Nashville. Local designers Evan Gray, Catland Forever Couture, Amanda Valentine, Nashville Fashion Forward Fund Recipient Eric Adler, Ola Mai, Black by Maria Silver will show some of their iconic Nashville clothing. Clothing from Pura Vida Vintage and Opium Vintage will also be featured, and John Thielman, Andrés Bustamante and ALTER UR EGO are presenting their debut collections.  Likewise, we have twenty models from age 18 to 50+, tiny to voluptuous, and about a third use mobility aids. They are excited to be a part of this project, as are the designers - some of them having shown just last week at Nashville Fashion Week 2016. 
Guests will enjoy light bites and a signature cocktail as well as a documentary which will play during changing breaks about how the show's participants view their contribution to fashion and inclusion in today's Nashville. The evening will conclude with a pop-up shopping event featuring clothing by the show's designers and boutiques and any artwork displayed on the walls of abrasiveMedia. The inaugural Fashion is for Every Body will pay tribute to David Bowie's iconic influence on fashion, style, and self-acceptance.
Please help us to show the world that, when it comes to fashion and style, we all matter and join us as we walk or roll down the runway!

Help Make This Show a Reality
Fashion shows are usually involved and expensive productions. We are fortunate to have Empower Tn - an organization dedicated to cultivating a barrier-free community where people with disabilities are valued equally and participate fully - assisting us in promoting the event. Likewise, everyone involved in the show is volunteering their time without payment. But we still have to pay for the venue, the food and drink, photo and video screens, chair rentals, programs, merchandise and, most importantly, lighting the runway. Every penny we collect beyond Indiegogo's fee will go towards funding Fashion is for Every Body. Any money we receive in excess of our needs will go towards next year's show. This is a not-for-profit venture.   In Return for Your Donation
We have some great, affordable perks. Donors can choose from a T-Shirt, Poster, Bracelet, Advanced Ticket, Program Sponsorship or Step-and-Repeat Sponsorship. Numerous Program Ad Packages are also available.

<p>Our fabric is the 1´st production line silk-chiffon, which is bought from
 finest fabric producers in Europe. Our fabric is the most 
hypoallergenic of all fabrics. An All-climate material, which is 
comfortably cool when temperatures rise. Its natural temperature-regulating 
properties give our fabric this paradoxical ability to cool and warm 
simultaneously. Our dresses thus outperform other fabrics in summer. Fabric is also highly absorbent and dries quickly. It
 can absorb up to 30% of its weight in moisture without feeling damp. 
Our dress silk-chiffon fabric will absorb perspiration while letting 
your skin breathe. In spite of dress delicate appearance, it is 
relatively robust and its smooth surface resists soil

Our fabric is the 1´st production line silk-chiffon, which is bought from
 finest fabric producers in Europe. Our fabric is the most 
hypoallergenic of all fabrics. An All-climate material, which is 
comfortably cool when temperatures rise. Its natural temperature-regulating 
properties give our fabric this paradoxical ability to cool and warm 
simultaneously. Our dresses thus outperform other fabrics in summer. Fabric is also highly absorbent and dries quickly. It
 can absorb up to 30% of its weight in moisture without feeling damp. 
Our dress silk-chiffon fabric will absorb perspiration while letting 
your skin breathe. In spite of dress delicate appearance, it is 
relatively robust and its smooth surface resists soil
 and odors well

<h3>My Story.</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p><b>Up until 6 ½ years ago, I had little aspirations of becoming a photographer. I didn't even know how to operate a camera.</b> I was in the grips of a serious drug and alcohol addiction, unemployed and frequently homeless. A troubled childhood led me to escape through sex, drugs and rock &amp; roll. To be honest, it worked for along time, until it just stopped working. Luckily, I was introduced to an exceptional recovery program and with the help of friends and family, I got clean and sober. Then I got honest with myself. I realized that I had sacrificed not only my health and security for my addictions, but also most of my goals. One of those was being a fashion photographer.</p>
<br/><p>As a child, I was fascinated with images of the fashion world. I would spend hours looking through catalogs and magazines, dreaming of being a model and living in “exotic, far away places.” Moreover, I was mesmerized by the works of Richard Avedon and Annie Leibowitz. I envied not only their talent behind the lens, but their access to a world of glamour and style.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1468445947/unspecified-5_wjcnia.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<br/><p>My desire to be a model has subsided, but my need to create images has amplified. I’m constantly studying and honing my skills in order to create the images I saw growing up and I'm forever asking questions about photography or fashion to anyone who will listen. Those who knows me well can attest to this. Seriously! I can go on and on, to a fault! It’s because now I realize that <b>not everyone gets a chance to live their dream and certainly fewer get a second chance.</b> For that I am truly grateful. So, no. I will probably never stop asking questions. And for this fault, I am also incredibly lucky.</p>
<br/><p><b>I feel compelled to share this side of me so I may hopefully inspire others to remember their own dreams and pursue them by any means necessary.</b> I am a true lover of fashion and I hope my work reflects that love. My daily path may sometimes vary, but my life's work is focused: the pursuit of fashion through photography.</p>

My name is Pete Hopkins and I am an aspiring fashion photographer and BFA student of Photography at the Academy of Art University. I am also the founder of The Valencia Street Review, a unique fashion/art/style blog based in San Francisco. I am incredibly focused and passionate about fashion photography and it shows in my work. 
Twice a year, I travel on my own to New York Fashion Week to photograph backstage, runway, and street style fashion. My close-up and narrative style has gained me intimate access to the fashion world. I've worked side by side with designers, stylists, models, and production teams and I see firsthand the ups and downs in the intensely competitive world of high fashion.
In addition, my work has been featured in People.com, Detail.com, and the AAU's 180 Magazine as well as spotlighting designer's works here and abroad. My next goal is to cover Fashion Month in it's entirety and create a photo book entitled, ""NEW YORK, LONDON, MILAN, PARIS, ME."". This is where I need your help. 



  

  

So What Is My Project? 
My goal is to create a book that shines the spotlight on my love for fashion. I plan to cover Fashion Month, from the runway to the street, in New York, London, Milan and Paris, from a distinctly insider's point of view. The story I want to tell is that fashion is more than just looking pretty. It is a way of affirming our individuality and being a part of the collective at the same time. It is our statement to one another - ""This is me. I am unique AND I belong."" This will manifest into a beautiful volume of work, depicting the world of fashion from a fine art photographer's perspective.



  



How Do You Participate?
Your contributions will aide me in creating a work of art that you and everyone you know will want. To do this, I need at least $12,000 and the breakdown of expenses is really simple: transportation, visa(s), food and lodging, press passes, gear and production costs, and overhead costs here at home. Let’s not forget Indiegogo’s cut, and a portion is budgeted for unseen expenses or emergencies.




Your Impact

1. You will have a direct hand in the book’s creation. I will include your name on the contributor's page in the book, as a bonus for your generosity. If that's not enough, I'm offering a bunch of special gifts for you (look right! >>>) in appreciation for joining the campaign.

2. Your support will aide me in my goal of obtaining a degree at the Academy of Art. My ongoing thesis is twofold. One part being a journalistic account of style and fashion around the globe and the other part being a purely aesthetic editorial of the same, yet from a fine art perspective.
3. You will be helping me achieve my lifelong dream of becoming an established fashion photographer. Your support will be strengthen my portfolio, support my ongoing education and further my professional career.







My Story.


Up until 6 ½ years ago, I had little aspirations of becoming a photographer. I didn't even know how to operate a camera. I was in the grips of a serious drug and alcohol addiction, unemployed and frequently homeless. A troubled childhood led me to escape through sex, drugs and rock & roll. To be honest, it worked for along time, until it just stopped working. Luckily, I was introduced to an exceptional recovery program and with the help of friends and family, I got clean and sober. Then I got honest with myself. I realized that I had sacrificed not only my health and security for my addictions, but also most of my goals. One of those was being a fashion photographer.
As a child, I was fascinated with images of the fashion world. I would spend hours looking through catalogs and magazines, dreaming of being a model and living in “exotic, far away places.” Moreover, I was mesmerized by the works of Richard Avedon and Annie Leibowitz. I envied not only their talent behind the lens, but their access to a world of glamour and style.



My desire to be a model has subsided, but my need to create images has amplified. I’m constantly studying and honing my skills in order to create the images I saw growing up and I'm forever asking questions about photography or fashion to anyone who will listen. Those who knows me well can attest to this. Seriously! I can go on and on, to a fault! It’s because now I realize that not everyone gets a chance to live their dream and certainly fewer get a second chance. For that I am truly grateful. So, no. I will probably never stop asking questions. And for this fault, I am also incredibly lucky.
I feel compelled to share this side of me so I may hopefully inspire others to remember their own dreams and pursue them by any means necessary. I am a true lover of fashion and I hope my work reflects that love. My daily path may sometimes vary, but my life's work is focused: the pursuit of fashion through photography.





The Challenges



The Events: You may be asking ""How are you going to get into all the shows? Do you know everyone?"" Not everyone, but I've got my ways. I reach out to industry officials, friends, family and colleagues and talk to everyone I meet about the best locations to shoot and the coolest events to attend. I spend equal time talking with strangers outside of the shows while taking photographs.



The Road: In my previous life, I was a drummer in a rock and roll band, so I know all about life on the road. I've experienced missed flights and angry customs agents, wrong directions, bad weather, sleeping on couches or no sleep at all. I've gotten sick, lost gear, been eaten alive by insects and have done a whole lot of waiting. Challenges are unavoidable and I've learned how to survive them.



Image Logistics and Production: I curate a style blog and I do all my own editing and archiving as I travel from city to city. For a campaign of this size, I will be upgrading my gear and boosting my editing capabilities. I will be processing all my work in state of the art labs to create the highest quality book that everyone will want on their coffee table.











Other Ways You Can Help



Alternative Support: Ideally, everything will be covered by your cash contributions. If I don't reach my goal of $12,000 (or more!), I will graciously make the most out of what I receive, but alternatives such as shared lodging, passes and invitations to shows, and covering expenses here at home would be most welcome. Food is plentiful and I rarely go hungry. Besides, this is fashion right? Nobody eats! JUST KIDDING! Send me all the care packages you like. I am very fond of peanut butter!


Word of Mouth: Just as important as contributing funds to the campaign is spreading the word about the project. Please share on social media, email and text others, tell a friend, let everyone you know about this project! You can follow along with my progress by liking my social media pages on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and by reading the dailies on my blog, www.thevsr.com. Don't forget to use Indiegogo's social media sharing tools after you make your donation.

Gratitude

One of the best pieces of advice I ever received was from Catherine Schuller. A former Ford model, plus size advocate, promoter and dear friend (who later hired me to cover her bi-annual runway production ""Runway the Real Way""). She told me, ""Pete, if you want to achieve, if you want success, the most important thing is to INCLUDE YOURSELF!"" I have applied these words to my own life with great results.

For instance, my first trip to New York as a photographer was to cover ""Hearst Fashion Hack"" held at Hearst Tower in Manhattan. I thought I was going to shoot fashionistas, but instead I was surrounded by engineers building fashion apps. Whoops! I'll admit that I'm a bit of a computer geek myself, but my plan was to cover NYFW, not a tech convention! 



Not to be discouraged, I finished my assignment and then walked seven blocks in a blizzard to Lincoln Center. I had no credentials nor connections, but I had come too far to give up! As luck would have it, I walked right in. I was awestruck and slack-jawed to be sure, but I snapped out of it quick in fear of being tossed out. With Catherine's words in my ears I started shooting, and enjoyed every minute of it.

The next day, I recounted my story to fashion reporter/guru Michael Quintanilla, and he assured me that I was very lucky indeed and opportunities like that don't happen all the time. He invited me to attend the Vivienne Tam and Ralph Rucci shows and I happily accepted. I shot the runway, went backstage, met the designers and was invited a number of other shows and events that week. From that moment on, I have always ""included myself"". Thanks Cat!










I would like to thank you all for your time and consideration and for participating in my project. I'm very happy that you are on-board with what I promise will be an amazingly successful adventure. - P.

<h1><br/></h1><h1>Possibilities and limitations</h1>
<h3>Minimal size</h3>
<p>The minimal size of a propeller is limited by the resolution
of your printer. I successfully printed 21mm short and single extrusion width
(0,4mm on my FDM 3D printer) thin blade propellers for my <a href=""http://www.hobbyking.co.uk/hobbyking/store/__91443__CX_Stars_Nano_Quadcopter_RTF_2_4GHz_Orange_Mode_2_Tx_.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CX-Stars Nano Quadcopter</a>.</p>

<p>Always remember to keep all the features of the

usually 45° and less.</p>
<p>This is the reason why the hole shape is a square standing
on its corner.</p>

Well... a few broken propellers months ago and my 3D printer.Still confused? Don't be, if you love drones and you are tired of constantly breaking your propellers and buying new ones choosing from a limited range, I have created a simple solution to allow you to have fun customising your propellers.Seeing my drone flying around with my own designed 3D printed propellers I just knew I had to share.I am fortunate to have the perfect combination of skills to make it happen - the result for you is a super easy template, that allows you to create your own custom propellers.All the propellers in the photo below are 3D printed.

5 reasons why 3D print your propellers

Replace broken propellers

Get new custom propellers within hours (small ones in minutes!)


Replace existing propellers (see making of 30 mm propellers below)


Customise propellers to your liking (see making of a 5 in propeller below)

Filament based colour choice

Rewards

A super easy to use template files designed for FDM 3D printing.

Customise simply by moving sliders


Straight forward export of your design (File>Export>STL)


Within Blender – Blender is free

A brief tutorial included with each template

See how easy it is below - just pick a parameter and move the slider
To create a propeller you just have to select a parameter you want to modify and move the slider. In regards to dimensions, use the on screen overlay rulers for the visual reference.

Do not worry, no actual Blender modelling skills are required!


The templates are created in Blender as it is a free open-source software. In addition to that it is an excellent solution to create this slider based control system which allows your imagination/design to go wild. This gives you a lot of freedom, so do not abuse it - please do a visual check to not go over your printers self-support angle (that is usually 45 degrees or less for FDM 3D printers).



Each template will include a brief tutorial on how to use it and how to go about the pitch angle and the shape of the particular propeller.
Guaranteed reward :)You are guaranteed to get what you see in the videos above – Parallel propeller template Alpha (as-is)

Technicalities
Stretch goal delivery
I will be releasing the unlocked Stretch goal propellers as
Beta and implementing your feedback in the 2nd/Final release in
February.


The red goals are unlocked


The white goal is the next in line


The grey goals are yet to be unlocked





I am full-time employed and developing products in my free
time. I will put my free time activates aside to focus on these deliverables
and do my best to deliver sooner than the dates indicated above.
Design process
I will be using the existing propellers as a design guide
where available, as I did with the Parallel propeller template.
The black propeller above is 3D printed using the white ones as guides.The red propeller above is 3D printed using the other two as guides.Suggest a new Stretch goal
Please feel free to suggest any other stretch goals to add
such as FDM 3D printing course, Design for 3D printing course, Blender
modelling fundamentals course etc.
Note that I will add stretch goals such as Propeller
template designing course only after all the other stretch goals are unlocked. 
Issues
I will design the templates so that they are optimised for
self-supported FDM 3D printing, as you can see done with the Parallel propeller

Printing one propeller at the time


Application of glue on the removable print
platform using a glue stick and then spreading if evenly using a bit of water


Inclusion of the Brim in your slicing strategy


Reduction of the 1st layer’s speed to
10% (It might take half of the total print time to print the 1st
layer but it will be firmly stuck to the print bed. Also the extrusion nozzle
will not peal of the already extruded filament because it moves so slow that it

<h3>In a nutshell:</h3>
<p>eskini's modular fashion looks awesome, is on-trend, it's patent-protected, and reduces waste.</p>

<li>My name is Erin Spaulding. I'm the owner and founder of the eskini brand and it's holding company. I'm also a valuation professional, I value whole companies as well as their specific brands, patents, trademarks and other intangible assets. I did not venture into the super-saturated industry of fashion until I was able to clearly define eskini's unique value-add and offer protection on our collective investment.</li>
<li>Like most women age 18-35, I'm very interested in and influenced by fashion as a consumer. Fashion, by market forces we ourselves create, is necessarily obsessed with newness, and responsible for more pollution and waste than any other industry <i>except</i> OIL.</li>
<li>I built eskini brand on a modular platform, with styles that reduce waste by allowing existing styles/sku's to be infinitely revitalized/reinvented/re-customized with new accessory straps. </li>
<li>Fashion is also a brutal business of copy-catting and idea theft. eskini's uniquely distinguishable strap (hooked at both ends) is also patent protected in its application to wearables. We can't be copied. Competitive commercial sale of this ""technology"" must be licensed from eskini.</li>
<li>Seed funding and professional contributions for the brand, patents, product development and production has been sourced from myself, my family and my close friends.</li>
<li>I have also found that as a direct retailer, my small team and I can facilitate the communication of our product's benefits more passionately and effectively. We are now retailing exclusively from eskini.com.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Now in early revenue stage, selling our eskiniMOD swimwear, lounge wear and accessories online at eskini.com, we need to gain traction and awareness for the innovative modular benefits by focusing outside investment in content-creation, social media, paid advertising and PR outreach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Content: photo &amp; video, used across social media channels (Budget: $1000/mo). We allocated 15% vesting over 3 years to a production company who produces our video content at no charge. Content expense only includes talent, location permits and props, if needed.</li>
<li>Social Media: a freelance social media manager handles posts, engagement and interaction with followers. (Budget: $500/mo)</li>
<li>Paid Advertising: Minimum budget for Google AdWords and Facebook Ads on an optimized cost-per-click basis (Budget: $600/mo). With premium video content, online commercial ads are additional. (Budget: $800)</li>
<li>Press Outreach: generating interest - inform editors and influencers to get them excited about something new and noteworthy in fashion. Most PR agencies charge a minimum monthly retainer of $2500 to $5000 for small brands. We work with freelancers in the editorial space who work on an hourly basis. (Budget: $1000/mo)</li>
<li><strong>For your involvement, we want to thank you. From a simple mention on eskini.com to a gift card for someone you love, all perks come with a great story about how you helped innovation thrive and the fashion industry (one of the world’s worst offenders) become less wasteful!

</div></div>","In a nutshell:
eskini's modular fashion looks awesome, is on-trend, it's patent-protected, and reduces waste.


 


My name is Erin Spaulding. I'm the owner and founder of the eskini brand and it's holding company. I'm also a valuation professional, I value whole companies as well as their specific brands, patents, trademarks and other intangible assets. I did not venture into the super-saturated industry of fashion until I was able to clearly define eskini's unique value-add and offer protection on our collective investment.
Like most women age 18-35, I'm very interested in and influenced by fashion as a consumer. Fashion, by market forces we ourselves create, is necessarily obsessed with newness, and responsible for more pollution and waste than any other industry except OIL.
I built eskini brand on a modular platform, with styles that reduce waste by allowing existing styles/sku's to be infinitely revitalized/reinvented/re-customized with new accessory straps. 
Fashion is also a brutal business of copy-catting and idea theft. eskini's uniquely distinguishable strap (hooked at both ends) is also patent protected in its application to wearables. We can't be copied. Competitive commercial sale of this ""technology"" must be licensed from eskini.
Seed funding and professional contributions for the brand, patents, product development and production has been sourced from myself, my family and my close friends.
I have also found that as a direct retailer, my small team and I can facilitate the communication of our product's benefits more passionately and effectively. We are now retailing exclusively from eskini.com. This direct to customer model gives us direct access to the end user - we send followup emails requesting simple click-option feedback - and our customers get much better prices (no keystone markup).

<a href=""www.togetherwearetribe.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TRIBE</a>
is a global, socially conscious fashion line that was created in Denver—but
with a desire to impact the world. Envisioned and dreamed into life by Rebecca
Taylor (fashion designer) and Sarah Hidey (international development
consultant)—two good friends with a common vision of empowering women—TRIBE has
a mission to provide opportunities to women around the world through the
provision of job skills and ethical employment in the fashion industry. TRIBE
plans to partner with fair-trade nonprofits and sewing studios to employ women
with barriers to employment both in the United States and Cambodia. 

<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>WHY??</b></p>
<p>As
two independent women who have worked and lived around the US and the world, we
strongly believe that women of all ethnicity and walks of life, wherever they
live, should have the opportunity to thrive &amp; to live abundant lives. Lives
where they can have fulfilling employment that allows them to provide for their
families through a living wage, learn new skills and be empowered to follow
their passions and dreams. </p>
<p>We
truly believe that no matter where we are, as woman, we are part of a larger
tribe of women who want the same things: purpose, love, to provide for our
families, good health, to thrive and be inspired. And this inspires us to
connect women around the world so that they can support each other</p>
<p>Unfortunately,
in many parts of the world, and even here in Denver, many women (such as
refugees and women living in poverty) face extreme barriers to employment, a
lack of skills and a lack of opportunities that are not exploitative and
unsafe. With a commitment to empowering women, a love for fashion that is ethically
produced, and inspired by the vibrant fabrics from around the world, TRIBE was
born. </p>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>TRIBE
wants to change the fashion industry, so that the focus is on PEOPLE and not
just PROFITS. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470362082/image2_copy_phdgkf.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 608.81px;height: 819px;""/></p>
<p>Did
you know? </p>
<ul><li>
<span><span></span></span>Many of the approximately <b>40 million workers</b> in the global fashion/garment industry are
forced to work in sweatshops or factories with exploitative conditions</li></ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul><li>
<b>85% of garment workers are women</b>, and the majority are in developing
countries and live in some degree of poverty</li></ul>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>What are sweatshops?</b> Sweatshops are factories
that often have oppressive work environments; unfair and extremely low wages;
long hours; unsafe facilities; and sometimes allow child labor and no pay
(slavery).  A
direct result of the “fast fashion” trend, garment workers are often forced to work
longer hours for less money as global fashion brands (i.e., apparel available
in chain stores across the country) demand lower costs so that they can sell
clothing for only a few dollars to consumers. 
</p>
<p><b>Does what we pay for clothing matter? </b></p>
<p>Yes.
If we are buying cheap clothing, then we are enabling cheap labor. Whereas
people used to invest in a few pieces of clothing to last years, the advent of
the $5 t-shirt has allowed consumers to shop ‘til we drop, often at the expense
of the garment worker who receives only pennies for their days work. <br/></p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>
<p>Our solution to the exploitation and low wages prevalent in
the global fashion industry is a fashion line that puts PEOPLE first, and not
profit. It is a fashion line that is inspired BY women, purchased BY or FOR
women and that benefits women globally.  </p>
<p>When we
visit many fair trade stores across the US and on our travels, the ethically-produced
clothing we see are not clothing that we would want to wear. The majority of
fair-trade clothing options were not designed for the modern, trendy woman who
wants the vibrant colors of Africa or Asia melded with the classic and
flattering styles of the West. </p>
<p>This
is where TRIBE was born— at the intersection of ethical employment, globally
inspired fabrics and flattering design. <br/></p>

Being perfectly well dressed gives one a tranquility that no religion 
can bestow. A gentleman’s wardrobe is indeed a work of art and every 
essential piece reflects the wearers’ own unique personality - in what 
way does one express their own unique personality than through 
accessories.An accessory is an item, which is used to contribute, in a secondary 
manner, to the wearer’s outfit. Accessories are often used to complete 
an outfit and are chosen to specifically complement the wearer’s look. 
What we have found with men is that we are limited to the basic ties, 
belts, watches, pocket squares and cufflinks. Our goal is to 
offer something new and refreshing that will polish any look and bring 
it all together, therefore we have created Collar Links. These are 
similar to cufflinks but designed specifically for the collars of men’s 
dress shirts. Collaration LLC Collar Links and Collar Stays have a 
groundbreaking approach that takes collar stays to the next level.These unique links will give life to any collar. Standout without trying
 to get noticed, be the conversation piece and the envy of others who 
dare set foot in a room with you. Start the trend, set the trend and 
become the trend with Collaration Collar Links and Collar Stays as we 
bring sophistication to the collar inside and out.Collaration is a one man shop based in Orlando FL. The creator and 
founder Durand Smith has been putting all his blood, sweat and tears 
into every aspect of Collaration for the past two years and finally he's
 seeing some results. Collaration has been approved to sell our product 
in the Artegon Market Place Mall in Orlando Florida and we have been 
approved an exhibiting booth at the MAGIC Marketplace, the world's 
largest fashion marketplace tradeshow comprised of ten unique 
communities showcasing the latest in apparel, footwear, accessories, and
 manufacturing. With your pledges all funding will go towards 
manufacturing our collar links on a greater scale, materials to produce 
products and equipment for both booths here at the Artegon Market Place 
Mall and MAGIC Marketplace. We ask that you help one man’s dream 
starting with one collar at a time. Click Here To Visit SiteRisks and challenges

funding The GSA Degree Show 2015. It was an excellent night out with the whole school
with good vibes, good music and great art. 




















#theGSAFlea
8 – 10 January 2015
SIT Building @ Temasek Polytechnic
   The Glasgow
School of Art Singapore's opened our first ever flea market at the Singapore
Institute of Technology (SIT) Building at Temasek Polytechnic. Held in
conjunction with Temasek Polytechnic’s Open House, #theGSAflea had a wide
selection of handmade crafts, accessories, letterpress items, art and design
books and prints by our awesome vendors! The GSA Singapore had our own Art Sale
booth going on with posters, zines, caricature booth and a photo booth all
efforts by the graduation class of 2015. All funds raised during the flea went
towards The GSA Degree Show 2015. All in all, #theGSAflea that spanned over 3 days
was super fun, and a fantastic start for more fleas in the future.

<p> Of course the initial idea for the strong case came from the reports

research and found out that other mobile devices are also becoming 
vulnerable due to their larger size and thin profile. </p>

<p>DESIGN</p>
<p>It
is nice to have an enclosure made of plastic, leather, fabric or
rubber for the basic mechanical protection against damage and also
for reasons of aesthetics and comfort in use by having a tactile
material. I chose plastic as one can mould in several features for
the functions I want my protective case to have. However, these
materials cannot provide much protection against bending or pressure
unless they are rather thick and we do not want to end up with a
chunky enclosure for a nice and slim device.</p>
<p>
The
only other solution is to use a very rigid material, such as steel,
to provide the rigidity that is needed in the case to protect the
mobile device against bending. Attempts have been made to make metal
enclosures for mobile phones. However, they have a problem: the
manufacturers of these mobile devices do not like metal, carbon fibre
or magnets in the proximity of their devices as they can cause
interference to their radio signals and their sensors such as
magnetic compass, proximity sensor and gyroscope. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1214407/files/20150211091224-metal_in_case.jpg?1423674744"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<div>My
solution is to add a reinforcing element to the soft case, made of
steel and inserted in the plastic body of the case. However, this
element must not add considerable weight to the case, it must not
make the case too chunky and it must not be close to the mobile
device when it is in use. I designed a metal component based on my
calculations of maximum strength with the minimum of material used
and this is the resulting shape: it adds aesthetic value to the case
too. But this is not all: I have designed it in such a way that the
metal part is close the the mobile phone when not it use and stored
such as in a trouser rear pocket. However, when the case is opened
for use, the metal part is moved away from the device so that it will
not cause interference.<p>Early test pieces to determine the size 
and number of steel members that will provide the maximum reinforcement 
with the minimum of weight and thickness.</p>

<p> PRESENT STATUS</p>
<p>So
where am I now? I am making these cases on a small scale by 3D
printing, this is limiting in the numbers I can produce and the price
of the products is high so I need to take it to the real production
methods that will allow me to make a quality product at an affordable
price and in large quantities. These production methods are injection moulded plastic and metal.</p>
<p>PATENT</p>
<p>I
have applied for a patent for this product and its inventiveness is
protected. Britsh Patent application number: GB1423232.6</p>
<p>And I own the copyright to the product image.</p>

<br/>
<div>
<p>YOUR MONEY PLEDGE - WHY I NEED YOUR SUPPORT</p>
<p>Your kind
contributions will be used for adapting the design for production, to
manufacture the injection moulding tools for plastic and to order the
first production units for sale. I have already invested a considerable 
number of man hours and in the making of the prototoypes and testing 
getting the product to its present stage of development.</p>
<p>I have 
already started putting together a marketing plan that includes the 
product price and substantial promotion, primarily through the Internet.
 I intend to sell the product through my company and grow the product 
line.</p>
<p>Of
course this is not going to be the only product. I will continue to
make new versions for other mobile devices, including the iPads,
Kindles and the like.

the market for all of you to enjoy.</p>
<p>MY BACKGROUND</p>
<p>I have a Masters degree in Product Design from the prestigious
      Central Saint Martins University of the Arts in London. I have 
more than 35 years of experience working on product design continuously.
 I have my own design consultancy business and I have a proven track 
record of products that have returned substantial profits for my 
clients.<br/>
<br/>
Added to this, I have designed several IT products for use in extreme 
environments in fields such as transport, medicine, shipping, the army, 
the navy, office and consumer products. I have taken my know-how from 
the design of rugged products to the consumer and commercial product 
fields, such as on this product.<br/>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>There are always challenges in the process to take a new product to 
the market. Here are the most common types and how I will tackle them 
with my experience:</p>
<p>1-There is not enough interest in the product to generate substantial sales.
<br/>Solution: I have experience with taking the products I design until 
they reach the market, so I know that there have been some that did not 
quite make it....My solution to this would be to make sure that I sell 
enough of them, at a reduced price, in order to recover the investment 
and move on to another product idea...</p>
<p>2- I may have underestimated the cost to take the product to the 
market. Perhaps the injection moulding tools will be more expensive, the
 process to adapt the product to production is more costly and time 
consuming or there is not enough funding for marketing.
<br/>Solution: I will seek further funding from a Business Angel, grants,
 government help. I will try everything in the way of matching funds 
against what I have managed to raise through Kickstarter.</p>
<p>3- My product gets copied. It happens to the best of people.
<br/>Solution: I have a patent application, which will be of great help, if and when it is granted, in order to defend my territory.</p>
<p>4- I end up with a one product company. When the product reaches the end of its life, there will be nothing else to sell.
<br/>Solution: That is why I am thinking of the new versions of the 
product for other types of mobile device. There a loads of them: 
Kindles, all kinds of iPADS, Galaxy phones, you name them.</p>

products for mobile devices. The first case is for the iPhone 6. The 
iPhone 6+ version will follow and then cases for the most popular and 
most vulnerable mobile devices in the market. The possibilities to 
extend the product line are endless!


The first item in the range is for the iPhone 6





A versatile case for your mobile device


 Of course the initial idea for the strong case came from the reports
 of 'Bendgate' about the iPhone 6 and 6+. However, I did further 
research and found out that other mobile devices are also becoming 
vulnerable due to their larger size and thin profile. 
My video 
above shows some broken mobile phones that were subjected to severe 
tests with a test machine and others were simply damaged with the bare 
hands (the iPhone 6!)
British comedian Jason Manford managed to destroy his mini iPad with his seat!




This is the link to the most famous test on the iPhone 6 by 'Unbox 
Therapy'. It has had an amazing 62.6 million hits and the presenter is 
not even a pop star!

DESIGN
It
is nice to have an enclosure made of plastic, leather, fabric or
rubber for the basic mechanical protection against damage and also
for reasons of aesthetics and comfort in use by having a tactile
material. I chose plastic as one can mould in several features for
the functions I want my protective case to have. However, these
materials cannot provide much protection against bending or pressure
unless they are rather thick and we do not want to end up with a
chunky enclosure for a nice and slim device.

The
only other solution is to use a very rigid material, such as steel,
to provide the rigidity that is needed in the case to protect the
mobile device against bending. Attempts have been made to make metal
enclosures for mobile phones. However, they have a problem: the
manufacturers of these mobile devices do not like metal, carbon fibre
or magnets in the proximity of their devices as they can cause
interference to their radio signals and their sensors such as
magnetic compass, proximity sensor and gyroscope. 


My
solution is to add a reinforcing element to the soft case, made of
steel and inserted in the plastic body of the case. However, this
element must not add considerable weight to the case, it must not
make the case too chunky and it must not be close to the mobile
device when it is in use. I designed a metal component based on my
calculations of maximum strength with the minimum of material used
and this is the resulting shape: it adds aesthetic value to the case
too. But this is not all: I have designed it in such a way that the
metal part is close the the mobile phone when not it use and stored
such as in a trouser rear pocket. However, when the case is opened
for use, the metal part is moved away from the device so that it will
not cause interference.Early test pieces to determine the size 
and number of steel members that will provide the maximum reinforcement 
with the minimum of weight and thickness.

 PRESENT STATUS
So
where am I now? I am making these cases on a small scale by 3D
printing, this is limiting in the numbers I can produce and the price
of the products is high so I need to take it to the real production
methods that will allow me to make a quality product at an affordable
price and in large quantities. These production methods are injection moulded plastic and metal.
PATENT
I
have applied for a patent for this product and its inventiveness is
protected. Britsh Patent application number: GB1423232.6
And I own the copyright to the product image.




YOUR MONEY PLEDGE - WHY I NEED YOUR SUPPORT
Your kind
contributions will be used for adapting the design for production, to
manufacture the injection moulding tools for plastic and to order the
first production units for sale. I have already invested a considerable 
number of man hours and in the making of the prototoypes and testing 
getting the product to its present stage of development.
I have 
already started putting together a marketing plan that includes the 
product price and substantial promotion, primarily through the Internet.
 I intend to sell the product through my company and grow the product 
line.
Of
course this is not going to be the only product. I will continue to
make new versions for other mobile devices, including the iPads,
Kindles and the like. 


Please

the market for all of you to enjoy.
MY BACKGROUND

Take a second to see beyond the natural, healthy effects of these perfumes and appreciate the employment opportunities this creates around the world!</p><p>The Rising Phoenix Perfumery is known for its naturally-minded products <strong>made without harmful chemicals</strong> such, as <strong>parabens</strong> and <strong>phthalates</strong>. In a bid to provide local artisans a chance to preserve an ancient and dying art, its Attar line is world renowned. Combining conservation with culture, Rising Phoenix is now poised for another critical step in its journey, with the development of alcohol-based spray Eau De Parfum (EdP) fragrance line. While there is massive demand for its products, and production and distribution channels are in place, a final capital push is needed in the form of <strong>US$350,000</strong>. Help Rising Phoenix soar in its crowdfunding efforts and support this family based enterprise that believes in business ethics and preserving the unique heritage of natural fragrance.<br/> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>About The Rising Phoenix Perfumery</strong></p><p> </p><p>Hello! My name is JK DeLapp, founder and perfumer of The Rising Phoenix Perfumery, based in Atlanta, Georgia.</p><p>If you don’t know us, Rising Phoenix is a 100% family-owned artisanal perfumery based out of Atlanta, Georgia. Although we’re a small outfit, we’ve won acclaim from leading perfume critics, including the famed Luca Turin, for our perfumes, one of which was nominated for the Independent Perfume award of the 2016 Art and Olfaction Awards.</p><p>We do things differently from the big perfume corporations – every perfume we make is painstakingly made by hand using natural, rare raw materials, many of which we distill or produce ourselves, such as precious Oud oils from the Far East, Sandalwood oil from India, Indonesia, and Timor Island, and Frankincense Oils from Oman, Ethiopia and Somalia. Our fragrances are naturally minded and we have done our best to eliminate unnecessary chemicals that produce a toxic burden - both on the individual and on the planet.</p><p><u><strong>What have we eliminated, you might ask??</strong></u></p><ul>
<li>Parabens</li>
<li>Sulfates</li>
<li>Phthalates</li>
<li>Silicone</li>
<li>PG, DPG, and DOP</li>
<li>Triclosan</li>
<li>Nitro Musks</li>
</ul><p><strong><u>Why is eliminating these chemicals from fragrances important?</u></strong></p><p>Several synthetic ingredients such as nitro musks (banned in the industry already), phthalates and some fixatives can cause headaches, which is why I chose not to use these materials in my fragrances.</p><p>Many of us have begun to worry about the cumulative effect of these chemicals on our health and on our environment - so many have begun to try to limit their exposure to them. Research indicates that phthalates are a type of endocrine disruptor, and in the past few years, studies have linked these plasticizers to asthma, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, breast cancer, obesity and type II diabetes, neurodevelopmental issues, autism spectrum disorders, altered reproductive development and male fertility issues. Parabens, which are commonly used as preservatives, are also known to interfere with hormone production.</p><p>As a medical practitioner...this is very meaningful. The list of problems above sounds like a good deal of the people walking into my clinic.</p><p><u><strong>So how does Rising Phoenix go about doing things differently?</strong></u></p><p>Now, when I say “we”, let me be clear: I’m talking about the team of artisan distillers across South East Asia, Africa, and the USA that I have put together over the past 6 years.</p><p>Rising Phoenix is a family business, and we do our best to keep the work we do “in the family”. Granted, not every material Rising Phoenix uses is produced in house – but we do our best to keep our supply chain personal and use it as a way to employ countless people who need the work and support, and do our best to support local movements around the globe moving towards total sustainability.</p><p>My father and grandfather have worked in the corporate world for many years, and I am lucky to be able to draw on their enormous banks of experience. Their work has touched the lives of countless people across the globe, and I’ve taken it upon myself to continue the family tradition of ingenuity and excellence.</p><p>Me, I come to perfume by way of Chinese Medicine: I am actually a licensed physician in Chinese Medicine, and I still treat patients through the week. My time spent working in leading hospitals in China and studying the effects of herbs and botanicals on the human body gave me great respect for the natural raw materials in our world and their effect not only on the Body, but on the Spirit and Mind, too. Making naturally-minded fragrances is a natural extension of that, for me.</p><p>But I’ll tell you what the most important lesson my Dad taught me: he taught me the value of hard work. We are a family of bootstrappers. We are not wealthy people, but damn, we know about hard work. We might be cash-poor, but we’re knowledge-rich, and I know that counts for something in this day and age.</p><p>I need your help. <u>Yes, you, who’s reading this right now</u>.  By selling just <i>3,500 full bottles</i> of the new EDPs, I will reach my target and you will have helped officially launch RPP into the market!</p><p>The Rising Phoenix Perfumery is at a crossroads, and our next move is crucial. To date, we’ve been making small batches of Attars, which are concentrated, oil-based perfumes with no alcohol in them. These sell well, especially to connoisseurs of millennia-old Middle and Far Eastern perfumery, and there is a very quickly growing appreciation of them in the West.</p><p>But I need to scale up. It’s now or never. The business needs cash to make the crucial jump to larger-batch production, distribution, and selling. To this end, we’ve introduced a range of alcohol-based spray perfumes that carry all the luxury and prestige of the Attar line, just in a different, more saleable format. We want to sell these in markets where we know there’s huge demand, such as Russia and the Middle East. How do I know there’s demand? I have several hundred thousand in Purchase Orders already lined up, as well as partnerships with key distributors in the regions.</p><p>Only one piece of the puzzle is missing: the money. To break into these larger markets, I need tons more bottles, packaging, raw materials, labels, and so on. I will still make everything myself, by hand. But I lack the financial means to make this last leap.</p><p>Specifically, I need <u>$350,000</u> in order to bring my business to the next level.</p><p><strong>3500 FULL BOTTLE contributions would fully fund the project! I know that $350,000 sounds like a lot...but really, it's only 3500 full bottles! Totally feasible!</strong></p><p>YOU can be the missing part of the puzzle. Donate money, and not only do you get rewards in the form of damn fine fragrances, but you get to be in on the ground floor of this amazing investment into our future. We are a family of bootstrappers – but I’m reaching my hand up to you to make that last final push over the wall. Will you give me your hand?</p><p> </p><p><u><strong>Here’s where YOUR donation will go:</strong></u></p><p>·      Bottle-manufacturing and packaging: specifically, brand new bottles and packaging for the 2 product lines I have developed – the attar line and the Eau de Parfum (EdP) line. You will see a shot of the new EdP bottle design in the video above. The Attar bottles are currently being finalized.</p><p>·      Raw materials: In perfume terms, we call the contents of the bottle the “juice”. Since we focus on the high quality, natural raw materials, including costly distillates and absolutes that we produce ourselves in partnership with distillers and farmers in developing countries, the “juice” is the most expensive part!</p><p>·      Travel expenses: A small portion of the funds will go towards necessary travel expenses such as visiting on-site distillations and farming cooperatives in developing countries.</p><p> </p><p><u><strong>These are the results we anticipate thanks to YOUR donation:</strong></u></p><p>·      Rising Phoenix goes global: Your donation will ensure that Rising Phoenix is able to make the next step from small, family business to a business that distributes its products in global markets, thus multiplying local production and employment in our supplier countries.</p><p>·      Fulfillment of purchase orders: If I raise the money for the new bottles and packaging, this will enable me to fulfill the $500,000 in purchase orders I already have and move into global distribution channels.</p><p>·      Employment in low-income countries: Rising Phoenix pays a decent living wage to dozens of local famers and distillers in 20+ developing countries around the world, which in turns supports the family incomes and their workers, totaling hundreds of members in total. YOUR donation will help ensure that Rising Phoenix’s employment support to low-income families in developing countries not only continues but also grows exponentially with the business. </p><p><u><strong>The Impact of YOUR donation:</strong></u></p><p>Above, we listed all the results of YOUR donation – those are the numerable, quantifiable outputs that will come about as part of your generosity. But impact is different: impact is a broader set of outcomes that will continue to affect the “big picture” of the Rising Phoenix Perfumery and the people it supports around the globe. Impact is sometimes hard to quantify – you can’t measure it in numbers. So I’ll give it the old college try with words instead.</p><p>Suffice it to say, your contribution to Rising Phoenix will help countless people involved in creating the materials that go into Rising Phoenix products. Your support is helping to directly support our grass roots supply chain in over 20 countries! We’ve mentioned that already, but think about what that means for those workers a minute. It means being able to provide for their families and send their kids to school. It means they can survive without having to scrape by.</p><p>Additionally, once the Rising Phoenix commercial line is fully operational - I have license to several thousand acres across several countries in South East Asia that I plan to begin populating and growing our own biodynamic Agarwood and Sandalwood plantations - further supporting the local peoples I am partnered with, and adding to the sustainability and natural bio-diversity of species that have become endangered and over-harvested (some almost to the point of extinction). If I get to this point, I will be helping re-plant and re-forest decimated species and ravaged land. That is good for the planet, for the families that live off the land in those countries, and will eventually help decrease illegal harvesting elsewhere.</p><p><i>Now, how many fragrance companies do you know who are doing that!? </i></p><p>Probably the most unusual feat I will be able to accomplish with your support will be to kick into action a plan to custom distill attars in the traditional Indian manner with <i><u><strong>the oldest</strong></u></i> family distiller in India, a way of life that has been dying out in India over the last few decades thanks to mass-production. That would be a traditionally distilled line of Attars that I have designed. That is to come in the near future as a Stage 2, once we are fully operational. No one on the planet is doing perfumery like this!</p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Here are your rewards for donating to this campaign:</u></strong></p><p>·      <u>Heavily discounted perfume:</u> Take a look at the sidebar here – you will see a list of Eau de Parfums, attars, and sets, discounted at rates you will never find on a store shelf, <i><strong>and savings of up to $460</strong></i> on certain items. YOU get to choose which perfume you want and which level of investment you want to go in at.</p><p>·      <u>Exclusivity</u>: In return for YOUR donation, you will get access to certain perfumes even before they are released to the market. Grab your chance to be part of a panel that tests and evaluates early mods of a perfume before it hits the shelves, allowing you to possibly shape and guide the final product!</p><p>·      <u>The chance to sample <strong>rare</strong> raw materials</u>: Have you ever smelled real oud or sandalwood in its original wood or oil form? How about frankincense? Would you like to? We are offering you the rare opportunity to not only smell the finished perfumes but also to smell the precious raw materials that go into the perfumes. As far as we know, no other fragrance company allows for this option!</p><p><i>**Once the campaign wraps - I pull the trigger. This means that I'll be able to get to work on the samples immediately.</i></p><p><i>**For the full bottles - it will take the bottle manufacturers 2-3 months before I receive the initial newly manufactured bottles. I imagine it may take me up to a month to finalize assembly and begin shipping packages. You'll notice I put ""December 2017"" as the estimated delivery date. I hope to be able to have the items shipped and in your hands before that, but I'm putting December as a last expected ETA on delivery of your rewards.</i></p><p><u><strong>What’s already in place:</strong></u></p><p>Don’t worry – I am not asking for funding without having already done a lot of the hard work! I come from a family that believes in hard graft, remember? YOUR donation will help fill in the gaps I can’t fill by myself. But you will be investing in a structure that’s ready and just raring to go!</p><p>·      $500k in purchase orders lined up</p><p>·      $2m in advertizing lined up</p><p>·      Distributors in key foreign markets such as the USA, Russia and the Middle-East already lined up</p><p>·      EdP Bottle design, labeling, and packaging already completed – just need the money to order them!</p><p>·      The perfume formulae already in place and ready for production</p><p>·      Local distillation and supplier relationships on the ground in 20 countries in place</p><p>·      HUGE support from fragrance critics, bloggers, media, and fans for our work – Luca Turin has reviewed our fragrances favorably, as have many others. There is a bank of goodwill out there for us, and we are not about to squander it.</p><p>·      Media blitz for the product line launch already designed and ready for implementation</p><p> </p><p>All that is needed at this point is the remaining $350K in funding to pull the trigger and begin the manufacturing process. Your support will allow me to finalize everything I’ve been working towards over the past few years! <strong>THANK YOU</strong> in advance.</p><p><u><strong>My Track Record:</strong></u></p><p>I am an experienced perfumer and businessman. In 2016, I shipped thousands of packages of product into 35 countries - all compounded and bottled by hand, right here out of my home-based operation in Atlanta.</p><p>I am a do-it-yourself kind of guy, and I am not afraid of hard work. I love what I do, so I absolutely don’t mind being in the atelier bottling perfumes at 4am in the morning!</p><p>Hard work and talent brings rewards, though. My fragrance, Musk Rose Attar, was a finalist in the 2016 global Art and Olfaction Awards, selected from a pool of hundreds of different perfumes from firms all around the globe. </p><p>My perfume Phoenix Fougère was recently reviewed by famed perfume critic, <strong>Luca Turin</strong>, who went so far as to say that it is “…what could well be the best Fougère since Paul Parquet’s Fougère Royale, though more citrusy, less animalic and none the worse for it.” In other words – the best Fougere since the invention of Fougeres and the advent of Modern Perfumery!</p><p>Rising Phoenix has received rave reviews from dozens of top bloggers and review companies like <strong>Fragrantica</strong>, <strong>CaFleureBon</strong>, and <strong>Basenotes</strong>. A quick Google search of ""<i>JK DeLapp Rising Phoenix</i>"" will get you dozens of hits of reviews and interviews from a wide variety of publications and in several languages.</p><p>Rising Phoenix is currently the largest supplier of Agarwood, Oud, and Ambergris in North America. If you are a connoisseur of Artisan Oud or Artisan Sandalwood oils, then undoubtedly you are familiar with our custom-distilled line of premium Rising Phoenix Ouds and premium Mysore Sandalwood Oils.</p><p>I have ties in the fragrance community and consider myself an active, interested member! I have long-standing relationships with the <i>co-founder of Fragrantica</i>, <strong>Zoran Knezevic</strong> - whom I consider a good friend and Mentor - as well as with <i>CaFleureBon's Editor-in-Chief</i>, <strong>Michelin Camen</strong>, whom has been an invaluable resource of advice and feedback over the years.</p><p>I also owe a big (<i>BIG!</i>) thanks to <strong>Claire Vukcevic</strong> - <i>frequent contributor over at Basenotes</i> - for her invaluable input and help in polishing the written portion of this campaign.

Take a second to see beyond the natural, healthy effects of these perfumes and appreciate the employment opportunities this creates around the world!The Rising Phoenix Perfumery is known for its naturally-minded products made without harmful chemicals such, as parabens and phthalates. In a bid to provide local artisans a chance to preserve an ancient and dying art, its Attar line is world renowned. Combining conservation with culture, Rising Phoenix is now poised for another critical step in its journey, with the development of alcohol-based spray Eau De Parfum (EdP) fragrance line. While there is massive demand for its products, and production and distribution channels are in place, a final capital push is needed in the form of US$350,000. Help Rising Phoenix soar in its crowdfunding efforts and support this family based enterprise that believes in business ethics and preserving the unique heritage of natural fragrance. About The Rising Phoenix Perfumery Hello! My name is JK DeLapp, founder and perfumer of The Rising Phoenix Perfumery, based in Atlanta, Georgia.If you don’t know us, Rising Phoenix is a 100% family-owned artisanal perfumery based out of Atlanta, Georgia. Although we’re a small outfit, we’ve won acclaim from leading perfume critics, including the famed Luca Turin, for our perfumes, one of which was nominated for the Independent Perfume award of the 2016 Art and Olfaction Awards.We do things differently from the big perfume corporations – every perfume we make is painstakingly made by hand using natural, rare raw materials, many of which we distill or produce ourselves, such as precious Oud oils from the Far East, Sandalwood oil from India, Indonesia, and Timor Island, and Frankincense Oils from Oman, Ethiopia and Somalia. Our fragrances are naturally minded and we have done our best to eliminate unnecessary chemicals that produce a toxic burden - both on the individual and on the planet.What have we eliminated, you might ask??
Parabens
Sulfates
Phthalates
Silicone
PG, DPG, and DOP
Triclosan
Nitro Musks
Why is eliminating these chemicals from fragrances important?Several synthetic ingredients such as nitro musks (banned in the industry already), phthalates and some fixatives can cause headaches, which is why I chose not to use these materials in my fragrances.Many of us have begun to worry about the cumulative effect of these chemicals on our health and on our environment - so many have begun to try to limit their exposure to them. Research indicates that phthalates are a type of endocrine disruptor, and in the past few years, studies have linked these plasticizers to asthma, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, breast cancer, obesity and type II diabetes, neurodevelopmental issues, autism spectrum disorders, altered reproductive development and male fertility issues. Parabens, which are commonly used as preservatives, are also known to interfere with hormone production.As a medical practitioner...this is very meaningful. The list of problems above sounds like a good deal of the people walking into my clinic.So how does Rising Phoenix go about doing things differently?Now, when I say “we”, let me be clear: I’m talking about the team of artisan distillers across South East Asia, Africa, and the USA that I have put together over the past 6 years.Rising Phoenix is a family business, and we do our best to keep the work we do “in the family”. Granted, not every material Rising Phoenix uses is produced in house – but we do our best to keep our supply chain personal and use it as a way to employ countless people who need the work and support, and do our best to support local movements around the globe moving towards total sustainability.My father and grandfather have worked in the corporate world for many years, and I am lucky to be able to draw on their enormous banks of experience. Their work has touched the lives of countless people across the globe, and I’ve taken it upon myself to continue the family tradition of ingenuity and excellence.Me, I come to perfume by way of Chinese Medicine: I am actually a licensed physician in Chinese Medicine, and I still treat patients through the week. My time spent working in leading hospitals in China and studying the effects of herbs and botanicals on the human body gave me great respect for the natural raw materials in our world and their effect not only on the Body, but on the Spirit and Mind, too. Making naturally-minded fragrances is a natural extension of that, for me.But I’ll tell you what the most important lesson my Dad taught me: he taught me the value of hard work. We are a family of bootstrappers. We are not wealthy people, but damn, we know about hard work. We might be cash-poor, but we’re knowledge-rich, and I know that counts for something in this day and age.I need your help. Yes, you, who’s reading this right now.  By selling just 3,500 full bottles of the new EDPs, I will reach my target and you will have helped officially launch RPP into the market!The Rising Phoenix Perfumery is at a crossroads, and our next move is crucial. To date, we’ve been making small batches of Attars, which are concentrated, oil-based perfumes with no alcohol in them. These sell well, especially to connoisseurs of millennia-old Middle and Far Eastern perfumery, and there is a very quickly growing appreciation of them in the West.But I need to scale up. It’s now or never. The business needs cash to make the crucial jump to larger-batch production, distribution, and selling. To this end, we’ve introduced a range of alcohol-based spray perfumes that carry all the luxury and prestige of the Attar line, just in a different, more saleable format. We want to sell these in markets where we know there’s huge demand, such as Russia and the Middle East. How do I know there’s demand? I have several hundred thousand in Purchase Orders already lined up, as well as partnerships with key distributors in the regions.Only one piece of the puzzle is missing: the money. To break into these larger markets, I need tons more bottles, packaging, raw materials, labels, and so on. I will still make everything myself, by hand. But I lack the financial means to make this last leap.Specifically, I need $350,000 in order to bring my business to the next level.3500 FULL BOTTLE contributions would fully fund the project! I know that $350,000 sounds like a lot...but really, it's only 3500 full bottles! Totally feasible!YOU can be the missing part of the puzzle. Donate money, and not only do you get rewards in the form of damn fine fragrances, but you get to be in on the ground floor of this amazing investment into our future. We are a family of bootstrappers – but I’m reaching my hand up to you to make that last final push over the wall. Will you give me your hand? Here’s where YOUR donation will go:·      Bottle-manufacturing and packaging: specifically, brand new bottles and packaging for the 2 product lines I have developed – the attar line and the Eau de Parfum (EdP) line. You will see a shot of the new EdP bottle design in the video above. The Attar bottles are currently being finalized.·      Raw materials: In perfume terms, we call the contents of the bottle the “juice”. Since we focus on the high quality, natural raw materials, including costly distillates and absolutes that we produce ourselves in partnership with distillers and farmers in developing countries, the “juice” is the most expensive part!·      Travel expenses: A small portion of the funds will go towards necessary travel expenses such as visiting on-site distillations and farming cooperatives in developing countries. These are the results we anticipate thanks to YOUR donation:·      Rising Phoenix goes global: Your donation will ensure that Rising Phoenix is able to make the next step from small, family business to a business that distributes its products in global markets, thus multiplying local production and employment in our supplier countries.·      Fulfillment of purchase orders: If I raise the money for the new bottles and packaging, this will enable me to fulfill the $500,000 in purchase orders I already have and move into global distribution channels.·      Employment in low-income countries: Rising Phoenix pays a decent living wage to dozens of local famers and distillers in 20+ developing countries around the world, which in turns supports the family incomes and their workers, totaling hundreds of members in total. YOUR donation will help ensure that Rising Phoenix’s employment support to low-income families in developing countries not only continues but also grows exponentially with the business. The Impact of YOUR donation:Above, we listed all the results of YOUR donation – those are the numerable, quantifiable outputs that will come about as part of your generosity. But impact is different: impact is a broader set of outcomes that will continue to affect the “big picture” of the Rising Phoenix Perfumery and the people it supports around the globe. Impact is sometimes hard to quantify – you can’t measure it in numbers. So I’ll give it the old college try with words instead.Suffice it to say, your contribution to Rising Phoenix will help countless people involved in creating the materials that go into Rising Phoenix products. Your support is helping to directly support our grass roots supply chain in over 20 countries! We’ve mentioned that already, but think about what that means for those workers a minute. It means being able to provide for their families and send their kids to school. It means they can survive without having to scrape by.Additionally, once the Rising Phoenix commercial line is fully operational - I have license to several thousand acres across several countries in South East Asia that I plan to begin populating and growing our own biodynamic Agarwood and Sandalwood plantations - further supporting the local peoples I am partnered with, and adding to the sustainability and natural bio-diversity of species that have become endangered and over-harvested (some almost to the point of extinction). If I get to this point, I will be helping re-plant and re-forest decimated species and ravaged land. That is good for the planet, for the families that live off the land in those countries, and will eventually help decrease illegal harvesting elsewhere.Now, how many fragrance companies do you know who are doing that!? Probably the most unusual feat I will be able to accomplish with your support will be to kick into action a plan to custom distill attars in the traditional Indian manner with the oldest family distiller in India, a way of life that has been dying out in India over the last few decades thanks to mass-production. That would be a traditionally distilled line of Attars that I have designed. That is to come in the near future as a Stage 2, once we are fully operational. No one on the planet is doing perfumery like this! Here are your rewards for donating to this campaign:·      Heavily discounted perfume: Take a look at the sidebar here – you will see a list of Eau de Parfums, attars, and sets, discounted at rates you will never find on a store shelf, and savings of up to $460 on certain items. YOU get to choose which perfume you want and which level of investment you want to go in at.·      Exclusivity: In return for YOUR donation, you will get access to certain perfumes even before they are released to the market. Grab your chance to be part of a panel that tests and evaluates early mods of a perfume before it hits the shelves, allowing you to possibly shape and guide the final product!·      The chance to sample rare raw materials: Have you ever smelled real oud or sandalwood in its original wood or oil form? How about frankincense? Would you like to? We are offering you the rare opportunity to not only smell the finished perfumes but also to smell the precious raw materials that go into the perfumes. As far as we know, no other fragrance company allows for this option!**Once the campaign wraps - I pull the trigger. This means that I'll be able to get to work on the samples immediately.**For the full bottles - it will take the bottle manufacturers 2-3 months before I receive the initial newly manufactured bottles. I imagine it may take me up to a month to finalize assembly and begin shipping packages. You'll notice I put ""December 2017"" as the estimated delivery date. I hope to be able to have the items shipped and in your hands before that, but I'm putting December as a last expected ETA on delivery of your rewards.What’s already in place:Don’t worry – I am not asking for funding without having already done a lot of the hard work! I come from a family that believes in hard graft, remember? YOUR donation will help fill in the gaps I can’t fill by myself. But you will be investing in a structure that’s ready and just raring to go!·      $500k in purchase orders lined up·      $2m in advertizing lined up·      Distributors in key foreign markets such as the USA, Russia and the Middle-East already lined up·      EdP Bottle design, labeling, and packaging already completed – just need the money to order them!·      The perfume formulae already in place and ready for production·      Local distillation and supplier relationships on the ground in 20 countries in place·      HUGE support from fragrance critics, bloggers, media, and fans for our work – Luca Turin has reviewed our fragrances favorably, as have many others. There is a bank of goodwill out there for us, and we are not about to squander it.·      Media blitz for the product line launch already designed and ready for implementation All that is needed at this point is the remaining $350K in funding to pull the trigger and begin the manufacturing process. Your support will allow me to finalize everything I’ve been working towards over the past few years! THANK YOU in advance.My Track Record:I am an experienced perfumer and businessman. In 2016, I shipped thousands of packages of product into 35 countries - all compounded and bottled by hand, right here out of my home-based operation in Atlanta.I am a do-it-yourself kind of guy, and I am not afraid of hard work. I love what I do, so I absolutely don’t mind being in the atelier bottling perfumes at 4am in the morning!Hard work and talent brings rewards, though. My fragrance, Musk Rose Attar, was a finalist in the 2016 global Art and Olfaction Awards, selected from a pool of hundreds of different perfumes from firms all around the globe. My perfume Phoenix Fougère was recently reviewed by famed perfume critic, Luca Turin, who went so far as to say that it is “…what could well be the best Fougère since Paul Parquet’s Fougère Royale, though more citrusy, less animalic and none the worse for it.” In other words – the best Fougere since the invention of Fougeres and the advent of Modern Perfumery!Rising Phoenix has received rave reviews from dozens of top bloggers and review companies like Fragrantica, CaFleureBon, and Basenotes. A quick Google search of ""JK DeLapp Rising Phoenix"" will get you dozens of hits of reviews and interviews from a wide variety of publications and in several languages.Rising Phoenix is currently the largest supplier of Agarwood, Oud, and Ambergris in North America. If you are a connoisseur of Artisan Oud or Artisan Sandalwood oils, then undoubtedly you are familiar with our custom-distilled line of premium Rising Phoenix Ouds and premium Mysore Sandalwood Oils.I have ties in the fragrance community and consider myself an active, interested member! I have long-standing relationships with the co-founder of Fragrantica, Zoran Knezevic - whom I consider a good friend and Mentor - as well as with CaFleureBon's Editor-in-Chief, Michelin Camen, whom has been an invaluable resource of advice and feedback over the years.I also owe a big (BIG!) thanks to Claire Vukcevic - frequent contributor over at Basenotes - for her invaluable input and help in polishing the written portion of this campaign. Without Claire, I don't know how I would have put all the writing together!I was also featured in the documentary Ancient Secrets: Essential Oils Movie:https://www.essentialoilsmovie.com/about/cast/I love to share my knowledge with others. I created and now offer 2 very successful online perfumery courses with thousands of students in over 30 countries, through a partner company, Floracopeia: http://www.floracopeia.com/searchresults/?keywo...One of the distillers with whom I work actually started out as a student of mine and has grown to be one of the most successful distillation and cosmetic operations in Armenia. I have developed an all-natural cosmetics line that I hope to launch in the year following the commercial launch, made exclusively from materials we plan to extract together. If you’d like to check out this company and former student of mine, please visit: www.nairian.amAs you can see...I've been hard at work the past few years, and I need your help to take this last big leap and put my products into the hands of everyone! Other Ways You Can Help! I know some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help!I would GREATLY appreciate your help in spreading the word about the work that I am doing, and my campaign to raise the funds that I need to accomplish the next phase of manufacturing!Your support will help me to manifest my dream of a retail ready line, and will go further to help support countless people around the world who are involved in the work that I do to create these marvelous fragrances!Don't forget to use the Indiegogo share tools to help me spread the word to your friends and family, and I'd appreciate your encouraging them to support my work.Thank you so much for taking the time to read about my work - and I look forward to helping you smell fabulous!~JK DeLappFounder, The Rising Phoenix PerfumeryAtlanta, Georgia - USA   What do the fragrances smell like?**I will be posting an upcoming review of the fragrances as soon as it hits the press in a few days!

</div></div>","I'm Danny, my passion is watches, especially mechanical watches. Famous brand name watches are produced in Switzerland but they are extremely expensive and unaffordable for most people.  Because of this, I gathered knowledge in Switzerland and learned the skills required to create precise and high quality watches that could  be personalized for each client.  A special and one-of-a-kind timepiece personalized with a special message on the rotor.  Today, I start this campaign and request contributors to support my project to bring everyone high quality and precise personalized watches at reasonable prices.

Le projet est né d'une idée très simple: une montre ne doit pas être seulement un objet qui indique l'heure. Pour un homme, c'est aussi un accessoire de luxe qui reflète son goût et sa personnalité, un bijou à afficher. Quel est le sens de ces montres connectées à écran LED qui fleurissent aujourd'hui, sur lesquelles l'utilisateur doit bouger son bras pour obtenir l'heure, et qui plus est conçu par des gens qui n'ont pas encore compris qu'un écran noir est très loin de l'esthétique.Nous avons donc créé la première montre hybride premium: c'est une vraie montre, avec son propre cœur qui bat, un vrai écran et de vraies aiguilles au lieu d'un écran LED si laid que nous rencontrons sur Smartwatches. Et cette montre donne bien plus que l'heure: un appel, un message, l'emplacement de votre smartphone et bien plus encore.

What can you do with a FOXTER Exalt:  

 


 
 The project began with a very simple idea: a watch should not just be an object which tells the time. For a man, it is also an luxury accessory reflecting taste and personality, an item of jewellery to be displayed. What does this mean for those LED screen connected watches that flourish today, on which the user have to shake the arm to get the time, designed by people who have yet to understand that a black screen far from aesthetic.

 
 So we have created the first premium hybrid watch: This is a real watch, with its own beating heart, a real screen and real hands instead of ugly LED screen we are encountering on Smartwatches. This timepiece is designed by a genuine watch-maker from the famous ""place Vendome"".But this watch can tell more than just the time: A call, a message, the location of your smartphone and much more.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>Going with the Flow</strong></u></h3>
<p>Fascin8 Flow Wear is a brand inspired by the concepts of synchronicity and flow. Sometimes referred to in positive psychology as ""being in the zone"", <i>flow</i> is characterized as the mental state of full immersion, focus, and (most importantly) enjoyment of life. Flow is the achievement of a blissful state of being, punctuated by the feeling of <u>effortlessness</u>. <i>Take a close look at our logo and you may find a few hints at these concepts incorporated into the design.</i></p>
</div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499391498/udx5rrqqnmwvqkgaceuu.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>Flow = Comfort</strong></u></h2>
<p>At Fascin8, we believe a key component of flow is comfort. When we are comfortable and unencumbered by restrictive apparel, everything else seems to simply fall into place. There's something irresistible about the super soft T-shirt you find yourself reaching for every time you open the drawer. By using the softest, lightest and most luxurious fabrics, we give our customers a unique wearing experience unparalleled by any other clothing brands. We're on a mission to become your favorite T-shirt!</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499396545/qtslzkuagdicwzi3vrnv.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">
<strong><u>Flow = Sus</u></strong><strong><u>tainability</u></strong>
</h3>
<p>Of course, all of the comfort in the world is meaningless if the manufacturing process required to achieve it wreaks havoc on the environment. With this in mind, we felt it equally important to ensure our clothing is made using the most sustainable fabrics and manufacturing techniques available. </p>
<p>The four fabric types we currently incorporate into our product line include certified organic cotton, naturally organic hemp, and bamboo as well as RPET Polyesters. The first three are sustainable organics that minimize water consumption and avoid the use of harsh pesticides and fertilizers in their cultivation. The fourth is a synthetic polyester which is actually sourced by recycling discarded plastic bottles thereby diverting waste plastics from oceans and landfills.</p>

</div></div>","Going with the Flow
Fascin8 Flow Wear is a brand inspired by the concepts of synchronicity and flow. Sometimes referred to in positive psychology as ""being in the zone"", flow is characterized as the mental state of full immersion, focus, and (most importantly) enjoyment of life. Flow is the achievement of a blissful state of being, punctuated by the feeling of effortlessness. Take a close look at our logo and you may find a few hints at these concepts incorporated into the design.


Flow = Comfort
At Fascin8, we believe a key component of flow is comfort. When we are comfortable and unencumbered by restrictive apparel, everything else seems to simply fall into place. There's something irresistible about the super soft T-shirt you find yourself reaching for every time you open the drawer. By using the softest, lightest and most luxurious fabrics, we give our customers a unique wearing experience unparalleled by any other clothing brands. We're on a mission to become your favorite T-shirt!


Flow = Sustainability

Of course, all of the comfort in the world is meaningless if the manufacturing process required to achieve it wreaks havoc on the environment. With this in mind, we felt it equally important to ensure our clothing is made using the most sustainable fabrics and manufacturing techniques available. 
The four fabric types we currently incorporate into our product line include certified organic cotton, naturally organic hemp, and bamboo as well as RPET Polyesters. The first three are sustainable organics that minimize water consumption and avoid the use of harsh pesticides and fertilizers in their cultivation. The fourth is a synthetic polyester which is actually sourced by recycling discarded plastic bottles thereby diverting waste plastics from oceans and landfills.
We only use low impact, fiber reactive dyes that are not harmful to the environment. This means our dyes do not contain any heavy metals or toxic substances. Recycled water is used in the dye facilities as well to minimize the amount of fresh water needed when compared with all other dye processes in the industry.

<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">Hi, thank you so much for your interest in our campaign. My name is Heather Bling and I am the founder of TheBlingClub.com. I started the company in 2015. Our goal has always been to bring beautiful, high quality jewelry to the public at great prices. From day one, all of our jewelry has been snag free. This means that it won’t catch on your clothing or hair. I personally “road test” every piece to make sure! There’s nothing worse than ruining an outfit by snagging your jewelry on it. You never need to worry about that with products from TheBlingClub.com.</p>

Our company has doubled it’s sales year over year since 2015 however we are at a crossroads when it comes to funding. We will continue to grow no matter what, but we really need $5,000 to launch us to the next level so we can continue to double or even triple our sales this year. I have personally bootstrapped the business until now but it’s time to ask for your help.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">Getting the funding of $5,000 will mean the world to us! It will not only allow us to grow, but also will allow us to start hiring people and employ American workers.

<p>The super-absorbent qualities of disposable diapers are not really the blessing they seem to be. Super-absorbent disposables can do three things,</p>

<p>2:  Reduce air circulation and pull natural moisture (not just urine) out of your baby’s skin—which can cause irritation.</p>

<h3>Why am I here? </h3>
<p>Please take some time to retrace my journey with me. </p>
<ul>
<li>In 2006 I was 24 and preparing for a trip to Miami and like every other traveler I wanted to make sure my body was ready for the beach. I made the life changing decision to get on a scale for the first time since high school. I found out that I was 5'4 and 225lbs. I was flabbergasted. I decided at that moment to change my life. 11 months later I lost 65lbs and felt great. Since then I have explored many meal planning ideas and fitness models. I settled and fell in love with one Crossfit and have been a dedicated Crossfit athlete since 2010. My brand was born out of the Crossfit movement.</li>
<li>This brand is extremely important to me because it reflects everything I love and hate about living a fit and healthy lifestyle. It reflects bravado and moments you feel great. It also reflects down times and challenges that come with a fit life.  I'm passionate about building a brand that is durable, confident, transcending and engaging.</li>
<li>The contributors will help me do a great deal. My goal in 2017 is to attend a total of 10 Crossfit events in the Maryland, DC, Virginia, Delaware, New York and Pennsylvania areas. I intend to get booths and exercise old school gorilla marketing techniques to grow my brand through word of mouth. The funds will help me buy the inventory necessary and booth costs for the various events I plan to attend. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>

</div></div>","Why am I here? 
Please take some time to retrace my journey with me. 

In 2006 I was 24 and preparing for a trip to Miami and like every other traveler I wanted to make sure my body was ready for the beach. I made the life changing decision to get on a scale for the first time since high school. I found out that I was 5'4 and 225lbs. I was flabbergasted. I decided at that moment to change my life. 11 months later I lost 65lbs and felt great. Since then I have explored many meal planning ideas and fitness models. I settled and fell in love with one Crossfit and have been a dedicated Crossfit athlete since 2010. My brand was born out of the Crossfit movement.
This brand is extremely important to me because it reflects everything I love and hate about living a fit and healthy lifestyle. It reflects bravado and moments you feel great. It also reflects down times and challenges that come with a fit life.  I'm passionate about building a brand that is durable, confident, transcending and engaging.
The contributors will help me do a great deal. My goal in 2017 is to attend a total of 10 Crossfit events in the Maryland, DC, Virginia, Delaware, New York and Pennsylvania areas. I intend to get booths and exercise old school gorilla marketing techniques to grow my brand through word of mouth. The funds will help me buy the inventory necessary and booth costs for the various events I plan to attend. 


What We Need & What You Get

We are in a need of $25,000 to help fund the inventory. We already have a supplier and have invested over $10,000 in mock and real products from 4 different vendors to determine who is the best. We only use the top of the line material and don't cut corners in quality.Tell people about your unique perks. Get them excited!
Our goal is to sell 12,000 shirts in 2017. Our profit margin is between $4.00 and $7.00 per sale depending on the size and type of shirt. 
Funds will be in our business account and will be tracked by our 3rd party bookkeeper. All funds are for business use and will not be transferred or shared with our personal bank accounts. We both have good careers in sales making over $90,000 per year with minimal debts.


Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know the difference their contribution will make:

The fitness industry is continuing to grow as it currently sits at 186 billion. Crossfit related products are approx a 4 Billion dollar industgry.

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>My name is Caryn Stewart. I have a 19-year-old daughter, a 22-year-old-son and before I owned Heelarious, I made a living in online sales and e-commerce. I combined my passion for being a mom and my business experience to create an online children’s boutique store. I could not keep Heelarious shoes in my inventory and absolutely loved the product. Through my vendor relationship with Britta, she offered for me to adopt her baby, Heelarious. I invested most of my savings, dove into my dream and bought Heelarious. As a new business owner, I was saddened when someone in the US infringed on the patent before I could even get off the ground. To my detriment, I invested the last bit of savings that I had trying to stop them. I won the long, drawn out case, but I lost everything. I've spent that last two years educating myself, learning from the right mentors and partnered with someone just as passionate about entrepreneurship, family values, and the community.</p>
<p>My campaign is important to me because it really is what I entitled it.  This campaign is a restitution of my dream. The infringing company has to shut its doors down this year and I rightfully own this patent, which has 9 years remaining on it. As the rightful owner, I can build the brand! This idea was stolen because it is great. I still believe in it. My former clients, friends, and family have all encouraged me to return to my passion. I love the product, babies, and the industry. Best of all we are almost across the finish line and are currently debt free. It's just the two of us doing everything including the website.</p>
<p>For lack of ownership and legal knowledge, I lost everything but I believe that we all deserve second chances. I want to help my family, I want my dream back that I worked so very hard for. This product makes people smile which I love. I also miss being able to financially assist great causes, which proceeds of our profit will go towards. My friend and business partner will be right there with me.</p>
<p>Through my mentorship, self-reflection, learning and partnership, my faith in humanity has long been restored. All of you wonderful investors would be helping me restore my livelihood as well as giving me the opportunity to regain my dream and work passionately towards providing quality products that make people smile.  </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>I need $50,000.00 to begin manufacturing small batches, package my product and run a marketing campaign.</p>
<p>$30,000.00 will go towards manufacturing 3 of the 5 styles of shoes, $15,000.00 will pay for packaging storage and shipping costs and $5,000.00 will go towards marketing.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>$30,000.00 will go towards manufacturing, $15,000.00 will pay for packaging storage and shipping costs and $5,000.00 will go towards marketing.</p>
<p>Other than running our business with the highest standards and giving back to our community, I will never really be able to thank you for restoring Heelarious to its former glory as well as giving me back my dream. However, in an effort to do so the first thing that we will do is add a <strong>""Thank You""</strong> page to our website with each of your names and a thankful video from us as a long-standing thank you of how we got back on our feet and how you changed our lives. Next, once we become profitable, we will place<strong> 3%</strong> of our quarterly profits towards other <strong>Indiegogo</strong> campaigns, marking those contributions on the thank you page as a “pay it forward” tribute that your generosity has continued. Finally, we will also send <strong>a pair</strong> of one of the first <strong>Heelarious </strong>shoes to the <strong>20 highes</strong>t contributions to the campaign. There are other perks for investors as well.<strong> No contribution is too small!</strong></p>
<p>If we do not reach our entire goal, Heelarious will either pursue an “In Demand” option to continue fund-raising with Indiegogo or begin manufacturing with only one style of the shoes or two style small batch orders.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Our project is valuable because it makes a statement. Individuals that think it is ok to infringe on intellectual property and wipe out small businesses will learn that there is a community that cares and that people will not only stand for small businesses with merit but also stand against small business without. For a long time after my loss, I felt defeated for not knowing that the wiser thing to do was to have continued to produce the shoes and move forward. I ran a great and honest business and this is my opportunity to redeem myself and regain that dream that I let someone take from me. It will also put me in a position where I can be of help to others in the future. Not only is it a passion of mine to help others but my business partner is a passionate Human Rights activist and is always helping others in any way that he can. I’m a perfect example. This opportunity will only help him increase his efforts. Finally, I have to say that I have never seen someone not smile when they are introduced to the shoes. Heelarious shoes really are hilarious!</p>
<p>As contributors,<strong> long after you donate</strong>, whether you log into our site or not, you will know that you restored a livelihood, a sense of standard, created jobs and inspired many. <strong>Your donation today will be our donations tomorrow.</strong></p>
<p>My name is <strong>Caryn Stewart</strong> and my partner’s name is <strong>Ray Caban</strong>. It may take us a few days but please feel free to contact us at any time for updates, advice on our process, a tour of our garage for now but office…when we can afford one or just to say hello. We will be posting updates and videos on our site. We plan to visit orphanages, hospitals and deserving homes eliciting smiles by personally donating Heelarious shoes. After all, new-born baby girls are also society’s daughters.</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Heelarious has an approved patent for another 9 years. We have come up with ways to improve on it at that time. As a result, we do not fear legal competition. In the meantime, we fear unethical individuals that think it’s ok to ruin small businesses. However, in the words of <i>Donna Walsh</i>, creator of a Jewelry Scroll product featured on HSN and QVC whom was so gracious to offer us advice,<i> “People are going to copy you and you should not worry about it! You know what that really means, it means that you have a great idea!”</i></p>
<p>Now I know that because I own the patent and because the creator is on our side and will always advocate for Heelarious, we must not worry about people infringing. We must build the brand that is rightfully ours and recognized by past customers. We must provide a quality product for our future customers for years to come at a great price and only take steps within reason that do not jeopardize the company.</p>
<p> <strong>No contribution is too small!</strong> <strong>Even if you can’t contribute financially</strong>, <strong>there is no better advertisement than through word of mouth. Please promote our campaign in your social networks. Indiegogo has many share tools that help facilitate the campaigning experience. Thank you!</strong></p>

So far through history the two haven’t been friends. I decided to take a stand against this, and for the last few years I’ve been working on my brand Carley Rose The Label, an ethically minded, sustainability driven brand that creates gorgeous, comfortable and wearable designs. At least, that’s my dream.</p><p> </p><h3>The ASTERIA Bag is Born!</h3><p>The ASTERIA bags bring together my two passions. The ASTERIA bag LIGHTS UP and will have you become the centre of attention! Perhaps more importantly, they are also a more sustainable, ethical style option. Each bag is made from BRENTANO’s range of eco-fabrics faux-leathers on the outer, reclaimed textile lining, an ethically hand-beaded design on the front and incorporate brand new e-textile the LED Ribbon from 360Fashion Network, making these bags totally ONE OF A KIND.<br/> </p><h3>The ASTERIA bag is:</h3><ul>
<li>Vegan friendly</li>
<li>Made from eco friendly and recycled materials</li>
<li>Ethically made</li>
<li>High quality</li>
<li>Fashion Tech- Literally light up the room!</li>

</ul><h3>Not Just a Bag</h3><p>My dream of launching an ethical, sustainable label is why this campaign is so important to me. To launch such a brand requires a fair bit of capital as you can imagine. By preordering an ASTERIA clutch bag you would not only be contributing to the campaign and receiving an awesome product, you will also become  an inaugural part of something truly amazing. Imagine being involved in the first steps of a massive, world-changing movement towards sustainable fashion… That could be you!</p><p> </p><h3>Why do we need funding?</h3><p>The funds raised via profits from the ASTERIA bags and any other pledges will go back into the business to produce an ethical, sustainable clothing collection to launch at Mercedes Benz Fashion Week Australia in 2017. Starting a brand and launching it like this costs around $30,000. This is why I need YOU guys! It's hard to take a stand like this when it is so easy for most companies to take the easy road and contribute slave labor, child labor, and unsustainable resources and methods. With your pledge, you can help fix the future of fashion!</p><p> </p><h3>What Are the Risks?</h3><p>This particular campaign will fulfil all preorders regardless of total funding fulfilment. We have the capacity to do so. The extra funding will of course go towards expanding the brand as mentioned. You will receive your gorgeous, ethically made ASTERIA clutch (and/or matching coin purse) and you will love it! You can have peace of mind knowing that you will receive the product you pay for. </p><p> </p><h3>What Are The Challenges?</h3><p>As these bags incorporate a brand new technology, the LED from 360Fashion Network, there is of course a testing faze for the product. Challenges included making sure the LED Ribbon remained functional after a lot of wear as well as figuring out the best way to attach it to the bags. We are still testing to make sure the bags are as durable as possible and we promise to supply a high-quality product in the end. </p><p>Other challenges include sourcing factories that treat their employees ethically and sourcing sustainable fabrics and materials. We have been working hard on these in particular and are pleased to say we have made a lot of progress over the last few months including sourcing an eco-faux leather from Brentano. We will keep you updated as we progress!</p><p> </p><h3>The Perks!</h3><p>We are offering 5 perk tiers including:</p><ul>
<li>$25: Thank you mention.<br/>This is for those of you who just want to contribute and get a little bit of recognition. Your contribution is SO appreciated!<br/> </li>
<li>$50: Coin Purse<br/>Want to offer a little more? We think you should be rewarded. You will be sent a coin purse made from the same eco-fabrics as the ASTERIA bags, but this does incur a shipping fee. Don’t want the purse? Just enter the amount you want to contribute in the custom pledge box.<br/> </li>
<li>$220: One ASTERIA clutch bag<br/>This is our main perk. You will be preordering one of the amazing ASTERIA bags!! YAY! Choosing this perk while the campaign runs means you get $40 of the RRP of $260 which will go up once the campaign has ended.<br/> </li>
<li>$500: Design your own ASTERIA <br/>OMG! Do you have a colour combination or beaded design you want to see on the ASTERIA clutches? Choose this perk if you want to see it come to life! We will personally work together to make your idea a reality, plus free shipping! Your design might even be taken to production!<br/> </li>
<li>$1000: Become a sponsor<br/>Promote your own business while supporting an up-and-coming one. Read perk for all inclusions. We appreciate your sponsorship! This would make a huge difference!</li>
</ul><p> </p><p>On top of this, feel free to type your own custom pledge after clicking 'back it'. All pledgers from the duration of the campaign will be thanked on either social media, our website or both. Here’s some thanks in advance: THANK YOU!! SO MUCH!!</p><p> </p><h3>How Else Can You Help?</h3><p>You can help by simply sharing on social media. Whether or not you would like to buy a bag or make a pledge, a share can mean just as much and will be very much appreciated.

<p><strong>Who is Stray Cat Strut?</strong></p>
<p>Stray Cat Strut is a partnership composed of three female Atlanta-based designers and makers—Alicia Kot, Emmie Thompson, and Drew Atkinson.</p>
<p>We came from all across the US and somehow (<i>THANK YOU UNIVERSE</i>) made it into each other’s lives.</p>
<p>Emmie and Alicia are costume and clothing makers and designers and Drew specializes in makeup application and special effects prosthetic fabrication. Together they can create the perfect look for your needs, no matter how big (<i>we’re thinking Hagrid… or maybe a giant Cyclops??) </i>or small (<i>what about a 1920s flapper party look?).</i></p>
<p>Not only do we offer custom-designed looks for consumers, we are also a space for artist to connect, learn, and grow from each other. Through workshops and classes held in our studio, we welcome all creators and inspirers from all walks of life and all levels of their craft to come and join our family of “strays.” (<i>Think about it like you are the cat who showed up on the crazy cat lady’s doorstep and are carried into this house filled with other, different, unique, and inspiring cats and you’re just like “How did I get so lucky?! I just showed up because I heard there was free food!”)</i></p>
<p>We have worked and lived in this community long enough to understand the need for this type of partnership to take place. Atlanta is a major production hub and has a vast, professional theatre scene. With that comes a need for hard workers who can not only get the job done, but also inspire others and each other in the process. (<i>Honestly, we are doing this together because we can hold each other accountable and we love each other enough to want every member of our team to grow individually as well as in our super exciting partnership.)</i></p>
<p>Our job is making sure others are happy. In order to do that, we need to start off with the ability to make that happiness happen! As a contributor, you will provide the footing for us to get these projects up and running and we will do the rest. With a distinct effort to put everything we've got into all projects that are thrown our way, our mission is to design looks that inspire and connect creators to spread the power of curiosity!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Our dream goal is $30,000. This is enough funding to carrying us well into our first year of business.</p>
<p>We will use these contributions to design the welcoming work studio that we need to create our goods. We will use contributions on marketing materials, and all the small details that help create our brand, and we will use these contributions on tactile materials that we will use every day.</p>

<p>Reppit is an online rental service for sports jerseys, starting with football, that will span across the United States. We plan to perfect our logistics and process in our test run with football, and expand to baseball, hockey, basketball, and beyond.</p>
<p>The story of Reppit actually began at a Patriots-Jets game a few years ago that I attended with my father. My father is a long-time Jets fan, but is lucky to be able to make it to one game a season. He was sporting a Jets' Brett Favre jersey, which at the time of the game was more than a few of seasons out-of-date. When I asked him why he was wearing it, he told me that he had spent a lot of money on it, he had wanted to wear something relevant to the game, and he didn't want to buy a new jersey for fear of the same remorse he felt with the Favre jersey. No fan should end up with buyer's remorse, nor should they feel like they have to wear an outdated jersey to fit in with the crowd. Reppit will be the option that saves fans from these pitfalls and makes sure that everyone can ""rep"" their favorite players every time.</p>
<p>Through 2 comprehensive online consumer surveys, an historical attendance analysis, and a thorough analysis of our projected margins, there is definitely a market for Reppit to help sports fans everywhere feel like their part of the team. More than 17 million people attend professional football games in the United States each year, and our surveys have shown that our interested market can include 40% or more of those fans. To let that sink in again, that 6.8MM potential users per year is only accounting for fans attending professional football games. This Indiegogo can prove that jersey rental is the future for fans of all sports, and Reppit is excited to be that future.</p>
<p>The funding goal that we have set out to achieve with this Indiegogo is going to help us purchase a portion of our jersey inventory for our reward offers. The crux of our appeal is having a diverse range of jerseys to give our fans the choices that they want. With this initial kickoff, we will be able to start building out our inventory into a more comprehensive and well-rounded closet of choices for Reppit users. We will also be using the funding to ship the aforementioned jerseys to you and clean them once they return to ensure that our inventory can be rented to future fans as if they were brand new. Finally, this funding will be used to help promote the Reppit brand and product to help make sure that we will be able to continue bringing fans high-quality jersey rentals into 2018 and beyond!</p>

<p><strong>How this works: </strong>Commit to purchase your sneakers now and you will receive an order form for size/style shortly after the campaign ends.  We will then go into production and your custom made shoes will be delivered to your door late October. Available in most sizes (scroll down to see the chart).  We PROMISE you will receive your sneakers (if for some freakish reason you don't, you will receive a full refund)...and we will send updates at the timeline unfolds including a tracking number when they are shipped.</p>

<p>The ultimate goal was to make a beautiful, unique, comfortable and most importantly, cruelty free sneaker, without using any animal products. Most shoes are fixed with glues containing animal ingredients like gelatin and are made by boiling connective tissue and bone.  These shoes are 100% vegan and come in high tops, low tops and slip ons that kick ass anywhere, anytime. </p>
<p>Each sneaker is carefully curated from the extensive collection of fine art Kelli Bickman has created over the last decade.  More on Bickman's work here: <a href=""http://www.kellibickman.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.kellibickman.net</a></p>

and everyone needs to own a lot of them."" 
Joan Schweighardt, Shoe Retailing Today
 
How this works: Commit to purchase your sneakers now and you will receive an order form for size/style shortly after the campaign ends.  We will then go into production and your custom made shoes will be delivered to your door late October. Available in most sizes (scroll down to see the chart).  We PROMISE you will receive your sneakers (if for some freakish reason you don't, you will receive a full refund)...and we will send updates at the timeline unfolds including a tracking number when they are shipped.

The ultimate goal was to make a beautiful, unique, comfortable and most importantly, cruelty free sneaker, without using any animal products. Most shoes are fixed with glues containing animal ingredients like gelatin and are made by boiling connective tissue and bone.  These shoes are 100% vegan and come in high tops, low tops and slip ons that kick ass anywhere, anytime. 
Each sneaker is carefully curated from the extensive collection of fine art Kelli Bickman has created over the last decade.  More on Bickman's work here: www.kellibickman.net
Choose from 10 designs:




 




 

                                             


BONUS: TWO FREE PAIR OF COLORED LACES INCLUDED WITH YOUR PURCHASE!  We will personally color match two select pair of laces to spice up your high top and low top shoes, for FREE!

Indiegogo bonus: FREE DESIGNER KEEPSAKE BOX!  
The illustration extends around the entire package...all four sides, top and bottom.  Save it for your swag.

Keeping it real: Bickman has designed each shoe to be a personal work of art, from the individual image to the II:II logo to the hand drawn box.  This is a true labor of love coming straight from the heART. The promo video was created this summer as she road-tripped from New York to Los Angeles and back again, all the while asking friends and family to model the shoes, using a portable video camera and i Movie to put it all together.  There is no big fancy advertising machine here...just an artist, an idea, a paint brush/canvas, a computer, a camera and a dream....and a partner factory to make the product real.  A vision manifested from her studio to your feet.

<p>Millennia is an up and coming Luxury British watch brand dedicated in catering high value Swiss movements, geared towards the millennial market.</p>
<p>Despite the market being flooded with other minimalist brands, our brand competes on the value of the watch we bring to the market as opposed to price.</p>
<p>A lot of the well-established  brands are able to offer a quality timepiece but the brand fails to speak to the millennial generation. On the other hand, there are certain brands that are popular with millennial audiences but use poor quality components in the production process and are unable to provide a durable watch.</p>
<p>We always admired the heritage watch brands of Switzerland, neither of us owned a very expensive watch like a Rolex, but we liked the idea of creating our own brand that could provide durable and desirable Swiss-Made watches. Nonetheless geared to an audience similar to ourselves, in particular young professionals and entrepreneurs. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558732989/ln2pawocn8jpe9shqd6p.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>The idea of creating a watch brand came during our school days, when we were studying for our A-Levels. This is the crossroads in life where a lot of young people ask themselves what am I going to do now?</p>
<p>Having participated in the 'Young Enterprise Project' during our last two years of Sixth Form; this enabled us to create and manufacture our first product called the Pocket Pal.</p>
<p>After 15 hour days hustling in local markets ... It was a success!</p>
<p>We were able to raise enough money to officially create Millennia. Following on from our previous successes, we started cold approaching our target audience on the streets of London, eventually building an email marketing list of over a thousand people.</p>
<p>Despite having an official logo and a strong list of potential customers, we still needed a little more to have Millennia's first ever production run.</p>
<p>As a result, we looked towards Virgin Start-Up for help. After a long and strenuous period our loan application was finally approved. This enabled us to take that next step into bringing Millennia to life.  From the loan, we were able to purchase our first batch of Millennia watches and put together social media content to the best of our ability.</p>

<p>Millennia London offers watches that are not only contemporary in their designs, but is also produced with the highest quality of materials. </p>
<p>If you don't want to wear your most expensive watch everyday, Millennia watches are a great inexpensive alternative where the quality is not compromised as a result.</p>
<p>Whether you are going about your regular day-to-day, attending a meeting of any sort or even special occasions like a formal dinner party; Millennia watches not only presents high class through its design simplicity but also great desirability due to the values associated with the brand.</p>
<p>We need your support to enable us to make this a reality, and with your help you can be a part of the vision.  We simply cannot sustain the growth of the business from just our own pockets. That's why we have turned to the public to assist us in bringing the next best watch brand to the market. </p>

</div></div>","Millennia is an up and coming Luxury British watch brand dedicated in catering high value Swiss movements, geared towards the millennial market.
Despite the market being flooded with other minimalist brands, our brand competes on the value of the watch we bring to the market as opposed to price.
A lot of the well-established  brands are able to offer a quality timepiece but the brand fails to speak to the millennial generation. On the other hand, there are certain brands that are popular with millennial audiences but use poor quality components in the production process and are unable to provide a durable watch.
We always admired the heritage watch brands of Switzerland, neither of us owned a very expensive watch like a Rolex, but we liked the idea of creating our own brand that could provide durable and desirable Swiss-Made watches. Nonetheless geared to an audience similar to ourselves, in particular young professionals and entrepreneurs. 
 


The idea of creating a watch brand came during our school days, when we were studying for our A-Levels. This is the crossroads in life where a lot of young people ask themselves what am I going to do now?
Having participated in the 'Young Enterprise Project' during our last two years of Sixth Form; this enabled us to create and manufacture our first product called the Pocket Pal.
After 15 hour days hustling in local markets ... It was a success!
We were able to raise enough money to officially create Millennia. Following on from our previous successes, we started cold approaching our target audience on the streets of London, eventually building an email marketing list of over a thousand people.
Despite having an official logo and a strong list of potential customers, we still needed a little more to have Millennia's first ever production run.
As a result, we looked towards Virgin Start-Up for help. After a long and strenuous period our loan application was finally approved. This enabled us to take that next step into bringing Millennia to life.  From the loan, we were able to purchase our first batch of Millennia watches and put together social media content to the best of our ability.
 



 
Millennia London offers watches that are not only contemporary in their designs, but is also produced with the highest quality of materials. 
If you don't want to wear your most expensive watch everyday, Millennia watches are a great inexpensive alternative where the quality is not compromised as a result.
Whether you are going about your regular day-to-day, attending a meeting of any sort or even special occasions like a formal dinner party; Millennia watches not only presents high class through its design simplicity but also great desirability due to the values associated with the brand.
We need your support to enable us to make this a reality, and with your help you can be a part of the vision.  We simply cannot sustain the growth of the business from just our own pockets. That's why we have turned to the public to assist us in bringing the next best watch brand to the market.

<h1>WHY ‘TOUCHWOOD’ FOR LIFE?</h1>
<p><i><b>To ""touchwood” is to avoid bad luck, bring good luck.</b></i></p>
<p>There must have been a time in your life when someone, or yourself, for that matter, has uttered the words ‘touchwood’ but there has never been any wood around for you to touch. The history and tradition of ‘touch/knock on wood’ is long debated, however, it seems to be a familiar phrase across many cultures.</p>
<p>In Pagan belief, trees were thought to be home of bad spirits and people would knock on wood to request good luck or distract the spirits from evil intentions. As time has elapsed people have developed their own version of the belief, which is well known today as touching wood for luck. </p>
<p><b>WHO WE ARE</b></p>
<p>The touchwood team comprises of three aspiring young men, Galvin Mendez, Varpreet Batra and Deshveer Singh who saw an opportunity to bring this sense of ‘luck’ to people in a unique and stylish way. We grew up together and noticed people with increasingly complex lives and an obsession with wealth, yet people instinctively continued to rely on a sense of luck and hope for a better future.</p>
<div>

<p>With hopes of empowering people and spreading positivity, we introduce a product line that incorporates the need for functionality and also the yearn for luck. Touchwood For Life is more than just wooden products, we believe it is and want it to be a lifestyle brand. We hope Touchwood creates a sense of luck that everyone wants in their life and we intend to convey with it a sense of class, originality and style. </p>
<p>To ensure that luck reaches everyone, the Touchwood product line includes men and women’s accessories suitable for any occasion. It can be worn to a picnic or may even help strike up a conversation at a black tie event, so please don’t miss out on the opportunity to stand out and be different, make sure you get your Touchwood products before the campaign ends.</p>

<b>WHY WOOD</b><p></p>
<p>At touchwood we believe that its everyone’s responsibility to preserve our planet. All our products are Eco-friendly and sustainable, made from natural woods. Our products really do showcase the Fusion between Nature and technology. </p>
<p>There are not many renewable materials that we have on this planet. Wood is one of the few exceptions. If we are careful about how we manage forests we can grow new wood to replace the wood we use. When wood is used in the production process for products the carbon is stored away and doesn't get back into the atmosphere until the wood product decays or is burnt. </p>
<p>This may take decades or even centuries. Furthermore, we can make things out of wood that we would otherwise have to make from materials that are hazardous to the environment when they are made - like metals, concrete and plastics.</p>

To ""touchwood” is to avoid bad luck, bring good luck.
There must have been a time in your life when someone, or yourself, for that matter, has uttered the words ‘touchwood’ but there has never been any wood around for you to touch. The history and tradition of ‘touch/knock on wood’ is long debated, however, it seems to be a familiar phrase across many cultures.
In Pagan belief, trees were thought to be home of bad spirits and people would knock on wood to request good luck or distract the spirits from evil intentions. As time has elapsed people have developed their own version of the belief, which is well known today as touching wood for luck. 
WHO WE ARE
The touchwood team comprises of three aspiring young men, Galvin Mendez, Varpreet Batra and Deshveer Singh who saw an opportunity to bring this sense of ‘luck’ to people in a unique and stylish way. We grew up together and noticed people with increasingly complex lives and an obsession with wealth, yet people instinctively continued to rely on a sense of luck and hope for a better future.

THE BRAND
With hopes of empowering people and spreading positivity, we introduce a product line that incorporates the need for functionality and also the yearn for luck. Touchwood For Life is more than just wooden products, we believe it is and want it to be a lifestyle brand. We hope Touchwood creates a sense of luck that everyone wants in their life and we intend to convey with it a sense of class, originality and style. 
To ensure that luck reaches everyone, the Touchwood product line includes men and women’s accessories suitable for any occasion. It can be worn to a picnic or may even help strike up a conversation at a black tie event, so please don’t miss out on the opportunity to stand out and be different, make sure you get your Touchwood products before the campaign ends.

WHY WOOD
At touchwood we believe that its everyone’s responsibility to preserve our planet. All our products are Eco-friendly and sustainable, made from natural woods. Our products really do showcase the Fusion between Nature and technology. 
There are not many renewable materials that we have on this planet. Wood is one of the few exceptions. If we are careful about how we manage forests we can grow new wood to replace the wood we use. When wood is used in the production process for products the carbon is stored away and doesn't get back into the atmosphere until the wood product decays or is burnt. 
This may take decades or even centuries. Furthermore, we can make things out of wood that we would otherwise have to make from materials that are hazardous to the environment when they are made - like metals, concrete and plastics.


WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT!

As three aspiring young men, we need your help! Spread your love for what Touchwood products are all about. Please contribute funds to our Kick-Starter campaign: It will help share sense of luck that Touchwood products bring and will provide necessary funds which can be used to expand our range.
It will give you ""superstars"" the opportunity see more of Touchwood's future range through different shapes, sizes. We want to see the products held or worn by everyone around the world. ""Lets not create a business but lets build a community!"" The funding will also else help with much needed large-scale marketing and production.
People involved in the kick-starter community are either launching or backing products. Our goal is to represent a brand that is not only here to become successful, but is truly focused on empowering our customers by the brand’s positivity, class, and pure wooden luck. Just TOUCHWOOD!
 THANK YOU IN ADVANCE FOR ALL YOUR HELP!!!!

 underwent 16 surgeries in his first 2 years of life, all in hopes of 
improving his likelihood for sight. When Ben and Laura researched future
 eyewear possibilities for Jonas, they were uninspired by existing 
options. Therein Jonas Paul Eyewear was born, created to offer eyewear 
to Jonas and other children that would excite, inspire, and help them 
feel beautiful.<br/></p><div>The are millions of children in America being barraged with the confidence deflating words ""nerd"" and ""four eyes"" — their peers mocking them because they have to wear corrective eyewear.  While to some this may seem trivial or ""kids being kids,"" a child's self-esteem and identity can be cemented as young as the age of 8.  This identity is deeply molded and influenced by their peers as they form an initial view of how they fit into the world.<br/><br/>We feel that this needs to change ... and we thought to ourselves ....<br/><br/>Why do children's glasses have to be embarrassing?  Why can't they be a fashion statement like they are for adults?  Why can't we bring new form to children's eyewear, removing the stigma and instilling confidence and excitement in children who have to wear them?<br/><br/>We're the first of our kind: a provider of simple, elegant, high quality <a href=""http://jonaspauleyewear.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">kids glasses</a> at an affordable price.

<h3></h3>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Below are some of the benefits of your contribution :</b></p>
<p><b>•  Our brand and mission are good news for kids who wear or want glasses.</b></p>
<p>We believe in Jonas Paul Eyewear. We believe kids should have high quality, low-cost eyewear options that inspire them and help them feel beautiful. And we believe kids and families around the world will love the possibility of excellent frames without great expense. We hope to grow our brand and outreach so more people can benefit from our products. </p>
<p><b>•  We want to make children’s prescription eyewear affordable.</b></p>
<p>For parents whose kids require glasses, cost can be the most daunting consideration as the average pair of prescription frames can cost $275 - $390. High quality frames are expensive, lenses are overpriced, and kids have a sweet way of scratching and scuffing their most fragile and expensive goods. We want to provide families a haven among the high prices: Jonas Paul Eyewear prescription eyeglasses cost $99.00, prescription included; our frames are made from high-quality, durable acetate; and they look stellar, so kids love wearing and taking care of them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>•  We want to provide eye care and opportunity for those in developing countries.</b></p>
<p>With the purchase of every frame, Jonas Paul Eyewear donates to CBM 
International to support the eye care and welfare of persons around the 
world.  This impact is made through eye tests, corrective eyewear, 
cataract 
surgeries and preventative medicine for ""river blindness"" (which is the 
leading cause of blindness in developing countries).  The more we grow, 
the better we can support the health and wellbeing of persons in need 
and, in turn, the more those affected can develop unique solutions for 
their own communities. We want to help others make an impact with our 
enterprise.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>•  We want to encourage children to feel beautiful and be confident in their eyeglasses<br/></b></p>
<p>In our opinion, it is unacceptable that children still feel embarrassed when they have to get eyeglasses.  For adults, eyeglasses are a fashion accessory, and many wear glasses even when they don't need vision correction!  Why can't it be the same way for children?!</p>

</div></div>","JONAS PAUL EYEWEAR WEBSITE
 Jonas Paul Eyewear was launched by Ben and Laura, whose son, Jonas, was 
born with a rare visual impairment that rendered him nearly blind. Jonas
 underwent 16 surgeries in his first 2 years of life, all in hopes of 
improving his likelihood for sight. When Ben and Laura researched future
 eyewear possibilities for Jonas, they were uninspired by existing 
options. Therein Jonas Paul Eyewear was born, created to offer eyewear 
to Jonas and other children that would excite, inspire, and help them 
feel beautiful.The are millions of children in America being barraged with the confidence deflating words ""nerd"" and ""four eyes"" — their peers mocking them because they have to wear corrective eyewear.  While to some this may seem trivial or ""kids being kids,"" a child's self-esteem and identity can be cemented as young as the age of 8.  This identity is deeply molded and influenced by their peers as they form an initial view of how they fit into the world.We feel that this needs to change ... and we thought to ourselves ....Why do children's glasses have to be embarrassing?  Why can't they be a fashion statement like they are for adults?  Why can't we bring new form to children's eyewear, removing the stigma and instilling confidence and excitement in children who have to wear them?We're the first of our kind: a provider of simple, elegant, high quality kids glasses at an affordable price. Our CPSC Certified frames are both durable and flexible; they are made from custom acetate in warm, rich hues and trendy styles.  We have a free home try on kit with free shipping both ways that allows children to try on our frames in the comfort of their own home.  And when you purchase frames at jonaspauleyewear.com, you can submit your prescription for us to fill before shipping them right to your door. Pretty cool, huh? We think so.


For each pair of Jonas Paul Eyewear frames purchased, we give 10% to CBM International to bring vision to a person in need through a pair of glasses or corrective surgery.We believe it is possible for enterprise to positively impact the world around us.Jonas Paul Eyewear seeks to inspire style, provide purpose, and meet the needs of those who share our vision and those whose vision is compromised.The number of individuals living with a curable visual impairment is overwhelming. Through the service of CBM International, your purchase of a Jonas Paul Eyewear frame can help cover the cost of an individual’s eye care and deliver sustainable change to these individuals and their communities. Our partnership provides corrective eyeglasses for children, anti-parasitic medicines to prevent Onchocerciasis (also known as river blindness), and cataract surgeries for both children and adults.Through CBM, we are sharing sight with those who need it, and we need your passion to make it a reality.Bring your passion to our vision, and join us in Buy Sight, Give Sight.





   




We're hoping you will contribute to our campaign goal of $20,000!
Your contribution will go toward increasing brand awareness for Jonas Paul Eyewear, launching our new apparel line, and launching new limited edition frames. When parents find out their kids need glasses, we want them to say, ""Finally! I've been waiting for an excuse to buy Jonas Paul Eyewear frames."" But first, parents have to know who we are & where to find us. That's where you come in.

Contributions from this campaign will be used to grow Jonas Paul Eyewear in 3 areas :
1.  We will be able to better broadcast our story, brand, and mission into the world of waiting parents.  We will bring awareness to very people who await our unique product, and 
they'll have access to high-quality, stylish frames.  Everybody wins!  
2.  We will launch exclusive, limited release frames that our Indiegogo supporters will have first access to!  These frames may only be available to Indiegogo supporters with the limited supply we will be producing ... so if you want access them make sure you contribute!  (see images below, estimated delivery mid June 2015) 




note : there may be additional styles and colors available depending on the success of our campaign




3.  We will launch our apparel line, which features empowering phrases for 
kids that we hope will be a tool to remove the
 stigma associated with eyeglasses for children.  (see images below)





And don't think we forgot about you! When you donate, you'll have your pick of a range of gifts from us ... scroll down to see the perks below.












Below are some of the benefits of your contribution :
•  Our brand and mission are good news for kids who wear or want glasses.
We believe in Jonas Paul Eyewear. We believe kids should have high quality, low-cost eyewear options that inspire them and help them feel beautiful. And we believe kids and families around the world will love the possibility of excellent frames without great expense. We hope to grow our brand and outreach so more people can benefit from our products. 
•  We want to make children’s prescription eyewear affordable.
For parents whose kids require glasses, cost can be the most daunting consideration as the average pair of prescription frames can cost $275 - $390. High quality frames are expensive, lenses are overpriced, and kids have a sweet way of scratching and scuffing their most fragile and expensive goods. We want to provide families a haven among the high prices: Jonas Paul Eyewear prescription eyeglasses cost $99.00, prescription included; our frames are made from high-quality, durable acetate; and they look stellar, so kids love wearing and taking care of them. 

•  We want to provide eye care and opportunity for those in developing countries.
With the purchase of every frame, Jonas Paul Eyewear donates to CBM 
International to support the eye care and welfare of persons around the 
world.  This impact is made through eye tests, corrective eyewear, 
cataract 
surgeries and preventative medicine for ""river blindness"" (which is the 
leading cause of blindness in developing countries).  The more we grow, 
the better we can support the health and wellbeing of persons in need 
and, in turn, the more those affected can develop unique solutions for 
their own communities. We want to help others make an impact with our 
enterprise.

•  We want to encourage children to feel beautiful and be confident in their eyeglasses
In our opinion, it is unacceptable that children still feel embarrassed when they have to get eyeglasses.  For adults, eyeglasses are a fashion accessory, and many wear glasses even when they don't need vision correction!  Why can't it be the same way for children?!

Nomada Apparel é uma marca criada em função das actividades feitas na região, os Açores, que estão cada vez mais virados para o turismo ativo e os desportos radicais, tendo em conta a natureza que os envolve.
Nomada Apparel is a brand developed for the activities done in the region, the Azores, which are increasingly facing the active tourism and adventure sports in view of the nature that surrounds them.

Nos Açores podemos encontrar a geografia perfeita para se ser nómada nos dias que correm, porque tudo está naturalmente feito para recompensar o nosso olhar.
In the Azores we can find the perfect geography to be nomadic these days because everything is naturally made to reward our eyes.



Com esta marca, pretende-se que o público-alvo sejam os habitantes das ilhas dos Açores, mas essencialmente os turistas que as visitam, de modo a que se sintam confortáveis e directamente ligados ao local de visita.

With this brand, it is intended that the target audience are the inhabitants of the Azores islands, but mainly tourists who visit, so that feel comfortable and connected directly to the place.


Em cada produto criado com a marca Nomada Apparel é possível encontrar consistência e simplicidade, para que o cliente possa estar o mais satisfeito possível.

Conto com a sua ajuda para obter um stock mínimo para uma primeira fase de venda online e, posteriormente, efectuar vendas físicas num local próprio.
I count on your help to get a minimum stock for a first online sales phase and subsequently perform a physical sales site.



Agradeço qualquer crítica construtiva para poder preencher qualquer lacuna ao criar produtos que se adaptem às necessidades da região.
I appreciate any constructive criticism in order to fill any gaps to create products that address the needs of the region.




Analisando o enquadramento da marca no mercado, o risco a enfrentar é mínimo e a própria marca dar-se-á a conhecer a uma pequena parte da população. No entanto, o principal objectivo é que a marca seja reconhecida e desejada por grande parte do público-alvo.
Analyzing the environment of the brand in the market, the risk is minimal facing and the brand itself is will make themselves known to a small part of the population. However, the main objective is that the brand is recognized and desired by most of the target audience.



Caso o projecto seja bem sucedido será possível incorporar um maior número de peças de vestuário e, assim, reduzir custos de produção. Isto traduzirá numa maior rentabilidade da marca e, ao mesmo tempo, uma maior notoriedade seja para o vendedor como para o consumidor final.
If the project is successful will be possible to incorporate a greater number of garments and thus reduce production costs. This will lead to a higher yield of the mark and at the same time, a higher reputation is for the seller and for the final consumer.

age 5, and 1 out of 5 of those children dies of a vaccine-preventable disease. During
a college summer internship in Cusco, Peru, our founder Lauren noticed that indigenous,
low-income moms weren’t remembering to bring their children in to the clinic for vaccinations
on time, although vaccines were available for free and moms knew vaccines were
important for their children’s health. </p>
<p>The <a href=""http://www.almasanaproject.org/the-problem/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.almasanaproject.org/the-problem/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">reason moms came late</a> was because they were handed
a small paper reminder, which quickly got lost and the date forgotten. That
meant that nurses had to leave overcrowded clinics to go door-to-door in remote
villages to remind moms, and unused vaccines expired and had to be thrown out. </p>
<p>After learning more about the problem from nurses
and moms, Lauren designed a simple bracelet adapted to their resource-poor environment
so that moms could remind themselves of their children's vaccination dates. </p>
<p>Later, Lauren founded <a href=""http://www.almasanaproject.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://www.almasanaproject.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Alma Sana Inc.</a>, a nonprofit
social enterprise, whose mission is to ensure that every child, no matter where he or she lives, gets life-saving vaccinations on time. After a very successful <a href=""http://www.almasanaproject.org/pilot-studies/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://www.almasanaproject.org/pilot-studies/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">initial research study</a> in Peru and Ecuador funded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates
Foundation, we’re ready to reach more moms and babies – in Nigeria, Pakistan,
and Colombia – and measure our impact, together with our partners and your
financial support. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437430654/fecelozu0nbo3fjomcrr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h1>Simple Bracelets as Vaccine Reminders</h1><div>
<p>Our bracelets were designed <b>specifically to fit the needs of uneducated moms living on $1.25 or less a day.</b> Designed with indigenous moms and
nurses, the bracelet uses only numbers and symbols – no words – to convey a child’s entire
vaccination record. Corresponding guides help nurses and moms decode the symbols. </p>
<p>By
looking at the bracelet, a mom knows the number and type of vaccines her
child has received and the date of the child’s next immunization. Each symbol
represents a different vaccine, and each number represents the child’s age in
months. Nurses hole punch out symbols on the bracelet to show that a child has been vaccinated. It's <a href=""http://www.almasanaproject.org/our-approach/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">designed</a> to be worn by the child
from birth to 4 years. Nurses can easily
put it on babies with minimal time and effort. The bracelets are <b>highly customizable</b> to local culture and needs and cost about $0.10 each. They are also waterproof, durable, comfortable, and baby-safe. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437434361/gxlpxabazntmknepzjjs.png"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>
</div><p>Beyond
reminders, the bracelets can help <b>increase moms’ awareness</b> about the individual
vaccinations her child requires and received. The majority of moms, when asked,
don't know the names of the vaccines their children have received and the
diseases these vaccines protect against. This information is important to build
community champions for vaccinations, which has the potential to increase
vaccination timeliness and reduce moms' concerns about vaccines. </p><p></p><h1><b>Where Your Funding Is Going</b></h1>
<p></p><p>We need $100,000 so that we can get started on
reaching more children with our bracelets. Your funding goes entirely toward our Phase II study which will be
a full <b>impact evaluation</b> and <b>randomized controlled trial</b>. We’ll be
assessing the impact of the bracelets’ use in terms of effectiveness,
cost-effectiveness and operational feasibility in Nigeria, Pakistan, and
Colombia where there is a pressing need for this intervention. The study will run
for 18 months, with all work being completed within 2 years. </p>
<p>We’ll need to create a new bracelet design for
each country. We'll <strong>adapt
the colors, symbols, and layout </strong>to each local context based on <b>pre-testing</b> with parents so that each country's bracelet is custom-made to fit parents' needs, preferences, and cultural values. Based on moms' feedback from Phase I study, we'll add <strong>more bracelet sizes</strong> to fit the child as it grows.</p>
<p>Our study has to be big enough to determine how
much of an impact the bracelets’ use has on childhood vaccination rates, so we’ll need to <b>hire and train</b> <b>local staff</b>
to enroll and follow up with moms, and collect data. We’ll need to create several
different <b>data forms</b> to track
impact, cost, and feedback from parents and health care workers at each child’s
vaccination visit. We’ll need to get <b>local
buy-in</b>, so we’ll sit down with community leaders, government officials, and
other relevant groups to get their official support and <b>raise awareness</b> about the study within communities. Below is an
itemized budget for Nigeria. A similar budget will be used in Colombia and
Pakistan. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437416258/znrtxnwanfrib411wwrf.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h1><b>Why We’re Right for the Job</b></h1>

<p><b><i>Economic burden of
late vaccination</i></b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>Vaccine preventable
diseases such as pneumonia, diarrhea, measles, pertussis and tetanus are the
leading causes of child deaths in these countries. For example, in Nigeria, they

<p>Research is expensive, particularly large studies like this which are necessary to be able to detect the impact of an innovation on a population. We have the advantage

</div></div>","Our StoryEach year around the world 4 million children die before
age 5, and 1 out of 5 of those children dies of a vaccine-preventable disease. During
a college summer internship in Cusco, Peru, our founder Lauren noticed that indigenous,
low-income moms weren’t remembering to bring their children in to the clinic for vaccinations
on time, although vaccines were available for free and moms knew vaccines were
important for their children’s health. 
The reason moms came late was because they were handed
a small paper reminder, which quickly got lost and the date forgotten. That
meant that nurses had to leave overcrowded clinics to go door-to-door in remote
villages to remind moms, and unused vaccines expired and had to be thrown out. 
After learning more about the problem from nurses
and moms, Lauren designed a simple bracelet adapted to their resource-poor environment
so that moms could remind themselves of their children's vaccination dates. 
Later, Lauren founded Alma Sana Inc., a nonprofit
social enterprise, whose mission is to ensure that every child, no matter where he or she lives, gets life-saving vaccinations on time. After a very successful initial research study in Peru and Ecuador funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation, we’re ready to reach more moms and babies – in Nigeria, Pakistan,
and Colombia – and measure our impact, together with our partners and your
financial support. Simple Bracelets as Vaccine Reminders
Our bracelets were designed specifically to fit the needs of uneducated moms living on $1.25 or less a day. Designed with indigenous moms and
nurses, the bracelet uses only numbers and symbols – no words – to convey a child’s entire
vaccination record. Corresponding guides help nurses and moms decode the symbols. 
By
looking at the bracelet, a mom knows the number and type of vaccines her
child has received and the date of the child’s next immunization. Each symbol
represents a different vaccine, and each number represents the child’s age in
months. Nurses hole punch out symbols on the bracelet to show that a child has been vaccinated. It's designed to be worn by the child
from birth to 4 years. Nurses can easily
put it on babies with minimal time and effort. The bracelets are highly customizable to local culture and needs and cost about $0.10 each. They are also waterproof, durable, comfortable, and baby-safe. 



Beyond
reminders, the bracelets can help increase moms’ awareness about the individual
vaccinations her child requires and received. The majority of moms, when asked,
don't know the names of the vaccines their children have received and the
diseases these vaccines protect against. This information is important to build
community champions for vaccinations, which has the potential to increase
vaccination timeliness and reduce moms' concerns about vaccines. Where Your Funding Is Going
We need $100,000 so that we can get started on
reaching more children with our bracelets. Your funding goes entirely toward our Phase II study which will be
a full impact evaluation and randomized controlled trial. We’ll be
assessing the impact of the bracelets’ use in terms of effectiveness,
cost-effectiveness and operational feasibility in Nigeria, Pakistan, and
Colombia where there is a pressing need for this intervention. The study will run
for 18 months, with all work being completed within 2 years. 
We’ll need to create a new bracelet design for
each country. We'll adapt
the colors, symbols, and layout to each local context based on pre-testing with parents so that each country's bracelet is custom-made to fit parents' needs, preferences, and cultural values. Based on moms' feedback from Phase I study, we'll add more bracelet sizes to fit the child as it grows.
Our study has to be big enough to determine how
much of an impact the bracelets’ use has on childhood vaccination rates, so we’ll need to hire and train local staff
to enroll and follow up with moms, and collect data. We’ll need to create several
different data forms to track
impact, cost, and feedback from parents and health care workers at each child’s
vaccination visit. We’ll need to get local
buy-in, so we’ll sit down with community leaders, government officials, and
other relevant groups to get their official support and raise awareness about the study within communities. Below is an
itemized budget for Nigeria. A similar budget will be used in Colombia and
Pakistan. Why We’re Right for the Job
We’ve been widely recognized for our promising
approach and attention to detail in designing a product to meet the needs of moms living
on $1.25 or less a day. Potential Impact of our Bracelets
Economic burden of
late vaccination

Vaccine preventable
diseases such as pneumonia, diarrhea, measles, pertussis and tetanus are the
leading causes of child deaths in these countries. For example, in Nigeria, they
account for about 30% of all under-five deaths. Besides death, the associated
disabilities exert physical, social and economic burden on children, their
families and communities. It has been estimated that more than 600,000 lives
can be saved and $17bn in economic losses averted in Nigeria over a 10-year
period if the country can achieve 90% coverage with Hib, pertussis,
pneumococcal, measles and rotavirus vaccines. 
Demand from mothers for bracelets
We know that there is a demand from moms to
use our bracelets from their feedback in our initial study.

Moms who weren’t
able to participate who saw the bracelets asked questions about how
they worked and asked to use them, creating an opportunity to educate the
broader community of parents about the need to vaccinate their child and to
stimulate an interest in and demand for the bracelets.Demand from health care workers 
At the end of our initial study, every Ministry of Health nurse we worked with in Peru and Ecuador
recommended that the bracelets be incorporated into official vaccination
program protocol. Nurses said the bracelets are “something that needs to be continued”,
“good for the mothers”, and ""an easy way of reminding mothers about
vaccinations”. One nurse from the Ecuador pilot site said, “Mothers are now arriving to vaccination
appointments on time. Before initiating this program, we had problems with the
mothers’ punctuality.” Having their support is critical to the long-term
sustainability of this project. 

Demand from global vaccine community
Many individuals from governments, NGOs,
pharmaceutical companies, and communities across the developing world (and even
in the US and UK) have approached Alma Sana asking to use the bracelets, stating that vaccine timeliness and coverage are challenges in their areas too. Armed
with evidence after this Phase II study, we’ll be able to partner with these
organizations to reach tens of thousands of parents and help every child be
fully immunized on time.FAQIf you know moms like using the bracelets, why do you need to do more research before scaling up? 

Although we’ve been widely recognized for
our work and we know that moms, NGOs, and governments want to use our
bracelets, these would-be partners need to see definitive evidence of the
bracelets’ effectiveness before they would be willing to commit significant
financial and programmatic resources to implementing the intervention on a
large scale. Evidence of effectiveness is important because NGOs and governments don’t want to invest tons of
resources into rolling out an innovation on a large scale if they're not sure that it works better than current

last step we need to take before we can partner with these organizations to
reach tens of thousands of parents and help their children be fully immunized
on time. 

The bracelets
cost about $0.10 each. Why is this project so expensive? 
Research is expensive, particularly large studies like this which are necessary to be able to detect the impact of an innovation on a population. We have the advantage
of having a low-cost innovation, but because we’ll be reaching thousands of

</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I have recently been invited to show my collection at New York Fashion Week (NYFW) in February of 2016. It is going to take a lot of resources, but through this campaign I hope to raise funds to help me successfully get there. Showing a collection in NYFW has always been an ultimate dream of mine, and with your help this could become a reality! <br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<p>While studying at RISD, my personal creative process has evolved dramatically. I find my interests and inspirations to rely heavily on extensive research pertaining to systems of natural sciences and unique elements within our surroundings. Through this research I have been able to translate and reinterpret my findings into one of a kind wearable art pieces.<br/></p>
<p>The work I will be presenting at NYFW ""Spectral Cell"", is a women's haute couture collection based on ideas of growth, spectrality, and generation. Synthesizing my inspiration from nature into tactile wearable experiences, the spectrum of materials featured range from the sleek and architectural to the gestural and organic. This collection includes natural wools, leather skins, and printed fabrics derived from my original photography. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Specific looks featuring the sculptural and vibrant rubber textiles are the product of a collaboration with fellow RISD artist Zoe Lohmann. </span></p>

</div></div>","Have you ever dropped and broken your
phone or, worse, had it stolen? Are you tired of stuffing your pockets with your phone, keys and money or having to carry a bag or purse everywhere so everything stays securely in one place?
To solve these issues, you now have ColorPaks™, a secure, customizable, hands-free pocket for your phone, keys and money!




Let’s be honest, smartphones are
expensive. Dropping, losing or having your phone stolen is costly. As careful as we try to protect
our valuable property, it still happens. As the creator of the SpiderBelt, No-Bounce
Sport Pocket, I saw firsthand how desperate customers had become to
ensure their valuables were secure while working out. Now, recognizing that smartphones are getting bigger and bigger and customers are wanting a more VERSATILE everyday product, I created ColorPaks™!





 



ColorPaks™
are lightweight and worn across your body so they’re virtually impossible to pickpocket. Plus, their hands-free design makes them impossible to drop. Whether you’re shopping and want to have your hands free or you’re dancing and don’t want to worry about carrying a bag or dropping your phone, ColorPaks™ are perfect in any setting. You can even personalize them by choosing your own strap, pocket and zipper colors or by adding artwork and logos for your own one-of-a-kind design.


 






ColorPaks™  come in several sizes, to fit almost anyone, even kids!




My favorite thing about ColorPaks™ has to be all the places you can use them!





100% of your support will go toward equipment, materials and web development, as well as toward marketing and operational expenses.
We can’t do it without you. Your support ensures ColorPaks™ makes it to
market!


     


To reduce the carbon footprint, all materials are sourced as close as possible to Los Angeles, CA, where ColorPaks™ are made to order. All components have been selected for their durability and proven quality. ColorPaks™ are MADE IN THE USA because we’re dedicated to creating American jobs, and your support helps ensure we reach this goal. That said, we ship WORLDWIDE!

VacuumGlow is a vacuum-tube clock that combines
vintage indicator elements and cutting edge technologies.
Rare indicator lamps are used
in VacuumGlow to show the time. Up to 70-s years of the 20th century,
such gas-discharge indicators were the most common way to display information.
Their production stopped due to the development of new display technologies,
therefore, today glow-discharge lamps are a rarity on factory warehouses. We
have combined gas-discharge indicators and advanced technologies in order to
create an unusual and upmarket VacuumGlow clock.The clock can be controlled
through an application on your smartphone by Bluetooth 4.0 protocol. The
applications are now available on Google Play and App Store. The GPS/GLONASS
function is responsible for time accuracy. The data will be updated from the
satellite if you place the clock within 2-3 meters from the window. The clock
case is made of aluminum and painted using micro-arc oxidation, which simultaneously
helps to protect metal from corrosion and ensures pleasant tactile properties

</div></div>","What is CG Studio? 

Hello, I'm Satoshi Mabuchi.
I have been developing a new 3DCG software ""CGStudio"".
I worked on CAD/CAM software bender,
and studied physics simulation in graduate school.
I like 3d computer graphics, but through these experiences, I think that 3D modeling is very hard.
So, I decided to make a new CG software.
After 1 year development from 2014, I released the beta version of the CG Studio on 2015.


At this point, the CG Studio is used for modeling.


In the near future, the CGStudio will be a unified CG software which includes rendering, animation, physics simulation.
I hope that many users create and share your 3DCG products.



  
What We Need & What You Get 
I am going to release product version in 2016, April.
To brush up the software, beta users are really needed.
Beta version of the CG Studio is available from our web site.
http://www.premiumgraphics.co.jp/
I distributed the beta version software to my friends, and they really loved the software.
However, I have no channel to advertise the software. 
At this point, only windows version is available.
The design of the software is platform independent.
If more money collected, I have a plan to release mac version or iphone version.
I have been developing the software more than one year.
To make unified CG software, more users and money are really needed.




   The Impact 
If the project grows, many users are able to create your own 3D models!
Some people will create full CG movies.
Some people will print the model with 3D printer.
I believe that human have great imagination.
I think that with the CGStudio, your PC can be more creative tool.
Moreover, I open my library for the application on github.
You can use the library to your software without permission.



Load Map


As I mentioned above, I am going to build unified 3DCG software. 
The load map may change in the future.







    Risks & Challenges 
Developing a unified 3DCG software is very hard.Many bugs and improvements will be appeared.I trust that many users and programmers will help improvements the software.If you are a end user, let's download beta-version software.http://www.premiumgraphics.co.jp/If you are an programmer, let's checkout the library.https://github.com/SatoshiMabuchi/CGLibMany eyes will help improvements the software.Your feedback is really needed!

<h3>What is Sunshine &amp; Bravado?</h3>
<p>Sunshine &amp; Bravado is a line of magical, ethical clothing for the adventurous &amp; badass women of the world. It is a circle of style for wanderers, sun-chasers, tree-huggers, soul-seekers, magic-makers, bohemians, and the radical, passionate punk babe in all of us.</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT THE DESIGNER</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470157359/d1ecdbnqqkqrh8p1d4by.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Hi, I'm Nikki! </strong>I am an indie fashion designer from New York, based in Columbus, Ohio. I started out as a self-taught seamstress and designer, from a working class family in New York, and went on to receive a scholarship to attend Parsons School of Design in Manhattan. I started out as a ""traditional"" fashion major, but quickly switched to the more flexible major of Integrated Design. I fit in better with the like-minded sustainable designers interested in changing the design world for the better. It was there that I learned about things such as natural dyeing, sustainable fabric technology, and even crowdfunding. I also spent a semester studying abroad at Central St. Martins in London (University of the Arts London), where I studied print-making, textiles, illustration, and the importance of collaborating at a global scale.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471047475/h9qs4gslt9ldds1m6ff4.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>ABOUT THE COLLECTION, Sunshine &amp; Bravado LOTUS</strong></p>
<p>This collection, my first collection, is called LOTUS. The Lotus flower grows from the mud at the bottom of a pond, up through the water, and into the sunshine above. It is a symbol that no matter what hardships you have gone through, life can still be a beautiful adventure.</p>
<ul>
<li><p> I am also working with female business owners who want to bring garment production back to the United States. Sunshine &amp; Bravado clothing is made with love right here in the USA, in Louisville, Kentucky. I dye everything by hand using natural, plant based dyes.</p></li>
<li>This campaign will enable me create a sustainable, earth-friendly, female-powered brand that creates jobs. The fashion industry is changing at a grassroots, indie level: we're tired of an industry that puts garment workers in danger, pollutes the earth, and has a negative impact on women's self-esteem. By using ethically sourced, organic &amp; natural fibers and textiles, and plant-based dyes, my line is encouraging a shift towards a more sustainable fashion future. When you wear Sunshine &amp; Bravado clothing, you will always be able to answer the question, #whomademyclothes?</li>
</ul>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
</div><div>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul><li>This campaign is for $3,500 US dollars. It is a flexible funding campaign. The money will go towards all of the things that are vital in producing a fashion line, such as:</li></ul>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;"">pattern making for studio production; organic fabrics and natural dyes; manufacturing the clothing in an ethical, American studio factory; screen printing; comfy, ethically made Alternative Apparel t-shirts; legal fees for registering a business; care labels, tags, and other legal things required for clothing production. Also, the initial cost of upgrading my website, <a href=""http://www.sunshineandbravado.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.sunshineandbravado.com</a>, to support e-commerce (online sales)!</p>
<ul><li>I have some really awesome, unique perks, including hand-made postcards, screen printed t-shirts, and pre-sales of the entire line!</li></ul>

</div></div>","What is Sunshine & Bravado?
Sunshine & Bravado is a line of magical, ethical clothing for the adventurous & badass women of the world. It is a circle of style for wanderers, sun-chasers, tree-huggers, soul-seekers, magic-makers, bohemians, and the radical, passionate punk babe in all of us.
ABOUT THE DESIGNER

Hi, I'm Nikki! I am an indie fashion designer from New York, based in Columbus, Ohio. I started out as a self-taught seamstress and designer, from a working class family in New York, and went on to receive a scholarship to attend Parsons School of Design in Manhattan. I started out as a ""traditional"" fashion major, but quickly switched to the more flexible major of Integrated Design. I fit in better with the like-minded sustainable designers interested in changing the design world for the better. It was there that I learned about things such as natural dyeing, sustainable fabric technology, and even crowdfunding. I also spent a semester studying abroad at Central St. Martins in London (University of the Arts London), where I studied print-making, textiles, illustration, and the importance of collaborating at a global scale.


 
ABOUT THE COLLECTION, Sunshine & Bravado LOTUS
This collection, my first collection, is called LOTUS. The Lotus flower grows from the mud at the bottom of a pond, up through the water, and into the sunshine above. It is a symbol that no matter what hardships you have gone through, life can still be a beautiful adventure.

 I am also working with female business owners who want to bring garment production back to the United States. Sunshine & Bravado clothing is made with love right here in the USA, in Louisville, Kentucky. I dye everything by hand using natural, plant based dyes.
This campaign will enable me create a sustainable, earth-friendly, female-powered brand that creates jobs. The fashion industry is changing at a grassroots, indie level: we're tired of an industry that puts garment workers in danger, pollutes the earth, and has a negative impact on women's self-esteem. By using ethically sourced, organic & natural fibers and textiles, and plant-based dyes, my line is encouraging a shift towards a more sustainable fashion future. When you wear Sunshine & Bravado clothing, you will always be able to answer the question, #whomademyclothes?

What We Need & What You Get

Break it down for folks in more detail:
This campaign is for $3,500 US dollars. It is a flexible funding campaign. The money will go towards all of the things that are vital in producing a fashion line, such as:
pattern making for studio production; organic fabrics and natural dyes; manufacturing the clothing in an ethical, American studio factory; screen printing; comfy, ethically made Alternative Apparel t-shirts; legal fees for registering a business; care labels, tags, and other legal things required for clothing production. Also, the initial cost of upgrading my website, www.sunshineandbravado.com, to support e-commerce (online sales)!
I have some really awesome, unique perks, including hand-made postcards, screen printed t-shirts, and pre-sales of the entire line!
THE SUNSHINE & BRAVADO MANIFESTO
we consider black to be a happy color, and tie dye to be a neutral. our favorite holiday is Halloween. we carry crystals in our purses. we take any chance to travel. we get advice in this order: first you call your bff, then you ask the Tarot. we believe journaling is a way of life. we care about the earth. we believe that personal style is a high form of creative expression. we strive to make the world a better place. we support fair trade. we believe in the healing powers of art. and we create our own magic.
The Impact

Indie fashion is taking over. It's time to add our voices to the movement to make the fashion world a better place.
My collection is seasonless, which means that it is not fast fashion - the designs can be worn and layered during any time of the year.
Supporting this campaign will make it real. Actual clothing, actual jobs, and an actual community of awesome, earth-saving women in the sunshine & bravado circle. I can make Sunshine & Bravado into my real-life job, my career, my full-time passion, and spend my time making things and giving back. Fuck the side-hustle! Dreams come true!


Because giving is a circle, I am working to collaborate with non profits so that a percentage of every sale goes to help someone else. For this collection, I'm working with:

<p>So I got a little carried away with focusing on trying to make my blog the best it could possibly be, and I think my goal of $10k kind of gave people the wrong idea about who I am and what I'm trying to do. So, I lowered my goal to $3,000 (half of that being for a laptop).</p>
<p>My thought process going into this was if I can get the help I need in a creative way, why not give it a shot! I admire people finding unique ways to go after their dreams and accomplish their career goals. Then sadly, after all of this time and hard work I invested into this campaign, I quickly realized this isn't how I wanted to do it. This isn't how I want to gain my success.</p>
<p>I've always prided myself on being extremely independent and hard working, and I started to picture myself becoming successful both through this campaign and organically, and through this campaign just didn't feel right. I realized that if I went through with this, I wouldn't respect myself as much and I wouldn't feel as good about my success.</p>
<p>It's going to be a long, stressful journey working my way to where I want to be starting from complete scratch, but it will be a much more enjoyable journey, a journey to be proud of. I've gotten myself to where I am now (and I'm not just talking blog/career wise, I'm talking making my own dinners and mowing the lawn since fourth grade, moving across the country to one of the biggest cities in the country and supporting myself completely on my own) and I did a pretty damn good job, so I'll just keep doing what I'm doing and I'll get there.</p>
<p>So, then I decided to take my campaign down. But the joke was on me, Indiegogo doesn't let you take a campaign down after it has raised any amount of funds. And now, for the grand finale: <strong>My Ultimate Decision.</strong></p>
<p>I am leaving the campaign open to anyone who wants to buy any of the clothing, shoes, accessories, etc. I am offering because I still do need to get rid of them. My closet is literally a foot wide and I just don’t have the space. Also, I feel like this would be a more effective way than ebay, and for a better cause and more creative way than selling on ebay. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the end, I don't regret this at all. I've learned so much about myself, what I want and what I truly value. And I've decided to leave this video up because, well...I'm damn proud of it. Also, I could've used an example like this when making my own video, so I'll leave it as an example for someone else.</p>
<p>I sincerely appreciate anyone who shared my campaign and supported me. I never really expected or wanted any of my friends to donate, the goal was just to get this campaign seen by experienced backers who could relate to my story and see the drive I had in me, but I greatly appreciate the friends that did donate, it meant the absolute world to me and the favor will definitely be returned. So thank you all again, I can't wait to see my progress over these next few years, and I can't wait to say that I did it all on my own.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

</ol></div>","OUR STORYWe're excited to launch our first crowdfunding campaign. We are KOJIMA GENES, 20-year-old Japanese denim maker, based in Kojima, Okayama, Japan.We started KOJIMA GENES to build a new type of denim brand that focuses on creating innovative and quality denim at an affordable price point. Our jeans are made with daily wear in mind, and we strive to make “Beloved” jeans.“WAKONAI®” SPECIAL NATURAL INDIGO DENIM AS YOUR REWARDWe have teamed up with the world famous KUROKI MILL. KUROKI’s innovative and quality denim has attracted many high fashion brands throughout the world.For this campaign,  we are offering you the jeans crafted with the same fabric that high fashion brands use, beautiful KUROKI's “WAKONAI®, Genuine Natural Indigo”. We will crowdfund and deliver it directly to you at an affordable price point.  With your support, it will be brought to life with our sleek slim-fit design. We are ready for production releasing these awesome pairs for the first time to the world! Please join us! These pairs will be available only through this campaign!!KUROKI WAKONAI® (JAPAN SPIRITS)WAKONAI®(wa-kon-ai) is Genuine Natural Indigo Dye exclusively developed by KUROKI MILL. It is 100% natural indigo denim and is characterized as the traditional beautiful Japanese Indigo dyed denim, and has a vivid, natural fade in color.WAKONAI® is produced by a special technique, “Awa Genuine Indigo Dye Method” that is globally renowned as “Traditional Art Craft” and is designated as Intangible Cultural Treasure by the Ministry of Manufacturing and Industry in Japan.NATURAL INDIGO IS ECO-FRIENDLY AND SUSTAINABLENatural Indigo is a sustainable resource and is part of an ecosystem where the waste water from the dyeing process can be used to water fertilize the land.Japan has a rich history with indigo. Indigo was brought to Japan around 1400 years ago and gained popularity as a dye in the Edo era (1603-1868). The Natural Indigo dye gives the jeans a richer, deeper color. It leads to a pure, darker indigo color.You can see more details in the following! →More ImagesADDITIONAL REWARD ​- KUROKI EXCLUSIVE 21OZWe will also release 21OZ Selvedge that is heavy and densely woven by KUROKI MILL. KUROKI exclusively developed this awesome denim for us. A special automatic loom “Riki-Shokki” gives the denim a beautiful uniformity of color. As the denim matures, you will enjoy a fade unique to you. With your support, we will bring it to life with our authentic, classic and vintage infused straight-fit design.Production for 21oz denim is very limited and you will rarely find it on the market. There are very few factories that can sew this thick and heavy denim. This special denim is a “Compilation of Kojima Craftsmen’s Techniques”.You can see more details in the following! →More ImagesBENEFITS FOR YOUIf you think about famous high fashion brands, a pair of premium jeans with Japanese denim may cost near $1000 at a department store. The price point was our main issue since KUROKI works with those high fashion brands.Our focus is quality and affordability. So we work with a new mindset to branch off from traditional way to cut out the middle agents to keep the costs as low as possible. We chose crowdfunding as a platform to deliver these awesome pairs directly to you at a most affordable price point.If you buy these quality premium denim, it will last longer! That means it will be gentle to the environment, and also to your wallet. You can get cost benefit per wear when you buy our quality denim that lasts longer, compared to buying cheaper denim that lasts for only one season.WHY CROWDFUNDING?The beauty of crowdfunding is that we can directly communicate with our community. We have learned so much through this campaign. We keep our ears open to valuable feedback and suggestions (positive or negative). We will keep learning more from you and our dream is to build an amazing community with our global audience.WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE?We are planning more campaigns to go. With your support, we will keep challenging to offer you denim with better cost performance for the future campaigns. Also, we want to create denim that YOU will want to wear. We want to hear from you as to what kinds of denim you want to wear at what price points. Please feel free to drop us a line at info@kojimagenesxsf.comSUPPORT KOJIMA'S CRAFTSMENWe want to raise your awareness that the Japanese textile industry is dwindling.The Japanese textile industry used to be huge in Japan, and Kojima has been the heart of the industry since the Edo era (1603-1868). But now with all the companies outsourcing jobs and factories the number of factories in Japan is declining. In 1960, there were around 70,000 textile factories in Japan. That number has dropped to 15,000 in 2010.If everyone plays a role, we will be able to raise awareness to help the textile industry in Kojima flourish again.Our goal is to produce “Beloved” denim to our audience around the world, while supporting Kojima’s craftsmen!ABOUT KUROKI TEXITILE MILLEstablished in 1950, KUROKI is globally recognized as a leading fabric manufacturer. KUROKI continues to make Japan’s denim history creating quality denim fabric by innovative methods. They consider local environment and ecological issues very seriously. Each of their plant is well-equipped with total waste water disposal system.ABOUT KOJIMA GENES x SAN FRANCISCO PROJECT KOJIMA GENES was born in 1996 with the respect toward craftsmen in KOJIMA. We make denim that prioritizes everyone’s lifestyle and to fulfill our customer’s essential needs. KOJIMA, OKAYAMA is globally recognized as the birthplace of Japanese denim and dubbed as the world’s ""Denim Mecca"". MADE IN KOJIMA denim is renowned for its premium construction and incredible attention to detail by highly skilled craftsmen. Two years ago, our journey has started with the simple idea, to bring MADE IN KOJIMA denim to people around the world. We are launching the project from SAN FRANCISCO where our team members are based, in this beautiful city by the bay also known as the “Gateways to the World”.DETAILS OF REWARDSREWARD#1 KUROKI WAKONAI®(JAPAN SPIRITS) SELVEDGE - 13OZ SLIM FIT, Handcrafted in Kojima, OkayamaClick here for more images.Product Details

<p>There are many products for pets, but when throughout my life, when searching for
gifts or other products for my MONSHULS, I noticed that these were always the same, boring
and with little color and lacking variety, made in series and without, and without regard of the interests and objectives of pet lovers as users.</p>
<p>Increasingly, I started encountering other pet lovers who
complained of the same situation and the discomfort it generated them. I also found out, that some of the designs I was selling on Spoonflower were being used to make dog accessories. This time people were using my fabric because they liked my designs, but they still weren't considering humans nor the usability of the product (durable and resistant materials as well as comfortable.)</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475393536/majo_3_aqkda2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>From there I got the idea of creating <b>MONSHULS - for genuine pet lovers</b>; A brand where I combine my
passion for animals with surface design to provide through carefully-crafted
and thoughtfully-designed patterns and illustrations <b>every-day fashion and design products for happier dogs, cats and humans</b>.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>We create <b>objects</b> <b>that allow pet lovers to express their love for their</b> MONSHULS <b>through a shared style</b>.</p>
<p><b>The use of our products result in well-being experiences that</b> allow humans and their pets to share unique items that identify them and <b>allow them to feel authentic, special and part of the same family</b>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, through these objects MONSHULS and their humans
can express each other positive emotions such as love, joy, and satisfaction.</p>
<p>Lastly, research has found that in the same way that occurs in
the relationship between parents and children, the relationship of humans with
pets reduces stress and this in turn, generates feelings of peace and
tranquility in the pet, which positively feeds back the relationship and
bonding between the two. <i>#happyhumanhappypet #happypethappyhuman</i></p>

<p>For the last year, I’ve been working hard to develop the business foundations of MONSHULS with the help and advise of different professionals, and together, we’ve planned to finally see them all materialized in October with the launch of my first collection. </p>
<p>I plan on having a wide range of products, but to start, I will reach my market with: collars, and bandanas for both dogs and humans.

With them they go out, play, run and sleep, which means they sweat and get them dirty without a daily change. Polyester provides better performance against mold, fungi, and bacteria than fabrics in natural fibers such as cotton, and this is why, we chose it for our products; To reduce the risk of odors and dust mites that can hurt both MONSHULS and their humans.</div>

<p>All of the designs start with a MONSHULS in mind and a design trend theme that suits him/her. Once I’ve chosen my muse and theme for a specific mini collection, I do some visual research, come up with a concept and color story for the mini collection and proceed with sketching. I like creating quirky characters and motifs with a naive aesthetic (probably because I think of my MONSHULS as eternal, loyal, and always-ready-to-give-love children.)  </p>

<p>Hi, my name is MaJo, and I am a <i>#genuinepetlover</i>!</p>
<p>After years of freelancing in Italy and my recent return to my home country Colombia, I decided to launch my own label: MONSHULS - for genuine pet lovers. I am a FIRM believer that color, patterns and textures make our lives happier and help us interact with our environment in a more fun and enjoyable way. I have seven MONSHULS that I adore with all my heart and that serve as constant inspiration for my project. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475397757/MS_about_natis_pj4nro.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Hi! I’m Natalia, a recently graduated architect, really eager to start creative projects that inspire me, and where I can join most of my passions. Although I do not own a pet right now, I consider myself a genuine pet lover. I think of them as companions, friends and as important parts of families that only gift them happiness and lifetime memories. I believe pets and design are a great combination that produce unexpected results that bring pets and owners closer and make them both happier. So far, MONSHULS   has been a great opportunity for me to learn, get inspired and have fun! <br/></p>

<p>The responsability of turning the printed surface into finished articles resides on our local mom seamstresses that use their expertise and hands to carefully shape each of our products.<br/></p>
<p>So far, we’ve already chosen three women (Doña Flor, Verónica and Maria Helena) to manufacture our first collection. Each of them will be in charge of bringing to live one specific product.</p>

<b>Mission</b><p></p>
<p>MONSHULS  creates design objects inspired by the unconditional love that characterizes our </p>
<p>relationship with our pets. Our mission is to build a community of pet lovers through creative, original, striking and modern artwork that brings to life imagination and generates well-being.</p>
<p><b>Philosophy</b></p>

</li>
<li>That pets are part of our family.<br/>

<li>That pets deserve care, respect and love.<br/>
</li>
<li>That pet designs must provide pets with well-being. They must be functional, comfortable, safe and beautiful.<br/>
</li>
<li>That our designs should generate positive emotions in both pets and humans<br/>
</li>
<li>That pet lovers communicate through their lifestyle the love they feel for their best friends.<br/>
</li>
<li>In transparency and honesty: with both our customers, suppliers and business allies.<br/>
</li>
<li>In being respectful and fulfilling </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Vision</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>By 2020, MONSHULS  will have consolidated itself as the most recognized brand by pet lovers in Bogota, and will have begun to venture into other markets nationwide.</p>

<p>Hay muchos
productos dirigidos a mascotas, pero cuando buscaba regalos u otros productos para mis MONSHULS, notaba
que lo que había disponible era siempre lo mismo, aburrido y con poco color y
variedad, hecho en serie y sin tener en cuenta los intereses y objetivos de los amantes de las mascotas
como usuarios. </p>
<p>Progresivamente
fui encontrándome con otros amantes de las mascotas que se quejaban de la misma
situación y del malestar que esto les generaba. También descubrí que algunos de mis diseños que estaba vendiendo en Spoonflower estaban siendo utilizados para hacer accesorios para perros. En estos casos las personas estaban usando mi tela porque les gustaban mis diseños, pero todavía no estaban teniendo en cuenta a los seres humanos ni la usabilidad del producto (materiales duraderos y resistentes, así como cómodos.)</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475383053/majo_3_gt3oyi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>De ahí me surgió la idea de crear <b>MONSHULS – for genuine pet lovers</b>:
una marca donde combino mi pasión por los animales con el diseño de superficies
para proporcionar a través de estampados e ilustraciones diseñadas
cuidadosamente y elaboradas detalladamente, <b>moda y objetos de diseño para perros, gatos y humanos más felices.</b> </p>
<p>Creamos objetos que permiten a los humanos
amantes de las mascotas expresar su
afecto hacia sus MONSHULS a través
del <b>uso compartido de un mismo estilo</b>.</p>
<p><b>Nuestros productos generan experiencias de
bienestar porque </b>permiten
que tanto los humanos como sus mascotas compartan objetos únicos que los
identifican y <b>les permiten sentirse
auténticos, especiales y parte de una misma familia. </b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475526005/MS_2_humano_feliz_ciclo_rvrrkz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Asímismo, a
través de estos objetos los MONSHULS y sus humanos pueden expresarse mutuamente
emociones positivas como el amor, la alegría, y la satisfacción. </p>
<p>Por último, diversas
investigaciones han encontrado que de la misma manera que ocurre entre la
relación entre las figuras parentales y las niñas y los niños, la relación de
los humanos con sus mascotas reduce el estrés, y esto a su vez, genera
sensaciones de paz y tranquilidad en la mascota, lo cual retroalimenta
positivamente la relación y el vínculo afectivo entre los dos. <i>#humanofelizmascotafeliz #mascotafelizhumanofeliz</i></p>

<p>Nuestros MONSHULS usan sus prendas y accesorios por varios días seguidos sin quitárselos. Con ellos salen, juegan, corren y duermen, lo que significa que sudan y los ensucian a diario sin cambiarlos. El poliéster ofrece un mejor comportamiento contra moho, hongos, y bacterias que las telas en fibras naturales como el algodón, y es por esto, lo escogimos para nuestros productos para disminuir el riesgo de malos olores y ácaros que puedan hacerle daño tanto a los MONSHULS como a sus humanos.</p>

<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Mis diseños comienzan con
un MONSHULS en mente y una tendencia de diseño que se adapte a él/ella. Una vez que he
elegido mi musa y el tema para una mini colección específica, hago un poco de
investigación visual, defino un concepto e historia del color para esta y
comienzo a bocetar. Me gusta crear
personajes curiosos y motivos con una estética ingenua (probablemente porque
pienso en mis MONSHULS como niños eternos, leales, y siempre-listos para dar
amor.)</span>

MONSHULS /mon-shools/ Commonly known as a pet, but for genuine pet lovers, monshuls are best friends, fur kids, family.


There are many products for pets, but when throughout my life, when searching for
gifts or other products for my MONSHULS, I noticed that these were always the same, boring
and with little color and lacking variety, made in series and without, and without regard of the interests and objectives of pet lovers as users.
Increasingly, I started encountering other pet lovers who
complained of the same situation and the discomfort it generated them. I also found out, that some of the designs I was selling on Spoonflower were being used to make dog accessories. This time people were using my fabric because they liked my designs, but they still weren't considering humans nor the usability of the product (durable and resistant materials as well as comfortable.)

From there I got the idea of creating MONSHULS - for genuine pet lovers; A brand where I combine my
passion for animals with surface design to provide through carefully-crafted
and thoughtfully-designed patterns and illustrations every-day fashion and design products for happier dogs, cats and humans.


We create objects that allow pet lovers to express their love for their MONSHULS through a shared style.
The use of our products result in well-being experiences that allow humans and their pets to share unique items that identify them and allow them to feel authentic, special and part of the same family.






Furthermore, through these objects MONSHULS and their humans
can express each other positive emotions such as love, joy, and satisfaction.
Lastly, research has found that in the same way that occurs in
the relationship between parents and children, the relationship of humans with
pets reduces stress and this in turn, generates feelings of peace and
tranquility in the pet, which positively feeds back the relationship and
bonding between the two. #happyhumanhappypet #happypethappyhuman
Our products are for people with dogs and/or cats, for whom their pets are an essential part of their life and family, and value design objects that allow them to communicate what they feel for them.






For the last year, I’ve been working hard to develop the business foundations of MONSHULS with the help and advise of different professionals, and together, we’ve planned to finally see them all materialized in October with the launch of my first collection. 
I plan on having a wide range of products, but to start, I will reach my market with: collars, and bandanas for both dogs and humans. 


 

Our dog collars and leashes are made with:

100% poliéster webbing (because it can be printed using sublimation)

100% nylon webbing (because it is the strongest and most durable fiber)

100% nylon thread (usually used in leather goods - ensures resilient and secure seams)

Acetal plastic accessories (for its tensile strength, yield strength and toughness)

Zamak cast metal accessories (for its mechanical strength)




 

Our bandanas (slip-over collar and classic) are made with:
100% polyester fabric with anti-stain technology (releases stains and allows moisture to spread and dry quickly)


  

  
 

Our multifunctional bandanas are made with:
knitted fabric in 100% polyester that allows moisture transport and absorption (maintaining freshness during use), sunscreen protection (UV UPF 30-50), and odor control (a technology that controls the growth of bacteria thus preventing bad odors)

Our MONSHULS wear their clothes and accessories for several days without removing them. With them they go out, play, run and sleep, which means they sweat and get them dirty without a daily change. Polyester provides better performance against mold, fungi, and bacteria than fabrics in natural fibers such as cotton, and this is why, we chose it for our products; To reduce the risk of odors and dust mites that can hurt both MONSHULS and their humans.



These are some of the designs that are part of our first collection. We will use them to print our materials and make our products.
  
All of the designs start with a MONSHULS in mind and a design trend theme that suits him/her. Once I’ve chosen my muse and theme for a specific mini collection, I do some visual research, come up with a concept and color story for the mini collection and proceed with sketching. I like creating quirky characters and motifs with a naive aesthetic (probably because I think of my MONSHULS as eternal, loyal, and always-ready-to-give-love children.)  



In order for MONSHULS to take this next step, I need your help. 



With your sponsorship, I will fund supplies and production, design and build our website, and manufacture marketing materials, brand stationery and the basic packaging needed for me to start making my dream come true.









$1 - EVERY DOLLAR COUNTS: Really! If you only have $1 to donate, don't hesitate! In exchange for it, you will have our eternal gratitud and we will send you a nice coloring photo frame (downloadable and printable) for you to put a picture of your MONSHULS in.  

$15 - MONSHULS POSTCARD SET: A fab set with 10 postcards (5 dogs / 5 cats) for you to go old-school and go back to writing and posting happy messages to your friends and family. 

$25 - MONSHULS BANDANA DUO:  One slip-over collar bandana (for your MONSHULS) + a classic bandana or a multifunctional bandana (for YOU!). Dog collar not included / you choose the designs and sizes.

Hi, my name is MaJo, and I am a #genuinepetlover!
After years of freelancing in Italy and my recent return to my home country Colombia, I decided to launch my own label: MONSHULS - for genuine pet lovers. I am a FIRM believer that color, patterns and textures make our lives happier and help us interact with our environment in a more fun and enjoyable way. I have seven MONSHULS that I adore with all my heart and that serve as constant inspiration for my project. 

Hi! I’m Natalia, a recently graduated architect, really eager to start creative projects that inspire me, and where I can join most of my passions. Although I do not own a pet right now, I consider myself a genuine pet lover. I think of them as companions, friends and as important parts of families that only gift them happiness and lifetime memories. I believe pets and design are a great combination that produce unexpected results that bring pets and owners closer and make them both happier. So far, MONSHULS   has been a great opportunity for me to learn, get inspired and have fun! 

The responsability of turning the printed surface into finished articles resides on our local mom seamstresses that use their expertise and hands to carefully shape each of our products.
So far, we’ve already chosen three women (Doña Flor, Verónica and Maria Helena) to manufacture our first collection. Each of them will be in charge of bringing to live one specific product.


Mission
MONSHULS  creates design objects inspired by the unconditional love that characterizes our 
relationship with our pets. Our mission is to build a community of pet lovers through creative, original, striking and modern artwork that brings to life imagination and generates well-being.
Philosophy



That genuine love develops between humans and their pets.

That pets are part of our family.

That pets deserve care, respect and love.

That pet designs must provide pets with well-being. They must be functional, comfortable, safe and beautiful.

That our designs should generate positive emotions in both pets and humans

That pet lovers communicate through their lifestyle the love they feel for their best friends.

In transparency and honesty: with both our customers, suppliers and business allies.

In being respectful and fulfilling 

Vision

By 2020, MONSHULS  will have consolidated itself as the most recognized brand by pet lovers in Bogota, and will have begun to venture into other markets nationwide.
By 2025, MONSHULS  will be the most recognized brand nationally by pet lovers, and will have been able to enter the international market for its innovative value proposition.  





Whatever way or ways you choose to help MONSHULS, know that I will be forever grateful with you, and that by doing so, you’ve demonstrated yourself and the world, you are a truly and passionate GENUINE PET LOVER.
















ESPAÑOL



MONSHULS /mon-shuls/ Comúnmente conocido como mascota, pero para los genuine pet lovers, los monshuls son mejores amigos, hijos peludos, familia.





Hay muchos
productos dirigidos a mascotas, pero cuando buscaba regalos u otros productos para mis MONSHULS, notaba
que lo que había disponible era siempre lo mismo, aburrido y con poco color y
variedad, hecho en serie y sin tener en cuenta los intereses y objetivos de los amantes de las mascotas
como usuarios. 
Progresivamente
fui encontrándome con otros amantes de las mascotas que se quejaban de la misma
situación y del malestar que esto les generaba. También descubrí que algunos de mis diseños que estaba vendiendo en Spoonflower estaban siendo utilizados para hacer accesorios para perros. En estos casos las personas estaban usando mi tela porque les gustaban mis diseños, pero todavía no estaban teniendo en cuenta a los seres humanos ni la usabilidad del producto (materiales duraderos y resistentes, así como cómodos.)





De ahí me surgió la idea de crear MONSHULS – for genuine pet lovers:
una marca donde combino mi pasión por los animales con el diseño de superficies
para proporcionar a través de estampados e ilustraciones diseñadas
cuidadosamente y elaboradas detalladamente, moda y objetos de diseño para perros, gatos y humanos más felices. 
Creamos objetos que permiten a los humanos
amantes de las mascotas expresar su
afecto hacia sus MONSHULS a través
del uso compartido de un mismo estilo.
Nuestros productos generan experiencias de
bienestar porque permiten
que tanto los humanos como sus mascotas compartan objetos únicos que los
identifican y les permiten sentirse
auténticos, especiales y parte de una misma familia. 




Asímismo, a
través de estos objetos los MONSHULS y sus humanos pueden expresarse mutuamente
emociones positivas como el amor, la alegría, y la satisfacción. 
Por último, diversas
investigaciones han encontrado que de la misma manera que ocurre entre la
relación entre las figuras parentales y las niñas y los niños, la relación de
los humanos con sus mascotas reduce el estrés, y esto a su vez, genera
sensaciones de paz y tranquilidad en la mascota, lo cual retroalimenta
positivamente la relación y el vínculo afectivo entre los dos. #humanofelizmascotafeliz #mascotafelizhumanofeliz

Nuestros productos son  para todas aquellas personas con perros y/o gatos,
para quienes sus mascotas son parte esencial de su vida y familia, y ven valor en
objetos de diseño que les permitan comunicar lo que sienten por ellas. 



Durante el último
año he trabajado con constancia en el desarrollo de los fundamentos de negocio
de MONSHULS con la ayuda y asesoría
de diferentes profesionales, y juntos, planeamos ver
finalmente nuestro trabajo materializado este octubre con el lanzamiento de mi
primera colección.
Planeo tener un
amplio y variado portafolio de productos, pero para empezar, alcanzaré mi
mercado con collares, pañoletas y cuellos tanto para perros como para humanos.







Nuestros collares para perros y correas están hechos con:

reata 100% poliéster (porque permite la estimación por sublimación)

reata 100% nylon (por ser la fibra más fuerte y durable)

hilo 100% nylon (generalmente usado en marroquinería - garantiza costuras resistentes y seguras)

herrajes en plástico acetal (por  su resistencia a la tracción, resistencia a la fluencia y tenacidad)

accesorios metálicos en zamak fundido (por su resistencia mecánica)







Todas nuestras pañoletas (para collar y clásicas) están hechas con:
tela 100% poliéster con tecnología anti-manchas (libera las manchas, permite que la humedad se esparza y seque rápidamente)

















Nuestros cuellos multifuncionales están hechos con:
tela en tejido de punto 100% en poliéster que permite el transporte de humedad y absorción (manteniendo la frescura durante su uso), con protección solar (UV UPF 30-50), y control de olores (una tecnología que controla la proliferación de bacterias, impidiendo así los malos olores)




Nuestros MONSHULS usan sus prendas y accesorios por varios días seguidos sin quitárselos. Con ellos salen, juegan, corren y duermen, lo que significa que sudan y los ensucian a diario sin cambiarlos. El poliéster ofrece un mejor comportamiento contra moho, hongos, y bacterias que las telas en fibras naturales como el algodón, y es por esto, lo escogimos para nuestros productos para disminuir el riesgo de malos olores y ácaros que puedan hacerle daño tanto a los MONSHULS como a sus humanos.


Estos son algunos de los diseños que harán parte de nuestra primera colección. Los usaremos para estampar nuestros materiales y confeccionar nuestros productos.




Mis diseños comienzan con
un MONSHULS en mente y una tendencia de diseño que se adapte a él/ella. Una vez que he
elegido mi musa y el tema para una mini colección específica, hago un poco de
investigación visual, defino un concepto e historia del color para esta y
comienzo a bocetar. Me gusta crear
personajes curiosos y motivos con una estética ingenua (probablemente porque
pienso en mis MONSHULS como niños eternos, leales, y siempre-listos para dar
amor.)




Para que MONSHULS
pueda dar este siguiente paso, necesito tu ayuda.


Con tu patrocinio, financiaré los insumos y la producción de la primera colección,
diseñaré y desarrollaré nuestra página web, y elaboraré los materiales de
marketing, los artículos de papelería de la marca y los empaques básicos
necesarios para poder empezar a hacer mi sueño realidad.













$1 - EVERY DOLLAR COUNTS: ¡de verdad! Si sólo tienes $1 para donar, ¡bienvenido es! A cambio de él, te ganarás nuestro agradecimiento eterno y te mandaremos un lindo marco de fotos (descargable e imprimible) para colorear y poner la foto de tu MONSHULS.

<p>Hello everyone!  My name is Jaime Talbot and I'm the inventor and creator of It-Clipz.  I'm formally educated in the field of marketing and hold a day job as operations manager for a major bank's Visa rewards credit card travel program.  I have worked in corporate affairs for over 20 years.  I'm an entrepreneur at heart and always knew I would start a business or launch a product, so, here we are.</p>
<p>I'm 100% dedicated to the success of this product and know whole heartedly that it will hit the market running.  I'm beyond passionate about it.  I have overcome some very significant challenges in my life including severe postpartum depression and thyroid cancer - If these two roadblocks didn't stop me, nothing will! I am well, ready and able to make this thrive.</p>
<p>How did I come up with this idea?  Well, I was in Las Vegas last fall and while doing a lot of walking in high heels I decided to buy a pair of flat shoes to provide some immediate relief.  When I swapped my heels for flats, I was left with a very inconvenient problem: nowhere to put my heels.  So, I designed a clip.  It then evolved and ideas and purposes for It-Clipz began to flow like crazy.  Picture having It-Clipz attached to any and every back pack, handbag, bag or sport bag and using it to attach shoes, boots, hats, scarves, gloves - or any other small object for that matter.  The market is calling out for a product like It Clipz!</p>
<p>If you contribute to this campaign, your gift will bring this product to store shelves this year!  I have teamed up with a USA  based marketing firm with a product line already in major retail stores and online that fits the It-Clipz profile.  Together we will manufacture the product overseas, warehouse it in the USA and distribute to stores in both Canada and the USA.  It will also be available on line.  Production is very costly, especially the first run as tooling, moulds, art work and packaging needs to be designed and created.  YOU can help make this happen.</p>
<p>I need to raise approximately 5000.00 to match my 5000.00 contribution to make production a reality.  Even if I don't reach the full financial goal, I will MAKE THIS HAPPEN.  Every penny counts.</p>
<p>By contributing to my campaign, you will earn product as the reward!</p>
<p>I fully understand the risk involved within a venture such as this.  I am a skilled and assertive business woman with many years of experience.  I intend to overcome every roadblock and hurdle by using my persistence and determination combined with my extensive experience.  Anyone who knows me will tell you that I never quit.</p>
<p>I thank you very much for taking the time to read this campaign and I appreciate your support and confidence in me and my product.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are a group of women volunteers changing our community and empowering our youth through Sports and Nutrition programs.  With the support of Siaya Basketball camp organisers and True Happiness Is Giing Society, we held the first Basketball Camp in the Rural area of Kenya (Siaya County) in August with the help of well-wishers and volunteers who supported us with balls, accomodation and at time transport with over 40 students attending for 5 days</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441812642/nrw0sic9ir8trqlq9pao.jpg"" src="""" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;width: 472.881355932203px;height: 315px;background-color: initial;""/><br/></p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We are looking for your support to raise  <b>usd 3,500</b> to buy  <b>SPORTS SHOES</b> for High school students participating in our annnual camps and do not have the proper shoes for training.</p>
<p>We need Basic training shoes for each of the 100 students who attend the camps with a pair costing<b> usd 35.</b></p>

<p>We will also send regular updates on the camps and all donors or well wishers are encouraged to try attend at least one camp either during the August Holidays which will always be held outside the Capital City.</p>
<p>Any extra will go into buying more shoes as our stretch target is 500 <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">pairs (20 pairs each for 25 schools). Should we not reach our target we will buy and distribute equivalent to what we will have received</span></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The camps aim to challenge and motivate the youth and also give them forum to interact and exchange ideas with their peers and with experienced and qualified professionals. In particular:-</p> <ul> <li>The students are exposed to training and techniques from qualified volunteer trainers both by KBF/FIBA</li>
<li>Motivational talks by different speakers on issues affecting the youth.</li>
<li>Students from different schools get a forum to interact and exchange ideas besides competing</li>

</div></div>","Short Summary
We are a group of women volunteers changing our community and empowering our youth through Sports and Nutrition programs.  With the support of Siaya Basketball camp organisers and True Happiness Is Giing Society, we held the first Basketball Camp in the Rural area of Kenya (Siaya County) in August with the help of well-wishers and volunteers who supported us with balls, accomodation and at time transport with over 40 students attending for 5 days

   What We Need & What You Get We are looking for your support to raise  usd 3,500 to buy  SPORTS SHOES for High school students participating in our annnual camps and do not have the proper shoes for training.
We need Basic training shoes for each of the 100 students who attend the camps with a pair costing usd 35.



For every pair usd 30 Donated, we will send a signed Thank you card signed bu individual student and the volunteer trainers.
We will also send regular updates on the camps and all donors or well wishers are encouraged to try attend at least one camp either during the August Holidays which will always be held outside the Capital City.
Any extra will go into buying more shoes as our stretch target is 500 pairs (20 pairs each for 25 schools). Should we not reach our target we will buy and distribute equivalent to what we will have received
    The Impact The camps aim to challenge and motivate the youth and also give them forum to interact and exchange ideas with their peers and with experienced and qualified professionals. In particular:-  The students are exposed to training and techniques from qualified volunteer trainers both by KBF/FIBA
Motivational talks by different speakers on issues affecting the youth.
Students from different schools get a forum to interact and exchange ideas besides competing
Exposure to opportunities for Scholarship both Nationally and abroad for exceptional talent both academically and in sports.





    Other Ways You Can Help
You can also help by sharing with your friends, communities, religious organizations to support and contribute.
You can also help us collect actual shoes and ship to us (For shipping details email: Rachel at Truehappinessisgiving@hotmail.com)

These packed T's will be shipped off to the warehouses of Amazon from where they will be distributed to their proud owners.</p><h2>Risks and challenges: </h2><p>It's the start of a brand new collection called the White Peacock and I am aware that it won't be easy. Therefore, I have chosen to start with only one T-shirt. The aim is to make it as good a possible, keeping in mind the costs and production satisfaction.</p><p>Usage of UV colors will be a challenge in regards to production and quality. I will distribute the T's to the whole world, so it will be very important to solve the logistic and commercial conditions. However, I am thoroughly prepared and ready for every milestone ahead.</p><p><b>Risks:</b></p><p></p><ul>

During the day, the customer can feel the uniqueness, and during the night, it will reveal what it's been hiding all along. So, Turn Off The Lights.....!The first step to the new brand, White Peacock, is in the form of an original T-shirt, which will transform you into a shining star!T-Shirt - Stars Sky - Light ONThe super comfortable T-shirt is unique in design and style. It's groovy design is custom made for each individual and feels super soft on the skin. 
But during the night, is when the magic happens.......Front PageBackhand


Turn Off The Lights! 
TOTL! effect will be achieved by adding the different fluorescent colors that absorbs the light and re-emit light once the lights are turned off. 



Long lasting effect


High visibility

Please support the production of the T-shirt by contributing a small amount of money in the form of 35€ and I will send you your own unique T-shirt straight after production! Don't forget to add your size and your star sign in the order.Sizes: S, M, L, XLThe amount of T-shirts are limited! The White Peacock Star Sky model consist of only 12 original T's and this is available for printing in 4 different sizes. Each individual will have his/her own customised, original T-shirt!Contribute NowBTW: I don’t count those, who will help with creation of galactic brand White Peacock. To them, I will send the t-shirt also with a small personal gift. After finishing the collection will be on sale only 48 t-shirts 12 stars sign x 4 T-shirt size. One T-shirt will cost 95USD.More planned models in gallery ;)Description of the product, production and delivery T-shirts will be made in the best European factories. Material and production will under supervision of strict quality control and fabrication. At first the material will be printed by the adding of fluorescent colors, which enables the hidden powers of space and the 'turn of the light' effect. The print will have to go through the quality control by means of washing and crumpling it in order to last through years of wear and tear. Once we have printed the material to the desired quality, the T's will be produced from it. Furthermore, the adding of labels, pockets and all the original features of the brand, White Peacock. Completed T's will be controlled and packed into a unique container shaped like a planet corresponding to the particular star sign. These packed T's will be shipped off to the warehouses of Amazon from where they will be distributed to their proud owners.Risks and challenges: It's the start of a brand new collection called the White Peacock and I am aware that it won't be easy. Therefore, I have chosen to start with only one T-shirt. The aim is to make it as good a possible, keeping in mind the costs and production satisfaction.Usage of UV colors will be a challenge in regards to production and quality. I will distribute the T's to the whole world, so it will be very important to solve the logistic and commercial conditions. However, I am thoroughly prepared and ready for every milestone ahead.Risks:

Not enough money collected - might have to look for an investor to fund the project.


Price vs. quality - 3 pre-selected manufacturers in Europe are chosen for comparison of prices and quality.


UV colors and printing quality - each T will go through a quality control process.


Shipping globally with commercial conditions - Cooperating with Amazon.com

Objectives:

Launch of the project


Collection of financial aid


Production of the first set/collection of T-shirts in their different sizes (12 X 4 = 48)


Selling point


Packaging in form of planets 


Delivery of the T's 


Production of a new collection

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I create jewelry featuring Roman and Victorian coins. Most Roman coins are delivered dirty. I clean them with water, oil and dental picks over days, weeks and even months. Prepared coins are placed into settings or wrapped in wire, then hung from unique creations of beads and chain.</p>
<p>No coins are harmed in the making of this jewelry! I'm a historian. Drilling holes in ancient coins makes me sad.</p>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>The $3000 goal will fund several things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coin and jewelry supplies, including materials to produce some higher high end pieces through the use of more expensive coins</li>
<li>A 10'x10' canopy for street fairs, which is often required</li>
<li>Booth fees at street fairs and conventions, which can easily run $200/weekend. My goal is at least ten events this year, hopefully more.</li>
<li>Travel and lodging for out of town events</li>
</ul>
<p>If the campaign doesn't reach its goal, plans will be scaled back in accordance with the money contributed. All money will go directly to the improvement of the business.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Contributors of $10 will receive a historical coin, with a choice of Roman or Victorian.</p>
<p>Contributors of at least $25 will receive a piece of jewelry featuring a genuine Roman or Victorian coin, with a choice of antique brass or silver finish.</p>
<p>I will work with contributors of $100 or more to design a unique piece for them.</p>
<p>All contributors of at least $10 will receive a handwritten thank you card and email updates regarding my progress.</p>
<p>All coins are 16mm to 20 mm unless otherwise indicated.</p>
</div><div> </div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Finding the right venues will be the biggest challenge. I'm beginning with a variety of steampunk events. The Victorian coins should be particularly attractive there, and attendees have a good appreciation for history. They can form my initial base of customers.</p>
<p>I am also in the process of seeking out and applying to suitable art fairs.</p>
<p>Finding affordable suppliers is a challenge for every business. I have identified several which suit my needs nicely, and I am always on the lookout for new sources of material.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the basic challenge of getting my name and my products known. Conventions and art fairs are a major facet of this. An Etsy site provides an online component. But you are also an important part in this. Every time you share this campaign I gain more promotion.</p>

It will hold donor funds for the benefit of domestic workers and their immediate family members in order to enable access to funds, literacy and to build wealth practice, which is to save and invest and to have financial literacy. The Ma(i)de Foundation is the first fund of its kind that aims to actively tackle the inter-generational poverty among the minimum wage earners of the country.</p><p>Of all of the profits that Ma(i)de generates, 50% of it will go into the Foundation in order to build a sustainable source of funding.</p><p>On the board is sit us as the Directors; as well as key financial, legal and business experts.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>As People:</strong></h3><p>My name is <strong>Tuliza </strong>and I am an architect and lecturer at the University of Johannesburg. I am a determined 27 year old who loves to find ways to design sustainable systems that create mutual benefit and shared opportunity, or at least when I’m not making music or teaching. I’ve realized the power in designing the systems that influence space, rather than space itself, and, together with my Co-Founder Mbali, saw that to redesign the domestic worker industry would be to affect the country's most important and powerful socio-economic influencer, which could lead to profound shifts in major sectors and scales of society.</p><p>My Co-Founder <strong>Mbali</strong>, is also 27 and a graduate of GIBS Business School and a former African Leadership Academy (ALA) staff member. She became an <i>au pair</i> while on a writing sabbatical. It is there that she experienced stigma, while developing strong bonds with domestic workers. It moved her to want to help them reclaim their story. On most days, Mbali is fascinated by the idiosyncrasies of human life and thinks anything ‘neo’ is a bit of a sham.</p><p> </p><h2><strong>Why a uniform project?</strong></h2><p><i><strong>Simply put, we can sum up the uniform as the material embodiment of all of the shame and insignificance associated with a domestic worker’s job.</strong></i> Here is some of what they have said about the uniform in the many interviews that we have had with them:</p><p><i>""I feel like the uniform carries all of the shame and insignificance associated with the work I do.""</i></p><p><br/><i>""When you wear this uniform you lose your voice. Wherever you go you do not receive the same service and treatment as others do.""</i></p><p><br/><i>""Sometimes your children are ashamed to be seen with you, and other times a man will not court you publicly. Both are afraid of what the uniform will say about them.""</i></p><p> </p><p>We’ve probably all experienced how our day can be ruined if we feel that we look bad. It can make us lose confidence, it can affect how people see and treat us and it can even affect our productivity. Now if that can happen with the clothes that we choose to wear, imagine what would happen with clothes that we couldn’t choose, that you’d have to wear every day, that makes you feel judged, undermined, devalued and unseen by everyone; even your family members?</p><p><strong><i>Think about it in this way: would you wear a domestic worker uniform?</i></strong></p><p>The domestic worker uniform has defined them so much that those that know nothing about them assume their class, their education level, their community, etc., which are things that they don’t necessarily want defining them, because after all, we are not our jobs.</p><p>We use uniforms to be a part of a collective identity, hopefully one that every member in that collective can be proud of. What then does the uniform about the domestic worker collective say to us and to them: is it a uniform that can inspire pride?</p><p><strong>To be clear:</strong> The issue is not that they have to wear a uniform; most prefer it because it protects their clothes. Many feel, that besides sometimes not being offered the opportunity to choose what they want to wear, there aren’t many options, and those options are often generic sizes that say nothing about their unique personalities; making them all look the same and treated like they are the same.</p><p> </p><h2><strong>Why this uniform?</strong></h2><p>We facilitated the redesign of the uniform under the careful guide of the Fashion Department lecturing staff. <i><strong>The students explored image, as well as durability, flexibility and identity under the concept of ‘</strong></i><strong>enclothed cognition’</strong><i><strong>, which is clothing’s ability to influence a person’s mental functions in relation to what they feel they represent in the outfit.</strong></i> It explains why you have a bad day when you feel bad about how you look.</p><p>This new uniform is a balance between a uniform and personal clothing. Its secret is in its flexibility. The uniform is either a dress or an apron.</p><p>The zip-up, zip-down flexibility lets you very quickly change your entire appearance. The flexible waist belt allows different sized women to tailor how much the waist hugs their body or frames them loosely and it adjusts to a pregnant belly with ease. When zipped up, it is an apron that protects your personal clothes underneath, while at the same time, showcases your personal choice of style. When zipped down, it becomes its own full garment, a synced dress that compliments the female form.</p><p>Our extensive research, studies and interviews have put us in the best position to understand the potential success of this uniform, from the horse’s mouth.</p><p>All of the domestic workers that we have interviewed have told us how they would never step foot in a restaurant with their uniform, because of how ashamed and judged they would feel. This design has not only managed to have them wear it in public, but to also model it in those environments with such pride. One of the domestic workers, Clemmy van Eyssen, can be quoted as saying:</p><p><i>“Wow, I could just quickly change my shoes and go to a wedding in this, that is how different it becomes. I think it is so beautiful. I feel beautiful in it, and in control.”</i></p><p>A lack of confidence and pride and an increase in judgement and shame leads to a decreased level of performance and productivity and increases levels of physical illness, tardiness and apathy. <i><strong>The trickle-down effects of that are huge, as they sustain households and allow the workforce to continue, less strained than we would otherwise be.</strong></i></p><p>What you wear has powerful implications; our domestic workers show us that.</p><p> </p><h2><strong>Who will receive these uniforms and what are the risk factors?</strong></h2><p>There is very little risk to this project, as any amount in increments of R385  or $29 will provide a new uniform.</p><p>The money will go into our company’s Foundation, a protected NGO that is in the process of being finalized, so that nothing can be done with the funds except what it has explicitly been assigned for, which is the provision of 3000 uniforms. <i><strong>For the moment, the money pledged will go into Ma(i)de’s existing business account and overseen by the company’s CFO, Nikki Gajoo, until the NGO paperwork is finalized. We will share those details with you as soon as it is finalized, along with our registration number. </strong></i>We are racing against time to get the uniform line ready in time for the September launch.</p><p>Our project manager and head manufacturer, Christine Muchingami is ready with her team to get the uniforms done. She is a fashion designer and domestic worker, and as you can imagine, is personally invested in making this happen.</p><p>The University of Johannesburg’s Graphics Design Department will be approached to design incredible packaging for the uniforms and once done, we will contact the networks that we are in partnership with, such as the 26 suburbs in Johannesburg that works with our Domestic Watch network founder Penny Steyn to help distribute the uniforms in the lessons that they conduct with the suburbs' domestic workers.</p><p>We are also in conversation with companies like SweepSouth to have their app network receive and market the uniforms.</p><p><i><strong>As it is not one solid body of 3000 domestic workers who are waiting in anticipation for a large delivery, it gives us room to deliver smaller amounts to smaller networks! </strong></i>This is why, every amount counts, because it can influence one network at a time.</p><p> </p><h2><strong>Why us to bring this to life?</strong></h2><p>With a design that has undergone a rigorous process and is ready to go to market, we are ready with a team to get the work done. As a practicing project architect, with success in bringing huge urban design and architecture skyscraper projects to life, you might know that it is no small feat. to bring to life a design that is both beautiful and meets all of your needs. This product does, and as any good design project,<i><strong> it deserves to come to life with the same rigour and care as any large project would be offered, to ensure its success.</strong></i></p><p>Mbali, with a skilled capacity to bring large and often impossible projects to life, will also help oversee the success of the process till the September launch date.</p><p>We are not domestic workers, but we are certainly invested in them and all that their presence has to offer to the progress of our society. It is with that strong belief and value system that <i><strong>we've dedicated our careers to shifting the nature of their industry entirely</strong></i> and we won't rest until it happens. </p><p> </p><h2><strong>What will your money be used for?</strong></h2><p>Here is a breakdown of what you can expect to have done with your money:</p><ol>
<li>
<strong>material costs, incl. clothes labels: </strong>R319 000 or $23 422</li>
<li>
<strong>material delivery:</strong> R700 or $52</li>
<li>
<strong>manufacturing costs:</strong> R 1 155 000 or $84 803</li>

<strong>TOTAL:</strong> R1 932 200 or $141 867</li>
</ol><h2> </h2><h2><strong>How far can your money go?</strong></h2><p><i><strong>For R385 or $29 (the price of 3 orders of Chicken McNuggets at McDonalds), you can dramatically shift one person’s perception of themselves, how much choice and control they feel they have and how much potential they feel that they can realize. </strong></i>That is how much it costs to bring one uniform to life. The reward is not comparable to the price.</p><p>For this reason, we have chosen flexible funding; because just one of your pledges can go a long way into getting this into the market.</p><p> </p><h2><strong>What can you get out of it?</strong></h2><p>The greatest investment that you are making is in someone’s psychological well-being, but that doesn’t mean you don’t deserve to be rewarded for it; in fact you all the more deserve it.</p><p>To invest in the well-being of the person who allows the economy to run smoothly alongside your family’s well-being is to invest in your time and sanity in a society so conducive to stress. For someone to have to wear something that makes them feel ashamed and judged everyday, especially when filling such a powerful role, affects everyday performance and happiness and can, in turn, affect everything around them, including you. To contribute to a domestic worker’s well-being is to contribute to your own and sustain a more balanced middle class workforce.</p><p>You know there is more, and here is how else you can benefit:</p><ol>
<li>For $100, you will receive a special thank you on our Cliff Central radio show.</li>
<li>For $300, you will receive an interview on our Cliff Central radio show (we can have telephonic interview if you do not live in Johannesburg).</li>
<li>For $500, you will have a uniform delivered to you and a special thank you will be given on our Cliff Central radio show.</li>
<li>For 1000 uniforms funded, which is R644 067 or $47 289, your name/brand will be printed on the packaging of the uniform for the 3000 units as well as when they go into nationwide stores. Your brand will be publicized in 1/7 of South Africa’s households as one that invests in the goodness of everyone’s well-being.</li>
<li>For 2000 units funded, which is R1 288 134 or $94 578, your name/brand will be printed on the tag of the uniform for the 3000 units as well as when they go into nationwide stores. Your brand will be publicized in 1/7 of South Africa’s households as one that invests in the goodness of everyone’s well-being.</li>
</ol><p> </p><h2><strong>Why are we grateful?</strong></h2><p><i><strong>With each part of bringing this project to life, we have been invited into spaces that are not ours. </strong></i>The many domestic workers that we have interviewed have let us into their most vulnerable spaces, the University of Johannesburg has let us into their curriculum and now you are taking the time to see that this project comes to life. We want to thank you, not just for investing it its success, but for also entertaining the important and sometimes difficult discussions on it.

material costs, incl. clothes labels: R319 000 or $23 422

material delivery: R700 or $52

manufacturing costs: R 1 155 000 or $84 803

Labour costs: R67 500 or $4 956 for 3 months

Packaging  and graphic design costs: R150 000 or $11 014

Final garment delivery costs: R240 000 or $17 622

TOTAL: R1 932 200 or $141 867
 How far can your money go?For R385 or $29 (the price of 3 orders of Chicken McNuggets at McDonalds), you can dramatically shift one person’s perception of themselves, how much choice and control they feel they have and how much potential they feel that they can realize. That is how much it costs to bring one uniform to life. The reward is not comparable to the price.For this reason, we have chosen flexible funding; because just one of your pledges can go a long way into getting this into the market. What can you get out of it?The greatest investment that you are making is in someone’s psychological well-being, but that doesn’t mean you don’t deserve to be rewarded for it; in fact you all the more deserve it.To invest in the well-being of the person who allows the economy to run smoothly alongside your family’s well-being is to invest in your time and sanity in a society so conducive to stress. For someone to have to wear something that makes them feel ashamed and judged everyday, especially when filling such a powerful role, affects everyday performance and happiness and can, in turn, affect everything around them, including you. To contribute to a domestic worker’s well-being is to contribute to your own and sustain a more balanced middle class workforce.You know there is more, and here is how else you can benefit:
For $100, you will receive a special thank you on our Cliff Central radio show.
For $300, you will receive an interview on our Cliff Central radio show (we can have telephonic interview if you do not live in Johannesburg).
For $500, you will have a uniform delivered to you and a special thank you will be given on our Cliff Central radio show.
For 1000 uniforms funded, which is R644 067 or $47 289, your name/brand will be printed on the packaging of the uniform for the 3000 units as well as when they go into nationwide stores. Your brand will be publicized in 1/7 of South Africa’s households as one that invests in the goodness of everyone’s well-being.
For 2000 units funded, which is R1 288 134 or $94 578, your name/brand will be printed on the tag of the uniform for the 3000 units as well as when they go into nationwide stores. Your brand will be publicized in 1/7 of South Africa’s households as one that invests in the goodness of everyone’s well-being.
 Why are we grateful?With each part of bringing this project to life, we have been invited into spaces that are not ours. The many domestic workers that we have interviewed have let us into their most vulnerable spaces, the University of Johannesburg has let us into their curriculum and now you are taking the time to see that this project comes to life. We want to thank you, not just for investing it its success, but for also entertaining the important and sometimes difficult discussions on it. This is a gift to our democracy, a symbol of how we will always do better and be better. This is us.So tell others about it, ask them and others questions about it and ask you domestic worker about; and while you do that, make sure to pledge and share!  So, let’s talk. If you liked the video, edited and produced by Orange Groove; you can contact the Founder, Justin, on +27 82 504 9771.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>HISTORY</strong></p>
<p>STORMGARD is a British company that was established in 1921 by Mr. A. Whyman in Leeds, England. As a rainwear manufacturer, the name STORMGARD soon became synonymous with specialised fabrics such as enamelled oilskins that were hugely popular with the cyclist and especially the motorcycling community. A decade later, in 1931 STORMGARD began producing specialised clothing for the Air Ministry; most notably, flight suits.</p>
<p>In the late 1930s, Whyman moved his premises from Leeds to a new industrial estate in Gateshead, occupying the Stormgard Works (inspiration for the new domain name) at Team Valley through the Second World War. In 1947, at a trade fair in Earls Court London, the company advertised itself as STORMGARD Guaranteed Weatherwear. Manufacturers of Raincoats, Waterproofs, Sportswear, Leather Clothing, Suits, Overcoats, Golf Jackets, Flannel Trousers, Sports Jackets, Motor Cycle and Motor Clothing. Having probably over-extended its operations, A. Whyman was bankrupt in 1953 and STORMGARD was lost. Until now.</p>
<p><strong>RELAUNCH</strong></p>
<p>With a background in marketing for British heritage brands, I discovered STORMGARD late 2015 whilst researching historical manufacturing companies on a train journey to Leeds. I had co-founded another British brand called Hancock in 2012, a company that I am a part of today and has enjoyed tremendous success over the last 5-years collaborating with Missoni, Converse and other like-minded partners. I had been thinking of creating something new whilst fantasising about the idea of discovering something old, with an incredible back story that no-one really knew existed; the Holy Grail of clothing brands! There wasn't a ton of information about the company online and most of what I found came from a book written by Katrina Honeyman titled ""Well Suited: A History of the Leeds Clothing Industry, 1850-1990"". Reading about the company, I knew that this was something special and looked into any current links to the brand, finding nothing. Once I had registered the trademark, I began collecting vintage STORMGARD print ads, product brochures, original coats and enamel motorcycle pins. What I discovered was that every product had a model number (something I could use in the new line) and that STORMGARD even had it's own motorcycle club called 'Ye Ancient Order of Neverwets'.</p>
<p>Working closely with designers and production facilities for the last 10-years, I understand the importance of materials and craftsmanship. I knew I wanted to contemporarise the product and that I had to find factories in the UK that could make to a globally, high standard. I began looking at fabrics for something specialised as a 21st century alternative to enamelled oilskins and found a mill in Japan that produces high-density fabrics with performance qualities, eg. natural, lightweight, water repellent, UV repellent and shape retention. Next, I developed a simple overcoat design that with this new Japanese fabric could be worn anytime of the year in any city in the world. I like design that is ""super normal"", not overly tricked out, just paired down perfectly, finding the right balance between form and function. The result is the first product to be made by STORMGARD in over 60-years;  a reissue of the original Model 214 Raincoat as featured in their original 1930s catalogue. With another nod to the history of the company, the military clothing contracts are referenced in the garments super lightweight, ripstop camouflage lining.</p>
<p>Every STORMGARD Model 214 Raincoat is made at a tailoring facility in North London that also manufactures for Savile Row. British manufacturing was at the heart of the company history and is a philosophy that will continue into the future.</p>
<p>So, finally I'm ready to push the button and go live, but I need your help. It's important to me that I don't take on partners in the business at this stage so that I can control the product - design, quality, provenance and especially, price. I want a modern, easy-to-wear product for myself that comes from an aspirational brand with an interesting story at a price that's affordable. For now, the product will sell direct-to-consumer via the website to keep the price where it should be. Other brands selling a British made product can retail between £300-500, although the cost to make is more or less the same. With your help, and the power of crowdfunding, I can bring this glorious brand back to life and celebrate the history of the company while bringing a luxury product to the world at a price that isn't going to break the bank.</p>
<p>The STORMGARD Model 214 Raincoat is available in Beige and/or Navy. The cut of the garment is oversized so that it drapes nicely on the body and is an ideal overcoat to layer with suit jackets, heavy sweaters in the winter or over a t-shirt in the summer. This modern cut is tailored to suit most frames and whilst this is essentially a mens coat can look equally as cool on a woman! Sizes are Small through to X-Large and a full measurement chart will be available to customers before orders are processed at the factory so that you can ensure the size and fit is right for you.</p>
<p><strong>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</strong></p>
<p>I have taken every step to ensure that the fabric has the absolute highest performance quality and that the finish of the garment from the cutting to the stitching is at a standard befitting a luxury brand. I am working with one of the best mills in Japan and arguably one of the best tailoring houses in the UK. All my supply chains are set-up and ready to go, so that orders can be placed as soon as this campaign ends. March 2017 is a realistic delivery date but lead-times can change with suppliers if their production schedule alters. In this event, I will update customers every step of the way to ensure complete transparency and to manage your expectations as well as keeping you all involved in all things STORMGARD related.</p>
<p>I also appreciate that size matters (!) Whilst every attempt will be made to ensure that you have all the information you require to inform your purchase, should your garment not fit you in exactly the way you want, or you have any other issues with your purchase, then I will be happy to refund your purchase provided the garment is returned to me at your cost and in like-for-like condition. I want you to LOVE your STORMGARD raincoat as much as I do :)</p>

Jennifer Rothwell has already created a number of timeless collections:Harry Clarke Print Collection Series One​:From Jennifer's Harry Clarke Print Collection Series One, this print is inspired by the vivid colours from the stained glass windows made by Irish Artist Harry Clarke; married with Fairy Folklore Mythology.Jennifer was drawn to The Eve of St Agnes stained glass panels’ and it's use of vibrant purples, blues, oranges and reds. Inspired by the English poet John Keats, the panels tell the romantic story of two lovers escaping to be together on a cold windy stormy night.Harry Clarke Madeline Print Collection Series Two:Jennifer’s second series of Harry Clarke themed prints are based on Clarke’s work inspired by the poem ‘The Eve of St Agnes’, based upon the myth that a young Maiden Madeline would see a vision of her lover if she performed certain rites on the eve of St Agnes Day.Jennifer’s prints are full of rich jewel-like hues, especially purples and blues and accented with golds and gunmetal.  With dazzling colour, etched and scratched effects and immense detail, diverse tones and texture are produced. The prints are infused with light and have a magical and ethereal quality.""The 1916 GPO Print Collection Is a positive commemoration of the 1916 Rising, Irish history and free expression - and 2016 was the 100th anniversary” Jennifer stated. The inspiration for this compilation came from the positive aspects of this controversial era – such as the architecture of the GPO and the famous Hibernia Statue. Hibernia is the Classical Latin name for the Island of Ireland and the spelling was influenced by hibernus that means “wintry. These features are celebrated through sensational tones of purples and blues. The inspiration for the Kells Space Mythology Print Collection design came to fruition after Jennifer’s desire to bring Celtic design into the 21st century. Jennifer wanted to put a modern stamp on Celtic design and bring it into the modern era.“The peacock bird used in the print is from gospel of John who is seen as the messenger between heaven and earth,” Jennifer stated “and I discovered it only after completion of the print.”Fashion designer Jennifer Rothwell is renowned for her colourful innovative unique prints. She's passionate about the made in Ireland campaign and reigniting art and culture through modern contemporary Design.

Having the prints acquired by the NMI is a great endorsement and recognition of the quality of Jennifer's exceptional contemporary design. Being part of the collection is a great recognition for the designer who frequently looks into the past and uses Irish history and culture as a source of her inspiration. “I want to reignite the Celtic revival (also known as the Celtic twilight) of the 19th and 20th centuries in the 21st century, to celebrate Irish artists, folklore, legends and traditions through fashion in a modern and contemporary way.” Jennifer Rothwell said. 

Jennifer's clients consist of other creative professionals; such as artists, writers, poets etc. Irish singer Enya is a frequent client of Jennifer Rothwell and her designs. The below image was featured on the front page of the Irish Examiner, Enya wearing Jennifer's 'Red Jersey Draped Gown' at the Honan Chapel for ""Christmas Carols from Cork"" which was screened on RTÉ One on Christmas Day 2016. 


""In choosing pieces from Jennifer Rothwell’s collections, I felt that these particular designs would beautifully complement and enhance the existing collections at the National Museum of Ireland in that they represent a very contemporary interpretation of Irish events and movements from a century ago.  Jennifer’s Kells print is a modern reimagining of ancient motifs that were popular during the Celtic Revival and her reworking of Harry Clarke designs recalls the best of the Irish Arts and Crafts movement. By incorporating the GPO into a new print Rothwell commemorates the 1916 Rising in a very unique way.  Produced using up-to-the minute digital print technology these vibrant pieces evoke our past and at the same time represent contemporary Irish design.""

<p>My name is Jenniffer Turpeau. I am the creator of Madame Turpeau, an accessory line scheduled to launch at the end of February.</p>
<p>From the line's early stages, I have received an incredible amount of support from loved ones to help me jump-start the line. Now, in order to finalize the collection and launch it, financial backing  is needed. </p>
<p>Your contribution will help finalize all legal structures, marketing, packaging, production materials and labor—up until this point I have been working on my own, but for the success of the line I need some help.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>In order to achieve my goal, I need 20,000 dollars.</p>
<p>Should I not reach the full amount through this campaign, all earnings will still be used to support the main goal of 20K, which I will seek through private investment.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>I have been incredibly touched by how this line has contributed to the life of people. Individuals have reached out to me with personal, timeless pieces from loved ones who have passed, which I am able to transform into an accessory piece they can wear and feel their loved ones close to them.</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Should I not reach the goal on time, the launch will be pushed to a later date. </p>
<p>After the released of the video about Madame Turpeau, in one month I received messages from 400 women interested in purchasing items from the line.</p>
<p>This clearly shows me that it is just a matter of ""when"" for the success of Madame Turpeau.</p>

<p>Hi,
my name is Mark Corwyn Jameson. Several years ago, I had an angiogram that told
me I have two different problems with my heart, which have resulted in very low
energy and some pretty bad days, which have made me rather undesirable to most
employers.  I am not the type to take
this lying down, and it was from this adversity that MacCamie Studios was born, where my goal is to brighten the world with unique and exquisite works of
wearable art.</p>
<p>For
the past several years I have worked to perfect and streamline my art, and to
come up with a product line with a wide appeal. 
Now I’m ready for that next step in expanding my business and a full
launch of my new product line: “The
Errant Apprentice”.  This line started as
an experiment in a new (to me) technique of dying clothing. This technique, though resembling traditional tie-dye, is something else entirely. It creates, through a fundamentally separate process, a watercolor effect that is unique and has found a
special place within myself and my views of the world. 
However, as you might imagine, there is quite a significant cost
associated with starting a new product line and that is where this campaign
comes in.</p>
<p>This
campaign will allow for the studio to not only grow stock, but also to produce
and document the new garments that will now be offered as part of this
line.  This is where you come in! As the
Perks show, you are able to be among the first individuals to own these
products!  This will also allow me to
produce these garments and document them for display at shows, conventions, and
on my website.</p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Here's what we need and why:</p> <ul> <li>$2000 for Initial Stock. Instead of building it one piece at a time, we'd like to get 1-2 pieces of each of our product lines started in each of our 14 color sets. When you multiply that by the different sizes of our shirts and socks, you can see that it would take us a long time doing it one by one.</li>
<li>$500 for Infrastructure.  The internet is a vital marketing tool these days, but we don't want to rely on just one method of reaching out. This means face-to-face sales, primarily at conventions and other weekend shows. We've been putting the majority of our money back into the business, but we could use a few more things like a table or two and a portable awning to hit some more venues, especially in the outdoor shows that the summer offers. </li>
<li>$350 for Photos &amp; Publishing. To help sell our clothes, we need to set up some photo shoots for our catalog, website and general marketing. The more product we have to do a shoot, the fewer shoots we need to do, saving us money. </li>
<li>$150 for a PayPal EMV Card Reader.  With the new Credit Card processing requirements, this is something that is a ""must have"" to protect ourselves and our customers.</li>
</ul>
<div>Here's what we're offering:</div>
<ul> <li>Each of our perks get you one or more of our fantastic products. When you make your choice, you'll get an email from us with a PDF showing you all 14 of our color sets. Email us back with your choice(s) and sizes (if applicable) and we'll start creating them just for you! Be aware though, that since these are hand-dyed, the pictures you get are for reference only of the general colors in each set, and may not reflect the balance of what you get from us. This goes double if you order any of our silk products.</li> <li>If we don't make our goal, whatever money we do make (THANK YOU in advance by the way), will go straight to building stock. Now, onto the perks:</li>
</ul>
<ul><li>$5 - Perk 1: Thank You Card. We appreciate any donation you care to give. So, for a $5 donation we'll send you a nice thank you card printed with an image of one of our color sets including a hand-written note thanking you personally!</li></ul>
<div>

<li>$10 - Perk 2: Wallpapers. We're very proud of our color sets, as you can possibly imagine, and we take a great many pictures when we see our creations unfold.

<p>All of this leads to a quandary: Do I spend my money getting into more shows, or on more stock?  This is where this campaign comes in. I want to expand my business. Yes, I have health problems (money? what money?) but I don't want that to stop me. Being my own boss means I can work on my clothes on my schedule, and being a productive member of society.</p>
<p>BUT, and this is important to me, I don't want to just ask for money. I want to give you something for your donation. It may be a little, like a thank you card, or it may be a selection of my entire inventory. This way, you get something, and I get something. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you can't donate, that's alright. Believe me, I understand. Heck, I applaud you for reading this at all!

</div></div>","Short Summary



Hi,
my name is Mark Corwyn Jameson. Several years ago, I had an angiogram that told
me I have two different problems with my heart, which have resulted in very low
energy and some pretty bad days, which have made me rather undesirable to most
employers.  I am not the type to take
this lying down, and it was from this adversity that MacCamie Studios was born, where my goal is to brighten the world with unique and exquisite works of
wearable art.
For
the past several years I have worked to perfect and streamline my art, and to
come up with a product line with a wide appeal. 
Now I’m ready for that next step in expanding my business and a full
launch of my new product line: “The
Errant Apprentice”.  This line started as
an experiment in a new (to me) technique of dying clothing. This technique, though resembling traditional tie-dye, is something else entirely. It creates, through a fundamentally separate process, a watercolor effect that is unique and has found a
special place within myself and my views of the world. 
However, as you might imagine, there is quite a significant cost
associated with starting a new product line and that is where this campaign
comes in.
This
campaign will allow for the studio to not only grow stock, but also to produce
and document the new garments that will now be offered as part of this
line.  This is where you come in! As the
Perks show, you are able to be among the first individuals to own these
products!  This will also allow me to
produce these garments and document them for display at shows, conventions, and
on my website.   
What We Need & What You Get Here's what we need and why:  $2000 for Initial Stock. Instead of building it one piece at a time, we'd like to get 1-2 pieces of each of our product lines started in each of our 14 color sets. When you multiply that by the different sizes of our shirts and socks, you can see that it would take us a long time doing it one by one.
$500 for Infrastructure.  The internet is a vital marketing tool these days, but we don't want to rely on just one method of reaching out. This means face-to-face sales, primarily at conventions and other weekend shows. We've been putting the majority of our money back into the business, but we could use a few more things like a table or two and a portable awning to hit some more venues, especially in the outdoor shows that the summer offers. 
$350 for Photos & Publishing. To help sell our clothes, we need to set up some photo shoots for our catalog, website and general marketing. The more product we have to do a shoot, the fewer shoots we need to do, saving us money. 
$150 for a PayPal EMV Card Reader.  With the new Credit Card processing requirements, this is something that is a ""must have"" to protect ourselves and our customers.

Here's what we're offering:
 Each of our perks get you one or more of our fantastic products. When you make your choice, you'll get an email from us with a PDF showing you all 14 of our color sets. Email us back with your choice(s) and sizes (if applicable) and we'll start creating them just for you! Be aware though, that since these are hand-dyed, the pictures you get are for reference only of the general colors in each set, and may not reflect the balance of what you get from us. This goes double if you order any of our silk products. If we don't make our goal, whatever money we do make (THANK YOU in advance by the way), will go straight to building stock. Now, onto the perks:

$5 - Perk 1: Thank You Card. We appreciate any donation you care to give. So, for a $5 donation we'll send you a nice thank you card printed with an image of one of our color sets including a hand-written note thanking you personally!


$10 - Perk 2: Wallpapers. We're very proud of our color sets, as you can possibly imagine, and we take a great many pictures when we see our creations unfold. You can get in on the fun by choosing this pic, and get a set of our 14 best pics, sized to your desktop in a high resolution format!


$15 - Perk 3: Knee High Socks.  With this perk, you get a pair of our wonderful Knee High Socks! You pick the color set from the PDF we provide, and then we send you a great set of comfy socks.

Edges are stitched with a stretchy pearl overcast finish.  These will stretch enough, width wise, to accommodate a forearm circumference of 12"" maximum. Pick your color set and make a splash!


$20 - Perk 7: Playing Cards

<div>
<p><b>My bag has a distinctive earthy smell. Will this fade over time?</b></p>
<p>Yes. Because we use no harsh chemicals or dyes, your leather does not give off that “new leather smell.” Instead, each piece initially has a genuine earthy aroma that is characteristic of the natural tanning process. This scent begins to dissipate as soon as the bag is removed from its packaging, and fades entirely in 2-6 weeks.</p>
<p><b>How will my bag hold up over time?    </b></p>
<p>We want you to enjoy your handmade bag for a lifetime. For this reason we invest in the very best leather and fittings. Your straps are double stitched for strength. Your buckles and rivets are made of corrosion-free brass, not nickel, which is why they are stronger and will not rust, tarnish or leave black marks on your leather.</p>

<p>RFID skimming has been demonstrated as far back as 2008<sup><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFID_skimming#cite_note-2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[2]</a></sup> and as recently as 2013,<sup><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFID_skimming#cite_note-3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[3]</a></sup> however levels of theft are difficult to determine, as victims typically do not know how their card data was compromised.<sup><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFID_skimming#cite_note-4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>I wanted to produce a product that was inexpensive and would simply 
work with any current wallet or card holder. There are many products on 
the market that block RFID signals and stop identity theft but use sleeves as the protection.  
You can avoid these bulky sleeves by funding this project. As you can see from 
the last picture all you have to do is insert two cards, one in front 
and one behind the cards you want to block from RFID signals.  For 
larger wallets please use more than 2 RFID Blocking cards. 2 Blocking 
Cards will protect up to 8 contact-less cards.  If you do not carry a 
wallet then simply sandwich your credit cards between 2 Blocking cards.</p>

RFID skimming


From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
								
												
RFID Skimming is a form of digital theft, which enables information from RFID based smart cards to be read and duplicated. It can be used as a form of wireless identity theft or credit card theft among other forms of information theft. Typically it works by illegitimate reading of RFID chips at a distance using a cheap RFID reader device, which downloads the card information.[1]
 From there, it can be written to a new blank card, which then operates 
in the same manner as the original legitimate card. Because the data is 
identical on both cards, and the information is only copied, it makes no
 difference if the original data is encrypted or not.
RFID skimming has been demonstrated as far back as 2008[2] and as recently as 2013,[3] however levels of theft are difficult to determine, as victims typically do not know how their card data was compromised.[4]

YOU WILL BE GUARANTEED TO RECEIVE YOUR PERK(S) FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTION REGARDLESS OF THE AMOUNT WE RAISE!  All proceeds received will go towards assisting us with the financing of our SECOND production run of our New Court/Casual Style (See Stretch Goal Below). This is where you, our INDIEGOGO partners are needed so we can quickly bring more exciting styles and product to fulfillment. WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT!.





OUR PERKS (REWARDS) 






OUR SIZING AND COLORS

IMMEDIATELY at the end of our campaign, we will send out a survey to ALL backers so you can submit your sizing information and your choice of six colors (BLACK, BROWN, GRAY, RED, NAVY BLUE or MUSTARD YELLOW).                                              


  For Men we offer sizes: 7 - 13 (US) / 40 - 47 (Euro)                                               For Women we offer sizes: 5 - 10 (US) / 35.5 - 42 (Euro)
Our shoes are UNISEX and our sizing is TRUE TO SIZE (Example: Size 7 in Men = 7). We have both men and women sizes and do not offer half sizes at this time. We will in the subsequent shipments. For half sizes please round up (Example: Size 7.5 in Men = 8). We do not offer Narrow or Wide Sizes. All shoes are made in Medium Width.  




TIMING & PROCESS

Immediately at the close of our campaign, you can expect to receive a personalized questionnaire regarding your perk (reward) information. All of the product offered in this campaign is presently in our warehouse. Therefore, by the end of June, you can expect to have your PERKS in your hands, or we should say, ON YOUR FEET!




UNLOCKED NEW STYLE...
Once our goal of $5,000 is reached, we will immediately begin production of our New Court/Casual (unisex) style. If you desire this exciting new style for your perk, delivery will be during the month of August 2016. 

THE PLEDGE AMOUNT FOR THIS REAL COW SUEDE/LEATHER SHOE (PERK) IS $60 FOR ONE PAIR. Please advise us at the end of the campaign if this is the style of your choice along with your preference of size and color.



Here are the colorways we will produce if we reach our goal of $5,000. So all supporters please help us unlock this great new style (early August 2016 delivery).

Risks and challenges

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am Emma Clark, and I started MaxCleavage.com back in the year 2000, when it was simply impossible to find any comfortable stylish gel filled bras that would boost your cleavage and your confidence.</p>
<p>I had lots of friends with bigger boobs, and I lacked the confidence to wear figure hugging dresses when going out, or gym wear when working out. Now after 20 years experience designing and manufacturing bras and swimwear here in the UK, I know that these days, things are a little different…</p>
<p>There are many bras on the market but we want to produce our best ever plunge bra, available in 3 colours, black, white and nude!</p>
<p>We’ve looked at lots of prototypes, sampled fabrics, gel pads, underwires and more and we know that we’ve come up with our best design yet, ideal for all outfit dilemmas!  The most comfortable, technologically advanced liquid filled plunge bra on the market today, based on 20 years of design improvements.</p>
<p>The Atomic WOW is now ready to go into production, so please join our campaign today and bring this bra to life!</p>

I am Emma Clark, and I started MaxCleavage.com back in the year 2000, when it was simply impossible to find any comfortable stylish gel filled bras that would boost your cleavage and your confidence.

There are many bras on the market but we want to produce our best ever plunge bra, available in 3 colours, black, white and nude!

<h3>Doyen® – A celebration of British culture and legacy</h3>
<div>
<p>Introducing Doyen® - a new lifestyle brand steeped in the rich legacy of Great Britain. </p>
<p>There are few countries today that can claim to have shaped the world in which we live like Great Britain.  The nation’s dogged determination has led to some of the greatest advancements and achievements in science, industry, culture, civil society, discovery, exploration, even the arts and philosophy the world has ever known, earning her the respect and endearment of millions the world over.</p>
<p>Strength, determination, attitude, pride, grace, dignity and a sense of the fitness of things: these are the defining characteristics of Britain and her people, and the character that our team has set out to capture in one, unmistakably British brand that we call Doyen®.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508460190/ji019md030vomucncehm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>Big Ben by Doyen® - the first in a series of limited-edition timepieces.  For gents and ladies.  </h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>The symbol of perseverance</strong></i> </p>
</div>
<p>For more than 150 years, 'Big Ben', officially The Elizabeth Tower, has truly been 'the world's clock.'  Located at the Palace of Westminster, Big Ben is possibly the most famous landmark in London and England.  </p>
<p>A British cultural icon, Big Ben is universally recognized across the globe, often used as the establishing shot in motion pictures to indicate a scene's location in London.</p>
<p>But Big Ben is more than a famous landmark.  The clock tower has also served to symbolize the continued functioning of the British government and way of life, even during Britain's darkest hours.  Indeed, Big Ben represents the very essence of Britain - which is why Doyen® chose the symbolic clocktower as the inspiration for the first in our series of iconic British timepieces.</p>

However, her only option was to buy shoes for women 4 times her age which were not only inappropriate adult styles, but were also just frumpy.</p><p>By taking matters into our own hands, we decided it was time to create our own brand after unsuccessfully trying to find styles we loved online or on the high street.  With the average women shoe size being a 6UK, its quite baffling how most brands ignore the huge demand for fashionable and affordable shoe for women who are not average.

However, her only option was to buy shoes for women 4 times her age which were not only inappropriate adult styles, but were also just frumpy.By taking matters into our own hands, we decided it was time to create our own brand after unsuccessfully trying to find styles we loved online or on the high street.  With the average women shoe size being a 6UK, its quite baffling how most brands ignore the huge demand for fashionable and affordable shoe for women who are not average. Nevertheless, we decided to take on the task!Within 6 short months we have achieved a lot! From creating our Instagram and Twitter and launching our web mailing list to completing 3 photoshoots and signing a media partnership with the global hospitality group ‘Nobu’ with whom we shot our debut collection at their first European hotel in Shoreditch, London.In September, our Founder Omolara and Brand Strategist Esmé who is 6’ft 1 and wears a size 9UK travelled to our factory in China to finalise the first collection and start production to ensure we can be ready to launch for December 2017.  Image from A/W17 Campaign Our MissionHeels and the City (HATC) is the ultimate online shoe shopping destination that caters for women like yourself, size UK 7 - UK 11.Our name was created with the idea that a good pair of shoes can make you feel confident in any situation and in any city.From the long day in the office closing that new client account to partying the night away on ladies night, we want you to feel gorgeous and empowered at all times regardless of having a larger shoe size.Here at HATC we are also looking to change the conversation and stigma around women having a larger shoe size. We spoke to over 400 women and the issues are all the same; from media shaming to stories of being ‘size shamed’ by sales assistants in stores, the majority of women we spoke with have been made to feel ashamed and embarrassed about something that they cannot change.Images from A/W17 CampaignMany female celebrities that wear between a size 7 – 11UK shoe include Kendall Jenner, Heidi Klum, Cindy Crawford and Serena Williams Paris Hilton, Oprah, Kate Winslet, Tyra Banks, Elle Macpherson, Michelle Obama and Uma Thurman. However, celebrities can commission brands that would not normally cater to them or have made to order shoes.HATC aims to make all women with larger feet feel like a celebrity by wearing our shoes that are the latest styles and with standard and wider fittings, the perfect fit.Image from A/W17 CampaignOur Branding
The HATC Girls The quintessential HATC Girl is a woman creating her own lane and conquering the world one step at a time. She is metropolitan and a social chameleon. Her wardrobe is a mixture of brands from Zara to Balenciaga and she loves a sample sale. Spending her lunch breaks surfing the web for top celebrity gossip to power business meeting luncheons eating overpriced sandwich wraps from Pret as she climbs the career ladder. She ends Fridays meeting with friends on a rooftop for post-work drinks and weekly debrief on their dating lives, ridiculous rent prices, and of course upcoming sample sales! She is living a fast paced life in the big city and trying to balance it all to make it her own.With this in mind we wanted to create not 1 but 5 women who are not only diverse racially and represent a global community but diverse in their careers and goals so women around the world could feel represented.

<h3>Summary</h3>

The Covidisor is a Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR) protecting your entire head without hiding it.  It provides bi-directional N95 (or N100) air filtration, is light weight, comfortable to wear for extended periods, easy to put on & take off, and is beard and Face ID friendly. 
People wearing the Covidisor can work both safer and closer than otherwise, whether in the office, at school, or even socially.  The current public health requirement of face masks and 6' physical distancing when indoors has radically changed office layouts, elevator occupancy, public transit ridership, and is dissuading many from returning to offices and schools.
Imagine what can be reclaimed in the workplace and the classroom if it was safe to work closer than 6 feet.  The Covidisor aims to make that possible.
Its clear polycarbonate shell provides full visibility for and of the wearer and its bi-directional filtration protects both the wearer and others nearby.  A variable speed fan assures a comfortable stream of filtered air in the wearer's ""air bubble"" and also filters exhaled air for the safety of colleagues and co-workers.
The Covidisor is conceived and designed by architects and engineers in New York who are passionate about helping people safely work in offices, teach on campus, and socialize publicly in the time of COVID.
In this campaign, we are looking for 200 angel backers to 1) support the remaining engineering and production of the first 200 field test units; 2) to field test the Covidisor in their respective office, university, factory, and farm environments; and 3) to provide us feedback before we finalize the design and go to mass production.
Features:

Head mounted and center weighted, so it's light and balanced to wear.
Quick and easy to don/doff.  Just put it on like a hat and pull a neck strap to make it airtight.
Battery powered fan filters air in both directions, keeping you and others safe, and without breathing fatigue.
Swivel mount allows you to rotate the outer sphere while wearing, so for example to drink via a straw inserted in one of Covidisor's ports  (drinking connector provided).

 

What We Need & What You Get
We are seeking $49,000 to cover the remaining engineering work and fabrication of 200 fully functional field test units of the Covidisor.
You can back our efforts with a contribution of any amount and you can also get early access to the Covidisor via our $245 perk that gets you a fully functional ""engineering"" release unit for field testing plus first delivery of the production version at 50% discount.
The ""engineering"" release is a fully functional unit with custom 3D printed components that we can rapidly modify and send out to our angel backers based on their feedback.  We have sourced all the other parts needed for the Covidisor.
 

The Impact
We believe that the Covidisor with its transparent full head protection and bi-directional air filtering will allow:

Office and manufacturing workers to work in closer proximity than if wearing regular masks masks
Professors to teach and lecture on campus
Manufacturing and farm workers to work in closer proximity
Everyone to regain their smile and identity!

 

Risks & Challenges
We've been heads down working on the Covidisor the past two months.  There were early challenges of air flow and humidity in the sphere that we've resolved.  We are now working on optimization of the 3D printed components and connectors.  What's most needed now is user feedback from a sizable group of early adopters/backers. 
 

Other Ways You Can Help
We've priced the perk to cover the remaining engineering work and production of the first 200 test units.  If $245 is out of reach for you at the moment, but you see the potential of the Covidisor, you can help by spreading the word about the Covidisor.  
The quicker we reach our campaign goal, the quicker we get the field test units out, and in turn the quicker we finalize the design, manufacture it, and get it out at a lower price.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong><u>Mission</u></strong></h3>
<p>              XIII XI celebrates growth that is transcending. XIII XI watches are meant to remind you of the journey that you are on in life. To inspire you to define your purpose and make it definite. Our logo and watch designs are derived from sacred geometry, such as the “flower of life” pattern, which has been said to be nature’s blueprint when creating all that is matter. Our brand aims to remind you that with time comes change, and though change is inevitable, the secret is not to resist; but accept and embrace change; to grow with time.</p>
<p>              Our watches are as beautiful as they are loaded with symbology; from the name of the watches and logo to the designs; our watches are packed with significance and harmony. Though compliments are bound to happen when wearing our beautiful watches, our aim is not for you to buy them for the purpose of impression-management or superficial flexing. There comes a point in every person’s life where we have grown to the point that we shed our old selves and become something greater; unrecognizable to the old self. Like a caterpillar morphs into a butterfly. This growth is transcending, where the growth that we have made amounts to something great and becomes apparent to everyone that knew us. These are moments that mark a personal evolution. That’s what XIII XI stands for. The number 13 is symbolic of this transcended growth. For example, there are 12 musical notes in a harmonic scale, the 13th note is simply the first note vibrating at a higher frequency. The number 11 is symbolic of synchronicity, where two unrelated events coincide with each other and give us a sign that we are on the right path.  This is the meaning XIII XI (13:11), to grow with time in a transcending way.</p>
<p>              XIII XI is committed to bringing you value that is more than just tangible. Our mission is to inspire personal growth as we challenge ourselves to grow with time as well. Being pragmatic in our approach but unwavering on our mission.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong><u>COMPANY DESCRIPTION</u></strong></h3>
<p>Describe the company’s products or services. How many are there? What makes them different and unique? Why should a customer buy them?</p>
<p>              There are currently two watch series, the Sacred Geometry men’s series that comes with four dial options; and the “Fruit of Life” women’s series that also comes with the option of four different dials. All watches come with three easy to change straps, a metal strap, a silicone strap, and a leather band; each strap changes the look drastically and provides an array of options to match all your moods and go with any occasion. The watch cases are made with a durable 316L stainless steel and a swiss quartz movement. They are 50 meters water-resistant and come with an option of a dome sapphire crystal or a flat sapphire crystal with a magnifier over the date window. They are presented in a beautiful and unique book that makes for a great gift.</p>
<p>              Each watch is named after esoteric knowledge such as universal laws that govern the universe and consciousness itself. We not only aim to sell watches but more importantly aim to use our brand to bring awareness to the power that we all have when we fix our minds on the attainment of our dreams and work in a definite way to attain them. We want our watches to remind you of that journey that you are on and to inspire you to grow with time and not to drift away from your dreams.</p>
<p>Watches come in a unique box that is inspired by an ancient book. </p>

Like a caterpillar morphs into a butterfly. This growth is transcending, where the growth that we have made amounts to something great and becomes apparent to everyone that knew us. These are moments that mark a personal evolution. That’s what XIII XI stands for. The number 13 is symbolic of this transcended growth. For example, there are 12 musical notes in a harmonic scale, the 13th note is simply the first note vibrating at a higher frequency. The number 11 is symbolic of synchronicity, where two unrelated events coincide with each other and give us a sign that we are on the right path.  This is the meaning XIII XI (13:11), to grow with time in a transcending way.
              XIII XI is committed to bringing you value that is more than just tangible. Our mission is to inspire personal growth as we challenge ourselves to grow with time as well. Being pragmatic in our approach but unwavering on our mission.

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Nicole Locorriere (LA-core-AIR-ah. I know, I know) and I'm an Associate Marriage and Family Therapist in New Jersey.</p>
<p>So, an MFT doesn't necessarily only see couples and families. Really, it means we're specially trained to see problems as a result of how we relate to the world (+people) around us. This puts me in the unique position of deeply understanding the effect STIGMA has on society.</p>
<p>Stigma is a negative perception about someone or something that makes people think it/they have less value, even if it's a baseless stereotype. And there's a HUGE stigma around going to therapy right now. People believe you only go if there's something wrong with you, or you need fixing. But I know, as do you, my dear Potential-Backer-and-New-Favorite-Human, that <strong>everyone can benefit from therapy. </strong>The more we shout this message from the rooftops, the more people will feel comfortable getting the help and validation they deserve.</p>
<p>By backing my Spill The Tea bags, you'll be doing three amazing things. First, simply carrying the bag around in public shows everyone around you that <strong>it's okay to talk about therapy. </strong>Second, 25% of the profit from your bag will go to To Write Love on Her Arms, a mental health organization that, among other things, gives people access to therapy. Third, you get to show off how cool you are, knowing what the kids these days are saying.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Stigma has left the chat.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>I believe doing this project the right way will cost about $4,000. Here's a breakdown of how I'll use it. I will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay my awesome designer, Lara, who is currently working on an original design for us.</li>
<li>Make promo bags to give away to influencers, local businesses, etc.</li>
<li>Purchase a trademark.<i> (I'd love for others to get into stigma-busting design, but if a bunch of people try to take this phrase and run with it, nobody wins)</i>
</li>
<li>Have capital for the first bunch of bags that go out to customers</li>
<li>Have an emergency fund for unforeseen circumstances. Call it a first-time founder fee!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>If I don't reach this goal, the funds will go toward making sure those who ordered bags still receive them. </p>
<p>If there turns out to be EXTRA funding, it will be donated straight to TWLOHA or the organization we are working with at that time. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Ooh, the fun part!</p>
<p>Spill The Tea bags are not simply another bag that proves how #woke you are. (Even though its true, and you're awesome for it!) The real impact comes from the fact that we'll be donating a portion of the profit to mental health organizations that are really making a difference in the field. However, I plan to do this in a unique way to benefit as many organizations as possible. </p>
<p>For every 100 bags sold, I will change the organization based on who YOU choose. Do you know a mental health organization that really deserves some love? Let's add it to the list! <strong>The more you share the bag, the more organizations we can get through!</strong></p>
<p>We'll be starting with my favorite mental health organization, <strong>To Write Love on Her Arms.</strong> </p>
<p>TWLOHA is a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping those who struggle with depression, addiction, self-harm, and suicide. Since they got started in 2006, <strong>they have donated over $2 MILLION to help people get access to mental health treatment.</strong> They also fight stigma like it's their JOB (oh, wait...). They have a presence on college campuses all across the country, and they're getting started on high schools now. They have also travelled over 3 million collective miles meeting people in their communities to offer help and validation. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please leave me a comment with other organizations you'd like to see receive a Spill The Tea donation!</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Honesty and transparency are a big chunk of a therapist's work. We must be honest with ourselves so our clients feel comfortable being honest with us. The same goes for this project. I would never expect you to feel comfortable giving me your hard-earned money without being honest about risks you may face.</p>
<p>The most obvious challenge I face in making Spill The Tea bags is that I'm a first-time founder. I've never tried to sell a product, and I've never run a crowdfunding campaign. In that way, this whole project is a bit of a risk. However, <strong>the strongest defense I have against that risk is your support and constructive feedback. </strong>The bigger and more close-knit our community, the more we can accomplish.</p>
<p>You may notice that I also added wiggle-room in my financial goal to cover expenses I wasn't initially aware of. I have also given us way more time than I think we'll need to get to the production and shipping stages. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I totally understand if you don't have the money to financially support Spill The Tea bags right now. <strong>You can still help us along though! </strong>Someone on your Facebook timeline, Twitter feed, or Instagram feed is as #woke as you, with a slightly thicker wallet ;)</p>
<p>Indiegogo has handy-dandy share tools that make it really easy to make some noise! Hit 'em all like a little kid in an elevator. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Truly, thank you from the bottom of my heart for backing this project. You're doing amazing, sweetie. </p>
