<h3>The Facts We Live With</h3>
<div>The first fact is located below from an article composed due to an experiment conducted.</div>
<div><b>Abstract:</b></div>
<div>
<p>Emergency medical services (EMS) administrators seek methods to enhance system performance. One component scrutinized is the response time (RT) interval between call receipt and arrival on scene. While reducing RTs may improve survival, this remains speculative and unreported.</p>
<div><b>Objective:</b></div>
<p>To determine the effect of current RTs on survival in an urban EMS system.</p>
<div><b>Method:</b></div>
<p>The study was conducted in a metropolitan county (population 620,000). The EMS system is a single-tier, paramedic service and provides all service requests. The 90% fractile RT specifications required for county compliance include 10:59 minutes for emergency life-threatening calls (priority I) and 12:59 minutes for emergency non-life-threatening calls (priority II). All emergency responses resulting in a priority I or priority II transport to a Level 1 trauma center emergency department over a six-month period were evaluated to determine the relation between specified and arbitrarily assigned RTs and survival.</p>
<div><b>Results:</b></div>
<p>Five thousand, four hundred twenty-four transports were reviewed. Of these, 71 patients did not survive (1.31%; 95% CI = 1.04% to 1.67%). No significant difference in median RTs between survivors (6.4 min) and nonsurvivors (6.8 min) was noted (p = 0.10). Further, there was no significant difference between observed and expected deaths (p = 0.14). However, mortality risk was 1.58% for patients whose RT exceeded 5 minutes, and 0.51% for those whose RT was under 5 minutes (p = 0.002). The mortality risk curve was generally flat over RT intervals exceeding 5 minutes.</p>
<div><b>Conclusion:</b></div>
<p>In this observational study, emergency calls where RTs were less than 5 minutes were associated with improved survival when compared with calls where RTs exceeded 5 minutes. While variables other than time may be associated with this improved survival, there is little evidence in these data to suggest that changing this system's response time specifications to times less than current, but greater than 5 minutes, would have any beneficial effect on survival.</p>
</div>Below is an informational fact from a news article.</div>
<div>
<p>""Help came too late for Julia Rusinek. The 21-year-old Yale sociology student, an accomplished runner, collapsed on a busy street corner in the nation's capital on a summer evening in 1999 after working out at a nearby gym.</p>
<p>Rusinek had more than a fighting chance to live: She was healthy except for a hidden condition that caused a sudden electrical short circuit in her heart. Her heart needed a zap — within six minutes — from a common medical device known as a defibrillator. Bystanders saw her fall, rushed to help and immediately called 911.</p>
<p>But Rusinek's life ticked away on the corner where she fell. Twelve minutes passed before an ambulance crew connected a defibrillator to her chest. Like thousands of others every year in cities across the country, Rusinek lost any chance she had to survive because of an emergency medical system that consistently fails to save as many lives as it should. </p>
<p>A survey and data analysis show that, of the 250,000 Americans who die outside of hospitals from cardiac arrest each year, between 58,000 and 76,000 suffer from a treatable short circuit in the heart and therefore are highly ""saveable."" Yet nationwide, emergency medical systems save only a small fraction of saveable victims, and rates vary widely from city to city.</p>
<p>The analysis shows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The chance of surviving a dire medical emergency in the USA is a matter of geography. If you collapse from cardiac arrest in Seattle, a 911 call likely will bring instant advice and fast-moving firefighters and paramedics. Collapse in Washington, D.C., and — as one EMS official suggests — someone better call a cab for you. Seattle saves 45% of saveable victims like Rusinek; Washington, D.C., has no idea how many victims like Rusinek it saves. The city estimates it saves 4% of cardiac arrests, but inconsistent record-keeping makes it impossible for Washington to account accurately for its most saveable victims.</li>
<li>In the nation's 50 largest cities, about 9,000 people collapse each year from cardiac arrest caused by a short circuit in the heart. Only an estimated 6% to 10%, or as few as 540, are rescued. If every major city increased its save rate to 20%, as a number of cities have done, a total of 1,800 lives could be saved every year.""</li>

<br/><p><b>THE STORY OF OUR CEO:</b> Hi. I’m Arianna, the inventor, owner and CEO of Bodacious Cases. My idea all started with a ziplock baggie.</p>
<p>                                                     <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1432335/files/20150501072638-ziploc_baggie.jpg?1430490398"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; width: 213px; height: 213px; background-color: initial;""/></p>
<p> I was in a hot tub on the 4th of July at a family get together when I thought I lost my phone, meaning I lost my calendar, business contacts, pictures, everything. My family and I used to use ziploc baggies to protect our phones around water. I thought there has to be better way to protect my phone so the next day I started looking for a case that was water-resistant, durable; something that wasn’t bulky and could slide easily in and out of my pocket. I wanted a case that would hold an I.D. and credit cards. Something that would match my outfits and that was American made. Nope, couldn’t find what I wanted in just one case, so I told my mom I was going to invent one.</p>
<p>I used to Skype at night with manufacturers overseas and search by day for an American manufacturer. I was looking for that one company that believed in me and what I was doing.</p>
<p>SO many people told me what I wanted to do wasn’t doable and if it was all the big companies would have already done it. They said that if I wanted to stay Made in America I would NOT succeed. They said in order for me to succeed I’d have to manufacture my products overseas. I followed my dreams, didn’t give up, and kept my products American made.</p>

<p>American made is important to me for many reasons. While serving in Vietnam my father was wounded and came really close to dying and lost several of his fellow comrades. I feel I owe it to them to keep my products made here, because without their sacrifice I wouldn’t have the freedom to choose where my products are being made.

Each case comes with an interchangeable band in the color of your choice to mix and match your style.                                                                  CASE- FEATURES

   
                                          
FACT: Everyone's phone needs protection......Did you know that every 2 seconds someone accidentally breaks their phone? You’re 10x more likely to break your phone than lose it or have it stolen.

Yes, there's thousands of other phone cases out there, so what makes The Band-It Case by Bodacious Cases different?
Bodacious Cases allows you to ditch your bulky purse or wallet for a protective, durable, sleek, thin, stylish, customizable case that you can carry an I.D., two credit cards and or business cards in, and at a competitive price. Don’t forget that it’s Made in America. Proudly NOT made in China! :)

                                 
We want to raise $30,000 to begin the expansion of our product line to the iPhone 6 and Samsung Galaxy s5. Our goal is to reach $200,000 to fully expand our product line to include the new Samsung Galaxy s6, plus I (Arianna) as the CEO will go audition for Shark Tank! :)

FACT: One of our goals is to create 100 local jobs in the community and surrounding areas by December 3, 2016. We can’t do it without your help.
        




We don’t just manufacture our products here. We try to buy everything from our     t-shirts, packaging, business cards, stickers, the bubble shipping envelope that protects your case while being shipped to your door. We try to support local and American made businesses EVERY chance we get!

We offer up to 10 case colors and 12 easily interchangeable band colors so you can customize your case to match your different outfits, sports team, business or charity. 6 case colors for the iPhone 4/4s and 10 colors for all other cases.
            
CamBo Product Description: In January 2014 we launched our line of camouflage cases called “CamBo”. The three front and back case designs are real photos taken at Bodacious Cases Headquarters located on a Missouri Century Farm; which was homesteaded in 1824 by the CEO’s great-great-grandparents.
All other competitor’s camouflage cases are digitized photos and are only on the back of the case, where ours are real photos, on the front and back.

With the Band-It Case you can build your own Bo case. Our cases allow you to have a case that is all one solid color, or a case that is up to 3 different colors. Choose your own front, back and band color.
Our cases are reg. $35-59.95. ONLY in this crowdfunding campaign will you see prices so low, it'll make your jaw drop! 
Save up to 50% off now ONLY on our crowdfunding campaign.




                           With the Band-It Case you can match your style by purchasing extra interchangeable bands.


                    
                        Thousands of you have asked us to expand our product line, therefore we need your help to launch the new and improved Bo Case (2.0) With changes to the security lever, a softer home button and on/of button, stronger ports and an added layer of protection on the inside. We are currently raising funds to expand to the iPhone 6, Samsung Galaxy s5 & 6.(Please note that the iPhone 4/4s, 5 & 5s will NOT be the new and improved Bo case 2.0 and will NOT include the extra layer of protection or any other changes, but will still offer you ultimate protection, when you drop your phone.)                                                     Bo was born on the 4th of July, but what are we celebrating when we depend on other countries to make all of our products? Together we can make a difference, and it all starts here, with a Bo case.

Lets wrap your China made phone with an All-American made case. Together we can make a difference one Bo case at a time.
Help us reach our goal of $30,000 so we can expand to the iPhone 6 and Samsung Galaxy s5.  When we reach $200,000, we will begin manufacturing the Samsung Galaxy s6.
Don’t forget to share this campaign on your social media pages and also email it to your friends, family and co-workers. Without your help we can’t expand our product line! So please MOVE THAT MOUSE NOW go to the campaign and back us by donating. Every penny helps!
Thank you for your help! Have a bodacious day!

<p>We would like to take a moment to introduce the minds behind StickR TrackR.</p>
<p>StickR TrackR was developed by Phone Halo, a Santa Barbara, CA based start up company. The company was founded by Chris Herbert and Christian Smith, two UC Santa Barbara graduates who met during their college years.</p>
<p>The idea for StickR TrackR began when Chris and Christian noticed how frequently they misplaced their TV remote and keys. They realized they weren't the only ones with this problem. After much brainstorming, their goal was to design a simple and seamless solution to prevent the problem of misplacing important items. StickR TrackR was created to be the smallest and most innovative solution to date. </p>
<p>StickR TrackR is not Phone Halo's first attempt at item finding technology. <a href=""http://www.wallettrackr.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wallet TrackR</a>, <a href=""http://www.cobratag.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cobra Tag</a>, and <a href=""http://www.audiovoxproducts.com/anti-separation-alarm/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">inSite</a> are enjoyed by thousands. Phone Halo has consistently delivered products promptly to customers with the highest quality possible. StickR TrackR technology &amp; Crowd Source Tracking technology was created during the Launch 2013 Hackathon Event.</p>

About Us

We would like to take a moment to introduce the minds behind StickR TrackR.
StickR TrackR was developed by Phone Halo, a Santa Barbara, CA based start up company. The company was founded by Chris Herbert and Christian Smith, two UC Santa Barbara graduates who met during their college years.
The idea for StickR TrackR began when Chris and Christian noticed how frequently they misplaced their TV remote and keys. They realized they weren't the only ones with this problem. After much brainstorming, their goal was to design a simple and seamless solution to prevent the problem of misplacing important items. StickR TrackR was created to be the smallest and most innovative solution to date. 
StickR TrackR is not Phone Halo's first attempt at item finding technology. Wallet TrackR, Cobra Tag, and inSite are enjoyed by thousands. Phone Halo has consistently delivered products promptly to customers with the highest quality possible. StickR TrackR technology & Crowd Source Tracking technology was created during the Launch 2013 Hackathon Event.

How does StickR TrackR help me locate my lost items?
StickR TrackR helps you find your lost items in 3 ways:

Yes. To make searching for your items even easier, the app contains a hot/cold distance indicator that shows you when you are getting closer to your StickR TrackR as well as a Google map of where you left it.

1) Bidirectional Protection: Find your item using your phone or find your phone using your StickR TrackR Device

3) Crowd Source Tracking: Technology that allows users to locate their items after they have been lost

Absolutely! Our Item TrackR app can work with StickNFind Devices, inRange Devices, Bluetooth Cars, headsets, and more!
Is the device water resistant?

<h2><span>A true story...</span></h2>
<h2> </h2>
<p>GANGA is a toy for families. Created by a father who wanted to answer his child’s question when she asked him what he did: How could he describe his work as a programmer to a child? What is a Programme? <span style=""font-size: 10px;"">So Paolo built a small app on his new smartphone, a little bear who needed to be cared for, to demonstrate what he did and GANGA was born. As time went on GANGA brought Paolo and his daughter closer. He was able, via this little bear, to not just shine a little more clarity for his daughter into his working life, but to also into his life as a parent.</span></p>
<p>In learning how to care for her little GANGA, Paolo’s daughter started to understand why her father asked her to brush her teeth at night, because if her GANGA didn’t do it, his happiness levels decreased. Likewise for bedtime, when she put her GANGA to bed in time she saw his happiness levels increase and he began to grow up. When one night Paolo asked his daughter if GANGA might need to go to bed now, she looked up and replied, yes. I think I should to. I want to have full happiness levels tomorrow! <span style=""font-size: 10px;"">Gradually Paolo realised that just maybe, what had been a toy to help bring him and his daughter close, may be something that might help other parents like him.</span></p>

Ladies and Gentleman, Mothers and Fathers, boys and girls, sons and daughters…ITS gANGA TIME!
Our project goal is to complete gANGA. Ganga is a hybrid between toy,  interaction design, internet of things, smartphone/tablet app game and social network.Aimed at a wide target audience, at the heart of gANGA is the parent-child relationship which is developed through the little bear and its virtual world.

The project employs a mix of advanced technology, linking the virtual with the physical and encouraging communication through both the physical and emotional. 


Ganga is a teddy bear, connected to an app which communicated to tablets and smartphones. Children can take care of their Ganga teddy bear and also follow their little bear's growth, together with the parent, who can guide the little bears future with their children, through the app on their mobile. 

Follow your gANGA's progress, help them grow, write a diary with pictures of their experiences and share it with others! 

Ganga also enables parents to have an overview of how their child is caring for their gANGA teddy bear. Sensors, installed within the little teddy bear itself, communicate with the app of the parent's smart phone or tablet, so parents can open the app and see when their child is craddling ganga or when they are playing with him.  

How is this possible? An array of sensors (accelerometer, vibration, tilt) are fitted internally within the gANGA soft toy. These enable the app to receive positional data from the toy itself to their smart phone or tablet. Via the gANGA app the little bear on the screen in front of them will be moving as the child moves their soft toy.

What is a Programme? So Paolo built a small app on his new smartphone, a little bear who needed to be cared for, to demonstrate what he did and GANGA was born. As time went on GANGA brought Paolo and his daughter closer. He was able, via this little bear, to not just shine a little more clarity for his daughter into his working life, but to also into his life as a parent.
In learning how to care for her little GANGA, Paolo’s daughter started to understand why her father asked her to brush her teeth at night, because if her GANGA didn’t do it, his happiness levels decreased. Likewise for bedtime, when she put her GANGA to bed in time she saw his happiness levels increase and he began to grow up. When one night Paolo asked his daughter if GANGA might need to go to bed now, she looked up and replied, yes. I think I should to. I want to have full happiness levels tomorrow! Gradually Paolo realised that just maybe, what had been a toy to help bring him and his daughter close, may be something that might help other parents like him.

<em>What</em> is the SUPERBUMPER and <em>Why</em> is it so SUPER?</h1>
<div> </div>
<p><strong><em>What</em> is the SUPERBUMPER?:</strong>  The SUPERBUMPER is a type of case, or bumper to be exact, that fits around the edges of your iDevice to add a dash of style, protection, and a whole new <em>super</em> feature that cases and bumpers haven't seen before.  The SUPERBUMPER consists of a soft, silicone rubber interior lining that acts as a shock absorption medium, molded together with a hard plastic outer shell for greater protection, strength, and support. </p>
<p><strong><em>Why</em> is it SUPER?: </strong>The SUPERBUMPER is super because, well, it was designed to be.  With it's patent pending functionality, no other bumper on the market can, or will be able to, do what it can do.  The SUPERBUMPER's new feature, dubbed the ""cord management slit,"" holds your charger and other Apple Dock Connector cables to the device, eliminating the possibility of them becoming accidentally disconnected.  This means: </p>
<ul>
<li>No more damaged and loose connections because the cable gets ripped out.  </li>
<li>No more having your 'tunes' cut out when driving because the am/fm tuner cable popped out.  </li>
<li>No more dirt, dust, and debris getting into the device's 30-pin dock connector and messing with the connection.  </li>
<li>No more waking to find your device's battery not charged because your pets bumped it in the middle of the night, or if you're like me, you rolled over on it while sleeping and disconnected the cord.  </li>
<li>And no more panicking because your device became disconnected during an updating or restoring session.</li>
</ul><p style=""margin-left: 180px;""><em>NO MORE CHARGING ISSUES!</em></p>
<p>In addition to the ""cord management slit"" <em>and</em> the superior protection received from the rubber lining and the hard outer shell, the SUPERBUMPER was designed with a slight lip to keep the front and back glass from touching the surfaces when resting.  This reduces the risk of scratches and cracks, helping keep it unblemished even longer.</p>

<h1>
<em>When </em>was this invented... and <em>how</em>?</h1>
<p><strong>When &amp; How: </strong>I came up with the initial concept for the SUPERBUMPER at the end February of 2012.  For the year and a half prior to coming up with this idea, I was traveling a lot between Syracuse, NY, Boston, MA, and Olean/Portville, NY.  During those many miles in my vehicle, I always used my AM/FM TuneBase to listen to my music in the car.  After continually grabbing and moving my iPhone to change the song and it sliding around because of the turns and me having to replug it back in, the AM/FM turner cable started to have a bad connection with my iPhone.  It became too loose.  My music started to cut in and out, and would turn off whenever I hit a bump.  I then realized that if I held the cable into the iPhone tightly, the issue was fixed.  So I did what any normal person would do... I bent the cable and would put anything heavy I had in the car on top of it to keep it in position and not get disconnected.  Fast forward about a year to Feb. 2012 and it hit me... I could make my own case that actually solved this problem and a few others.  I realized this isn't the only situation where having a case that holds your Apple Dock Connector snugly to the phone would be beneficial. </p>
<p>So at the end of February, with only an idea and a dream, I got to work.  First, I started doing research on whether or not there were any products like this on the market (one that held the dock connector cable to the device) and whether or not it was a patentable.  Second, I started drawing some very basic sketches and concept visualizations.  </p>
<p><img alt=""Proof-of-Concept Prototypes"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/124/697/b7960e6740c26bf28aff23e487f54374_large.JPG?1345595537"" src="""" style=""""/>Proof-of-Concept Prototypes</p>
<p>When I became satisfied with the uniqueness of product and realized it was patentable, I got to work building rough, basic prototypes made from cloth, plastic, rubber, and anything I could find that would do the job.  </p>
<p>After that, I started meeting with lawyers, design firms, investors, manufacturing/packaging companies, and doing market research.  I had the provisional patent filed, hired a design team to develop the final models, started pricing final unit costs, and worked on other essential, and boring, business things that needed to be taken care of.  </p>
<p>And that's where we are now.</p>
<h1>What color combinations will you have?</h1>
<p>The SUPERBUMPER prototypes will be produced in black/dark grey, black/ lime green, and white/grey (two of which are shown, one above and below).</p>

<h1>What's next &amp; Why do you need my help?</h1>
<p>We need your help because in order to get the SUPERBUMPER into full production and to the market, we're going to need top off our buget with an additional $5k to get the production run going.  Your money goes directly towards the cost of the tooling/manufacturing and nothing else.  Needless to say, I can't thank you enough for your support!  You rock!</p>
<p>Once the campaign has ended, I will contact you with what color combination and what iPhone SUPERBUMPER you want, 4/4S or 5.</p>

What is the SUPERBUMPER?:  The SUPERBUMPER is a type of case, or bumper to be exact, that fits around the edges of your iDevice to add a dash of style, protection, and a whole new super feature that cases and bumpers haven't seen before.  The SUPERBUMPER consists of a soft, silicone rubber interior lining that acts as a shock absorption medium, molded together with a hard plastic outer shell for greater protection, strength, and support. 
Why is it SUPER?: The SUPERBUMPER is super because, well, it was designed to be.  With it's patent pending functionality, no other bumper on the market can, or will be able to, do what it can do.  The SUPERBUMPER's new feature, dubbed the ""cord management slit,"" holds your charger and other Apple Dock Connector cables to the device, eliminating the possibility of them becoming accidentally disconnected.  This means: 

No more damaged and loose connections because the cable gets ripped out.  
No more having your 'tunes' cut out when driving because the am/fm tuner cable popped out.  
No more dirt, dust, and debris getting into the device's 30-pin dock connector and messing with the connection.  
No more waking to find your device's battery not charged because your pets bumped it in the middle of the night, or if you're like me, you rolled over on it while sleeping and disconnected the cord.  
And no more panicking because your device became disconnected during an updating or restoring session.
NO MORE CHARGING ISSUES!
In addition to the ""cord management slit"" and the superior protection received from the rubber lining and the hard outer shell, the SUPERBUMPER was designed with a slight lip to keep the front and back glass from touching the surfaces when resting.  This reduces the risk of scratches and cracks, helping keep it unblemished even longer.

iPad SUPERBUMPER

When was this invented... and how?
When & How: I came up with the initial concept for the SUPERBUMPER at the end February of 2012.  For the year and a half prior to coming up with this idea, I was traveling a lot between Syracuse, NY, Boston, MA, and Olean/Portville, NY.  During those many miles in my vehicle, I always used my AM/FM TuneBase to listen to my music in the car.  After continually grabbing and moving my iPhone to change the song and it sliding around because of the turns and me having to replug it back in, the AM/FM turner cable started to have a bad connection with my iPhone.  It became too loose.  My music started to cut in and out, and would turn off whenever I hit a bump.  I then realized that if I held the cable into the iPhone tightly, the issue was fixed.  So I did what any normal person would do... I bent the cable and would put anything heavy I had in the car on top of it to keep it in position and not get disconnected.  Fast forward about a year to Feb. 2012 and it hit me... I could make my own case that actually solved this problem and a few others.  I realized this isn't the only situation where having a case that holds your Apple Dock Connector snugly to the phone would be beneficial. 
So at the end of February, with only an idea and a dream, I got to work.  First, I started doing research on whether or not there were any products like this on the market (one that held the dock connector cable to the device) and whether or not it was a patentable.  Second, I started drawing some very basic sketches and concept visualizations.  
Proof-of-Concept Prototypes
When I became satisfied with the uniqueness of product and realized it was patentable, I got to work building rough, basic prototypes made from cloth, plastic, rubber, and anything I could find that would do the job.  
After that, I started meeting with lawyers, design firms, investors, manufacturing/packaging companies, and doing market research.  I had the provisional patent filed, hired a design team to develop the final models, started pricing final unit costs, and worked on other essential, and boring, business things that needed to be taken care of.  
And that's where we are now.
What color combinations will you have?
The SUPERBUMPER prototypes will be produced in black/dark grey, black/ lime green, and white/grey (two of which are shown, one above and below).

What's next & Why do you need my help?
We need your help because in order to get the SUPERBUMPER into full production and to the market, we're going to need top off our buget with an additional $5k to get the production run going.  Your money goes directly towards the cost of the tooling/manufacturing and nothing else.  Needless to say, I can't thank you enough for your support!  You rock!
Once the campaign has ended, I will contact you with what color combination and what iPhone SUPERBUMPER you want, 4/4S or 5.

<p><b>What does the Octopus
tail stand for?</b>
</p>
<p>The design concept of
the Octopus Tail has been inspired by the octopus and its arms' absorptive
power. The strong point of
this product is the double sided construction of the sucker cups that allows
the user to attach it to various objects such
as mobile phones, tablets, memo pads etc. and then remove them without
difficulty. The users can easily
cut it into smaller pieces with scissors and then use it according to their
needs. It's an innovative
product that presents the animal that cannot be omitted when talking about
Korea.</p>
<p><b>Design Background</b></p>
<p>We are surrounded by countless products. The digitization is progressing, the number of smartphone users increasing. As the market is expanding there are more and more new
accessories being developed. However, most of these products can only be used in one way, whereas our goal was to
create an accessory that could be easily and comfortably used in various everyday life
situations. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Design
Goal</b></p>
<p>- The functionality should be included even in the smallest part of the future
product</p>
<p>- It has to take into consideration the user’s environment</p>
<p>- The designed product should be fun</p>
<p>- The future product has to be free from deformation</p>
<p>- The product has to be easily adaptable to the changing environment</p>

<p>My name is Stipe Splivalo (37) and I live in Zagreb, Croatia. I work as a web designer and have been in interactive design and media industry for 15 years. I use wheelchair and I often have problems entering buildings like cinema, coffee shops, restaurants and many other places that should be available for everyone.</p>
<p>Two years ago I was on my trip to Amsterdam and it was virtually impossible to plan my sightseeing. I had no accessibility info and all available data was from people who does not understand my condition so lots of “accessible places” like Madame Tussaud’s weren't really accessible for me. Museum was very crowded and I had problems entering and moving around with my wheelchair. I didn't see anything and I could hardly wait to get out. It would be great if I could read a review by someone with similar condition that has been on that spot and reviewed it as place that should be visited on less crowded day.</p>
<p>I called 2 of my friends and said ""Let's make it"".  Soon after we started a project ""travabled.com"" - world without barriers, which is most important project I've been working in my career and I would really like to see it spread worldwide, to serve and help the global community of disabled travelers.</p>

The Achilles heel of current offerings is that they are disjointed and independent of one another. Consumer take up will be significantly enhanced due to Spend's universal solution.</p><p>With a single login to the Spend app and web interface consumers are provided with a single view of all offers, rewards, vouchers and receipts, along with the delivery of real time offers direct to the smartphone or tablet. Spend further provides advanced features such as expense management and user led control over the marketing that they receive.</p><p>The same research* reveals that trust is an issue. Grocery stores are the most trusted 68%, then loyalty card providers 58%, brands are only trusted by 32% and 24% wouldn't trust any of the above. Spend will give the consumer control over their account allowing us to increase the level of trust benefiting both the consumer and retailer alike.</p><p>Contributing to spend is much more than just handing over cash - by contributing to the Spend Campaign you will of course help us raise the required £150,000 but you also send a powerful message to the retailer that you, the consumers, are ready to spend with Spend by your side. Spend will be free to end users and contributors can choose Perks giving them access to Spend Plus at reduced rates.</p><p>So please get contributing or read on for much more detail on Spend and how we aim to change the world of loyalty offers and receipts. Don't forget to share the campaign with friends and colleagues to take advantage of our referral cash back offer - if your referrals raise £500+ we'll refund your contribution up to a maximum of £50!</p><h3>The Spend Approach...</h3><p>So how does Spend approach this for the benefit of both the customer and the retailer? Quite simply, it puts everything in one place giving the following top level benefits:</p><p><b>Spend for the Customer</b></p><ul>
<li>
<b>Simple - </b>all receipts and rewards in one easy to use Spend account. </li>
<li>
<b>Keep - </b>track of spending, receipts, expenses and rewards.</li>
<li>
<b>Instant -</b> rewards, receive time and location specific offers and rewards tailored to your buying habits. </li>
</ul><p><b>Spend for the Retailer</b></p><ul>
<li>
<b>Open - </b>a dialogue with the customer via their Spend account</li>
<li>
<b>See - </b>a single view of customers, understand their habits and expectations.</li>
<li>
<b>Drive - </b>repeat business through powerful insights and tailored offers.</li>
</ul><p><b>Spend for the Environment</b></p><ul>
<li>
<b>Save - </b> Trees, Spend helps reduce the amount paper used for receipts.</li>
<li>
<b>Clean - </b>the streets. No more litter, everything is safe and secure online.</li>
</ul><h3>
<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>Hasn't this been done before?</b></b><br/>
</h3><p></p><p>No - not taking the approach Spend takes. Some retailers have removed paper receipts from the point of sale, for example Apple. However, overall the take up has been poor for the following reasons.</p><p></p><ol>
<li>Existing solutions deliver receipts to customers via the retailers existing web and or mobile platforms. This results in customers having to visit multiple sites/apps to view receipts rather than a unified interface.</li>
<li>As an alternative to the above, some retailers have elected to email receipts to their customers. Email was designed for communication, not as a digital filing system which makes it harder to manage receipts adding little value to the retailer or the customer.</li>
<li>Lack of inertia, the above adds little value to the customer, reducing demand.</li>
</ol><p>Our approach is different, Spend delivers everything for the retailer and customer in one central, easy to use, hosted solution.</p><p><br/></p><p><b style=""font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;""></b></p><p><b style=""font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/542250/files/20140429072021-SPEND_Data_Flow_Schematic_1.png?1398781221"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p><b style=""font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;""><br/></b><p></p><p><b style=""font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">Who's behind Spend?</b><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Spend was founded by Freddie Alston </span><span style=""line-height: 23px;"">who's</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> background is firmly routed in data management services.

Spend needs to be built before it can catch on, so please dig deep and make a contribution that will change the way we shop. You can give as much or a little (from £1) as you like and if you want something other than Spend in return, chose a perk.  </p><p>After securing the funding, we've a lot to do. From building the team, developing systems and software, integration with existing point of sale solutions, getting retailers on board plus the less exciting legal matters and so forth. </p><p>The £150K goal of this project will get things started nicely, enabling us to build a platform that is fundamentally operational and ready to implement in retailers. The major costs come from development, testing, integration and security, after all, it has to be done perfectly.

If we reach our funding goal, we anticipate a 10 month development program to have Spend functioning ready for integration with retailers.

<p></p></div>","Welcome to our campaign to raise the capital required to further develop, test, secure, market and launch Spend.What is Spend?Spend is an App to replace loyalty cards and paper receipts. Participating retailers send your receipt, rewards and offers direct to the Spend app organising them in one place, with just one password, making your life simpler! Spend uses location data (if you opt in) to enable retailers to send relevant offers direct to your mobile or tablet while you are in store or on the move. Timed offers are also possible for example a discount on lunch if you are in the shop around lunch time!You no longer need a million reward cards packed in your handbag, purse or wallet or masses of receipts that are easy to lose plus you'll get discounts, tailored to you from the retailers where you shop, eat, drink or play.Spend helps you manage your outgoings giving you a breakdown of what you spend and where you spend it helping you to adjust your spending if needs be. Spend:No more paper receipts, but plenty of offers & rewards in one secure app!To get Spend up and running we have plenty to do, as Spend will be a massive benefit to consumers worldwide we are turning to you to help get the ball rolling. The Spend app and service will be free to consumers so please do your bit by making a contribution!Contributions of £15 or more can choose from our two free gifts or entry into our iPad Mini prize draw!** IMPORTANT Prize Draw Update - Please see the rules at the bottom of the page as they details in the 'Perks' are slightly incorrect!Find out more below, or contribute and share above.Thanks, the Spend Team!Spend in 15 seconds...Spend bridges the gap between retailers and consumers, providing consumers with a single interface to view loyalty rewards, receipts and more by taking transaction data from retailers and loyalty scheme providers, centralising securing and organising this data for access through the Spend mobile app and the powerful Spend web interface. The goals of spend are to help both consumers and retailers benefit from the data that is created by every transaction. In turn this will provide the customer with better more focussed rewards, a centralised e-receipt service along with powerful expense analysis and reporting functions, retailers will benefit from more accurate insights into the behaviour of more of their customers.Retailers benefit from improved intelligence, integration with existing rewards schemes or, where no rewards scheme is in place, Spend delivers a tailored solution enabling retailers of all sizes to offer a rewards scheme. Spend will have a strong focus on security and privacy - customer data will be protected using the very best technology while users will be able to control the offers and marketing material that they receive. Spend will automatically enable retailers to comply with forthcoming Data Protection regulations which will require explicit consent to send marketing material to customers.Going further than just rewards and receipts, users can analyse their spending habits simplifying household budgeting, expense claims and tax returns. Spend will begin life in the UK followed by rapid international deployment. With our one login, one password, one location ethos Spend will change retail interaction worldwide!For the serious shopper, we have Spend Plus, a subscription service which will deliver specially negotiated discounts and offers from leading retailers, restaurants, cinemas, theatres and more. By supporting the Spend Indiegogo Campaign not only will you ensure that we secure the funds required to further develop, test, integrate, secure and market Spend, but you will also send a powerful message to retailers that consumers want a single, simple solution to rewards and receipts.Contributions start from just £1 and there are a number of Perks available to contributors. Don't forget to share Spend with your friends and colleagues and there is much more information below. We'll also be adding video updates from the founder answering FAQ's as they come through...Free Gifts!!When you pledge £15 or more you are able to select entry to the iPad Mini competition or one of the following cool free gifts:
Spend iPad Visualisation...
Visual impression of Spend environment. Not designed to suggest endorsement by featured brands.Spend Instant Rewards makes for happy customers and happy retailers.Spend Web Interface Visualisation...Visual impression of Spend environment. Not designed to suggest endorsement by featured brands.Powerful Reporting, Budgeting & Expense Management.Facts & Figures...Recent research* demonstrates that 65% of British shoppers like the idea of receiving targeted offers direct to their smartphone, shoppers and retailers are also keen to move to paperless receipt solutions.While some retailers are attempting to make these things happen, there are problems with the solutions tried so far. The Achilles heel of current offerings is that they are disjointed and independent of one another. Consumer take up will be significantly enhanced due to Spend's universal solution.With a single login to the Spend app and web interface consumers are provided with a single view of all offers, rewards, vouchers and receipts, along with the delivery of real time offers direct to the smartphone or tablet. Spend further provides advanced features such as expense management and user led control over the marketing that they receive.The same research* reveals that trust is an issue. Grocery stores are the most trusted 68%, then loyalty card providers 58%, brands are only trusted by 32% and 24% wouldn't trust any of the above. Spend will give the consumer control over their account allowing us to increase the level of trust benefiting both the consumer and retailer alike.Contributing to spend is much more than just handing over cash - by contributing to the Spend Campaign you will of course help us raise the required £150,000 but you also send a powerful message to the retailer that you, the consumers, are ready to spend with Spend by your side. Spend will be free to end users and contributors can choose Perks giving them access to Spend Plus at reduced rates.So please get contributing or read on for much more detail on Spend and how we aim to change the world of loyalty offers and receipts. Don't forget to share the campaign with friends and colleagues to take advantage of our referral cash back offer - if your referrals raise £500+ we'll refund your contribution up to a maximum of £50!The Spend Approach...So how does Spend approach this for the benefit of both the customer and the retailer? Quite simply, it puts everything in one place giving the following top level benefits:Spend for the Customer

Simple - all receipts and rewards in one easy to use Spend account. 

Keep - track of spending, receipts, expenses and rewards.

Instant - rewards, receive time and location specific offers and rewards tailored to your buying habits. 
Spend for the Retailer

Open - a dialogue with the customer via their Spend account

See - a single view of customers, understand their habits and expectations.

Drive - repeat business through powerful insights and tailored offers.
Spend for the Environment

Save -  Trees, Spend helps reduce the amount paper used for receipts.

Clean - the streets. No more litter, everything is safe and secure online.

Hasn't this been done before?
No - not taking the approach Spend takes. Some retailers have removed paper receipts from the point of sale, for example Apple. However, overall the take up has been poor for the following reasons.
Existing solutions deliver receipts to customers via the retailers existing web and or mobile platforms. This results in customers having to visit multiple sites/apps to view receipts rather than a unified interface.
As an alternative to the above, some retailers have elected to email receipts to their customers. Email was designed for communication, not as a digital filing system which makes it harder to manage receipts adding little value to the retailer or the customer.
Lack of inertia, the above adds little value to the customer, reducing demand.
Our approach is different, Spend delivers everything for the retailer and customer in one central, easy to use, hosted solution.Who's behind Spend?Spend was founded by Freddie Alston who's background is firmly routed in data management services. Freddie has an excellent understanding of the power of information, the challenges that businesses face in managing this information and integrating solutions to manage processes and information. Freddie's general hatred for receipts led him to think about why e-receipts have not yet managed to go mainstream. The answer is clear - going it alone only really solves the retailers issues, yet it adds a burden to the customer who has to manage multiple means of receiving electronic receipts.The Spend team is made up by a group of highly motivated people with varied backgrounds, including Development, Security, IT Project Management, Infrastructure, Marketing, Design, Finance and Data Protection.Please contact us by email at 
freddie@my-spend.com.Why Indiegogo?
We've turned to Indiegogo because, quite frankly, we can't fund this entirely on our own. Spend is new. Spend is special. It's been pulled together by a team who would like to keep control of Spend rather than giving the majority away to people that we don't know and will be more interested in their own needs, rather than the needs of Spend. We are massively excited by Spend and what it has to offer and this is unlikely to be matched by external stakeholders.
Crowd-funding will allow us to develop Spend ourselves, rather than outsourcing development. This active oversight on our behalf will allow us to make sure that Spend lives up to our vision and our high standards.What We Need & What You Get...To make an impact and gather momentum, Spend really needs to capture the imagination of both consumers and retailers alike. Spend needs to be built before it can catch on, so please dig deep and make a contribution that will change the way we shop. You can give as much or a little (from £1) as you like and if you want something other than Spend in return, chose a perk.  After securing the funding, we've a lot to do. From building the team, developing systems and software, integration with existing point of sale solutions, getting retailers on board plus the less exciting legal matters and so forth. The £150K goal of this project will get things started nicely, enabling us to build a platform that is fundamentally operational and ready to implement in retailers. The major costs come from development, testing, integration and security, after all, it has to be done perfectly. It will also enable us to get marketing under way within the retail industry and to sign up early adopters to be part of the development process. If we stretch the goal, the extra funding will enable us to bring in additional experts in to accelerate the development and deployment of Spend. Importantly, the better the campaign does, the stronger message the contributors send to the retailers, underpinning the desire for such a solution and demonstrating that customers are ready for the benefits that Spend brings, remember, you contribution can be as much as you want to give starting from just £1!Take a look at the rewards available to backers of Spend, from a simple acknowledgement, being involved with the development (retailers and customers) to discounts on the Spend Plus account subscriptions!The project timeline is hard to predict as the level of funding will have a big impact on speed of development. If we reach our funding goal, we anticipate a 10 month development program to have Spend functioning ready for integration with retailers. If we exceed our funding goal, within 6 months we aim to have a feature packed Spend platform built ready for roll out.The more we raise, the faster we build and deliver Spend.Already Running a Loyalty Scheme?Excellent - you already recognise the insights that the customer data provides along with the loyalty gained from targeted offers. Now it's time to put this in the hands of your customers - Spend is modular enabling the retailer to integrate existing receipt and rewards data direct to their customers Spend account. Working with Spend will also help you mop up the customers who don't participate in your existing scheme!
Down to the nitty gritty

<p></p><p></p><h2>What you get</h2>
<p>An Android app and cross-platform library (for building additional
applications) which utilizes the comprehensive nutrition data
provided by <a href=""http://www.nutritionix.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">NutritionIX</a>(1) and possibly
other sources. With the Android app you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search ""over 500 national restaurant chains""(2) and view nutrition
information for their menu items.</li>
<li>Look up nutrition information for a variety of food items (e.g. from
the USDA).</li>
<li>View the following nutrition information for the looked-up item:
<ul>
<li>Calories</li>
<li>Fats</li>
<li>Carbohydrates</li>
<li>Sodium</li>
<li>Cholesterol</li>
<li>Protein</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><p>(If you need an iPhone, iPad or Windows Phone app please see the
<strong>Looking ahead</strong> section below.)</p>
<p>
</p><strong>But not just you</strong> - the whole world gets to benefit from this project:

<ul>
<li>Everything will be made available under open source and/or creative
commons licenses.</li>
<li>If fully funded, the Android app will be a free download in the
Google Play Store (provided it is approved by Google).</li>
</ul><p>(1) <strong>Please note that I do not work for or represent NutritionIX and
have no official connection to them</strong>. NutritionIX provides a very
useful website, but it does not work well on mobile browsers and they do
not provide a mobile app. Nor have I have been able to find an Android
app that displays general nutrition information using their data. (The
one app I've found, <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=appinventor.ai_brazentone.ChowChecker"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Chow
Checker</a>,
uses the NutritionIX database to identify potential allergy risks.)</p>
<p>(2) From the NutritionIX website.</p>
<h2>What your contribution provides</h2>
<p>In a nutshell, you get my focus on this project for approximately
one month.</p>
<p>I estimate that it will take me about a month to create the Android app
and the underlying library that will interface with the NutritionIX
API. As I was recently downsized, I now have the time to work on
this - as long as I don't have to worry about feeding my family, paying
bills, etc. Knowing that I'm covered for the equivalent of one month's
salary (including taxes, healthcare, etc.) will allow me to focus on
this work instead of polishing my resume, attending interviews and
hunting for clients.</p><p>Even if you can't donate there are other ways you can help. <i><b>Spreading the word is the most critical thing you can do for this project</b></i> - tell your friends, co-workers, even your doctor.

<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I have been designing and developing software for over 20 years - from
pharmacy systems to children's games to resources for students. My
passion is creating tools that improve and enrich our lives. While I've
not yet had the opportunity to ship a mobile app I have spent the last
10 years working with C# (the primary language for the cross-platform
Xamarin framework) and web technologies. Most recently, I was the
architect and primary developer of an open source common library for
community and technical colleges in the State of Washington and created
a web API for the online class schedule built on top of that library.</p>

The images above are only provided as preliminary sketches and are
  NOT necessarily representative of the final product.

What you get
An Android app and cross-platform library (for building additional
applications) which utilizes the comprehensive nutrition data
provided by NutritionIX(1) and possibly
other sources. With the Android app you will be able to:

Search ""over 500 national restaurant chains""(2) and view nutrition
information for their menu items.
Look up nutrition information for a variety of food items (e.g. from
the USDA).
View the following nutrition information for the looked-up item:

Calories
Fats
Carbohydrates
Sodium
Cholesterol
Protein


(If you need an iPhone, iPad or Windows Phone app please see the
Looking ahead section below.)

But not just you - the whole world gets to benefit from this project:


Everything will be made available under open source and/or creative
commons licenses.
If fully funded, the Android app will be a free download in the
Google Play Store (provided it is approved by Google).
(1) Please note that I do not work for or represent NutritionIX and
have no official connection to them. NutritionIX provides a very
useful website, but it does not work well on mobile browsers and they do
not provide a mobile app. Nor have I have been able to find an Android
app that displays general nutrition information using their data. (The
one app I've found, Chow
Checker,
uses the NutritionIX database to identify potential allergy risks.)
(2) From the NutritionIX website.
What your contribution provides
In a nutshell, you get my focus on this project for approximately
one month.
I estimate that it will take me about a month to create the Android app
and the underlying library that will interface with the NutritionIX
API. As I was recently downsized, I now have the time to work on
this - as long as I don't have to worry about feeding my family, paying
bills, etc. Knowing that I'm covered for the equivalent of one month's
salary (including taxes, healthcare, etc.) will allow me to focus on
this work instead of polishing my resume, attending interviews and
hunting for clients.Even if you can't donate there are other ways you can help. Spreading the word is the most critical thing you can do for this project - tell your friends, co-workers, even your doctor. Use the buttons on this site to share this campaign on Facebook, Twitter, etc. For ways to generally support my work, please see my Support Shawn's work page.
About me
I have been designing and developing software for over 20 years - from
pharmacy systems to children's games to resources for students. My
passion is creating tools that improve and enrich our lives. While I've
not yet had the opportunity to ship a mobile app I have spent the last
10 years working with C# (the primary language for the cross-platform
Xamarin framework) and web technologies. Most recently, I was the
architect and primary developer of an open source common library for
community and technical colleges in the State of Washington and created
a web API for the online class schedule built on top of that library.

Availability

The foundation library will be made available under an open source

availability of nutritional tools. If somebody else wants to use it
to build another app that's fine with me.
The source code for the Android app will also be made available

I will also be posting regular updates in the style of SCRUM
Stand-ups.

that works with virtually all smart phones and tablets.

Wrote about the Bpen -
The Bpen Compatible with: IPhone 4s, IPhone 5c, Samsung, Sony etc... The idea of a pen that is also a phone stand was created while I was on a business trip. I was at a restaurant & as I was being served my meal, when I received a Skype call from my son. I was in a rush to get to an urgent meeting and realized I wouldn't be able to finish the meal. When the call ended, I understood that I really need to have a phone stand so my hands can be free to function. 
1. A Quality Pen and a Touch Pen made of  aircraft-grade aluminum - It functions both as a regular pen and a touch pen for tablets and/or smartphones. Just switch the Bpen clock wise and your touch pen will turn to a writing pen in a blink of an eye.2. An Amazing Stand (with or without the Bpen base)- It is a stand for all phone types with or without covers, vertically 
or horizontally, to watch movies, chat on Skype and just to be able to 
be hands-free in general.Horizontal & Landscape easy view:4. Car Mount Stand - It is useful when driving, for navigation as it is safe because it doesn't interfere with our field of vision.5. Keep it Anywhere - The pen is inexpensive, yet highly functional, so we can keep a number of pens in vital places for different purposes. 
For example, at the office, at home, in a bag, in a car, as well as in shirt pockets, pants or even in a book.
6. Just when you need it - The pen is light for carrying, comes in lively colors and is available for work at a drop of a hat. The Bpen can be used without the base, but for extra stability (for 
example when driving or when it is used as a tablet holder) we also 
created the aluminum base.Often we find ourselves searching for a pen, forgetting where we placed it. 
Now, we will always find it in its base on the desk at home, in the office or in the car.
It's used as a dock while driving in the car and permits the phone to remain stable whilst driving.For use with tablets, for stability and 45 degree angles, which 
allows you to watch movies, play games, answer emails, chat on Skype and

 to the base, the other side is anti-slip so the base will not move. 
Super strong stickiness, waterproof, cleans up easily, washable and 
reusable. It does not leave marks and easy to transfer from place to place. Ink Inserts: Included with every Bpen is an extra FREE  Ink insert.1. This is solely a touch pen that functions as a key holder and can

We also have to scale our servers to ensure that the app works properly for everyone, free and premium, which adds more overhead the larger we become. Scaling isn’t the only cost that Premium subscribers cover either; this revenue keeps the lights on at Ulzi and lets our team continue to innovate new and better ways to provide worldwide safety and freedom.

Ulzi’s Yellow Alert allows you to customize exactly who responds when you need help—whether that’s your best friend, roommate, a group of nearby community members, or a combination.

Ulzi Sense, our revolutionary artificial intelligence, can tell when you might be in a dangerous situation through machine learning that only gets better over time. It sends for help without you having to even press a button. By monitoring your phone’s sensors, like the accelerometer, Ulzi Sense can learn what triggers and movements indicate you’re in an emergency situation. By the way, if it detects violence but all you did is drop your phone, for example, you’ll have a window to type in a passcode and let us know that you’re okay. We can send help if you don’t type that passcode in, or if the wrong passcode is entered.</p></div></details><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524759166/a8jo36g0tl3cgmafc25o.png"" src=""""/></p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">OUR STORY</h2><p>You might be wondering how we came up with many of these innovations.

By creating a solution that piggybacks off of the popularity of smartphone technology, we ensure that users with limited financial resources will be able to access Ulzi on a device they will already need – rather than create an additional device they would need to purchase to use our software.

A key problem responders face is not knowing where the 911 caller is located. Often, callers can’t give their exact location, leaving law enforcement in a tight spot when they try to find them. In fact, law enforcement only know a caller’s location within 300 meters (that’s around 3 football fields) if the caller can’t give an exact address – and that’s in the most cell tower dense areas of the country. Their ability to locate a caller in rural areas or smaller towns is even more limited. Most other safety solutions, like emergency button apps and wearables, also fall short on response time. They often use third party call centers to send your exact location to law enforcement, but it takes time and third party centers can still make mistakes. Ulzi’s solution addresses this issue by integrating with law enforcement dispatch centers so they can receive users’ exact GPS location immediately. In the meantime, trusted community responders can get to you even faster.</p></div></details><details style=""margin:1em 0;""><summary style=""display: list-item;padding:1em 1em 1em 1.25em;line-height: 1.2em;cursor: pointer;border:1px solid;border-radius:5px;background:#f8f8fa;color: #000;""> <span style=""display: block;margin:-2.2em -1em -1em 2em;padding:1em;padding-left:0;font-weight: 700;"">How do we know Ulzi, and all the info I'm about to give about myself in order to use it, is secure?<span style=""font-weight: 100;color: #85C133;""> </span> </span> </summary><div style=""padding:1.25em 2em 2em;background:#fff;padding-bottom:1.25em;""><p style=""margin:0;font-size: 1.15em;line-height: 1.65em;"">For Ulzi, user security and privacy has been a keystone of our company from the very beginning.  Our security measures – both in the app and on our servers – not only meet, but exceed industry standards.

A user who is worried about walking home alone at night has different needs from a user who is in an abusive relationship. For instance, if a user were being attacked on their walk home, they would want to activate all of Ulzi’s safety features at once. But in a situation involving domestic violence, a user may only want to send a message to a close friend to intervene and record audio and video for evidence at the same time. Ulzi provides options for both of these situations. Ulzi allows you to customize your alerts and safety settings to give users a spectrum of safety features, rather than an option that forces you to use tools they don’t need or want. Users can also customize their information sharing, so that they can control who tracks them, responds to their alerts, and can see their personal details.</p></div></details><details style=""margin:1em 0;""><summary style=""display: list-item;padding:1em 1em 1em 1.25em;line-height: 1.2em;cursor: pointer;border:1px solid;border-radius:5px;background:#f8f8fa;color: #000;""> <span style=""display: block;margin:-2.2em -1em -1em 2em;padding:1em;padding-left:0;font-weight: 700;"">Why did you create a Yellow Alert, when you already have Red Alert?<span style=""font-weight: 100;color: #85C133;""> </span> </span> </summary><div style=""padding:1.25em 2em 2em;background:#fff;padding-bottom:1.25em;""><p style=""margin:0;font-size: 1.15em;line-height: 1.65em;"">Partially driven by how Ulzi started, we found that it’s not as common for someone to jump out of the bushes at you.

So Ulzi has developed our most socially innovative feature yet - our Yellow Alert. A feature so your best friend or roommate can know to come casually extract you, before the situation has the chance to get worse. Yellow Alert is for those times when you don't know if anyone's actually done something illegal, but don't want to wait for the worst to get help. Yellow Alert is a middle step that gives you a chance to get that help, to stop that crime before it happens. Ulzi gives you a new alternative to calling the police prematurely or waiting for the worst.

So, that user would choose to send their location to law enforcement, their emergency contacts, and nearby community responders.

So are we.Safety has always been something you do by yourself. We’re here to change that.It’s been on you- to have pepper spray, to glance over your shoulder while walking in a parking garage. To call someone on your way home at night. Not that the person on the other end of the line would be able to do much if something did happen.Aside from parents staying up late waiting for that “made it home!” text, safety has been a personal burden.Just look at the numbers-- We’ve become accustomed to making decisions based off of fear and worry. We’ve let fear dictate our lives. We’ve gotten used to a lack of peace of mind.And as great as items like pepper spray and Bluetooth wearables are for an added layer of safety - they’re not a solution. They’re not comprehensive; they rely on you to act during an emergency, to not forget it at home. They give an illusion of peace of mind.Until there is a solution that addresses every aspect of your safety, we are not able to live fully, without worry.Until there is a solution that prevents violent crime, we - as people - are not free.So right here, right now on Indiegogo, we’re calling on community. Community that’s there for one another in times of distress, to give you your full peace of mind and freedom back.We cannot afford to let the statistics of violence continue. And if we work together, we don't have to. So that’s where Ulzi comes in.Join the movement to make the world safer. Your 1 Premium subscription allows Ulzi to host 50 people on a free version of the app.HOW IT WORKSThe premium version of the app includes features which provide unparalleled safety for you and your loved ones.Check out Ulzi’s main features at a glance, whether you want to protect yourself or a loved one. Everything is customizable, anytime.WHAT YOU GET, WHAT YOU GIVEHere's the thing, safety shouldn't be something that you pay for. We know this. And while we can't provide everything in the Premium version of the app for free (especially as we scale up, scroll down to see a cost breakdown) - we do want to provide free, comprehensive safety to those that wouldn't otherwise have access. In fact, the free version of Ulzi is still the best, most comprehensive solution there is.So we decided to revamp the Freemium model, our way. Our Premium subscribers are helping us put the free version of the app in the hands of those that need it. We can make sure that millions of people have Ulzi’s comprehensive safety features, but we can’t do it without you.In return for each Premium subscription, we will be able to host 50 users on a free version of Ulzi.Just imagine the possibilities: 1 family plan could help us reach 50 families in need; one club or campus organization could protect an entire university.We are building a technological solution to a social issue. But we need you! Hang on, why don’t you provide some of these features on the free version? Or just make the Premium version expensive enough to cover every feature in the free?   We want the free version to exist for everyone that otherwise couldn’t get the app. Your Premium subscription allows us to do that (at a pretty awesome ratio, too). But, that doesn’t mean we want the Premium to be unaffordable either! We want families to be able to have it for all their kids, for school organizations to be able to provide it to students, etc. The features that we can’t put in the free version are simply too expensive to provide to the number of people we want to reach with the free app at this time. We also have to scale our servers to ensure that the app works properly for everyone, free and premium, which adds more overhead the larger we become. Scaling isn’t the only cost that Premium subscribers cover either; this revenue keeps the lights on at Ulzi and lets our team continue to innovate new and better ways to provide worldwide safety and freedom. That’s why we’re starting here, on Indiegogo, with supporters like you that we know also want to see the world become a better place. Because your 1 premium subscription allows us to host FIFTY others on the free version, this is the best way to get the most comprehensive safety system into the hands of the most people!WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT?Ulzi works for you, so you can work for others. Ulzi give you the chance to be part of “crowdsourced safety.” Meaning, you’ll be there for people in their times of need. When everyone looks out for one another, no one is ever truly alone.Through emergency notifications, GPS tracking, safe route planning, and artificial intelligence, your phone and your community can always have your back, and you’ll have peace of mind when it comes to your loved ones’ safety.There have been plenty of partial solutions up until now, but check out this chart to see how Ulzi is taking it a step further. How is the Red Alert better than just calling the police, or other emergency buttons and apps?   Most other solutions can’t guarantee the police get your exact GPS location. In fact, they either use third party call centers or can only guarantee that police get within 3 football fields of you. But Ulzi uses a new interface in cooperation with every law enforcement dispatch center, getting them your exact GPS location right off the bat. In the meantime, trusted community responders can get to you even faster. What’s the point of a Yellow Alert?   There are lots of solutions that provide Red Alerts, like bluetooth devices and wearables that call 9-1-1 if you activate it. But, aside from the fact that you don’t always have these on your person, they also provide no middle step—for all the situations where you want help, but you don’t want police involved. Ulzi’s Yellow Alert allows you to customize exactly who responds when you need help—whether that’s your best friend, roommate, a group of nearby community members, or a combination. All the while, your emergency contacts can stay up to date with where you are and what’s going on. Ulzi can do it all—and you can customize it all. What’s Ulzi Sense?   Other solutions, like standard emergency buttons and wearables, require you to have time to activate them yourself. Other solutions before Ulzi rely on you knowing that you’re in danger and having time to react. But sometimes, you can’t do it yourself. Ulzi can activate safety features even when you can’t. Ulzi Sense, our revolutionary artificial intelligence, can tell when you might be in a dangerous situation through machine learning that only gets better over time. It sends for help without you having to even press a button. By monitoring your phone’s sensors, like the accelerometer, Ulzi Sense can learn what triggers and movements indicate you’re in an emergency situation. By the way, if it detects violence but all you did is drop your phone, for example, you’ll have a window to type in a passcode and let us know that you’re okay. We can send help if you don’t type that passcode in, or if the wrong passcode is entered.OUR STORYYou might be wondering how we came up with many of these innovations. Well, aside from the features being informed by real stories and experiences from survivors of assault, we have the help of experts in fields like security, law enforcement, and legislation working with us.Ulzi began as a platform where people shared unfiltered stories of sexual assault and intimate partner violence, to prompt conversation and break stigma of an issue often swept under the rug on college campuses. The platform and stories went viral worldwide in 2016, and we haven’t stopped since. We’ve listened to thousands of stories, and calls for action, and that’s when we began to create Ulzi: the tangible solution - the tangible tool for prevention - while the awareness movement continues to grow.Survivors, security industry specialists, expert developers, policy writers, and passionate people from around the globe have joined the team to create Ulzi - to make safety, community, and freedom more accessible for everyone, everywhere.

Back us to get exclusive updates and details throughout the campaign!OUR VISIONWhen we don’t have to worry about our own safety, or the safety of our loved ones, we’re free to live happier, more abundant lives. We want to make this dream a reality for the world, but we need your help to make it happen.Going worldwide one community at a time, and keeping it free for those who otherwise wouldn’t have access, is a concept that relies on you as an aware community member. If you can help us here on Indiegogo, you’ll be helping us reach our goal of getting Ulzi in the hands of everyone, everywhere. Literally!When you back our campaign, you’re not just getting an app. You’re joining the safety revolution.PerksRISKS & CHALLENGESThe risk and challenges are already here: a lack of safety and peace of mind globally. Help us change this for good, starting right now.Every contribution goes to maintaining our servers, scaling for more users, and making the app better, more accessible, and more effective worldwide.FAQ How reliable is Ulzi's Loved One Tracking?   Ulzi’s GPS features are built on a multi-million dollar enterprise-grade asset tracking platform. It is time-tested, robust, and currently trusted to track hundreds of thousands of assets globally. Our system provides precise coordinates–typically accurate within 3 meters–and geo-coding (street address). This gives twofold location reporting for responders and law enforcement. Why is Ulzi so accessible, and why hasn't someone already done what you do?   The Ulzi team likes to say 'People first, company second.' That means with everything we do, we strive to make it as accessible as possible no matter where or how you live. That’s why we decided to make a free version of Ulzi. As technology advances, cell phones – specifically smartphones – are becoming more ubiquitous and affordable. By creating a solution that piggybacks off of the popularity of smartphone technology, we ensure that users with limited financial resources will be able to access Ulzi on a device they will already need – rather than create an additional device they would need to purchase to use our software. Additionally, Ulzi has come up with a method for working with law enforcement without adding to the cost of our subscriptions. Why not just call 9-1-1?   The national average response time for law enforcement is over 18 minutes. A key problem responders face is not knowing where the 911 caller is located. Often, callers can’t give their exact location, leaving law enforcement in a tight spot when they try to find them. In fact, law enforcement only know a caller’s location within 300 meters (that’s around 3 football fields) if the caller can’t give an exact address – and that’s in the most cell tower dense areas of the country. Their ability to locate a caller in rural areas or smaller towns is even more limited. Most other safety solutions, like emergency button apps and wearables, also fall short on response time. They often use third party call centers to send your exact location to law enforcement, but it takes time and third party centers can still make mistakes. Ulzi’s solution addresses this issue by integrating with law enforcement dispatch centers so they can receive users’ exact GPS location immediately. In the meantime, trusted community responders can get to you even faster. How do we know Ulzi, and all the info I'm about to give about myself in order to use it, is secure?   For Ulzi, user security and privacy has been a keystone of our company from the very beginning.  Our security measures – both in the app and on our servers – not only meet, but exceed industry standards. We are constantly evolving our security measures as new technologies emerge and change the way we look at security. With multiple communication redundancies built into it, Ulzi can automatically and dynamically send signals in intervals over whichever mediums are available in the case of a primary connectivity failure. These channels include cellular, WiFi, API, and SMS. Where did the name Ulzi come from?   Ulzi may be a bit of a weird word to hear at first, but it has incredible meaning behind it. Ulzi is the endless knot – stemming from Mongolian roots. It is the symbol of the interconnectedness of all beings on our planet. It represents community. It represents togetherness. It represents how – as people – we are interdependent on one another. We think that this knot is the perfect symbol for what we are trying to accomplish. Why an app? Why now?   The fact is, the number of people in the world with smartphones is growing quickly. And everyone belongs to some kind of social network. Today, people still protect themselves with mace or a whistle; these are all things you do by yourself. But more and more, we carry these computers in our pockets, and are all connected to each other . We have gps, we have maps, we have notifications. It’s time for a new kind of safety - personal safety that leverages the interconnectedness of today's world. What if I don't want all the emergency features? Or only some of them?   Not all emergency situations are the same, so we made Ulzi completely customizable. A user who is worried about walking home alone at night has different needs from a user who is in an abusive relationship. For instance, if a user were being attacked on their walk home, they would want to activate all of Ulzi’s safety features at once. But in a situation involving domestic violence, a user may only want to send a message to a close friend to intervene and record audio and video for evidence at the same time. Ulzi provides options for both of these situations. Ulzi allows you to customize your alerts and safety settings to give users a spectrum of safety features, rather than an option that forces you to use tools they don’t need or want. Users can also customize their information sharing, so that they can control who tracks them, responds to their alerts, and can see their personal details. Why did you create a Yellow Alert, when you already have Red Alert?   Partially driven by how Ulzi started, we found that it’s not as common for someone to jump out of the bushes at you. More often, people find themselves in a situation that slowly escalated until emergency response is needed. But most solutions are either 100 or 0. You either call the police or do nothing. So Ulzi has developed our most socially innovative feature yet - our Yellow Alert. A feature so your best friend or roommate can know to come casually extract you, before the situation has the chance to get worse. Yellow Alert is for those times when you don't know if anyone's actually done something illegal, but don't want to wait for the worst to get help. Yellow Alert is a middle step that gives you a chance to get that help, to stop that crime before it happens. Ulzi gives you a new alternative to calling the police prematurely or waiting for the worst. With Ulzi, stories end with prevention, not investigation. Will Ulzi kill my battery?   Any app that has a mapping feature drains phone batteries. They’re notorious for it. But what good is a safety app if the phone it’s on is dead? That’s why we’ve spent a huge number of man hours making our app as battery efficient as possible. On top of that, Ulzi Sense, our AI, will gather data and become more and more adept at determining when you’re in trouble. This isn’t just good for you, it’s great for your phone’s battery. The longer it’s on your phone, the better it will get at optimizing your battery life. Is my privacy safe?   Users have full control over who can see them. Not only can users choose who tracks them, or pause location sharing altogether, Red Alert and Yellow Alert can be customized to only send a user’s location to people they want to help. For instance, Red Alert will likely be used when a user is in an emergency, and needs help as quickly as possible. So, that user would choose to send their location to law enforcement, their emergency contacts, and nearby community responders. But if a user is at a bar or a party and just wants to let a select group of people—like a roommate or friend—to help them, they could customize their Yellow Alert to only send their location to specific contacts. Why smartphones?   The best safety solution is going to be one that is always with you. Ulzi leverages a technology that you already have in your pocket: your phone. In today’s world, everything is becoming accessible from our phones: concert tickets, boarding passes, email, social media, GPS, door locks, etc. So in order to be effective, Ulzi understands that the best way to keep yourself and your loved ones safe - is through a solution that is always by your side and a solution that you are the least likely to forget at home - unlike most bluetooth technologies. (But if you have one that you love, you can still pair it with Ulzi to gain our functionality!) Why do you automatically start recording audio and video during an emergency?   From the many stories Ulzi has received, it has become very apparent that collecting evidence in certain situations is an absolute must . Ulzi allows you to start recording audio and video once you set off an alert. This data can be accessed by the user and provides more accurate information to universities, in courtrooms, or whichever way it is needed by the ARI (At-Risk-Individual). Not only can you customize the audio/video feature to both the Yellow and Red alerts, but responders also have the ability to record audio/video once they decide to respond to an emergency.

  USB+USB C+Apple Lightning+flash memory drive.

We are proud to present you unique multifunctional wristband, inspired by design and innovation of Mac Book Air

Apple keeps on surprising us over and over reinventing each essential element as part of a singular, deceptively simple design. It is everything there is to love about Mac. In its purest form ever.



The new USB‑C port puts just about everything you need in a port all in one place. This amazing port provides charging, speedy USB 3 data transfer, and video output in a small, reversible design that is one-third the size of the current USB port.



Uni-i wristband could be used as a cable to charge all of your Apple devices as well as transfering and saving data, furthermore it could be used as an adapter between USB and USB C





The sleek design is absoulutely compatible with all Apple products and will be a nice addition to your Apple devices.

Help us provide high-quality educational resources to the five billion people who lack Internet access.


Our customized pocket libraries:



deliver the right information 



to the right hands 



at the right time.      


The eGranary Pocket Library is a collection of customized educational web-based resources developed by experienced digital librarians and computer programmers at The WiderNet Project. The collections are curated onto portable chips and intended for use with devices in areas where Internet access is impossible or impractical.
 
""In places like Sierre Leone, 1.7% of the population has Internet, so this is the best way for most people to get access to information."" -- Mashable""Everything looks and acts like the internet, but all offline."" -- Christian Science Monitor""The eGranary Pocket Library hopes to help close the digital divide - those communities with access to digital technology, and those without."" -- Versus
Beyond the Reaches of The Internet

In much of the developing world, there is no access to educational opportunities: no Internet, sparsely stocked libraries, out of date books and journals, and no connection to the world of information most of us access with the click of a mouse.
Billions of people are starving for information; literally dying for a lack of knowledge. If someone cannot access information on how to properly dig a well, for example, they run the risk of spreading disease.
Our pocket libraries provide critical information to those most in need of these educational resources.
 
Information for All, Customized to Individual Needs

The WiderNet Project is dedicated to providing educational resources for everyone. However, for inexperienced populations, using the Internet for the first time can be overwhelming - a bit like drinking from a fire hose.We've learned that offering smaller, customized, verified, and organized sets of information allows people to more efficiently find what they are seeking.
With the eGranary Pocket Library, we make it easier for librarians, educators, and volunteers around the world to organize information into small portable chip-size collections that can be simply copied to the patron’s flash memory or internal drive in a laptop, tablet, or smart phone.
DONATE NOW!
Your donation will provide a student or village health worker a wealth of information at their fingertips!
A student discusses the benefits of having an eGranary at the Dandiboru School in Ethiopia
We 
				need your help to build the ""Next Generation"" eGranary: Pocket Libraries.We will use your contribution to support the development 
of multiple collections with partners worldwide, developing new crowd source technology and interfaces 
so experts from the local communities can work with colleagues around the world 
to build the most appropriate collections for the communities they serve.
This three-year project will have students and volunteers at 
				the WiderNet Project working with colleagues in underserved areas in the U.S. and the developing world to develop dozens of chip-sized collections that focus on topics like language and literacy, life skills, vocational education, IT skills, health sciences, math, science, and more.
Experienced librarians and programmers will be recruited for each collection, along with volunteers and representatives of the target populations. We are not simply creating a software that distributes random information, aka ""shovelware,"" but instead 
				thoughtfully curated, catalogued and searchable libraries containing practical and essential resources.

Though internet coverage has increased exponentially in developed countries, it has lagged far behind in the developing world with wide disparities in global connectivity.
In 2011, the United Nations reported that while more than half of the wealthy world is online, a mere 15 percent of people in developing countries are connected. The WiderNet Project is “building a bridge across the digital divide” in order to attack information poverty and encourage education, research and collaboration.

Digital Library
We have been distributing our off-line libraries to underserved populations for 14 years. We call our library the “eGranary” because it stores the seeds of knowledge much like a granary stores seeds. With almost 1,000 installations, we have reached millions of users to date.
The eGranary houses 32 million documents including the entire Wikipedia website, materials from the Khan Academy, and much, much more. Our eGranary is invaluable to hospitals, schools, and libraries in developing nations from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe and in rural areas and prisons here in America. And WiderNet has plans to expand locally by installing eGranaries in low income housing communities.
In 2000, poor Internet access in Africa inspired Cliff Missen, a Professor of Library Science at UNC Chapel Hill, to begin the WiderNet project, with the goal of bringing computing capability and substantial information resources to the five billion people who lack sufficient Internet access.
Focusing on low-cost information technology alternatives for the world’s poor, The WiderNet Project provides both hardware and specialized training. The innovative cornerstone of the project is the eGranary Digital Library, or “Internet in a Box:” A single eGranary can serve thousands of users and have profound benefits.
 





The Prototype Pocket Library in Practice
The WiderNet Project developed and distributed the first eGranary Pocket Library during the recent Ebola crisis. Our Ebola Pocket Library contains practical information critically needed in the hardest hit areas.
We saw clearly during the height of the Ebola epidemic that lack of access to accurate and timely information was a major contributing factor to the disease's spread. As Dr. Guido Borghese, UNICEF Prinicpal Advisor of Child Survival & Development for west and Central Africa noted, ""Ebola kills people; but more lives are put at risk because of lack of information or misinformation...""
The chips can be freely copied so that the information can spread faster than the disease!

Spreading the Seeds of Knowledge

With our pocket libraries, the eGranary will no longer be confined to a central server location, but will be able to be shared via smartphones, tablets, laptops and flash drives.  
With every eGranary we include easy-to-use tools that allow local users to create 
and upload their own content.
 




Mulugeta Assefa, our Field Associate in Ethiopia, 
		reports...



""I was in Hawassa University for a workshop, in collaboration with MEPI and the College of Medicine and Health Science, to implement the eGranary and help them develop their own local content. The workshop was successful. We were able 
to organize an eGranary club, which is responsible to search for important resources both from the eG and the digitized collections of the university, 
students, and instructors and then make it available to users through the use of the CIP.""  -  Mulugeta

<p>A lot of key developments that led to the computer revolution happened in the Boston/Cambridge area, and there's still a lot going on today. Unfortunately, there is no organization specifically charged with collecting, preserving and exhibiting that history. Once upon a time there was a Boston Computer Museum, but it moved to Silicon Valley. Other computer museums have sprung up around the world since then, but not in the Boston/Cambridge area. Since the Boston Computer Museum moved, a lot of historical computers and related materials have been accumulating in offices, basements, garages, storage areas and barns. People know that what they have is historic, so they don’t get rid of it, but they don’t have a local place for it to go where they can trust that it will be saved for posterity. Among other things, Digital Den will be a place where people can turn to help them cope with the massive back-log of historical computing systems and related materials that have been accumulating for years with no place to go.</p>
<p>This Indiegogo campaign is being held to support the next phase of Digital Den’s development, but it isn’t just about getting funds. It is also about finding out if there is enough interest to sustain a non-profit organization dedicated to computer history in the Boston/Cambridge area.  It doesn’t make sense to establish an official non-profit organization and continue expending resources to do this if there isn’t wide-spread interest from a lot of other people. A true non-profit organization needs more than a tiny group of enthusiasts to succeed -- there needs to be a broad and enthusiastic audience. The response to this campaign will determine whether there is enough interest and support to sustain Digital Den into the future.</p>

<p><strong>Phase 1 Setup (July – September, 2013)</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><i>Computer Archive</i><br/>I've gotten the ball rolling by setting up an initial Computer Archive that is co-located in the iconic Metropolitan Storage next to MIT's main entrance.</p>

<p>There are already more than 20 personal computers capable of running most versions of standard PC and Apple operating systems as well as many applications and extensive content software. There are other people ready and willing to contribute their collections of hardware and software, but we will not accept them unless this Indiegogo campaign is successful.</p>

<p><em>Computer Arcade</em><br/>
Digital Den has a collection of innovative, unique and fun computer interfaces (e.g. projected keyboard, video glasses, Leap Motion and MindWave). We plan to expand the collection to include many products from  companies with offices in the Boston/Cambridge area. This collection will be the foundation of an exhibit about the evolution of ways that computer interfaces have been used to extend the human senses. The ultimate goal will be demonstrate how to push the boundaries of immersive experiences by pairing high end commercial platforms (e.g. high end photo-realistic VR software and games) with advanced displays (multi-screen, surround video and 3D), surround sound and new motion/haptic technologies to create more powerful computing experiences than are normally available to the general public (or even experts who work with the individual products/projects). This exhibit is a prototype of the Computer Arcade, and it will be the shown at a special event in the fall.</p>
<p><strong>Phase 2 Start-up (October – December, 2013)</strong></p>
<p>This Indiegogo campaign is being held to support Phase 2 of Digital Den’s development. If it is successful then Phase 2 will begin in October of 2013.</p>
<p>These are the main things we plan to accomplish...</p>

There have already been enough offers to expand the archive to more than 50 computers that would also include Sun, DEC and Wang workstations. <br/><br/><em>Establish the Computer Arcade</em><br/>Digital Den’s collection for the exhibit about the evolution of computer interfaces, which will serve as a prototype for the Computer Arcade, will definitely be shown at least one event in the fall. There will be an active search for locations interested in displaying the collection on a rotating basis. For example, there are a number of programs in local universities that would benefit from having short-term access to the collection. Finally, there will be an attempt to find a permanent location to house exhibits that will be able to be open during evening and weekend hours.</p>

<p><strong>Why Contribute? </strong></p>
<p>Your contributions will be used to find solutions to unexpected issues identified by beta testers. We have self funded this project to date. The cost to host our servers is extremely expensive. The cost for server hardware is adding up. We have built an app that is very hardware intensive. All of the heavy lifting is done on these servers. The application uses very few resources to capture the data on the phone itself. We are also looking to add additional features, such as viewing the phone's history ""behind the wheel"" in a graphical view.  In addition, we want to integrate features such as ""Cloud to Smart Device"" (C2SD) communications. This feature will send event notifications to the parent or account holder's phone via push notifications. Delivery will be faster and more efficient, eliminating the need for email or text message notifications. If we can gain enough support to get the C2SD working, it will allow us to offer this product at a lower price.</p>

<p><br/> Chad and Kip</p></div>","Smart phone application to help drivers become safer by limiting and monitoring distractions while driving.
GREAT APP FOR:

Parents who want to monitor their teenage drivers.
Businesses who want to monitor their drivers and assets.
Anyone who wants to become a safer driver and reduce phone use while driving.

Why Contribute? 
Your contributions will be used to find solutions to unexpected issues identified by beta testers. We have self funded this project to date. The cost to host our servers is extremely expensive. The cost for server hardware is adding up. We have built an app that is very hardware intensive. All of the heavy lifting is done on these servers. The application uses very few resources to capture the data on the phone itself. We are also looking to add additional features, such as viewing the phone's history ""behind the wheel"" in a graphical view.  In addition, we want to integrate features such as ""Cloud to Smart Device"" (C2SD) communications. This feature will send event notifications to the parent or account holder's phone via push notifications. Delivery will be faster and more efficient, eliminating the need for email or text message notifications. If we can gain enough support to get the C2SD working, it will allow us to offer this product at a lower price.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>MAIL1CLICK is a private company under the name of ""Kryptotel"" that specializes in building secure telecommunication services and
infrastructures. As one of the founders and evangelists I strongly believe that the world we live in needs a safer FREE mail service.</p>
<p>In today's day and age everything is done through the internet, we must  be able to protect our identity and privacy at all times. Companies are hired not only to watch what users do online but to infiltrate information and use that for their own purpose and goals. All emails stored on our behalf by Google, Yahoo, Facebook, and other similar companies are a clear and easy target for those companies and governments that want to invade our privacy. The saying ""possession is nine tenths of the Law"" couldn't be more accurate..... we need to take it on our selves to protect our rights, Privacy and Encryption needs to be in our hands to guarantee our safety!</p>
<p>MAIL1CLICK is a free mail service that can be run on any computer, tablet or smart phone. Our company servers are located in 54 data centers in 21 different
countries. Our entire infrastructure is 100% protected against any kind of
disastrous event, earthquakes, tsunami, tornado's and physical tampering. All our servers are connected to each other through encrypted VPNs
(virtual private networks), the server's disks are fully encrypted avoiding any
local physical threat resulting in an additional layer of encryption to your encrypted
email service.<br/></p>We need your help to keep moving forward. <br/><br/><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal here is to give every email user out there a REAL ALTERNATIVE, something that will PROTECT their emails from any kind of threat.  <br/></p>
<p>We are in the need to develop a MAIL1CLICK version for IOS / MAC OS/X and Windows Mobile. MAIL1CLICK is available already via Web, Windows and Android .... this is just an <i><b>additional certification</b></i> that our team has been committed to this project for a while and the living proof is in the fact that MAIL1CLICK is live and running!!!!<br/></p>
<p>Effectively 5 people will be actively working on MAIL1CLICK. The money we are trying to raise is to cover the living expenses of 4 out 5 individuals that will be working on this for the time necessary to develop the IOS / MAC OS/X and Windows Mobile version. I am the 5th person and as an evangelist I will personally not receive any funds from this project but I have committed my time, energy and personal resources to making this happen. We want to release the versions as soon as physically possible. <br/></p>
<p>When you think of 100K divided by 4 people it comes down to 25K each. When you take out taxes and expenses.... there isn't much left. We all have families and are taking this risk to support something we truly believe in, EMAIL PRIVACY.</p>
<p>With the money we get this is what you will get: <br/></p>
<p>- MAIL1CLICK for IOS / MAC OS/X and WINDOWS MOBILE.<br/></p>
<p>- A simple user friendly mail service that runs on any computer, tablet or smart phone.</p>
<p>- Emails with automatic Encryption and Signature. (NO ENCRYPTION KNOWLEDGE REQUIRED)<br/></p>
<p>- Encrypted Emails that can be sent to ANY standard email (gmail, yahoo...etc).<br/></p>
<p>- Receive Encrypted emails from any MAIL1CLICK user.</p>
<p>- Send and Receive emails with Fully Encrypted Attachments/Files. <br/></p>
<p>- FREE SERVICE up to 1GB of space. </p>
<p>- An OPEN API to allow Software Developers to do business on it. <br/></p>
<p> Once the initial version is released we will spend as much time necessary to fix any bugs, additional features and work on different languages. </p>
<p>If we are not fully funded we will still work on MAIL1CLICK but it may take more time as we will have to take on other deals to support the ongoing costs of business, ourselves and our families. </p>

<p>I am Beri, a citizen of planet earth. I am a physics PhD, specialized in nanotechnology and an additional background in nanomaterial chemistry. I have a passion for music, dance, architecture, travel and foreign cuisine. I am the founder and CEO of a startup company called NanoArC Limited - NanoArchitecture &amp; Consulting (<a href=""http://www.nanoarc.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.nanoarc.org</a>). We change the atomic arrangement (architecture) within nanomaterials, to give them previously unexpected properties so as to be able to develop innovative technologies.</p>
<p> Why am I doing this project? I believe that technological advancement can proceed without the depreciation of our environment or natural resources. That toxicity is a primary concern for technology today and this should be fundamentally addressed as a prime responsibility for every technology developer. Nature serves us with its resources, the least we can do is preserve its integrity as we improve our lives technologically. Hence, technology can serve as a symbiotic asset for both nature and mankind as a whole. My vision is to foster the development of cost-effective, sustainable technologies for humankind. To live in and leave behind a world that understands that technological advancement should be a solution, not a threat to the preservation of the integrity of humanity and this planet as a whole.  To understand that tech intelligence can serve to improve life quality and should be eco-sustainable, not rendering existent lifeforms artificial or extinct.

<p>The sun shines everywhere and yet despite all our technological advancement, energy is often only available at stationary locations. Energy needs are on the rise and somehow, energy supply is becoming more expensive and less reliable. There are people in many third world countries who own mobile phones but have no electricity connected to their homes. The abundant and intense sun is mainly being used to dry food grain rather than generate power. As for developed nations, snow storms, hurricanes and tropical storms rip through northern parts of America and Southeast Asia every year, causing power outages and damages that scale in the hundreds of millions of dollars. It is time we pick up the hints from nature and upgrade to sustainable living.<br/></p>

The Challenge: 
Effective and timely communication is a mesh that holds society together. Hence, in this campaign, we start with portable technologies. Smart mobile systems such as phones, iPads, tablets and certain medical devices are reliant on batteries for off-grid operation. Batteries are toxic, heavy & have a limited energy lifespan.

Funds: The requested funds will be used to cover for staff, purchase equipment and buy material to develop the technology to a mature state for the market.
   What We Need & What You Get  The funding will serve the purpose of buying material (~ 15%), equipment (~ 45%) and covering for a team of highly skilled scientists & engineers (~38%) to get the technology into the market (~ 2%). The TS-Port is being designed with a new kind of nanomaterial recently developed. It is nontoxic, light, air stable and quite intriguing in its properties. Whatever amount is achieved from this process will be invested to keep the sustainable energy growth in motion.


You get affordable advanced solar technology scaled to your budget to meet your point of need.
You become part of a global movement for sustainable energy and the preservation of our world heritage.

   The Impact

Solar technology is mainly applied to large-scale platforms (e.g. rooftops, solar farms) with substantial installation costs that most people can not afford. With the transparent solar port (TS-Port) technology, many users will have access to an elegant gadget (the image is just a small component of the device) which is portable and provides energy to their phones, iPads or tablets be they at home or on the go. The sun shines for all and all should benefit from it however small, through a miniature-scale system like the TS-Port.
Even if your country is not always sunny, daylight does come and even if you can't invest in a large solar panel, this is your chance to still benefit from solar technology at your own personal level.

Energy will be available to you more readily than a wifi connection - the sun does not require a code, neither does it send a bill. Your onetime cost for this gadget will be in its purchase. From then on, nature covers the rest.

We should thank all of your great support! In return, we will start a thanksgiving customer feedback event. Everyone can get a gift from us. From Nov. 23 to Nov. 30, you can directly get another free button,(besides the one attached with czur scanner that you bought)  once you share our indiegogo on your facebook, twitter or google+. There is one click share button on the left of campaign video. The button is a useful accessory for CZUR scanner, which normally can click 200,000 times.  In addition, a blogger told us CZUR scanner can even help kids with dyslexia or dysgraphia. You can read more about it at:http://www.toysaretools.com/2015/10/crowdfunding-alert-czur-how-one-super.htmlWe have adjusted our stretch goals.We will set two stretch goals:1, if we can reach a $800,000 USD stretch goal, we will send 30 free CZUR scanners to schools.2, if we can reach a $1,500,000 USD stretch goal, we will send 80 free CZUR scanners to schools.Please share this love with your friends and family. You do not need to back us with money - one click/ share (left icons of the video) may help some dyslexia kids!You can also comment us or send email to us to nominate the school you think we should send the free scanners to. We believe scanners should be faster, smarter, and easier to use.We believe that scanners can scan not only pages, but also books.We believe that technology should be accessible for everyone.  Therefore, we spent nearly 3 years redesigning the scanner and have been able to make this dream come true.  CZUR is the world’s first true smart scanner. CZUR is also the fastest scanner in the world. It can scan books easily, connect to WiFi, and serve as a video projector.

We are a startup company with a strong technical background. We have three core technical persons in charge of hardware, software, and architecture – they all have more than 14 years of experience. Our algorithm engineer has been focusing on image algorithm for 13 years; he has provided technical support to numerous well-known companies. All of our team members have a deep understanding of both hardware and software.
When we planned to develop a fast and easy-operating smart scanner,we tried many ways; not only solving the problem of book scanning, but also making the common document scanning easier. We know that Google has done some hard work on book scanning, but we think it might not be the best way, we want to make the device easier to use, and affordable. This way, more people can enjoy the new way of scanning and build their own private library.
We spend a lot of time redesigning the structure of the scanner - to adapt to documents, books, and so on.
To make it a perfect fit for curved paged documents, such as books, we adapted the algorithm and have tested it over a hundreds times.
To make scanning fast, we use the CMOS imaging principle, and choose SONY's 16M pixels sensor chip.
To solve the slow speed processing problem caused by large amounts of computation, we chose the high speed DSP coordinate with the 1G DDR and 1G flash.

<span>Hi, I am Josh Entner and I am excited to share the story of </span><a href=""http://avatwist.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">AvaTwist</a><span> with you!!!  I</span> am extremely outgoing and will talk, comment, or share on any topic-- no matter how taboo.  I often share my professional experiences and other stories about my life, however, when it comes to my personal information and family, I am VERY private.  Like most people, I use the web all the time for both work and fun.  One day I was looking for some sports stuff and noticed the advertisements were following me everywhere.</h3>

<p><span><img alt=""John of Avatwist"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://avatwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/josh-sports-ads-follow-me.png"" src="""" style=""""/></span></p>
<p>I thought to myself: no big deal it is advertising, but when they started recommending places in my town and surrounding towns I began to wonder  “how do they know that”,  not even knowing for sure who “THEY” are...LOL</p>
<p><img alt=""People with spy glasses"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://avatwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Mag-people.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>After talking with a few people who understand the web and technology, I realized that it was actually something that I had NO control over.  I was not happy for being such a fool and completely in the dark about how the internet operates. </p>
<p>Bottom line, I decided that I disagreed with this and wanted to figure out what to do to protect my privacy.  I had no idea where to begin, but I knew that if I was this upset, others would be too when they realize how vulnerable their personal information and privacy is in their daily web use.  I asked around and quickly realized that many others share my concerns about our information being saved FOREVER on a server somewhere, with a connection back to us and all of our personal information.</p>
<p> <img alt=""Infographic of internet access without AvaTwist"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://avatwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/internet-access-without-AvaTwist-full-picture.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I used my contacts and other resources to arrange a few lunches to present to them and about 500 additional people the concept and logic behind AvaTwist; the response was amazing, and as a matter of fact, many of them including several law and accounting firms are working for almost nothing to help get this off the ground.  I figured that is a great start, and proceeded to ask a few talented people whom I am connected with to join me on this venture, and that is how AvaTwist began!  I have pretty good contacts with a vast array of skills, and have been able to accomplish quite a bit with my own money and their expertise.   </p>
<p><img alt=""Surf Anonymously"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://avatwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/surf-anonomously.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I had this really cool idea for a name; AvaTwist. This means Avatar with a twist-- Avatar meaning your alter ego, and Twist meaning changing your IP address. I had lawyers trademark three things to help us maintain our tag lines and company name. We trademarked “AvaTwist”, our marketing slogan: “Who do U want to be today"", and our pitch phrase which includes our new word “ForNEVER” (meaning it never happened).</p>
<p><img alt=""ForNever"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://avatwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ForNever.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This all happened before the summer, and I was afraid to tell anyone that I didn't know about my idea because I thought someone might steal it. Finally, in August after we built the first version of our website, I realized I have no reason to be afraid. I just need to put it out there. I am a big believer in the power of intention. Anyone not familiar with it; the basic premise is you put yourself out there openly and the things you need will come to you. That is exactly what has happened. I connected with a few people who joined the team and they have given me incredible insight into the technology and a much better understanding of the Internet.</p>
<p><img alt=""Who Do U want to be today? "" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://avatwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/who-do-you-banner.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We were in the process of getting the website and desktop version of AvaTwist built when we had a discussion about how the world is going wireless and mobile. We determined that in order to cover all our bases we needed to have a mobile App available as soon as possible after our desktop version. That brings us to where we are today. I had known about Indiegogo but again was afraid of telling too many people, but I quickly realized it is a perfect fit for my project, building the App for AvaTwist. I do not mind competition because it just validates our concept even more. Additionally, we are working on other ideas for the future that should keep us ahead of any potential competitors.</p>
<p><img alt=""Images of iphone App"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://avatwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/apps-screenshots.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The end result of this tracking is that now I have lost some of my personal freedoms, because now the advertisers bombard me with the information that they think I am interested in. I get the feeling sometimes that my internet surfing becomes one big infomercial for some product a marketer thinks I want. I figured out how to answer my question of “How can I prevent them from knowing who I am AND where I am”. Once I found that answer I came up with the idea for AvaTwist.</p>
<p><img alt=""Logo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://avatwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/avatwist-logo-small-size.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Ok so that is how I started AvaTwist . Now let us talk about what AvaTwist is all about. The Internet used to be a one way communication where we would go to a site and get information, but things have changed big time. Now the sites we visit are now connecting to us and building a profile and SAVING EVERYTHING!!!  To me, being tracked is not something I want or think is very ethical. The two things that I really do not like are when my PERSONAL INFORMATION is sold, and that EVERYTHING IS SAVED FOREVER!! Even if you think you deleted something, it is saved somewhere on the web and tied back to U!! Think of what it will be like in 20 years if we continue giving away all of our information online and our whole life story is there for the WORLD to see.</p>
<p> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://avatwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/eye-who-U-are.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>So here are some general things I have learned about the Internet: I learned every Internet connection has a specific IP address that allows your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and anyone else with the right software to know your exact location. They then cross check this information with other records to find out the names of the individuals in the house or the name of the business. There are many other ways we are being tracked on the internet, anytime you put in your email address, every time you click on the “I agree” button or answer a question about your hair color, eye color, street address etc. With this information your service provider or any marketer now knows you and where you surf; and they keep track of it. If that isn't bad enough, here is where it gets scarier, the number of entities that are tracking you by the time you have gone to 4 or 5 different websites is now somewhere between 100 and 150. Then they take all the information that they have gathered from your searching habits and turn around and sell it to anyone who is interested in buying it. Worse, there are companies that combine the information from many marketers to get a better picture of you, which is then sold for more money. This is all LEGAL; never mind the companies and people that are illegally stealing your personal information!!</p>
<p>We have patent pending technology that combines two things we believe no one else has ever done before. We “twist” you, changing your IP address (where you are physically) and then mask the real U using Avatars. This also makes it fun because you can be someone else, and deep down we all want to be someone or something we are not.</p>
<p><img alt=""Getting Twisted With AvaTwist"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://avatwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/getting-twisted.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> You can have as many Avatars as you want.  In early beta testing my friend Brittni uses three Avatars; one for her friends and family to connect with her to share pictures and other things she doesn't want to share with the rest of the WORLD as Brittni.   The second one is for her to be whomever she wants to be and NO ONE knows who she is.   The third one is an Avatar of herself…. Brittni, so she can use Social Media and other types of Online services to stay connected with her business contacts and to reconnect with people from her past. </p>
<p><img alt=""Brittni Talking about AvaTwist"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://avatwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/3-app-Brittni.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> The big key to our success is ease of use. Our user interface is simple and easy to use, if it was complex like our back-end software, then no one would use it. We have developed a simple two step process to get “Twisted” and choose your “Avatar”. To me, this will be a big difference in how successful we are. We really think there is a need for our product but if it is hard to use people will just continue business as usual.</p>

<strong>EASY to use!</strong> Almost no learning curve since kids and parents already know how to use the smartphone camera! </li>

<strong>Helps PROTECT your phone. </strong>It is durable, dirtproof and features rubber grips for those little hands. Protective screen allows you to still access the smartphone screen as you normally would (including slots for the home button and rear camera - for most phone sizes). </li>
<li>
<strong>Encourages ACTIVE play.</strong> Kids immediately want to take photos in the real world when they play with the Pixlplay camera.</li>
<li>
<strong>Encourages CREATIVE play and TEACHES PHOTOGRAPHY </strong>with included activities.</li>
<li>
<strong>QUALITY images </strong>and LED screen on your smartphone will take substantially better photographs than digital toy cameras on the market!</li>
<li>
<strong>Includes companion iOS app.  </strong><strong>Also</strong><strong> works with your existing camera app and any photography app</strong> available in the App or Google Play store.  If our stretch goals are successfully funded, Pixlplay will include activity cards, a sticker sheet and an Android app!</li>

Some Android phones require setting up the camera shutter to be controlled by the volume button.  Also works with Windows mobile devices.Let's make use of all those smartphones!At this point, most families have an old smartphone (or two!) sitting in a junk drawer somewhere. Let’s get those smartphones into the hands of kids in a way that encourages photography and active play.Smartphones have made photography a normal part of our daily life. Smartphones have become the gateway into photography for very young kids as well. Kids are eager to shoot their own photos and play with images. Pixlplay teaches photography while safely containing your phone. Why Pixlplay? 

EASY to use! Almost no learning curve since kids and parents already know how to use the smartphone camera! 

Helps PROTECT your phone. It is durable, dirtproof and features rubber grips for those little hands. Protective screen allows you to still access the smartphone screen as you normally would (including slots for the home button and rear camera - for most phone sizes). 

Encourages ACTIVE play. Kids immediately want to take photos in the real world when they play with the Pixlplay camera.

Encourages CREATIVE play and TEACHES PHOTOGRAPHY with included activities.

QUALITY images and LED screen on your smartphone will take substantially better photographs than digital toy cameras on the market!

Includes companion iOS app.  Also works with your existing camera app and any photography app available in the App or Google Play store.  If our stretch goals are successfully funded, Pixlplay will include activity cards, a sticker sheet and an Android app!
 It's ideal for…

Toddlers.  Pixlplay will be tested for kids ages 3+. Pixlplay helps protect your phone from your youngest of kids and the rubber handle helps improve dexterity and fine motor skills.

Ages 3-5. The working shutter button and knobs with clicking sound teach cause-effect connection and the included activities teach cognitive skills and creative expression.

Ages 6+. Photography is very popular among kids ages 6-9 and the Pixlplay™ activities teach kids about the fundamentals of photography.

Even adults! The classic 35mm camera design appeals to everyone! 
  Includes a Sticker SheetEach Pixlplay camera will include a sticker sheet like the one pictured below so kids can decorate and personalize their camera.   Our JourneyOur first design looked very much like a kids' toy. After several focus groups, we realized kids -- and parents -- want their toys to look more like the real thing! What resulted was a design that is both sophisticated and fun. It gives a nod back to the past with a classic 35mm look including film advance knobs while having a playful look to appeal to kids.Exterior Dimensions (at furthest points): 7 x 4.5 x 2.68 inches (179 x 115 x 68 mm) Interior Dimensions (maximum outside phone dimensions): 
Largest = 5.59 x 2.91 x 0.374 inches (142 x 74 x 9.5 mm).

<p>In 2016, Gaze Lab launched the Gaze Desk, the smartest standing desk ever. The ingenious combination of premium hardwoods, ergonomic design and smart IFTTT-enabled technology, propelled the project to raise over $150,000 on Kickstarter. This makes it one of the top four sit-stand desks in Kickstarter history and the company continues to sell the Gaze Desk at its Gaze Store outlets in Korea and internationally on the IndieGogo Marketplace. In 2018, Gaze Lab returned with the GiiroMat and Giiro Posturebot, two posturetech products designed to make it safer and more enjoyable to spend the day standing at a desk.</p>
<p><br/>Now, Gaze Lab is launching the GAZE TRAY, the world’s first wireless charging storage solution that can charge up to five devices at the same time. And it looks phenomenal.</p>

Our Story
 

In 2016, Gaze Lab launched the Gaze Desk, the smartest standing desk ever. The ingenious combination of premium hardwoods, ergonomic design and smart IFTTT-enabled technology, propelled the project to raise over $150,000 on Kickstarter. This makes it one of the top four sit-stand desks in Kickstarter history and the company continues to sell the Gaze Desk at its Gaze Store outlets in Korea and internationally on the IndieGogo Marketplace. In 2018, Gaze Lab returned with the GiiroMat and Giiro Posturebot, two posturetech products designed to make it safer and more enjoyable to spend the day standing at a desk.
Now, Gaze Lab is launching the GAZE TRAY, the world’s first wireless charging storage solution that can charge up to five devices at the same time. And it looks phenomenal.
 
 
Rock-Solid Track Record 
 

 


 

Gaze Lab CEO Juyoun Lee has 13 years of experience in the tech field, including 8 years at Samsung. The 30-person strong Gaze Lab team has launched two successful Kickstarter campaigns, is currently selling three products on the Indiegogo Marketplace, and sells multiple products on Amazon and in Korean retail outlets - GAZESHOP.

<p>VixPlug combines a double or quadruple power strip with an easy-to-use mobile app to fully automate all your home appliances - including lights, security systems and kitchen appliances - from your tablet or smartphone .</p>
<h4>Never come home to a dark house again!</h4>Imagine coming home to a brightly-lit house, at the perfect temperature, with your favorite music playing and wonderful aroma of dinner cooking in the oven! When you plug your appliance into the VixPlug, you can use your tablet or smartphone to wirelessly control that appliance from within the house, or even remotely over the internet from anywhere.You can turn on your security lighting, thermostat, music system and oven before you leave the office so dinner can be ready when you get home!<br/><h4>Design your own interface!</h4>The VixPlug interface is fully customizable, allowing you to design your level of control; from a simple photo of the appliance that anyone can use, right up to complex designs for the more technologically-minded.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/60567/files/20130908100943-House.jpg?1378660183"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><b>1. HOW MANY POWER STRIPS DO I NEED?</b></p>
<p>It really depends on your home and your needs. The more appliances you want to connect, the more power strips you need. VixPlug is made as two- or four-outlet power strips so you have more options.</p>
<p><b>2. DOES IT REPLACE MY CURRENT POWER STRIPS?</b></p>
<p>Not necessarily, but yes, you can have it always turned on and use it as a standard power strip.</p>
<p><b>3. CAN ANYONE SET UP VIXPLUG?</b></p>

What is VixPlug?
VixPlug combines a double or quadruple power strip with an easy-to-use mobile app to fully automate all your home appliances - including lights, security systems and kitchen appliances - from your tablet or smartphone .
Never come home to a dark house again!Imagine coming home to a brightly-lit house, at the perfect temperature, with your favorite music playing and wonderful aroma of dinner cooking in the oven! When you plug your appliance into the VixPlug, you can use your tablet or smartphone to wirelessly control that appliance from within the house, or even remotely over the internet from anywhere.You can turn on your security lighting, thermostat, music system and oven before you leave the office so dinner can be ready when you get home!Design your own interface!The VixPlug interface is fully customizable, allowing you to design your level of control; from a simple photo of the appliance that anyone can use, right up to complex designs for the more technologically-minded.

What makes VixPlug so great?

You can control any appliance wirelessly, via the Internet any time you are connected.


You can create your own interface very easily. Take a picture of an appliance on your tablet or smartphone camera, select any object in that picture and set up the interface to control it. There are no limits to your creativity.


User friendly controls. Anyone can use our product, whether young, old, gadget geeks or technophobes - you decide the level of complexity.

Control each plug individually. Basic commercial power strips are controlled as a whole unit. With VixPlug, you can turn each one on and off separately.
Set a different timer for each plug, so you can program your oven to switch on for dinner and your coffee machine to switch on in the morning.
Reduce the cost of your gas and electricity bills by setting all non-necessary appliances to turn off during the night.


You can choose EU or US standard outlet power strips.



Where do you come in?
At the moment, we have a completed and working VixPlug power strip prototype, and we've also got a first draft of the VixPlug product design ready to go - you can see our renders of this sleek design in this campaign.
Now the VixPlug is ready to move to production, and that's where we need your support to get this product into the marketplace. With your help, we can polish our prototype, optimize our production costs and start making some VixPlugs.

</p><p><i></i></p><i>Sincrocam is supplied together with an AC power source inside a carrying bag, keeping it completely protected.<br/>To be able to work with Sincrocam, you will need a ball-and-socket joint with a standard thread for video, and an optional battery with charger in case you want to feed it autonomously, also available here.<br/>Of course, you will need your camera and, for Time-lapse, you will need a simple manual shot control cable for your specific model of camera <i>(<i>Similar to these <a href=""http://www.cablematic.es/Cables-de-sincronizacion-para-DSLR/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.cablematic.es/Cables-de-sincronizaci...</a> )</i></i>This one, together with the one we provide with Sincrocam, will let you use the shot controlled by the slider.</i><p><i></i></p>
<b>2- Can I carry accessories inside the Sincrocam bag?<br/><br/></b><i>Inside the supplied hard case</i><i> there is enough room f, battery 4,600mA (optional),and its charger (optional). Everything fits tightly so that it is easy to carry.</i><b><br/></b><p></p><p>
</p><p><i></i></p>
<b>3- Can I place Sincrocam on one or several tripods?</b><p></p><p>
</p><p><i></i></p><i>Of course, Sincrocam has practical legs to be supported directly on even or uneven surfaces. However, if you want to place it on tripods, there are two standard threads (3/8”) for video tripod, mechanical at the ends to fix two tripods, and another one on the central base supplied, to be used with one tripod only. <br/>It is extremely practical to fix fast anchoring shoes Manfrotto 577 type (optional) or similar to facilitate the assembling and dismantling of the tripods.</i><br/><br/><p><i></i></p>
<p><b>4- Is it necessary to keep the touch screen connected to make a Time-lapse movement?</b></p>
<p><i>No, the tablet or Android smartphone is necessary to program movements in the electronics of Sincrocam, and once used, the touch screen can be disconnected, for example during a long Time-lapse. The built-in electronics in the Sincrocam controls it autonomously.</i></p><br/><p><b>5- When making a Time-lapse, does the Sincrocam control the camera shot?</b></p>
<p><i>Yes, the Sincrocam slider controls the camera shot though a specific shot control cable for the model of camera used (not supplied; only the part connected to Sincrocam is supplied).</i></p><p><br/><i></i></p>
<p><b>6- Can I feed Sincrocam with different types of batteries?</b></p>

el soporte central suministrado, para usarlo con un solo trípode.
Resulta
muy práctico instalar unas zapatas de anclaje rápido tipo
Manfrotto 577 (opcionales) o similar para facilitar el montaje y
desmontaje de los trípodes.
4- ¿Es
necesario tener conectado la pantalla táctil inalámbrica permanentemente para
hacer un movimiento de timelapse?
No, la pantalla táctil inalámbrica es necesaria para programar el
movimiento en el Sincrocam y una vez programado, la pantalla táctil puede desconectarse, por ejemplo, durante un 
Time-lapse de larga duración. El Sincrocam
 se encarga del control de forma autónoma.
5- ¿Para
realizar un Time-lapse, el Sincrocam controla el disparo de la cámara?
Si,
el slider Sincrocam controla el disparo de la cámara a traves de un
cable de disparo especifico para el modelo de cámara usado (no
suministrado, sólo se suministra la parte conectada a Sincrocam).
6- ¿Puedo
alimentar SincroCAM con baterias de diferentes tipos?
Sincrocam recomienda utilizar los packs de baterías específicos que te ofrecemos para garantizar las 
máximas prestaciones del equipo. Así como por motivos de seguridad. Haznos una nueva pregunta clicando aquí",24.0,6,"3 Campaigns

<h1><strong>What is iRing?  </strong></h1>
<p>iRing is an attachable accessory to your smart device that gives you comfort and natural grip of your device. It also can be used as a portable stand for the device.</p>
<h3><strong>Inspiration for iRing.</strong></h3>
<div><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/252/284/c63e093e93248180b7675b244a3b46da_large.jpg?1352430304"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<div>We all have dropped our phones at some point. New devices like iPhone break quite easily since they are made with tempered glass. We have solved this problem with iRing, which is a safety grip that can be simply attached to the device.</div>
<h3> </h3>
<h2><strong>Comfortable grip and prevent damage due to falling</strong></h2>
<div><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/256/519/c1e4db31eab695402b237191d307996a_large.JPG?1352682820"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<div>iRing allows you to handle your device safely without fully grabbing it when in use. </div>
<div> </div>
<div><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/256/521/63e844d1a8e5f6b28b4a7cb0a667dc96_large.jpg?1352682884"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>iRing makes it easier to take pictures with your phone.</p>
<div><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/256/535/80275bfeafbb3f76125e2a67dc7f42ae_large.JPG?1352683603"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<div> iRing’s natural grip allows you to hold your device in any position so you can take pictures in any angle. You no longer have to worry about dropping your phone when in use.</div>
<div>
<h2><strong>Horizontal / vertical stand</strong></h2>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/271/625/3d4131946db751120db2f0bf876ca539_large.jpg?1353413732"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<div class=""template asset"">
<p>iRing also can be a portable stand. The hinge turns 360 degrees and it also can be fixed at 90 degrees. </p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The 90 degree structure is solid enough to resist heavier devices like iPad or other tablet PCs. </p>

iRing is an attachable accessory to your smart device that gives you comfort and natural grip of your device. It also can be used as a portable stand for the device.
Inspiration for iRing.

We all have dropped our phones at some point. New devices like iPhone break quite easily since they are made with tempered glass. We have solved this problem with iRing, which is a safety grip that can be simply attached to the device.
 
Comfortable grip and prevent damage due to falling

iRing allows you to handle your device safely without fully grabbing it when in use. 
 

iRing makes it easier to take pictures with your phone.

 iRing’s natural grip allows you to hold your device in any position so you can take pictures in any angle. You no longer have to worry about dropping your phone when in use.

Horizontal / vertical stand

 

iRing also can be a portable stand. The hinge turns 360 degrees and it also can be fixed at 90 degrees. 


The 90 degree structure is solid enough to resist heavier devices like iPad or other tablet PCs. 

 

 

 

Patent Pending technology!  It is Minimal & effective design. 
Free attachment & removal
iRing can be removable at any time. Since special type of adhesive called Pressure Sensitive Adhesive is used, it not only firmly attaches, but also comes off whenever you’d like without laving any residue.  You can re-apply it over and over again. All you have to do is wiping out the surface with water when it’s contaminated.

<h3>What is Pixicle? </h3>
<p>Pixicle is a photo sharing <b>ecosystem</b> that makes it easy to print, view and share your smartphone photos with the people close to you.</p>
<p>Imagine if you could print your smartphone photos at your local photo lab with a click of a button. Or view all your photos on a 40"", 50"" or even a 60"" TV! How about sharing photo albums or several photos with people on your contact list at a touch of a button? Anything you want to do with your photos is a click away with Pixicle!</p>
<h3>What does it do? </h3>
<p><b>Print </b>- Open up Pixicle on your iOS or Android smartphone and select the photos you want to print. Your phone's GPS will locate the closest photo lab partner, send them the photos you want to print and your photos will be ready to pick up within an hour. The photos sent to them will be in the same resolution as you took them. Pixicle will also have photo editing tools built right in to enhance your photos. No need to switch apps to add effects or remove red eye!</p>
<p>We are already working on getting your photos developed at over 10,000 photo lab locations across the US and Canada. <br/></p>
<p><b>View</b> - <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Pixicle is a small device that you plug into your TV's HDMI input at the back of your television, which connects to your iPhone or Android smartphone via the free app. Once you plug in the device and enter in your wifi password, start the app on your phone and start viewing your pictures on the big screen.</span></p>
<p>If someone else wants to start showing their photos, that’s easy too. Simply stop the app on your phone and they can start showing their photos from their phone in the same way. It becomes a photo sharing experience for everyone.</p>
<p>Pixicle is compatible with any television that has an HDMI input. It doesn't matter if you have an iPhone or an Android device, because the free Pixicle app is available for both. Just connect through your wifi and you can start sharing your photos instantly! </p>
<p><b>Share </b>- Pixicle makes photo sharing made easy. Open up the Pixicle app on your phone and select the photos you want to share. Pick one, two, ten, or how ever many you want. Once you have chosen the photos, select the person from your contact list and hit send. The other person will get a notification that you have shared photos with them and, when they open up their Pixicle app on their phone, your shared photos will be waiting for them.</p>
<h3>About us</h3>
<p>We are a small team in Vancouver, BC dedicated to making interesting and innovative applications that will enhance our user’s daily lives.

The soap from Fight Club, Sex Panther Cologne from Anchorman, Stay Puft Marshmallows from Ghostbusters, and the Eau My fragrance with George Takei, to name a few.  This project is an oven mitt. I originally made a few of these for myself (back in ye olde 2012), but everyone seems to want one. So here's your chance to get one. (actual photos)The molds and tooling are already made and ready to go, so this is a $39 preorder.  If enough people want one of these (450 people, to be exact), I'll place the order. If the minimum number isn't reached, you won't be charged.  Production will take about 2 months, shipping via sea to the Port of Los Angeles will take another 8-10 weeks, at which point the product will be delivered to a warehouse for fulfillment and delivery to your house. Shipping is included within the continental United States. The glove is molded from heat-resistant silicone rubber, so it's one-size-fits most, designed for the right hand.  If your palm is about 4.0"" wide, it should fit your hands with no issues.  (If the campaign goes over 1,000 units, I'll have another mold made for people with larger hands -- if it goes over 1,500 units, I'll make a left-handed version).That's really all there is to it. I don't plan to make a million of these things, so if you want one, this is your chance to get one. cc: PowerMitt.com",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

Navio+ now available!SHOPAll tutorials are made available on our website, as well as source code for drivers. FeaturesThe idea
For the past three years we have been professionally working on a commercial microcontroller based autopilot. Development tools were bulky and debugging was complicated. At the same time the ease of use and development for Raspberry Pi was phenomenal, so the idea to create Raspberry Pi autopilot came naturally.Raspberry Pi is a more advanced and flexible platform than a microcontroller:
Runs fully featured operating system
Easy to extend - just plug in camera, Wi-Fi dongle, LTE modem, etc.
Support for virtually any programming language
Multiple available libraries for computer vision and video processing
Great community support
But autopilot is more than just a computer - it needs ways to sense the world, determine it's position and control actuators. We created Navio to give Raspberry Pi all these capabilities.What's includedIf you pledge for a Navio board:
Navio board
Active GPS\GLONASS patch antenna
Pack of wires with DF13 connectors
SD card image of modified Raspbian with real-time kernel.
A set of open-source drivers for all sensors and controllers.
Example applications and tutorials.
There are several autopilot software projects, based on different technologies, that could be used with Navio. For example ArduPilot team has already made a large effort to make a Linux port. Even though at the moment of shipment there may not be a fully functional autopilot code, we will work on making our drivers compliant with open source projects. Navio will help autopilot developers streamline the delivery of code for Linux to the UAV enthusiasts.Help us by sharingFor an open source project building a community is the key. We are constantly getting feedback from developers all around the world. But many still do not know about the possibilities that Navio brings, please help us spread the word about project by clicking on share buttons. Together we can create the next generation of autopilot platforms.Frequently asked questionsWhat is the difference between Navio and Navio Raw?Navio has u-blox NEO-7M multi-GNSS receiver and preferred for navigation. Navio Raw has u-blox NEO-6T which is GPS only, but provides raw data that can be used for real-time kinematics (RTK) processing. RTK requires second static GPS receiver with raw data or a source of RTCM corrections from a reference station.

Can Navio be used with other boards?
While we primarily target Raspberry Pi there are a couple of boards that duplicate it's form-factor and are pin-to-pin compatible with it - these boards are Banana Pi and HummingBoard and they are quite powerful. Navio can be connected to them, but may require some small modifications to these boards and different mount.",3.0,0,"2 Campaigns

 totally up-end all our pre-conceived notions about what LED lighting 
can do, and where it can go. With the success of Power Panel and Lumenator we plan to 
introduce additional products utilizing our LEDNatural technology.</p>

 believe the Power Panel and Lumenator represent the first products in a true 2nd wave 
of LED lighting technology. We can't wait to see where you take the Power Panel or what you do with it once you get there.<br/><br/><p>We can't get 
there without you. Please help us get the word out, by telling your 
family and friends and through Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc. This

The Go Anywhere, Do Anything LED light at a price you won't believe!

Thanks
 for checking out our Power Panel project! Here
 at ColorRight, we've been making awesome white balance tools and flash 
diffusers for over 5 years. We've even won awards for our ColorRight PRO
 line of color balance tools. 
Now, we want to introduce you to the Power Panel. Recently, we raised almost $60K for our first Power Panel campaign and over $40K on our second Power Panel campaign. This is the last time we plan to offer Power Panel on IndieGoGo. 
So
 far, we have made 3 working prototypes of this 
revolutionary type of LED panel light that works for both photo and 
Video. The Power Panel light is an ultra thin LED panel (.6 inches) that
 has gobs of power (approximately 6000 lumens, 500 Watt Light Bulb). 
Power Panel is also the very first rectangular LED panel to use

are leveraging a lot of the technology and knowledge we gained from our 
Lumenator project in the Power Panel, so we don't need to raise as much 
money to make the Power Panel a reality, but we still need lots of help!
 We are still a small 
family run company. We believe these LEDNatural LED products are the 
best we have ever made.Your Impact & Our Future Plans
We
 think Power Panel and Lumenator are the future of photo & video lighting. By 
contributing you are making a difference in the lives of photographers 
and videographers everywhere. The Power Panel and Lumenator projects have the potential to
 totally up-end all our pre-conceived notions about what LED lighting 
can do, and where it can go. With the success of Power Panel and Lumenator we plan to 
introduce additional products utilizing our LEDNatural technology.
We
 believe the Power Panel and Lumenator represent the first products in a true 2nd wave 
of LED lighting technology. We can't wait to see where you take the Power Panel or what you do with it once you get there.We can't get 
there without you. Please help us get the word out, by telling your 
family and friends and through Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc. This 
site has convenient links for most social sites right here on this page.
Thank you so much for supporting the future of photo and video lighting with your contribution! Please choose your perk using the links to the right.Power Panel vs. LED lights

You can mount QLYX either on the air-vent with a clip. Or on any flat surface using an adhesive pad.
QLYX has built-in Bluetooth Low Energy module to connect to the phone.
On the phone, QLYX holder interacts with QLYX application. It is available for iOS and Android.
QLYX app: (1) auto-launches desired application, (2) collects driving statistics, (3) drops parking pin.
It also has a dashboard with handy widgets: traffic data, driving statistics, weather forecast.

 

 
 
QLYX – is a SMART mount.
Not because it's trendy to use “smart” today, but because it truly has a chip that interacts with your phone. 
Its main purpose is to make your life simpler and more comfortable by taking away the necessity of launching an application before a regular action, like driving. 
The mount is elegant and is accompanied by an application that does all the magic and has a dashboard with handy widgets for a driver.
 

 

 

 
 
A combination of smart mount and application is designed to auto-launch the desired app: navigation, streaming services, or parking place memory.
 
  

Currently the mount auto-launches Waze, Spotify, Uber, Apple Maps and Google Maps, and we are constantly working on increasing the number of applications and widgets to choose from.
 
 

Once parked. QLYX pins your car on the map, so you always know where you've left it.
 

3D touch provides quick access to the Drive Statistics, navigation points and other.
 

With QLYX you will be distracted no more: the mount keeps the smartphone within your field of view, while the application - your hands on the wheel.
 

 
The market is stuffed with mounts looking cheap and limited in colors. We are aiming at offering mount frames in a variety of colors to emphasize your style.  With your help, there will be an option to order QLYX in premium materials: e.g. aluminum, wood, leather or even gold.
 

Our designers have been carefully choosing and experimenting to reach the ideal.
 

0.5 mm thin electrical steel, NFC compatible Q-Plates in 5 colors.
 

Thanks to the unique form, our Q-plates can be attached to the phone any way you want.
 

  
 

 
Every QLYX comes with air vent clip and adhesive pad to provide a perfect grip. Both of them were tested under multiple conditions.
 

 
The adhesive pad can be attached to any smooth surface at any angle with 3M VHB; while air vent clip is made from reinforced steel with a silicone coating to grip any air vent.
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
That’s how QLYX is easily paired with the smartphone for the first time.
 

That’s how QLYX auto launches Waze App without a single touch.
 
 
 
That’s how QLYX opens Spotify App via push notification.
 
 
 
That’s how QLYX gets directions to homework using 3D touch function.
  

 
  
Skeleton view
 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
 

 
QLYX will change your driving experience. While plastic holders are bulky and require time for phone installation and app launching, QLYX is elegant and minimizes the time of routine phone setting for the ride, saving it for you. 
So even if you own a phone holder and are perfectly satisfied with it, you literally don't know what you're missing...

Frames are customizable. One of our goals is to add different colors and materials of frames. We already working on five bright frame colors:- Green mint - Sunny yellow- Sky blue - Juicy orange - Red wine

<p>We all love to hear loud music but carrying large speakers could be painful. Due to which Celtrix came into existence, as we felt there was a need for this product.  </p>
<p>We desired an outdoor portable speaker that was small and audible outdoors. And, we failed to find such product that could fill an outdoor space with big, powerful sound.</p>
<p>So, we created the smallest portable Wi-Fi speaker - Celtrix. With Celtrix you can tune to your music anywhere and anytime.</p>
<p>Celtrix has high-quality sound for outdoor environments and it is small in size.</p>

We all love to hear loud music but carrying large speakers could be painful. Due to which Celtrix came into existence, as we felt there was a need for this product.  
We desired an outdoor portable speaker that was small and audible outdoors. And, we failed to find such product that could fill an outdoor space with big, powerful sound.
So, we created the smallest portable Wi-Fi speaker - Celtrix. With Celtrix you can tune to your music anywhere and anytime.
Celtrix has high-quality sound for outdoor environments and it is small in size.

<p><span> The Section 8 - developers of a new set of headphones with touch and Bluetooth technology can’t think of even one reason why not. And why should they? They have a revolutionary product. And that revolutionary product is coming directly to crowdfunding donors worldwide in a project recently launched to support their efforts to bring the Pro Series Bluetooth Touch Headphone to the marketplace. “Consumers are looking for this kind of convenience - this kind of technology. And we’re here to bring it to them.” said Adam Gemal, CEO of The Section 8. <br/><br/> The Touch Headphone crowdfunding project is slated to bring the product to the forefront. With the finger’s pressure to the earpiece and a vertical swipe up, the unit will turn up the volume in the headphones. Dually, one vertical swipe back down and the volume goes down. The headphones will easily skip music tracks with a horizontal swipe to the right direction to move the track forward. To rewind a track the headphone user would merely slide their finger to the left direction on the earpiece. <br/><br/> The Bluetooth compatibility is fully-charged by connecting a USB wire that is enclosed with the product. A one-hour charge will result in ten hours of play time. Bluetooth, otherwise known as wireless compatibility, and touch features can be used from anywhere between ten to fifty feet from the device and in some instances one hundred feet. With one click of the power button the headphones will pause and re-start music. <br/><br/> “One of the most convenient features is the fact that a user can take a phone call while using the headphones.” added Gemal. “The music will stop and the user can press the power button to pick up the call.” To phone the last outgoing call users can double click the button.<br/><br/> Some of the perks for the project include a pair of headphones in one of the three colors available - black, white or red, a limited edition silver model, and a set with a built in microphone.</span></p>

With the finger’s pressure to the earpiece and a vertical swipe up, the unit will turn up the volume in the headphones. Dually, one vertical swipe back down and the volume goes down. The headphones will easily skip music tracks with a horizontal swipe to the right direction to move the track forward. To rewind a track the headphone user would merely slide their finger to the left direction on the earpiece.  The Bluetooth compatibility is fully-charged by connecting a USB wire that is enclosed with the product. A one-hour charge will result in ten hours of play time. Bluetooth, otherwise known as wireless compatibility, and touch features can be used from anywhere between ten to fifty feet from the device and in some instances one hundred feet. With one click of the power button the headphones will pause and re-start music.  “One of the most convenient features is the fact that a user can take a phone call while using the headphones.” added Gemal. “The music will stop and the user can press the power button to pick up the call.” To phone the last outgoing call users can double click the button. Some of the perks for the project include a pair of headphones in one of the three colors available - black, white or red, a limited edition silver model, and a set with a built in microphone.

<p></p>
<ol>
<li>Calibration - Most existing CO2 Monitors need to see fresh air each few days to do some internal calibration. With a Dual Beam NDIR sensor this is no longer necessary. The sensor can be operated also in places that seldom see fresh air, so that the real CO2 value is always correct.</li>
<li>Connectivity - The device can be easily integrated with any existing Home Automation System over HTTP or MQTT. Also native connectivity to some online services like Thingspeak, Ubidots, IFTTT is available</li>
<li>Price - By optimizing the device for price, you will get a sleek 3D Printed enclosure, no paper box to throw away and no lost money due to marketing campaigns.</li>
</ol> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>To keep the price down i will need to order in bulk (e.g. minimum 50 sensors). There are also one-time PCB-production costs. As well as time spent in designing the hardware and software.</p>
<p>This is why i need you!</p>
<p>Even if the campaign is not successfully funded, i am going to produce the minimum quantity of devices as I am already deep in the topic and want to use those sensors! </p>

<h3>TACTALIS FORWARD DEVELOPMENT SCHEDULE</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Funds raised from Indiegogo
will be used for the first production run of Origin hardware. We expect to
complete final design and hardware preparations by December 2014. Production
will start in 2015 and we're estimating initial production will take 8 weeks.
Those units will be tested for quality assurance and then shipped to customers.</p>

</div></div>","Introducing the Tactalis Origin

A revolutionary computer that lets you feel what you touch

 	Origin is the first tactile computer interface platform that gives people without sight the ability to explore, create, edit and share interactive digital media from a single accessible device. Our groundbreaking platform embeds an array of switchable magnets beneath any LCD panel to instantly create tangible reproductions of images that are normally displayed only as pixels of light. In terms of both use and form factor, the Origin interface is not unlike many tablet computers. To achieve what has not been done before, users who explore content on our touchscreen while holding a metal stylus or wearing a metallic ring on their fingertip, are able to feel the force of the embedded magnetic fields emitted from the display wherever a feature of interest is located.




THE GOAL


With this technology we have created an opportunity to transform Braille publications and hardcopy tactile graphics in the same way that Apple and Amazon have transformed music and books:


We will digitize twentieth century content formats, democratize access to all users, and distribute information better than ever before.


The current best methods for displaying graphical content to blind and visually impaired users are braille and raised line thermoforms. These materials are expensive, static and difficult to produce.

Revolutionary Hardware

The Origin is an all in one computer running Windows 8.1, meaning you can use all of your existing apps and accessories with it.






TACTALIS FORWARD DEVELOPMENT SCHEDULE

Funds raised from Indiegogo
will be used for the first production run of Origin hardware. We expect to
complete final design and hardware preparations by December 2014. Production
will start in 2015 and we're estimating initial production will take 8 weeks.
Those units will be tested for quality assurance and then shipped to customers.

<ul>
<li>The components used in our boards come out of the same factories that supply RS components, Mouser, and Digikey but we go straight to the source. None of our components are 'no-name';</li>
<li>Our team is based in a major manufacturing hub - the exact same place the original boards are made;</li>
<li>We have strong connections with the PCB and component manufacturing community, and every member of our team speaks Chinese which also goes a very long way towards getting things done efficiently;</li>
<li>Instead of organizing manufacturing from afar, we're on the ground on the factory floor. This also has the added benefit of preventing the manufacturer from switching components behind our backs, something that is commonplace and happened to Michael Ossmann himself during prototyping, and we suspect during production too (on at least some boards, <a href=""http://nine.pairlist.net/pipermail/hackrf-dev/2014-November/thread.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://nine.pairlist.net/pipermail/hackrf-dev/2014-November/000866.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">resulting in performance issues</a>);</li>
<li>We've spent 6 months finding and testing components, as well as negotiating favorable terms with manufacturers;</li>
<li>We don't need to make a profit, we just need to cover our costs when giving out free boards; and</li>
<li>We've left out the clock-in and clock-out headers as well as interface/expansion headers on the base version, many have not been using these and want a cheaper option.</li>

Shipping for additional boards is $3-$5 each. Registered express airmail is used for shipping, and delivery times range from 5-14 days. Packages will be marked as computer peripheral trade samples with a minimum value, feel free to let us know if you want something different. Any taxes or duties imposed by the recipient's country are of course the responsibility of the recipient. </p>
<p>We expect to ship sometime in March, however we may be able to ship in late January and will do our absolute best to make that happen. If shipping does not occur in January there's a total shutdown in China during February (the whole month) when everything gets put on hold. Watch the updates on this campaign to see what's happening with manufacturing etc, we will be posting regular updates.</p>
<p>Shipping of perks will occur in the same order that contributions are received.</p>

<h3>Hackerspaces to Receive a free HackRF</h3>
<p></p>
<p>SDR is the spark that will ignite the next generation of RF communications technology. SDR does to the RF spectrum what sound cards did to the audio spectrum, and we got MP3 etc out of that, which is the only reason we now have YouTube, podcasts, iTunes, etc. Who knows what people will think of for the RF spectrum, anything could happen and it's very exciting. People in disadvantaged regions of the world have just as much to contribute in terms of innovation and technological development but have less access to technology. If they aren't able to work with software defined radio, it won't only be them who miss out, but everyone who stands to benefit from the development of radio communication technology. In order to increase access to SDR technology, a number of hackerspaces will receive one free HackRF (or more) at the end of the Indiegogo campaign. We have a list of 26 (and counting) hackerspaces based on how many members they have, how cheap the fees are, and how needy the community is.</p>
<p>We will most likely need to increase this list (assuming we sell all the perks), so please see the background information and requirements <a href=""http://garethhayes.net/hackrf-blue/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://hackrfblue.com/getting-the-blue-into-hackerspaces/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> and suggest a hackerspace that you are a member of, or that you know about, <i>we need your help</i>.</p>Here's a cool stop-motion map showing which hackerspaces we are targeting so far.<p></p>

<h3>No Sweatshop Conditions Allowed</h3>All members of our team have spent plenty of time in Chinese factories and are acutely aware of the conditions faced by factory staff. There's not a lot of point in helping out one community if it comes at the cost of slave labor in another. We are using factories and suppliers that treat their staff well. All staff involved in the production of the HackRF Blue and accessories earn a proper living wage and do not work extended or fatiguing hours. We will be there on the factory floor <i>every step of the way</i> to make sure. <br/>

We will most likely need to increase this list (assuming we sell all the perks), so please see the background information and requirements here and suggest a hackerspace that you are a member of, or that you know about, we need your help.Here's a cool stop-motion map showing which hackerspaces we are targeting so far.


No Sweatshop Conditions AllowedAll members of our team have spent plenty of time in Chinese factories and are acutely aware of the conditions faced by factory staff. There's not a lot of point in helping out one community if it comes at the cost of slave labor in another. We are using factories and suppliers that treat their staff well. All staff involved in the production of the HackRF Blue and accessories earn a proper living wage and do not work extended or fatiguing hours. We will be there on the factory floor every step of the way to make sure. 
FAQ
Q: I want the $200 hackrf blue – BUT I also want the $40 combo. Do I need to contribute twice? Or can I somehow do this in a single order?A: You can add the $40 to your contribution for the HackRF Blue perk, or you can contribute twice, both are acceptable.Q: What happens if I forget to add the shipping fee to my perk?A: You can add this later as an additional contribution (please use the same email address as your perk) or pay it directly through Paypal (contact us).
Q: I’m signed up for the HackRFBlue + mega combo pack + shipping. However, I’d like to change to get the mega combo with shielding… Is there a way that I can do this?

A: Simply add the price difference between the perks you initially requested, and the perks you want, then email hackrfblue@gmail.com with the details of what you have done, along with your shipping address.
Q: When is shipping? I can't find any information on the campaign page.A: Scroll back up, and read again. Pay extra special attention to the section titled ""Shipping and Delivery"" ;-)",17.0,3,"1 Campaign

This provides the security, anonymity and censorship-bypassing power of the Tor network without having to download or configure software. This is the first commercially available router to do this where all the software is Open Source.  </p><p>You could call the anonabox a cloaking device. It not only hides your location and online activity, but also allows uncensored access to the web in places where Internet sites are blocked or monitored. </p><p>Normally to use Tor someone would download software called the Vidalia browser bundle and run it on their computer. Although this allows them access to the Tor network, it only encrypts Internet traffic within that browser, allowing other Internet traffic to leak through from other programs and potentially reveal the persons private information, Internet use and location.</p><h4>How Hard is it to Use?</h4><p>Pretty easy, first you plug in the usb power cable to power up the device a blue LED will come on letting you know its on. Then you plug in a cable to the side labled WAN and connect it to your router. Then with your wireless device (laptops, cell phones, tablets, etc) connect to it wirelessly. That it! If you want to connect by direct cable you plug in another cable to the side labled LAN.</p><p>The anonabox is a physical device a person can plug into that ensures ALL traffic coming out of their computer no matter what is all routed into the Tor network, closing that potential security problem.</p><p></p><h4>

</h4><h4>Who is making this?</h4><p>The lead developer for this device is August Germar, an IT security professional with over a decade of enterprise level security experience as CTO of 2interactive; a conglomeration of Internet Service providers. While there he was responsible for security of a datacenter of corporate servers as well as dedicated and co-located servers for clients and spent countless hours defending them from a wide range of security threats. He now does consulting for business clients ranging from legal firms to hospitals. He also volunteers for the Tor support forum the Tor Stack Exchange, and is an admin for the official Tor project discussion page on LinkedIn. </p><h4>Is this the same device I saw on another crowd funding site?</h4><p>We first made a Kickstarter project for this. Our primary goal was to attract attention from developers who wanted to polish the code and bring a device like this to people who needed it, and maybe even have some fun along the way. We had never done a crowd funding project before, but thought the visibility of the site would help draw attention to the project from the developer community. </p><p>Turns out, most of the people who saw it just wanted the device, but we got a lot of input from developers and the Open Source community as well. </p><p>We never dreamed there would so much interest in this idea! We are happy we were wrong because now the attention and feedback we received was enough to make the device better than ever. The Open Source community rose to the occasion, and concerns were raised about the code for the operating system and configuration. </p><p>Whereas the version posted was a plain vanilla proof of concept for developers like us to work on all the feedback allowed us to make the software better than ever too, and now we have an extremely secure updated version of the software and configs based on an updated version of the Open Source project called P.O.R.T.A.L, which is audited and maintained by one of the most respected members of the security community known as the grugq. We are also incorporating many ideas implemented by Jacob Applebaums work on the Debian branch of the Tor hardware router project to make sure it is as secure as possible. </p><p>Our initial plan was to find people who wanted to work with us on a project to develop these devices, we asked for $7,500 and received 80 times that amount. With this money came an overwhelming influx of support and assistance, as well as scrutiny and criticism, all of which have been helpful in reshaping this new launch of a finalized, polished version of the product.</p><p>Now that we know so many others share our interest in this device we are more excited than ever to get these into the hands of the people who want it. The interest in we saw was inconceivable before it was posted originally, but now that we know the scale of interest we are better prepared than ever to meet that demand.</p><h4>What made it better?</h4><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;"">After the feedback we got from the first crowdfunding campaign we went back to the drawing board and totally started over from scratch.

DESIGN & FEATURES:
Presenting the first and only lithium HyperCharger. It has all the cables you need, generates the power of a wall charger, and at only 5 credit cards thick it will fit in most wallets. In order to revolutionize the way people charge, the LithiumCard had to meet all these goals. 
The exclusive HyperFET drive technology delivers up to 2 Amps of fast and safe energy back into your smartphone or electronic device. Many power hungry smartphones in the market today will have trouble turning back on if not supplied over 1 Amp of current.  Real-time monitoring maximizes the amount of charging, saving you time between charges. The HyperFET circuitry will charge your smartphone's internal battery up to an astonishing 1% per minute. For example, if the LithiumCard is plugged into your smartphone for 15 minutes, your smartphone will have a charge of up to 15%. In addition, the LithiumCard will automatically optimize the device's charging process so there's less time waiting. 
HyperFET circuitry will charge your smartphone's internal battery up to an astonishing 1% increase per minute. For example, if the LithiumCard is plugged into your smartphone for 15 minutes, then your smartphone will have a charge of up to 15% more capacity. 
With the fit and precision of a Swiss army knife, the LithiumCard has a flip-out USB for charging itself. And a pull-out micro-USB, or Apple Lightning connector for charging other devices. All LithiumCard's connectors can be hidden from view when not in use. 
LithiumCard is available in two versions: LithiumCard with a micro-USB connector which works with most Android devices, the Samsung Galaxy S4, HTC One, Nokia, Blackberry and many more. There's also the version with an Apple Lightning connector which works with all Apple iOS devices such as the iPhone 5/5S, iPad 4, iPad Air, iPod Gen 6+. *Please note the LithiumCard with the lightning connector is an additional $5.
Scrutiny to detail is only one part of the puzzle when we designed the LithiumCard. During R&D we extensively tested the reliability and strength to meet real world conditions.
If both your phone and the LithiumCard is out of charge, we have a unique bypass charging system, which allows you to simultaneously charge a smartphone and the LithiumCard’s internal battery. 
LithiumCard charges most popular smartphones and electronic devices today, such as Beats Studio Wireless headphone or Jawbone Jambox Mini. It has an Apple Lightning connector for your iPhone 5/5S, or a micro-USB connector for your Samsung Galaxy S4.Step 1: Recharge itWhen running low, flip-out the USB plug and charge it with any USB equipped charger, laptop, or cigarette lighter adapter.Step 2: Plug itPop out the micro-USB or Apple Lightning connector and connect it to your device.Step 3: Power itStart the charging process by pushing the power button, once the light starts blinking.


Without using adhesives, NanoStik technology keeps the LithiumCard virtually stuck to your device. Over time, the NanoStik can get dirty, simply rinse with water to keep it at maximum ""stickyness"". 
Pressing the power button also indicates LithiumCard's power level. The precision nano-refraction lens display will say it all. White: Over 90% chargedBlue: Over 30% chargedRed: Less than 10% charged.
The LithiumCard is the future of HyperCharging that's available now. It's worth the hype, especially when you have it in 18K Gold!

 God has really blessed me with this opportunity to be equipped and to 
do international sports ministry as well as build leadership skills

Africa, hosted by local ministry, Sports For Christ Action South Africa 
(SCAS) for the entirety of the internship. Training will incorporate 
classroom teaching, team and individual challenges and local ministry 
experiences. I will have the opportunity to receive training from 
experienced sports missionaries and teachers. Topics to be covered 
include: Biblical Basis for Sports Ministry, Cultural Sensitivity, 
Evangelism, Sports Ministry Models and Teambuilding. Interns will also 
engage in practical local sports ministry, including outreaches and 
camps.<br/><br/> I write to ask you to support me in any way that you are
 able.  Prayer is what I need the most, I would ask that you pray for 
the safety of the group during the time we will be gone, and that God 
will use us and our talents to show Christâ€™s love to those who have 
never seen it.  I also ask if you are able, for a financial 
contribution.  Any amount that you feel led to give will be of huge 
assistance.  The cost of the program is $1800 and the round-trip flight 
to South Africa will probably be around $2,000. <br/><br/> I have never 
been anywhere like South Africa before and feel like this season of my 
life would be the perfect time to go.  I am graduating from UNC in May

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I compete at the national level in the motorsport commonly known as tractor pulling. Recently, tractor pulling organizations have begun changing rules to allow electric powered garden tractors to pull against ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) powered tractors. One such organization is the National Quarter Scale ciruit, which now allows electric powered tractors to run in one of their classes.</p>
<p>One of the more demanding things you can do with electric powered vehicles is attach them to a nearly immovable object, which is exactly what happens to the vehicles involved in tractor pulling. I recognized this challenge and welcomed it, eventually using knowledge gained on previous electric conversion projects to build a garden tractor puller that is entirely electric. </p>
<p>I have been active in tractor pulling since I was young, and have used my electric tractor in competition for the last three years. However, my tractor has not yet tapped the full potential of electric and is continually outperformed by its fossil-fueled competitors.  With a battery pack upgrade, I am now ready to change that. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Campaign Details</h3>
<p>The purpose of this campaign is to raise money to buy large cell lithium batteries and the required charging circuitry for them. Any additional funds will go to other upgrades -- for example, an even larger battery pack or an AC motor with the required controller/inverter. If possible, I would even like to be able to give it a cosmetic upgrade with body work to help it resemble its forerunners, i.e. GE Elec-Trak electric mowers produced in the early 70s.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I hope to make electric vehicles and what they can do more visible to the public. With your help we can try and show the true potential of an alternatie way of tractor pulling.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Is there a limit to the number of devices accessing the cloud
at one time?</b></p>
<p>No. Multiple users can
access the drive at once. However, your cloud is only available to those who
you have shared the access information with.</p>
<p><b>What are the mySkiva warranty terms?</b></p>
<p>You can review the mySkiva
warranty terms <a href=""http://skivatech.com/index.php/product-support/warranty"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<p><b>What if I need multiple routers, will you have trouble
supplying my need?</b></p>
<p>No. We have partnered with
a strong manufacturer and should be able to deliver bulk orders on time.</p>
<p><b>Why is privacy such an important issue for cloud services?</b></p>
<p>The information stored in a third-party server provider’s cloud is not
as private as you may think. The following information reveals only a few of
the hidden dangers in using a third party Cloud network rather than your own
private Cloud made possible through mySkiva.</p>
<p>1. 
Multiple copies of the information submitted
into an online Cloud are created and stored as backups in several locations
that may be outside of the Cloud network you signed up for.</p>
<p>2. 
Privacy policies you sign to gain access to an
online Cloud service make your “private” Cloud space not so private –- many
policies allow the server provider to use your stored information. You
technically don’t own the rights to information you’ve stored into the Could
after you’ve submitted it.</p>
<p>3. 
When you push “delete,” you may think the files
have disappeared. However, if you use an online Cloud, you’re files are still
floating around and might be accessible to others even after you think you’ve
deleted them.</p>
<p>4. 
Your media is on a provider’s server with an
online Cloud but where are the servers exactly? Since many services have
multiple networks interconnected in other states and countries, it’s impossible
to know exactly where your files are being stored.</p>
<p>5. 
You’re not the only one signing privacy policies
and terms of use. Your server provider also signs certain privacy policies with
other companies when they use other services, which can complicate things a bit.
With all of these policies granting access to files flying around it’s hard to
know who’s actually looking at your stored information.</p>

All Skiva apps have been subject
to multiple cycles of development, testing, and improvements. In an unlikely
event if you face any issue with the apps, our engineering team will respond
quickly with a solution.



How You Can Help

We’ve made a tremendous
product, but we have even greater plans! Now we need your support to:


Run a cost efficient mass production so that we
can offer the mySkiva at an affordable price;

Finish our implementation of Android apps.



Don’t forget, all
improvements/updates for the mySkiva app software or router firmware will be
offered to our backers free of charge forever!




With your help, we can reach our stretch goals. This will allow
our team to develop improvements that expand your cloud access beyond your USB
hard drive! 



The Remote Desktop Option will allow you to access any
computer on your home network from anywhere in the world. 



The Home Network Share Option will
allow you to open any shared folders and files on your home network from
anywhere in the world. This feature would be available as part of the cloud
app. No computer necessary!



The Remote Media Streaming Option will allow you to
stream video and music remotely from your phone! Currently, you will be able to
stream video and music from your local network, but if you are outside of your
personal wifi network, you will download the file before viewing. 



The Remote Access IP Cameras Option will allow you to
view live feed from your IP cameras at home!

Frequently Asked Questions

Is there a limit to the number of devices accessing the cloud
at one time?
No. Multiple users can
access the drive at once. However, your cloud is only available to those who
you have shared the access information with.
What are the mySkiva warranty terms?
You can review the mySkiva
warranty terms here.
What if I need multiple routers, will you have trouble
supplying my need?
No. We have partnered with
a strong manufacturer and should be able to deliver bulk orders on time.
Why is privacy such an important issue for cloud services?
The information stored in a third-party server provider’s cloud is not
as private as you may think. The following information reveals only a few of
the hidden dangers in using a third party Cloud network rather than your own
private Cloud made possible through mySkiva.
1. 
Multiple copies of the information submitted
into an online Cloud are created and stored as backups in several locations
that may be outside of the Cloud network you signed up for.
2. 
Privacy policies you sign to gain access to an
online Cloud service make your “private” Cloud space not so private –- many
policies allow the server provider to use your stored information. You
technically don’t own the rights to information you’ve stored into the Could
after you’ve submitted it.
3. 
When you push “delete,” you may think the files
have disappeared. However, if you use an online Cloud, you’re files are still
floating around and might be accessible to others even after you think you’ve
deleted them.
4. 
Your media is on a provider’s server with an
online Cloud but where are the servers exactly? Since many services have
multiple networks interconnected in other states and countries, it’s impossible
to know exactly where your files are being stored.
5. 
You’re not the only one signing privacy policies
and terms of use. Your server provider also signs certain privacy policies with
other companies when they use other services, which can complicate things a bit.
With all of these policies granting access to files flying around it’s hard to
know who’s actually looking at your stored information.",11.0,6,"2 Campaigns

Founded by Paul Darbee and Larry Pace, DarbeeVision is a small intellectual property company that licenses its high definition video processing technology and develops innovative new image enhancement products. 
DarbeeVision has developed a proprietary, patented technology that brings a revolutionary, never-before-seen level of depth and realism to any image.  By integrating Darbee Visual Presence into existing digital image media devices, pictures become better than what even the most advanced cameras and displays can achieve. 

The resulting improvements go far beyond what fidelity improvements alone can do for image realism. Because the results are embedded in the pixels of an image, the process can be applied any time during the life of the image. 
In the next year DarbeeVision
has the opportunity to significantly improve the products of two major
industries that impact people's everyday lives.
1. Safety and Security

Our
new Reveal technology will help clarify low-quality images
from surveillance cameras to improve the analysis of video footage.  Because
Reveal creates a profound level of image clarity, details that were
previously obscured are enhanced.  Fog, haze and poor light
conditions are automatically compensated for. Imagine how much more quickly criminals could
be identified and apprehended with high resolution imagery.
Demo of Darbee Reveal Technology for security video:


2. Medical Imaging 
Our new Probe technology will greatly assist doctors and medical technicians in the diagnosis and treatment of all types of maladies by enhancing images to produce added realism, depth and clarity.  Probe will improve ultra-sound, X-ray and MRI imagery. 




Probe will create
video and images that are easier for clinicians to see and understand. 
Your health and well being rely upon medical professionals being able to make
good decisions about the details they see in the images of your body. 
Probe dramatically helps them do that.
This is an example comparison image of Darbee ProbeTechnology for X-ray imaging:


DarbeeVision is seeking your help to bring both of these important technologies to market. 

Our
Goal and the Offer
We are seeking $100,000 in
contributions.  Your contributions will

tooling and other non-recurring start-up expenses.  In a nutshell, you

<h3>What is GetCharitable? </h3>
<p>GetCharitable is a tech startup that sustainably funds non-profit charities through the power of mobile apps.  We don't think anybody has to single handedly change the world if we can all chip in and make a difference.  How can we convince everyone to chip in?  Easy!  By downloading a free app called GetCharitable anyone can help non-profits work around the world.  </p>
<p>We don't want non-profits to have to ask for donations and we don't think people should have to give out of pocket when GetCharitable can do the work and use advertising dollars to help non-profits.  </p>

</div>
<div>
<h3>Why are we raising money? </h3>
<p>This isn’t a just a donation.  This is an investment in the future, so GetCharitable never has to ask for donations down the road.  </p>
<p>GetCharitable needs to raise money to continue the development of the app to grow and help others around the world.  Without this development, GetCharitable might never reach its potential and we don't want to let that happen!  </p>
<p>Not only do we need to continue to develop and update the app, but we are trying to get the word out about GetCharitable.  We are raising money for marketing to tell everyone about how they can do good with a free app.  Your contributions will be directly helping spread the word of the project you believe in!  </p>
<p>Many tech startups in our shoes seek private equity investment from people that expect quick returns on their money at any cost.  GetCharitable doesn't fit this mold, because we want to help others first and foremost.  That's why we are raising money from like minded supporters like you, whose first goal isn't to see a quick profit.  </p>

<p>GetCharitable is a tool for people to crowdfund non-profits through the use of their mobile devices, without having to give any money!  The GetCharitable app can only make a big difference through the help of many pooling together.  That’s why we think crowdfunding is the perfect way to fund GetCharitable – because we use the same philosophy! </p>

<p>Some may worry about Flexible Funding and wonder why we chose it for this campaign.  The following are our reasons:</p>
<p>First, our team believes we will succeed in our campaign with the help of everyone who pays attention to and supports us, like you.   We also want to thank anyone who doesn't provide a financial contribution but helps promote our vision of delivering a high-performance SBC at low cost.</p>
<p>Secondly, even If we can’t achieve the $10,000 USD campaign goal we set originally, we will still send out a Lemon Pi board to every contributor in order to become friends with every one of our backers and will reply to every e-mail sent to us.  All funds we receive are very highly valued toward our dream coming true, although it's a tough way to achieve a low price via mass production.</p>
<p>We will keep our promises to every contributor to this campaign, whom we want to treat like our first investors.  We will not break the heart of anyone who helps us, even though that would result in financial losses in our business, or even make us go bankrupt at startup.  We will send a Lemon Pi to every contributor at the promised price as your perk.  We believe it's worth the effort to make you completely satisfied with our product.</p>

<h2><b>Remember to select a shipping choice</b></h2>
<p>Because the price of the Lemon Pi board does not include the shipping cost, you will need to add that cost to your pledge, $5.00 USD for Hong Kong Post, or $30.00 USD for DHL Express Shipping.</p>
<p>You can fill $5 or $30 in customer dollars blank in Additional Gift as shipping cost.</p>

Lemon Pi to join our forum to meet other open-source software and hardware
enthusiasts, receive news, and obtain updated information about the Lemon Pi
and associated software.

What is the Lemon Pi?The Lemon Pi is a very low-cost open source single-board computer (SBC) equipped with a powerful  ARM quad-core Cortex A9 microprocessor integrated with an Imagination PowerVR SGX544 GPU.





The Lemon Pi currently runs Android 5.0 and Ubuntu 12.04 and the board is the same size as and has hardware interfaces compatible with the famous Raspberry Pi SBC that inspired us to build our system. 



The Actions S500 System on a Chip (SoC) that powers the Lemon Pi is from the ActDuino open-source  chipset series.  The Lemon Pi provides HDMI, 100BaseT Ethernet, one USB 3.0 plus two USB 2.0 ports, a micro-SD/TF card interface, MIPI Display Serial Interface (DSI) and Camera Serial Interface (CSI) ports without extra circuitry, all on a very precisely laid-out compact printed circuit board (PC).  Because the Lemon Pi has 40pin General Purpose (GPIO) interface compatible with that on the Raspberry Pi, hundreds of existing I/O expansion boards for the Raspberry Pi can be used with the Lemon Pi directly and conveniently.





Regarding software, we will offer a full open-source software development kit (SDK) for the S500 SoC provided by Actions, except for the NAND-flash driver and multimedia codec driver.  However, Imagination will provide complete open-source support for its PowerVR SGX544 GPU driver and graphics acceleration on Linux.
In order to ensure the quality of the Lemon Pi, one of the top-rated manufacturers in Taiwan will manufacture its motherboard.  We are using only electronics components of the highest pedigree, so we are completely confident about the stability and quality of our boards.



Who is the Lemon Pi for?






What can I do with the Lemon Pi?
With a quad-core Cortex-A9 ARM microprocessor manufactured using a 28nm process and the Imagination PowerVR SGX544 GPU on the Lemon Pi, 1080p@60fps HD decoding capability, and abundant, easy-to-use, expansion interfaces, users can create innovative Android and Linux based products and software via the Lemon Pi development platform.







Technical Specifications
It's widely known that the SoC on an SBC greatly influences the performance, cost, expansion interfaces available, and peripherals that can be accommodated.  In most cases, it’s very difficult to achieve a balance between performance, functionality, and price.  We were delighted to discover the Actions S500 SoC from the ActDuino open-source  chipset series, which satisfies these requirements much better than other SoCs.

The S500 is an open-platform, quad-core, 32-bit SoC featuring a highly integrated design, high-performance computing, low-power consumption, low cost, and robust peripheral support.  The S500 SoC integrates a quad-core ARM Cortex-A9R4 microprocessor with a NEON SIMD co-processor and Imagination PowerVR SGX544 GPU.  This SoC provides powerful performance, can support a 2K @ 60fps (1920 × 1200) LCD plus 1080p HDMI dual-screen output.  In order to serve the various needs of the open-source market, the S500 SoC has rich peripheral interfaces that provide users with convenient expansion, and it's integrated with multiple-speed USB ports, I²C, SPI, UART, I²S, PCM, SPDIF, MIPI DSI / CSI, HDMI,  100BaseT Ethernet and other ports on the Lemon Pi.
Lemon Pi provides all of the standard video format 1080p@60fps decoding playback capabilities. For H.264 format, up to 4K*2K can be supported. Particularly, most of H.265@1080P video can be supported. The Lemon Pi also supports open-source home theater software like XBMC (Kodi) so that you can enjoy rich multimedia using the Lemon Pi.

Timeline 

We launched the project in November 2014, and you can get the information about the Lemon Pi's birth process from the following table.





In memory of the
first version of the Lemon Pi (the green board), you can see some jumper wires
on the board.

      Stewar
I have a Master's
Degree in Computer Science, with a lot of experience in software and hardware
systems in brand-name IT companies.  I love using all kinds of development
boards (especially the Raspberry Pi) for the development of open-source projects. 
I hope more makers can enjoy using the low-cost, high-performance Lemon Pi
development board for various projects.

      Pino


I research
machine learning and computer vision, having received my PhD from the
Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at the University of South
Carolina (SC).  My favorite research topics include deep learning, human
action recognition, facial expression recognition, and so on.  In my spare
time, I am also interested in embedding various computer vision algorithms into
open-source platforms in order to apply computer vision to a variety of
applications.  I believe the performance  of the Lemon PI satisfies
demanding computing needs at a reasonable performance/cost ratio.

Saying thanks


It takes more than the Embed Studio team to make the Lemon Pi possible as there are many amazing people at Actions Semiconductor who have helped along the way.  We want to express many thanks to the entire Actions team based in Taipei, Zhuhai, and Shenzhen.  We could not launch the Lemon Pi as quickly and smoothly as we have without their incredible help.




""Lemon Pi, Amazing computation power in such a little package!“

Risks and challenges



The black board you see above is the second generation of the Lemon Pi, which is the mass production version you will receive.  The first generation is the green board with some bugs to be fixed.  The first version produced has been working excellently, and we have fixed some hardware and software issues to create the second-generation black board.  We believe the principal risk of not being able to deliver on our promises is very almost none.

As the production cycle of the board is typically one month. the Lemon Pi is expected to be delivered in August, 2015, about one month after the end of the campaign in July, 2015.  We will keep progress updated among all of our backers.
Some may worry about Flexible Funding and wonder why we chose it for this campaign.  The following are our reasons:
First, our team believes we will succeed in our campaign with the help of everyone who pays attention to and supports us, like you.   We also want to thank anyone who doesn't provide a financial contribution but helps promote our vision of delivering a high-performance SBC at low cost.
Secondly, even If we can’t achieve the $10,000 USD campaign goal we set originally, we will still send out a Lemon Pi board to every contributor in order to become friends with every one of our backers and will reply to every e-mail sent to us.  All funds we receive are very highly valued toward our dream coming true, although it's a tough way to achieve a low price via mass production.
We will keep our promises to every contributor to this campaign, whom we want to treat like our first investors.  We will not break the heart of anyone who helps us, even though that would result in financial losses in our business, or even make us go bankrupt at startup.  We will send a Lemon Pi to every contributor at the promised price as your perk.  We believe it's worth the effort to make you completely satisfied with our product.


Remember to select a shipping choice
Because the price of the Lemon Pi board does not include the shipping cost, you will need to add that cost to your pledge, $5.00 USD for Hong Kong Post, or $30.00 USD for DHL Express Shipping.
You can fill $5 or $30 in customer dollars blank in Additional Gift as shipping cost.


If you forget adding $5 or $30 extra shipping cost when selecting your perk at beginning. You can come back to select another perk for shipping. For example, when you select ""$35 standard LEMON PI"" perk, and only contribute $35 not including shipping cost. You need to select  another ""$5 Hong Kong post or $30 DHL"" perk on this campaign.

Why we need your help? 
And other Ways You Can Help us
Only when we place an order for a large quantity to the manufacturer can we obtain the low price for everyone who wants to buy a Lemon Pi.  However, we're a startup team with limited funding to support ourselves.  So, we're launching this crowdfunding effort to encourage you to help us make our dreams reality.

Of course, your financial contribution will be very much appreciated, and we also look forward to receiving your feedback and suggestions in any respect regarding the Lemon Pi.
We will further develop the Lemon Pi on a continuing basis to meet the demands and wishes of everyone registered as potential customers.  If you can't make a financial contribution, please don't hesitate to let us know that you're closely following the development of the Lemon Pi.  Any suggestions and comments are highly appreciated, and please send them to info@embedstudio.com and embedstudio@qq.com
We sincerely encourage contribution to our project and help spread the Lemon Pi sharing spirit of open-source, hand-making, and education.  
You are welcome to become one of the volunteer partners within our team at Embed Studio. Please contact us by Email immediately! Lemon Pi community expects your joining in us wherever you are.
Many thanks in advance!",24.0,0,"1 Campaign

Now with self-cleaning technology, it’s the Swiss-Army knife of screen protectors.Ocushield’s new iPhone 12 screen protector is specially formulated to self clean your phone screen, so you can keep swiping safely,Its technology breaks down viral structures - the same way hand gel works. Since lockdown measures began, we now spend 200% more time than normal looking at screens. This means more blue light exposure and more protection needed.Some negative effects of blue light include:Dhruvin Patel, a qualified optometrist and the creator of Ocushield, researched this problem back at university in 2015 and developed Ocushield’s original products. This range filters out harmful blue light while maintaining a crystal clear image - unlike software solutions such as night mode. Blue light blocking software is simply not effective. Plus, it turns your screen orange! With Ocushield products, you notice the difference. Your eyes feel refreshed and less strained - even when you spend the whole day looking at screens.Did you know that time on screens can also affect your body’s ability to produce melatonin, the chemical that helps you fall asleep?Spending time on screens late at night can trick your body into thinking it’s still daytime! Luckily, with Ocushield’s blue light filtering technology, you can still spend time on your phone or in front of the TV late at night, without disrupting your sleep.Unlike competitors, Ocushield products are created by Optometrists and are actually proven to filter out harmful blue light. They’ve been registered as a class 1 medical device by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), an executive agency of the Department of Health and Social Care in the UK.Built to protect your phone first, Ocushield is as tough as nails, made from strong, tempered aluminosilicate glass. Ocushield screen protectors bring you extra protection! Protect your screen from chips, scuffs and scratches - and keep your phone in top condition.Ocushield has an oleophobic coating. This is an oil repellent coating that reduces smudges from greasy hands. It keeps your screen clear and clean, so you can love using your phone again.Modern work doesn’t work without screens. But, the negative effects of all that blue light can impact productivity. With Ocushield, you can spend time on screens without getting headaches or dry eyes - as well as getting a better night's sleep. This can boost productivity, so you get more done. Ocushield products are used by employees at major companies throughout the world such as Google, Facebook, JP Morgan, The NHS and more.There’s no denying that technology plays a vital part in all our lives, especially for our kids. Whether it’s studying, playing or spending quality time with the family - let’s be honest, there’s often a screen involved.Children are at greater risk from blue light, as the damaging effects of blue light can be worse for their developing eyes. Time on tech can also affect their sleeping patterns - making bedtime routines rather difficult. That’s where Ocushield’s products come in.We all spend a lot of time on our phones, whether it’s watching Netflix, reading the news or scrolling Instagram. With Ocushield, you can spend as much time as you want on screens, without all of the nasty things that come with it. 4 layers for extra protection…

<p><br/></p>SUMMARY

<p>ARED
(African Renewable Energy Distributor) offers a means to bridge the gap between
the haves and have-nots of electricity in East Africa. It all started when I
took a trip to Burundi. It became almost impossible to find a reliable way to
charge my cell phone, but after a few days I was back home and the minor
inconvenience had passed. It dawned on me a week later that, while I had the
luxury of returning home to a stable electrical grid, SOME of the people of Burundi
lived each and every day without that service. What presented an inconvenience
for me presented an insurmountable roadblock to consistent communication
outside of Burundian’s neighborhood.</p>
<p>As
a man whose family hails from Rwanda, just north of Burundi, this struck home.
After weeks of research I could find nothing that offered solutions for
reliable, low-cost energy for anything more than an individual. While a
household solar panel sounds nice on paper, it’s naïve to think that someone
living on $2/day could afford that. So I decided to build my own solution.<br/></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""326"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/LYGTjghyf9M?feature=oembed"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p>In
2009 I paired up with a designer to fill that vital gap in energy availability.
Together we came up with a blueprint that would offer the operator mobility,
dependability, simplicity, and—most importantly—a low-cost means for him or her
to generate an income. In 2010 I found an engineer to help me bring this idea
to life. And so the Mobile Charging Kiosk (MCK) was born. </p>

<p>I
moved back to my home country, Rwanda, to get the project off the ground,
investing all of my money, my time, and, effectively, my <i>life</i> into this project. I’m happy to say that, at the moment, we
can’t keep up with demand. I’m even happier to see the same faces coming back
day after day to our MCK. What seemed like a simple solution for people like
myself to <br/>
“top off” their batteries had grown to something entirely different. As more
and more people came to charge their batteries from 0-100%, I realized that the
MCK was their <i>only source of electricity</i>.
My customers would come in at first light, head to work, run back to us to
retrieve their charged phone, and run straight back to work. The infrastructure
in Rwanda simply does not provide reliable electricity to everyone's homes, meaning
their uncharged mobile phones are useless, meaning they remain out of contact
with friends, family, coworkers, and business. </p>
<p>We
produced five units of the prototype in the past six months, and our operators
have already helped us work out the kinks. These five will remain in operation,
serving both rural and urban markets, but the time has already come to cut the
fat and streamline our product. </p>
<p>Meet
the new and improved MCK:</p>

<br/><p>We
trimmed down the body to give it a sleek, eye-catching chassis to attract
customers. By swapping the two thin wheels with a thicker, sturdier,
all-terrain tire we’ve allowed better control when hauling the MCK with a bike.
This also enabled us to train the wheel directly to the kinetic charging
element: now the battery will charge while the operator transports the machine
each day. With a simplified panel system, the operator can more logically
organize charging phones and our secondary products (airtime credit, mobile
phones, etc) on shelves.</p>
<p>Unfortunately,
designers and engineers don’t work for free. We’ve set our franchise fees as

<p><b>What We Need</b></p>
<p>We
need $30,000 to start Phase II of our project. Phase I designed, implemented,

applied to Phase II. </p>
<p>Here’s

</span>$10,000 will cover our
fees to designers and engineers that are breaking their backs to maximize the

will pay the taxes and shipping if you can help us provide those rural areas
with MCKs.</p>
<p>By
supporting this campaign you have a number of amazing perks to choose from
including your name on the device, a certificate and photo of the device you
help purchase, and even a trip to visit us.</p>

<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>According
to the National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda, the percentage of families
in the country that owned at least one mobile phone jumped from 6.2 to 45.2 (an
increase of 39%) in only five years (2006-2011). While the market of mobile
users is rapidly expanding, the number of households with access to Rwanda's electrical
grid is not. The country aims to expand electrical grid access from 16% to 50%
of the population by 2017 but, for the time-being, around 40% of households in
Rwanda have a mobile phone but no steady electricity to charge it. Current
expansion rates suggest that mobile penetration will continue to outgrow
electrical penetration, and the number of mobile users without electricity in
their homes will increase accordingly.</p>
<p>Our
vision for ARED is simple: create an environmentally sustainable product of our
own design, engineering, and production. Producing a product for Africans <i>in</i> <i>Africa</i>
will greatly reduce the lag time we currently face in delivering our machines
and, more importantly, it will create jobs for Africans. MCKs will be produced
by African employees and delivered to African franchisees, fighting local
unemployment and promoting entrepreneurship in the areas that need it most. </p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>We
understand that not every person can finance a whole MCK on their own, so we
ask that you support ARED’s mission in any way you can—even if that means just
spreading the word and making some noise about our campaign! Tell your friends,
tell your family: we’re looking for franchisees in East Africa and for
investors worldwide!</p>

While the virus is out of our control, we each have a small part to play in the collective response to the outbreak. We started to ask: what could we have done differently? What can we still do differently?</p><p>We found our answer in a crucially underutilized element: copper. Copper and its alloys are naturally, powerfully antimicrobial. ""Metallic copper surfaces kill microbes on contact, decimating their populations... they do so literally in minutes by causing massive membrane damage after one minute of exposure,"" according to this paper from the American Society for Microbiology.</p><p><i>For more information on the science behind copper alloy, <a href=""https://aeris.one/about"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">click here.</a></i></p><p>Our next challenge was determining how we could best put this to use. Germs can be found nearly anywhere, so where do we start to fight back? After hours spent scrolling on our phones during quarantine, we realized the answer was in our hands the whole time. </p><p>The average smartphone user touches their phone about 3-6 times per minute. With over 25,000 bacteria per square inch, many phones are dirtier than the average toilet flush handle.</p><p>Phones are classified as fomites, a technical term for an object that is known to be a culprit in disease transmission. Dangerous particles can live on your phone for days and require constant attention. The Copper Case starts continuously killing harmful microbes on contact, including those on your hands. A copper phone case is not a cure, nor a fail-proof preventative measure for coronavirus. Still, germs cannot survive on the surface.</p><p>We hope to make copper a staple of personal products, homes, and businesses, in an attempt to mitigate the future spread of germs that cause, for example, sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Along the way, we will donate one case for every case sold to medical workers, our heroes battling this crisis on the front lines.</p><p><i>For more information on our mission, <a href=""https://medium.com/aeriscopper"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">check out our blog.</a></i></p><p> </p><h3><strong>Story</strong></h3><p>We're college seniors who knew we wanted to make a difference in fighting the pandemic. With few resources besides time, we began researching every angle that might lead to a solution. When we discovered the largely unknown antimicrobial properties of copper, we knew we were onto something. More research revealed that by putting copper in everyone's pocket, we hoped we could intercept and destroy SARS-CoV-2 particles before they had the chance to infect others. It soon became clear that the best way to do this was by attaching it to the one thing everyone always has with them — their phone. And so we came up with Aeris.</p><p>Aeris, the latin word for ""copper,"" is a nod to the material that makes this phone case possible. By backing this Indiegogo campaign, you're backing our commitment to reducing disease transmission now and for the future. Like all great endeavors, we started out in a garage. Our first model was designed on an iPad, and we are 3D printing the first prototypes ourselves. </p><p> </p><h3><strong>The Case</strong></h3><p>We wanted the Copper Case to fit seamlessly into everyday life, and with that in mind we designed it to physically protect your phone just as well as it kills microbes.  Our 2-layer design features a soft-touch, impact-absorbing liner with a hard copper exterior, able to withstand tough drops and impacts. </p><p>The case will be available in a <strong>variety of colors</strong>, starting with black and white. We will reach out with options to confirm your preference before shipping a case.</p><p><strong>Our Alloy</strong></p><p>While pure copper is effective at disinfecting surfaces and killing microbes, it is not practical to use in a cell phone case.  However, our research has shown that alloys with as low as 70% copper as just as effective for disinfection as pure copper. Our alloy retains the disinfecting properties of copper but with increased strength, durability, and practicality.</p><p><strong>Will this stain my skin/clothes?</strong></p><p>Metals with high amounts of copper, often found in jewelry, are known to have a staining effect on human skin. There are a few ways we have been able to address this. First, our copper alloy is blended in order to limit skin staining without compromising on protection. Second, staining is accelerated by buildup of moisture and oils on the metal surface. Regular cleaning with a cloth will reduce staining and keep your case in good shape.</p><p><strong>Won’t copper interfere with my phone reception?</strong></p><p>Conductive surfaces like copper are known to interfere with phone signals.  This was one of our major design challenges, and a major concern for our prospective customers.  We addressed this problem in two ways. First of all, our Copper alloy is significantly less conductive than pure copper, which reduces the shielding effect.  Secondly, and most importantly our case design leaves key areas uncovered, allowing signals to move freely while disinfecting the areas of your phone that need it most.  We have been testing the case ourselves without any negative effects since we created our first prototype.</p><p><strong>Aren't there already antimicrobial phone cases?</strong></p><p>While other cases may allege to have antimicrobial properties, these are often extremely limited to the point of being nonexistent. Their formulas are kept secret, and they do little to back up their claims.

In order to make sure our heroes are protected, we are donating one case for every case sold to frontline healthcare workers who will benefit most from the proximity of copper surfaces.*Please note: We view Aeris as just one tool in our arsenal against this pandemic, and we are not making any specific claims that the case will diagnose, cure, treat, or prevent coronavirus, COVID-19, or any other illness. We are sharing existing government-backed research and academic studies about the nature of copper. This case is in no way intended to substitute for precautions or other guidelines suggested by the CDC, such as social distancing and hand washing — all of those precautions should still be observed. Image 1: One of our prototypes.  BackgroundThe pandemic has introduced countless new challenges and continues to inflict lasting damage, worst of all the deaths of thousands worldwide. While the virus is out of our control, we each have a small part to play in the collective response to the outbreak. We started to ask: what could we have done differently? What can we still do differently?We found our answer in a crucially underutilized element: copper. Copper and its alloys are naturally, powerfully antimicrobial. ""Metallic copper surfaces kill microbes on contact, decimating their populations... they do so literally in minutes by causing massive membrane damage after one minute of exposure,"" according to this paper from the American Society for Microbiology.For more information on the science behind copper alloy, click here.Our next challenge was determining how we could best put this to use. Germs can be found nearly anywhere, so where do we start to fight back? After hours spent scrolling on our phones during quarantine, we realized the answer was in our hands the whole time. The average smartphone user touches their phone about 3-6 times per minute. With over 25,000 bacteria per square inch, many phones are dirtier than the average toilet flush handle.Phones are classified as fomites, a technical term for an object that is known to be a culprit in disease transmission. Dangerous particles can live on your phone for days and require constant attention. The Copper Case starts continuously killing harmful microbes on contact, including those on your hands. A copper phone case is not a cure, nor a fail-proof preventative measure for coronavirus. Still, germs cannot survive on the surface.We hope to make copper a staple of personal products, homes, and businesses, in an attempt to mitigate the future spread of germs that cause, for example, sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Along the way, we will donate one case for every case sold to medical workers, our heroes battling this crisis on the front lines.For more information on our mission, check out our blog. StoryWe're college seniors who knew we wanted to make a difference in fighting the pandemic. With few resources besides time, we began researching every angle that might lead to a solution. When we discovered the largely unknown antimicrobial properties of copper, we knew we were onto something. More research revealed that by putting copper in everyone's pocket, we hoped we could intercept and destroy SARS-CoV-2 particles before they had the chance to infect others. It soon became clear that the best way to do this was by attaching it to the one thing everyone always has with them — their phone. And so we came up with Aeris.Aeris, the latin word for ""copper,"" is a nod to the material that makes this phone case possible. By backing this Indiegogo campaign, you're backing our commitment to reducing disease transmission now and for the future. Like all great endeavors, we started out in a garage. Our first model was designed on an iPad, and we are 3D printing the first prototypes ourselves.  The CaseWe wanted the Copper Case to fit seamlessly into everyday life, and with that in mind we designed it to physically protect your phone just as well as it kills microbes.  Our 2-layer design features a soft-touch, impact-absorbing liner with a hard copper exterior, able to withstand tough drops and impacts. The case will be available in a variety of colors, starting with black and white. We will reach out with options to confirm your preference before shipping a case.Our AlloyWhile pure copper is effective at disinfecting surfaces and killing microbes, it is not practical to use in a cell phone case.  However, our research has shown that alloys with as low as 70% copper as just as effective for disinfection as pure copper. Our alloy retains the disinfecting properties of copper but with increased strength, durability, and practicality.Will this stain my skin/clothes?Metals with high amounts of copper, often found in jewelry, are known to have a staining effect on human skin. There are a few ways we have been able to address this. First, our copper alloy is blended in order to limit skin staining without compromising on protection. Second, staining is accelerated by buildup of moisture and oils on the metal surface. Regular cleaning with a cloth will reduce staining and keep your case in good shape.Won’t copper interfere with my phone reception?Conductive surfaces like copper are known to interfere with phone signals.  This was one of our major design challenges, and a major concern for our prospective customers.  We addressed this problem in two ways. First of all, our Copper alloy is significantly less conductive than pure copper, which reduces the shielding effect.  Secondly, and most importantly our case design leaves key areas uncovered, allowing signals to move freely while disinfecting the areas of your phone that need it most.  We have been testing the case ourselves without any negative effects since we created our first prototype.Aren't there already antimicrobial phone cases?While other cases may allege to have antimicrobial properties, these are often extremely limited to the point of being nonexistent. Their formulas are kept secret, and they do little to back up their claims. Even when they do, they can take up to 24 hours to work, rendering them essentially useless. Copper and its alloys are EPA registered, and scientifically verified to start killing viruses, bacteria, and other microbes on contact, which is why we have made every effort to showcase the science behind our case.Case OptionsPhones come in all shapes and sizes. We’re working hard to offer as many options as possible, so no one is prevented from taking advantage of our products — especially doctors and nurses.  Our current offerings include most iPhone and Samsung Galaxy models. The TeamAeris was founded in 2020 by three soon-to-be graduates of Vanderbilt University with Majors in Engineering, Economics and Public Health.

RISK AND CHALLENGES  I have no doubt in my ability to accomplish this work with excellence.  I have a sound advisory board, relevant professional experience and excellent business education.  I am creative, strategic and determined. In the last five years I have invested in innovative products and business ideas, mostly related to education that are waiting for investment. 
 My greatest challenge is that I can't do it without you.
 Perhaps that is the beauty of entrepreneurship, that no one can say ""I did it all by myself"".  This  propels successful entrepreneurs to continue to pay forward so that others may succeed.  As I learned, It takes money to make money, create jobs and a vibrant economy.  
  Other Ways You Can Help Because one of the goals of this campaign is to validate ZIPPYeCard product demand, you can help me by sharing this link with your endorsement to all your friends in your social media channels. 
 Your referral together with a contribution of  any amount it is all that takes to make this campaign a success -  THANK YOU!",6.0,2,"2 Campaigns

<br/><p></p><p></p><p><b>[16 Dec. 2013]</b></p><p>Please let me explain more about the background of Auto Unpluger and the reason why I need to build this thing:<br/></p><p>According my measurement most of the phone and pad with keep taking power (around 100mA depends) after 100% battery charged. Since the phone software designed to keep the 100% figure, the phone only can draw power from adapter and operate the phone as long as you unplug the power source manually.<br/></p><p>In my point of view this is not a good feature because I really no need to keep the battery 100% all the time by wasting the adapter powers. For the same reason, I designed the Auto Unpluger to eliminate this ""phantom power"".<br/></p><p>The down side of using Auto Unpluger is you may not get 100% battery level when you wake up since the adapter already cut few hours ago. Also, it will ate some power for operating the MCU inside and energy loss by the extra internal resistance on both input and output connectors.</p><p>So, if you have same consideration, Auto Unpluger will fit what you need. <br/></p><p>Thanks a lot.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>[14 Dec. 2013]</b></p><p>Testing with New iPad and original 2A adapter and USB cable</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/260362/files/20131214055711-ipad_1.jpg?1387029431"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Charging data (around 1.4A)<br/><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/260363/files/20131214055743-ipad_2.jpg?1387029463"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Testing with New iPad and general 1.5A adapter and USB cable<p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/260367/files/20131214060244-ipad_3.jpg?1387029764"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Charging data (around 1.5A)<br/><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/260369/files/20131214060320-ipad_4.jpg?1387029800"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Testing with Sony Z ultra and iPad original 2A adapter<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/260374/files/20131214060519-SONY_ZU_1.jpg?1387029919"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>Charging data (around 1.1A)<br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/260377/files/20131214060559-SONY_ZU_2.jpg?1387029959"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><b>[13 Dec. 2013] </b><br/></p><p>I just got 1st and 2nd perks from my friends, thank you very much!!</p><p>Sorry that I forget to tell you the completion date of Auto Unpluger development on the perk description.

Also I upgraded both input and output USB socket to USB3.0 for higher current capacity.[28 Dec. 2013]Here I have the new update on the plastic casing of Auto Unpluger.The new PCB will fit on this plastic case without tooling cost.The LED will simply to 2pcs. (Green for Operate / Orange for Current level)The control button will simply to 1pcs. (Toggle Start / Stop)[26 Dec. 2013]Merry X'mas and Happy New Year!!Here I have the 2nd test video of Auto Unpluger about the cutoff test.The video show how the Auto Unpluger detect and unplug (cutoff) the power source when the Pad charged up.Remark: The 0.058A (58mA) current level is the operating current of Auto Unpluger

[22 Dec. 2013]First test video - Start and Stop test of Auto UnplugerThe video show the Auto Unpluger can stop the current flow by Start and Stop buttons manually.
[16 Dec. 2013]Please let me explain more about the background of Auto Unpluger and the reason why I need to build this thing:According my measurement most of the phone and pad with keep taking power (around 100mA depends) after 100% battery charged. Since the phone software designed to keep the 100% figure, the phone only can draw power from adapter and operate the phone as long as you unplug the power source manually.In my point of view this is not a good feature because I really no need to keep the battery 100% all the time by wasting the adapter powers. For the same reason, I designed the Auto Unpluger to eliminate this ""phantom power"".The down side of using Auto Unpluger is you may not get 100% battery level when you wake up since the adapter already cut few hours ago. Also, it will ate some power for operating the MCU inside and energy loss by the extra internal resistance on both input and output connectors.So, if you have same consideration, Auto Unpluger will fit what you need. Thanks a lot.[14 Dec. 2013]Testing with New iPad and original 2A adapter and USB cableCharging data (around 1.4A)Testing with New iPad and general 1.5A adapter and USB cableCharging data (around 1.5A)Testing with Sony Z ultra and iPad original 2A adapterCharging data (around 1.1A)[13 Dec. 2013] I just got 1st and 2nd perks from my friends, thank you very much!!Sorry that I forget to tell you the completion date of Auto Unpluger development on the perk description. The best delivery schedule should be ON OR BEFORE MARCH 2014 since most of the component vendor and OEM factory will be close during End of Jan. 2014 for Chinese New Year holidays. I will try my best to keep on this target.For all perker, please remember to include the shipment cost (USD10-) on your perk since I cannot effort to do free shipments. Thanks a lot.What is Auto Unpluger?It is a crazy ideas start from a one cold night when I painfully wake up and try to unplug the adapter. You know the result always mass up when you try to catch your phone on the dark...I think the main point on it just unplug the wire but it may not always need human to do.I believe I can design a little device to detect the current and isolate both 5V and Ground wire with a Relay when my phone charge up.Since Relay can physically disconnect the contact of 2 wires, the result just like unplug the wire by hand but in elegant way. Sounds good on this and I build a prototype to test my idea!It works and I can plug and forget my phone and have a good sleep~Some people never thought plugging the phone over night is a problem, but I am quite worry about to leave the charger overnight with some Lithium battery over my head...Recently some news in Hong Kong report a serious fire cause by over-heated adapter at night time and claims life. It really get my attention to figure out the better way to take care on my charging act everyday.What Auto Unpluger can do?
Charge up your phone / pad by most of 5V power source supply up to 500mA
Monitoring the charging current and disconnect both 5V and Ground line after charge up
Isolate your phone to power source physically to reduce risk of electric shock
Maximum charge timer cutoff even your phone not stop charging
Rough level display on the charging current via LEDs
Auto detect the phone type and match the charging scheme (Iphone, Samsung, Blackberry...)
Extra protection on surge voltage from power sources (lighting, unstable power line...)
Block for data stealing by isolate the input D+/D- pins 
Detail current, charge time and charge capacity report from serial port output
What Auto Unpluger cannot do?
Cannot detect the actual battery voltage inside your phone
Cannot start charging without press the ""START"" button
Cannot speed up the charging time
Cannot withstand over 25VDC input but fuse protected

Why I need you help?The first hardware prototype of Auto Unpluger is completed.Right now I working on the circuit improvement and software development.Still have some minor technical issue on the accuracy of current detection and USB charging scheme; anyway just matter of time.Also, I would like to seeking on your help to define some software features. I will post some ideas and please leave comment to me what you prefer.The most preferred idea will be the final software, I think this is the best way to make everyone happy~If you like my idea, please support my project and select the perks you like!If I got 1 perksI will carry on the development on the hardware and firmware improvement. 2 handmade samples (1 for you and 1 for me) will be build to play around. Thanks your support !!If I got 100 perksI will have enough fund to build another PCB for final circuitry and handmade all 100pcs.It may take a moment because it won't have enough fund to go for the OEM factory.It is not easy to make 100 peoples in the world agree on you, I really enjoy on this.Many Thank you !!
If I got 400 perksI am consider it is a totally success if I reach this point.I will have enough fund and quantity to go for the OEM factory and build them all. The unit will have better SMD quality and reliability. I will find a designer to make the 3D drawings on the plastic casing ifthe fund still enough to do so.I really hope this little idea can change your life in better way.Thousand Thank you !!
If I got 1000 perksIt really a awesome results on this project! I will have enough fund to make the toolings!When it finish, every Auto unpluger will receive a simple and nice plastic case.Also I need to work out the timeline to match both PCBA and plastic case assembly.It is a huge challenge on me but I will try my best to make everyone happy.Superb Thank you !!! 
Shipment
We can ship it for worldwide major city and I never make money from shipment.Most of the case I can do it for flat rate shipment but on some remote site I may have special handling on the shipment fee.More Technical stuff of Auto UnplugerI am quite sure you have interest on my idea if you still reading on this line.Let me share more technical information about my project:
Maximum withstand input voltage (without breakdown): 25VDC
Maximum operation charging current allow: 1.5A DC at 5.2V Input
Maximum voltage isolation between Relay open contacts: 1000VAC at 1 min.

<ol>
<li>
<p>You are more likely to have a Peacekeeper Mini in-hand compared to other self-defense
products because of its dual purposes (flashlight+pepper spray).</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The Peacekeeper Mini spray delivery method, based on previous TigerLights, have shown documented stop rates of 96% because of its concentrated powerful formula, the spray pattern and most of all, the element of surprise. This results in a far greater and more immediate effect on the respiratory system resulting in a more potent incapacitating effect, particularly on drug impaired individuals. </span></p></li>
<li><p>The Peacekeeper Mini mimics and assimilates your natural response to an act of aggression, which is key in a high stress situation.<br/></p></li>
<li><p>The Peacekeeper Mini can be used on multiple attackers as opposed to other self-defense products.<br/></p></li>
<li><p>The Peacekeeper Mini’s effect lasts 30-45 minutes, giving you enough time to get away.</p></li>
<li><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">With the hand strap, a person is less likely to be one of the 90% who drop their weapon or self-defense device during a physical attack.</span></p></li>

<p>Below is a computer generated 3D image of the hand strap, in a variety of colors, that will come with your Peacekeeper Mini.  It will be a soft, pliable material that will stretch over your hand and secure the light to your hand comfortably allowing you to actually use your fingers while the light is in hand.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Unfortunately, attackers do not broadcast or announce their intent to attack.  The victim often does not realize he or she is being attacked until physical contact has been made. Given that 90% of people will drop their weapon in a sudden, physical attack, the hand strap becomes critically important.</p>

<p>We started the Peacekeeper Mini Project in early 2013 and have moved steadily forward ever since.
We know the self-defense industry and after thorough research, we know that this product is
what’s missing. Through hard work, we are ready to bring the newest TigerLight® product to
the public with a new and improved design.
</p>
<p>Speaking of designs, they are done. As you can see, we have completed that part of the process and we are ready to move forward to the manufacturing stages. This is where we need
your support. We have proven ourselves as a mainstay in the industry and we are ready to
introduce the Peacekeeper Mini to you. </p>

And, it has to remain in hand during an attack. <p></p>
<p>When it comes to high performance and beauty, Ferrari comes to mind and David Wiener has designed many incredibly beautiful, high performance products for Ferrari and is, himself, an avid sportsman, even designing a world-record-breaking bicycle ridden by Olympian Eric Heiden.</p>
<p>Everything has been taken into account from the positioning of the light switch and spray, the contour, width and length of the light and the materials, while accommodating people’s natural mental and physical response to an attack.</p>

<p>We developed this product because we want everyone to feel safe, regardless of their situation.
With your help, we can save lives and bring increased safety and peace of mind to millions. Your
support will allow us to create not only a high quality and proven self-defense product, but one
that’s affordable for everyone. You can protect your loved ones by giving them the Peacekeeper
Mini. </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Help us make a difference.
</h2>
<p>We have been supplying military-grade products to policemen for the past 13 years, but our
goal is to get the same quality of product into your home for a fraction of the price.
</p>
<p>In order for us to do this, we have to order the components and machinery needed to begin
manufacturing in bulk so we can drive the cost per Peacekeeper Mini down. The bottom line is this:
if we can manufacture for less, we can sell it for less.  The more successful the campaign, the lower the retail price.  Help us make it possible for everyone to afford one.</p>
<p>We ask you to think of those you love and fund a cause that has the potential to save the lives
of millions. </p>

<p></p>
<span style=""""><p>A January 24, 2014 New York Times article states: “Mr. Obama gave his task force 90 days to recommend best practices for colleges to prevent or respond to assaults.”</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>A subsequent report from <i>The White House Council On Women and Girls</i> titled <i>Rape and Sexual Assault: A Renewed Call To Action</i> dated January 14, 2014 detailed, among others, the following solution:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<i>Launched the </i><b><i>1 is 2 Many</i></b><i> Campaign to focus on teen and young-adult sexual violence. Among a number of other initiatives, the Campaign inspired the creation of the “Circle of 6” app- which puts a group of friends instantly in touch with each other, so someone in trouble can send a “come and get me” message, complete with GPS location map.</i>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>TigerLight has responded and surpassed this initiative with a tiny, pocket-size device that is like having multiple personal bodyguards with backup teams on call. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Why do we need it?  One reason is that 1 out every 5 girls on college campuses are raped and its getting worse, not better.  </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Imagine a young coed walking to her car from the library, a small flashlight in hand. She is confronted by a rapist. In a blink of an eye two things happen; a “crowd alert” with her photo and GPS location appears on the screens of 200 other student's cell phones in the vicinity, including the campus security, and they all run immediately to her rescue only to find the would-be rapist writhing on the ground, incapacitated, but not injured.  This is the Peacekeeper Mini, a proprietary, patented self-defense device, affordable to students and based on street proven technology, tried and proven by our military and police.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Help us make sure that White House is aware that the solution can be found in the Peacekeeper Mini project on Indiegogo.</p>
<p><b>O.U.R. Rescue</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Self Defense For Everyone:  Every teacher and administrator in our schools, every student 18 or older, every jogger, hiker, walker and everyone else old enough to use one. Think about what this could mean!</b></p>
<p><b>Our NEW partnership with Operation Underground Railroad (O.U.R.) is to help spread the word about this amazing new product. Although this campaign's purpose is to fund the production of the Peacekeeper Mini and reward YOU for helping do that, TigerLight has participated in many charitable causes and we do not know of any cause more important than O.U.R., so we are working together to promote the Peacekeeper Mini campaign while also donating 20% to rescue children, right now. If you do not want part of your contribution to support O.U.R. you can select a PERK that does not include O.U.R.</b></p>

<p><b>What happens if the campaign does not reach the minimum campaign goal?</b></p>
<p>ANSWER: The money is all returned to the contributors.</p>
<p><b>Will the spray still work if the battery goes dead?</b><br/></p>
<p>ANSWER: Yes.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Is the money deducted out of our account the moment we pay?</b></p>
<p>ANSWER: Yes, is it held by Indiegogo until the end of the campaign and then disbursed to TigerLight if the campaign reaches a minimum of $50,000 and returned to the donors if it does not.  That is supposed to take place within 15 days after the end of the campaign.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>How is the light turned on?  I do not see the light button on the side like the other TigerLights.</b></p>
<p>ANSWER: The light and the spray are both operated with the thumb.  It is a new patent pending design.  Both approaches work extremely well but we are excited about this design.  We had been getting lots of requests from the professional industry, here in the US and in Europe, to have the switch under the thumb like many of the new, small tactical lights.  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The problem was that it would not work unless the light and components were very small.  In the Peacekeeper Mini, it works PERFECTLY.  If you have your thumb on the light button, the spray button is behind and above, so you will not accidentally push the spray button.  You have to raise your thumb up a little and push it back slightly to get over the spray button to push it down.  The really cool part is that you can also rest the thumb over the spray button, resting on an interior side ledge.  This is the position one would want to be in if exposed to potential attack.  In this position the thumb is slightly cocked at an angle with the thumb knuckle right over the light button.  Without moving your thumb position, all you have to do is ""un-cock"" or straighten your thumb and operate the light with the underside of your thumb knuckle.  It is very intuitive.  We have tried it with rapid prototypes and men and woman with small and large hands can operate it very comfortably and easily.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Will the Peacekeeper Mini have a holster?</b></p>
<p>ANSWER: We plan to make carry options for every situation, for the arm, wrist, waist, ankle, purse, bike.  We emphasize the great importance that the Peacekeeper Mini be in your hand when things go bad, and retention is also very important.  However, we realize it is not going to be in your hand in every situation and every environment, so we want to make it convenient, comfortable and quickly accessible at all times, whether at the beach or the prom, work or play.  Our goal is that it is with you whenever your cell phone is and we know that is nearly 24/7. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>What if I do not have a PayPal account.  Can I still purchase (donate)?</b></p>
<p>ANSWER: You can contribute to our campaign via PayPal, even if you do not have a PayPal account. Use your credit card to ""Pay as a Guest"" without signing in to PayPal with a password: </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>When you get to the PayPal screen, you'll see up top ""Choose a Way to Pay""</p>
<p>Select the second option: ""Pay with a debit or credit card""</p>
<p>Complete the form - PayPal accepts Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and American Express</p>
<p>Deselect the checkbox that says: ""Save this information with a PayPal account""</p>

<p><span>Note: Residents of Utah may be subject to sales tax.</span></p>
<p><b style=""font-style: italic;"">Is there a temperature range the product works most effectively in?</b></p>
<p>ANSWER: Every canister manufacturer recommends that it not be stored above 120 degreed F.  Our canister in our other lights were tested for the military by Eastern Laboratories in ten degree increments for an hour and only one canister failed after 55 minutes at 212 degrees fahrenheit. I have sprayed canisters after leaving them out in the snow all night in temperatures of about 5 degrees fahrenheit.  They sprayed fine.  Although a minimum temperature is not mentioned, some say it can be as low as -5 degrees F.  I suspect that our sprays from Sabre Red and Guardian PD, given that they are not water based and are non-flammable, and are both used by the military and police, may have very low freezing points.  Also, given the fact that the canister is contained in the flashlight and not exposed to direct sunlight, it is likely to withstand both higher and lower temperatures.</p>
<p><b>Does the Peacekeeper Mini have a strobe mode?</b></p>
<p>I received a private comment suggesting that we have a strobe light mode on the Peacekeeper Mini. In fact, we have what we call a passive “panic” mode. The light assumes that when you push the “On” button, you are under attack and immediately goes to a bright strobe for 3 seconds and then to constant high mode. If you do not want it to go to the panic mode, you “tap” the button twice and it goes directly to high mode. It also has a low mode and an SOS mode. Everything is designed to increase safety.<br/></p>

The Peacekeeper Mini (light/spray portion 4 inches long, with cover 4.95 inches long) is a non-lethal self-defense device that combines the utility of a flashlight with the stopping power of a concentrated, military strength pepper spray, more than double the strength of the spray used by the US marines. It's effectiveness is significantly enhanced by a stealth delivery method. It also will have the added safety of the new Bluetooth ""crowd alert"" technology, recently added as a FREE upgrade for campaign funders. Estimated retail Price $79.95.What is Bluetooth/GPS ""Crowd Alert"" technology?It is a Bluetooth chip in the Peacekeeper that, upon activation, sends a signal via bluetooth through the person's phone to other phones who have elected to receive the alerts.  This app will be given free to all campaign participants if we reach our stretch goal of $150,000. We are working together with a brilliant app development team to create a very sophisticated app that goes far beyond the basic functionality. It employs many underlying multi-tiered failsafe measures to ensure maximum efficiency and dependability. Unlike other blue tooth ""alert"" products, the Peacekeeper Mini has the added ability to STOP THE ATTACKER!

                         




Over the past several years, we have created some of the world’s best non-lethal devices,
namely the TigerLight® Gold Series I, II, III, and the T100. We have one simple goal at TigerLight:
to keep you safe from those who want to cause you harm. It was with this goal in mind that we
created a product that safely stops bad situations from getting worse. Meet the Peacekeeper
Mini. 












""The light is amazing, but the stopping power is simply unbelievable!""                                                            Officer Mike Stradley, SWAT


See many more testimonials from non-paid celebrities, top ranking police and military personnel and expert self-defense instructors below and in the gallery (Tab above).






There are countless self-defense products available to civilians these days. Unfortunately, most of those self-defense products have limitations. See how we compare.

Stun guns and tasers often times require the user to be close to their intended target.
In addition to proximity issues, heavy clothing, poor aim, and multiple attackers contribute to these device’s limitations. Since attacks are not always broadcasted, the stun guns
short incapacitation time allows little time to get to safety, especially in isolated areas. 





Pepper sprays are all too often unreliable. Recently, the University of Utah conducted a test of various sprays. Their study showed that the potency claims made by the
manufacturers are often times misstated with some sprays being 1/100th of the potency claimed on their label. In addition to the low potency, it is uncommon for people to
carry pepper spray in their hands which makes it less accessible if an attack happens.








Though we support the right to carry firearms, and know that firearms can save
lives, firearms are impractical in a majority of situations where civilian-on-civilian attacks occur. Ending someone’s life is the last thing that you want to do, which is why
we created the Peacekeeper Mini. It allows you to stop an attack before it starts.

""If you are looking for the best personal protection device, this is it, at ANY price!""Director Lance Powers, SWAT TEAM LEADER, SRT Instructor, Master Trainer














The Peacekeeper Mini offers peace of mind to an unsafe world. Here are 7 REASONS the Peacemaker Mini is the #1 choice to keep you out of harm’s way: 





You are more likely to have a Peacekeeper Mini in-hand compared to other self-defense
products because of its dual purposes (flashlight+pepper spray).



The Peacekeeper Mini spray delivery method, based on previous TigerLights, have shown documented stop rates of 96% because of its concentrated powerful formula, the spray pattern and most of all, the element of surprise. This results in a far greater and more immediate effect on the respiratory system resulting in a more potent incapacitating effect, particularly on drug impaired individuals. 
The Peacekeeper Mini mimics and assimilates your natural response to an act of aggression, which is key in a high stress situation.
The Peacekeeper Mini can be used on multiple attackers as opposed to other self-defense products.
The Peacekeeper Mini’s effect lasts 30-45 minutes, giving you enough time to get away.
With the hand strap, a person is less likely to be one of the 90% who drop their weapon or self-defense device during a physical attack.
The Peacekeeper Mini is inexpensive.


""Our approach has always been to produce products that work in practice, not only in theory.  That is why TigerLights not only have the highest documented ""stop rate"" of any non-lethal device, but create such passion from users that, in one case, a police officer drove over 1,000 miles only to get a new $12.00 light bulb for his TigerLight® so he would not have to go to work as a police officer that night without it.""  Michael H. Teig




Violent crimes are becoming more and more prevalent throughout the United States.
To help illustrate our point, here are a few facts. 








More than 22 million women in the United States have been raped in their lifetime.












18.3% of women in the United States have survived a completed or attempted rape.













Every two minutes, somewhere in America, someone is sexually assaulted.













15% of sexual assault and rape victims are under age 12; 29% are age 12-17; 44%
are under age 18; 80% are under age 30; ages 12-34 are the highest risk years.













Girls ages 16-19 are 4 times more likely than the general population to be victims of
rape, attempted rape, or sexual assault. 














""90% of people drop their weapon when physically attacked.""





Below is a computer generated 3D image of the hand strap, in a variety of colors, that will come with your Peacekeeper Mini.  It will be a soft, pliable material that will stretch over your hand and secure the light to your hand comfortably allowing you to actually use your fingers while the light is in hand.

Unfortunately, attackers do not broadcast or announce their intent to attack.  The victim often does not realize he or she is being attacked until physical contact has been made. Given that 90% of people will drop their weapon in a sudden, physical attack, the hand strap becomes critically important.

We started the Peacekeeper Mini Project in early 2013 and have moved steadily forward ever since.
We know the self-defense industry and after thorough research, we know that this product is
what’s missing. Through hard work, we are ready to bring the newest TigerLight® product to
the public with a new and improved design.

Speaking of designs, they are done. As you can see, we have completed that part of the process and we are ready to move forward to the manufacturing stages. This is where we need
your support. We have proven ourselves as a mainstay in the industry and we are ready to
introduce the Peacekeeper Mini to you. 



We started the Peacekeeper Mini Project in early 2013 and have moved steadily forward ever since. Through hard work, we are ready to bring the newest TigerLight® product to the public with a new and improved design.

Speaking of design, “We went after the best and got them.” said TigerLight CEO Michael Teig.  I wanted a team of not only extremely talented designers and engineers, but also ones who understand the technology, the market and exactly what we are trying to accomplish.  We knew it had to be high performance and visually appealing or it would not be in hand when needed. And, it has to remain in hand during an attack. 
When it comes to high performance and beauty, Ferrari comes to mind and David Wiener has designed many incredibly beautiful, high performance products for Ferrari and is, himself, an avid sportsman, even designing a world-record-breaking bicycle ridden by Olympian Eric Heiden.
Everything has been taken into account from the positioning of the light switch and spray, the contour, width and length of the light and the materials, while accommodating people’s natural mental and physical response to an attack.

“We looked at a hundred designs before bringing David on board and David’s design garnered, by far, the most passionate, positive response from a variety of potential customers.  With one finish, it can take on the appearance of a piece of jewelry or a diamond. With another finish, it can look military tough...and it will be tough!” says Teig.  “There are more advantages to the size, weight and design than I have room to explain, but people will experience it, especially when they really need it!”
David has worked with a team of extremely talented engineers including electrical engineer Lonnie Adams, industrial designer John Gardiner and systems engineer Rod Sheffield. Mechanical designer, Chris Knapp and industrial designer Quinn Besinger also made significant contributions in the early stages of development.    
We are ready to move forward to the manufacturing stages. This is where we need your support. We have proven ourselves as a mainstay in the industry and we are ready to introduce the Peacekeeper Mini to you.










We developed this product because we want everyone to feel safe, regardless of their situation.
With your help, we can save lives and bring increased safety and peace of mind to millions. Your
support will allow us to create not only a high quality and proven self-defense product, but one
that’s affordable for everyone. You can protect your loved ones by giving them the Peacekeeper
Mini. 
Help us make a difference.

We have been supplying military-grade products to policemen for the past 13 years, but our
goal is to get the same quality of product into your home for a fraction of the price.

In order for us to do this, we have to order the components and machinery needed to begin
manufacturing in bulk so we can drive the cost per Peacekeeper Mini down. The bottom line is this:
if we can manufacture for less, we can sell it for less.  The more successful the campaign, the lower the retail price.  Help us make it possible for everyone to afford one.
We ask you to think of those you love and fund a cause that has the potential to save the lives
of millions.

A January 24, 2014 New York Times article states: “Mr. Obama gave his task force 90 days to recommend best practices for colleges to prevent or respond to assaults.”


A subsequent report from The White House Council On Women and Girls titled Rape and Sexual Assault: A Renewed Call To Action dated January 14, 2014 detailed, among others, the following solution:




Launched the 1 is 2 Many Campaign to focus on teen and young-adult sexual violence. Among a number of other initiatives, the Campaign inspired the creation of the “Circle of 6” app- which puts a group of friends instantly in touch with each other, so someone in trouble can send a “come and get me” message, complete with GPS location map.


TigerLight has responded and surpassed this initiative with a tiny, pocket-size device that is like having multiple personal bodyguards with backup teams on call. 

Why do we need it?  One reason is that 1 out every 5 girls on college campuses are raped and its getting worse, not better.  


Imagine a young coed walking to her car from the library, a small flashlight in hand. She is confronted by a rapist. In a blink of an eye two things happen; a “crowd alert” with her photo and GPS location appears on the screens of 200 other student's cell phones in the vicinity, including the campus security, and they all run immediately to her rescue only to find the would-be rapist writhing on the ground, incapacitated, but not injured.  This is the Peacekeeper Mini, a proprietary, patented self-defense device, affordable to students and based on street proven technology, tried and proven by our military and police.


Help us make sure that White House is aware that the solution can be found in the Peacekeeper Mini project on Indiegogo.
O.U.R. Rescue

Self Defense For Everyone:  Every teacher and administrator in our schools, every student 18 or older, every jogger, hiker, walker and everyone else old enough to use one. Think about what this could mean!
Our NEW partnership with Operation Underground Railroad (O.U.R.) is to help spread the word about this amazing new product. Although this campaign's purpose is to fund the production of the Peacekeeper Mini and reward YOU for helping do that, TigerLight has participated in many charitable causes and we do not know of any cause more important than O.U.R., so we are working together to promote the Peacekeeper Mini campaign while also donating 20% to rescue children, right now. If you do not want part of your contribution to support O.U.R. you can select a PERK that does not include O.U.R.


Message from Tim Ballard, Founder and CEO of Operation Underground Railroad (O.U.R.) and Jump Team Commander for rescue operations. 
""We are thrilled to partner with Michael Teig, TigerLight, and those of you who will help us rescue these children from unfathomable misery. When you contribute to the new Peacekeeper Mini campaign, TigerLight will donate 20% of that contribution to Operation Underground Railroad (O.U.R) and 100% will go to fund the direct costs of the rescue missions.' 
'Each mission costs between $15,000 - $25,000. You cannot begin to comprehend the difference you will make in these kids' lives.  There are approximately 2,000,000 of these children being subjected to the worst possible kind of slavery.  I have shed many tears. If you saw what I have seen, you would probably give everything you have to free just one of these children!""










                  
What happens if the campaign does not reach the minimum campaign goal?
ANSWER: The money is all returned to the contributors.
Will the spray still work if the battery goes dead?
ANSWER: Yes.


Is the money deducted out of our account the moment we pay?
ANSWER: Yes, is it held by Indiegogo until the end of the campaign and then disbursed to TigerLight if the campaign reaches a minimum of $50,000 and returned to the donors if it does not.  That is supposed to take place within 15 days after the end of the campaign.


How is the light turned on?  I do not see the light button on the side like the other TigerLights.
ANSWER: The light and the spray are both operated with the thumb.  It is a new patent pending design.  Both approaches work extremely well but we are excited about this design.  We had been getting lots of requests from the professional industry, here in the US and in Europe, to have the switch under the thumb like many of the new, small tactical lights.  


The problem was that it would not work unless the light and components were very small.  In the Peacekeeper Mini, it works PERFECTLY.  If you have your thumb on the light button, the spray button is behind and above, so you will not accidentally push the spray button.  You have to raise your thumb up a little and push it back slightly to get over the spray button to push it down.  The really cool part is that you can also rest the thumb over the spray button, resting on an interior side ledge.  This is the position one would want to be in if exposed to potential attack.  In this position the thumb is slightly cocked at an angle with the thumb knuckle right over the light button.  Without moving your thumb position, all you have to do is ""un-cock"" or straighten your thumb and operate the light with the underside of your thumb knuckle.  It is very intuitive.  We have tried it with rapid prototypes and men and woman with small and large hands can operate it very comfortably and easily.


Will the Peacekeeper Mini have a holster?
ANSWER: We plan to make carry options for every situation, for the arm, wrist, waist, ankle, purse, bike.  We emphasize the great importance that the Peacekeeper Mini be in your hand when things go bad, and retention is also very important.  However, we realize it is not going to be in your hand in every situation and every environment, so we want to make it convenient, comfortable and quickly accessible at all times, whether at the beach or the prom, work or play.  Our goal is that it is with you whenever your cell phone is and we know that is nearly 24/7. 


What if I do not have a PayPal account.  Can I still purchase (donate)?
ANSWER: You can contribute to our campaign via PayPal, even if you do not have a PayPal account. Use your credit card to ""Pay as a Guest"" without signing in to PayPal with a password: 


When you get to the PayPal screen, you'll see up top ""Choose a Way to Pay""
Select the second option: ""Pay with a debit or credit card""
Complete the form - PayPal accepts Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and American Express
Deselect the checkbox that says: ""Save this information with a PayPal account""
Click ""Review and Continue"" to continue with a payment using a credit card

Note: Residents of Utah may be subject to sales tax.
Is there a temperature range the product works most effectively in?
ANSWER: Every canister manufacturer recommends that it not be stored above 120 degreed F.  Our canister in our other lights were tested for the military by Eastern Laboratories in ten degree increments for an hour and only one canister failed after 55 minutes at 212 degrees fahrenheit. I have sprayed canisters after leaving them out in the snow all night in temperatures of about 5 degrees fahrenheit.  They sprayed fine.  Although a minimum temperature is not mentioned, some say it can be as low as -5 degrees F.  I suspect that our sprays from Sabre Red and Guardian PD, given that they are not water based and are non-flammable, and are both used by the military and police, may have very low freezing points.  Also, given the fact that the canister is contained in the flashlight and not exposed to direct sunlight, it is likely to withstand both higher and lower temperatures.
Does the Peacekeeper Mini have a strobe mode?
I received a private comment suggesting that we have a strobe light mode on the Peacekeeper Mini. In fact, we have what we call a passive “panic” mode. The light assumes that when you push the “On” button, you are under attack and immediately goes to a bright strobe for 3 seconds and then to constant high mode. If you do not want it to go to the panic mode, you “tap” the button twice and it goes directly to high mode. It also has a low mode and an SOS mode. Everything is designed to increase safety.
