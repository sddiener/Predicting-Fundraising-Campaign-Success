<p>Let's break it down for you.</p>
<p><b>The Rights: </b>The rights to a Pulitzer winning play for Los Angeles with four performances in a 0-49 seat theatre?  A hundred a night.  That's 400.  Thanks David Auburn.  We appreciate you letting us attempt to bring your words to life.  </p>

<p>And so, that's why we're humbly asking you for $4,000 to bring this production to life.</p>

It’s worrying that something someone said will get stuck, that a random thought that pops into your brain is true, and the inability to let a thought/idea go. </p><p> </p><p>When I was younger my OCD manifested physically, I was unable to have anyone in a space I considered my own or touching something of mine without it feeling contaminated.  I would have to do things an even number of times, which resulted in my whole family crashing their bikes on a vacation because I took one hand off the handle, the other hand off, and then needed to take both hands off.  I was leading the bike trip so when I crashed into a mailbox and fell, so did my sister and my parents.  I was unable to lend anyone anything, my sister would want to read one of my comic books and I wouldn’t be able to let her take it without feeling like it wasn’t mine anymore or contaminated.  This resulted in a lot of confusion for my parents as they worked hard to raise kids that were good at sharing and not selfish; I as a person learned those values, my OCD did not. </p><p>That’s the problem with my OCD in general: it doesn’t match my personality.  I am someone who wants to give everyone anything I can in order to make them happy or better, I automatically offer up my belongings when someone else is in need completely forgetting about my disorder and then shamefully have to retract the invitation or suffer through an OCD episode.  As an extreme empath and severely sensitive person, when someone is in pain, I feel it with them and want to fix it. </p><p> </p><p>When I was younger my disorder was easier to explain. My OCD was more visible, it was something you could see.  My family tried to keep up with me; they learned which spoons they couldn’t use, what chair they couldn’t sit in, and not to put their bare feet on the couch or on me. </p><p>As I’ve gotten older, it’s easier to hide as most of it rests in my head.  Unless I told you, you would not know how hard I am working and fighting against the lack of serotonin in my brain. </p><p>Just this morning I was in rehearsal with two friends of mine, who I logically know care about me a great deal, and out of nowhere my brain said:  “No one would notice if you weren’t around, everyone hates you.”  Now you might be thinking “oh no no I’ve had intrusive thoughts or worries like this, I totally get what you mean, I’ve definitely been there.”  And truthfully, you might’ve.  There are a lot of undiagnosed people in this world.  But I’m sitting there looking at my two friends, acting in a scene and this thought pops into my head.  At first I think, that sucks that you’ve decided to show up now OCD but these people care about me, that’s silly.  Then the thought circles through another 50 times, I continuously tell my OCD that it’s wrong and it needs to shut up but it becomes hard to hear anything anyone is saying or be present in the room. </p><p>I look at my scene partner and tears fill my eyes: they would not even notice or care if I wasn’t around.  I don’t matter to them.  I don’t matter to them.  I don’t matter to anyone.  I don’t matter.  I don’t matter.  I don’t matter.  I don’t matter.  The thought envelopes my mind and suddenly I believe whole-heartedly that what my head is saying is true.  Now this is my almost 25 year old self, so I know how to handle such circumstances, it happens 4-5 times, at least, on a good day. </p><p> </p><p>The way I generally know if someone has it or not is by the way that they say it.  If they have it, there is a sparkle, a tiny glint of recognition that the person across from them has experienced the same level of torture.  There’s generally a: Have you ever had such and such happen?  And even if your “things” aren’t the same, the constant terror and sick-to-your-stomach feeling is the same.  When someone thinks they have OCD generally they say things like:  “Sometimes I need things to be clean, I have been worried a lot lately, I like things to be very specific and I’m pretty type A.”  They admit things that are surface level and normal, sure they could land in generalized anxiety world but they are not OCD. </p><p>Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is not just obsessive or just compulsive: it’s both.  The only way out of it is through.  Your OCD will tell you that the only way to get rid of a thought is to act out the corresponding compulsion but the only way to actually take the power away from the thought is to do nothing or do the opposite.  For example, I will think if I don’t get up and double check that my door is locked someone will come in here and kill me.  If I get up and check the lock, I firstly feel an excessive amount of shame and then it sends a signal to my brain that the OCD was right and this thought will come up many more times.  If I sit with the thought, even though it feels like I will die, it proves to my brain that there is some flaw in the OCD thinking and maybe it’s okay not to listen. </p><p> </p><p>What I’ll ask when someone confides in me and tells me they think they have OCD is if they don’t do the thing they claim makes them have OCD do they feel like they’re going to die?  Not like kind of uncomfortable, like every bit of your body is screaming and in full fledged fight or flight mode?  No? Not OCD. </p><p> </p><p>OCD will make you so angry you can’t see straight, you’ll feel like you’re standing over your body watching someone else ,who definitely isn’t you, scream at someone you love and say terrible, terrible things because that body is so overwhelmed with emotions that screaming is the only way to get it out. </p><p>The nice thing about OCD is that it tires, the more you exhaust yourself, the closer you are to being free.  It’s not the healthiest of strategies but tiny Allison sure was a big fan of the use all your energy in the biggest scariest way and then you’ll be free of this feeling a whole lot faster because you’ll be too tired to care anymore.  Can you imagine being terrified you’re going to die if you don’t check the door an even number of times or until it feels safe and only feeling better when you’re so exhausted you don’t care if you die?  That’s my OCD and what I hope Living with Olivia Cadence Donovan will help open up for audience members.  </p></div>","Synopsis: Emily has been living with Olivia her whole life.  Olivia is her best friend and roommate, her protector and her downfall.  She can be extraordinarily difficult and time consuming but she is always there.  Olivia is Emily's Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.  Living with Olivia Cadence Donovan is a play about not just surviving but living with OCD.  Tickets now on sale!: https://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/3414967Website:https://livingwitholiviacadencedonovan.comWhat We Need & What You Get:After the successful run of the show @ the Hudson Guild Theatre in NYC, it is time for the Canadian premiere and we are looking to the artistic community to help us get there!

<h3>The Play<br/>
</h3>
<p>HOPE IN CHAOS is the extraordinary true story of one average New Yorker who found herself as a relief worker amongst the chaos of Ground Zero in the days immediately following September 11th. She would remain there working amongst the rubble with an unlikely team of civilian relief workers for four months. HOPE IN CHAOS explores the struggles – both political and emotional, and triumphs of a group of young New Yorkers who answered a call and found their strength in a city that had been shaken to its core. Directed by Broadway's Holly-Anne Ruggiero, it will be performed in a special limited engagement run at the Richmond Shepard Theater to coincide with the 10-year Memorial of September 11th.<br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Message<br/>
</h3>
<span class=""agText""><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Hope in Chaos</span> is about action. It's about how each of us holds the potential for greatness through our choices, and - perhaps most importantly - it's about how many small acts of kindness add up to something both enormous and extraordinary.  From it's very beginnings this play was a journey that depended not just on a playwright, but on a team of peers, mentors, actors...dozens of people.  People who helped and worked and supported the project - for free - because it was something they believed in.  That journey so far has reinforced that message of the play - that little things add up.  That greatness is many people, but it can start with one - you.<br/></span>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Goal</h3>It's simple, really.  This truly is an extraordinary story with an amazing message, and we want this 10-year Memorial premiere production to reach as many people as possible. To do that, we need your help.  <br/>
</div>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hello folks! I am 27 years old and have been dancing for many years, it is one of my passions in life.</p>
<p>In the past i have always been part of the classical dance world e.g... The Royal Ballet School where i studied for 8 years and San Francisco Ballet where i danced for 7 years. </p>
<p>Recently i have been moving away from this classical background and finding inspiration in different forms of movement and art.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This year i am all about learning and growth. In order to move forward on a new path creatively i feel it is necessary for me to be in situations unknown.</p>
<p>When i saw the Batsheva dance company perform 4 years ago on tour in sf my jaw hit the ground!<br/></p>
<p>Over december time Batsheva Dance Company offer a 9 day course in Tel Aviv for 75 dancers 18yrs+ to go and workshop with the Director Ohad Naharin and his dancers. </p>
<p>Opportunities like this do not come around so easily and it is a dream realized for me to be part of this environment.</p>
<p>Even though this happens between december 25th and january 2nd (holiday time) I feel this is a very important step for me and will inevitably help me grow as an artist.....i just want to learn and create damn it!</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This workshop is something i have to go through, its that simple. </p>
<p>I would love to translate this gaga language into my body, my mind and create on this level.</p>
<p>so in the future when working on new material and new work i will have a whole different side to movement by way of expressing myself. </p>
<p>To share art and life is what makes the world go round! </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>After looking at the sum for the workshop and flights and accommodation i realize that in total it will cost $2000 dollars or more.</p>
<p>I am asking for help here guys, i would love to raise $1100 so instead of being a complete starving artist i am just an average poor artist instead.</p>
<p>I realize that in this world money can rule us but this is just one opportunity i cannot let pass me by. </p>

</div></div>","Our Story
Hello folks! I am 27 years old and have been dancing for many years, it is one of my passions in life.
In the past i have always been part of the classical dance world e.g... The Royal Ballet School where i studied for 8 years and San Francisco Ballet where i danced for 7 years. 
Recently i have been moving away from this classical background and finding inspiration in different forms of movement and art.

This year i am all about learning and growth. In order to move forward on a new path creatively i feel it is necessary for me to be in situations unknown.
When i saw the Batsheva dance company perform 4 years ago on tour in sf my jaw hit the ground!
Over december time Batsheva Dance Company offer a 9 day course in Tel Aviv for 75 dancers 18yrs+ to go and workshop with the Director Ohad Naharin and his dancers. 
Opportunities like this do not come around so easily and it is a dream realized for me to be part of this environment.
Even though this happens between december 25th and january 2nd (holiday time) I feel this is a very important step for me and will inevitably help me grow as an artist.....i just want to learn and create damn it!


The Impact
This workshop is something i have to go through, its that simple. 
I would love to translate this gaga language into my body, my mind and create on this level.
so in the future when working on new material and new work i will have a whole different side to movement by way of expressing myself. 
To share art and life is what makes the world go round! 


What We Need & What You Get
After looking at the sum for the workshop and flights and accommodation i realize that in total it will cost $2000 dollars or more.
I am asking for help here guys, i would love to raise $1100 so instead of being a complete starving artist i am just an average poor artist instead.
I realize that in this world money can rule us but this is just one opportunity i cannot let pass me by.

<p><b>HeadFirst Productions</b> is asking for your support in the
form of financial sponsorship. We are a new theatre company with a <b>compelling creative and social vision and
the people to make it happen</b>. We need your help to fund our inaugural production
of Puccini’s masterpiece, <b><i>La Bohème</i></b>, and to establish our
ambitious Education &amp; Outreach Programme.</p>
<p>This production
of <i>La Bohème</i> has been in development
since October 2012. Over the past year and a half we have planned, re-evaluated
and fine-tuned every aspect of our proposal. Being awarded a grant from the <b>Arts Council England</b> reinforces the
value of this project and has reaffirmed our determination for it to be the
best it can be. Rehearsals start at the beginning of August, with workshops
running throughout the rest of the year. In order to pay our artists’ fees and
hire or buy services to make this production happen, we need to raise the
remainder of our budget. This is where <b>your
support</b> could help substantially. <br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
</p><p><i><br/></i></p>
<p><b><u>
</u></b><u></u></p><b><u></u></b><p></p><p><b><u>What is HeadFirst Productions?</u></b></p>
<p>HeadFirst
Productions is a UK-based, touring theatre company that tells <b>relevant stories</b>, and is committed to
developing an <b>Education &amp; Outreach
Programme</b>. Our work will consist of both <b>opera and theatre</b>. We are supported by leading theatre and opera
director, <b>Jonathan Kent</b>, who has
agreed to act as patron to the company.</p>
<p>At HeadFirst
Productions we dig deep into classic works of drama to find <b>new perspectives and insights</b> into
characters, their situations, and the choices they make. We make theatre for a
modern-day audience, by which we simply mean the people who are watching <i>now</i>. Theatre is ultimately made to be
seen, be it by an audience of one or by one hundred thousand. All thesocial and
cultural ‘noise’ of every day life is integral to how we understand and receive
art as well as how we make it. This does not mean that we will update
everything to a contemporary setting, rather that we intend to acknowledge <b>shifting perceptions and paradigms</b>
whilst we develop our work. </p><p><br/></p><p><b><u>What people have said about us:</u></b></p><p>
</p><ul><li>“I thought your opera evening was
wonderful, a real feast and totally inspiring; really brilliant idea.”</li></ul><ul><li>“We
thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and thought the entertainment was of the highest quality.”</li></ul><ul><li>“Amazing!
I laughed, I cried. Can't wait until La Bohème!”</li></ul><ul><li>“What
a great evening, and such amazing talent.”</li></ul><ul><li>“Completely
awesome event. The young (Sevenoaks School) singers in Act One were great. How
wonderful to watch a seamless, pacy show without any of the agonising, clunky
gaps between individual performances that seem to be the feature of school
events. Every performer engaged the audience, and found meaning and heart in
every song / aria. Real performances! Note to school: your students can do it
if you create the conditions! Act Two was awesome - fabulous voices delivering
an hour of opera magic with pace, charm, and emotion. No props, no scenery, no
costumes - just blistering talent.”</li></ul><p>
<br/></p><p><b><i><u>La Bohème</u></i></b><b><u>: Our version</u></b></p>
<p><b>HeadFirst Production's inaugural touring production will be
Puccini’s <i>La Bohème</i>.</b>
Sung in Italian and updated to a contemporary setting, this classic tale will
be re-imagined in the 21st century.
</p><p>Set in a degrading, urban environment where Mimi’s
illness is not tuberculosis but Heroin addiction, and her friends are ‘recreational’
drug users, this will be a gritty, harsh retelling of one of the <b>greatest tragic love stories</b>. We aim to make <i>La Bohème</i> easily accessible to opera
newcomers and challenge those who know it to experience it afresh. The futility
and horror of Mimi’s drug-induced death will make Puccini’s soaring score all the
more heart-rending.</p>
<p>Mid-scale opera
with an updated English libretto is extremely popular in and around London. However, there
is a scarcity of productions sung in the original language. We aim to fill this
gap. We will use the <b>inherent musicality
of the Italian language</b> in <i>La Bohème</i>
to enhance the audience’s emotional engagement, and hook their involvement by
making the story vividly relevant; tuberculosis is rare in the modern world,
but recreational drug use and dependency on addictive substances is widespread
and devastating.
</p><p><b><u><br/></u></b></p><p><b><u>Touring our work</u></b></p>
<p>HeadFirst
Productions will produce a <b>mid-scale
touring production</b> of <i>La Bohème</i>.
There will be a minimum of four performances in two venues in the Southeast of
England, extending the tour further if possible. So far we have established relationships with <b>The</b> <b>LOST Theatre</b> in
Wandsworth and <b>Trinity Theatre</b> in
Tunbridge Wells, and are in the process of devising a series of educational
workshops with the local communities.</p>
<p><b><u><br/></u></b></p><p><b><u>Why
our Bohème is needed: Outreach work</u></b></p>
<p>Due
to the nature of the subject matter of this interpretation, we will be working
closely with leading drug and alcohol rehabilitation charity, <b>Addaction</b> (<a href=""http://www.addaction.org.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.addaction.org.uk</a>), to run workshops and
develop awareness around substance abuse. These workshops will enable the
charity’s service users to take part in discussions and practical workshops
exploring opera, lead by a professional animateur. </p>
<p>We
are also currently establishing a relationship with the <b>educational music hub, SoundHub</b>, based in Kent, to run a summer
holiday workshop programme that will allow students to develop their skills,
write music with the help of a composer, and to perform on a professional
theatre stage to an invited audience. We hope to be able to provide
participants of all of our outreach workshops with heavily discounted – or
ideally free – tickets to our shows to allow them to have a full, rounded
experience of opera, but this will depend on securing additional funding to
cover deficit from the box office return.</p><p><b><u><br/></u></b></p><p><b><u>Where the money
goes</u></b></p>
<p>The grant from
the <b>Arts Council England</b> will cover
just over half of the artistic fees but further sponsorship will cover the
costs of hiring the venues, marketing our project, developing our outreach
programme, and realising the design. </p>
<p>We have set a
target of £2000 on Indiegogo. This money will go directly towards the costs of
the costume and set. If we raise more than our target, the extra money will
cover fees for the few artists who have offered to work for free until we raise
enough money to pay them, on the understanding that this might not happen at
all. If we do not raise our full target, everything we do raise will still go
towards set and costumes. The Institute of Human Development has agreed to
underwrite any loss, so your money will never be in jeopardy.</p>
<p>With your assistance
we will produce a <b>fully staged and
costumed production</b> of Puccini’s <i>La
Bohème</i>, as well as <b>widening access
to the arts for children and adults</b> in low-engagement communities.</p>
<p>Please have a
look at the right to see what we can offer in return for your help.</p>
<p>In addition to
the rewards listed, your donation will:</p>
<p><span>·<span>

our work</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Be the start of a new relationship with a young
company</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Be a valuable way to help to start to engage new
audiences</p><p><br/></p><p><b><b><u>Risks and Challenges</u></b></b></p><p>Of course there are always risks when mounting a production at any scale but we are confident that HeadFirst Productions has the skills and experience to overcome any challenges we may face. In the year and half of planning this production we have dealt with various issues and adapted to changing circumstances. This may be our first full scale production but the company comprises individuals with extensive experience of making large and small scale work. We are confident that we have the means to preempt the majority of challenges that will come our way and the flexibility to solve any problems that may arise that we have not already forseen. <br/></p>
<p><b><u><br/></u></b></p><p><b><u>Long term ambition
</u></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Over the next
few years we intend to develop a <b>diverse
programme of work</b> from opera to theatre and occasionally combinations of
the two. Sometimes we will perform in <b>theatres</b>,
sometimes in <b>found spaces</b>. Sometimes
the audience will be seated; sometimes they will have to move around. We hope
to build a reputation as a theatre company that engages and moves our
audiences, <b>producing excellence by
questioning the status quo</b>. In the long term we aspire to be regularly
programmed for national tours by the country’s leading regional theatres and
arts centres.</p>

<p>We know that
many of you are not in a position to make a financial contribution, but you can
still help. Do please <b>spread the word</b>

(www.addaction.org.uk) TO HELP COMBAT DRUG AND ALCOHOL MISUSE AND 
DEPENDENCY*Why we need you
HeadFirst Productions is asking for your support in the
form of financial sponsorship. We are a new theatre company with a compelling creative and social vision and
the people to make it happen. We need your help to fund our inaugural production
of Puccini’s masterpiece, La Bohème, and to establish our
ambitious Education & Outreach Programme.
This production
of La Bohème has been in development
since October 2012. Over the past year and a half we have planned, re-evaluated
and fine-tuned every aspect of our proposal. Being awarded a grant from the Arts Council England reinforces the
value of this project and has reaffirmed our determination for it to be the
best it can be. Rehearsals start at the beginning of August, with workshops
running throughout the rest of the year. In order to pay our artists’ fees and
hire or buy services to make this production happen, we need to raise the
remainder of our budget. This is where your
support could help substantially. 



What is HeadFirst Productions?
HeadFirst
Productions is a UK-based, touring theatre company that tells relevant stories, and is committed to
developing an Education & Outreach
Programme. Our work will consist of both opera and theatre. We are supported by leading theatre and opera
director, Jonathan Kent, who has
agreed to act as patron to the company.
At HeadFirst
Productions we dig deep into classic works of drama to find new perspectives and insights into
characters, their situations, and the choices they make. We make theatre for a
modern-day audience, by which we simply mean the people who are watching now. Theatre is ultimately made to be
seen, be it by an audience of one or by one hundred thousand. All thesocial and
cultural ‘noise’ of every day life is integral to how we understand and receive
art as well as how we make it. This does not mean that we will update
everything to a contemporary setting, rather that we intend to acknowledge shifting perceptions and paradigms
whilst we develop our work. What people have said about us:
“I thought your opera evening was
wonderful, a real feast and totally inspiring; really brilliant idea.”“We
thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and thought the entertainment was of the highest quality.”“Amazing!
I laughed, I cried. Can't wait until La Bohème!”“What
a great evening, and such amazing talent.”“Completely
awesome event. The young (Sevenoaks School) singers in Act One were great. How
wonderful to watch a seamless, pacy show without any of the agonising, clunky
gaps between individual performances that seem to be the feature of school
events. Every performer engaged the audience, and found meaning and heart in
every song / aria. Real performances! Note to school: your students can do it
if you create the conditions! Act Two was awesome - fabulous voices delivering
an hour of opera magic with pace, charm, and emotion. No props, no scenery, no
costumes - just blistering talent.”
La Bohème: Our version
HeadFirst Production's inaugural touring production will be
Puccini’s La Bohème.
Sung in Italian and updated to a contemporary setting, this classic tale will
be re-imagined in the 21st century.
Set in a degrading, urban environment where Mimi’s
illness is not tuberculosis but Heroin addiction, and her friends are ‘recreational’
drug users, this will be a gritty, harsh retelling of one of the greatest tragic love stories. We aim to make La Bohème easily accessible to opera
newcomers and challenge those who know it to experience it afresh. The futility
and horror of Mimi’s drug-induced death will make Puccini’s soaring score all the
more heart-rending.
Mid-scale opera
with an updated English libretto is extremely popular in and around London. However, there
is a scarcity of productions sung in the original language. We aim to fill this
gap. We will use the inherent musicality
of the Italian language in La Bohème
to enhance the audience’s emotional engagement, and hook their involvement by
making the story vividly relevant; tuberculosis is rare in the modern world,
but recreational drug use and dependency on addictive substances is widespread
and devastating.
Touring our work
HeadFirst
Productions will produce a mid-scale
touring production of La Bohème.
There will be a minimum of four performances in two venues in the Southeast of
England, extending the tour further if possible. So far we have established relationships with The LOST Theatre in
Wandsworth and Trinity Theatre in
Tunbridge Wells, and are in the process of devising a series of educational
workshops with the local communities.
Why
our Bohème is needed: Outreach work
Due
to the nature of the subject matter of this interpretation, we will be working
closely with leading drug and alcohol rehabilitation charity, Addaction (www.addaction.org.uk), to run workshops and
develop awareness around substance abuse. These workshops will enable the
charity’s service users to take part in discussions and practical workshops
exploring opera, lead by a professional animateur. 
We
are also currently establishing a relationship with the educational music hub, SoundHub, based in Kent, to run a summer
holiday workshop programme that will allow students to develop their skills,
write music with the help of a composer, and to perform on a professional
theatre stage to an invited audience. We hope to be able to provide
participants of all of our outreach workshops with heavily discounted – or
ideally free – tickets to our shows to allow them to have a full, rounded
experience of opera, but this will depend on securing additional funding to
cover deficit from the box office return.Where the money
goes
The grant from
the Arts Council England will cover
just over half of the artistic fees but further sponsorship will cover the
costs of hiring the venues, marketing our project, developing our outreach
programme, and realising the design. 
We have set a
target of £2000 on Indiegogo. This money will go directly towards the costs of
the costume and set. If we raise more than our target, the extra money will
cover fees for the few artists who have offered to work for free until we raise
enough money to pay them, on the understanding that this might not happen at
all. If we do not raise our full target, everything we do raise will still go
towards set and costumes. The Institute of Human Development has agreed to
underwrite any loss, so your money will never be in jeopardy.
With your assistance
we will produce a fully staged and
costumed production of Puccini’s La
Bohème, as well as widening access
to the arts for children and adults in low-engagement communities.
Please have a
look at the right to see what we can offer in return for your help.
In addition to
the rewards listed, your donation will:
· 
Have an immediate, significant and tangible effect on
our work
· 
Be the start of a new relationship with a young
company
· 
Be a valuable way to help to start to engage new
audiencesRisks and ChallengesOf course there are always risks when mounting a production at any scale but we are confident that HeadFirst Productions has the skills and experience to overcome any challenges we may face. In the year and half of planning this production we have dealt with various issues and adapted to changing circumstances. This may be our first full scale production but the company comprises individuals with extensive experience of making large and small scale work. We are confident that we have the means to preempt the majority of challenges that will come our way and the flexibility to solve any problems that may arise that we have not already forseen. 
Long term ambition


Over the next
few years we intend to develop a diverse
programme of work from opera to theatre and occasionally combinations of
the two. Sometimes we will perform in theatres,
sometimes in found spaces. Sometimes
the audience will be seated; sometimes they will have to move around. We hope
to build a reputation as a theatre company that engages and moves our
audiences, producing excellence by
questioning the status quo. In the long term we aspire to be regularly
programmed for national tours by the country’s leading regional theatres and
arts centres.

<h2><strong>Help us bring this historic play to the historic city of New Orleans this November!<br/></strong></h2>
<h2><strong>About us!<br/></strong></h2>
<p><em>L'illusion Comique</em> is a 1636 play in verse by the French playwright Pierre Corneille. While being popular in French speaking countries, it is rarely performed in English speaking ones. Though other versions exist, and though the play has influenced many other works, Pierre's original is hard to come by this side of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>In this fresh adapted translation, Corneille’s masquerade of buffoonery, betrayal, magic, masks and murder is set in the mysterious bayous of Louisiana. This production captures all the farcical intrigue of the original play, while adding a dash of Cajun spice to create a rollicking evening of theatre.</p>
<p>We were fortunate enough to produce the show once before, at Pace University. But we, we the cast, designers, crew and creative were so passionate about sharing this story and the opportunity to bring this beautiful and exciting theatrical experience to life, that we are now producing the show when and where ever we can! We are currently in the midst of producing the show off-off Broadway October 18<sup>th</sup>-20<sup>th </sup>at Under St. Mark’s in the St. Mark's/Astor Place area of New York City; we have appected to the New Orleans Fringe Festival and will be performing the show as part of their 5th Annual Festival!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
This play is really something unlike anything else. It is funny, provacative, heartwarming, inspiring and above all: entertaining.
<p>In the forward to the 1636 publication of M. Corneille’s manuscript for <em>L’illusion Comique</em>, addressed to the mysterious Madame M F D R, Corneille describes the play as &lt;&lt;un estrange monstre&gt;&gt; translating into English as “a strange monster”.  And that is exactly what the play is. It is at once confined to the French Academy’s criteria for drama: one setting, one day, real time; but it also takes us far from Alcandre’s lair, backwards in time and the illusions we see take place over a period of two years.  It is Baroque in its aesthetic and language, but timeless in its story and themes of love, loss, despair, hope and a theatrical good time.</p>
<p>M. Corneille’s play is full of enough themes and motifs to fill an entire semester of a philosophy class (dealing heavily with Carl Jungian theories of the universal unconcious [centuries before Jung was born!], cognitive disonance, the expectations of parents and of an audience are just a few to name). Ultimately though, the play is about the balance between reality and illusion.

About us!
L'illusion Comique is a 1636 play in verse by the French playwright Pierre Corneille. While being popular in French speaking countries, it is rarely performed in English speaking ones. Though other versions exist, and though the play has influenced many other works, Pierre's original is hard to come by this side of the Atlantic.
In this fresh adapted translation, Corneille’s masquerade of buffoonery, betrayal, magic, masks and murder is set in the mysterious bayous of Louisiana. This production captures all the farcical intrigue of the original play, while adding a dash of Cajun spice to create a rollicking evening of theatre.
We were fortunate enough to produce the show once before, at Pace University. But we, we the cast, designers, crew and creative were so passionate about sharing this story and the opportunity to bring this beautiful and exciting theatrical experience to life, that we are now producing the show when and where ever we can! We are currently in the midst of producing the show off-off Broadway October 18th-20th at Under St. Mark’s in the St. Mark's/Astor Place area of New York City; we have appected to the New Orleans Fringe Festival and will be performing the show as part of their 5th Annual Festival!
For more information on the show, us, etc please log on to www.lillusioncomique.info.


What We Need & What You Get
$14,500 is an interesting number. While it is quite a large amount and sometimes seems insurmountable on our end, we know that with your genrous support and word of mouth we can raise it as easily as if it were $14.50.
 
What that $14,500 will go towards is:
*Paying off our venue(s)
*Transportation for our scenary, costumes etc.
*Production value (ie costumes, make-up, set, music etc.)
*If we are accepted to the New Orleans Festival it will help provide housing and travel for our actors and crew as well as other costs
*Marketing
*Transportation/easing the cost of our outreach to high schools
*Miscelaneous other costs including, but not limited to printing costs, rentals fees, application fees for the various opportunities we are looking into, etc.
 
In return, we have some really wonderful ""Thank You"" perks to offer, as well as all the love and gratitude we have for helping us tell this story again!
 
With your generous support we can bring this forgetten theatrical gem to a whole new audience, here in New York and elsewhere.
 

The Impact
This play is really something unlike anything else. It is funny, provacative, heartwarming, inspiring and above all: entertaining.
In the forward to the 1636 publication of M. Corneille’s manuscript for L’illusion Comique, addressed to the mysterious Madame M F D R, Corneille describes the play as <<un estrange monstre>> translating into English as “a strange monster”.  And that is exactly what the play is. It is at once confined to the French Academy’s criteria for drama: one setting, one day, real time; but it also takes us far from Alcandre’s lair, backwards in time and the illusions we see take place over a period of two years.  It is Baroque in its aesthetic and language, but timeless in its story and themes of love, loss, despair, hope and a theatrical good time.
M. Corneille’s play is full of enough themes and motifs to fill an entire semester of a philosophy class (dealing heavily with Carl Jungian theories of the universal unconcious [centuries before Jung was born!], cognitive disonance, the expectations of parents and of an audience are just a few to name). Ultimately though, the play is about the balance between reality and illusion. The human condition will always be in the balance of what we perceive (illusion) and what is real (truth).  If storytelling is the greatest gift the human race will leave behind (which it is), we will always be victims of our own good stories. Especially living in the technological age, where illusions are so readily available and easy to manipulate upon a computer screen to be told over a cloud to listeners all over the globe, the balance of reality and illusion and human connection is one we shall teeter on forever.
This play speaks to all on a personal level as well: like Clindor, we all eventually leave our father’s home (on more amicable terms, perhaps) and we all like to hope that after all these years and all our separate misadventures, our fathers and we can still look past our own illusions and find each other in the bayou.

<p>On May 10th and 11th, a group of thirteen talented actors from The New School's Eugene Lang College will produce a piece of work at La MaMa's Experimental Theatre Club that will challenge and surprise audiences with it's examination of America's obsession with gender, murder and violence. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Reza Abdoh, an Iranian-born playwright, was considered ""the next great
artist of the theatre world"" before his tragic death of AIDS in 1995 at
the age of 32. We think the themes in his play ""The Law Of Remains"" are as relevant today as
they were in 1991, when the play first premiered in New York City. We
want to continue to push boundaries, challenge ourselves, and redefine
what theatre can do to motivate and change lives. Under the direction of Zishan Ugurlu we hope to combine Abdoh's creative mind with our diligent process and fresh insight, to pinpoint some of the ideas that define our generation and our country.</p>
<p><br/>As you are aware, during these times of economic hardship and
uncertainty, arts funding has been severely reduced nationwide. We
have been allocated $2,000 dollars from our institution to put together a multimedia
theatrical event that includes lights, costumes, sets, advertising, and
myriad other expenses.  We hope to make our senior thesis a memorable
and moving experience for our community as well as a testament to our
own commitment to honoring Reza Abdoh's unquestionable effect on New York City's performance world. Whatever you can give will
make a critical difference in our success. Whatever you can afford will make a critical difference in
re-imagining this fascinating work by Reza Abdoh. We thank you in advance
for your generosity and we'll see you at the show!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>First of all, thank you so much for checking out this campaign! This project means a lot to us and we appreciate that you took the time out of your life to give us a read.</p>
<p>Front of House Productions was created by Hayley Carr, Megan Powell, and Iain Stewart to provide a creative and co-operative environment for any artist that has had to compromise or sacrifice their work in order to pay the rent. Our goal is to create challenging and risky theatre, by giving artists the freedom to explore and produce work that inspires them.</p>
<p>For our inaugural production we will be putting on John-Paul Sartre’s classic play “No Exit,” adapted by Paul Bowles, and this is where we need your help. All the funds from this campaign will go towards making this show a reality, and launching Front of House Productions. </p>
<p>Though written in the 1940s, “No Exit” remains extremely relevant and provocative today. Set in an unassuming room, we encounter three recently deceased characters that are fated to spend eternity locked in a room together. They enter expecting fire and brimstone, yet it is slowly revealed that, in fact, “Hell is other people”, that their fellow prisoners will serve as the judge and jury for their sins on Earth.</p>
<p>In this era of Youtube, Twitter, and Facebook, where the all-seeing eye of a globalized media community never blinks, we believe this story is universally relevant. We are no longer able to hide our embarrassing slip-ups or dirty little secrets when camera phones are everywhere and reality television demands a constant stream of scandal and villains. The questions that Jean-Paul Sartre asks in “No Exit” are still vital today; Are we responsible for the choices we make? If we truly have free will to make these choices do we really feel remorse? And finally, if there is no divine judgment where do we find absolution for the demons that live behind our public faces?</p>
<p>By donating to our campaign you will be helping us put on this amazing show and launching a new theatre company, providing emerging artists with the opportunity to make theatre that is challenging and interesting, and allowing us to have more creative control over the entire process. In the end you will be helping to make theatre more engaging for you, the audience!</p>
<h3><strong>What we need</strong></h3>
<p>This is our first endeavor as a production company, and with no government funding we have been working for over a year, fundraising and networking to get the money to cover the initial expenses, now we need your help to cover the last leg of the journey. All of the costs broken down below are the BARE MINIMUM of what it takes to get a show up and running in Toronto, every dime of our proposed goal would be going towards our debut production of “No Exit.” If we exceed our goal (which would be amazing!) all the extra proceeds would go directly towards funding Front of House Production’s future projects.</p>
<h3>Our Budget</h3>
<p>Rehearsal space: $700</p>
<p>Performance space: $1300</p>
<p>Performance rights: $525</p>
<p>Sets and costumes: $250</p>

<h3>O, Fallen One: Our Story</h3>
<p>""It shall be so, Madness in great ones must not unwatched go.""</p>
<p>Jaymie Bellous and Megan Ruble, co-producers, co-creaters, and the director and leading actress for <em>O, Fallen One</em> are both recent graduates of UC, Irvine.  While there, they both studied both Shakespeare and UCI's particular brand of movement, which stems from modern dance and mime technique. Out of the college world and into the real one, they stumbled upon the Hollywood Fringe Festival.  Brimming with excitement, knowledge, and creativity they thought ""Why not?"" and embarked on the journey that led to this project's creation.</p>
<p><em>O, Fallen One</em> is the result of this communion of creativity.  <span>On the surface, Ophelia has always appeared to be the perfect image of fairness and beauty. Slowly losing control of her own life, Ophelia is left to find her own escape from a world of restraint, deceit, and loss. Through movement, sound, and poetry, <em>O, Fallen One</em> explores what Shakespeare’s fallen damsel would dream, imagine, and recall as she descends to her death.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Your assistance will help us make this a reality.  Funds will be appropriated to the following areas:</p>

<li>Programs            </li>
</ul>
<p>While some of these are just needed to make our show happen, budget items such as working with the Fringe and advertising are needed to make our show a success.  If the Indiegogo community is incredibly supportive and we exceed our goal, we can continue to develop the show after Fringe.  Your support could even help us create new works after the success of <em>O, Fallen One</em>.  </p>
<p>Don't forget to check out the perks we offer!  We have some unique gifts to offer that will enhance your experience of our show before and after.  Most notably, we have premium seats: a HUGE perk or a convenient tool if you're play-hopping during the Festival.  </p>

<h3>For the Doubtful</h3>
<p>We truely believe in this project not only as a great artistic feat but as a necessary experience.  The Shakespeare lovers of the world will love our piece, but it is the women of the world, especially those struggling with abusive relationships, emotionally damaging families, suicidal thoughts or those that are held back from independent thought by ANY person, that will benefit most.  To see the story told of a young woman whipped about by the winds of the men in her life, and to see how her future may, or may not have been played out would be a tribute to the struggles of every woman.</p>

<p>Hi! My name is Rachel, and I am the producer of Arts Alliance's spring mainstage, <em>Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson</em>, coming to the Norris Center of Northwestern University May 16-18. This ""in your face"" rock musical is entirely student produced... and it needs your support to help fund it!</p>
<p>-----</p>
<h3>""My name is Andrew Jackson, and I'm here to speak with you about the future of this incredible country!""</h3>
<p><em>Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson</em> redefines America's seventh President as an emo rock star—spiky hair and 'guyliner' included! With angsty anthems and lusty ballads, Jackson and the rest of the band will lead us through his struggles with populism, the Indian Removal Act, and his relationship with his wife Rachel. Ninety minutes of self-cutting, dick jokes, political idealism, and screamo music, <em>Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson </em>is the loudest, wildest, and <em>bloodiest</em> concert you'll see this spring.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<h3>""These are complicated times, and today we're going to need to make some complicated decisions!""</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p><em>Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson</em> is the event of the season—and it's completely student-produced! To make this show as big as it can possibly be, we as a team must raise at least $5000. Although ticket sales will help us recoup a portion of these funds at the end of our process, we have many more aspects to pay for before the show even opens! These include the set, lights, sound, costumes, props, hair &amp; makeup, advertising, and the coolest theatrical element of all... blood! (Fake, of course!)</p>
<p>We have a bunch of awesome perks to offer to the right of this page for every person who donates money to the show. However, <em>every</em> donation is appreciated, from $5 to $5000, because it means we're one step closer to putting on an incredible show.</p>
<p>-----</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>""But we're gonna make those decisions together! I'm promising you transparency, accountability, and open collaboration between you and me.""</h3>
<p>Arts Alliance, the oldest and largest student arts group at Northwestern and in the country, is committed to providing diverse, accessible, and fulfilling artistic experiences in order to enrich the Northwestern University and Evanston communities. In truth, <em>Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson</em> could not be funded without the generous donations from the people who matter most to the entire cast and team—our families, our friends, our teachers, our mentors, etc. We appreciate every donation we receive, no matter how large or small!</p>
<p>-----</p>

My name is Rachel, and I am the producer of Arts Alliance's spring mainstage, Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson, coming to the Norris Center of Northwestern University May 16-18. This ""in your face"" rock musical is entirely student produced... and it needs your support to help fund it!
-----
""My name is Andrew Jackson, and I'm here to speak with you about the future of this incredible country!""
Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson redefines America's seventh President as an emo rock star—spiky hair and 'guyliner' included! With angsty anthems and lusty ballads, Jackson and the rest of the band will lead us through his struggles with populism, the Indian Removal Act, and his relationship with his wife Rachel. Ninety minutes of self-cutting, dick jokes, political idealism, and screamo music, Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson is the loudest, wildest, and bloodiest concert you'll see this spring.
-----
""These are complicated times, and today we're going to need to make some complicated decisions!""


Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson is the event of the season—and it's completely student-produced! To make this show as big as it can possibly be, we as a team must raise at least $5000. Although ticket sales will help us recoup a portion of these funds at the end of our process, we have many more aspects to pay for before the show even opens! These include the set, lights, sound, costumes, props, hair & makeup, advertising, and the coolest theatrical element of all... blood! (Fake, of course!)
We have a bunch of awesome perks to offer to the right of this page for every person who donates money to the show. However, every donation is appreciated, from $5 to $5000, because it means we're one step closer to putting on an incredible show.
-----


""But we're gonna make those decisions together! I'm promising you transparency, accountability, and open collaboration between you and me.""
Arts Alliance, the oldest and largest student arts group at Northwestern and in the country, is committed to providing diverse, accessible, and fulfilling artistic experiences in order to enrich the Northwestern University and Evanston communities. In truth, Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson could not be funded without the generous donations from the people who matter most to the entire cast and team—our families, our friends, our teachers, our mentors, etc. We appreciate every donation we receive, no matter how large or small!

<p>Pallas Theatre Collective is excited to be producing a staged reading of the new Poe-inspired musical <em>Usher</em>, on June 22<sup>nd</sup> in Washington DC, directed by artistic director Tracey Chessum. In July, we offer <em>The Tragical Mirth of Marriage and Love</em>, short scenes by Anton Chekhov selected and directed by Ty Hallmark, at the Capital Fringe festival in DC and at two locations in Maryland.</p>
<p>Please help support our Table Read of <em>Usher</em>. Based on Edgar Allan Poe’s story “The Fall of the House of Usher,” this new show asks: how far would you go to keep those you loved from leaving? When painter James Cleary is summoned to the Usher mansion to paint a portrait of his ailing childhood friend, he falls in love with his friend’s sister Madeline only to uncover a sinister vein running through the Usher family line that rocks the house to its foundation. We are excited to announce that lyricist Molly Fox and composer Sarah Hirsch will be joining us for rehearsals and this special performance.</p>
<p>Please help support <em>The Tragical Mirth of Marriage and Love</em>, too. Some marriages are farcical, some are tragical, but all are challenging! Famous nineteenth-century playwright Anton Chekhov wrote a series of amusing short scenes about love and marriage. Our actors trace the course of surprisingly modern relationships as they flow from courtship to family duty – not forgetting the experience of dealing with the in-laws. From “The Proposal” to “The Wedding” to “The Anniversary,” Chekhov’s work examines the human impulse to make melodrama out of life events.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Making good theatre isn’t easy – or cheap. Pallas is careful with our pennies, but we need help to our ambitious summer season fly.</p>
<p>Here’s what our funds, and your donations, make possible:</p>
<p>Printing: We print musical scores for <em>Usher</em> and scripts for <em>The Tragical Mirth of Marriage and Love</em>, which adds up to $365. We need to make sure potential audiences know what’s going on, and although we can do a lot of social media outreach, we still have to print posters and postcards for events at a cost of $205. We also need about $115 to print playbills and flyers so our audiences have something in hand identifying the show and the work of the artists.</p>
<p>Design and Production: Our productions are deliberately spare. Instead of focusing on tricky scenery or glorious fabric, our actors focus on their performance and our audiences can focus on the story. But we still need to create an environment that will support the story so our scenic budget is $150 with an additional $100 to cover props. Our actors have to look and feel in-character on stage; we’ve budgeted $250 to cover everything from petticoats to shoes for <em>The Tragical Mirth of Marriage and Love.</em></p>
<p>Spaces: The Capital Fringe participation fee of $575 ensures we have a great performance space for <em>The Tragical Mirth of Marriage and Love</em> in Washington DC. <em>Usher</em> will be presented at Studio 1469 in Washington DC. One night at this unique multipurpose venue costs us $250, plus an additional $250 refundable deposit.</p>
<p>Personnel: Our artists love theatre but they are also trained professionals who deserve to be paid for their work – or at least to cover the gas money they spend going to and fro. We want to take care of our people, so we estimate needing $1900 to pay our artists. How did we reach this figure? Paying 7 actors just $50 each for their work in <em>Usher</em> will cost $350, and offering 9 actors a $100 stipend for weeks of work on <em>The Tragical Mirth of Marriage and Love</em> adds up to $900. For the musical, we also need to hire a professional accompanist for four days, and we offered a $250 award to the creators of <em>Usher</em> for having the winning submission in our selection process.</p>
<p>What you get: Donors get the immense satisfaction of helping a small theatre company produce interesting new work with great artists. Is that not enough? Well, we have some other great perks! Our audience is our biggest asset and we want everyone to experience a Pallas show, so we’re giving away tickets to all our shows, as well as limited edition Pallas t-shirts, special event invitations, and (for those over age 21) we offer a donor gift of wine hand-picked by our artistic director.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>There are lots of great little theatre companies, so what makes Pallas Theatre Collective special? Pallas is committed to producing new works, especially musicals. America has a great tradition of creating innovative, beautiful Musical Theatre works, but today it can be a challenge for creators to find a place for new shows. Most theatres want to see a proven track record before they will produce a musical. Pallas Theatre exists to bridge this gap. Here, creators workshop their musical in front of a live audience and have the opportunity for the show to evolve into a full production. America also has a great tradition of revisiting and reimagining classic dramas. Pallas provides a home for creative artists to reinvent older works that speak to us in new ways.</p>
<p>Pallas already has a record of producing creative new works and adaptations. Pallas’s first production in 2011 was <em>The Many Women of Troy</em>, a new musical inspired by Euripides’ <em>Trojan Women</em> and written by Michael John Boynton and Brian Allan Hobbs. <em>The Many Women of Troy</em> time-traveled to specific eras, exploring how violence affects women’s lives across history. Tracey Chessum adapted Shakespeare’s <em>Comedy of Errors</em> as <em>The Comedy of Mirrors. </em>Following this, Pallas offered the gender-bending<em> <em>Criss-Cross Cabaret</em>, </em>original pieces developed by actors. Recently, Tracey helmed a dark journey through the psychological underpinnings of <em>The Tempest: Such Stuff as Dreams are Made On</em>. We’ve produced at the Hollywood Fringe in LA and the Capital Fringe Festival in DC, as well as at Bus Boys &amp; Poets and in found spaces in Maryland.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Although we need funds to support our projects, your presence is also a gift. Regardless of donation size, you can continue to help us by attending our shows and bringing your friends!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello lovely humans! My name is Faeryn and my hoop sister here is Ahni Radvanyi. Together we are the Electric Fairies, two hoop dancing fairies who live to share our dance! We are so excited to have been chosen to be a part of the Electric Forest 2013 Hoop Troupe of the Electric Forest festival in Rothbury Michigan. However, The Electric Fairies are based in Venice CA and the festival can't pay for our travel expenses to get out to Michigan. Neither can we, unfortunately. But rather than let this extraordinary opportunity to launch our professional dance careers slip from our hands, we open it up to you, our beloved fans, friends and family, to help us share our art and our love for hoop dance with the folks back East. Give what you can, get some fun perks in exchange, and help the Electric Fairies move forward on our journey toward success!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need two roundtrip plane tickets to Michigan which right now are running about $550.</p>
<p>The last bit of change (about $100) we need to help pay for gas on a rideshare between the airport and the festival and back to the airport.</p>
<p>Our perks are little tokens representing the Electric Fairies spirit and flare. Our wrist fluffies and tails are costume pieces we wear for each of our performances and videos. Of course, we love hoops of all styles and sizes and would love to place your very own hoop in your hands! We can't wait to see you discover the magic of hoop dance too! Our Hoop Journey Starter kit, consisting of your very own hoop plus one private hoop dance lesson, is the best way to launch into your new hoop and begin your journey into hoop dance!</p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal, we might not make it to our performance in the Forest, but we will use the money you contribute to move forward on the goals of the Electric Fairies performance duo. We need to pay for the creation of a professional logo, promotional materials, and performance reels. We also would love to accuire professional facepaints to expand our event offerings. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By supporting our campaign you are stupporting the expression of our art and our ability to share this art with a new audience. We live to share the art of hoop dance and desire so deeply to share our unique expression of this art to the folks back east in Michigan. We havn't ever had the chance to see our countrymen and women in the far East but we are sure they will be touched and inspired by the California freedom and outrageous spirit the Electric Fairies bring. </p>

CHI SIAMO
L'Atelier Teatro Fisico è un'associazione culturale no-profit nata per promuovere il concetto di teatro fisico e per sviluppare un programma di formazione delle arti performative (teatro, mimo, danza, musica, le arti circensi e altro) innovativo e unico nel suo genere in Italia.
Fondato nel 1995 da Philip Radice, L’ATF è un luogo di aggregazione dove i professionisti e gli aspiranti giovani artisti possono incontrarsi per un reciproco e stimolante scambio artistico e culturale. Con il tempo L’ATF è diventato un'eccellenza riconosciuta sul territorio piemontese, in Italia e all’estero, e assieme ad altre realtà cittadine, scuole di circo e di teatro, abbiamo contribuito a rilanciare Torino come importante centro culturale e artistico.
La nostra Associazione non si limita alla formazione di attori e artisti di arti performative, ma dà la possibilità ad ogni giovane di esprimere il proprio talento e la propria unicità mettendosi costantemente in gioco tramite laboratori, spettacoli e rassegne organizzati da noi. 
ESSERE O NON ESSERE
Dal 9 marzo 2013 le nostre attività sono a rischio! A seguito di un'ispezione del Comune di Torino, la parte seminterrata dei locali dell'Atelier é stata chiusa, in quanto non idonea alle normative di legge. Ciò ha comportato un impedimento del normale svolgimento delle attività, mettendo a rischio la sopravvivenza stessa dell'Atelier e in difficoltà tutti i giovani artisti che lo frequentano.
Per la ristrutturazione dell'Atelier abbiamo bisogno di circa 45.000-50.000 euro, cifra assolutamente fuori portata per la nostra associazione. È per questo che ci rivolgiamo ad ognuno di voi, agli appassionati sostenitori delle arti performative, spettatori, amici teatranti, e artisti, a chi crede nell’arte come parte indispensabile dell’esperienza umana: non lasciate che l'Atelier Teatro Fisico Philip Radice chiuda.
L' Atelier Teatro Fisico Philip Radice è uno spazio in cui ogni giovane può trovare la propria identità, grazie all’incontro con persone capaci di guidarlo verso una crescita artistica e personale. Un luogo dove ogni individuo, nell'incontro e nella scoperta della diversità dell'altro, trova il proprio originale talento ed una personale ""idea di teatro"". Un luogo libero, stimolante, creativo, ma anche economicamente accessibile a tutti.
AZIONE – Entrate in scena
La vostra donazione* ci aiuterà per rimettere a norma la parte seminterrata della scuola, adeguando gli impianti di areazione, il sistema elettrico e il riscaldamento. E’ prevista anche la ristrutturazione di una sala al piano superiore, dove verrà allestito un piccolo teatro nel quale poter organizzare i nostri Performing Party, serate di cabaret in cui i giovani dell'Atelier si misurano col pubblico presentando i loro numeri. Inoltre, sarà così possibile realizzare la sesta edizione della rassegna di teatro comico POTPOURRI, momentaneamente sospesa.

ATELIER TEATRO FISICO PHILP RADICE 
In 1995, Philip Radice founded the no-profit cultural center, ATELIER TEATRO FISICO to promote the concept of physical theatre and develop in Italy an innovative and unique educational program for the performance arts. Today the Atelier Teatro Fisico is a center of creativity and education where young artist can encounter qualified teachers and professionals for reciprocal stimulating exchanges. Overtime we have become well known in the region Piedmont, in Italy and abroad alongside other artistic realities like circus schools, which have contributed to the rebirth of Turin as an important cultural and artistic center.

Consequently, an ordinance was issued immediately blocking their use, which effectively halted normal activity, putting at risk the survival of the ATELIER, and making it difficult to continue the studies of the young artists who are enrolled.
The cost of renovating and adapting the spaces to the norms which would permit us to reopen the space and, thus, to continue our normal activities, would amount close to €45.000-€50.000 ($59,000-65,000,00 dollars). An expense unsustainable for our limited resources! 
ACTION – Enter on Stage

<p>Middle Eastern dance is very wide and diverse. There is a wonderful array of talent but also a great lack of education. After living in San Diego for 15 years I realize that what is lacking is a strong feeling of community. Most dancers and dance studios work by themselves. I have looked at other areas of the dance world wide to see how they pull their communities together. Through this research I realize that what is missing is base education in this field.

Middle Eastern dance is very wide and diverse. There is a wonderful array of talent but also a great lack of education. After living in San Diego for 15 years I realize that what is lacking is a strong feeling of community. Most dancers and dance studios work by themselves. I have looked at other areas of the dance world wide to see how they pull their communities together. Through this research I realize that what is missing is base education in this field. We do have good people, with great talent in the area who are willing to share their knowledge. There is a vast wealth of knowledge just waiting to be tapped into.

Then I decided to take some time off to refocus and to develop Calling Names. I am so very excited to announce that on Saturday and Sunday, February 23 and 24, 2013 Calling Names will premier as part of SANKOFA, a program of new and classic work, Saturday and Sunday, February 23 and 24th, 2013 at Brooklyn’s brand new BAM Fisher, Fishman Space! It is an enormous honor to be able to be among the very first independently produced artists to show work at this brand new, beautiful, state of the art venue, it is also a very, very expensive.   We are this close to success and we need your help to make it to the finish line.</p>
<p>We need to raise $10,000 to cover final production and design costs in a union house as well as to be able to more fully compensate the performers for the time and commitment they have invested in the creation and development of this work. They have worked hard and long to bring my vision to the stage and their labors deserve to be compensated. If we don’t meet our goal we might lose this opportunity. We truly have a critical need for your support today.</p>
<p>Please help us save our SANKOFA season. The season is named SANKOFA to celebrate the <em>Akan</em> principle which invites us to move forward in full awareness and embrace of what has come before-- to look both ways. In addition to featuring <strong>Calling Names’</strong> debut, we will also present a fully remounted production of <strong>Bearers</strong>, a classic MUV work. This opportunity to present work in one of the most esteemed houses for contemporary performance helps us to move both the work and our profile to a higher level with important funders, new audiences and the media.</p>
<p>All gifts are appreciated. Every contribution gets us closer to our goal. Even if you cannot give cash today, please help spread the word by sharing this link and telling at least 10 friends about MUV and SANKOFA. Finally, please come out and see the show, tickets will be on sale soon!</p>

At the height of the Japanese occupation of Korea 13-year-old Heewon is sold into sexual slavery.  Five years and two occupiers later she escapes her brutal existence by marrying an American officer who whisks her away to a small, Midwestern suburb.  Desperate to create a new life and, more importantly, protect her daughter from her shameful past, she turns her back on the girl she once was.  But that girl will not be silenced, transforming instead into Ghost Girl who relentlessly terrorizes Heewon and, in turn, her daughter, Moran, driving them both to commit increasingly unreasonable, desperate acts. Will mother and daughter be able to exorcise the Ghost Girl from their lives or will she destroy them both?
 
The Genesis:
In April of 2000 a bright, funny, accomplished, overachieving MIT student took her own life by setting herself on fire.  What could possess anyone, let alone someone so seemingly happy and successful, to take their own life in such a brutal and horrific way?  It was this question that set playwright Sue Pak on the psychological, historical, and ultimately personal, journey that culminated in the writing of this powerful, provocative and magical new play: Ghost Girl.  

 

What we need and what you get:
We are fundraising primarily to help us fully realize our production design concept.  Ghost Girl spans twenty years and two continents and the visual elements are crucial to the storytelling.  We want our designers to have every resource at their disposal to take their incredible ideas to fruition.  Take a look at some of our design sketches to see what you will be funding.  No amount is too small to help!  
 

Vital Statistics:
Ghost Girl will be performed August 18-21 at the Workshop Theater.  Thurs-Sat at 8pm, Sat & Sun at 2pm
 
Tickets are FREE!  Reservations are STRONGLY recommended as we're selling out fast.  Please reserve tickets by contacting: GhostGirlPlay@gmail.com

When Representative Gabrielle Giffords took a bullet to the head, we had some questions, like,“WHY?!” Through discussion we realized, “Hey, this thing is a little complicated”. So we started asking our friends, families, strangers at bars, and ‘The Interwebs’. They told us things, and we put those things into a play...</span><br/><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;white-space:normal !important;""></span><br/><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;white-space:normal !important;"">That was hard. And then we realized it’s even more complicated than we first thought. So we gave up. We did. We can’t answer it on our own. We can’t create the play without your perspective. We need to open up a dialogue with everyone we can get our hands on. With you. Because we realize... the conversation is the answer. Or at least the possibility for one. We want to talk about something that many of us are too afraid to even think about—the potential in a human being to commit a heinous act of violence.</span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;white-space:normal !important;""> </span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;white-space:normal !important;""></span><br/><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;white-space:normal !important;""></span><br/><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;white-space:normal !important;"">We did our homework.

From the Blog
Hi Everyone, Our American Myth is coming! And as we hurtle towards our opening night, and the end of our IndieGoGo campaign, we have a ton of exciting news to kick off our opening week: 

Our American Myth Livestreams Opening Night to the World:
Thanks to Arena Stage's New Play Institute, we will be able to stream our opening night shenanigans to all of you outside the Bay on#NewPlay TV. And you can talk to us and about the show on the twitter hashtag #OAM. Can't wait to see you there on Thursday at 8:00pm! 
Meet Our Heroes (and get your own piece of Our American Myth!)
We've spoken of our the tale of a brave and conflicted politician, and the patriotic and idealistic young man who is ultimately driven to shoot her. And now you can meet our heroes. We present to you, The CITIZEN and The Cowgirl Myth, a comic and story-book story created just for our show. Check them out, and for the next three days while our IndieGoGo campaign is active, you can 
DONATE AND GET YOUR COPY BEFORE WEDNESDAY:




The Show
What would you kill for?  At what point does violence become the best option?  Why do we have such a strong heritage of political violence in America?Part drama, part debate, part poetry and entirely entertaining, Bindlepunks’ newest production examines these questions and more.Join us as we weave a new American myth: the tale of a brave and conflicted politician and the patriotic and idealistic young man who is ultimately driven to shoot her.  Throughout this story of ambition and betrayal, the actors step out of the action to explore how our American culture, ideals, and politics create a breeding ground for acts of violence.Power.  Violence.  Politics.  Free speech.  Guns.  Share your insights with us, as we share ours with you.



The Impact

Someone got shot, and we wanted to understand why. When Representative Gabrielle Giffords took a bullet to the head, we had some questions, like,“WHY?!” Through discussion we realized, “Hey, this thing is a little complicated”. So we started asking our friends, families, strangers at bars, and ‘The Interwebs’. They told us things, and we put those things into a play...That was hard. And then we realized it’s even more complicated than we first thought. So we gave up. We did. We can’t answer it on our own. We can’t create the play without your perspective. We need to open up a dialogue with everyone we can get our hands on. With you. Because we realize... the conversation is the answer. Or at least the possibility for one. We want to talk about something that many of us are too afraid to even think about—the potential in a human being to commit a heinous act of violence. We did our homework. We did a TON of homework. And the one thing we learned is that we don’t know enough. We can only speak for--How many of us are there? Seven?--seven people living in America. If we don’t talk about it beyond the tragic, bite-sized headlines, we believe we’ll just be setting ourselves up for another tragic shock a few years down the line.So come to the show and talk with us.




What We Need

We need:$1000 to pay all of the wonderful artists involved in the production$1000 for props, costumes, and sound/lighting equipment$1500 to pay for the rehearsal space$500 for printing postcards, fliers and programsOur artists, on average, are putting in about 100 hours to this project. We’ve promised them a minimum stipend of $100, but we would like to pay them an amount closer to what their time is actually worth. Any extra funds received will go towards paying the artists a respectable sum, and the further development of this project.

Other Ways You Can Help

Story Theater Company’s Teen Actors Present “David and Lisa”</b></p>
<p>Story Theater Company is a not-for-profit children’s
theater company that has been providing theatrical education and performance
opportunities for the children and youth of central Iowa since 2006.  We are raising funds to stage the full-length
play “David and Lisa”, which will represent a first for Story Theater
Company:  a play designed, produced, and
performed by our teens.  The inspiration
to stage this play came from the youth themselves as a natural extension of
Story Theater Company’s Teen Theater Club. 
The club met with immediate success after its formation in 2012, and
Story Theater Company recognized the demand for even more teen theater
programming.  </p>
<p>The show selected is “David and Lisa”, James Reach’s
powerful drama about two troubled teens who meet up and make a connection at a
school for delinquent adolescents.  The
script has a large ensemble of fascinating and compelling characters and
provides the teens with the chance to tackle some challenging subject matter.  Auditions will be held in mid-December, and three
performances of “David and Lisa” will be staged February 28-March 2.  </p>
<p><b>What We Need </b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Our goal is to
raise $1400 to complete the funding for this teen theater production.  “David and Lisa” has the full support of
Story Theater Company.  The teens will
have access to Story Theater Company’s scene shop, costumes, and supplies.  Story Theater Company has also hired two excellent
instructors/directors for the show and is providing much of the funding.  But theater is expensive, and a programming
expansion of this magnitude just isn’t in Story Theater Company’s annual
budget.  So we need your help.</p>

<p>Originally produced by Montreal theatre company Stadium Tour, the VICIOUSTRALIA tour will be co-produced with Australian production company Weeping Spoon Productions, run by Shane Adamczak.</p>
<p>The tour will begin in Perth, at Blue Room Theatre's PICA Performance Space, as part of the Fringe World festival, on February 10th to 15th 2014.This will be followed by a run of several weeks in February-March 2014 at Tuxedo Cat as part of the Adelaide Fringe.  </p>
<p>With bookings completed and lodging arrangements already taken care of, we now need to raise money to send the the cast and crew to Oz! Plane tickets range from $2000 to $2500 each, which will cost a total of between $8000 and $10000 - and that's not counting the cost of <b>FEEDING</b> them once they get there, and the various props and settings that we need to purchase for the show...<br/></p>
<p>Being an underfunded, non-profit organization, and <b>with no thanks to the Harper government's elimination of nearly every available grant for the arts</b>, Stadium Tour simply cannot afford the cost of these plane tickets.<br/></p>
<p>That's where you come in, dear patrons of the arts. The actors and director  are trying to save up as much as they can to help pay their way - but with fairly low wages and non-salaried work, it is not enough. </p>
<p>The money raised on Indiegogo will go to reduce the cost of each ticket - <b>if we make our minimum</b>, it will cut the costs roughly in half, and if we can <b>double our minimum</b> then we can send <b>everyone</b> there, and any extra above that will go towards food for the actors and materials for the show.</p>
<p>Check out our awesome perks and give what you can! Donators can choose from a wide array of packages, some of which include souvenir posters, soundtracks, t-shirts, and even reproductions of the Johnny, Sid, and Nancy sock puppets that are used in the show!!          <br/></p>

Originally produced by Montreal theatre company Stadium Tour, the VICIOUSTRALIA tour will be co-produced with Australian production company Weeping Spoon Productions, run by Shane Adamczak.
The tour will begin in Perth, at Blue Room Theatre's PICA Performance Space, as part of the Fringe World festival, on February 10th to 15th 2014.This will be followed by a run of several weeks in February-March 2014 at Tuxedo Cat as part of the Adelaide Fringe.  
With bookings completed and lodging arrangements already taken care of, we now need to raise money to send the the cast and crew to Oz! Plane tickets range from $2000 to $2500 each, which will cost a total of between $8000 and $10000 - and that's not counting the cost of FEEDING them once they get there, and the various props and settings that we need to purchase for the show...
Being an underfunded, non-profit organization, and with no thanks to the Harper government's elimination of nearly every available grant for the arts, Stadium Tour simply cannot afford the cost of these plane tickets.
That's where you come in, dear patrons of the arts. The actors and director  are trying to save up as much as they can to help pay their way - but with fairly low wages and non-salaried work, it is not enough. 
The money raised on Indiegogo will go to reduce the cost of each ticket - if we make our minimum, it will cut the costs roughly in half, and if we can double our minimum then we can send everyone there, and any extra above that will go towards food for the actors and materials for the show.
Check out our awesome perks and give what you can! Donators can choose from a wide array of packages, some of which include souvenir posters, soundtracks, t-shirts, and even reproductions of the Johnny, Sid, and Nancy sock puppets that are used in the show!!

With $30,000 in the bank, our nut is covered and we can get on with producing drama that will not only ensure Ann Arbor's only professional producing theatre stays open for another 30 years, but will empower us to write the next chapter in the Network's story - a space of possibilities for art to flourish. Most importantly, of course, we have cool perks, like this Most Loyal Order of Nut Coverers' (MLONC) T-shirt:


There a bunch of cool perks for investing in our cause, whichever you choose, please accept our thanks in advance for joining us in the fight to keep art alive in Ann Arbor.

Her resume is an eclectic mix from the bizarre to the dramatic. Favorite past credits include: Grusha in ""The Caucasian Chalk Circle"" (AADA Company, NYC), Susan in ""Say No More"" (Inspirato Festival), Dot Matrix in ""The Office Spaceballs"" (Queen's Players Toronto) and Step Mother in the national tour of ""Cinderella"" (Touring Players of Canada). Tracey idolizes strong, female comedic performers such as Andrea Martin, Gilda Radner, Carol Burnett and Lucille Ball.  Catch Tracey, as a series regular, in the new television series ""SomeTV!"" to begin airing in the fall.  ""Bitch. A cathartic purge based on a true story."" marks Tracey's first writing endeavour.</em>
<p><strong>ERIN THOMPSON</strong></p>
<p><em>Erin is a graduate of the Randolph Academy for Performing Arts in Toronto and has recently returned to performing after living it up in the world of corporate marketing. While studying improv at Second City in Toronto, she connected with Tracey, her now friend and collaborator.  Favorite past credits include: Lady Macbeth in ""Macbeth"" (Shakespeare in the Square, Brampton), Shelby Stevens  in ""Steel Pier"" (RAPA), Naomi in ""Naomi In The Living Room"" (RAPA) and Dawn Schweitzer in ""Mean Girls"" (Paramount Pictures). Erin is inspired by quirky, multifaceted female performers such as Toni Collette, Catherine O’Hara, Megan Mullally, and Tina Fey.  ""Bitch.

<p><span>Shapeshift is a multidisciplinary installation utilizing film projection, found object assembly, large apparatus construction and elaborate costumery, activated by acrobatic, pole and aerial dance performance, that will take place in March 2015 at Betti Ono Gallery. The work centers around three unique, but interrelated physical articulations of the imagined or unseen worlds (ie. the spirit world, the other plane) that fuel our existence. The word Shapeshift centralizes the many ways in which the act of shapeshifting (one’s body and one’s surroundings) is a powerful tool for resilience and agency for the artists as queer, Black women. Viewers will explore the mystical environments during a two week period, while characters created and performed by the artists tell their stories of powerful transformation at three live shows.</span></p>

The ART exposes the dark impulses of human nature by tempting a lonely writer to indulge his savage wants and commit something truly awful in order prove his self worth. With guns, knives and typewriters at the ready, you alone are held accountable for your own survival.

This July, the iDiOM Theater in downtown Bellingham, WA is producing the world premiere of two new one-act plays written by young artists from the collegiate community. The Awful Real Thing (The ART) written by Brian Toews and The Velociraptor; A New Work by Rene Vohze written by R. Kent Taylor & Levi Friedman, will premiere back to back with intermission for six evenings July 17, 18, 19 & 24, 25, 26 for $8 @ 8pm. Tickets are available through Brown Paper Tickets:http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/752764idiomtheater.com, and at the door.The ART/The V. is an exciting experimental theatre outing unlike anything you've ever seen. Inspired by the Dadaist art movement, Tim & Eric, South Park,  Andy Kaufman, Odd Future and avant-garde theatre, these one-act plays are new, relevant works that will challenge and entertain audiences, making them burst out laughing and looking away in horror at the same time. As artists we want to bring a breath of fresh air to the theatre scene in Bellingham by sharing with you a satirical fringe spectacle quite unique to the Pacific Northwest, Bellingham and the theatre world. A synopsis of the show is down below.The Awful Real Thing (The ART): In a remote cabin in the Pacific Northwest, failed writer, Matt Tellerman celebrates his birthday alone, cutting himself off from all outside communication but when best friend, Archie, arrives bearing ""a present"", all hell breaks loose. The ART exposes the dark impulses of human nature by tempting a lonely writer to indulge his savage wants and commit something truly awful in order prove his self worth. With guns, knives and typewriters at the ready, you alone are held accountable for your own survival. A vulgar and violent farce about friendship and art.The Velociraptor (The V.) is the newest work from award winning playwright, René Vohzé. Critics are raving, “if you thought life had meaning, you need to see this play, because it doesn’t!” Pierre St. Ives, former dance instructor at Julliard, says, “an incendiary commentary on corporate voyeurism…a critical critique on critics.” Glenn Hergenhahn, Artistic Director of the iDiOM Theater, declares the piece, “Minimalist trash…I’m not sure what I was thinking…God, help me.” Prepare to be delighted, disgusted and utterly transformed as a human being!Comprised of many local players, these works offer a wild and wondrous night of NEW and BOLD theatre. A world premiere like none other, The Awful Real Thing and The Velociraptor are sure to entertain. The show contains nudity, violence and adult language.

Our art team is diligently turning 4th Tap Brewing Co-Op into a powerful gradient of prehistoric biomes. Magnificently vibrant fronds, a full-sized and articulated dinosaur head, TONS of skeletons, black-light iridescent algae and bones - it's going to rule!</p><h2>What is this money used for?</h2><p>$5100 is a lot of money! What’s it going toward?</p><p>First, an important recitation: PWR is free and we want to keep it free. PWR is for everyone, even if they can't afford to pay cover at a show. We'd like to keep from having to charge admission for as long as we can.</p><p>PWR is also now a 80-person organization putting on a show for 1500 people. One and a half thundo! Increased expectations beget increased (and wholly worthwhile) costs: we spent north of $9000, each, to produce our last 2 shows.</p><p>Through diligent saving and prudent investment, we've managed to cap our fundraising goal at ~$5000, depending on the season. We are continuously able to improve the show and make it grander; your support and our careful budgeting have allowed us to do this without ballooning our costs! And it's all on the backs of our beautiful volunteers who submit themselves to the Multiverse out of love. We've survived more than two years as we've grown into the massive wrestling party you know today—and we're not slowing down! Accept no impostors! HELL RIGHT</p><p>Some of the cool things your donations have let us do include:</p><ul>
<li><p>Cooling. We don't want the heat of summer to discourage people from engaging in Party Violence. We're renting a couple of portable AC units to help everyone stay cool n' comfortable! These suckers draw a lot of power, as well, so we're going to get a generator to make sure our electrical system is protected.</p></li>
<li><p>Art and design. We have an extremely talented team of designers who transform the venue into an art piece by using garbage. 4th Tap was turned into a GLOWING, NEON CYBERSCAPE by their selfless, capable hands. The DINOTOPIA they are creating is going to be an immense and lush party zone you won't want to leave! Though most of our resources are scavenged from trash bins and thrift stores, filling a venue of our size with cool decorations—and the storage to keep them preserved show after show!—costs money.</p></li>
<li><p>Safe space/security: PWR is a party for everyone. Our performers have always followed anti-sexist/homophobic/transphobic/racist guidelines, and we wanted to make sure that comfort extends to our audience. We’re proud of our security phone line. Any member of the audience may use this number to report gross behavior at the show, and we resolve the problem, no questions asked. Your support lets us keep reaching toward a goal of ULTIMATE PARTY VIOLENCE for everyone.</p></li>
<li><p>Paying artists. We work hard to make sure everyone who contributes to our production gets some money in exchange—whether our art team, our powerful tech wizards, or our A/V crew.</p></li>
<li><p>Projection and lighting. Huge audiences compel us to try to use every part of our venue—so that all audience members can find a comfortable view of the show. PWR has some of the most advanced lighting for an independent wrestling show in the country! And we built it ourselves, with your help. We still have improvements to make; you'll notice and love our latest generation of lights!</p></li>
<li><p>Training: Party Violence is its own unique sport. We have crafted a training program that makes use of experienced pro-wrestling coaching to help keep our PARTY ATHLETES smooth n' safe.  </p></li>
</ul><p>For transparency: this Indiegogo doesn’t cover all of adolescent PWR’s expenses, but it takes care of a majority of them. Below is our complete budget.<br/><br/><i>Show Expenses: $2450</i><br/><br/>Props: $300<br/>Art: $450<br/>Contruction Projects: $75<br/>Cooling: $550<br/>Staff Food: $80<br/>Promo materials: $100<br/>Security: $160<br/>Insurance: $385<br/>Printing: $150<br/>Training: $200</p><p><i>Operational Expenses: $725</i><br/><br/>Discretionary Show Expenses: $325<br/>New Projects Capital: $400</p><p><i>Other Expenses: $4406</i><br/><br/>Artist and staff pay: $2350<br/>Indiegogo Reward production and fulfillment: $1653<br/>Indiegogo and credit card fees: $403.86</p><div>

What’s it going toward?First, an important recitation: PWR is free and we want to keep it free. PWR is for everyone, even if they can't afford to pay cover at a show. We'd like to keep from having to charge admission for as long as we can.PWR is also now a 80-person organization putting on a show for 1500 people. One and a half thundo! Increased expectations beget increased (and wholly worthwhile) costs: we spent north of $9000, each, to produce our last 2 shows.Through diligent saving and prudent investment, we've managed to cap our fundraising goal at ~$5000, depending on the season. We are continuously able to improve the show and make it grander; your support and our careful budgeting have allowed us to do this without ballooning our costs! And it's all on the backs of our beautiful volunteers who submit themselves to the Multiverse out of love. We've survived more than two years as we've grown into the massive wrestling party you know today—and we're not slowing down! Accept no impostors! HELL RIGHTSome of the cool things your donations have let us do include:
Cooling. We don't want the heat of summer to discourage people from engaging in Party Violence. We're renting a couple of portable AC units to help everyone stay cool n' comfortable! These suckers draw a lot of power, as well, so we're going to get a generator to make sure our electrical system is protected.
Art and design. We have an extremely talented team of designers who transform the venue into an art piece by using garbage. 4th Tap was turned into a GLOWING, NEON CYBERSCAPE by their selfless, capable hands. The DINOTOPIA they are creating is going to be an immense and lush party zone you won't want to leave! Though most of our resources are scavenged from trash bins and thrift stores, filling a venue of our size with cool decorations—and the storage to keep them preserved show after show!—costs money.
Safe space/security: PWR is a party for everyone. Our performers have always followed anti-sexist/homophobic/transphobic/racist guidelines, and we wanted to make sure that comfort extends to our audience. We’re proud of our security phone line. Any member of the audience may use this number to report gross behavior at the show, and we resolve the problem, no questions asked. Your support lets us keep reaching toward a goal of ULTIMATE PARTY VIOLENCE for everyone.
Paying artists. We work hard to make sure everyone who contributes to our production gets some money in exchange—whether our art team, our powerful tech wizards, or our A/V crew.
Projection and lighting. Huge audiences compel us to try to use every part of our venue—so that all audience members can find a comfortable view of the show. PWR has some of the most advanced lighting for an independent wrestling show in the country! And we built it ourselves, with your help. We still have improvements to make; you'll notice and love our latest generation of lights!
Training: Party Violence is its own unique sport. We have crafted a training program that makes use of experienced pro-wrestling coaching to help keep our PARTY ATHLETES smooth n' safe.  
For transparency: this Indiegogo doesn’t cover all of adolescent PWR’s expenses, but it takes care of a majority of them. Below is our complete budget.Show Expenses: $2450Props: $300Art: $450Contruction Projects: $75Cooling: $550Staff Food: $80Promo materials: $100Security: $160Insurance: $385Printing: $150Training: $200Operational Expenses: $725Discretionary Show Expenses: $325New Projects Capital: $400Other Expenses: $4406Artist and staff pay: $2350Indiegogo Reward production and fulfillment: $1653Indiegogo and credit card fees: $403.86

<h3>The Quickie of It.</h3>
<p>I'm a writer, singer and spoken word artist with a new rock/punk musical called <strong>wRETCH</strong>, which has just been accepted into the prestigious <strong>Fresh Fruit Festival</strong> (LGBTQ Arts Fest).  In my 25 years as a writer, I've written many songs, but never a full musical and I am SO excited for this new foray into musical theatre.  This project involves all the things I love: theatre, a strong message, risk-taking, music and women!</p>
<p>This project is so important to me because it is a platform to speak out (sing out!) against the sexism that is rampant in our society.  But not in an angry, ranty kind of way.  In a fun, tongue-in-cheek, sardonic, humorous, intelligent kind of way.  For many of the songs, I adopted the Riot Grrrl style of In Your Face lyrics and performance that I love so much.  I'm no wall flower and <strong>wRETCH is a celebration of women who stand UP and stand OUT</strong>.  It is absolutely vital to get the show's message out there: Even though we have so little control in society, we must not take it out on our bodies.  We have to support ourselves and support each other as we thrive!</p>
<p>I've been working on this show for almost a year and getting to the production/performance stage is actually a dream come true.  Not only do I get to realize a show that I believe in with all my heart, but I get to be the lead vocal in a friggin' rock band!  How amazing is that!</p>
<p>Contributions will help us fund this dream project.  When you contribute $1 or $27 or even $567 or more, you are helping to <strong>bring together a team of women who are rocking sexism back on its ass</strong>.  All the artists involved with the project are receiving honorariums.  The venue and some of the tech is all paid for by Festival (thank you FFF!).  But we need sets, lights, sound gear, costumes, props, marketing and, most importantly, I need a sub sandwich that I eat in the 2nd act!</p>
<p><strong>wRETCH</strong> will be presented as part of the Fresh Fruit Festival on July 12, 14 , 15 2017 @ 9pm at The Wild Project. 195 E. 3rd Street, NYC.  Tickets are available at <a href=""http://www.freshfruitfestival.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.freshfruitfestival.com</a>.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How wRETCH was born.</h3>
<p>Last year my 16 year old daughter was hospitalized for twelve weeks for an eating disorder.  I learned how desperately she struggled with having a positive body image.   All the images of successful, happy, sexy, strong women that she saw were of slender women.  Even the women who were considered “big and beautiful” weren’t all that big.  Even though I had told her since she was little to “love herself for who she is, however she is,” the media monster had gotten to her. </p>
<p>I got angry.</p>
<p>According to the National Eating Disorders Association: ""In the United States, 20 million women and 10 million men suffer from a clinically significant eating disorder at some time in their life...”  That means that nearly 1 out of every 10 women/teens/girls and 1 out of every 20 men/teens/boys suffer with an eating disorder at some point in their life.  I ask WHY?</p>
<p>I realized that no matter how many times I told my daughter that she was beautiful, smart and wonderful, <strong>I couldn’t compete with the unrealistic, unattainable, unbelievably narrow concepts of beauty, attractiveness, and sexiness in our culture, all of which are perpetuated by the images in movies, tv, videos, on-line, commercials, ads, and music</strong>.</p>
<p>So I decided to do something about it by writing <strong>wRETCH</strong>.</p>
<p>I’ve heard from my therapist that sublimation is the most productive use of any negative emotion:  turn it into art.  So, I created <strong>wRETCH</strong>.  It’s a response to the current version of the <strong>war on women and femininity which manifests in women, trans women and gay men as eating disorders, body hate, mental health issues, low self esteem and depression</strong>.  </p>
<p><strong>wRETCH</strong> is an intense, hard-hitting, fierce, at times funny as hell, response to sexism and anti-feminism.  The story follows the story of a band called <strong>wRETCH</strong> while they put on their final show.  Throughout the fast-paced 80 minutes, the band sings songs about eating disorders, yes, but also about body image, woman power, sexual autonomy, mental illness and woman/feminine culture (including drag/gay male culture).</p>
<p>Now, 15 months after my daughter was discharged from the hospital, she is maintaining a handle on her eating disorder, with the support of a therapist, a nutritionist, her friends, and me.  </p>
<p>I wrote this show for her and fierce feminine women and men everywhere.  Woman Power!</p>
<h3>The Nuts-n-Bolts</h3>
<p>We need $7,000 to put on this show.  Really, we need $14K, but I'm using $7,000 of my own savings because I believe in this show <u>so much</u>.  I know they say artists shouldn't fund their own work, but I really believe in this show and I don't want to ask you to foot the entire bill.</p>
<p>Where the $14K will go.</p>
<p>$7,000 (approx) will go to pay the Actor/Musicians, Director, Stage Manager, Lighting, Set, Props, Costume, Sound and Make Up Designers.  </p>
<p>$4,000 (approx) will go to production - sets, costumes, props, sound gear rental ($1500 in and of itself), rehearsal rental</p>
<p>$2000 (approx) will go to marketing materials - postcards, flyers, Facebook, ads</p>
<p>$1000 (approx) will go to storage of all the set pieces and musical instruments for the two weeks leading up to the show and during the show, travel expenses and possibly tshirts, if we can get them made.</p>
<p>If we don't make our goal, then funds will be lessened accordingly from the following areas in order: costumes, rehearsal studio rental, sets, make up, marketing, storage, travel expenses, artists' fees.</p>
<h3>#TeamwRETCH</h3>
<p>Alex, Rachel, T, Steph, Deb, Danica, Eli, Emily, Vickie and, Dan are making up this great team who all come from amazing diverse backgrounds.  Deb, Steph and T all come from punk, rock-n-roll backgrounds, Rachel's got opera in her blood, I'm a bluesy, spoken word kinda dyke.  Alex is a physical devised theatre artist, The team's designers are from theatre, music concerts, dance and film.  And Dan is just...well...amazing - as stage manager and all around go-to guy.</p>
<p>Making us look great on social media and communications is Megan Picurro.  Also vital to the team is Victoria Weinberg (line producer) who is passionately dedicated to women in the arts.  Cedric Hill (producer) is the CEO of To &amp; From Productions and  my long time artistic/business partner.</p>

<h3>Trust.</h3>
<p>I've been writing and performing my own original shows for 16 years.  As a DIY performance artist, I revel in the producing, the coordinating, the negotiating, and the collaborating.  I am an out of the box performer.  I like to write my own stories and experiences and play them out on stage in front of a live audience.  I make my own material and produce it myself (with loads of help from people like you and from Festivals like <strong>Fresh Fruit</strong>).  Beyond a shadow of a doubt, I am dedicated to this project.  I will see it through to the very end (and past that, probably).  I have never given up on a project.  And, according to my long-term team mates (directors and producers), I usually put on a great show.  </p>
<p>Please trust that your financial support will be very much appreciated, prudently spent and will help to create a theatrical experience that will thrill our audiences.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Some Risky Business</h3>
<p>There are some risks in putting on a show in Manhattan in July.  The first one is that the audience may not show up.  In order to handle this, I've recruited a large team of people (including three producers) who are going to focus on getting the butts in the seats.  I also have a kick-ass marketing director on board who is creating all our logos, flyers and branding.  (She happens to be a total Riot Grrrl fan, too!)  Another risk at this DIY level is that cast members may get better paying gigs and feel they have to drop out.  I'm confident that even if this happens, we'll be able to catch up with a new cast member and deliver a fantastic show.  A third risk is that the show just won't go ""over.""  To mitigate this risk, we're going to be doing teasers and previews of the show to test it out before showtime at the Fresh Fruit Festival.</p>

<blockquote>Theatre should be a conversation amongst souls: a relationship that is able to take a shortcut past the filters, prejudices, and other shallow inhibitors that keep people from making connections.  It should recharge the humanity that gets drained little by little through day to day life. Everyone has a story to tell.  We at RARE Theatre believe that everyone also has a story to hear. We have a desire to work in theatre because we love telling stories and know the benefits of hearing the right story at the right time. In every production we put forth, we will seek those identifiable moments of humanity and ways to bridge the gap between performer and audience.  We will push to create the best theatre in both acting and production. We believe in collaboration and know that our hard work can make up for small (and sometimes nonexistent) budgets...</blockquote>
<h4>Now for our inaugural production as a group of storytelling professionals (and the reason we need your help!)... Rare Theatre Productions presents...</h4>
<h3>“Crooked,” a play by Catherine Trieschmann:</h3>
<blockquote>Fourteen year old Laney arrives in Oxford, Mississippi with a twisted back, a mother in crisis and a burning desire to be writer. When she befriends Maribel Purdy, a fervent believer in the power of Jesus Christ to save her from the humiliations of High School, Laney embarks on a hilarious spiritual and coming-of-age journey that challenges her mother's secular worldview and threatens to tear their fragile relationship apart.</blockquote>
<blockquote>""The work of a big accomplished writer's voice...a gem of a discovery."" -The New York Times.</blockquote>
<blockquote>""This is a wonderfully neat play, at once simple and complex, grappling with big issues - matters of faith, fantasy and the flesh - while keeping its sneakers firmly planted on the suburban topsoil of adolescent angst and domestic frictions."" - The Daily Telegraph.</blockquote>

</div></div>","First let us introduce ourselves with the RARE Theatre Productions Mission Statement...
Theatre should be a conversation amongst souls: a relationship that is able to take a shortcut past the filters, prejudices, and other shallow inhibitors that keep people from making connections.  It should recharge the humanity that gets drained little by little through day to day life. Everyone has a story to tell.  We at RARE Theatre believe that everyone also has a story to hear. We have a desire to work in theatre because we love telling stories and know the benefits of hearing the right story at the right time. In every production we put forth, we will seek those identifiable moments of humanity and ways to bridge the gap between performer and audience.  We will push to create the best theatre in both acting and production. We believe in collaboration and know that our hard work can make up for small (and sometimes nonexistent) budgets...
Now for our inaugural production as a group of storytelling professionals (and the reason we need your help!)... Rare Theatre Productions presents...
“Crooked,” a play by Catherine Trieschmann:
Fourteen year old Laney arrives in Oxford, Mississippi with a twisted back, a mother in crisis and a burning desire to be writer. When she befriends Maribel Purdy, a fervent believer in the power of Jesus Christ to save her from the humiliations of High School, Laney embarks on a hilarious spiritual and coming-of-age journey that challenges her mother's secular worldview and threatens to tear their fragile relationship apart.
""The work of a big accomplished writer's voice...a gem of a discovery."" -The New York Times.
""This is a wonderfully neat play, at once simple and complex, grappling with big issues - matters of faith, fantasy and the flesh - while keeping its sneakers firmly planted on the suburban topsoil of adolescent angst and domestic frictions."" - The Daily Telegraph.
_____________________________________________________________________________
We are incredibly passionate about theatre, and especially this piece! We want to give you, our audience, the best possible experience!

That's where you come in.  Shows (especially shows that are this awesome) cost money to produce. We are theatre artists, so we are accustomed to working on tight budgets. Therefore, we're grateful for any amount you give us, and will use it in an economical, productive way. We aren't aiming for extravagance, we just want to give the piece justice.


what we need and what you get.

Here's what your contributions will be going towards:- Licensing Rights for the show-Production Materials (Lighting gels, props, paint, lumber, costumes- etc)-Marketing (posters, programs, flyers, ads in local publications)-Rented pieces/materials-We also would love to give financial support to our production team. They are all very talented professionals that are giving of their time and creativity. We want to ensure that they are taken care of and aren't losing money while they are taking care of us.

The production is the brainchild of Lachlan the Bray and Garrett Riley and has been twelve months in the making. It first premiered in June 2015 at the Exit Theater in San Francisco, directed by Mia Romero, before crossing the ocean to Kempsey, Australia. Early 2016 found the production touring regionally throughout the Bay Area, everywhere from Truckee to Bolinas. Now it has been accepted into one of the best known theatrical festivals in the world that is attended by over 75, 000 people annually.  The opportunity for exposure is of huge magnitude -- and we humbly ask your help to get it there!



What's it about?

Rent is costing you a kidney.  Love is fleeting.  Our dependence on pharmaceuticals is slowly killing us. An Australian country boy and an urban vagrant coax spoken-word, rock-n-roll and theatre into a raucous threesome exploring why each and every one of these things are beautiful.  

Why should this happen?Because this is a story about our generation's daily struggles, which we face both as artists and individuals.  The show uses satire, music and of course, spoken word to tell the stories of two polarizing poets navigating an urban landscape by balancing love lives and career moves.  Lachlan the Bray emigrated from Australia in an attempt to ‘make it big!’ and now battles with the choice of commercial success or artistic freedom.  Garrett Riley, a lonesome vagrant rock star on the up, copes with heartbreak that could very well lead to his demise.  The show features a three-piece band that underpins the stories and songs of these two artists, swinging loosely through jazz, blues and rock music.


The style of the production holds the future of collaborative performance arts. Red Lips Woman productions are dedicated to producing empathetic, engaging theatre that will inspire people to change their lives and in turn, the world. RLW was created to serve this purpose, while simultaneously providing strong roles for women (which exists through Mia Romero, our Director and Producer).

<h3>RENO's Theatrical Dance Company</h3>
<p>Founded in 2018 by Artistic Director, Keely Cobb, Around the Stage is a Reno based theatre and dance company comprised of multi-talented performers and theater technicians. Around the Stage has collaboratively created three evening length works in Reno, NV and been guests artists at Reno Little Theater, GhostLight TV and Encompass Academy. </p>
<p>This year, we were so excited to have our Artistic Director, Keely Cobb, selected as one of Artown's commissioned artists. This was a huge honor and allowed the company to plan for a live dance show featuring live music at the Reno City Plaza. Unfortunately, due to COVID-19, we had to cancel every live event we had planned for 2020. This included all of our fundraisers, two months of rehearsals, our guest artist performances, professional development weekends and our Artown show.  Instead of dreading on what could have been, we decided to look to the future and start planning a big season for next year! </p>

<p>Hi, I'm Gretchen Garnett.  Last year I relocated to Amsterdam from San Francisco, where I was running my dance company, Gretchen Garnett &amp; Dancers.  When I arrived, I noticed a lack of venues and performances where young and emerging choregraphers could perform, show work and interact with audiences.  The Stripped Down Dance Salon was created to fill this need and to bring more dance into the Amsterdam community. It is an opportunity for some of Amsterdam's most exciting choreographers, dance makers and performers to connect with audiences and show their work in an informal, low-tech salon setting.  Four local groups, Gretchen Garnett &amp; Dancers, Silvia Bennett/Gabor Csongradi/Emese Csornai, Jagoda Bobrowska and Svetlin Velchev, will show work in this new event at the end of May.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>This is where you come in!  Of course, creating this type of event takes funds and those are tight everywhere!  The money we are raising with this campaign is simply to pay the artists for their work.  These are professional choreographers and performers bringing their passion and talent to the community and they deserve to be compensated.  Our $2,000 goal will just barely cover small stipends, but the more you can give, ther more will go directly to these hard-working dancers and choreographers.  Even if we don't reach our entire goal, you can know that these artists are getting paid with whatever you are able to raise.  To sweeten the deal a bit, I've added some perks, like special insights on the choreographic process, free tickets to performances, dances choreographed and performed just for you and private yoga lessons!  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>We know that a monetary contribution is not possible for everyone.  But if you still want to help you can share this with everyone you know.  You can use the buttons on this page to share with your social networks.  You can tell people about it by email.  And most importantly, you can come to the show!  We do this to connect with you and seeing you at a performance is the best way to make that happen.  Details are below.</p>

<h3>My Story</h3>Summer ballet intensives are a critical part of my training as a serious ballet student. They allow me to have access to top teachers and facilities that my local studio cannot provide. They also allow me to focus completely on ballet training without interference from homework and school activities, which creates the ideal environment for me to greatly improve my dancing while I am there. Summer intensives are also expensive. I would love to go back to Miami City Ballet where I improved so much last summer but my family and I need some help to make it happen this year.<br/><br/>
</div><div>I have been saving every penny from cat sitting, Christmas money and the money my straight-A report cards bring in. With that money, the tuition cost is covered but my family and I are trying to raise the money for five weeks of housing and the round trip airfare. My overall goal is to raise 100 donations of 25 dollars. If you are able to help us out, a contribution of any amount will be greatly appreciated.<br/>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>In October of 2009 Christopher Skinner was mysteriously and brutally murdered in downtown Toronto. This horrific event brought homophobic violence into the headlines and out of the shadows galvanizing the Toronto queer community. Everyday queer students continue to contemplate their lives because they are faced with gay bashing at school. However, some people, queers themselves, believe our marginalized community has grown up and we are no longer living in terror. <br/></p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Due to the nature of the project the artists involved were required to be in rehearsal for 6 hours, 6 days a week for almost 6 months (spread throughout two years). The art came from their experiences being queer in the city and their full presence was required. However, we are a small and very young non-profit company and our financial resources are limited. As such, most of our money goes into covering rehearsal space and other small production costs. Our artists have yet to be compensated properly for their time, commitment and most importantly for their artistic contribution to this very personal story.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>As we move into our presentation at SummerWorks, our team is working hard to offset the production and marketing costs. This way, the revenue generated from the box office can allow us to properly pay our artists. This is where you come in. Your very generous contribution will go directly into covering our production costs. Once this is provided, and if we do surpass our $2000 goal, the funds will amount in generous and well deserved compensation for our artists. As a young company we rely on donations and box office revenue to make art. In other words, your contribution makes up 50% of our revenue sources and, as such, we consider you crucial to our play creation. No amount is too small. Please donate! <br/></p>

</div></div>","Our Story
In October of 2009 Christopher Skinner was mysteriously and brutally murdered in downtown Toronto. This horrific event brought homophobic violence into the headlines and out of the shadows galvanizing the Toronto queer community. Everyday queer students continue to contemplate their lives because they are faced with gay bashing at school. However, some people, queers themselves, believe our marginalized community has grown up and we are no longer living in terror. 
While our community has definitely evolved, lemonTree creations believes our fight is far from over.

<div>Aleksander is a dancer and an aspiring choreographer from Poland. This spring, he has been invited by Erica Sobol and collidEdance Company to visit Australia from mid-April to June, to take part in the ""collidEdance Intensive: Australia"", 6-weeks training dance program, as well as to perform in collidEdance shows in both Melbourne and Sydney. As CollidEdance's artists and Erica Sobol herself always have been the biggest Alek's inspiration, and their work is something he always looks up to, attending the Australian Intensive program would be a huge challenge, growth opportunity and a dream coming true for him.</div>
<div> </div>
<h2>
<br/>CollidEdance Intensive: Australia</h2>
<p>It is a 6-week long dance training program with Erica Sobol and collidEdance company member Morgan Burke. We intend to spend 3 weeks in Melbourne and 3 weeks in Sydney. Program involves training in conditioning and body awareness, stretching/strengthening, jazz and contemporary technique, partnering, and improvi<span class=""text_exposed_show"">sation. Combination classes will emphasize athleticism, musicality, and style. The intensive will include collidEdance repertory rehearsals as well as new work creation and will conclude with performances in both Melbourne and Sydney. The show, an evening of Erica's finest choreography, will be a celebration of the intensive's creative process, of the dancers' improvement in body and soul, and of the Australia art community. We will invite local musicians, photographers, fashionistas, creators-of-all-sorts to join us. It's goal is to offer the dancers a once-in-lifetime opportunity for challenge, triumph, growth, and learning in an intimate and supportive environmen.</span></p>
<h2><span class=""text_exposed_show""><br/>Meet Aleksander<br/></span></h2>
<p>Aleksander has got his very first opportunity of dance training at the age of 17 in Poland, where he is originally from. Ever since, he couldn't think of doing anything else. Dancing, choreographing and teaching shortly took over his entire life. For Alek, dance is all about story telling. His biggest inspiration comes from watching people, their stories, emotions, the way they approach and face life. Expressing feelings through movement and sharing it with other dancers in the studio is truly, his biggest passion. His movement is contemporary based, but he is constantly growing, taking from as many choreographers as possible, with a goal of becoming a versitale and a whole dancer, choreographer, artist, and human.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Reason</h2>
<p>In Poland, where Aleksander is from, the lack of a proffessional dance industry makes it nearly impossible to find sponsors willing to support a dancers' growth. Not being associated with any group or a dance company makes it even harder to get your training sponsored. Despite that, Aleksander is taking all the effort needed to gather enough funds and make it to Australia on time. Among other actions, he is currently putting together a fundraiser show in Poland. That's also why this campaign was created. Nevertheless, for now, Aleksander is not able to pay for both his travel and a 6-weeks living in Australia costs.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Goal</h2>
<p>The $1700 amount will completely cover the plane fare from Poland to Australia. Achieving the campaign goal will make it possible for Aleksander to be a part of the ""collidEdance Intensive: Australia"" training program which will be a once-in-a-lifetime event and experience.</p>

<p><span class=""notranslate""> </span></p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<div>
<p>Alongside being a dancer and a choreographer, Aleksander is a dance teacher. Being part of this experience will give him an amazing opportunity for growth and developement, not only as a dancer, but also as a teacher, an artist and a human being. Using this experience, he hopes to inspire his audience and dance students in both Europe and America more. He aims to spread both the dance art and the life knowledge earned during those 6 weeks in Australia. Among those, this event will help him develop his artistry and dance skills even more, give him another tool to express himself through the art of movement, which has been his biggest dream ever. Most importantly - after attending this program he will become a better qualified instructor and choreographer, which will result in giving his students a bigger challenge and pushing them to grow even more.</p>

<p>Short Summary</p>
<p>I, Pegah Tabassinejad, am a freelance director and choreographer. I completed a BA in Stage Directing at Tehran’s Art University. I also studied Contemporary Dance and Choreography in Paris at the Conservatoire de la Danse. I am currently researching about the ‘presence’ in theater with focusing on Gilles Deleuze and Gilbert Simondon as I complete my MFA in Interdisciplinary Art at Simon Fraser University. My main areas of interest are experimental theater and contemporary dance. I have directed several pieces, among them ‘Yerma,’ ‘A Doll’s Room,’ and ‘Fake Memories.’ I also created, directed and choreographed ‘Charisma,’ which has been performed in Tehran’s ‘Molavi Hall,’ ‘Dancing on the Edge Festival’ in Holland (a five city tour), and at ‘Push Off 2012’ in Vancouver.</p>
<p>How did the idea for this show come to me? It was a strange feeling, like a sudden storm coming on, a flood of disparate ideas and images, some of which were fairly transparent to me and some of which were rather opaque and mysterious and needed further teasing out. They were like charged particles that started hovering all around me and then colliding against one another with strange violence, and I knew that I needed to somehow rein it all in, to bring it all together into a kind of turbulent chorus--I knew that I could find some kind of deeper meaning there.  </p>
<p>Being from Iran, one of those ideas, perhaps inevitably, had to do with interiors--that is, with those places where we can isolate ourselves from the outside world and feel safe. What was interesting to me, however, was the idea that a person’s identity can still be shaped within her private realm by certain external forces, by (let us call them) windows through which she observes the world and through which she is also being observed (e.g., internet [skype, various social networks, shopping sites, etc.] and television).  What do we make then of a person’s identity? Is anyone unique? Or are we all just cogs in some great machine, carefully observed and controlled from a distance, merely a small part in a homogeneous mass? Or is there a way out?  </p>
<p>To explore some of these questions I decided to adapt Ibsen’s ‘A Doll’s House.’ The piece is not just a conventional staging of the play, but is a combination of theatre, performance art, and visual art. The show lasts fifty hours, with three set theatrical performances taking place between 8PM and 10PM on Oct. 19-21.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I have been working with a team of fifteen talented collaborators over the course of the past three months to bring this show to life. The show is conceptually complex and will require the use of various technological aids (surveillance cameras, projectors, laptops, and tv monitors). We are also building a mobile glass wall, which will not only serve as a set during the theatrical performance hours, but will be the central feature of an ongoing fifty-hour live installation (a combination of performance art, virtual performance, and visual installation) that will frame the scheduled performances. The cost of setting up such a show is high and since the project thus far has been self-funded we find ourselves in a difficult situation and in need of further funds. We need another $5,000 to properly support the team, secure the technical aids that will be necessary for the show, and complete the building of the set.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We believe that this project will be a unique and thought-provoking inquiry into the nature of various forms of surveillance and its effects on our lives. It deals with the shifting nature of public and private life and questions our ideas about the relationships we form through Internet protocol services such as Skype. I explored this idea in a durational piece last April. I brought together actors from all corners of the world via Skype. They performed from their houses and communicated with their partners virtually in the performance space. The performance (which, in a way, was a small-scale test for the current show) was very well received by the public. According to a written survey we conducted with audience members as they left the performance space, they found the piece stimulating and provoking. Our goal with the new piece is to more fully explore these complex issues and create a challenging work. Your contribution would be greatly appreciated! </p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p><br/> I am Cuauhtemoc Peranda, MFA, and a choreographer and dancer based in the Bay Area. I am putting on a dance concert at La Peña on Nov. 4th, with some other amazing dance artists, and we need funds to help make this production a reality.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Boy Who Fell From The Sky</strong><br/>  <em>….a gift from above, a sentiment for creation….</em><br/>  <em>The Boy Who Fell From The Sky</em> is a collection of small dances set in a large performance event, Mitote. Each dance follows the themes of “struggle, rebirth, and creation,” setting a certain tone of “hope and possibility” for the night of dancing. The inspiration for this concert comes from the Iroquois creation myth of how the earth came into being: “A sky woman falls down, into a world made of water and sky, and upon a turtle’s back she rubs earth and clay, and there the land, the earth was made”. Yet, in the fashion of Mitote, Cuauhtemoc Peranda decided to change the story and make the one who falls from the sky not a woman, not a man, but a boy—full of innocence, magic, and wonder. In following his Aztec name, Cuauhtemoc, meaning “Descending Eagle &amp; The Messenger of The Gods to The People”, he is creating a world of imagination and necessary messages of self-creation and community renewal. And, with works from guest artists Jochelle Pereña, Kristin Torok, and Elizabeth Morales, this performance event, Mitote, creates a mythic space for inspiring creation in all those who are present. A dynamic night of contemporary dance<em>, The Boy Who Fell From The Sky</em> is not a performance to be missed!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><br/><strong>This is an important campaign because without funds, dances like this cannot happen.  Dances cannot become possible. This Dance Company and concert is about healing, and creativity. We practice in the Native American, Modern, and LGBT dance forms, often unseen, and rarely seen together.  </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This dance concert will reach a great many populations: The General Dance Community, Berkeley, Oakland, San Francisco Art Lovers, The LGBTQ peoples, Native Peoples, LA RAZA, and the future of dance and arts. Moreover, as concerts are made by Cuauhtemoc Peranda Mitote, the company is empowered to teach more about Mitote, and eventually tour the world--sharing our art with those who need it, and making our communities known and realized as actual people. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>The Funds will go to: ARTIST FEES, RENTAL OF VENUE, COSTUMES, TRANSPORATION, MARKETING, MUSICAL SCORES, AND LIGHTING OF THE DANCES. Dancers should be paid for their work, and a stipend can only be given if there are funds. Of course there are regular fees for a dance, and most money/ticket sales go to the House/venue-- so in order for an artist to actually be paid for their work, we need your donations. </p>
<p>As a perk, you can come to our open rehearsals, and at the event come backstage and share a special moment with the artists. Come and meet us after our work, and get to know our process and why we make dance!!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Funds are needed to realize the actualization of this event, or it cannot happen.  We do not end with the artists performing, but Mitote is spread to the spectator, all their individual worlds, and into the worlds and communities we all inhabit.  Any contribution helps to fuel the power of Cuauhtemoc Peranda Mitote and achieve the goal of this performance. Already, previous works by choreographer Cuauhtemoc Peranda have been recognized, and awarded, as culturally recognizant, respective, and explorative of multiple communities and their identities.  This event is the latest in the strong headway Cuauhtemoc Peranda and these artists are making.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>All performance takes time and energy!  If you or someone you know can contribute costuming materials or construction skills, marketing or print design and supplies, or any other possibly helpful contributions of time, materials, special skills, etc., please let Cuauhtemoc know! And of course, please tell your friends, family, and all your circles of the event, share it on Facebook or whatever social network you're a part of, and absolutely, COME SEE THE ARTISTS!!!</p></div>","Short Summary

The Boy Who Fell From The Sky  ….a gift from above, a sentiment for creation….  The Boy Who Fell From The Sky is a collection of small dances set in a large performance event, Mitote. Each dance follows the themes of “struggle, rebirth, and creation,” setting a certain tone of “hope and possibility” for the night of dancing. The inspiration for this concert comes from the Iroquois creation myth of how the earth came into being: “A sky woman falls down, into a world made of water and sky, and upon a turtle’s back she rubs earth and clay, and there the land, the earth was made”. Yet, in the fashion of Mitote, Cuauhtemoc Peranda decided to change the story and make the one who falls from the sky not a woman, not a man, but a boy—full of innocence, magic, and wonder. In following his Aztec name, Cuauhtemoc, meaning “Descending Eagle & The Messenger of The Gods to The People”, he is creating a world of imagination and necessary messages of self-creation and community renewal. And, with works from guest artists Jochelle Pereña, Kristin Torok, and Elizabeth Morales, this performance event, Mitote, creates a mythic space for inspiring creation in all those who are present. A dynamic night of contemporary dance, The Boy Who Fell From The Sky is not a performance to be missed!
 
This is an important campaign because without funds, dances like this cannot happen.  Dances cannot become possible. This Dance Company and concert is about healing, and creativity. We practice in the Native American, Modern, and LGBT dance forms, often unseen, and rarely seen together.  
 
This dance concert will reach a great many populations: The General Dance Community, Berkeley, Oakland, San Francisco Art Lovers, The LGBTQ peoples, Native Peoples, LA RAZA, and the future of dance and arts. Moreover, as concerts are made by Cuauhtemoc Peranda Mitote, the company is empowered to teach more about Mitote, and eventually tour the world--sharing our art with those who need it, and making our communities known and realized as actual people. 
 
What We Need & What You Get
The Funds will go to: ARTIST FEES, RENTAL OF VENUE, COSTUMES, TRANSPORATION, MARKETING, MUSICAL SCORES, AND LIGHTING OF THE DANCES. Dancers should be paid for their work, and a stipend can only be given if there are funds. Of course there are regular fees for a dance, and most money/ticket sales go to the House/venue-- so in order for an artist to actually be paid for their work, we need your donations. 
As a perk, you can come to our open rehearsals, and at the event come backstage and share a special moment with the artists. Come and meet us after our work, and get to know our process and why we make dance!!
 
The Impact
Funds are needed to realize the actualization of this event, or it cannot happen.  We do not end with the artists performing, but Mitote is spread to the spectator, all their individual worlds, and into the worlds and communities we all inhabit.  Any contribution helps to fuel the power of Cuauhtemoc Peranda Mitote and achieve the goal of this performance. Already, previous works by choreographer Cuauhtemoc Peranda have been recognized, and awarded, as culturally recognizant, respective, and explorative of multiple communities and their identities.  This event is the latest in the strong headway Cuauhtemoc Peranda and these artists are making.
 
Other Ways You Can Help
All performance takes time and energy!  If you or someone you know can contribute costuming materials or construction skills, marketing or print design and supplies, or any other possibly helpful contributions of time, materials, special skills, etc., please let Cuauhtemoc know! And of course, please tell your friends, family, and all your circles of the event, share it on Facebook or whatever social network you're a part of, and absolutely, COME SEE THE ARTISTS!!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>1.  A sensational dramatic story with exaggerated characters and exciting events that will appeal to the emotions.</p>
<h3>Help Sitka, Alaska revitalize Community Theater through a historical, campy melodrama<em>, Paris of the Pacific.  </em>
</h3>
<p>This request is from the Greater Sitka Arts Council that originated in 1973 and was known for its excellent Community Theater. However over time it waned and then was dormant until 2008. Now Sitka is revitalizing the Community Theater and hopes to stage an audience participation melodrama.</p>
<p> Sitka, population less than 9,000, is a small island community in Southeast Alaska. Now known as the most historic city in Alaska, Sitka served as the Russian capital of Alaska.  In fact the sale of Alaska from Russia to the United States took place in Sitka in 1867.  At that time, Sitka was known as the Paris of the Pacific due to its rich culture and arts.</p>
<p>Three main threads weave together Sitka’s culture, the Tlingit Native Alaskans who have inhabited the area for over 10,000 years, the Russians who landed in 1799 seeking sea otters for trade, and Americans from the United States following the purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867.  All three groups are ready to share the stage in <em>Paris of the Pacific</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Why a melodrama? </strong>Alaskan, especiallySoutheast Alaskan, history is full of colorful and quirky characters.  What better way to share our rich history than with community melodramas, something Southeast Alaska is known for.  Ketchikan has been offering the same locally written melodrama, <em>Fish Pirates Daughter</em>, for almost thirty years. Its popularity has become almost cult like with impromptu audience participation. It’s still fun for the local audience and for the tourist audience as well.  Juneau had the  <em>Hoochinoo and Hotcakes</em> melodrama also locally written, Skagway offers the <em>Soapy Smith Revue</em>, Haines had <em>Lust for Dust</em> also locally written, and just across the border in Whitehorse, British Columbia has the <em>Gaslight Follies</em>, and Dawson has Diamond Tooth Gertie’s that offers a melodrama.  All these melodramas are based on a smidgen of historical truth with lots of fun stirred in.</p>
<p>Our melodrama, aptly titled, <em>Paris of the Pacific</em>, is also locally written and is about the exchange when the US bought the Alaska territory from Russia in 1867. The Greater Sitka Arts Council has been working for the past several years getting the play written and fine-tuned.  Now, 146 years after The Transfer, we are ready to start production for a 2013 season having our first opening during the Alaska Day Festival that Sitka celebrates every year in October.  Alaska Day is an official state holiday held on October 18 each year. It commemorates the formal transfer of Alaska from Russia to the United States. It might be official statewide but Sitka is the only town that closes the schools and banks and has a parade in the rain. We hold an Alaska Day Ball with period costumes and the Army Big Band comes down for the party from Fairbanks. It is a weeklong event full of fun, music, art, and soon, with your help, a melodrama.</p>

<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">How You Can Help</h1>
<p>  </p>
<p>  We are working hard and doing our best to save as much money as possible for this trip. But financial help is needed with expenses.</p>
<p>Here are the details:</p>
<p><i><b>1. Roundtrip Flights</b></i>  (LAX – Madrid) - $992/per person </p>
<p>$992 x 5 people = <b>$4,960</b></p>
<p><i><b>2. RNFE </b></i>(high speed train roundtrip to Granada) - 120 EUR per person</p>
<p>120 Eruo x 5 people =<strong> 600 EUR</strong></p>
<p><i><b>3. Accommodations </b></i>(2 weeks) - 100 EUR per night </p>
<p>100 Euro x 14 =<strong> 1,400 EUR </strong></p>
<p><em>*** This would be an apartment which allows us to cook at home and will cut down on dining out costs!</em></p>
<p><i><b>4. Class Fees </b></i>(Carmen de las Cuevas)<strong> -</strong> 300 EUR per person/per week</p>
<p>300 EUR x 5 x 2 weeks =<strong> 3,000 EUR</strong> </p>
<p><strong></strong> </p>
<h4 style=""text-align: center;"">TOTAL: $4,960 + $6,754 (5,000 EUR) = $11,714.00</h4>
<p><strong><em></em></strong> Please keep in mind Indiegogo charges a 9.0% fee on the funds we raise. If we reach our goal, we get 5.0% back, <strong>for an overall fee of 4.0%</strong></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">which leaves us with $12,090.</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What You Get!</h2>
<p>  For your generous contributions, besides our DEEPEST GRATITUDE, you will receive some of the following perks!!</p>
<p>  Post mailed signed thank you card, signed flyers, brand new 2014 ""Noche de Flamenco"" signed posters, and a DVD from a future ""Noche de Flamenco"" concert!!</p>
<p>  Also available are TWO - SIX comp tickets to a future ""Noche de Flamenco"" show of your choosing, private lessons with Pamela Lourant and private flamenco performances for you and your guests with the entire flamenco company!!<br/></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The Impact!</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Out of the thousands of flamenco dancers that have taken classes for years in Santa Barbara, sadly very few have traveled to Spain. The dedicated dancers that have are now professionals  working all over California, the United States and the world.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em>**There has never been an organized trip like this before with up and coming artists in all of Santa Barbara! This would be a first! And from this, hopefully more dancers will see that it is possible to travel to Spain and continue their flamenco education.</em></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""> </h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Our Plans After We Return</h2>
<h3></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Children's Creative Project of Santa Barbara</p>
<p> Recently the company was selected to become part of the Children’s Creative Project of Santa Barbara! Since 1974 the CCP, a non-profit education program provides quality arts experiences for elementary and secondary school students in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo County! During school assemblies we will give Flamenco “demonstrations” which means explaining the history of flamenco and Spainish culture accompanied with dance segments. They'll get a history lesson and an exciting show all at the same time! </p>
<p>  This provides an opportunity for Sangre Nueva and I to give back to the community and inspire the next generation of young dancers! WE ARE THRILLED!!</p>
<p> In 2014 ""Noche de Flamenco"" will begin its second season of authentic flamenco productions all over California! We are driven and filled with excitement to bring a  revamped concert series to audiences!!</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""> </h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">If We Don’t Reach Our Goal…</h2>
<p>Depending on the amount we raise, we will try our best to combine all fundraising efforts from Indiegogo, private shows, teaching classes and personal savings in order to get to Spain!  If we still do not have enough for all 5 people, I will take as many people as I can in order to learn choreographies and come back and teach them to th rest of the company. It is a trip of a lifetime and an experience we won’t forget! Spain is our goal. I want the best for my company and for the ‘<b>Noche de Flamenco’</b> concert series for the 2014 season! We strive for the best, and the best of the is in Spain!</p>

 With your contribution, you can give these up and coming young artists an opportunity of a lifetime!!

 
What We Need & 
How You Can Help
  
  We are working hard and doing our best to save as much money as possible for this trip. But financial help is needed with expenses.
Here are the details:
1. Roundtrip Flights  (LAX – Madrid) - $992/per person 
$992 x 5 people = $4,960
2. RNFE (high speed train roundtrip to Granada) - 120 EUR per person
120 Eruo x 5 people = 600 EUR
3. Accommodations (2 weeks) - 100 EUR per night 
100 Euro x 14 = 1,400 EUR 
*** This would be an apartment which allows us to cook at home and will cut down on dining out costs!
4. Class Fees (Carmen de las Cuevas) - 300 EUR per person/per week
300 EUR x 5 x 2 weeks = 3,000 EUR 
 
TOTAL: $4,960 + $6,754 (5,000 EUR) = $11,714.00
 Please keep in mind Indiegogo charges a 9.0% fee on the funds we raise. If we reach our goal, we get 5.0% back, for an overall fee of 4.0%
which leaves us with $12,090.
 
 
What You Get!
  For your generous contributions, besides our DEEPEST GRATITUDE, you will receive some of the following perks!!
  Post mailed signed thank you card, signed flyers, brand new 2014 ""Noche de Flamenco"" signed posters, and a DVD from a future ""Noche de Flamenco"" concert!!
  Also available are TWO - SIX comp tickets to a future ""Noche de Flamenco"" show of your choosing, private lessons with Pamela Lourant and private flamenco performances for you and your guests with the entire flamenco company!!
The Impact!
Out of the thousands of flamenco dancers that have taken classes for years in Santa Barbara, sadly very few have traveled to Spain. The dedicated dancers that have are now professionals  working all over California, the United States and the world.  
**There has never been an organized trip like this before with up and coming artists in all of Santa Barbara! This would be a first! And from this, hopefully more dancers will see that it is possible to travel to Spain and continue their flamenco education.
 
Our Plans After We Return

Children's Creative Project of Santa Barbara
 Recently the company was selected to become part of the Children’s Creative Project of Santa Barbara! Since 1974 the CCP, a non-profit education program provides quality arts experiences for elementary and secondary school students in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo County! During school assemblies we will give Flamenco “demonstrations” which means explaining the history of flamenco and Spainish culture accompanied with dance segments. They'll get a history lesson and an exciting show all at the same time! 
  This provides an opportunity for Sangre Nueva and I to give back to the community and inspire the next generation of young dancers! WE ARE THRILLED!!
 In 2014 ""Noche de Flamenco"" will begin its second season of authentic flamenco productions all over California! We are driven and filled with excitement to bring a  revamped concert series to audiences!!
 
If We Don’t Reach Our Goal…
Depending on the amount we raise, we will try our best to combine all fundraising efforts from Indiegogo, private shows, teaching classes and personal savings in order to get to Spain!  If we still do not have enough for all 5 people, I will take as many people as I can in order to learn choreographies and come back and teach them to th rest of the company. It is a trip of a lifetime and an experience we won’t forget! Spain is our goal. I want the best for my company and for the ‘Noche de Flamenco’ concert series for the 2014 season! We strive for the best, and the best of the is in Spain!

It's a spirit that stands alone in its
simplicity. An elixir carefully crafted to be sweet and smoky within the same

<p>What makes a classic good? A story that withstands the tests
of time - that stands alone in its universality. Engaging characters that you love
and hate sometimes within the same breath. An experience that delights and is
different for each audience member. Something to be shared, savored, and served
simply…on the rocks.</p>
<p>At <i>Classics on the Rocks</i> we believe that classical theatre
is special.  The words, the language, and characters have lasted centuries, and for a good reason. While you may not
always be able to put your finger on what makes it a classic (like a fine
dram of whiskey) you just know that on some level it resonates within you as though it was made just for you. </p>
<p>As storytellers, our goal is to share the story with you, and to do so as simply as possible. We focus on the words and characters eliminating fluff, filler, or
exotic concepts. Through our live stage productions and class
workshops we strive to explore the classics with you in a fun, engaging, and
interactive way.  It’s classical theatre
you can understand. It’s classics served simply…on the rocks. </p>
<p><i>Classics on the Rocks</i> launched successfully in 2013 with a
dream and mission – to share our love for classical theatre, romantic language,
quirky ingénues, and crazy clowns with the masses. We found a receptive audience here in NYC in our inaugural year, in which we self-produced two staged readings in our signature no-frills fashion with great success. Having spent much time refining our company’s mission and goals we are now ready and excited to take the next step forward to producing a fully staged production of <b><i>As You Like It</i> in July 2014</b> - and we need your help!<br/></p>
<p>Being an independent theatre company in New York, offers all sorts of challenges ranging from finding ways to stand out and attract an audience to finding a performance space that offers the proper atmosphere. And naturally, this all comes with a price - even the most modest of performance and rehearsal spaces cost upwards of $3,000. </p><p><b>This is why we need your support.</b> All donations will go directly towards our production of <i>As You Like It</i> - rehearsal and performance space, costumes, and prop pieces.

We at Chaspen Foundation for the Arts (ChaspenArts.org) are committed to helping them get it! A mere $600 would cover a mid-range iPad. Should we fail to raise the whole amount, all proceeds raised would still go to LAB, as a grant earmarked toward the purchase of a tablet. All proceeds in excess of $600 will go toward a second grant, to help fund LAB's ""A Chance to Dance"" for the 2013-14 season.What is ""A Chance to Dance?""One Sunday each month during every season, the dancers of Los Angeles Ballet offer monthly FREE ballet, jazz, hip-hop, alternative dance/fitness classes, and lectures/demonstrations for all ages. Healthy beverages and snacks are provided free of charge by local businesses. Daycare is also FREE, with art materials provided by Blick Art Room Aid, to enable parents who wish to take the classes. For over 8 years, LAB sought to establish ""A Chance to Dance,"" finally proceeding with the program last year - UNFUNDED - to serve low-income children, families, seniors, and veterans. Founded and helmed by Los Angeles Ballet Principal Ballerina Allynne Noelle and supported whole-heartedly by the dancers of LAB, the community outreach initiative began last year at the Los Angeles Ballet Center in West LA, with nearly 200 people of all ages accessing the monthly free classes. This year, on a shoestring budget, LAB expanded the program into Hope Street Family Center in South-Central LA.Classes at both locations encompass Creative Movement for Ages 3-6, Pilates Mat Class (all ages), Introduction to Ballet (all ages), Mommy & Me (infant-2), Adult Beginning Ballet, Adult Advanced Ballet, Kids/Teen Master Class (7-13), Horton Technique, Jazz, Hip-hop, Caribbean Dance, Yoga, Hula Hoop, and more. LAB dancers participating in the program have included Principal Dancers Allynne Noelle, Allyssa Bross, Christopher Revels; Soloists Chelsea Paige Johnston, Alex Castillo, Bianca Bulle, Julia Cinquemani; and most of LAB's Company Dancers, as well as LAB Physical Therapist Susanne Thom. In order to coordinate the expansion of classes with additional teachers and a vast influx of students in two locations, the program desperately needs an iPad for the Chance to Dance Associate Administrator.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm Anita Riggio, Book Writer, Lyricist and Producer of <em>BRINDLEBEAST</em>, and building this musical has been my passion, my pleasure, and my work for six years. Since 2010,<b> we have successfully raised $90,000</b> through Kickstarter and direct contributions. These funds have allowed my collaborator, composer Sila Shaman and me to come to this campaign with a completed <strong>script </strong>and<strong> score</strong>, a <strong>Broadway cast</strong> of actors who are as committed to this project as they are talented, and an <strong>award-winning director </strong>and<strong> choreographer</strong> who are keenly interested in bringing <em>BRINDLEBEAST</em> to life in an excting <strong>new theatre space</strong>--plus <i>BRINDLEBEAST</i> has just been honored with the 2013 <b>Martha Hill Newell Playwright's Award</b>. <em>GREAT NEWS!!<b> </b></em>But before we get to a staged reading, before we get to a fully realized production, we need funds to meet specific goals--and THAT's where YOU come in.</p>

I'm Anita Riggio, Book Writer, Lyricist and Producer of BRINDLEBEAST, and building this musical has been my passion, my pleasure, and my work for six years. Since 2010, we have successfully raised $90,000 through Kickstarter and direct contributions. These funds have allowed my collaborator, composer Sila Shaman and me to come to this campaign with a completed script and score, a Broadway cast of actors who are as committed to this project as they are talented, and an award-winning director and choreographer who are keenly interested in bringing BRINDLEBEAST to life in an excting new theatre space--plus BRINDLEBEAST has just been honored with the 2013 Martha Hill Newell Playwright's Award. GREAT NEWS!! But before we get to a staged reading, before we get to a fully realized production, we need funds to meet specific goals--and THAT's where YOU come in.


The Current Need
Check out the side bar for the low down on what you'd get for your contribution. Meantime, here's what we need:

$5,000 to pay for the ASL translations of the script and songs
$6,500 to pay for travel and housing expenses 
$12,000 to pay ASL interpreters and coaches during a 60 hour workshop
$25,000 for development




Um...but that's a pile o' cash, isn't it?
Sure. $48,500 is a pile o' cash. But we're mounting one campaign that would carry us through the development process of the next year and a half--and to our world premiere. If we reach our goal, this campaign will fund three phases of development:
Phase #1 would be the ASL translations of the script and songs, ASL tutoring for our five hearing actors, and ASL interpreting for our two deaf actors. 
Phase #2 would be travel, housing, and development for a workshop or lab. 
Phase #3 would be development for a fully staged reading. 
Makes sense, doesn't it?


 
The Project
BRINDLEBEAST braids together three story strands: a love story between a hearing man and a Deaf woman; a story of confronting a personal beast; a chronicle of the creative process itself. 
The world of BRINDLEBEAST is inherently inclusive: it is multi-racial, Deaf and hearing, straight and gay. The quest of the protagonist in BRINDLEBEAST is everyone’s quest: to confront one’s inner beast in order to love and be loved.  
I hope audience members will recognize themselves and their own struggles in these characters, and that after seeing BRINDLEBEAST, will return to their lives a bit more tolerant, a bit more accepting, a bit more loving of themselves and others.

 companies. The touring schedule is backed up by an educational outreach
 programme. The workshops are targeted at a cross-section of the

 improvisation.  They form the backbone of the company’s desire to bring
 theatre to groups who might not otherwise realise the relevance it can 
have to their lives. We hope to take our work to India, to where the story of Bobbie started; raising awareness of Alzhiemers and growing old to broad range of people and increasing participation in the Arts.<br/></p>

Vancouver is currently ranked as the hate crime capital of Canada, which is horrifying, especially given our supposed liberal-mindedness on the West Coast. As a result, the timing for MY FUNNY VALENTINE couldn't be better - it is a means to start a conversation. The play examines hate within a community and its implications, something we need to shed light on right here at home.

Typically a theatrical run in Vancouver for small independent companies is 1-1.5 weeks. Zee Zee is launching this vital production with performances starting April 14, and we are hoping to continue the run through the month as there are so many people who need to see this production. This is where the real conversation happens. 

What We Need & What You Get

Dinner and Sex Upstairs will run for two weeks in April 2014 in Manhattan. In 2013, the company produced Last Man Out at Theater for the New City; it hopes to replicate that success in a smaller, more intimate venue with Dinner and Sex Upstairs. The Dotted Elk is currently reviewing New York City theatres to determine a space that will best fit our production's unique recipe.

<p>“Ford shines in his own work. He nails a broad spectrum of comedy, leaping in and out of multiple characters in seconds, managing to make them all sympathetic but skewering all of them for their weaknesses—including the occasionally frightened and self-entitled coconut. El Ultimo Coconut feels a little rough-hewn in spots (it is an extension of a student project, after all) but is consistently entertaining and even shows glimmers of brilliance.” –The Stranger</p>
<p>“Ford’s work is well written and was executed with bold energy. Three seconds in and I wanted to hug him. SO ADORKABLE! …. If you ever tried to go against the grain of your heritage because the deep longing in your heart wouldn’t settle for anything else – you will relate. If you ever renounced your family, your past, your skin, your roots to save your own ass (or face) – you will relate to this show. Good art is like that… and ‘Coco’ is beautiful like that.” –Theater &amp; Its Trouble</p>
<p>“[Ford's] fish-out-of-water antics and double-takes provide many of the laughs, which burble forth throughout, but the howls of laughter come from his mom’s demand, when she has something weighty to say, that Coco sit in his chair. Without going into it, the chair has a way of symbolizing the way moms the world over fight the future in which their children have grown…. The strength of the show lies in how packed it is with candid observations of daily life for a Mexican-American family living in Arizona, and the multitude of borders jammed into a single living room.” –The Sunbreak</p>

<p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p>Please help me launch my High School Theatre Operations Consulting
company.</p>
<p>My name is Beth Rand and I am launching my business: Rand
Consulting and Design (RCD).  My
Associate Consultants and I provide services for safe, functional,
self-sustaining, and empowering learning environments in high school theatres.</p>
<p>These days many high schools are building state-of-the-art theatres, and
a lot of these double as educational facilities and “road houses”.  After the theatres are built the keys are
handed over to school administrators and teachers who are not trained to manage
theatres and to teach students technical theatre.  I am launching this business to fill this gap.</p>
<p>RCD’s purpose is to
help high schools get their theatres up and running; set up operating systems,
scheduling, create a safety program, and work with the staff and students to
provide a functional, safe, and educational environment.</p>
<p>We are those rare Theatre Consultants who are actively
working in the high school theatre environment, giving us first hand knowledge
about current operational issues.  I
myself began my technical theatre career in my own high school theatre.  I have worked in educational and professional
technical theatre for over 30 years, and I have worked in over 20 theatres.  My primary background is in Stage Lighting,
and more recently Theatre Management.</p>
<p>This campaign is to pay for the costs of running a booth at the
CEFPI Annual Conference in Portland in October 2014.  </p>
<p>CEFPI (Council of
Educational Facility Planners International) is a worldwide non-profit
association whose mission is to improve the places where children learn.  CEFPI members are involved in planning,
designing, building, equipping and maintaining school facilities such as
theatres.</p>
<p>CEFPI is one of the
primary organizations with whom I expect to be working in order to achieve my
goals of making high school theatres more functional, safe and educational.  </p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Many people have performed in a theatre at least once
during their high school days.  Many
people have children who have performed in a school theatre. Many people have a
high school in their community with some sort of performing arts program.  When we go to events in school theatres, we
as audience members just see the magic. 
We don’t see what goes on to create this magic.  And, unfortunately, we are not aware of how
mismanaged or how unsafe it can be behind the scenes.</p>
<p>It’s my purpose, through my business’s services - and also
through “<i>The</i> High School THEATRE
OPERATIONS MANUAL”, which will be published soon - to help high schools
positively answer these questions:</p>
<p>Is the staff comfortable and knowledgeable about the theatre’s
functional operation?</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Is learning enhanced through the theatre operations?</span><br/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Is the theatre ergonomically functional?</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Are operational policies and procedures in place?</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Is the theatre self-sustaining financially?</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Is the school protected from liabilities and lawsuits?</span></p><p>
Is the theatre being used to its full potential?</p>
<p>A functional, safe and educational theatre can have an
impact on student learning, facility operations and overall safety.</p>
<p><b>What We Need </b></p>
<p>The cost of having a booth at the
CEFPI conference includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<p>$1250  Booth
fee </p>
<p>$445  Booth
furnishings (chairs, carpeting, electric. not included) (estimated)</p>
<p>$2160    4 nights hotel for myself and 2 of
my Associate Consultants (3 rooms)</p>
<p>$600  Booth
signage, supplies (estimated)</p>
<p>$925  Conference
fee for 1 Associate Consultant (conference fees for 2 people included in booth
price)</p>
<p>$200  Gas
to and from Portland (estimated for 2 cars)</p>
<p>$720  Meals
– 3 people, 4 days, 3 meals (estimated)</p>
<p>$1200  Stipend
for 2 Associate Consultants to help staff the booth for 3 days</p>
<p>$300  Cost
of 6 (2 per person) company shirts to wear at the conference</p>
<p><u>$200</u>  Certificate
of Insurance (required)</p>
<p>$8000</p>
<p><b>Partial Funding</b></p>
<p>If the entire goal is not reached, here’s what will
happen:</p>
<p>1.  If not enough
money is raised to have a booth at the conference, I will attend the CEFPI conference
by myself for networking and marketing opportunities, and any remaining funds
will be applied to other start-up and marketing costs of the business.</p>
<p>2.  If not enough
money is raised for me to attend the conference at all, the funds will be
applied to other start-up and marketing costs of the business.  </p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>Any donation amount would really be appreciated. </p>
<p>Also really appreciated would be help in getting the word
out about my campaign.  Please help me
spread the word to your friends, family and colleagues through word of mouth, Facebook
and other social media, and by forwarding this page link in your e-mails.  </p>
<p>Thanks for believing in my cause and for supporting my
campaign!</p>

We are those rare Theatre Consultants who are actively
working in the high school theatre environment, giving us first hand knowledge
about current operational issues.  I
myself began my technical theatre career in my own high school theatre.  I have worked in educational and professional
technical theatre for over 30 years, and I have worked in over 20 theatres.  My primary background is in Stage Lighting,
and more recently Theatre Management.
This campaign is to pay for the costs of running a booth at the
CEFPI Annual Conference in Portland in October 2014.  
CEFPI (Council of
Educational Facility Planners International) is a worldwide non-profit
association whose mission is to improve the places where children learn.  CEFPI members are involved in planning,
designing, building, equipping and maintaining school facilities such as
theatres.
CEFPI is one of the
primary organizations with whom I expect to be working in order to achieve my
goals of making high school theatres more functional, safe and educational.  
The Impact
Many people have performed in a theatre at least once
during their high school days.  Many
people have children who have performed in a school theatre. Many people have a
high school in their community with some sort of performing arts program.  When we go to events in school theatres, we
as audience members just see the magic. 
We don’t see what goes on to create this magic.  And, unfortunately, we are not aware of how
mismanaged or how unsafe it can be behind the scenes.
It’s my purpose, through my business’s services - and also
through “The High School THEATRE
OPERATIONS MANUAL”, which will be published soon - to help high schools
positively answer these questions:
Is the staff comfortable and knowledgeable about the theatre’s
functional operation?Is learning enhanced through the theatre operations?Is the theatre ergonomically functional?Are operational policies and procedures in place?Is the theatre self-sustaining financially?Is the school protected from liabilities and lawsuits?
Is the theatre being used to its full potential?
A functional, safe and educational theatre can have an
impact on student learning, facility operations and overall safety.
What We Need 
The cost of having a booth at the
CEFPI conference includes, but is not limited to:
$1250  Booth
fee 
$445  Booth
furnishings (chairs, carpeting, electric. not included) (estimated)
$2160    4 nights hotel for myself and 2 of
my Associate Consultants (3 rooms)
$600  Booth
signage, supplies (estimated)
$925  Conference
fee for 1 Associate Consultant (conference fees for 2 people included in booth
price)
$200  Gas
to and from Portland (estimated for 2 cars)
$720  Meals
– 3 people, 4 days, 3 meals (estimated)
$1200  Stipend
for 2 Associate Consultants to help staff the booth for 3 days
$300  Cost
of 6 (2 per person) company shirts to wear at the conference
$200  Certificate
of Insurance (required)
$8000
Partial Funding
If the entire goal is not reached, here’s what will
happen:
1.  If not enough
money is raised to have a booth at the conference, I will attend the CEFPI conference
by myself for networking and marketing opportunities, and any remaining funds
will be applied to other start-up and marketing costs of the business.
2.  If not enough
money is raised for me to attend the conference at all, the funds will be
applied to other start-up and marketing costs of the business.  
Other Ways You Can Help

<p>Shakespeare up close and personal.  We want to bring the incandescent splendor of
the language of (in the view of many) Shakespeare’s greatest play.  <i>Shakespeare’s
</i><i>Antony and Cleopatra</i><i>:
UNDONE</i> offers a brisk, seventy-minute thrill ride of passion, power
plays, deception, and death on an intimate storefront stage in Chicago. To be produced Sept 5 - Oct 5 2014.<br/></p>
<p>We (Patricia Henritze – director/writer and Shawna Tucker
– actress/writer) came together to collaborate on a piece that had fascinated
us.  Why does Shakespeare’s version
receive relatively few productions? And
why, over the years, have so many actresses and actors failed at this play?  We wanted to create a version of the play
that would be easier to produce by smaller companies – those with the passion
for Shakespeare, but not the budget. 
This scaled-back adaptation will allow for greater flexibility in staging and artistic interpretation, leading to greater accessibility for one of the Bard's greatest works.  Both Patricia and Shawna have been involved in theater as actors, playwrights,
producers, and directors for over 25 years. 
We’ve worked in Chicago, St. Louis, Atlanta, Washington D.C., and New
York.  We bring mature experience to a
mature play.</p>
<p>This will be the inaugural production of Skyline
StageWorks, a company to create an organic engagement with audiences by actors
and playwrights, to bind them together with an experience that will touch the
mind and heart in a meaningful way.  
Getting started is always the tricky part, and we’re inviting people
from the Chicago area (and beyond) to be part of something unusual – and to
help collaborate with a genius… Shakespeare!</p>
<p>Three
quarters of the $4000 we hope to gather from this fundraising effort will go toward
space rental, the rest will go toward artist fees.<span>  Our artists are graciously agreeing to
contribute their services for far less than they deserve, and we will use box
office receipts to add to their compensation, in addition to pay for building
materials, props and costumes.</span></p><p><span>We have not yet received not-for-profit status, so unfortunately, contributions are not tax-deductible.  You'll be giving out of pure love for the art, and you will be heartily thanked for it!<br/></span></p>
<p>W.H.
Auden described <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>
as Shakespeare’s greatest play.<span>  That it
isn’t performed more often, and the beautiful language isn’t aired more
frequently is mostly due to difficulties in producing such an epic play.  (Forty-four characters!)  With the creation of our piece, we will have
something that can be produced at all levels: 
college, community theater, storefront theater, professional and non
professional.  The lushness of the
language will be <i>heard.</i></span></p>
<p>ANY
contribution, large or small will be of help.<span> 
This includes monetary contributions, contributions by sharing our story
and our link, and if you are in the Chicago area… come to the play!!!</span></p>

<h3>What Are We Doing?</h3>
<p>My lovely artist friend, Laurie Zabele Cawley, shot me a message one day and asked if I'd like to collaborate on a split bill concert with her at Union College in November. I was BLOWN AWAY. I was being asked to work with one of my favorites and the next best part? I didn't have to pay through the nose to do this.

</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We've put a lot of our own money into this process already, but I'd love to actually give these women something more for their time. <i>Did I mention I have been feeding them an absurd amount of M&amp;Ms and Swedish Fish?</i></p>
<p>Here's where the money will go:</p>
<ul>
<li>$1,000 will go to pay the dancers. They really deserve it.</li>
<li>$200 will go to the composer of <i>5+1</i>, Kyle Sorensen<br/>
</li>
<li>$200 will go to the car we're renting to drive up to Schenectady, NY and back. <br/>
</li>
<li>$200 will clothe them. This is an all-ages show, so we'll need costumes.</li>
<li>$200 will cover the rest of the space rentals. <br/>
</li>
<li>$200 will feed the company on our trip.</li>
</ul>
<p>Like I said, we've already put a lot of time and money into this project so far, but we need help. And if you bust out your calculator, you'll notice the amounts above surpass our $1,500 mark. Making work and showing the world isn't cheap, but we do it everyday. And we'll keep doing it tomorrow. <br/></p>
<p>Aside from the immense satisfaction of supporting the arts, you can select from an array of perks based on your tax-deductible donation. <i>Wait, what?</i> <i><b>Tax-deductible?</b></i> <b>YES!</b> As a sponsored artist of Fractured Atlas, any amount you donate is tax-deductible by the furthest extent of the law. </p>
<p><b>What happens if we don't reach our goal?</b> Easy. Any amount we do raise will go straight to the dancers and collaborating artists. None of this work could happen without them, and they deserve the best! <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>Low on cash? We get it. But there are other ways you can contribute if you're interested in helping us reach our goal. Here are a few ways:<br/><ul>
<li>Share our campaign with your friends!</li>
<li>Use the easy links on Indiegogo to spread the love to Facebook, Twitter, and beyond!</li>
<li>Send us good vibes!</li>
<li>Show your love of art by taking your friends and family to a show, and come see us when we're in your 'hood!</li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Lastly</b>, as director of this company, I do everything I can to support my amazing
 artists. <i>But sadly, there aren't enough M&amp;Ms and Swedish Fish in 
the world to give these women what they deserve for their time and

 I'm asking you if you wouldn't mind helping me out. <b>Thank you</b> for your time, and <i><b>dance on, lovers!</b></i><br/></p>

</div></div>","What Are We Doing?
My lovely artist friend, Laurie Zabele Cawley, shot me a message one day and asked if I'd like to collaborate on a split bill concert with her at Union College in November. I was BLOWN AWAY. I was being asked to work with one of my favorites and the next best part? I didn't have to pay through the nose to do this. After receiving a grant from Dance Alliance and working with Union College's Theatre and Dance Department, we're putting on a FREE show open to everyone in the community. 
We are working to bring more art awareness and modern dance to the community that already houses some pretty incredible programs through Union College and The National Museum of Dance.

<h4><i>Plot</i></h4>
<div>Randle P. McMurphy is a brawler, found guilty of gambling and rape, who contrives to serve a short sentence in an airy mental institution rather than in a prison. This, he learns, is a mistake. He clashes with the head nurse, a fierce martinet.

He leads others out of introversion, stages a revolt so that they can see the world series on television, and arranges a rollicking midnight party with liquor and chippies. For the first offenses, the head nurse has him submit to shock treatment. For the Party, to horrid for her, she forces him to submit to final correction of frontal lobotomy.</div>

<p>Hi, I'm Gabe Milligan-Green and I am putting together a theater piece that is called Chaos Theory as Taught by an Aboriginal Male.  At its most basic level, this piece is about a man who has become trapped in his own head, and in trying to find a way out only delves further into his subconscious.</p>
<p>This piece began as an experiement in creating theater from a purely imigistic standpoint.  I had these images in my head, specific events and pictures that I felt would be compelling and interesting to stage and to watch.  And the question I had for myself was, when putting together these vibrant, but incongruous, events what sort of narrative would emerge?  In creating a piece of theater without starting some grand message or purpose at its core, what would it end up saying?  And in the process of developing it something definitely began to unfold from it.  One of the ideas that has grown from it has been the clash between two these two worlds: reality against the subconcious, the literal colliding with the absurd.  And how do they come to terms with each other?</p>
<p>In creating this world in the mind, or worlds really, we use a lot of costume and prop pieces.  It's about creating rules and then suddenly breaking them.  Nothing ever stays stable, it is always constantly shifting, and in order to do that we use a lot of devices in the show.</p>
<h2>Your Donations:</h2>
<p>The donations that we receive from you are going directly into funding the show.  The money will go towards purchasing a number props and items that have had to be tracked down, as well as towards costumes and other set items that we have had to build and create, as well as advertising for the show.</p>
<h2>Can't Help Monetarily?  You Can Still Help!</h2>

Hi, I'm Gabe Milligan-Green and I am putting together a theater piece that is called Chaos Theory as Taught by an Aboriginal Male.  At its most basic level, this piece is about a man who has become trapped in his own head, and in trying to find a way out only delves further into his subconscious.
This piece began as an experiement in creating theater from a purely imigistic standpoint.  I had these images in my head, specific events and pictures that I felt would be compelling and interesting to stage and to watch.  And the question I had for myself was, when putting together these vibrant, but incongruous, events what sort of narrative would emerge?  In creating a piece of theater without starting some grand message or purpose at its core, what would it end up saying?  And in the process of developing it something definitely began to unfold from it.  One of the ideas that has grown from it has been the clash between two these two worlds: reality against the subconcious, the literal colliding with the absurd.  And how do they come to terms with each other?
In creating this world in the mind, or worlds really, we use a lot of costume and prop pieces.  It's about creating rules and then suddenly breaking them.  Nothing ever stays stable, it is always constantly shifting, and in order to do that we use a lot of devices in the show.
Your Donations:
The donations that we receive from you are going directly into funding the show.  The money will go towards purchasing a number props and items that have had to be tracked down, as well as towards costumes and other set items that we have had to build and create, as well as advertising for the show.
Can't Help Monetarily?  You Can Still Help!
And if you can't help by donating money, that's alright, you can help in other ways too! Spread the link around to some other people you know that may be interested and generous, and if you're in New York or have friends here, spread the word about the show!  Come out and see what it becomes!  Having people in the seats is ultimately what we want the most.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Our mission and structure</strong></p>
<p>We are committed to researching, examining, and embodying the political and economic history of the United States in the last 100 years. We take continual inspiration from Marguerite Young's life work <em>Harp Song for a Radical,</em> dedicated to early 20th century labor activist Eugene Debs. We know that to know history is already to embody it. We rehearse and work rigorously in our struggle to understand more. We want to provide an understanding of our history by way of performance that is empowering, that is entertaining, that is precise, and that is living. We will create original work with original voices in a diverse, multi-generational community. </p>
<p><strong>Our history</strong></p>
<p>Harp Song for a Radical was originally conceived as an academic project completed by participants in the University of Washington's B.A. and MFA programs in Drama Performance, Production, and Design, with assistance from the History department. After a 6-month workshop period, the Harp Song ensemble presented this first version at the Meany Studio Theater in October 2011. Small segments were later performed at the Seattle Labor Temple Association and the Voices of Occupy stage at the Folklife Festival in 2012.</p>
<p>Harp Song reorganized itself following the Folklife festival with a new concept and time period. It was performed as a twelve-minute vignette in March 2013 as part of the regular Twelve Minutes Max festival organized by On the Boards in preparation for its later expansion at the upcoming Northwest New Works festival in June 2013.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What We Are Asking For</strong></h2>
<p><strong>We are asking for $5,500 from whoever can contribute even one. </strong></p>
<p>We are raising this money to fund our Northwest New Works production.  We have pared down all our costs to the bare minimum, and receive some in-kind support from the University of Washington school of Drama. However, we want to also provide the professional artists involved with a stipend to compensate them for their time; each of the ensemble has made very real fiscal sacrifices by taking time off work or from other projects. Additionally, we would like to provide each of the designers with a modest budget so that they have as many options as possible for attaining their vision. If we are unable to achieve our goal in fundraising, we pledge modify our project to the resources we have received from you.</p>
<p><strong>Our Goal</strong></p>
<p><strong>Collaboration, Education, Opportunity</strong></p>
<p>Harp Song for a Radical has always been a collaborative project. In the first iteration teachers worked closely with their students to discover and refine techniques of devising historically based theater. Now, the ensemble has expanded into an even split between students, recent graduates, and professionals. It is our goal to remain a project based company following this next production and to continuously provide the opportunity for young artists to work with established artists towards the greater goal of refining strategies to create new and exciting work. </p>

<p><strong>Who? </strong></p>
<p>We are the ACT ensemble</p>
<p>Anna-Helena, Chris-Gerard, Danny, Rudy, George, Ragnhild and Sean</p>
<p>an ensemble of actors, musicians, movers and shakers who have been working on our distinct approach to making theatre for between 2 and 10 years, each of us at slightly different stages of our journey with it.

<p><strong>What? </strong></p>
<p>We are ready to make the leap to commit ourselves fully to our shared work, become a collective and realise our first production STORM combining our ACT training with topics and texts that move us and the communities we want to support in a big way. Communities particularly associated with Youth work, International Exchange, Disabilities in the arts, Collaborating with freeing the voice of women in Palestine with music, Sustainability in arts and Education for social change. However our company live between New Delhi, Los Angeles, Warsaw and London and our work base is in Kent and it is proving insurmountable to cover the costs of our travel to work together in the way we need for this particular project, at this moment. Our passion to make theatre together, though, is unstoppable and we have faith that together we can make some thing that's never been seen before.</p>
<p>Recent feedback after three of us worked just 4 days on a demonstration in USA follows:</p>
<p><em>""It was a great honor to see the work in progress showing of Moon Fool's Storm... Rarely are we graced with such skilled performers and creators of new work that is equally dedicated to the text, the body, the voice and the music. I wish to applaud them for their ambition in covering so much material and fearlessly presenting it.

<p><strong> STORM </strong></p>
<p>We see STORM as something fresh, magic and powerful and that will go far beyond us and our limitations. Practically speaking, we envisage that four key actors will lead audiences on a promenade performance into a theatrical world designed by Paddy Molloy, where they will share in the company's fantastical powers of physicality and music, following a story about building life on a new found island and enquiring about the nature of our changing climate. It is a piece that through exchange and collaboration we wish to open to inclusive and variegated audiences in UK and abroad. We will devise our story through improvisation and in collaboration with Sean's choir Gre Badanie and with several key researchers.</p>

<h3>FRIENDS, THESPIANS, COUNTRYPEOPLE, LEND ME YOUR CASH!</h3>
<p>And story does need to be told. Here. Now. At this time. In this city. We need to keep telling women’s stories and raising women’s voices.</p>
<p>I know what you’re thinking… is this play going to topple the patriarchy? Is this a revolutionary piece of dramatic political theatre that will change the cultural zeitgeist forevermore?</p>
<p>Well, um….no.</p>
<p>Other than the fact that women are speaking and being... like… people. Which, unfortunately is still an act of rebellion in some circles- or at the very least an act of annoyance, but at the risk of being interrupted by John McCain I’ll move on…</p>
<p><i>Or,</i> tells the story of one fictional night in the life of real-life 17th century playwright Aphra Behn. She was a playwright, a spy, a lover, a widow, a traitor, a patriot, and SO MANY OTHER THINGS. LIKE ALL WOMEN. We are not just one thing. In a time when society seems more obsessed with putting us in boxes than ever, this play explores the depth and breadth of what we can be. Who we can be. How many different people we can love in an infinite number of ways.</p>
<p>The play is set at the beginning of the restoration after a long period of darkness, war, and Puritanical values. The theaters are about to re-open for the first time in over a decade, women are onstage for the first time ever, playing both male and female parts, and hope and change are in the air. Sound familiar? This play premiered at the beginning of Obama-era America, but don’t we need a story like this now more than ever?</p>
<p>Also it’s funny, and don’t you need a laugh right now?</p>
<h3><strong>FRINGE IS BETTER TOGETHER!</strong></h3>
<p>Maiden Phoenix Theatre Company and Simple Machine are two Boston fringe theatre companies committed to bringing art to a wider community. OUR POWERS COMBINED… we bring you: <i>Or,</i> by Liz Duffy Adams. Making art in the Boston Fringe has always been a labor of love, and sometimes you need a little help from your friends.</p>
<p>Since 2013 MPTC has been committed to telling stories about women: past, present, and future and Simple Machine believes character, language, and action are the essential elements at the heart of all theatre. By focusing on these fundamentals, Simple Machine makes theatre that is engaging, accessible, and affordable.</p>
<p><i>Or,</i> explores the spectrum of what women can be: Tease or traitor, hero or harlot, or all of the above? And asks the question, to quote Sondheim, ""Is it always 'or' is it never 'and'?""  Although most people who know the play think of it as a story about England’s first published female playwright, when we meet Aphra she is far from her goal of being a famous playwright. She has to fight tooth-and-nail to get out of the dangerous spy trade once and for all and to re-invent herself as a poet for the ages. Or, shows us a woman on the brink of change who is willing to do whatever it takes to step into her new life.</p>
<p>This campaign will help us continue our commitment to paying our artists a fair stipend, and in this production we will be working in a brand new theatre space. The issue of available and affordable space in the Boston theater scene has been an important one since our inception. Most of our budget will go toward space requirements and we are thrilled to be serving a new community in Chelsea, MA and bringing women's stories to a wider audience.</p>
<h3>FRINGE AIN’T ABOUT THE MONEY… BUT WE DO NEED SOME…. PLZ?</h3>
<p>Our total budget for the project is $7,900 and we are trying to raise $5000.  But we’ve already raised $2900!</p>
<p>Due to the success of our <i>Pants Role Nation</i> fundraiser we have already raised $1900 dollars!! (Ladies! Pants! Vegetables! Guess you kinda had to be there) and due to the continued support of The Bob Jolly Charitable Trust we have received another $1000 dollars to put towards this production.</p>
<p>Our main cost is the space at Chelsea Theatre Works (The BRAND SPANKING NEW BLACK BOX THEATRE!) that we will use for rehearsals and performances for $3550.</p>
<p>Our Staff costs are $1450 for our professional Designers, Actors, and Staff.</p>
<p>Design Budgets for Set, Costumes, Props, Lighting, and Sound equal $1200</p>
<p>Publicity will be $400 (because we gotta get people there or really… what are we doing?)</p>
<p>Show rights total (yay, paying playwrights!) is $900</p>
<p>Insurance (no fun, but necessary, since being sued is even less fun) is $400</p>
<p>We have wiggle room of $200 for unexpected costs (there’s always something) for a total of: $7900</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In these troubled economic times, it is the fringe and small theaters that need your financial support more than ever. We don’t have a subscriber base or generations of donors to fall back on. All we have is our belief in this story and the support of people who want to take a leap of faith. Despite all the challenges, we are coming together to do what needs to be done in order to share this story with an audience. We believe in its power to move, entertain, challenge, shock, and re-contextualize the past and present. Above all, we believe in the hope and freedom of expression that this story champions, especially in these times of political and artistic crisis.</p>

<li>
<a href=""https://leebergerprocess.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Lee Berger</strong></a> is a theatre-maker/producer from South Jersey, but calls Brooklyn his home now. He received both a BFA in Acting and BA in Philosophy and Religious Studies from Pace University, and has found that his devised theatre is the best way of combining both of his passions.</li>
<li>
<strong>Frie(dman) Berger</strong> has been in the works, at least on paper, since 2010 when my mother was diagnosed with <a href=""http://webgny.alsa.org/site/TR?px=5037288&amp;fr_id=12682&amp;pg=personal"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>ALS</i></a> (Lou Gehrig's disease), beginning as a collection of poems, and becoming the massive movement piece/exploration it now is, with terrific influence from, theater-makers past and present, as well as my production team <a href=""http://www.chadchenail.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Chad Chenail</strong></a> and <a href=""https://www.thefleetnyc.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Ellen Maynard</strong></a>, the piece has finally found its legs in the language of dance and movement, all that my mother lacked during her time sick.</li>
<li>When our goal is reached, we will be able to raise awareness of ALS through the little used conduit of art, and not just tell the story of my mother, but also share stories together, hope together, laugh together, cry together, and together ask the question: Are we enough?

<li>$500 to pay the director, $500 to pay the choreographer, $200 for each of the actors (4 - 6, $800-$1200), $500 for food during the 1 week intensive/workshop/incubator period (November 5th- November 10th), $250 for accommodations/venue (only such a great price because the owner is a friend), $400 travel expenses (moving 7 - 9 people from NYC to Parksville, NY), $250 (set/props/costumes), $275 for indiegogo fees.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>We aren't here just for my cathartic experience though, please don't misconstrue this piece for something selfish, patronizing, or  pretentious. I want everyone to feel like the experience was shared. At the end of the show, people will feel connected, to me and each other, because we will all have shared something unique together, and participated in something deep and felt. It will be an exploration into the depths of human emotion, NOT just mine but those of everyone's present. We will have laughed and cried, and even danced like no one was watching. And we will have asked whether it was all enough or not, whether we were enough or not, if we are enough or not?</li></ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>We are doing it all very fast; the magic (good or evil...) of the process. This piece is about connecting, and asking if we are enough for the loved ones in our lives or ourselves. It's about knowing how we all ask ourselves this everyday, and that that's what brings us together. I have chosen to work on a very quick timeline to emulate the speed of a show for an audience. We will be work intimately still to keep the closeness intact. We will be working for 9 hours a day for 6 days devising the one-hour work whose backbone/spine currently exists as a 26 page script. But how can we write what the audience has yet to write? How do we write our improvised response to that audience? The script shapes itself around discussion questions and jumping off points about our saddest and happiest moments of life; love, loss, grief, joy, humiliation, fulfillment, and micro-love, a concept introduced in the play. The hurdles mostly lie in balancing the tight timeline and still being able to put something together that is audience-ready without sacrificing the art. But deadlines create urgency, and urgency drives passion.</li>
<li>Working with these  tight sort of timelines, however, became, not only part of my wheelhouse, but almost my specialty in grad school. Almost exclusively working in this fashion allowed us to keep the ideas from going stale or flat. </li>
<li>Often times artists don't know when the piece is finished, when to say ""enough."" Ours will be finished in 6 days!</li>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>My name is <strong>Caroline Nash</strong> and I set up <strong>Next Page Productions</strong> in <strong>Northampton</strong> to enable new writing to be produced and performed around The Midlands, England.</p>
<p><strong>Firstly - the non- exciting bit:</strong></p>
<p>We present high quality new writing and are pleased to have nurtured relationships with writers with strong credentials and innovative ideas.</p>
<p>We strive to attract first time theatre goers and  those who may be new to writing, by promoting our work widely as well as engaging with writing organisations and more traditional theatre audiences. </p>
<p>We want our audiences to be able to explore the truths of constructed storytelling, that doesn’t have to lead them to a decisive ending. The talents of East and West Midlands based artists must be witnessed and we want you to be a part of it.</p>
<p>By making a contribution, you will enable us to get the show to production state. We will do our utmost to take it forward from there to even bigger and better things.</p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>What We Need:</strong></p>
<p>And now for the fun stuff.</p>
<p>Your support will enable us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>contribute something towards a Director for a rehearsal period - she has already agreed to waive her fee as a support to the cause, because she is a very good egg</li>
<li>contribute a fee to 2 actors for the roles of Sid and Joan for a rehearsal period -  so they can at least afford to eat and keep their strength up</li>
<li>contribute to a fee for a Stage Manager as they actually hold the entire thing together and it would be impossible without them</li>
<li>create marketing material - well how else will you know where we are ?</li>
<li>support the cost of props and costume - we aren't pretty when we're naked</li>
<li>ensure a professional production that is ready to tour on a profit share basis</li>
<li>support the venue cost for the first 2 nights of production to be presented locally - we will personally pay for all other venues</li>
<li>cover the cost of a rehearsal space so that we don't all REALLY annoy our significant others by rehearsing in front of the tv.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you cannot donate at this time, please do come along to our performances.</p>
<p>Check out the tour dates as soon as they are published at <a href=""http://www.nextpageproductions.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.nextpageproductions.co.uk</a></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Caroline Nash has produced 4 successful tours to date. Please check out her website for Next Page Productions at <a href=""http://www.nextpageproductions.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.nextpageproductions.co.uk</a></p>
<p>Each tour has brought something a little new and a little different to the theatre world and she hopes to continue to bring this new work to life for as long as she possibly can.</p>
<p>Steve Dimmer presents society talks on the Carry On films called 'Ooh Matron !' and these are extremely popular. It has demonstrated the fondness that people have for these wonderful characters and also the passion that Steve Dimmer, the writer, has for these people. But what about behind the screen ? What were they really like?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you like the sound of the show and you aren't in a position to be able to contribute, then there are lots of other ways that you can help.</p>
<ul>
<li>Share the 'Sid &amp; Joan' out of the link for this crowdfunding - not just once, but lots of times.</li>
<li>Tell your friends, especially those that have an interest in theatre, new writing and British Legends. You could just be sharing it with the one person that is looking to support us.</li>
<li>Use the Indiegogo free share stuff and help us get this show on the road.</li>
<li>If you want to volunteer your time to help in any way, let us know and we will see which of your many skills we can utilise.</li>
</ul>
<p>In advance, Steve and Caroline would like to take this opportunity to thank you for whatever you can help us with, in order to make this dream a reality.</p>

<h3>Me:</h3>
<p>My name is Sarah Robertson. I am an actor, dancer, choreographer and rapper!  I have recently completed a 4 year dance program and now (almost) a 4 year acting program!  I'm almost there!</p>
<h3>My Project:</h3>
<p>In order to graduate, I need to produce my own show and I need some support to do it! </p>
<p>I am doing a show that involves 3 fantastic professional directors (Graham Percy, Kris Marushy &amp; Andrew Legg).  As I move forward in my acting career it is so beneficial to have worked with such stellar directors and to learn more acting styles in the process.  This project, most importantly, allows me to<strong> graduate</strong>.  Secondly, it sets me up for <strong>more success in my future acting career</strong>!</p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get:</h3>
<p>But it's not cheap having these professionals on board!  <u>We need $950 for:</u></p>

<li>A mask workshop with Graham Percy</li>
<li>Transportation for all my directors (all over Southern Alberta)</li>
<li>Licensing &amp; Production Costs</li>

<h3>What It Means To Me:</h3>
<p>I would be so grateful for your support as I do my last hurrah (this show) after four long, hard (and amazing!) years of acting school.  I have felt so much support and would love to share this project, this show, and my acting work with all of you.</p>
<p>This show is also an expression of how important I believe it is to try and fail and experiment in life.  With choices, with dreams, with communication, with EVERYTHING!  I am learning to let go and make more mistakes and fail more, which is why I've chosen to do an experimental project. </p>
<p>I think it will be FUN, I think it will be HILARIOUS, and I think it will INSPIRE others to think outside the box more and try and fail more in life, so we can learn.</p>
<p>Thanks for considering supporting this wacky, experimental and ultimately, GRADUATION project!</p>

</div></div>","Me:
My name is Sarah Robertson. I am an actor, dancer, choreographer and rapper!  I have recently completed a 4 year dance program and now (almost) a 4 year acting program!  I'm almost there!
My Project:
In order to graduate, I need to produce my own show and I need some support to do it! 
I am doing a show that involves 3 fantastic professional directors (Graham Percy, Kris Marushy & Andrew Legg).  As I move forward in my acting career it is so beneficial to have worked with such stellar directors and to learn more acting styles in the process.  This project, most importantly, allows me to graduate.  Secondly, it sets me up for more success in my future acting career!
What I Need & What You Get:
But it's not cheap having these professionals on board!  We need $950 for:

A mask workshop with Graham Percy
Transportation for all my directors (all over Southern Alberta)
Licensing & Production Costs
Marketing
Refreshments for after the show


Perks include:

Tickets to see the show
Personalized Raps

<p>     We are Invictus Theatre, a new nonprofit theatre company focusing on heightened language in Chicago. We believe in the power of language to express the nuances of the human condition. We believe language empowers our communities to share their stories, create connections, and tear down barriers based on race, religion, gender, or sexual orientation. </p>
<p>    In the fall/winter of 2017 we will produce our first full length production of William Shakespeare's Othello: The Moor of Venice. A play still relevant 400 years after its inception; dealing with issues of race, gender, identity, and discernment of the truth.</p>
<p>      100% of the funds we raise from this campaign will go towards our rental fees for performance and rental space. Even if we don't reach our goal, your contribution will aid us in putting Othello onstage (literally!).</p>
<p>       At Invictus Theatre, we believe that mastery over language connects our communities. Participating in language-based theatre such as Shakespeare's Othello either as an actor or an audience  member invites us to share our stories and our experiences. It gives words to the wordless, and makes what is within, without. </p>
<p>    Please help us bring Othello from the page to the stage. Invictus Theatre is a 501 c(3) non-profit theatre company so all donations are 100% tax deductible. Even if you are unable to make a financial contribution there are other ways you can help, either by in-kind donations, volunteering, or passing along our campaign to your friends on Facebook!</p>

<h3> </h3>
<p>My name is Teddy Fatscher and I am a local Philadelphia Choreographer and Creator. I moved to Philadelphia in 2010 to further my dance studies at the University of The Arts from which I now possess a BFA in Modern Dance Performance and Choreography. Throughout my career I have been blessed with the opportunity of working with and learning from choreographers such as Brian Sanders, Roni Koresh and Moses Pendelton. I started Matter Movement Group in 2018 to not only create an outlet for my creative energy but also to provide a platform for other artists to share their artistry and creativity with a receptive community. This years project ""HABIT@"" is a vision that is going to require hundreds of hours of creation, fabrication, choreography, rehearsal and building. These are the reasons why this campaign is integral in MMG creating the vision of ""HABIT@"" to the fullest. I would be a fool to say I could do this all myself which is why I am asking you, my friends and family, to help today in achieving our goal. This set alone will be unlike anything we have ever constructed before. It will display all four seasons and geography spanning from the barren deserts to the deepest depths of the ocean. The choreography work has already begun. It draws inspiration from the most profound plant and animal life that exist all over the world. </p>
<p>Last year was extremely challenging for me. I had recently left my job and was transitioning into another. I wasn't financially stable enough to take on the task of creating an entire Fringe Festival production...but I had to. It was something that seemed like a no brainer to me. I was so blinded by my goal I literally spent my last dollar on the production of ""UNHINGED"". It was a real eye-opener to how committed I actually was to this project and this aspect of my life. I can promise you, as contributors, will see a repeat of last years commitment, if not more.</p>
<p>We at MMG are setting a fundraising goal of $10,000. This amount of money would allow MMG to compensate performers a livable wage for their hours of creation and rehearsing this project. It will also allow MMG to purchase building materials necessary in constructing the immersive set that we envision. Our costumes will transform human bodies into flora and fauna animated by the performers themselves. With that being said, it is defintely going to be expensive. You can give what you can or claim one of our amazing perks to get more from us in return from your contribution.  If you can't contribute, we at MMG understand and hope that you will share this with friends and family who are advocates for the arts. We also hope you come experience the production as a patron. Trust us, you do NOT want to miss this.</p>

<h3>Help us Breath Life into the Words of the Black Panther Party</h3>
<ul>
<li>Iron Age Theatre has been producing theatre focused on the common man and justice for almost 30 year and Theatre in the X has been making theatre available to the common man in underserved communities for the past five years. Iron Age's diverse approach to theatrical work has offered opportunities for progressive stories to be shared with audiences to shake their preconceptions. Theatre in the X brings African American theatre with new and veteran Philadelphia talent to West Philly in Parks for free. Both groups share a common vision of working with under appreciated actors, playwrights an communities. The production is directed by Eric Carter, Walter DeShields, and John Doyle and will feature Philadelphia Actors.</li>
<li>The Black Panthers have been presented by the media as violent extremists and by history as a lost movement with little lasting impact. Truly, this could not be farther from the truth.  We need the voices of the panthers to help us more forward in these challenging times. The Panthers ideals, and their efforts to build community support must be reexamined. The call for observation and participation can only work if people are able to observe the actions of the panthers and this production allows people to feel the emotion behind the lives and missions of panthers at the ground level.</li>
<li>Today as people struggle to find ways to protest, looking at the lives not of the leaders of the party but the ground soldiers can offer examples that contemporary citizens can observe and include in their efforts to better our nation and our world.</li>
<li>This is about making great art, engaging people in social change and action. We want to provide local performers  the opportunity to present great stories to our community and to engage in a conversation about the powerful ideas and the personal stories of the Panthers. We want to build community by connecting like-minded artists in a creative process about real people.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need to pay actors, directors, designers and rent some space for the production. We need support to help advertise the show to assure people know and engage in the production. The production is only a few nights but we want to fairly compensate the team. We hope to include two musical performances and so will need funding to compensate the musicians and to assure the sound quality is excellent. We have chosen to present the show in a community theatre building rather than a big Philly theatre and so are pushing the funding back into underserved communities. Your donations will all go right into the production allowing more words to be heard.</li>
<li>Our perks are all representative of the panthers. Buttons, stickers and tickets to the performances. We want people to hear the ideas, and put them into practice and our perks help people do that as well as allow you to show your panther pride or believe in the power of the people.</li>
<li>We will find a way to make this event happen. We will drive the money we gather into the event whether we reach our goal or not.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our world and our nation is becoming steadily less humane and more corporate. Iron Age and Theatre in the X want to change the world and getting these ideas out can make a difference set by step.</li>
<li>Iron Age has been challenging the community with progressive ideas for year. We just completed an acclaimed run of a new one man show about Black Panther Fred Hampton which will begin touring the country in April. We have produced productions like this, Voices of a People's History, bringing a more diverse cast to the stage focused on progressive literature and speeches from history as curated by Howard Zinn and Anthony Arnove. We have brought walking tours of local communities populated with actors presenting African American stories on Juneteenth in association with the NAACP.</li>
<li>Theatre in the X has been making theatre in Malcolm X Park for four years, Theatre in the X uses well established and novice playwrights and actors to perform FREE theatre in the black community in West Philly. They are developing new work all of the time.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is the first collaboration between Theatre in the X and Iron Age and we are learning to work together.</p>
<ul><li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">One of our biggest challenges is </span>recruiting<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> actors for a single </span>performance<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">.

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you can't donate....Please help us get the word out. Tell people about the production and about the possibility of donating. You can make our work possible by helping people find this campaign. Observation and Participation.</li>
<li>Indiegogo has many tools which with you can share this project and PLEASE DO!!!!</li>
<li>And COME TO THE SHOW in February!!!</li>

We hope to include two musical performances and so will need funding to compensate the musicians and to assure the sound quality is excellent. We have chosen to present the show in a community theatre building rather than a big Philly theatre and so are pushing the funding back into underserved communities. Your donations will all go right into the production allowing more words to be heard.
Our perks are all representative of the panthers. Buttons, stickers and tickets to the performances. We want people to hear the ideas, and put them into practice and our perks help people do that as well as allow you to show your panther pride or believe in the power of the people.
We will find a way to make this event happen. We will drive the money we gather into the event whether we reach our goal or not.


The Impact

Our world and our nation is becoming steadily less humane and more corporate. Iron Age and Theatre in the X want to change the world and getting these ideas out can make a difference set by step.
Iron Age has been challenging the community with progressive ideas for year. We just completed an acclaimed run of a new one man show about Black Panther Fred Hampton which will begin touring the country in April. We have produced productions like this, Voices of a People's History, bringing a more diverse cast to the stage focused on progressive literature and speeches from history as curated by Howard Zinn and Anthony Arnove. We have brought walking tours of local communities populated with actors presenting African American stories on Juneteenth in association with the NAACP.
Theatre in the X has been making theatre in Malcolm X Park for four years, Theatre in the X uses well established and novice playwrights and actors to perform FREE theatre in the black community in West Philly. They are developing new work all of the time.


Risks & Challenges
This is the first collaboration between Theatre in the X and Iron Age and we are learning to work together.

One of our biggest challenges is recruiting actors for a single performance. We have done this effectively in the past over and over.
