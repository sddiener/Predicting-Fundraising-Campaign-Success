<p class=""western"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><strong style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">We are working on it</strong></p>
<p class=""western"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Some projects are the pioneers of the Science and Technology to change the societies and the World to the better. As Bealdin project is. We are working on the permanent, flexible Bealdin semantic infrastructure as a part of semantic web to integrate human presence in it. We aim to develop the next generation Internet which will recognize you as a unique anonymous person to personalize your short and long term expectations.</span></p>
<h2 class=""western""><strong>Who we are</strong></h2>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">My name is Atilla Coskun, the founder and the leader of Bealdin project. Since the beginning, Bealdin Project had been found very interesting by scientists, experts, developers and ordinary users. It took time to bring different disciplines of Science and Technology together. At this moment, more than 40 universities, organizations, software companies of the Europe and the World have come together in Bealdin Initiative, awaiting to take role in Bealdin Project Development in different stages. So, we are Bealdin Project Office, performing Coordination&amp;Organization activities with a small team. That's why we are here asking for your contribution.</p>
<h2><strong><span style="""">How we will do it</span></strong></h2>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><span style="""">Currently, Internet is made for human to read, understand, interpret and use. For example, actually, your computer, even this server publishing this web page; cannot understand what is written here and what is its use for. </span></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><span style="""">Semantic web, enables machine to read, understand, interpret and process the information on Internet. Problem is, there is not any initiative yet to enable machine to understand, interpret and process the data about human. Except Bealdin Project.</span></p>
<h2 class=""western""><strong><span style=""background-color: transparent; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"">Internet Will recognize you as a unique personality</span></strong></h2>
<p><span style=""""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">As soon as Bealdin is ready to serve, you will be recognizable by machine, applications, services on the Internet through your anonymous, Descriptive Personal Data with Bealdin Assistance. It means that, machine will be aware of your likes, dislikes, wishes, demands, desires and interests to personalize the Internet for you, instead of your manual efforts.</span></span></p>

<h2><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><strong>Türkiye'nin Desteği</strong><br/></span></h2>
<p>Biz; Bealdin Projesinin kurucuları ve tasarımcıları; biz bu ülkenin yurttaşlarıyız. Biz; Zengin ve kadim Anadolu kültürünün mirasçıları; göle maya çalmaya kalkan; Aşk için dağlarin delinebileceğine inanan insanların torunlarıyız. Bealdin'i ilk kez hayal ettiğimizde, bu işin nasıl para kazanabileceğini bile düşünmeden, “hadi yapalım” diyebilmemize; bir ileri bir geri, cebimizdeki parayı son kuruşa kadar harcayabilmemize; yıllar boyunca, özel hayatımızı, uykularımızı ideallerimiz uğruna heba edebilmemize sebep olan şey; bize dedelerimizden kalan, “Kafaya koyduğu şey için sonuna kadar uğraşı verme” inadıdır.</p>
<p>İçinde bulunduğumuz durumda onlara; göle nasıl maya çalınabileceğini, dağların nasıl delinebileceğini, Bealdin'in nasıl yapılabileceğini anlatabildiğimiz içindir ki; Avrupa'nin ve Dünya'nın, konusunda saygın ve uzman Üniversitelerinin, Organizasyonlarının, yazılım ekiplerinin Bealdin Projesine tam desteğini alabildik. Eğer başarılı olamasaydık, her Anadolu insanının yapacağı gibi “Canımız sağolsun” der yolumuza devam ederdik. Başarılı olabildiğimiz ve proje partnerlerimizden Bilim-Teknoloji-Ekip desteği alabildiğimiz için buradayız ve hala çalışıyoruz.</p>
<p>İşte tam simdi, sizlerin, Türkiye'nin desteğini umuyor ve bekliyoruz. Sizin bu kampanyaya vereceğiniz destek, diğer ülke insanlarının vereceği destekler için teşvik ve ülkemizin Bealdin Projesine gösterdiği desteğe kanıt olacaktır.<span> <br/></span></p>

<h2>Çalışmaya devam ediyoruz</h2>
<p>Bazı projeler, toplumları ve Dünya'yı daha iyiye doğru değiştirebilmek için Bilim ve Teknolojiye öncülük ederler. Bealdin Projesinin yaptığı gibi. Üzerinde çalıştığımız projenin amacı; kalıcı, farklı teknolojilere göre yeniden biçimlendirilebilir, anlamsal (semantic) bir yazılım mimarisi içerisine, bir birey olarak insanı eklemlemek. Bu sayede, Bealdin asistanlığında, Internet'in sizi özel bir kişi olarak tanıyabilmesini ve hizmetlerini size göre kişselleştirmesini sağlayacağız.</p>
<h2>Biz Kimiz</h2>
<p>Ben Atilla Coşkun, Bealdin projesinin kurucusu ve Lideriyim. İlk günden itibaren, Bealdin fikri, bilim insanları, uzmanlar, ve sıradan Internet kullanıcıları için çok ilginç olarak değerlendirilmişti. Ancak, bilim ve teknolojiyi ayni potada eritip, Bealdin Internet Cininin nasıl yapılabileceğini gösterebilmek yıllrımızı aldı. Şu anda, Bealdin Insiyatifi çerçevesinde, 40 ın üzerinde Üniversite, organizasyon, yazılım ekibi, Bealdin projesinin farklı aşamalarının uygulanmasında rol almak için bizim seçim yapmamızı bekliyorlar. Biz, Bealdin Proje Ofisi olarak, Bealdin Projesinin Organizasyon ve Koordinasyon işlerini yürütüyoruz. Sizden destek istememizin nedeni, üstlendiğimiz bu görevi daha iyi yapabilmemiz ile ilgili.</p>
<h2>Nasıl yapmayı planlıyoruz</h2>
<p>Şu anda kullandığınız Internet, insanların okuyup anlaması, yorumlayıp kullanması için yapılmıştır. Örneğin, şu anda bu yazıyı okuduğunuz bilgisayar; hatta bu yazıyı yayınlayan sunucu, burada ne yazdığını ve yazılanların ne işe yaradığının farkında bile değil.</p>
<p>Semantik Web, yeni bir teknoloji olarak, bilgisayarların (makinaların) Internet üzerindeki bilgileri okuyup anlamalarını, yorumlayıp insanların yararına işleyebilmelerini sağlar. Buna rağmen, makinaların, Internet kullanıcıları ile ilgili verileri okuyup, yorumlayıp, kişiler yararına kullanmalarını sağlayabilecek bir proje, bir girişim hala mevcut değildir. Bealdin projesi haric!</p>
<h2>Bealdin Projesi</h2>
<h2><img alt=""Bealdin Project"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/53589220/indiegogo/bealdin.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></h2>
<p>Bealdin Internet Cinini 3 aşamada gerçekleştireceğiz.</p>
<p>A Aşaması sonunda, Ingilizce konuşabilen Bealdin Internet Cinini hazırlayacağız; böylece, diğer ülke cinlerine kolaylıkla uyarlayabileceğimiz bir prototipimiz olacak. Biz Turkce konuşan insanlar olduğumuz halde Bealdin Cinini Ingilizce hazırlamamızın sebebi, Ingilizce'nin dünyaca yaygın, ortak bir dil olmasıdır.</p>
<p>B Amasında, eş zamanlı olarak, farklı dillerde hizmet edebilen, Bealdin Ülke Cinlerini hazırlayacağız. Amacımız, mümkün olan en kısa sürede, Bealdin Internet Cinini Dünya'nin hemen her ülkesinde, kullanıcıların kendi dillerinde servis edebilmek.</p>
<p>Şu anda A aşamasının hemen öncesindeyiz. En uygun 6 proje partnerimizle birlikte, AB 8.ci Çerceve fonlarına, 4 Milyon Euro bütçe ile muracaat etmek için proje teklifimizi hazırlıyoruz.</p>
<h2><strong>Sizden destek istememizin nedeni</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Daha önce de belirttiğimiz gibi, Bealdin Internet Cini, ancak çok disiplinli ve çok uluslu işbirliği sonucu gerçekleştirilebilecek bir projedir. Şu anda, Avrupa ve Dünya'nın farklı ülkelerinin saygın Ünversiteleri, kurumları ve yazılım ekiplerinden oluşmuş Bealdin Insiyatifi adını verdiğimiz bir yapilanmanın Lideri konumundayız. Bu kurumlarda görev yapan Bilim İnsanları, Uzmanları ve yazılımcıları Bealdin projesine sadık kalarak çözümler geliştirmeleri için yönlendirmek, koordine etmek görevini yürütüyoruz. Özveriyle çalışan küçük bir ekibimiz var ancak AB 8. ci Çerçeve Fonlarına teklif hazırladığımız bu aşamada, ekibimizi genişletmemiz, bir kaç profesyoneli işe almamız, ve şartlara uygun ofis, ekipman ihtiyaçlarımızı karşılamamız gerekiyor.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Bunun yanında, çok uluslu ekip çalışmalarında, sözlü ve yazılı iletişim tek başına yeterli olmadığından, partnerlerimizle bir araya gelerek yüz-yüze çalışmamız ve bunun için Atölye çalışmaları planlamamız, ve partnerlerimizin seyahat, konaklama giderlerini karşılayabilmemiz gerekiyor.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Sizin desteğinizi bu nedenle istiyoruz. Hedeflediğimiz 100 Bin Dolara ulaşamasak bile, destek verdiğiniz kadarıyla yukarıda saydığımız ihtiyaçlarımızın bazılarını karşılayabiliriz.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Eğer 100 bin Dolar dan daha fazla destek alabilirsek, 2. ci aşama çalışmalarını hemen başlatabilir, Bealdin Ülkelerini daha kısa sürede hizmete sokabiliriz.</span></p>

We are working on it
Some projects are the pioneers of the Science and Technology to change the societies and the World to the better. As Bealdin project is. We are working on the permanent, flexible Bealdin semantic infrastructure as a part of semantic web to integrate human presence in it. We aim to develop the next generation Internet which will recognize you as a unique anonymous person to personalize your short and long term expectations.
Who we are
My name is Atilla Coskun, the founder and the leader of Bealdin project. Since the beginning, Bealdin Project had been found very interesting by scientists, experts, developers and ordinary users. It took time to bring different disciplines of Science and Technology together. At this moment, more than 40 universities, organizations, software companies of the Europe and the World have come together in Bealdin Initiative, awaiting to take role in Bealdin Project Development in different stages. So, we are Bealdin Project Office, performing Coordination&Organization activities with a small team. That's why we are here asking for your contribution.
How we will do it
Currently, Internet is made for human to read, understand, interpret and use. For example, actually, your computer, even this server publishing this web page; cannot understand what is written here and what is its use for. 
Semantic web, enables machine to read, understand, interpret and process the information on Internet. Problem is, there is not any initiative yet to enable machine to understand, interpret and process the data about human. Except Bealdin Project.
Internet Will recognize you as a unique personality
As soon as Bealdin is ready to serve, you will be recognizable by machine, applications, services on the Internet through your anonymous, Descriptive Personal Data with Bealdin Assistance. It means that, machine will be aware of your likes, dislikes, wishes, demands, desires and interests to personalize the Internet for you, instead of your manual efforts.
Bealdin Project
We will develop Bealdin Internet genie in 3 stages.
In stage A, we will develop Bealdin English Spoken Genie which is also prototype of Bealdin national language Spoken Genies. In Stage B, we will develop Bealdin nations simultaneously to serve Bealdin to the national users in their national Languages. Stage C will enable independent developers to create new, personalized services for Bealdin users worldwide.
Our current objective is Stage A- Bealdin English Spoken Internet Genie development. To this purpose, we are preparing our project proposal for European Commission FP8 Funds with about 6 partners and 4M Euro Budget. We'll chose the right partners carefully for Stage A, which are some of the respectful member Universities, Organizations, Software developers of Bealdin Initiative. More info>>
What we need
We have a small team and the job we face is huge. We should keep Bealdin Project in the route while working with Multi Disciplinary, Multi National experts from the respectful Universities, organizations, software companies of the Europe and the World.
With your contribution, we will, expand our office team, hire a few professionals to perform organization and coordination tasks sufficiently.
More than that, documentation and verbal communication is not efficient enough for the international team work; we need to come together for face to face meetings. With your contribution, we will be able to organize workshops by supplying travel, hotel and workshop expenses.
If we cannot reach to our goal 100K, any amount of your contribution will supply some of our organizational requirements.
If we can reach 200K; we will start Stage B, Bealdin National language Spoken Genies Development process immediately, for as much as nations we can.

Söyle ki; Bealdin sizi, isimsiz olarak, tanimlayıcı kisisel verilerinizle tanıyacak; Internet üzerindeki diğer makinalarla sizin adınıza haberleşerek onların sizin dilek, ihtiyaç ve beklentilerinizi kişiselleştirebilmesini sağlayacaktır; sizin yerinize ve yorulmaksızın.
Türkiye'nin Desteği
Biz; Bealdin Projesinin kurucuları ve tasarımcıları; biz bu ülkenin yurttaşlarıyız. Biz; Zengin ve kadim Anadolu kültürünün mirasçıları; göle maya çalmaya kalkan; Aşk için dağlarin delinebileceğine inanan insanların torunlarıyız. Bealdin'i ilk kez hayal ettiğimizde, bu işin nasıl para kazanabileceğini bile düşünmeden, “hadi yapalım” diyebilmemize; bir ileri bir geri, cebimizdeki parayı son kuruşa kadar harcayabilmemize; yıllar boyunca, özel hayatımızı, uykularımızı ideallerimiz uğruna heba edebilmemize sebep olan şey; bize dedelerimizden kalan, “Kafaya koyduğu şey için sonuna kadar uğraşı verme” inadıdır.
İçinde bulunduğumuz durumda onlara; göle nasıl maya çalınabileceğini, dağların nasıl delinebileceğini, Bealdin'in nasıl yapılabileceğini anlatabildiğimiz içindir ki; Avrupa'nin ve Dünya'nın, konusunda saygın ve uzman Üniversitelerinin, Organizasyonlarının, yazılım ekiplerinin Bealdin Projesine tam desteğini alabildik. Eğer başarılı olamasaydık, her Anadolu insanının yapacağı gibi “Canımız sağolsun” der yolumuza devam ederdik. Başarılı olabildiğimiz ve proje partnerlerimizden Bilim-Teknoloji-Ekip desteği alabildiğimiz için buradayız ve hala çalışıyoruz.
İşte tam simdi, sizlerin, Türkiye'nin desteğini umuyor ve bekliyoruz. Sizin bu kampanyaya vereceğiniz destek, diğer ülke insanlarının vereceği destekler için teşvik ve ülkemizin Bealdin Projesine gösterdiği desteğe kanıt olacaktır.

Çalışmaya devam ediyoruz
Bazı projeler, toplumları ve Dünya'yı daha iyiye doğru değiştirebilmek için Bilim ve Teknolojiye öncülük ederler. Bealdin Projesinin yaptığı gibi. Üzerinde çalıştığımız projenin amacı; kalıcı, farklı teknolojilere göre yeniden biçimlendirilebilir, anlamsal (semantic) bir yazılım mimarisi içerisine, bir birey olarak insanı eklemlemek. Bu sayede, Bealdin asistanlığında, Internet'in sizi özel bir kişi olarak tanıyabilmesini ve hizmetlerini size göre kişselleştirmesini sağlayacağız.
Biz Kimiz
Ben Atilla Coşkun, Bealdin projesinin kurucusu ve Lideriyim. İlk günden itibaren, Bealdin fikri, bilim insanları, uzmanlar, ve sıradan Internet kullanıcıları için çok ilginç olarak değerlendirilmişti. Ancak, bilim ve teknolojiyi ayni potada eritip, Bealdin Internet Cininin nasıl yapılabileceğini gösterebilmek yıllrımızı aldı. Şu anda, Bealdin Insiyatifi çerçevesinde, 40 ın üzerinde Üniversite, organizasyon, yazılım ekibi, Bealdin projesinin farklı aşamalarının uygulanmasında rol almak için bizim seçim yapmamızı bekliyorlar. Biz, Bealdin Proje Ofisi olarak, Bealdin Projesinin Organizasyon ve Koordinasyon işlerini yürütüyoruz. Sizden destek istememizin nedeni, üstlendiğimiz bu görevi daha iyi yapabilmemiz ile ilgili.
Nasıl yapmayı planlıyoruz
Şu anda kullandığınız Internet, insanların okuyup anlaması, yorumlayıp kullanması için yapılmıştır. Örneğin, şu anda bu yazıyı okuduğunuz bilgisayar; hatta bu yazıyı yayınlayan sunucu, burada ne yazdığını ve yazılanların ne işe yaradığının farkında bile değil.
Semantik Web, yeni bir teknoloji olarak, bilgisayarların (makinaların) Internet üzerindeki bilgileri okuyup anlamalarını, yorumlayıp insanların yararına işleyebilmelerini sağlar. Buna rağmen, makinaların, Internet kullanıcıları ile ilgili verileri okuyup, yorumlayıp, kişiler yararına kullanmalarını sağlayabilecek bir proje, bir girişim hala mevcut değildir. Bealdin projesi haric!
Bealdin Projesi

Bealdin Internet Cinini 3 aşamada gerçekleştireceğiz.
A Aşaması sonunda, Ingilizce konuşabilen Bealdin Internet Cinini hazırlayacağız; böylece, diğer ülke cinlerine kolaylıkla uyarlayabileceğimiz bir prototipimiz olacak. Biz Turkce konuşan insanlar olduğumuz halde Bealdin Cinini Ingilizce hazırlamamızın sebebi, Ingilizce'nin dünyaca yaygın, ortak bir dil olmasıdır.
B Amasında, eş zamanlı olarak, farklı dillerde hizmet edebilen, Bealdin Ülke Cinlerini hazırlayacağız. Amacımız, mümkün olan en kısa sürede, Bealdin Internet Cinini Dünya'nin hemen her ülkesinde, kullanıcıların kendi dillerinde servis edebilmek.
Şu anda A aşamasının hemen öncesindeyiz. En uygun 6 proje partnerimizle birlikte, AB 8.ci Çerceve fonlarına, 4 Milyon Euro bütçe ile muracaat etmek için proje teklifimizi hazırlıyoruz.
Sizden destek istememizin nedeni
Daha önce de belirttiğimiz gibi, Bealdin Internet Cini, ancak çok disiplinli ve çok uluslu işbirliği sonucu gerçekleştirilebilecek bir projedir. Şu anda, Avrupa ve Dünya'nın farklı ülkelerinin saygın Ünversiteleri, kurumları ve yazılım ekiplerinden oluşmuş Bealdin Insiyatifi adını verdiğimiz bir yapilanmanın Lideri konumundayız. Bu kurumlarda görev yapan Bilim İnsanları, Uzmanları ve yazılımcıları Bealdin projesine sadık kalarak çözümler geliştirmeleri için yönlendirmek, koordine etmek görevini yürütüyoruz. Özveriyle çalışan küçük bir ekibimiz var ancak AB 8. ci Çerçeve Fonlarına teklif hazırladığımız bu aşamada, ekibimizi genişletmemiz, bir kaç profesyoneli işe almamız, ve şartlara uygun ofis, ekipman ihtiyaçlarımızı karşılamamız gerekiyor.
Bunun yanında, çok uluslu ekip çalışmalarında, sözlü ve yazılı iletişim tek başına yeterli olmadığından, partnerlerimizle bir araya gelerek yüz-yüze çalışmamız ve bunun için Atölye çalışmaları planlamamız, ve partnerlerimizin seyahat, konaklama giderlerini karşılayabilmemiz gerekiyor.
Sizin desteğinizi bu nedenle istiyoruz. Hedeflediğimiz 100 Bin Dolara ulaşamasak bile, destek verdiğiniz kadarıyla yukarıda saydığımız ihtiyaçlarımızın bazılarını karşılayabiliriz.
Eğer 100 bin Dolar dan daha fazla destek alabilirsek, 2. ci aşama çalışmalarını hemen başlatabilir, Bealdin Ülkelerini daha kısa sürede hizmete sokabiliriz.
İkramiyeler (Perks)
Size sunduğumuz ikramiyeler, Bealdin Internet Cininin geleceğinde şimdiden  yer almanızı sağlamak içindir. Örneğin, Bealdin Internet Cininin nasıl görüneceğini seçen Jüride yer alabilir; Herkezden once Bealdin'in ilk kişisel ve projesyonel kullanıcısı olabilir; veya %75 indirimle Profesyonel amaçlarınız için kullanabileceğiniz Bealdin Kredilerini şimdiden ayırtabilirsiniz.

<p>Greetings All! I am Jose Farrugia, a tech geek blogger and YouTuber who creates content and runs <a href=""http://www.wiredmash.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>WiredMash</strong></a>. Over the past two years I have created hundreds of technology articles, wrote a few gadget reviews and most of all produced hours worth of tech galore videos.</p>

Whatever your contribution, may it be $1 or a whoopping $100, I'll be grateful with whatever you give. I'll even appreciate it if you can let the word out and make some noise on my campaign if you opt not to contribute.</p>

<p>Your contributions will go directly to the essentials such as the flights, accommodation, food and transportation. Here's a breakdown of the budget intended for Computex 2013:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>4 Flights</strong> from Cebu to Manila, Manila to Taipei, Taipei to Manila and Manila to Cebu (Philippine Airlines) = $400 (PHP16,000)</li>

<strong>5 Nights in Taipei</strong> = $437.50 (PHP17,500)</li>
<li>
<strong>Food Expenses</strong> = $90 (PHP3,600)</li>

<strong>Transportation Expenses</strong> (Subway, Bus and Taxi) = $37.50 (PHP1,500)</li>
<li>
<strong>Airport Taxes and Fees</strong> (Philippines) = $37.50 (PHP1,500)</li>
<li>
<strong>Indigogo Fees </strong>= $75 (PHP3,000)</li>

<h2>Why</h2>
<p>I have always dreamt of working on a job which I passionately love doing. That's the main reason why I quit my day job and shifted all my attention to WiredMash. WiredMash has become my day job. Some say it's a risky attempt especially with the rewards being only a hundred dollars every quarter from advertising (for now).</p>
<p>I may not be like one of the tech giants like Engadget, The Verge, Gizmodo or other successful YouTubers like Chris Pirillo, however, I hope to reach their level one of these days - ""A Journey of a Thousand Miles Begins with One Step"".</p>
<p>I thank you in advance to all my contributors, sponsors, subscribers, viewers, readers and friends out there. Without you guys, I wouldn't be writing and producing videos. Your support is greatly appreciated!</p>

I have always dreamt of working on a job which I passionately love doing. That's the main reason why I quit my day job and shifted all my attention to WiredMash. WiredMash has become my day job. Some say it's a risky attempt especially with the rewards being only a hundred dollars every quarter from advertising (for now).
I may not be like one of the tech giants like Engadget, The Verge, Gizmodo or other successful YouTubers like Chris Pirillo, however, I hope to reach their level one of these days - ""A Journey of a Thousand Miles Begins with One Step"".
I thank you in advance to all my contributors, sponsors, subscribers, viewers, readers and friends out there. Without you guys, I wouldn't be writing and producing videos. Your support is greatly appreciated!

We are very fortunate to have World Key Services, an international product sourcing and management company with over 20 years of experience in China, making sure that our quality stays high and that we are working with great manufacturers. We’ve had the opportunity to do some test marketing and get valuable feedback from Budley users - we’ve arrived at the point where we are ready to confidently fulfill our Indiegogo orders. Our goal is to bring Budley to people who are really going to love finding this terrific solution for their earbuds! </p>

Coffee, precisely time to meet our morning schedule, is set to brew in readiness for us after we emerge from the shower, shaved, coiffed, and looking great. After we check our electronic devices for messages, weather reports, and traffic alerts, we head out into the world. All’s well. Technology has made it possible for modern men and women to control their environment. That is, until Mother Nature decides that it’s time to remind people who’s really in control, and suddenly there’s a tornado/storm/high wind warning/ hurricane/earthquake/wildfire/. Lines are down, the power is out, and you feel like you’ve been cast back into the Stone Age. You’re scrambling in the dark to find a flashlight.

Since that means everyone, it’s time to listen up and pay attention to the features offered in this campaign project. This smart, self-powered SoS Charger allows you to charge your smart phone so that you can stay in contact with work, family, and friends. The smart flashlight not only gives you light to see with when the lack of electricity leaves you in the dark, but if you keep it plugged into an outlet, it comes on when the power goes off, and has two levels of brightness for improved visibility. The AM/FM radio station also comes with seven NOAA weather channels and superior reception. The Slive-4U can help keep a light shining when the power goes out.<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/840807/files/20140907134135-slive.gif?1410122495"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>It is developed on the foundation of Slive's high efficiency power generation technology, which we call S-power. This technology is optimized by a team with fifteen years of experience in self-powered radio manufacturing. </p><p>On top of S-power, we developed integrated S-power (iS-power) technology and made some concept products specifically for the US market. In 2011, the fruit of this effort came to be --- Slive-4U. </p><p>Slive-4U is built on top of iS-power technology and has several important features for SOS situations embedded, such as power outage sensing, NOAA weather band, and alarm alert, etc. The Slive-4U you see today already went through two prototype phases and production line testing. It is truly mass-production-ready product. Therefore, we are extremely confident that you can get Slive-4u within our promised time frame. </p><p><br/></p><p></p><h2><b>The Smart Part of Slive-4U</b></h2><div>

<p>Ever trying to search for a flashlight in darkness?</p>
<p>Well, search no more. Just keep your Slive-4U plugged-in. When power outage strikes, Slive-4U would detect the loss of power and automatically turn on its flashlight. </p>
<p>With Slive-4U, you won't have to worry about navigate your house in a power-outage anymore!</p>
<h2 style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>USB Bridge Function</b></h2>
<p>The USB Bridge function of Slive-4U allows you to power your USB-powered device (be it a phone, a fan, or others) while you're enjoying the radio.  Thus you can power two devices from a single electrical outlet.</p>

NOAA Radio and iS-power technology. Technology vs. NatureWe live in the most technologically advanced age that the world has ever seen, with devices that make our lives easier than they’ve ever been in human history. We awaken in the morning to music that eases us from slumber, with a snooze button within reach to give us a few more minutes of sleep. Coffee, precisely time to meet our morning schedule, is set to brew in readiness for us after we emerge from the shower, shaved, coiffed, and looking great. After we check our electronic devices for messages, weather reports, and traffic alerts, we head out into the world. All’s well. Technology has made it possible for modern men and women to control their environment. That is, until Mother Nature decides that it’s time to remind people who’s really in control, and suddenly there’s a tornado/storm/high wind warning/ hurricane/earthquake/wildfire/. Lines are down, the power is out, and you feel like you’ve been cast back into the Stone Age. You’re scrambling in the dark to find a flashlight. You need a radio so that you can find out what’s going on. You need to charge your phone. But you’re helpless.
It’s true that, impressive as Silicon Valley advances are, and as vastly as its inventions have altered our lives, weather still calls the shots, and we all know that technology and electricity are at its beck and call when Nature slams us with a disaster. Anyone who’s been paying attention has noticed that weather seems to be having tantrums all around the globe, whether it’s earthquakes in China, flooding in the Midwest, or a lightning strike next door.Slive-4U is here to helpSlive-4U, a rescue device that’s a must-have for anyone for whom electricity is vital and technology is necessary. Since that means everyone, it’s time to listen up and pay attention to the features offered in this campaign project. This smart, self-powered SoS Charger allows you to charge your smart phone so that you can stay in contact with work, family, and friends. The smart flashlight not only gives you light to see with when the lack of electricity leaves you in the dark, but if you keep it plugged into an outlet, it comes on when the power goes off, and has two levels of brightness for improved visibility. The AM/FM radio station also comes with seven NOAA weather channels and superior reception. The Slive-4U can help keep a light shining when the power goes out.It is developed on the foundation of Slive's high efficiency power generation technology, which we call S-power. This technology is optimized by a team with fifteen years of experience in self-powered radio manufacturing. On top of S-power, we developed integrated S-power (iS-power) technology and made some concept products specifically for the US market. In 2011, the fruit of this effort came to be --- Slive-4U. Slive-4U is built on top of iS-power technology and has several important features for SOS situations embedded, such as power outage sensing, NOAA weather band, and alarm alert, etc. The Slive-4U you see today already went through two prototype phases and production line testing. It is truly mass-production-ready product. Therefore, we are extremely confident that you can get Slive-4u within our promised time frame. The Smart Part of Slive-4U

Ever trying to search for a flashlight in darkness?
Well, search no more. Just keep your Slive-4U plugged-in. When power outage strikes, Slive-4U would detect the loss of power and automatically turn on its flashlight. 
With Slive-4U, you won't have to worry about navigate your house in a power-outage anymore!
USB Bridge Function
The USB Bridge function of Slive-4U allows you to power your USB-powered device (be it a phone, a fan, or others) while you're enjoying the radio.  Thus you can power two devices from a single electrical outlet.

While we've spent almost three years developing the technology and methodology behind our Hashtagger platform we also became fanatical about simplifying its use.  
We are a start-up firm based in Austin, Texas (Longhorns, SXSW, state capital, live music capital of the world, world's largest urban bat colony, etc.) whose singular mission as a FAAS (feedback-as-a-service) is to facilitate more effective communication modalities.  The STATUUS development team has direct design, manufacturing, coding and testing experience with some of the largest tech companies in the world, including Texas Instruments, BMC Software, Freescale Semiconductor (previously a division of Motorola), and others.  We have a growing IP portfolio and patents pending.




Unlike Austin's bats, we're not fly-by-night.  In case we do not reach our Indiegogo funding goals we are still moving fast ahead building out our platform.  This platform we believe will disrupt several widely-known industries while making it easier for consumers, organizations, and businesses to do what they do.  Your support today will help:


Complete fast prototyping, firmware, and testing


Further API and OPEN platform SDK development

Oversee PCB/component manufacturing and supply chain

Gain applicable certifications such as FCC, UL, BLE, & CE 

Purchase the tooling for scale production of our products

Increase domestic jobs by being assembled in the U.S.
Fund materials, production, marketing, and fulfillment










A huge plus in crowdfunding is that YOU get to participate in the development process. Have an idea to enhance one of our designs or include a specific feature? Just let us know and we'll determine if it's feasible.  STATUUS invites all soccer moms, techies, professionals, and the entire community of supporters to visit our developer's forum, Hashtagger Geeks, to voice your opinions, post technical solutions, make suggestions, and network ideas and resources.





 




We're assembling an amazing team of industry professionals at STATUUS however there is always the potential for unforeseen factors that may cause setbacks or delays in our plans.  Any delay such as in gaining certain required certifications, lack of component availability, prototype changes or additions, etc. will be tackled expeditiously and transparently so that our user-community and supporters will always be informed.   Some components such as the SmartHub and window/door sensors are ready to be OEM-packaged and shipped once we include the finalized versions of firmware and application interface.  




We've built the cost of U.S. domestic ground shipping* into the price of our Indiegogo perks.

(Rendered to highlight charging method only.  Shown in watermark background is cradle [see 3/4],user control panel [see 7/8], plug-in adapter [see 24-29], and wall receptacle option [Fig.3] )




Q1: Will Hashtagger work on a iPhone, Samsung, LG or Windows phone?
A1: Hashtagger is compatible with Android, Tizen, and Windows Qi-compliant phones right out the box. Qi (pronounced ""Chee"") is the global wireless charging standard. iPhones 4, 5, and 6 will require a receiver- widely available as a charging sleeve and protective cover (also see iPhone wireless charging). Click [ here ] to find out if your smart phone is Qi-enabled or requires a charging cover.







Q2: How does the Hashtagger charger work?A2: Hashtagger delivers up to 5 volts of power to your phone, tablet, or phablet and supports both Qi version 1.1 induction design and the newly-announced version 1.2 resonance design. Smart functions such as turning off/on your stereo, tv, perimeter, motion and fire detection, adjusting your home's heating and cooling temperature settings and more can be controlled from anywhere in the world with available WiFi via the Hashtagger mobile app.




Q3: What does 'hashtagger' mean?


A3: The 'Hashtagger' trademark refers to our proprietary method of using personal hashtag keywords to display a specific color of alert someone's Hashtagger wall unit or phone. The colors- red, blue, green, and yellow, may represent a priority, a person, or both!


Q4: Do I need to buy a Hashtagger before I can send prioritized texts?

A4: Nope.  Just download our FREE Hashtagger app and you're off to the races.  Of course, your intended receiver must have either the Hashtagger app or Hashtagger charger to see the priority. 

Q5: Can Hashtagger save me money on my utility bills?
A5: Yes, definitely.



Q6: Do all my light switches need to be replaced to use Hashtagger?


A6:  No, just replace the receptacle that's conducive for your lifestyle.  Simples.


Q7: Will I still be able to use my outlets or light switch?
A7: Yes.  With Hashtagger Plug-Ins and its two-socket configuration, one socket will be available for your normal use while the other socket is needed to supply AC power to the Hashtagger unit and provide stability.  All wall-mounted Hashtaggers have light-switch functions (on/off/dimmer) built in.  With SmartHub, you'll have the freedom and flexibility to control lights, appliances and electronics in your home from anywhere in the world!  






Q8: What's a smart hub and do I need one for Hashtagger to work?


A8: While the Hashtaggers are your ""eyes and ears"" around your home, SmartHub is the ""brains"" of the operation connecting all of the different sensors and beacons around your home.  If you're only looking at using the ""brawn"" and convenience of the basic charging and notification functions of Hashtagger then no- you won't need a hub.  Anyone with WiFi can plug in and set up the SmartHub in about 10 minutes- including beer or snack time!



Q9: Will it work with iBeacons and smart home hub I already have?A9: Hashtagger will work with any Wi-Fi enabled open-source smart home product including motion sensors, security cams, even IoT coffee makers.



Q10: Do I need an electrician to install the Hashtagger?


A10: It's optional to use the Hashtagger Plug-in with or without your existing outlet faceplate.  If you plan on locating the Hashtagger Plug-In in a high use location- we'd suggest replacing your existing outlet faceplate which normally is attached by one external screw to help ensure unit stability. If you're not comfortable replacing a light switch receptacle, a licensed electrician can easily install the wall-mounted Hashtagger for you.



Q11: What happens if you don't meet your funding goal?A11: We welcome each and every dollar, mention, and referral from our supporters- yet since we so strongly believe in our platform and our products as do many others, we are totally committed to bringing the Hashtagger to market.  Your support today will help us do it that much quicker and lock in the lowest price as first adopters.



Q12: Will the Hashtagger Plug-In work on UK and Canadian type outlets?A12: Yes, international adapters will be available for UK, HK, and Canadian style sockets?



Q13: Will my custom settings be lost if my home's power goes out?


A13: No, Hashtagger utilizes flash memory and will still maintain your custom settings when power is restored.



Q14: What prevents others from using or controlling my Hashtagger?A14: Hashtagger utilizes link codes and 256-bit encryption that only authorize devices you select so that control functions are not compromised. 



Q15: Great idea.  Is it patented?A15: We have multiple patents pending on file with the USPTO and other entities. If ever you do spot a similar product popping up somewhere, please email us and include a link if possible so that we may take the proper legal measures to prevent infringement.  Our loyal supporters are our best eyes, ears, and spokespersons!



Q16: When can I expect delivery of my Hashtagger?

A16: We plan Early Bird delivery for the latter part of Q4 2015.  That's a few weeks longer than 1 year following our successful IGG campaign.


Q17: What warranty applies to the Hashtagger?A17: All Hashtagger devices will carry a one-year limited warranty.



Q18: LMAO @ toon!!!  But did Sly really have a love child?


A18: Uhm, we'll get back to you on THAT one...

IDLE-FREE Team Thanks and Closing Statement.
The Children's Clean Air Network / GoGreen Guys
The Children's Clean Air Network began as a grassroots campaign in 2006 at Kingswood Elementary School, near Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.
It became a non-profit network of schools, business and community leaders dedicated to reducing vehicle emissions across North America.
Today its mission is served by GoGreen Communications, the 'go green agency.'

GoGreen Guys:
Ron Zima, hockey dad, 'IDLE-FREE Guy', founder of The Children's Clean Air Network and 'IDLE-FREE for our kids', Canada's Leading IDLE-FREE Campaign.
Ron says, ""In 2005, I made a promise to my kids to do something big for the environment.""
Tom Nicolle, 'Numbers Nicolle', chief financial wizard. Tom is a passionate dad who wants everybody to 'go green for our kids.'
Tom says, ""These numbers really add up.""
David Heath, 'chief creative carbon cutter'. Dave's creative and technical genius helps cut carbon in fun ways, for the enormous benefit of all.
Dave loves thinking about 'people, planet, and partnerships.'
A PERSONAL THANK YOU FROM 'IDLE-FREE Guy'

<p>If you could make one wish, what would it be?</p>
<p>If it's humanly possible, it can be accomplished with Verse.</p>
<p>Verse is an open source and publicly viewable system for distributing and delegating requests across social networks. Users of Verse can make requests of each other, as well as forward those requests or split them into subrequests to send to other users. The chain of requests can be viewed by each participant in graph form, allowing for participants at different parts of the request tree to directly contact each other.</p>
<p>Small-scale requests such as ""run a theatre production of Hamlet"" can be delegated to friends to ""cast actors,"" ""acquire costumes,"" ""design stage makeup,"" and ""design sets.""</p>
<p>Large-scale requests such as ""deal with global warming"" can be passed through academic circles in the form of ""research global warming effects,"" ""design sustainable transportation technologies"" and ""design sustainable agricultural methods,"" and forwarded to associations who have connections with manufacturers, farmers and politicians.</p>
<p>Verse works because openly viewable social networks allow people to collaborate and get things done better.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<div> <h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Release Priorities</h3>
<p>Our first priority is to make Verse as a website. Once the website proves to be stable and functional, we'll shift focus toward making it feasible to share requests through email, mobile devices, and social media. If we surpass our fundraising goal, we will increase our team size to accomplish these goals sooner and work on extra features.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We need money so we can work on this full-time. The more money we get, the more people we can get on board to work on making Verse integrate with current webservices as soon as possible.</p>
<p>People who throw money at us will get the first requests to join Verse, to share and play with however they like.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Impact</h3> <p>This project has the potential to facilitate human needs on a global scale. With every adaptation to new mediums, people using Verse will have more power to make large requests of their social network.

The film was placed on the phone’s screen to protect the screen. Therefore, buying protective cases was expensive at that time.</p><p>In 2013, a new panel coating technology, geared to offer both screen and back panel protection, was discovered. The technology enabled protective cases to withstand a scratching force of up to 750 grams. Besides, the protective cases would only take three minutes to self-heal from the scratching force.In 2014, spray coating technology was discovered and later improved through research to form a transparent coat that prevented scratches. This technology brought the invention of the instant self-repair case.</p><p>The instant self-repair technology has led to the production of protective cases that has an improved aesthetic value. The quick self-repair of the protective case allows the surface of the phone to remain intact even after a relatively high scratch force. innerexile has won design awards, leading to a market footprint in more than thirty countries worldwide.

The film was placed on the phone’s screen to protect the screen. Therefore, buying protective cases was expensive at that time.In 2013, a new panel coating technology, geared to offer both screen and back panel protection, was discovered. The technology enabled protective cases to withstand a scratching force of up to 750 grams. Besides, the protective cases would only take three minutes to self-heal from the scratching force.In 2014, spray coating technology was discovered and later improved through research to form a transparent coat that prevented scratches. This technology brought the invention of the instant self-repair case.The instant self-repair technology has led to the production of protective cases that has an improved aesthetic value. The quick self-repair of the protective case allows the surface of the phone to remain intact even after a relatively high scratch force. innerexile has won design awards, leading to a market footprint in more than thirty countries worldwide. Awards include Good Design award from 2012 to 2014,Golden Pin Design award, Taiwan Excellence award in 2014 and Computex d&I award in 2014 for their products.",77.0,4,"1 Campaign

We are two 17 year old engineers with a project that has the potential to save many lives and would be a very beneficial tool to rescue teams such as firefighters, law enforcement, etc.</p>
<h3>What's your project about?</h3>
<p>The main focus of this project is to create a remotely operated robot that can navigate a dangerous situation such as a natural disaster or a fire, locate that person in need of rescue, provide them with nourishment &amp; fluids, and then extract them from that situation <strong>without any direct human aid</strong>.  This is what differentiates this robot from other robots currently on the market.  Those robots can simply locate, but you still have to put a rescuer at risk in order to extract that person from the dangerous situation.  The elegant solution is to create a robot that can locate and <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">extract,</span> which is what we have designed here.</p>
<h3>
<br/>Credentials? How Can I trust you?</h3>
<p>I built the first iteration of this project last year without funding or additional help and entered it into my local science and engineering fair. I ended up advancing to state and then eventually to the International competition called I-SWEEEP where I received a <strong>silver medal out 600 students from 68 different countries.</strong><br/> If you are interested more about the first iteration, check out the powerpoint I made for my presentation. <a href=""https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1r91IPA8cocDVKYym-q3FG1u2_KiMBMK7AcrccRV5G8U/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1r91IPA8cocDVKYym-q3FG1u2_KiMBMK7AcrccRV5G8U/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>
<p><br/>I did not just want to stop there because I felt there was much more potential with this project so we began designing VoltX 2.0.  We are very excited about this new model. The whole design has been revised with many additions, but is based off iteration 1. We have created a complete model of the frame in Solidworks and schematics &amp; PCB layout in Express. I learned my lesson with the first iteration that it's better to have everything planned out initially than having to run into it later. Everything is laid out in CAD so there are no surprises.</p>
<h3>So what's so special about this design?</h3>
<p>Victim Extraction System (VES) can extract people with shoulder widths ranging from 10-18 inches</p>
<p>Proprietary track and suspension system offer great mobility over the toughest of terrains</p>
<p>Live HD video and audio feed anywhere with celluar coverage</p>
<p>360 degrees of vision</p>
<p>Capable of pulling a payload of approximately 200 lbs</p>
<p>Rugged steel frame (welded)</p>
<p>20 watts of illumination</p>
<p>Controlled by Xbox 360 controller<br/><br/>Fully waterproof design</p>
<p>Temperature sensing</p>
<p><br/>A U.S defense contractor called Alliant Tech Systems (ATK) saw the potential in this project and offered support. All of the designs have been verified by professional engineers and they have offered to partially fund the robot itself.</p>
<h3>
<br/>Why do you need my help then?</h3>
<p>So why we need your help is for the purchase of precision machinery and the rest of the robot. We would like VoltX 2.0 to be 'implement ready' meaning once it's completed, it could be utilized in live rescue situations. Three pieces of equipment are essential to this project: a drill press, horizontal metal cutting band saw, and a set of cobalt drill bits.  We also need to pay for  the welding fees.</p>

Replacing these cables can be quite costly, at $30 a piece they can really add up. CordArmor's built in LED puts an end to those nightly struggles with your iDevice's tiny charge port. If you own an iPhone, iPad, or iPod that uses the lightning cable, then CordArmor is a must have. For a fraction of the cost to replace the cable you can eliminate the need to eventually purchase a replacement.</p><h3><b><i>How does it function?</i></b></h3><p>CordArmor is made of an ultra-durable Polypropylene plastic and a unibody design to provide a long lasting and easy to use product. The greater surface area and traction embossment are intended to allow you to remove your charger from its port with ease! So STOP pulling on the cord and damaging your lifeline to the most important accessory that you own.</p><p>If you have suffered the inevitable ""iPhone cable fray,"" then you are already aware of its Achilles heel.

The housing then closes over the top to create a semi-permanent attachment to the cable. After extensive testing, CordArmor was shown to evenly distribute the force away from the weak points of the cable. </p><p>Cord Armor also features a built in LED light that is captivated by a momentary pressure switch to simplify low-light to no-light use. The ultra small and bright LED is powered by a 3V coin cell battery which provides about 2 years of usage considering that you are going to use it every night.</p><h3><b><i>How was CordArmor designed?</i></b></h3><p>CordArmor comes from humble beginnings.

</div>","CordArmorWhat is it that I am supporting again?CordArmor is a Patent Pending accessory primarily designed to improve durability of the Apple Lightning charging cable and improve its low-light usability. Replacing these cables can be quite costly, at $30 a piece they can really add up. CordArmor's built in LED puts an end to those nightly struggles with your iDevice's tiny charge port. If you own an iPhone, iPad, or iPod that uses the lightning cable, then CordArmor is a must have. For a fraction of the cost to replace the cable you can eliminate the need to eventually purchase a replacement.How does it function?CordArmor is made of an ultra-durable Polypropylene plastic and a unibody design to provide a long lasting and easy to use product. The greater surface area and traction embossment are intended to allow you to remove your charger from its port with ease! So STOP pulling on the cord and damaging your lifeline to the most important accessory that you own.If you have suffered the inevitable ""iPhone cable fray,"" then you are already aware of its Achilles heel. But in case you forgot, here is a picture to remind you...I can't speak for the entire world, but i'd be willing to bet that most people struggle to grip the factory plug and as a result remove the charger by tugging on the cable. Cord Armor was designed for the Lightning Cable to fit snug into a cavity and is supported by two interference teeth to secure the cable. The housing then closes over the top to create a semi-permanent attachment to the cable. After extensive testing, CordArmor was shown to evenly distribute the force away from the weak points of the cable. Cord Armor also features a built in LED light that is captivated by a momentary pressure switch to simplify low-light to no-light use. The ultra small and bright LED is powered by a 3V coin cell battery which provides about 2 years of usage considering that you are going to use it every night.How was CordArmor designed?CordArmor comes from humble beginnings. From an issue to a simple solution then to an amateur sketch. I sent the above image to a childhood friend of mine named Josh. Josh is a Mechanical Engineer who graduated from the University of Central Florida. We would then spend every day of the next six months developing what we now call CordArmor. As the actual design process began, CordArmor began to evolve...CordArmor Official Design...CordArmor Official Design Color Options...CordARMOR's PCB prototype...CordArmor has been tested to work with numbers different cases. Even the bulkiest of cases such as the LifeProof and Otterbox Cases pass with flying colors! Keep in mind that CordArmor is designed for Apple's OEM Lightning Cable which is the very best! CordArmor will also work with any aftermarket cables that meet Apples exact specs.Where is CordArmor in terms of progress?CordArmor is ready to rock! CordArmor has passed all necessary tests. Aside from a few aesthetic tweaks, the manufacturer is on standby and awaiting approval to begin production. Your support will allow us to begin the mold tooling, approve consumer-ready product samples, begin mass production, and deliver CordARMOR to you! Follow along with the progress as we approach our funding goal! The support hearts will begin to fill as we approach each Manufacturing check point! 1. Early December: Begin Mold Tooling2. 2 Weeks Later: Receive consumer ready samples for aesthetic and functional approval.3. Mid December: Initiate Mass Production.4. Early January: Test and Deliver each unit to you!With every pledge CordARMOR will be able to complete each necessary step to ensure delivery on January of 2014.Who are you supporting?I am a 27 year old college student who is looking to make a positive impact on this world. Ever since I can remember I have been conjuring up wild inventions to simplify life.  I have always hoped that I could become an inventor but never had the resources to make it possible.

<p class=""05BodyText""><strong>Our Story</strong></p>
<p class=""05BodyText"">Our founders were tired of paying high prices for unreliable internet access, horrible customer service, and having only one option for broadband internet access. The central problem we identified was that big old telecom companies were using big old technology to provide their services. In the mobile age, people on the go deserve constant connection for their laptops, smartphones, and tablets, and everything else! And it shouldn't be a luxury!</p>
<p class=""05BodyText""><strong>Bringing the Future to the Past</strong></p>
<p class=""05BodyText"">Many cities in Florida have been left in the past. Whether they are too far away or have too sparse a population, Big Telecom has left these municipalities in the dial-up age. If broadband internet is available, it's often through only a single provider. We believe that's called a monopoly, which we believe is bad for prices and customer service.</p>
<p class=""05BodyText"">Wisp will bring 4G Wireless Broadband over WiMAX to Gainesville and the other municipalities throughout Florida, classified as either micropolitan or rural, and who have little choice. Our goal is to do what big telecom never could, give you fast easy internet no matter how far out there you are. Being connected to the world should be considered an affordable necessity, not a luxury.</p>
<p class=""05BodyText""><strong>Bringing the Future to the Present</strong></p>
<p class=""05BodyText"">People live mobile lives. We are constantly on the go and the economy requires Americans to work longer hours in more places. Businesspeople and students are commonly crammed into coffee shops or anywhere else with a WiFi hotspot. The future we want to build is one where you can be connected anywhere you go. From parks to local business, from home to campus, you should be able to work and play from anywhere you please. Our 4G wireless network can give you 4 times the speed of 3G from anywhere in the city. With one subscription you can enjoy high speed internet anywhere you roam. This is the technology that realizes the true benefits of mobile devices.</p>

<p class=""05BodyText""><strong>Business Synopsis:</strong></p>
<p class=""05BodyText"">Wisp Networks’ core business will be the provision of high speed broadband access to the internet. The Company will provide “last mile” connection via a multi-frequency wireless access network built on scalable 4G technology. The distribution network will be built over multi-gigabit fiber optic cable. Connections from the distribution network to the internet backbone will be controlled by a data center owned and operated by the Company. This hybrid wireless-fiber network will provide broadband speeds to both commercial and residential accounts.</p>
<p class=""05BodyText"">Although Wisp Networks will be an internet service provider, the Company plans to compete in a variety of markets. The advantage of an entirely IP-based network is the ability to provide many services over a shared medium, such as digital video, voice communication and teleconferencing (VoIP), internet access, data-transfer, data hosting, email services, and application services. Wisp Networks plans to incrementally implement these value-added services, contingent upon proper demand and market research. Because the Company will is an ISP which competes in markets other than internet service provision (television, voice communications, etc.), Wisp Networks is considered a cross-boundary competitor in many markets.</p>
<p class=""03Second-LevelSubheadingBOLD""><strong>Mission Statement</strong></p>
<p class=""05BodyText"">The mission of Wisp Networks is to provide truly unlimited network access with unparalleled reliability and customer service. The Company seeks to provide the infrastructure which enables techno-centric life to become truly mobile, truly unlimited, and truly satisfied.</p>
<p class=""03Second-LevelSubheadingBOLD""><strong>Company Goals and Objectives</strong></p>
<p class=""05BodyText"">The goal of Wisp Networks is to provide high quality, low cost communication solutions to anyone who needs them. To meet this goal, several objectives must be met. Primarily, cost-effective equipment must be sourced to construct the required network at a cost that enables the Company to keep service subscriptions at a low cost to consumers compared to alternatives while maintaining sustainable margins. Secondarily, the Company will have to attract talent to assist in maintaining and managing the hybrid wireless-fiber network infrastructure which provides service to our clients.</p>
<p class=""05BodyText"">Customer satisfaction is valued highly by Wisp Networks. Reliable infrastructure is not enough to fully satisfy a client and the Company will need to build a capable customer support team to achieve high levels of perceived brand quality and product satisfaction in the communities we operate in.</p>
<p class=""03Second-LevelSubheadingBOLD""><strong>Business Philosophy</strong></p>
<p class=""05BodyText"">Our business philosophy is straightforward: Customers are happiest when the product meets their expectations. If a service is advertised as unlimited, it had better be unlimited. If a service is advertised at a particular price, it had better actually cost the client that price. As founders of Wisp Networks, we believe that following this philosophy will guide the decisions of the Company’s employees in the best direction: a value-focused direction.</p>
<p class=""03Second-LevelSubheadingBOLD""><strong>Target Market</strong></p>
<p class=""05BodyText"">The Company targets markets in which there are currently few competitors, high prices, and high dissatisfaction. It is the Company’s belief that consumers are dissatisfied with traditional telecom service models, customer service practices, and general prices of most large ISPs. Exacerbating the problem is the scarcity of competition; many areas of the United States with populations less than 100 thousand either do not have access to broadband networks or have only a single service provider. Wisp targets markets whose consumers will benefit from competition, lower prices, more options, and faster service. The Company believes that broadband internet access should be affordable and available to everyone, and never limited.</p>
<p class=""03Second-LevelSubheadingBOLD""><strong>The Internet Industry</strong></p>
<p class=""05BodyText"">Demand for internet access is increasing rapidly with current trends in business, consumer electronics, and consumer behaviors. Many firms are recognizing the drivers of demand for internet access and competition is expected to increase steadily in the near future.</p>
<p class=""05BodyText"">Recent research predicts that mobile data traffic will increase to more than 10 exabytes by 2016<a href=""#_ftn1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title="""">[1]</a>. Compound annual growth rates for mobile data are predicted to be 129% over the next five years in North America. As 4G mobile network technology, for most of the United States, is provided by a single ISP, if at all outside of major metropolitan areas.</p>
<p class=""05BodyText"">As 4G WiMAX technology increases its installed base, suppliers are finding newer ways to reduce the cost of their broadcast technologies. Wisp Networks intends to take advantage of the decreasing equipment cost to provide 4G mobile networks to consumers in locations where competition is sparse and demand growth is rapid.</p>
<p class=""05BodyText"">Wisp Networks is well poised to use its rapid deployment strategies, scalable equipment, hybridized network design, and integrated service model to sustain its early-mover advantage as more firms enter the market.</p>
<p class=""03Second-LevelSubheadingBOLD""><strong>Core Competencies and Competitive Advantage</strong></p>
<p class=""05BodyText"">The Company’s competitive advantage stems from its core competencies: Rapid deployment, a modern hybrid wireless-fiber network infrastructure, and an integrated service model. The wireless nature of the Company’s “last-mile” infrastructure enables new service areas to be constructed within days rather than the weeks or months it would take a traditional wireline company to lay cable. Wisp Networks relies on a “last-mile” wireless network connected to a distribution network built on multi-gigabit fiber optic cable. This type of cable provides bleeding-edge speed and bandwidth, unparalleled by any other transmission medium. The fiber links are leased from local/regional utilities. Building our networks over this medium provides a significant advantage over the aging cable mediums of other big telecom firms. Leasing our fiber needs removes the cost burden of installation and maintenance which limit the response time of cable-based telecom firms. Lastly, our IP-based network can deliver internet access, web hosting, digital television, Voice-over-IP, and many other services over a shared medium. With low incremental cost, Wisp Networks can provide quality value-added services to secure further sources of revenue that other pure internet service providers cannot access.</p>
<p class=""05BodyText"">In future growth, Wisp Networks hopes to use its hybrid network design to enter rural and micropolitan markets. The wireless medium can provide high-speed access to areas that may not have been reached by other technologies because they are too expensive or too far away to be profitable relative to the size of the client base.</p>

<h2><strong>BarSential's Vision:</strong></h2>
<p>Bars have always offered special promotions to bring people through their doors.  The problem is how they notify their customers about these promotions.  Currently, bars rely on social media posts and word-of-mouth promotions.  This means that to find the best deal on a given night, people would have to search multiple venue pages on Facebook or try and talk with a busy bartender.  We simplify this process by placing all the nearby promotions on a single platform.</p>
<p><strong>Enter, BarSential, a simple mobile app that allows consumers to purchase and redeem offers from their phone.</strong></p>
<p>With BarSential, consumers gain access to discounts on popular nightlife items including drinks, bottle service, admission and food.  Merchants are able to signup on <a href=""http://BarSential.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://BarSential.com</a> and, once approved, can immediately start publishing offers in real time to the BarSential smartphone application, engaging their target customer.  We focus on successful promotions that will increase revenue and clientele for these businesses. </p>

Freedom
Genie is an application for your iPhone/Android that helps protect your rights
when in a situation where you are being detained and or questioned by a member
of law enforcement or any other government agency.
The Freedom Genie floats on your background as a “widget” with instant access to the Freedom Genie Dashboard. Once you are confronted by law enforcement, simply follow the situation setup wizard and the Freedom Genie does the rest.
(SITUATION)
YOU WERE JUST PULLED OVER BY A CHP OFFICER AND HE WONT GIVE YOU A DIRECT ANSWER AS TO WHY HE PULLED YOU OVER! 


LUCKY YOU! THE OFFICER DOESN'T KNOW YOU ACTIVATED FREEDOM GENIE SOON AS YOU WERE PULLED OVER!

Activating the Freedom Genie:

1.  Upon
activation your cell phone will be locked via Freedom Genie.
2.  Freedom
Genie will automatically log your GPS location and record it to Freedom Genie.
3.  Freedom
Genie then turns your phone into a live broadcasting video camera streaming the
whole incident via Youtube, U-stream, or Freedom Genie servers aka ""Magic Lamps"".
If no internet is available the video will be compressed and hidden inside the
Freedom Genie encrypted folder also requiring a PIN#. Audio will be automatically recorded if live stream isn't available.
4.  Freedom
Genie then sends email notifications to your lawyer, spouse, family, etc., stating you are either being detained or questioned by law enforcement. E-mails
will contain links to live stream, GPS location, times and dates.
5.  Freedom
Genie will then keep your phone safe and secure until you wish it back to
normal.
6.  If you are about to be wrongfully searched and/or detained, or you simply just feel threatened just push and hold the Panic Button and Freedom Genie sends an URGENT alert out to whomever you may have in your emergency contact list.



Customize Settings!

1. Customize your possible threat menu with preloaded agencies such as police, CHP, state troopers, FBI, CIA, DHS, etc., and other agencies pertaining to local jurisdiction. Also customize special events such as DUI checkpoints, NWO/TSA security checkpoints and border inspections.
2. Customize your notify list! You can program your Freedom Genie to e-mail and/or SMS text your Emergency Contacts; this includes, spouse, family, lawyer, client, agent.
3. Customize your phone to Beacon Announcement Alert via speakerphone ""This citizen is protected by Freedom Genie! For the safety of both parties this incident is being filmed and streamed live online. Also note that this citizen has requested his or her family and legal representatives be contacted upon activating this program. Thank you for fair treatment and upholding all constitutional rights of this citizen.""



Funding and Distribution
The complexity of this app and all of the unique functions I would like it to perform are costly! There is an estimated base cost of $4k to $6k to design the program for both Apple and Android platforms. A database would have to be built to accommodate subscription customers and private customers with a private server to stream and store their videos if they would not like to use public services such as Ustream. In addition we need funding for technical support to work out the bugs during beta-testing, and for marketing the app once it is launched.

And wouldn't Freedom Genie's live video broadcasting prevent the crooks (ahem... cops) from destroying the evidence by destroying your phone? The answer is YES!



Once in a while a person gets lucky and films such chaos as is seen in the video above; but what about those who weren't so lucky? As we grow closer and closer to becoming a police state, we are continually losing more and more of our rights. Stop being a victim and take steps to protect yourself.

<h2>About the NMCs</h2>
<p><span>Connectors are faced with a multitude of problems. They can wear down over time, suffer losses in signal and are susceptible to water damage. With the Non-Mating Connector (NMC) (patent pending), we seek to avoid this. This new design in connectors, which we are first implementing on USB (with our first application with USB flash drives), is a way around this as it is completely sealed in a polymer. It has proven to outperform standard USB and is completely waterproof due to the lack of exposed ohmic contacts, eliminating the connector as a means of entry for water. When connectors are implemented in this manner, any portable consumer electronics device that uses NMC connectors will be waterproof.</span></p>
<p>USB connectors are widely used. This is one of the reasons why this application was chosen first. </p>

<p><span>NMC USB Standard B-Connectors</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Our NMC connectors work by using electric fields between metal plates (that are insulated) rather than metal-to-metal wire contacts to transmit data signals. NMC engineers have also developed a way to transmit USB power, so the NMC connectors will be fully functional USB connectors. </span></p>
<p><span>We had usability in mind when designing these connectors. NMC connectors also get rid of the use of standard mechanical latches that mechanically hold the two connector parts together. We wanted to remove the gradual wear with mechanical latches, so we designed one with a magnet that won't wear down over time. The magnets, therefore, hold the two connectors in place instead of the mechanical latches. This concept is similar to the design used in Apple's power connectors. The application of the NMC is not limited to the USB connector, and we hope to develop applications inside of all mobile electronics soon.</span></p>

</div></div>","Who are we?
My name is Pete Melhuish, of The Portable Office Company (POC), and I'd like to tell you a little bit about our fantastic new Virtual Desktop...
With a committed team of cloud wizards, we have been working long and hard on this project for 3 years. We are now in a position to launch our desktop into the marketplace, to let you the consumer decide if we have hit the right spot! By opening it up to Indegogo users (you cannot put a price on early adopters), we hope this question will be answered, and you will love this product as much as we do!

Why we need your help
In a nutshell, we are looking for £7K of funding to refresh our website and hone our Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) plans, in preperation for pressing the 'GO' button in March 2013. To show you how much your help and support means to us, we wanted to offer you a little something in return as a BIG thank you...
 
Here's the deal...
 
By making a contribution you will receive a HUGE saving on what will be our opening market price for this product. Coupled with the fact that our desktop means you will NEVER have to update your software or centralise your storage EVER again! Just out of curiosity, what have you got to lose? 

A big THANK YOU
Thanks for taking the time to look over our project. I am sure it will become evident that POC is one of the coolest and most cost effective ways to use genuine Microsoft software on any device! Moving forward it is also one of the best ways to stay at the forefront of computing. By carefully managing the interaction of the end user, our online Windows desktop increases the
relevance and quality of the service provided to you.
 
By utilising new revenue streams and smarter infrastructure design, we have been able to price our desktop considerably lower than other similar products on the market. This means that even with the most basic understanding of computers, you are able to create your own multi-user networked business environment at a fraction of the cost. Better still, being virtual means we keep the software up to date for you!

<h2>A short introduction</h2>
<p>Two Dutch entrepreneurs, pleasantly insane, incredibly ambitious and only separated by the pacific ocean, who are building a multilingual global platform to offer 3D Printed customizable cases. And that's just the beginning. Koen is running our offices in Hong Kong and is responsible for production. Last year Vincent moved to San Francisco to focus on sales and E-Commerce! It all started when Koen couldn't find a nice case for his HTC Sensation. <strong>Only one year later and we are running this IndieGoGo campaign!<br/></strong></p>
<p><img alt=""Koen Munneke, Vincent van de Poll, Co-Founders UCreate3D"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i47.tinypic.com/t5ps41.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""2 Co-Founders, 1 Mission""/></p>
<h2>Only available for 1 brand? BORING!</h2>
<p>The best things should be available for everyone. Every time new case designs or concepts are introduced one thing is certain, it will only be available for the iPhone, iPad and if you’re lucky Samsung. If you are the proud owner of an HTC, Blackberry, Nokia, LG, a Sony, tough luck. You will end up keeping your precious device “safe” in an old sock (we’ve all been there) or a one-size-fits-all sleeve. All this is history! <strong>U</strong>Create<strong>3D creates awesome cases for every available <strong>Smartphone and tablet</strong> device on the market! </strong></p>

<p>Cases for the first 20 devices will be ready this summer, but depending on your support we could do even more! If your device is not on the list below, don’t be alarmed. We continually add more devices to our assortment. If you are thinking of buying a new Smartphone or tablet and you want to support us, no problem. All new models by the established brands will be available. If Apple releases the iPhone 6 we will be the first to offer a customizable case! <strong>Our cases will be available to everyone for every device!</strong></p>

<h2>Create your own design!</h2>
<p>Do you want to express yourself through your phone and tablet case? Do you like adding a personal touch to your device? That’s an expensive hobby! Well actually, it WAS an expensive hobby. What makes our concept truly unique in the field of 3D Printing, are the switchable panels. You can create new cases for your device, or just create a new panel.</p>

<h2>Our cases aren’t just art</h2>
<p>We are as passionate and obsessed about quality as we are about the freedom of choice. Most 3D Printed products are not used on a daily basis. A piece of art like that isn’t meant to go in and out of pockets all day long, exposed to bright sunlight and sweaty palms.Today’s 3D Printing techniques are not capable of making products that can withstand these daily challenges. In contrast, <strong>our products have been developed especially for daily usage.</strong></p>
<p><strong><img alt=""Real 3D Printed Cases for iPhone 5"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i47.tinypic.com/oa3n12.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Real 3D Printed Cases for iPhone 5""/></strong></p>
<h2>The highest quality on the market</h2>
<p>That’s why 3D Printed cases require a different, special approach, developed especially for smartphones cases. That’s what we’ve done! We developed a new way of applying our protective coating to withstand all these daily challenges and keep our cases looking brand new. We have worked with the best painting, finishing and case experts to develop our unique way of protecting the case. We have painted sample after sample, with different combinations of paints and coating, until we found our magical mix and were completely satisfied with the end result.</p>
<p><img alt=""Both cases were red, see the difference after usage"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i49.tinypic.com/oq97gm.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Both cases were red, see the difference after usage""/><em>Left: Our</em> <em>case with special coating. Right: Competitors case. Both after 1 month of usage.</em></p>
<h2>The secret is:</h2>
<p>After 3D Printing your case we apply multiple layers of paint, the base coat, and a strong high end coating, which originates from the car industry. This multiple layer finishing technique dramatically increases the durability of our cases. Without these layers, your 3D Printed creation would soak up fluids, dirt, and all the things that we encounter every day. We want to make sure that your piece of art stays safe! We were amazed by the quality when we held the case for the first time and we are sure that you’ll feel the same way. <strong>Our products have the highest quality of all 3D Printed Cases on the market!</strong></p>

<p>Our cases are the perfect gift! Buy a sixpack and you don't have to worry about presents for the coming 6 birthdays!</p>

<h2>Always wanted to be a Super Hero?</h2>
<p>This is your chance to become ours! If you have real super powers (super strength, lightning, spider sense, etc.), please use them to help kickstart our full production process. A large initial order (300+) will help us to scale up, cut costs, improve quality and expand the range of devices. The first cases for four devices are already done. If you are a mere mortal, like us, you can be a great help by backing us so we can develop our webshop and designs for the other 16 devices. <strong>With your support we could be shipping the first cases to all of you in June 2013!</strong></p>
<p><img alt=""Superman!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i48.tinypic.com/2094zl4.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""You can support us without revealing your true identity!""/></p>
<h2>Where will the money go?</h2>
<p>So far we have financed UCreate3D ourselves, and we have been able to develop the first devices and proof of our concept. But now it’s time to take the next step and we need your support! We are using our IndieGoGo campaign in three ways.</p>
<h3>1. Webshop</h3>
<p>Developing an easy to use web shop isn’t cheap, especially when you want to do it right. We expect our fully functional webshop to be ready in June 2013. <strong>IndieGoGo backers</strong>: <strong>YOU are going to be the first</strong> <strong>to create your very own 3D Printed Case.</strong></p>
<h3>2. Designs</h3>
<p>We will deliver on our promise to develop designs for the 16 other devices. With 20 models we will have the most devices of any 3D printing company. <strong>And this is just the beginning. We’ll keep an adding more!</strong></p>
<h3>3. Pre-Orders</h3>
<p>The more cases pre-ordered during this campaign the more we can spread our costs and the faster we can develop more cases and design, have more colors and designs available, and the better our web shop will be! <strong>So...</strong></p>
<h2>Please Pledge &amp; Spread the word!</h2>
<p>We hope that you are inspired and excited about 3D Printing, by the idea of creating your own Smartphone or tablet case and choose to use your superpowers to support our project. You can also help us by spreading the word to your friends. <strong>Every Tweet, Like and Pledge brings us closer to realizing our dream.</strong></p>
<h2>
<strong>$30,000 Stretch Goal: </strong>UCreate3D’s Draw-a-thon!</h2>
<p>Everyone can design a creative, fun, artistic case with or without a computer. Old schoolers, whip out your black markers! Fellow computer nerds, fire up Photoshop and Illustrator and let’s get ready to rumble! </p>
<p>On April 25th we will then make a selection of the coolest 10 designs. Then you will be able to vote on which one you like most. The three most popular will be made into 3D models for <strong>ALL</strong> Smartphones &amp; Tablets by our designers and listed on our web shop! <strong>We are only able to do this is we reach the $30,000 mark</strong>, so start designing and spreading the words to get your cases on devices worldwide.</p>
<p>You can order the winning designs for your case.</p>

<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p><img alt=""It all started here"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i45.tinypic.com/9gkjye.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;"" title=""Astrid, Vincent, Eva, Nathalie, ROSA (logo), Yuna, Koen, Irene &amp; Maikel (Camera Crew)""/>Koen and I go way back! We met 12 years ago in Amsterdam through a mutual friend, Rosa (pink hat). We named our logo after her, there is no visual resemblance! UCreate3D was founded in 2012 after a skiing trip with a group of friends in France. We spent the whole week talking about 3D Printing, E-Commerce and entrepreneurship. We got excited about 3D Printing and the impact it will have on everything imaginable. For instance on the case market, availability for all devices and freedom in designing them. When we looked at Koens case, we knew what to do. He finally could have a high quality personalized case for his HTC Sensation. Not much later we founded UCreate3D and started developing our case concept you are looking at right now.  </p>

<p>So far we have financed UCreate3D ourselves, and we have been able to develop the first devices and proof of our concept. But now it’s time to take the next step and we need your support! We are using our IndieGoGo campaign in three ways.</p>
<h3>1. Webshop</h3>
<p>The past couple of months we've worked with an amazing team to develop our webshop. Developing an easy to use web shop isn’t cheap, especially when you want to do it right. Vincent worked 4 years at one of the most successful web shops in Europe, and has successfully launched and managed a multilingual webshop. We expect our fully functional webshop to be ready in June 2013. We will launch our webshop, for IndieGoGo backers only of course. You are going to be the first to choose your device, use your creativity and create your very own 3D Printed  case.</p>
<p><strong>You</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Choose your device</li>
<li>Add your favorite quote or upload a logo or an image</li>
<li>Add your name or company name</li>
<li>Choose colors for the case and the back panels</li>
</ol>
<p> <strong>UCreate3D</strong></p>
<p>      5. 3D Prints the case<br/>      6. Finishes the case <br/>      7. Packages and ships it</p>
<h3> 2. Creating the designs</h3>
<p>We will continue developing designs for the 15 devices we’ve promised. We want to deliver on the promise: all Smartphones and tablets. With 20 devices we will offer the most devices of all 3D Printing companies. It takes high skilled engineers hours and hours and a couple of runs of 3D printing samples and adjusting to get a perfect case. We will use the money to buy our own paint and coating, which will be applied by experts to ensure the quality.</p>
<h3>Focus on quality</h3>
<p>Koen is the head of our Hong Kong Office. He has been going in and out of China to build a strong personal relationship with our manufacturers. Its vital to have a team and one of the two founders on the ground in China to be on top of the production process. To ensure quality and eliminate or minimize delays. All to make sure that the designs that you create and see on your screen will be converted flawlessly into final products. During this process we’ve learned a lot and have become very selective when it comes to choosing our partners.</p>
<h3>3. Pre-Orders</h3>
<p>The more cases will be pre-ordered during this campaign the easier our work gets. We can spread our costs; develop even more cases; have more colors and designs available, and the webshop will be even more awesome!</p>

You can still order
If you have missed our campaign, you don't have to worry. You can still (pre-order) a case on www.UCreate3D.com. Our IndieGoGo backers will receive their case first, but you could be customizing your case directly after them!

A short introduction
Two Dutch entrepreneurs, pleasantly insane, incredibly ambitious and only separated by the pacific ocean, who are building a multilingual global platform to offer 3D Printed customizable cases. And that's just the beginning. Koen is running our offices in Hong Kong and is responsible for production. Last year Vincent moved to San Francisco to focus on sales and E-Commerce! It all started when Koen couldn't find a nice case for his HTC Sensation. Only one year later and we are running this IndieGoGo campaign!

Only available for 1 brand? BORING!
The best things should be available for everyone. Every time new case designs or concepts are introduced one thing is certain, it will only be available for the iPhone, iPad and if you’re lucky Samsung. If you are the proud owner of an HTC, Blackberry, Nokia, LG, a Sony, tough luck. You will end up keeping your precious device “safe” in an old sock (we’ve all been there) or a one-size-fits-all sleeve. All this is history! UCreate3D creates awesome cases for every available Smartphone and tablet device on the market! 

We´ll keep on adding devices!

Cases for the first 20 devices will be ready this summer, but depending on your support we could do even more! If your device is not on the list below, don’t be alarmed. We continually add more devices to our assortment. If you are thinking of buying a new Smartphone or tablet and you want to support us, no problem. All new models by the established brands will be available. If Apple releases the iPhone 6 we will be the first to offer a customizable case! Our cases will be available to everyone for every device!

Create your own design!
Do you want to express yourself through your phone and tablet case? Do you like adding a personal touch to your device? That’s an expensive hobby! Well actually, it WAS an expensive hobby. What makes our concept truly unique in the field of 3D Printing, are the switchable panels. You can create new cases for your device, or just create a new panel.
Available in 11 colors, +1

Our cases and panels will be available in: Batman Black,  Ron Burgundy Red, Deep Blue, Rex Green, Artic White & Sterling Silver; Juicy Orange, District Red, Go Green, Caribbean Blue, Pretty in Pink & Color #12
Whether you want to change your back cover to:

Match your mood, dress or outfit.

Support your favorite sports team because they won the World Series (Go Giants!!!).
Become the best boyfriend ever by surprising your girlfriend for Valentine’s Day.
Become the favorite uncle by giving a case for your cousins birthday.
Promote your company (or ours).
Make your most loyal customers or employees even more loyal.
Have your favorite brand (UCreate3D of course) or TV show on it.
Show your secret identity (or not)


The possibilities are endless. Just design a new panel on our website and we will print it just for you!

You can customize your device, to infinity and beyond! 
The best thing is, it's very easy to design your case with our online customization software! In only 4 steps you can customize you case. 
You can design your own case in June!
Our cases aren’t just art
We are as passionate and obsessed about quality as we are about the freedom of choice. Most 3D Printed products are not used on a daily basis. A piece of art like that isn’t meant to go in and out of pockets all day long, exposed to bright sunlight and sweaty palms.Today’s 3D Printing techniques are not capable of making products that can withstand these daily challenges. In contrast, our products have been developed especially for daily usage.

The highest quality on the market
That’s why 3D Printed cases require a different, special approach, developed especially for smartphones cases. That’s what we’ve done! We developed a new way of applying our protective coating to withstand all these daily challenges and keep our cases looking brand new. We have worked with the best painting, finishing and case experts to develop our unique way of protecting the case. We have painted sample after sample, with different combinations of paints and coating, until we found our magical mix and were completely satisfied with the end result.
Left: Our case with special coating. Right: Competitors case. Both after 1 month of usage.
The secret is:
After 3D Printing your case we apply multiple layers of paint, the base coat, and a strong high end coating, which originates from the car industry. This multiple layer finishing technique dramatically increases the durability of our cases. Without these layers, your 3D Printed creation would soak up fluids, dirt, and all the things that we encounter every day. We want to make sure that your piece of art stays safe! We were amazed by the quality when we held the case for the first time and we are sure that you’ll feel the same way. Our products have the highest quality of all 3D Printed Cases on the market!

Giftcards are available! 

Our cases are the perfect gift! Buy a sixpack and you don't have to worry about presents for the coming 6 birthdays!

Always wanted to be a Super Hero?
This is your chance to become ours! If you have real super powers (super strength, lightning, spider sense, etc.), please use them to help kickstart our full production process. A large initial order (300+) will help us to scale up, cut costs, improve quality and expand the range of devices. The first cases for four devices are already done. If you are a mere mortal, like us, you can be a great help by backing us so we can develop our webshop and designs for the other 16 devices. With your support we could be shipping the first cases to all of you in June 2013!

Where will the money go?
So far we have financed UCreate3D ourselves, and we have been able to develop the first devices and proof of our concept. But now it’s time to take the next step and we need your support! We are using our IndieGoGo campaign in three ways.
1. Webshop
Developing an easy to use web shop isn’t cheap, especially when you want to do it right. We expect our fully functional webshop to be ready in June 2013. IndieGoGo backers: YOU are going to be the first to create your very own 3D Printed Case.
2. Designs
We will deliver on our promise to develop designs for the 16 other devices. With 20 models we will have the most devices of any 3D printing company. And this is just the beginning. We’ll keep an adding more!
3. Pre-Orders
The more cases pre-ordered during this campaign the more we can spread our costs and the faster we can develop more cases and design, have more colors and designs available, and the better our web shop will be! So...
Please Pledge & Spread the word!
We hope that you are inspired and excited about 3D Printing, by the idea of creating your own Smartphone or tablet case and choose to use your superpowers to support our project. You can also help us by spreading the word to your friends. Every Tweet, Like and Pledge brings us closer to realizing our dream.

$30,000 Stretch Goal: UCreate3D’s Draw-a-thon!
Everyone can design a creative, fun, artistic case with or without a computer. Old schoolers, whip out your black markers! Fellow computer nerds, fire up Photoshop and Illustrator and let’s get ready to rumble! 
On April 25th we will then make a selection of the coolest 10 designs. Then you will be able to vote on which one you like most. The three most popular will be made into 3D models for ALL Smartphones & Tablets by our designers and listed on our web shop! We are only able to do this is we reach the $30,000 mark, so start designing and spreading the words to get your cases on devices worldwide.
You can order the winning designs for your case.

Our Story
Koen and I go way back! We met 12 years ago in Amsterdam through a mutual friend, Rosa (pink hat). We named our logo after her, there is no visual resemblance! UCreate3D was founded in 2012 after a skiing trip with a group of friends in France. We spent the whole week talking about 3D Printing, E-Commerce and entrepreneurship. We got excited about 3D Printing and the impact it will have on everything imaginable. For instance on the case market, availability for all devices and freedom in designing them. When we looked at Koens case, we knew what to do. He finally could have a high quality personalized case for his HTC Sensation. Not much later we founded UCreate3D and started developing our case concept you are looking at right now.  
 
 
We will do everything in our power to fulfill your expectations and we hope you will support us to realize our dream.
Thanks for checking out (y)our project and supporting us so we can realize our dream.
Vincent, Koen and the rest of the UCreate3D team.

Tiny Low Cost Linux Embedded Computer with WiFi and Ethernet Low Heat AWM002 kit
Customize your IoT(Internet of Things) Now! 
 Why pay $15 for a WiFi module to attach to your embedded
CPU? Why not use a module that runs Linux and WiFi in the same chip for $15?
AWM002 is a module based on the Ralink
RT5350with 32MB of RAM and 8MB of
flash, Ethernet and 802.11N
support too.
This is not a hard to program embbed
system, it is full Linux. Hook up a serial port or use SSH and you have the
normal Linux command line. Run a web server. 
Hook up a printer on USB. Plug in a Zwave USB module. This is full Linux
minus the screen.  It runs OpenWRT - www.openwrt.orgMany developers want to use a WiFi devices to do monitoring, communicating, even surveillance. What kind of IC and modules are needed with most effective and low cost? This module is included MIPS CPU 380MHz and WiFi functions, also Linux Embedded. It runs OpenWRT. Support is already in OpenWRT, and passed FCC (ID: TKZAWM002), CE. After 5 times modifications reaches the low operating temperature. The module size is 25mm x 35mm with 40 pins out.

Beelance API
Beelance API is a major stretch goal to extend the beelance into an open source community with extensions. Our first planned Beelance extension using Beelance API is the Hotel Management API
What will beelance API let developers do?
-Allows Developers to use features of beelance and build upon that a customized suite
-For example the Hotel management API will allow the hotel which uses beelance to manage their project in their completely custom app. This means they can add and extend features according to their need. And also connect to hardware like CCTV, Lights, Electronics, Hardware Devices, e-keys and manage them on Beelance. The possibilities with beelance API is endless
-Add additional features to your office on beelance according to requirements
-Complete Design Customization Of UI. You can build custom UIs for your beelance office suite according to requirements.
-Connect to Devices and hardware. Allowing home/office automation and much more. Giving Master control etc

Risks & Challenges
The main risks and challenges are as follows

3rd party services used in development may cause security and privacyproblems
File security and confidentiality from hackers

How we will solve these issues?


We will minimize use of 3rd arty applications on the website, The more funded the more we can rely less on 3rd party services
We will host in 100% https SSL protected secure servers
Encryption for files and data
Internet Heart bleed Protection

What happens if we are not completely funded?

We will still complete the project but at a delay, as we need to find alternatives for funds and development. 
The more we are funded, We will rely less on 3rd party applications like Google and Skype and will also cover more platforms. As development costs are high, our first priority is to complete the web application, then Tablet version, followed by mobile versions.


Other Ways You Can Help

Background</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>I lead a small team
developing our flagship product TopXNotes. TopXNotes was first introduced at
Macworld in 2005 and has been under constant use and active development since
then. TopXNotes has been presented to over 100 Mac User Groups across the

<p>Please help me continue
the development of TopXNotes. We need your help in order to complete and
release version 2.0 of TopXNotes. Current sales of TopXNotes are not enough to
fund future development. We need to raise $50,000 to continue development

<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>An Introduction
to TopXNotes</b></p>
<p>TopXNotes is a hybrid <u>Personal
Information Organizer</u> (PIO) and information security app. TopXNotes has many unique features.
One TopXNotes feature is MultiView, that offers the benefit of being able to
display and edit more than one note at a time simultaneously. As far as we know
no other program can do this on Mac or PC. Part of MultiView technology is
another benefit, its distinctive sliding text toolbar that is always above where
you are typing. This too is in no other program that we know about. TopXNotes
has many other benefits you can read about. Click below to take the tour of
TopXNotes: (<a href=""http://www.tropic4.com/topxnotes.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.tropic4.com/topxnotes.html</a>).</p>
<p><b>How  We View TopXNotes</b></p>
<p>Here is a short description of how we feel about
TopXNotes:</p>
<p><b>You do not need a
note or task manager that takes more time to learn than its intended
purpose.  You need a simple, easy to learn, easy to use personal note, password
and task manager.</b></p>
<p><b>Information
management should not be your full time job, it should help you do your job or
complete tasks. TopXNotes will put your mind at ease by helping you create,
view, organize, and instantly access your important information and much more.
You can read about the “much more” in the many good reviews referenced on our
website and in TopXNotes extensive built-in Help.</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">TopXNotes 2.0</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>If you already have TopXNotes you are familiar
with TopXNotes extensive benefits for organizing and securing your notes. With TopXNotes
2 you will continue to receive these benefits plus new features with a very
similar user interface.  When you get TopXNotes 2, you should be able to
use it immediately as the user interface will be improved, but little will be
changed in the basic way it works. So if you are already using TopXNotes, most
of your knowledge of TopXNotes 1 will enable you to get right to work with
TopXNotes 2. Here is an example of TopXNotes 2 development, a MultiView of 5 notes and the NoteOrganizer each note view showing pictures in notes, running on the latest Mac OS X 10.11, El Capitan:</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444067841/mjfqtjspvwy2mac3iy7y.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We consider many of the 2.0 features nearly
guaranteed since they are already partly implemented or completed features. As
noted above, we have completed basic development of QuickNotes 2.0, improved notes (pictures in notes, many new drag &amp; drop options), basic view note in separate window,  stronger (AES 256) encryption, improved WiFi sync, an improved NoteOrganizer (many new drag &amp; drop options), and
ToDo Notes. (TopXNotes “ToDo Notes” is a new concept, which marries the power
of TopXNotes with a unique ToDo implementation.) The remaining features will
depend on the time we have to complete the work, and that depends on the
funding. </p>
<p>The final feature set for TopXNotes 2.0 will
depend on the time available for development and not everything will be in
TopXNotes 2.0. We anticipate a 2.1 and other releases. </p>

</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Why</b> <b>Indiegogo?</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>For some of you this may be your first exposure to
Indiegogo, a marvelous operation that, as Indiegogo states “empowers people to
activate the global community to make ideas happen.” According to Wikipedia (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiegogo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiegogo</a>), Indiegogo was founded in
2008 as one of the first sites to offer crowd funding. Indiegogo allows people
to solicit funds for an idea, charity or start-up business. From Indiegogo’s
research, they have found people fund ideas they can be passionate about and
people they trust. We hope to assure you that we are passionate about notes,
about getting you organized on your Mac, and can be trusted to deliver
TopXNotes 2.0.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Our Personal Commitment</b></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Many Mac note products have been created in the past, so
I can understand how you might wonder why anyone would want to do it again.
Creating a better Mac notepad was not too hard when we started, but creating a
sophisticated, feature-rich, personal information organizer with our unique
dual-level encryption and multiple view architecture was a huge project with
many facets and lots of testing to be sure data was safe. </p>
<p>For me, TopXNotes has been and remains a
compelling project filled with challenging problems. TopXNotes started as a
simple extension of some consulting I had done down in south Florida. I gained
some knowledge of Apple's text system and realized it would be easy to make a
notepad with many fancy text options like one sees in Microsoft Word, Apple's
Pages and TextEdit. But as TopXNotes progressed, I realized it could be very
valuable as a place to collect all the little bits of information scattered
across my Mac's many “nooks and crannies,"" in multiple formats, to get
them all centralized in one place, and to create the QuickNotes system for easy
access from the Mac desktop. So, TopXNotes evolved from just one more simple
notepad into a powerful note organizer—a note organizer worth paying for. </p>
<p>Steve Jobs liked the expression “we eat our
own dog food” to explain how Apple used its own development tools and other
products as they were being developed to be sure they were the best they could
be. We have always used TopXNotes during its development for planning, bug
lists, proposed feature lists, call agendas, and many other tasks.</p>
<p>TopXNotes has always been popular with the
Apple/Mac User Groups, and it did briefly make it into the Apple physical
stores before it was bumped (along with many other boxes of Mac software) to
make room for iPad accessories.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>However, I have now reached a point where
TopXNotes has to pay its way. TopXNotes is not a one-person business, but
almost. I take care of some of the development and most of everything else
(support, website, marketing, sales) and now, crowd funding. I have a very
small crew of dedicated developers helping me with TopXNotes. Supporting
TopXNotes is to support me, my family, and our small development team. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">If you want to you can read a bit more about Tropical Software (<a href=""http://www.tropic4.com/about.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.tropic4.com/about.html</a>), about our team (<a href=""http://www.tropic4.com/team.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.tropic4.com/team.html</a>) and the background for this crowd funding campaign.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q and A</b></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>What happens after the funded period if the goal
is reached?</p>

will be enough to continue full time development. If not, then I might create a

Q and A


What happens after the funded period if the goal
is reached?
Ideally, the regular daily sales of TopXNotes 2.0
will be enough to continue full time development. If not, then I might create a
new crowd funding campaign.
What happens if the goal is not reached?
This also depends on the daily regular sales. I
will continue to support existing users, but my primary occupation might be
something other than TopXNotes.

Print and distribute a minimum of 100,000 leaflet advertising the debate

Book and pay for a large, open, and accessible venue in the City Centre


Publicise the debate in print, electronic and social media


Hire equipment for the event, including PA and video equipment

No money will be wasted, and any surplus will be used to support and promote local campaign across the city in the remaining six months of the campaign.Like the rest of the Yes campaign, we are a volunteer, grassroots organisation, reliant on donations to support events like this.  If you can, please donate what you can.  No amount is too small or too big to help..Thanks.Yes Glasgow",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","because we needed a better tool

We work on graphic design, video editing or CAD on a daily basis. Keyboard and mouse are great, but they are far from giving you the same sensitivity and abilities as your hand. 
The same applies to music, browsing or presentations. We need a tool that gives us flexible shortcuts and perfect control, a tool that makes the things we love fast, precise, intuitive and fun. That's why we created a freely programmable wireless controller.
""Why Senic's controller is important for designers and creatives""
by Garry Tan, Partner Y Combinator
 ""How we built it""
by Team Senic on Medium (44,000 Views)


Made for your hand
The best of three worlds






We've tried out many tools. We liked some functions; others not so much.


With the controller, we combined three technologies in a way that suits the needs of those who work and live like we do.


Hand gesture recognition, sensitive touch and precise haptics make it the perfect tool for anyone who wants to work, play and create in the digital world.




For your computer
Dozens of controls out of the box






We have already developed controls for more than 30 of the most popular applications. Week by week, you will see more controls which means that your controller will  evolve over time. Your intuition is our roadmap.

Let us know which shortcuts or controls are important to you and we'll get right to work. 


For your smart devices
Home should feel like home




We love smart homes. We backed some of the earliest smart devices and love them. The problem is that controlling them with your smartphone is not a great experience. Read more: ""Smartphone ≠ smart home""We wanted a simple device that gave us natural and instant access to our smart lights and speakers.



Use Cases
Make it your own























Better Control
through Haptics, Precision and Speed









 


Fits into your life
""By design""









The best tools never get noticed.
We aim to make our controller beautiful in its functional complexity yet inconspicuous in your environment. 
It seamlessly fits into your lives. Therefore, Senic's controller had to be portable and simple to use. 







Tech Specs

Design meets technology













Connectivity
Works with your devices you already own











It connects directly to anything that speaks Bluetooth Low Energy with no additional hardware required. 


We'll start off by supporting Mac, then add support for iOS devices, Android, Linux and Windows. We're making progress fast and we'll keep you posted along the way.





Setup

Personalize your controller









Choose between hundreds of setups and create your own personal controls and shortcuts. You'll be able to access your settings through an intuitive web interface. We can add mobile apps as well.
 

Open Platform
Create your own applications






Senic's controller's speciality is the combination of hardware and software and the possibilities this uncovers. We built it on an open platform, so developers can build even more applications. It is possible to implement custom shortcuts as well as Apple Script. 








Our team grew up immersed around tools and raw materials. Our parents are carpenters, engineers and electricians. 


It is fascinating and inspiring to watch how unconsciously they use their tools and the beauty and quality that results from using them.


Why can't interaction with the digital world feel the same way? 




We experimented extensively in our quest to combine the physical and digital worlds. Our dream is to live in an ecosystem where technology naturally blends into our lives, allowing us to analyze, control and create in a fluid fashion. 



This controller is the first major step towards this goal and you are the ones who will enable it. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you so much. We promise to work harder and smarter than we can imagine.

Design Process
We care about details















 ""Good design is as little design as possible: less, but better - because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with non-essentials. Back to purity, back to simplicity."" - Dieter Rams

We're using some of the latest technologies from material sciences, prototyping and electronics to build our controller and went through dozens of iterations until we were satisfied with a design, both functionally and aesthetically.


Made Locally

Support local manufacturing










We are proponents of local manufacturing. Why? Because you can only build quality products if you're in close proximity with your manufacturers and suppliers.
We're witnessing tremendous changes in the way products are and will be manufactured. This evolution has allowed products to be made locally. We have to be willing to explore the opportunities and lead by example. 
We're happy to share our entire process with you. There is true beauty in craftsmanship giving birth to appreciation for skills and quality. 






Cost
Where your money goes







Initial costs for hardware products are very high. Prices drop with larger quantities but costs like production tooling and certification are big hurdles for startups.

Have you ever wondered what the CE and FCC symbols on the back of your electronics products stand for? They certify that the products are safe to use. In order to produce the controller, we have to go through many tests from electromagnetic compatibility to safety tests. That costs a lot of money. 


Therein lies the essence of crowdfunding. You help small teams like us to build something which would otherwise be impossible to make. Thank you so much!

<p>Two years ago, we decided to expand our original mission of helping people after they have had a neurologic injury to developing devices that can help prevent those injuries in the first place. Did you know that not exercising may be as bad for you as smoking cigarettes?! Check out this time magazine article (<a href=""http://healthland.time.com/2012/07/18/lack-of-exercise-as-deadly-as-smoking-study-finds/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://healthland.time.com/2012/07/18/lack-of-exercise-as-deadly-as-smoking-study-finds/</a>).</p>
<p>And its no surprise that we don't exercise as much as we should. Most of us sit all day at work looking at a screen, and when we go home we either have no time for exercise or are too tired to do anything but lounge on the couch and watch TV. Because of this, we wanted to create an exercise tool that people can use while they are going about their daily lives. We sit for an average of 8 hours per day, so why not put those sitting hours to better use?</p>
<b>Our Search For the Perfect Cycle.</b> We realized that most stationary, under the desk-type cycles out there were antiquated, broke easily, and were unattractive. So we started from scratch by making a cycle that people could get excited about. </div>

<p><b>Production and Fulfillment Plan:</b></p>
<p>We want to be perfectly transparent with you every step of the way. Here’s some information on how we will be turning this product from our current prototype to a product that you can hold in your hands. Production and fulfillment will be handled in a three step process.</p>
<p><b>Step 1: Manufacturing</b> Printed circuit board (PCB) fabrication, PCB assembly, and injection molding will all be handled through NOA Labs. This manufacturing firm has a proven track record. They have worked with giants such as BMW and Airbus as well as countless small businesses and start-ups. We have worked with them on several successful projects. The company is ready to produce up to 50,000 units per month and quoted us a lead time of 45-60 days for production. Shipment will take another 45-60 days. We received small sample runs of both the electronics and the housing and they look great! </p>
<p><b>Step 2: Assembly.</b> We will begin assembly the same day the units arrive from NOA labs. During the assembly process, will will perform a functional test to make sure everything is in working order. We will then package this item in the supplied retail box. This process is expected to take between 15-30 days depending on the number of orders.</p>
<p><b>Step 3: Fulfillment. </b>We partnered with a local fulfillment center that is ready to ship out all the units. This process will take 5-10 days. It will take an additional 5-15 days for USPS to get the item to your door. We will push as hard as humanly possible to get Cycli to your doorstep!</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Risks and challenges</h4>
<p>We’ve worked hard to minimize the risks associated with Cycli. The product has already gone through several design/prototyping stages and beta tests with target users. We are officially ready to manufacture. We have qualified our manufacturers and first-level fulfillment partners. If we can raise enough funds, we are confident that we can ship the product in time for our customers to be using Cycli before the holiday season. We have verified prototype level manufacturing, but we need large orders to bring the manufacturing costs down to an affordable level.</p>
<p>If setbacks occur, we will contact our customers to keep them informed of possible delays. If orders are slow to arrive, we will ship to customers in order that they committed funds.</p>

</div></div>","Cycli turns exercise into a social experience. Cycli is the world's first Bluetooth enabled portable cycle that lets you race against your office buddies, your grandma, your dodgeball team, your city, or even the whole world. Just put Cycli under your office desk or in front of your couch and start cycling. Cycli will track all your data like reps/calories burned and send it to your iPhone or Android (think FitBit while you're sitting).



And here's where it gets social... In addition to tracking how much you exercise, Cycli let's you compete against other people in public or private groups. Simply join a group with your family, your coworkers, or even your Facebook friends and see how well you stack up against everyone else!
  










IOT meets fitness. Join the community.  We all know it's easier to stick to a fitness goal if you're not doing it by yourself. The Cycli app connects you to every other Cycli user so that the whole world can be your exercise buddy.


Exercise any time, with anyone. We all have our excuses. The gym is intimidating. Your workout buddy just moved out of state. You like playing video games. You just had a baby. We get it. We made Cycli for you. 





The portable cycle. Reinvented. Cycli is packed with tons of features that you literally cannot find on any other portable cycle. Patents pending. 




Meet the brains of the operation. We built all the electronics from scratch to handle and store all the metrics from your exercise and, most importantly, to wirelessly transfer data to your phone through a BLE connection.




Take Cycli anywhere! With its sleek, compact design, you can put Cycli under your desk, in front of your couch, or beside your bed. We guarantee Cycli won't become another drying rack like that giant treadmill in the corner.



Large 46mm LCD touchscreen shows you important metrics like calories burned, time spent exercising, and number of reps. Just tap the screen to scroll through the metrics. You can even use your foot! The screen automatically turns on when you start cycling.




Cycli uses a high quality magnetic resistance mechanism that provides a wide range of resistance levels. Need an easy workout? Turn the resistance knob to Level 1. Are you a fitness junkie that wants to feel the burn? Turn the resistance knob to Level 8. Cycli's magnetic resistance also provides smooth and quiet operation so you won't bug your office mates.




Did you know that most (if not all) other portable cycles are giving you a very ""rough"" estimate of calories burned? That's because they do not factor in the resistance level. We gave Cycli a proprietary smart sensor that measures the resistance level (1-8) and uses it to give you a much more accurate measurement of how many calories you've burned.




Being connected isn't always a good thing. Especially when it's to the wall. That's why we added a large lithium polymer battery that can run for days without charging. When you need a boost, simply plug Cycli in to any outlet (charger included)!





Cycli is built on a high quality steel and aluminum foundation. That means that Cycli will be able to handle all your aggression on Monday morning, and it won't slide around while you're pedaling away.






We have spent the last 7 years building tools to get people moving again. At our roots, we are passionate about using technology in innovative ways to empower people to lead healthier and happier lives. Our first products were geared towards helping people with stroke, brain injury, and Spinal Cord injury to recover using music and technology. You can learn more at www.flintrehab.com




Two years ago, we decided to expand our original mission of helping people after they have had a neurologic injury to developing devices that can help prevent those injuries in the first place. Did you know that not exercising may be as bad for you as smoking cigarettes?!

debt and economic slavery.A day when we can all be financially free and independent, be our own bosses and work on our own time.I long for the day we can all work together and exchange our valuable assets without the need for money or traditional jobs.When the world realizes we already have what we need if we just use what we have.That day has come and I have the solution!I have already began offering a phone service for anyone to receive UNLIMITED talk, texts and internet on their phones..This unlimited flow of service never ends.You never have to pay another phone bill!Freeing your phone or tablet is great, but...How about complete financial freedom?I believe we should all be financially free and independent.If we shared our resources, time and energy we could live free from debt, and therefore free from economic slavery...I've developed an extremely complex universal exchange system that includes its own currency that is used within it.I'm talking about an entirely new digital currency that can be earned, exchanged, gifted, sent, received, bought and sold even at bulk discounted prices.So you can buy low and profit from the money itself!!!But that's not all...This currency would operate differently from fiat currencies that we are used to...THE PROBLEM AND THE SOLUTIONUS dollars are nothing more than reserve notes which are basically overly glorified IOU's exchanged for bonds created by banks, so they are actually DEBT.The privately owned corporation known as the Federal Reserve gives banks these bills in exchange for a promise of debt paid, which is impossible.THERE ISN'T ENOUGH MONEY IN EXISTENCE TO PAY THE DEBT ""WE"" OWEThe banks also charge interest, making the amount of debt even higher.The money we use isn't backed by gold or silver and the more money that gets created, the more value it steals from the money already in existence.DEBT = MONEY & MONEY = DEBTIf there was no money, there'd be no debt!So the way this currency would work is it would be created as value is recognized.In other words, wherever there is money to be made, it IS made out of thin air...But this money will be debt-free and backed by the time and energy or value that created it in the first place.TIME IS MONEY. EVERYTHING IS ENERGYOur time and energy are the most valuable and important things we have in our lives.All that exists is just energy, vibrating in the void we call nonexistence.What we think we know and what we perceive is nothing more than an illusion.We are meant to evolve and become more advanced.We are meant to become so much more than this.Our world is being governed and monopolized by bankers and privately owned corporate entities.These entities control our resources and keep us from advancing and living healthier, wealthier and happier lifestyles in order to oppress us, make disgustingly huge amounts of money and to do their best at keeping us from under their boot.There are endless inventions that could have revolutionized us and made life a million times easier.Some examples being clean, free renewable energy,Debt free money (Lincoln's Greenbacks)Free phone serviceCars that run on air, solar and waterCryptocurrencies Jet packsHologramsTeleportationWireless electricityLive satellite feedsAnd much moreThese advancements have been quietly shut down and covered up.Many of the inventors persecuted, imprisoned and even killed.Some of these things are attainable today but the average person can't afford them.So it's clear that we are being held back but why? I ALREADY TOLD YOU...MONEY!!!It's time to take back our value and make our own money complete with an entirely new system.This new financial system will always capitalize on itself, automatically making our time and energy even more valuable. The value of this currency will always naturally increase the more it exchanged.This new system will operate on credits that are created and backed by real value.These credits can be exchanged for any other world currencies, other peoples time, services, products and virtually anything else on and off the internet, instantly...So no more having to wait 3-5 days for your money to move to/from your bank ;)I have been working on the structure and model for this startup for over 8 years now and have had time to brainstorm ideas with others and put the pieces together to create something that has the potential to completely change the world and  also free humanity from economic slavery...I plan to use the majority of this money to develop apps that enable anyone to share and exchange virtually anything at any time using this currency from anywhere.This would allow people from all walks of life to be financially independent and make a great living doing what they want to do on their own set times. Everyone has talents and other valuable assets they can offer the world, this platform would enable you others who are interested in putting these assets to use, do so, effortlessly and anonymously.I also plan to add a service like uber or lyft giving free and discounted rides to people who don't have transportation to and from any local exchanges that would require it.Not only that, I plan to provide a service where multiple people can invest in products, projects or anything else and work together to share their profits.This would make it effortless for people with great ideas or who are just looking for others to help with a project or with starting a new business to do so and connect with one another in an easy and secure way. Now we can take action and create and share ideas, products and valuable resources, step by step and reap the rewards much faster than traditional methods.This Will revolutionalize crowd funding!I am also adding an affiliate marketing feature that enables anyone to suggest any valuable asset posted in the marketplace and get paid for conversions.So not only do you get paid for selling your assets, you'll get a cut of others as well.Not only that...Anyone will be able to easily earn these credits by completing tasks, joining projects and just being actively involved.The possibilities are truly endless...EXCHANGE CREDITS FOR ANYTHINGCredits are completely interchangeable!Whatever you want and need will be at your fingertips in our asset marketplace.Including both physical and virtual gift cards to all of the stores you go to most!CUSTOMIZE AND PRINT YOUR MONEY!One of the coolest features I'm excited to add is the ability to customize, print and exchange your own money with QR codes.This is great for personal and professional advertisement and enables exchanges in person.

school? Have you ever forgotten your charger in your car, office, hotel room, or 
need a charger when you've been out and about or at your favorite coffee 
shop? Perhaps you are just tired of carrying oddly shaped 
chargers and bulky wires in your pocket. If you said yes to any of these scenarios, then Volt Buckle is for you! Volt Buckle makes these worries a thing of the past.
<p>Volt Buckle stands alone in product features when compared to other 
wall chargers and docking devices. Volt Buckle lets you charge, sync,

 any USB product that needs power! </li>

ensure that you will always have your charger with you. </p><p><b><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/018/611/5c764abee2d63d8cfe0497dc6c196e1e_large.jpg?1338964383"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p><strong>Volt Buckle - The Story Behind the Product</strong>
<p>Volt Buckle came to fruition after realizing that men typically have 
only their pockets to carry mobile device chargers and all the 
associated wires that come along with them. After trying to match 
numerous existing chargers to buckles, a match was finally found. After 
some genuine, old-fashioned blood, sweat and tears, and hours pounding 
metal in the garage, the original prototype Volt Buckle was born.</p>
<p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>Original Volt Buckle Prototype</b></p>
<p><b><img alt=""Original Volt Buckle Prototype"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/015/472/cc8fbdc0fa687ef496f54ce3b2fd0817_large.jpg?1338783281"" src="""" style=""""/></b>Building off of this working proof of concept, the CaliBuilt Team 
went to the experts. Some of the best and brightest electrical, 
mechanical, and 3D design professionals in California's Bay Area came 
together to custom design the charger and buckle using the latest and 
most advanced tools. The result is the alpha-prototype that we are 
presenting to you here on Indiegogo! The Volt Buckle chargers that you 
see here on our Indiegogo site (thanks for giving us a look!) are samples from our overseas manufacturer. </p>
<p><strong>Volt Buckle - Where are we in the Process? </strong></p><p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/018/526/b602e0f0915a569aa49d2fac36d872c5_large.jpg?1338960309"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Volt Buckle is ready to sell! The funding that we seek here with the help of the Indiegogo 
community will fund the final minor engineering, and most importantly, 
will allow us to pay back the manufacturer for the molds to produce the charger case, and part 
for the Volt Sync Connector. Your charger will be made of custom molded 
ABS and will have a sleek, stylish appearance.</p>Your support will also, of course, pay for the parts and labor to 
create the Volt Buckles ordered by the Indiegogo community, and 
hopefully a few more for an initial inventory to roll-out the product to
 the general public.

do too! Helping us reach our funding goal will let us take Volt Buckle 
to the next level. We are appreciative and receptive to your feedback, 
so who knows, maybe your idea will be incorporated into Volt Buckle 
version 2.0!</p>
<p>With funding, we anticipate future versions of Volt Buckle to feature:</p>
<ul>
<li>a back-up battery. We designed Volt Buckle with the possibility of 
incorporating a back-up battery capable of providing 30-60 minutes of 
power for your mobile device, even if you are not near an outlet!</li>
<li>a design geared towards professionals that allows the wearer to pop a
 discretely designed charger out of the buckle without disengaging the 
belt in any manner.</li>
<li>an endless variety of customizable colors, designs, and styles. The 
buckle as well as the belt provides a virtually limitless platform to 
express your creativity, style, and taste.</li>

Volt Buckle - FAQ
</b><br/><br/>Q: What size belt do I order if I am waist size X?<br/><br/>A: The belt that comes with your Volt Buckle is custom designed, and 
we have endeavored to accommodate the widest range of waist sizes as 
possible. Unfortunately, we may not be able to fit all waists until 
later in development. Our initial production run will accommodate waist 
sizes from 30 inches to 42 inches, and we will contact you directly at the conclusion of the campaing to obtain your sizing information,
 in addition to which sync connector you would like (USB to mini USB, 
USB to micro USB, USB to Apple 40 pin, or USB to Lightning iPhone 
connector.)<br/><br/><p>Q: Will my pants stay up if I'm using the Volt Buckle?</p>
<p>A: Yes! We have specially designed the Patent Pending belt that comes
 with your Volt Buckle to securely latch so your pants stay up when Volt
 Buckle is providing you the power that you need.</p>
<p>Q: Is Volt Buckle 220V compatible?</p>
<p>A: No. Volt Buckle currently provides 2 amps at 110 volts, which 
means Volt Buckle works out of the box in North America, e.g. the United
 States, Canada and Mexico. Depending on the level of funding achieved, 
Volt Buckle may look to go international very quickly! <br/></p><p>Q: Is there a women's version? <br/></p><p>
A: At this time, there is no specific women's version; however, the 
belt goes well in casual situations and fits well with jeans, so there 
is nothing preventing women from wearing the belt. We have some ideas in
 development specifically for women! Help fund the development of a 
women's version by donating to Volt Buckle version 1.0.</p><p>Q: My mobile device's charger input is on the side. Will Volt Buckle still work for me?</p>
<p>A: Yes. Volt Buckle will charge your device; however, for best 
performance when docked, we recommend that the charger input be either 
on the top or the bottom of the device. With your funding we are 
devising a solution so that all mobile devices will be able to be docked
 when charging.</p>
<p>Q: What about the new iPhone 5 connector?</p>
<p>A: Volt Buckle is Lightning Connector compatible.</p>
<p>*Volt Buckle will charge any Apple, or USB connective device. It may not properly dock large items such as the iPad.</p><b>

THANK YOU TO THE INDIEGOGO COMMUNITY!</b><br/><br/><p>The CaliBuilt team sincerely appreciates you taking the time to check

Volt Buckle as we are. Any amount you can contribute brings us that much
 closer to making our dream a reality, and we are truly grateful for all

World
Have you been stranded at work without your charger? Without your charger at the airport? At 
school? Have you ever forgotten your charger in your car, office, hotel room, or 
need a charger when you've been out and about or at your favorite coffee 
shop? Perhaps you are just tired of carrying oddly shaped 
chargers and bulky wires in your pocket. If you said yes to any of these scenarios, then Volt Buckle is for you! Volt Buckle makes these worries a thing of the past.
Volt Buckle stands alone in product features when compared to other 
wall chargers and docking devices. Volt Buckle lets you charge, sync, 
and dock* all in one convenient, sleek, and fashionable device that fits
 comfortably around your waist. 

Volt Buckle is a USB product, so it charges a wide variety of mobile
 devices such as iPhones, most Androids, and iPads. Volt Buckle could be 
adapted in the future for use with gaming devices, cameras, or virtually
 any USB product that needs power! 
Volt Buckle provides sync capability. Sync and charge your device 
with one convenient product without bulky charger cases and wires.
Volt Buckle seamlessly integrates into your wardrobe for convenient 
portability. No more bulky chargers or ""rat's nest"" of wires in your 
pocket.
Volt Buckle provides peace of mind knowing that you will never forget your charger in your car or leave it behind at home!
Whether you are a traveler on the go, a student, need your mobile device for 
work, or just an avid device user, Volt Buckle will 
ensure that you will always have your charger with you. Volt Buckle - The Story Behind the Product
Volt Buckle came to fruition after realizing that men typically have 
only their pockets to carry mobile device chargers and all the 
associated wires that come along with them. After trying to match 
numerous existing chargers to buckles, a match was finally found. After 
some genuine, old-fashioned blood, sweat and tears, and hours pounding 
metal in the garage, the original prototype Volt Buckle was born.
Original Volt Buckle Prototype
Building off of this working proof of concept, the CaliBuilt Team 
went to the experts. Some of the best and brightest electrical, 
mechanical, and 3D design professionals in California's Bay Area came 
together to custom design the charger and buckle using the latest and 
most advanced tools. The result is the alpha-prototype that we are 
presenting to you here on Indiegogo! The Volt Buckle chargers that you 
see here on our Indiegogo site (thanks for giving us a look!) are samples from our overseas manufacturer. 
Volt Buckle - Where are we in the Process? Volt Buckle is ready to sell! The funding that we seek here with the help of the Indiegogo 
community will fund the final minor engineering, and most importantly, 
will allow us to pay back the manufacturer for the molds to produce the charger case, and part 
for the Volt Sync Connector. Your charger will be made of custom molded 
ABS and will have a sleek, stylish appearance.Your support will also, of course, pay for the parts and labor to 
create the Volt Buckles ordered by the Indiegogo community, and 
hopefully a few more for an initial inventory to roll-out the product to
 the general public.
Volt Buckle - Where are we going? We think Volt Buckle is awesome as it currently is, and we hope you 
do too! Helping us reach our funding goal will let us take Volt Buckle 
to the next level. We are appreciative and receptive to your feedback, 
so who knows, maybe your idea will be incorporated into Volt Buckle 
version 2.0!
With funding, we anticipate future versions of Volt Buckle to feature:

a back-up battery. We designed Volt Buckle with the possibility of 
incorporating a back-up battery capable of providing 30-60 minutes of 
power for your mobile device, even if you are not near an outlet!
a design geared towards professionals that allows the wearer to pop a
 discretely designed charger out of the buckle without disengaging the 
belt in any manner.
an endless variety of customizable colors, designs, and styles. The 
buckle as well as the belt provides a virtually limitless platform to 
express your creativity, style, and taste.


Volt Buckle - FAQ
Q: What size belt do I order if I am waist size X?A: The belt that comes with your Volt Buckle is custom designed, and 
we have endeavored to accommodate the widest range of waist sizes as 
possible. Unfortunately, we may not be able to fit all waists until 
later in development. Our initial production run will accommodate waist 
sizes from 30 inches to 42 inches, and we will contact you directly at the conclusion of the campaing to obtain your sizing information,
 in addition to which sync connector you would like (USB to mini USB, 
USB to micro USB, USB to Apple 40 pin, or USB to Lightning iPhone 
connector.)Q: Will my pants stay up if I'm using the Volt Buckle?
A: Yes! We have specially designed the Patent Pending belt that comes
 with your Volt Buckle to securely latch so your pants stay up when Volt
 Buckle is providing you the power that you need.
Q: Is Volt Buckle 220V compatible?
A: No. Volt Buckle currently provides 2 amps at 110 volts, which 
means Volt Buckle works out of the box in North America, e.g. the United
 States, Canada and Mexico. Depending on the level of funding achieved, 
Volt Buckle may look to go international very quickly! Q: Is there a women's version? 
A: At this time, there is no specific women's version; however, the 
belt goes well in casual situations and fits well with jeans, so there 
is nothing preventing women from wearing the belt. We have some ideas in
 development specifically for women! Help fund the development of a 
women's version by donating to Volt Buckle version 1.0.Q: My mobile device's charger input is on the side. Will Volt Buckle still work for me?
A: Yes. Volt Buckle will charge your device; however, for best 
performance when docked, we recommend that the charger input be either 
on the top or the bottom of the device. With your funding we are 
devising a solution so that all mobile devices will be able to be docked
 when charging.
Q: What about the new iPhone 5 connector?
A: Volt Buckle is Lightning Connector compatible.
*Volt Buckle will charge any Apple, or USB connective device. It may not properly dock large items such as the iPad.

THANK YOU TO THE INDIEGOGO COMMUNITY!The CaliBuilt team sincerely appreciates you taking the time to check
 out our project. We hope the Indiegogo community is as excited about 
Volt Buckle as we are. Any amount you can contribute brings us that much
 closer to making our dream a reality, and we are truly grateful for all
 contributions to our project. We strive to be responsive to comments 
and feedback to the greatest extent possible.",6.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h1>iSmile's story</h1>
</div><span><div>
<span><br/></span>At the very beginning, we realised that people were difficult to snap selfies by the timer of their phones. So, we decided to make a device that can remote control the phone to snap selfies.<br/>
</div>
<div>We think people would love to snap selfies anytime on their own or with their loved ones, therefore, we have made the iSmile in a keychain-design for people to carry around. </div>
<div>As we know, Steve Jobs believes that thin is beautiful, so we make iSmile in a thin profile to have it interpret the beauty. <br/>
</div>
<div>Right, to carry around and anywhere. People would go indoor and outdoor to snap selfies. That's why we make iSmile durable and waterproof.</div></span><div><div>
<div>
<div>Thank you for our devoted and passionated designers and engineers, without them,  this nice selfie remote would not exist.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Last but not the least - thank you for your support and appreciate iSmile. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Thank you.</div>

iSmile's story

At the very beginning, we realised that people were difficult to snap selfies by the timer of their phones. So, we decided to make a device that can remote control the phone to snap selfies.

We think people would love to snap selfies anytime on their own or with their loved ones, therefore, we have made the iSmile in a keychain-design for people to carry around. 
As we know, Steve Jobs believes that thin is beautiful, so we make iSmile in a thin profile to have it interpret the beauty. 

Right, to carry around and anywhere. People would go indoor and outdoor to snap selfies. That's why we make iSmile durable and waterproof.

Thank you for our devoted and passionated designers and engineers, without them,  this nice selfie remote would not exist.

Last but not the least - thank you for your support and appreciate iSmile. 

Thank you.

<p><b>What
is Park On The Fly?</b></p>
<p><b>Created by concerned
UF students in 2010</b>, Park on the Fly is
a massively scalable parking management system designed to make buying,
selling, and finding parking simple.  We’ve brokered over 10,000
transactions at rock bottom prices, such as $0.50/hour, $3.75/ 24 hour day, and $10/week for our fellow UF
students and residents of the city at large. 
The system allows consumers to purchase parking before leaving home,
removing the hassle of searching for an open lot.  Our clients are
property owners looking to monetize unused or not fully utilized parking or
land near high traffic areas, such as campus or downtown.  Our clients are
also individuals that want to sell their home parking spaces for special events
such as football games and day to day parking.  We are currently active at
13 locations, even 1 parking garage, and are working hard to add locations
daily, even in new cities!</p>
<p><b>How
Does It Work?</b></p>
<p>Simply go to our website and tell us
where you're going and when you're going there.  We'll show you the lots
we manage and let you buy your spot hours, days, or even weeks in advance.
 The day of your reservation just drive to the lot and park.  No
printouts necessary!  We're also currently developing our mobile app which
will allow you to find and buy parking in under 30 seconds, which reduces the
current transaction time experienced on mobile devices.  We expect to
release the app in the near future.</p>
<p><b>Who's
Running The Show?</b></p>
<p>We're all Gator Grads! We're current graduate
students, a former consultant, and a nuclear engineer supported by an amazing
programming team of local and distant talent that counts billion dollar
companies among its clients.  We believe that there is absolutely no
reason why anyone should spend twenty or thirty minutes looking for parking.</p>
<p><b>Contests
Attended And Media</b></p>
<p>We've been invited to compete in
several business competitions on behalf of UF.  You can see Sargent and
Aashish presenting at the Wake Forest Elevator Pitch competition at the top of
this page.  We qualified to present at Wake Forest after beating out
applicants all over the country.</p>
<p>We were also one of 11 student run
companies worldwide invited to present at the HKUST MBA International Business
Plan in Hong Kong.  They flew us out there to represent The University of
FL.  It was a great experience that has kept us moving on the right path.</p>
<p><b>Why
Do We Need Your Support?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Over the past 3 years we've proven the
business model and conducted a beta test.  We provide real value to people
parking, property owners, and feedback from our existing customers has been
amazing.  The next step is to expand and make the systems even more
feature rich for students and our users.  We plan to use funds raised from
this campaign to increase our user base locally by growing beyond our 10-13
locations.  This sometimes takes some capital to go along with hard
work.  The more locations we have, the
more we can get rates reduced for students beyond the $0.50/hour, $3.75/day,
$20/month, and $80/semester we already have achieved.  We've found that our biggest problem is
publicity.  When people find us, they keep using our service.  In
fact, the average user has completed over 16 transactions! </p>

</div></div>","EasyFinder is a smart battery you can use to locate your smartphone and other battery operated devices! Just pop in an EasyFinder to any battery-powered device and let EasyFinder's signal locate your smartphone using its low power Bluetooth transmitter. Unlike other smartphone trackers, EasyFinder will guide you to your phone's exact proximity, even when it is on silent!  You can also use the FREE EasyFinder app to track your battery-powered devices when you can't remember where you set them down!

You can use EasyFinder in any battery-powered device.
The EasyFinder is a low power Bluetooth transmitter that helps you locate your phone by simply substituting one of the AA or AAA batteries in your TV remote (or other battery powered device) with an EasyFinder battery.  EasyFinder technology is patent-pending!








Download the free app on your smartwatch, smartphone or tablet and you’re ready to locate your remote. The app uses radar-like guidance with an audible beeping sound from the EasyFinder device, sending you in the direction of your lost remote.



 Find Your Phone Fast Too: EasyFinder works two ways! You can locate your smartphone easily by pressing the logo on your EasyFinder battery (in your tv remote or other devices) and a signal will be sent to your phone making it ring, even if its on silent!!!!

<span>As many of you are wondering, we do not have the drone shell manufactured yet because we are still looking into what materials we want to use in order to maximize efficiency of the drone at the lowest cost possible. We are using default drone shells to do tests with just drone’s pcb board. We are planning on making the shells in China. There are two options that we can use to create the shells, injection moulding or 3D-Printing. If we decide  to use 3D-printing we will have to see how fast these drone shells can be made so they can be delivered to the customer on time. The other option of using Injection Moulding will have a much faster manufacture time although will have higher costs and lower amounts of customizability. However we are looking out for our customer’s best interest so we will update you as soon as we have some news on this. </span><br/>

<p><span>Currently we are using a standard 2.4GHz remote to control the drone. Although we have cut the antenna to the same length as the final remote, as well as other slight modifications to match the specifications of the final product. The manufacturer has agreed to make the final remote once we confirm the order. It will be made to the exact same specifications as to what we are testing the drone and statistics we have published. </span><br/></p>

<p>One day as I was watching my brother and sister-in law go crazy <strong>yet AGAIN</strong> looking for my neice's pacifier, then I had a ""light bulb moment"". Wouldn't it be great if the pacifier had a built in gps tracking device and a mobile app that would tell my brother and sister in-law where the pacifier was immediately upon opening of the app. Since I am a mobile app developer already, making the app would be simple.

One day as I was watching my brother and sister-in law go crazy yet AGAIN looking for my neice's pacifier, then I had a ""light bulb moment"". Wouldn't it be great if the pacifier had a built in gps tracking device and a mobile app that would tell my brother and sister in-law where the pacifier was immediately upon opening of the app. Since I am a mobile app developer already, making the app would be simple.

<p><b>WHAT DISPLAY ENGINES OPTIONS ARE OFFERED IN THE IRIS?</b><br/>We offer 2 different display engines: a MEMS laser scanning engine and a DLP display engine.</p>
<p><b>WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE?</b><br/>MEMS laser scanning produces an incredible crisp, vibrant full color image. When viewed at nightime, the difference is apparent when the lack of an ambient backglow makes the laser display really stand out from anything you've ever seen. Laser display engines are also incredibly expensive and for our initial campaign, we are only offering 30 units with the laser display.<br/>DLP display engines provide a bright, crisp full color image. Their performance is excellent and combined with their compact size and availability, they are an excellent choice for use in the Iris.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>HOW DOES IRIS FUNCTION?</b></p>
<p>If Iris is used without the app downloaded on your iOS or Android smartphone, it will display information from your car's computer by default such as speed, engine data, fuel consumption and more.</p>
<p>If you have downloaded the app onto your iOS or Android smartphone, you will be able to select what information you want displayed. This includes phone calls, messages, GPS and geolocation information. We will be working on expanding the range of features so your Iris improves with time.</p>
<p><b>IS PROJECTED IMAGERY VISIBLE TO ONCOMING CARS?</b></p>
<p>No. Iris display is not easily viewed by anyone other than the driver.</p>
<p><b>DOES IRIS BLOCK THE SUN IF IT IS BRIGHT?</b></p>

<p>Yes, you can decide if messages will display while you are moving or wait until your vehicle is stationary.</p>
<p><b>DOES IRIS USE VOICE RECOGNITION?</b></p>
<p>Yes. Iris allows you to compose messages, initiate phone calls and more with voice command.</p>

For about $75 you
 can replace the coil if it ever breaks. You can also buy different 
styles of coils if you prefer a flatter head, larger stalk, or different
 design.<br/><br/><b>Healthier:</b> When you dab, you are not inhaling any
 plant particulates. The vapour is clean and the material is more 
concentrated and refined. This also means that it is medically cleaner 
and more potent with less harmful side effects.<br/><br/><b>Healthier Again and Saves Money: </b>No
 butane! Instead of inhaling butane you don't have to worry about that 
with a coiled heater. And on top of it being better for your health, you
 can save on average $50 per month. So it pays for itself in no time!<br/><br/><b>Small Size: </b>The
 eNail.BUZZ is an extremely compact design making it easy to use, easy 
to store, and easy to transport. The designs in the past are completely 
inferior.<br/><br/><b>Presets: </b>Press a button, save the temperature. 
It's that simple. Save up to 6 different presets for 6 different people,
 personalities, plants, or any other reason you may think of. <br/><br/><b>Safety Auto-Shutdown: </b>Don't
 light your couch on fire and burn down your house. That would be bad. 
eNail.BUZZ is good, it saves you the trouble of remember to turn it off,
 it will do it automatically after a user configurable amount of time.<br/><br/><b>Cool-To-The-Touch Warning:</b>
 Don't touch that coil! The only product that tells you how hot the coil
 is and not to touch it, even when the product is off. Wait until it 
gets cooler before you disassemble it and pack it away. Hot coil and 
your pocket don't go well together.<br/><br/><b>Glowing State LEDs: </b>A

<p>A simple ""d-pad"" type configuration of buttons on the right side

<h1><b>Da Plan</b></h1><p>So now that you know what it is, here is the 
rest of the plan! We have working prototypes and the design is complete.
 The circuit boards have been designed, built, and tested. The firmware 
for the micro-computer has been coded, flashed, and tested. The 
enclosure has been designed in a 3D CAD tool and is ready to be 
fabricated. Essentially all the back-end design, is done.</p><p>The next
 steps involve manufacturing it. We need to order hundreds of boards and
 assemble hundreds of boards. Get machined mouldings for the plastic 
injection cases. Get boxes printed for retail locations. Website design,
 all the logistics that the customers can see. That is what this money 
goes towards. </p><p>Our plan is to make a first initial run of 250 
boards. The parts, the PCBs, the assembly, the cases, the boxes, coils, 
nails, and other costs total about $76,000 USD. This includes the NRE 
(Non-Recurring Engineering) costs for die cuts, print masks, moulds, and
 so on. We are going to have an asking MSRP in the $650 to $850 range 
which puts us in the middle end of the spectrum but with the highest end
 features and things that don't have any comparison.</p><p>We already 
have tens of units sold to a local store that will be stocking them and 
selling them at their multiple retail locations. </p><p>This is a good thing for everyone and we can't wait to revolutionize the industry. </p><h1>Summary</h1><ul>

<li>Features that nobody else has</li>

<li>Save on butane! On average $50/month!</li>
<li>Healthier! No more inhaling butane or plant particulates<br/>
</li>
</ul></div>","Quite simply, this will be the best eNail on the market and have features that no other eNail has. So what makes this thing so special?Replaceable Coil: We have to stress that the coil is replaceable. For about $75 you
 can replace the coil if it ever breaks. You can also buy different 
styles of coils if you prefer a flatter head, larger stalk, or different
 design.Healthier: When you dab, you are not inhaling any
 plant particulates. The vapour is clean and the material is more 
concentrated and refined. This also means that it is medically cleaner 
and more potent with less harmful side effects.Healthier Again and Saves Money: No
 butane! Instead of inhaling butane you don't have to worry about that 
with a coiled heater. And on top of it being better for your health, you
 can save on average $50 per month. So it pays for itself in no time!Small Size: The
 eNail.BUZZ is an extremely compact design making it easy to use, easy 
to store, and easy to transport. The designs in the past are completely 
inferior.Presets: Press a button, save the temperature. 
It's that simple. Save up to 6 different presets for 6 different people,
 personalities, plants, or any other reason you may think of. Safety Auto-Shutdown: Don't
 light your couch on fire and burn down your house. That would be bad. 
eNail.BUZZ is good, it saves you the trouble of remember to turn it off,
 it will do it automatically after a user configurable amount of time.Cool-To-The-Touch Warning:
 Don't touch that coil! The only product that tells you how hot the coil
 is and not to touch it, even when the product is off. Wait until it 
gets cooler before you disassemble it and pack it away. Hot coil and 
your pocket don't go well together.Glowing State LEDs: A 
quick glance at the glowing will tell you if the coil is off and cool, 
blue, or if it is hot and on, red. Don't guess, it is an easy colour 
coded system.Fast Heat-Up and Super Accurate: Heat up the coil in less than a minute and keep it within a degree or two of where you set it. Get the best possible burn with the best eNail ever produced.Long-Winded Version About the ProductIt
 is a small compact design that quickly heats up a coil. The coil itself

you can replace just that for less than $100. Most other solutions

<p>My name is Basheer Contractor and I am the Chief Executive Office and founder of Wireless Freedom Charge Inc,  I have developed the products and now I need a ""little"" help manufacturing the products on a large scale.  Take a look below and see what my product specifications are and what they will be sold at on my website online. The incentives you can receive from becoming a backer for WFC are huge. Getting funded would catalyze the manufacturing process and help me take large quantity orders and because of this I will be able to provide individuals who backed my company with huge savings on products. Remember this project is flexible and I generate enough capital already to make my quota for orders.  I am making amazing incentives though for any backers of this technology and you will be rewarded for your loyalty. I have been working and developing these products consistently and with all my energy for the last 3 years. </p>
<p>You are looking at game changing products that are going to cause a ripple in the ""wireless charging market"". This is the first universal wireless charging system that is completely independent from the 3 major players in the wireless charging industry (Qi,A4WP,PMA). Our products have nothing to do with the 3 wireless charging standards listed previously, this is revolutionary work and at WFC (Wireless Freedom Charge Inc.) we believe that we have the wireless charging industry in a guillotine submission ready to choke it out. </p>

My name is Basheer Contractor and I am the Chief Executive Office and founder of Wireless Freedom Charge Inc,  I have developed the products and now I need a ""little"" help manufacturing the products on a large scale.  Take a look below and see what my product specifications are and what they will be sold at on my website online. The incentives you can receive from becoming a backer for WFC are huge. Getting funded would catalyze the manufacturing process and help me take large quantity orders and because of this I will be able to provide individuals who backed my company with huge savings on products. Remember this project is flexible and I generate enough capital already to make my quota for orders.  I am making amazing incentives though for any backers of this technology and you will be rewarded for your loyalty. I have been working and developing these products consistently and with all my energy for the last 3 years. 
You are looking at game changing products that are going to cause a ripple in the ""wireless charging market"". This is the first universal wireless charging system that is completely independent from the 3 major players in the wireless charging industry (Qi,A4WP,PMA). Our products have nothing to do with the 3 wireless charging standards listed previously, this is revolutionary work and at WFC (Wireless Freedom Charge Inc.) we believe that we have the wireless charging industry in a guillotine submission ready to choke it out. 




           (Nikola Tesla )             Micro-USB port for receivers: (For Interchangeable cords)

( We designed our receivers so that they have a Micro-USB port which in turn completely eradicates any issue for compatibility between devices. Just have the proper cord for your device plug it in the micro-USB port and into your device.Your device is now ready to receive charge from one of our smart transmitters.)
               This is the Assembly Detail:

Fr = 1/ 2 pie square root(LC)

The lower the R the better the quality factor. R really represents the losses in the coil and includes the wire resistance.





radiated energy and losses due to the proximity effect (eddy currents). As the frequency increases the skin effect becomes more pronounced
and less current travels in the interior of the wire, this effectively means the resistance of the wire increases with frequency.





Based on the above formulas maximum efficiency will be obtained by:




• Maximizing coil inductances
• Maximizing frequency while taking into account skin effect, proximity effect and radiative losses
• Optimizing load resistance based on other system parameters





Summary of Key Points for Maximum System Efficiency
• High Q
• Minimize coil resistances and capacitances
• Maximize coil inductances.





















(The main goal from research was maximizing frequency while taking into account skin effect, proximity effect and minimizing radiative losses.)

• Optimizing load resistance based on other system parameters
• An efficient driver such as a class D or E
• On the device side the load resistance and the efficiency of the rectification and power regulation are important

</div>","JUST ADDED A NEW COLORFUL PERK:

This
project is about passion. Passion
for soccer and passion for developing an idea come true.
Once,
watching a soccer match with friends in a Sports Bar, we have an idea of a
unique shaped drinkware inspired in the FIFA World Cup Trophy.
We called
“Trophy-glass”, a US pint capacity (16 fl.oz./473ml) daily glassware. NO
plastics, 100% pure flint food container glass for every kids & adults
beverages, and dishwasher resistant.
We
develop a complete line of trophy-glasses for every fan desire:

Flint
glass (undecorated).
Coloured
glass (undecorated)
2014
official Emblems and Logos decoration, flint-glass
Collectable
Set of 8 trophy-glasses with the former FIFA World Cup™ Champion Teams

They are all official merchandising of the  2014 FIFA World Cup™ Brazil.
We love
soccer, and we love the FIFA World Cup™.
Sometimes,
we go with friends to a Stadium but most games we watch them on a Soccer Bar or
at home and twitting to friends. The unbeatable combination for us is: friends
+ soccer + beer + pizza.
We are
not alone and many families will follow the next World Cup starting in June 12th,
2014.
Many
USMNT supporters and fans are united and organized thru American Outlaws
chapter and Sam’s Army. Also every Soccer bar owner can be interested in our
trophy-glass for their sports bar as glassware or as a premium for giveaway
promotions to their fanbase clients.
If you
know a soccer fan (or a Sports Bar owner), share our project with them.
Our project
has a long roadmap, Now is time for the first production but our capital is not
enough for it minimum quantity.
So we
decide to open our project to the huge soccer community  and ask directly to them to help us
fund our first trophy-glass production.
As a
reward for your contribution, we have make several perks with different
decorations in order to satisfy every desire and feasible help. With the
trophyglass set, every contributor will receive a “First Batch Certificate”.
If you
love soccer, If you love the FIFA World Cup, you will love the Trophy-glass.
As soon
as we reach the project goal we will order the first production. We have
everything set for starting delivering the perks on the first days of February
2014.
Help us
with your contribution. You can
also help us sharing with friends that love soccer.
If we get
a overwhelming respond to our Trophy-glass project, we can add units to the
first batch without any problem. 
We have made perks for Soccer Fans as individuals, as
aTeam and  for contributors with soccer-related
businesses. 
All
contributions helps. You can add several perks according to your interest.
Drinking
glasses made of 100% pure glass are heavy.
We include
shipping to 48 contiguous States addreses but for the heavy rewards (84 to 840
lb) we consider fair to every contributor to have 3 zones within US. Please see
the map at the end for more details on States and zones. 
Rewards for Soccer Fans

Rewards for Soccer-related Businesses:
Tired with the “Happy Hour”, “2x1” or
“BOGO” ? Innovate and propose to your soccer fan clients a unique giveaway
promotion of “Draft Beer+Trophyglass” and they take it home the Trophyglass, a
2014 FIFA Official merchandising.
Everyweek there are at least 5 important
soccer matches on your screens: differentiate from other nearby competitors and
make your clients live a unique experience in your Sports Bar.
This rewards to your help is a 20 Master
Cases perk, each case with 48 trophyglasses. Total 960 trophyglasses for
selling by unit.
We can also help your Soccer Bar with
tabletent, menus and posters artworks & images. SPECIAL FOR AO CHAPTERS SOCCER BARS.
What happens if I receive a parcel that sound
like broken glasses inside ?
Don’t worry. Receive it. If by any case, the
contributor received a broken trophy-glass, we will send without any extra cost
a replacement of the broken trophy-glass so you can have your perks full &
perfect.
Is very
simple: just take a photo with your mobile upon delivery of the parcel with the
broken T-Glass, send it to: contributors@collectible-goods.com with the tracking number
or address. Allow us 7 days for delivering the replacement.

I don’t see any perk with the coloured
trophy-glass set ?
In this first batch, we want to focus in the flint-glass, decorated
& undecorated. We know that many people like the coloured glass sets and we
are going to do it for the second batch because we need an important number of
units for making them. If you want them, please send us an email (see below)
with the reference “coloured set” so we advise when we are going to
manufacture.

Which is the first batch number?
The overall minimum quantity is 100.000 units. We have the 85% funded
with our & relatives capital. We are needing the project goal: $ 27,000

Are the trophy-glass be available at Walmart,
Target , etc ?
You are not going to find it a Walmart, Target, K-mart, Sports
Authority, Dick’s SG, etc.
Major Retailer ask for a payment term that we cannot finance. As said we
have no extra capital and we believe in the benefits for customers and
manufacturers of a direct sale. After our project, maybe we launch an ecommerce
site.
 
Are inks and materials safe ?
All of
the Trophy-glass comply with the State of California OEHHA Proposition 65.
Inks used
are organic type provide by Ferro USA and are free of heavy metals. We
manufacture and decorate all our trophy-glass in a O-I Group facility (a US
based Group) formerly known as Owens-Illinois Group. They are made of 100% pure
flint food container glass.
Also all
decorations are more than 20mm from upper border so lips cannot touch them.

<p>NOT ONLY DO WE NOT NEED THIS MONEY, WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO NOT DONATE UNLESS YOU ARE SURE! We do not need this money. there is enough money in the kitty to keep us running for months. we have recieved bad press recently for making money from this, what people dont understand is that we have touched none of it. we pay the admins, and run the cost of the server, and the rest goes to a kitty we will use when donations stop! Whether you believe that or not is your choice, but thats what happens :) </p>
<p>Currently there is enough money in the kitty to last us, if the donations STOP NOW, another: 5 months.<br/><br/>AFTER DONATING, PLEASE LEAVE YOUR INGAME NAME AND PREFERRED GUN IF APPLICABLE IN THE COMMENTS TAB!!! WE CAN NOT PUT GUNS OR ANY OTHER ITEMS IN BACKPACKS!<br/><br/></p>
<p>We have been required to introduce a cost to perk changes for two reasons. one, because it takes a fair amount of time to remake a perk, and two, it is easier for us to keep track of who has what, and the extra need to keep records of how many changes have been made etc.</p>
<p><br/>you can NOT spawn with any of the following:<br/><br/>1. items in BAGS<br/><br/>2. repair equipment (tyres, fuel etc)<br/><br/>3. rpgs, satchel charges, grenades or smoke grenades<br/><br/>4. radio<br/><br/>5. bags any larger than Alice size</p>
<p>6. any form of machine gun</p>
<p><br/>IF YOU DONATE, the procedure for spawning with weapons is as such:<br/><br/>step 1; create a new character<br/><br/>step 2; once logged in, log out within 25 minutes of creating the character, and wait at the lobby for 1 minute<br/><br/>step 3; log back in, once logged in, you will have your weapons and will spawn at your vehicle location (if you have that perk)<br/><br/>step 4; if this does not work, repeat. if it still does not work, contact krauterz or mancow ingame or by email at krauterz@live.com.<br/><br/>step 5; DONATORS CAN NOT CHANGE THEIR PERKS ONCE THE ORIGINAL REQUEST HAS BEEN PROCESSED!<br/><br/>**DONATION PERK RULES**<br/><br/>*1 DO NOT TELL ANYONE THE LOCATION OF VEHICLES!<br/><br/>*2 no deliberate trolling, or exploiting. this includes using vehicles that you have not got the perk access to use<br/><br/>*3 NO SPAWN CAMPING. it is ok to sit in capitals and murder innocents, but give them a change to get out of the city first..<br/><br/>*4 NO WASTING VEHICLES. dont crash one helicopter into 8 others..<br/><br/><br/>*5 TRY NOT TO ADD TOO MANY VEHICLES TO THE GAME! take a chopper to a capital, but HIDE IT WELL. OR imobilize it.<br/><br/>*6 AND FINALLY, DONT DEATHMATCH OR SHOOT OTHERS AT PERK LOCATIONS!!! it takes up to 10 minutes to respawn there each time. please dont do it! DOING IT WILL RESULT IN A ONE DAY BAN, second warning is removal of perks for 2 days, third warning is permenant removal of perks.<br/><br/>*7 WE OFFER FULL REFUNDS FOR DONATIONS FOR ONLY 48 HOURS. AND ONLY IF PLAYER GIVES A RELIABLE REASON FOR THEIR REFUND REQUEST! THIS IS A DONATION SYSTEM! NOT A PAY TO RECEIVE SYSTEM!<br/><br/>**DONATING ACCEPTS THESE RULES. BREAKING RULES MAY RESULT IN SUSPENSION OF PERKS, REMOVAL OF PERKS AND DEPENDING ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE INCIDENT, BANS MAY BE APPLIED**<br/><br/>Short Summary<br/><br/>ZUST is the most popular Day-Z sanctuary (private hive) server currently running. Funding is running well, the server is stable and we do not need any donations. however, due to popular demand, we will be keeping this donation page up :)</p>
<p>(the reason the perks are not cheaper, is so that not too many people are running around with 50 cals ;)<br/>we just upgraded our server! its now an 8 core with HT (meaning 16 virtual cores!) 8gb of ram and almost 1gbps connection!<br/><br/><br/>What We Need &amp; What You Get<br/>Realisticly, all we need is one months worth of funding, which is $460. ($169 for the server and $300 to hire 3 full time RDC admins) however, the more we collect, the better this server will become. more money means more slots, better uptime and less lag. granted, at the moment we are not looking to expand, but any excess money made gets added to a kitty, which will be used in the event that donations stop :)<br/><br/><br/>QUIRKS INCLUDE WEAPONS AND VEHICLES! depending on how much you donate, we can set you up with weapons, and other items. if you donate a lot, we can even make you spawn at a bunch of Hueys, littlebirds and MI-17's. If we do not reach our goal of $460, no big problem, money will be taken from the kitty to pay for the server until funding is at its target once again.<br/><br/>The Impact<br/>You will be securing ZUST's future in the world of Day-Z. This includes standalone, and many many months, if not years to come.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Other Ways You Can Help<br/>If you cant donate, dont worry, just like us on facebook! and of course feel free to connect to our server to talk directly to an admin!</p>
<p>connect to our TeamSpeak and just talk to us! we like to make new friends :)</p></div>","**IMPORTANT**

IF YOU DONATE, the procedure for spawning with weapons is as such:step 1; create a new characterstep 2; once logged in, log out within 25 minutes of creating the character, and wait at the lobby for 1 minutestep 3; log back in, once logged in, you will have your weapons and will spawn at your vehicle location (if you have that perk)step 4; if this does not work, repeat. if it still does not work, contact krauterz or mancow ingame or by email at krauterz@live.com.step 5; DONATORS CAN NOT CHANGE THEIR PERKS ONCE THE ORIGINAL REQUEST HAS BEEN PROCESSED!**DONATION PERK RULES***1 DO NOT TELL ANYONE THE LOCATION OF VEHICLES!*2 no deliberate trolling, or exploiting. this includes using vehicles that you have not got the perk access to use*3 NO SPAWN CAMPING. it is ok to sit in capitals and murder innocents, but give them a change to get out of the city first..*4 NO WASTING VEHICLES. dont crash one helicopter into 8 others..*5 TRY NOT TO ADD TOO MANY VEHICLES TO THE GAME! take a chopper to a capital, but HIDE IT WELL. OR imobilize it.*6 AND FINALLY, DONT DEATHMATCH OR SHOOT OTHERS AT PERK LOCATIONS!!! it takes up to 10 minutes to respawn there each time. please dont do it! DOING IT WILL RESULT IN A ONE DAY BAN, second warning is removal of perks for 2 days, third warning is permenant removal of perks.*7 WE OFFER FULL REFUNDS FOR DONATIONS FOR ONLY 48 HOURS. AND ONLY IF PLAYER GIVES A RELIABLE REASON FOR THEIR REFUND REQUEST! THIS IS A DONATION SYSTEM! NOT A PAY TO RECEIVE SYSTEM!**DONATING ACCEPTS THESE RULES. BREAKING RULES MAY RESULT IN SUSPENSION OF PERKS, REMOVAL OF PERKS AND DEPENDING ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE INCIDENT, BANS MAY BE APPLIED**Short SummaryZUST is the most popular Day-Z sanctuary (private hive) server currently running. Funding is running well, the server is stable and we do not need any donations. however, due to popular demand, we will be keeping this donation page up :)
(the reason the perks are not cheaper, is so that not too many people are running around with 50 cals ;)we just upgraded our server! its now an 8 core with HT (meaning 16 virtual cores!) 8gb of ram and almost 1gbps connection!What We Need & What You GetRealisticly, all we need is one months worth of funding, which is $460. ($169 for the server and $300 to hire 3 full time RDC admins) however, the more we collect, the better this server will become. more money means more slots, better uptime and less lag. granted, at the moment we are not looking to expand, but any excess money made gets added to a kitty, which will be used in the event that donations stop :)QUIRKS INCLUDE WEAPONS AND VEHICLES! depending on how much you donate, we can set you up with weapons, and other items. if you donate a lot, we can even make you spawn at a bunch of Hueys, littlebirds and MI-17's. If we do not reach our goal of $460, no big problem, money will be taken from the kitty to pay for the server until funding is at its target once again.The ImpactYou will be securing ZUST's future in the world of Day-Z. This includes standalone, and many many months, if not years to come.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you cant donate, dont worry, just like us on facebook! and of course feel free to connect to our server to talk directly to an admin!
connect to our TeamSpeak and just talk to us! we like to make new friends :)",0.0,0,"12 Campaigns

Funding has ended,  If you have missed the campaign, please head over to our website poweruptoys.com  and explore our POWERUP 4.0  bundles collection. 
You can also pick up a kit on amazon.com HERE
 

 
 
POWERUP 4.0 is the smartest, most intuitive paper plane kit we’ve ever made. It makes it possible to fly with ease and smoothness in a variety of conditions.  
Say goodbye to nosedives and choppy flights. We’ve added a new on-board flight computer and 2 new sensors: gyro and accelerometer, combined with 2 thrust vectoring motors. That means flying POWERUP 4.0 is smoother than ever, and can now do all this: 
  That’s right. POWERUP 4.0 can auto-loop. So you can master tricks and awesome aerobatics by simply pressing a button.   We’ve added 2 high speed motors to POWERUP 4.0. That means you’ve got double the thrust, additional maneuvering possibilities, and sharper turns. And together with the flight assist, you can fly just about anything   Now you can learn to fly like a pro. We’re showing you real-time analytics including heading direction, thrust level and turning angles.   We’ve made it a lot easier and way cooler to fly POWERUP 4.0 at night. Optional LED lights will enable you to light up the night - making for awesome visuals and round-the-clock fun.  2 rear wheels and 1 front wheel give your paper plane more style and make for easier takeoff and landing. They also make it possible to launch off of a surface rather than hand-launching.  
We partnered with the best RC hobby vloggers on the planet – FliteTest! They have put together their incredibly creative minds to develop a foam jet inspired by the F22 for the 4.0. It is made from a special laser cut foam board they created and make in the USA. 
Intuitive control makes it easy to fly. Simply tilt your phone in the direction you want your plane to fly. It’s really that easy.  
 
  
 
Thanks to 3 super successful Kickstarter campaigns,400K+ happy customers, and more than $3.5 million in funding, we decided to bring you a new and improved paper airplane kit to add to your collection.Shai Goitein - pilot, industrial designer, CEO and founder - decided it was time to level up again. So we listened to feedback from our POWERUP 3.0, POWERUP FPV and POWERUP Dart users, and made this the most powerful, most intuitive, and overall best version yet. Our brand new Autopilot Assist feature makes every flight a smooth one-- even in bad conditions. Real-time analytics help you become a better pilot, and two high speed motors mean you can get super creative with your plane designs. We’ve even added optional LED lights so you can fly at night.POWERUP 4.0 is breaking paper plane barriers, and we’re excited to share this badass edition with you all.  POWERUP is an incredibly helpful tool when it comes to teaching and learning aeronautics. Students can test multiple designs, analyze their work and improve their planes. Through trial and error, they can understand what makes their plane fly smoother, longer and farther- key lessons in airplane design.

<p><strong>About Us</strong></p>
<p>We are a small group of techies, media makers and community organizers whose mission is to increase access to mobile telecommunications to the over 2 billion people without affordable coverage and the 700 million with none at all. We work as a bridge between the potential users of the technology and the engineers and developers of these efforts to ensure the technology is deployed and appropriate for use in the developing world.</p>
<p>Rhizomatica started as a way to bring together resources and promote the application of new and novel telecommunications technologies to real-world problems. Our first project was the first ""real-world"" deployment of the Serval mobile ad-hoc network software to facilitate communications amongst human rights defenders in the Niger Delta area of Nigeria (see:<a href=""http://www.mediaforjusticenigeria.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""url"">mediaforjusticenigeria.org</span></a>).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Summary and Background</strong></p>
<p>According to the ITU, 2-3 billion people around the world lack affordable mobile telephone services that facilitate critical communications and access to information. Due to market saturation in developed countries and economic disincentive in the developing world and especially rural areas, mobile coverage proliferation is slowing dramatically worldwide. And yet most telecom regulations forbid the provision of strictly rural service, effectively killing any chance for micro-telco’s to thrive.</p>
<p><br/>Currently, only very large, powerful companies have access to the mobile spectrum and the concessions to provide cellular service. But their business model and the technology that these traditional providers use have proven unable to solve the problem of connecting much of the world. We want to break this oligopoly and allow communities to become service providers as well.</p>
<p><br/>Thanks to a variety of open-source efforts developed in the last few years, it has become technologically and economically feasible for a community or an individual to provide carrier-grade cellular service to thousands of people. Yet no one has so far applied these technologies in the real-world, much less created the needed regulatory reforms or community-appropriate business models. This project has a parallel component that is seeking to develop the legal/regulatory space and secure access to the necessary frequencies to foment the growth of community, rural and micro-telco's.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>We are now trying to build the first independent GSM (cell phone) network in Mexico, in the state of Oaxaca. The initial part of the project has been demonstrated using OpenBTS software and a low-power test radio (USRP), and has been presented to village assemblies and groups throughout the state, especially in rural and indigenous communities. However, the test equipment we are using has limitations and cannot be deployed as a real-world solution.</p>
<p>This requires an initial investment in hardware, specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>a GSM Base Station.</li>
<li>A 2W power amplifier.</li>
<li>Cables and antenna.</li>
<li>A PC on which to run the network management software.</li>
</ul>
<p>In case we don't reach the required amount to buy all the equipment, we will try anyway to buy as much as possible and cover the remaining expenses in other ways. </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>We are trying to create the first community-owned and operated GSM network in the world (as far as we know). If the project succeeds, we have a number of communities and municipalities interested in investing and setting up networks and generally moving towards making low-cost, reliable networks a reality anywhere. It could also mean a totally different and revolutionary approach to mobile networks in the near future – one that ensures the freedom to communicate and uses telecommunication technology as it was meant to be from the beginning: a way to help people talk to each other.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>If you can't support us directly with money, there are still many ways to help out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spread the word! The more people know about what we are up to, the better.</li>
<li>Think about possible uses for a community-operated network, and tell us about it.</li>
<li>If you are aware of similar projects, based on GSM technology, please tell us where they are. If you are part of it, share your experience with us. We are still trying to figure out all the details and possibilities, and similar experiences from other people are always welcome.</li>
<li>We are going to write software, documentation, test equipment, and a million other things. If you are interested in any of these, get in contact with us!</li>

About Us
We are a small group of techies, media makers and community organizers whose mission is to increase access to mobile telecommunications to the over 2 billion people without affordable coverage and the 700 million with none at all. We work as a bridge between the potential users of the technology and the engineers and developers of these efforts to ensure the technology is deployed and appropriate for use in the developing world.
Rhizomatica started as a way to bring together resources and promote the application of new and novel telecommunications technologies to real-world problems. Our first project was the first ""real-world"" deployment of the Serval mobile ad-hoc network software to facilitate communications amongst human rights defenders in the Niger Delta area of Nigeria (see:mediaforjusticenigeria.org).
 
Summary and Background
According to the ITU, 2-3 billion people around the world lack affordable mobile telephone services that facilitate critical communications and access to information. Due to market saturation in developed countries and economic disincentive in the developing world and especially rural areas, mobile coverage proliferation is slowing dramatically worldwide. And yet most telecom regulations forbid the provision of strictly rural service, effectively killing any chance for micro-telco’s to thrive.
Currently, only very large, powerful companies have access to the mobile spectrum and the concessions to provide cellular service. But their business model and the technology that these traditional providers use have proven unable to solve the problem of connecting much of the world. We want to break this oligopoly and allow communities to become service providers as well.
Thanks to a variety of open-source efforts developed in the last few years, it has become technologically and economically feasible for a community or an individual to provide carrier-grade cellular service to thousands of people. Yet no one has so far applied these technologies in the real-world, much less created the needed regulatory reforms or community-appropriate business models. This project has a parallel component that is seeking to develop the legal/regulatory space and secure access to the necessary frequencies to foment the growth of community, rural and micro-telco's.
 
What We Need
We are now trying to build the first independent GSM (cell phone) network in Mexico, in the state of Oaxaca. The initial part of the project has been demonstrated using OpenBTS software and a low-power test radio (USRP), and has been presented to village assemblies and groups throughout the state, especially in rural and indigenous communities. However, the test equipment we are using has limitations and cannot be deployed as a real-world solution.
This requires an initial investment in hardware, specifically:

a GSM Base Station.
A 2W power amplifier.
Cables and antenna.
A PC on which to run the network management software.

In case we don't reach the required amount to buy all the equipment, we will try anyway to buy as much as possible and cover the remaining expenses in other ways. 
 
The Impact
We are trying to create the first community-owned and operated GSM network in the world (as far as we know). If the project succeeds, we have a number of communities and municipalities interested in investing and setting up networks and generally moving towards making low-cost, reliable networks a reality anywhere. It could also mean a totally different and revolutionary approach to mobile networks in the near future – one that ensures the freedom to communicate and uses telecommunication technology as it was meant to be from the beginning: a way to help people talk to each other.
 
Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't support us directly with money, there are still many ways to help out:

Spread the word! The more people know about what we are up to, the better.
Think about possible uses for a community-operated network, and tell us about it.
If you are aware of similar projects, based on GSM technology, please tell us where they are. If you are part of it, share your experience with us. We are still trying to figure out all the details and possibilities, and similar experiences from other people are always welcome.
We are going to write software, documentation, test equipment, and a million other things. If you are interested in any of these, get in contact with us!

Somos un pequeño grupo de tecnologistas, comunicadores y promotores comunitarios quienes estamos trabajando para aumentar el acceso a las telecomunicaciones móviles para los más de 2 mil millones de personas sin cobertura asequible y los 700 millones sin ningún cobertura en absoluto. Trabajamos como un puente entre los usuarios potenciales de la tecnología y los ingenieros y desarrolladores de estos proyectos tecnológicos para asegurar que la tecnología se implementa de forma adecuado para su uso en el mundo en desarrollo.
Rhizomatica comenzó para reunir recursos y promover la aplicación de nuevas tecnologías de telecomunicaciones a problemas reales del mundo. Nuestro primer proyecto fue el primer despliegue en un contexto “vivo” del software Serval de redes móviles ad-hoc para facilitar la comunicación entre defensores de los derechos humanos en la zona del delta del Níger de Nigeria (véase: http://mediaforjusticenigeria.org).
Resumen y Antecedentes
Según la UIT, 2 a 3 mil millones de personas en todo el mundo carecen de servicios asequibles de telefonía móvil que facilitan las comunicaciones críticas y el acceso a la información. Debido a la saturación del mercado en los países desarrollados y desincentivos económicos en el mundo en desarrollo y especialmente las zonas rurales, la proliferación de cobertura móvil se está desacelerando drásticamente en todo el mundo.
Y sin embargo, la mayoría de las regulaciones de telecomunicaciones prohíbe la prestación del servicio estrictamente rural, efectivamente imposibilitando el crecimiento de un sector nuevo de micro operadores.
Actualmente, sólo empresas muy grandes y poderosas tienen acceso al espectro móvil y las concesiones para prestar servicios de telefonía móvil. Sin embargo, su modelo de negocio y la tecnología que utilizan estos proveedores tradicionales han demostrado ser incapaces de resolve el problema de conectar gran parte del mundo. Queremos romper este oligopolio y permitir que las comunidades se convierten en proveedores de servicios de telefonía también.

Este proyecto tiene un componente paralelo que se está tratando de desarrollar un espacio legal / regulatorio y garantizar el acceso a las frecuencias necesarias para fomentar el crecimiento de un nuevo sector rural y comunitario.
Lo que necesitamos
Estamos tratando de construir la primera red GSM (teléfono móvil) independiente en México, en el estado de Oaxaca. La parte inicial del proyecto, se ha demostrado con el uso del software OpenBTS y una radio de prueba de baja potencia (USRP), y se ha presentado en asambleas comunitarias y con grupos a lo largo del estado, especialmente en comunidades rurales e indígenas.

En caso de no llegar a la cantidad necesaria para comprar todo el equipo, vamos a intentarlo de todos modos como sea posible y cubrir los gastos restantes de otras maneras.
El Impacto
Estamos tratando de crear la primera red GSM en el mundo (hasta donde sabemos). Si el proyecto tiene éxito, tenemos varias comunidades y municipios interesados en invertir, crear redes y en lograr redes fiables de bajo costo y en cualquier lugar. También podría significar un realidad totalmente diferente y revolucionaria en las redes móviles en un futuro próximo - uno que garantiza la libertad de comunicación y utiliza la tecnología de las telecomunicaciones como una manera de ayudar a la gente hablar entre ellos.
Otras formas de apoyar
Si no nos puede apoyar directamente con dinero, todavía hay muchas maneras de ayudar:

Corre la voz! Cuanto más se sabe acerca de lo que estamos haciendo, mejor.


Piense acerca de los posibles usos de una red comunitaria, y nos dicenal respecto.


Si tiene conocimiento de proyectos similares, basados en la tecnología GSM, por favor díganos dónde están. Si usted es parte de él, compartir su experiencia con nosotros.

<li>
<p><span><strong>Cynaps</strong> (derived from 'synapse') is the world's first Bluetooth enabled, bone conduction headset, discreetly installed into an easy to wear hat. No earphones are required.  Just wear your hat, and the sound from your phone or PC is conducted directly into your inner ear through vibration.  You can listen to music or have a phone or Skype (for PC &amp; Mac) conversation, even while doing an activity that requires your ears, eyes and hands to be available.</span></p>
<p><span><img alt=""Cynaps: Ears-Free"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1340.photobucket.com/albums/o737/MaxVirtual/earsfree_zps83a7c5ee.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 582.693px; height: 328px;"" title=""Cynaps: Ears-Free""/></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Running and biking are perfect examples.</strong>  Normal bluetooth earpieces cover your ear, and you lose your ability to hear exactly where other cars may be around you.  Cynaps lets you keep this crucial ability, while enabling you to discreetly take a call, anytime, anywhere, keeping you safe and giving you back all of your senses!  Also, it's not putting pressure on your eardrums like conventional headsets or handsets do, so you won't get the headaches, earaches and arm-aches you normally get after a few hours of holding and talking on a handheld phone.  You can talk for much longer with Cynaps without getting tired.  And you can freely do whatever you want, at the same time.<br/>
</span><span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1267362/files/20150304055647-new1.jpg?1425477407"" src="""" style=""width: 578.003px; height: 299px;""/></span></p>
<p><span>The<strong> battery life</strong> of Cynaps is amazing.  Standby time is around <strong>30 days</strong>, and the average talk time is between<strong> 6 and 10 hours</strong>.  This wide range depends mostly on the volume setting and how frequently the audio part is used.  The microphone uses up almost none of the battery life, while the audio (vibration) accounts for almost all of it, so listening to very loud music on full volume can use up the battery in just a couple of hours.  Most people will be able to talk comfortably on medium volume for about 7-8 hours between recharges.  Most people can charge it once a day, but if you practically live on the phone or want to turn the volume up extra loud, it's worthwhile to have an extra Cynaps and battery backup on hand, just in case.</span></p>
<p><span>The controls are super easy. Just press the bill to take a call or play the current song on your phone or PC.  Also control the volume level and navigate your playlist, all from the simple control buttons under the bill.<br/>
</span><span><img alt=""Cynaps Control Panel"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1340.photobucket.com/albums/o737/MaxVirtual/control_zps99304bee.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 586.246px; height: 330px;"" title=""Cynaps Control Panel""/></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Cynaps can connect to any bluetooth enabled phone, PC or audio player.</strong>  Pairing is as easy as pressing a button to make Cynaps discoverable, then selecting Cynaps on your phone or PC.<br/>
</span><span><img alt=""Cynaps: Easy Bluetooth Pairing"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1340.photobucket.com/albums/o737/MaxVirtual/bluetooth_zps2c072951.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 575.46px; height: 323px;"" title=""Cynaps: Easy Bluetooth Pairing""/></span></p>
<p><span><br/>
</span>Working in a loud environment that requires earplugs?  Want some tunes but can't hear them?  Now you can!  Even with protective earplugs in, <strong>Cynaps is crystal clear. </strong> In fact, the sound is even better, richer and more pure with earplugs in!  Never miss a call, and always have some good tunes on hand to get you through the day.  Now if it could only make you coffee too :).  Perfect for any place you'd normally use earplugs: traveling, resting, etc.<br/>

No earphones are required.  Just wear your hat, and the sound from your phone or PC is conducted directly into your inner ear through vibration.  You can listen to music or have a phone or Skype (for PC & Mac) conversation, even while doing an activity that requires your ears, eyes and hands to be available.

Running and biking are perfect examples.  Normal bluetooth earpieces cover your ear, and you lose your ability to hear exactly where other cars may be around you.  Cynaps lets you keep this crucial ability, while enabling you to discreetly take a call, anytime, anywhere, keeping you safe and giving you back all of your senses!  Also, it's not putting pressure on your eardrums like conventional headsets or handsets do, so you won't get the headaches, earaches and arm-aches you normally get after a few hours of holding and talking on a handheld phone.  You can talk for much longer with Cynaps without getting tired.  And you can freely do whatever you want, at the same time.

The battery life of Cynaps is amazing.  Standby time is around 30 days, and the average talk time is between 6 and 10 hours.  This wide range depends mostly on the volume setting and how frequently the audio part is used.  The microphone uses up almost none of the battery life, while the audio (vibration) accounts for almost all of it, so listening to very loud music on full volume can use up the battery in just a couple of hours.  Most people will be able to talk comfortably on medium volume for about 7-8 hours between recharges.  Most people can charge it once a day, but if you practically live on the phone or want to turn the volume up extra loud, it's worthwhile to have an extra Cynaps and battery backup on hand, just in case.
The controls are super easy. Just press the bill to take a call or play the current song on your phone or PC.  Also control the volume level and navigate your playlist, all from the simple control buttons under the bill.

Cynaps can connect to any bluetooth enabled phone, PC or audio player.  Pairing is as easy as pressing a button to make Cynaps discoverable, then selecting Cynaps on your phone or PC.


Working in a loud environment that requires earplugs?  Want some tunes but can't hear them?  Now you can!  Even with protective earplugs in, Cynaps is crystal clear.  In fact, the sound is even better, richer and more pure with earplugs in!  Never miss a call, and always have some good tunes on hand to get you through the day.  Now if it could only make you coffee too :).  Perfect for any place you'd normally use earplugs: traveling, resting, etc.

<p>Ich möchte hiermit den MachineCoin bekannter machen. Beim MachineCoin handelt es sich um eine Art ""Tauschwährung"" die selbst wiederum in einem vollständig dezentralen Banken- und Finanzsystem eingebettet ist. </p>
<p><b>Vorgeschichte:</b></p>
<p>Als ausgelöst durch eine Immobilienpreis-Blase im Jahr 2007 die auch bis heute noch andauernde Weltwirtschaftskrise einsetzte wurde mir ziemlich schnell bewusst, welche spürbaren Nachteile ein zentrales Finanzsystem doch mit sich bringt. Ein zentrales Finanzsystem bei dem Geld im Prinzip nur allein durch einen Knopfdruck und dabei ohne eine real existierende Entsprechung in Form von Produkten und/oder Dienstleistungen erzeugt werden kann. Der Wunsch nach einer Alternative verfestigte sich schon damals in mir.</p>
<p><b>Gegenwart:</b></p>
<p>Ich, das ist der Jürgen, 31 Jahre alt, geboren in Quedlinburg, wohnhaft in Hofheim, Experte auf dem Gebiet der Theoretischen Informatik, Datenbanken, Computergrafik und des WWW, habe mir Anfang 2014 meinen lang ersehnten Traum erfüllt und ein vollständig dezentrales Banken- und Finanzsystem erstellt, welches nicht über die eingangs erwähnten Nachteile verfügt. Sein Name: MachineCoin. Seit nunmehr 8 Monaten ist das System mittlerweile nun schon erfolgreich im Einsatz und ich hoffe hiermit auch den einen oder anderen von euch dafür begeistern zu können.</p>

<p><i>An den MachineCoin kann jede Privatperson oder jedes Unternehmen vollkommen selbständig ""andocken"" und zwar ganz ohne dabei sich auch nur im geringsten mit irgendjemanden in irgendeiner Form absprechen zu müssen.

<p><i>Eine MachineCoin-Adresse ist vergleichbar mit der Kontonummer die man auch bei einer herkömmlichen Bank bekommt. Eine eigene ganz persönliche MachineCoin-Adresse kann man sich unter anderem mit der MachineCoin Online-Banking-App oder auch mit dem MachineCoin-Paper-Wallet-Generator erstellen und dann ausdrucken und abheften.

<p><b>Warum ""5+15 MachineCoin"" statt gleich 20 wie bei dem Perk für 5 Euro?</b></p>
<p>Es sind insgesamt 4 Funding-Runden geplant. Mit jeder weiteren Funding-Runde steigt der Preis dann in Richtung Ziel von 1 MachineCoin = 1 Euro. Die erste Runde startet bei einem Kurs von 4/1.

<p><b>Kann ich mir etwas für meine MachineCoin kaufen?</b></p>
<p><i>Ja, denn: treffen Käufer und Verkäufer für Produkte und/oder Dienstleistungen von MachineCoin aufeinander und darüber hinaus auch eine beiderseitige Vereinbarung über die Ausgestaltung eines Tauschs dann entsteht dabei automatisch auch ein Kauf.

<p><b>Wie kommt es eigentlich, dass der MachineCoin wie ""Geld"" ist? ""Geld"", was ist das eigentlich?</b><br/></p>
<p><i>""Geld"" stellt im Wesentlichen doch nur eins dar: eine Art Austauschmedium mit dem sich Produkte und/oder Dienstleistungen zwischen zwei ""Parteien"" austauschen lassen und zwar auch dann wenn der jeweilige Käufer eines Produktes und/oder einer Dienstleistung dem jeweiligen Verkäufer des Produktes und/oder der Dienstleistung keine eigenen Produkte und/oder Dienstleistungen im Gegenzug anbieten kann und zwar solche die der Verkäufer in Bezug auf ihre Menge und ihre erachtete Wertigkeit als etwa gleich wertvoll ansieht. In solchen Fällen vereinbaren beide ""Parteien"" dann in der Regel einfach ein ""Geld"" wie zum Beispiel den Euro oder den US-Dollar. Auch der Euro oder der US-Dollar ist damit eine Art Austauschmedium von dem der Verkäufer exakt im Moment der Annahme glaubt dieses dann wiederum zu einer gegebenen Zeit und an einem gewissen Ort gegen ein Produkt und/oder Dienstleistung seiner Wahl eintauschen zu können.</i></p>

<p>We're tinkerers at heart and our days are a stream of ideas we can't shake. We see the world as an endless opportunity to make things a little better. We believe that a simple idea from a tiny group of people can have an impact. And if you're lucky, a big impact.</p>
<p>A new phone case won't change the world, but the belief that no matter how small you are, you can take something people use every day and make it just a little bit better will.</p>
<p>The MEGAVERSE Anti-Gravity Case is a proof of concept for all of us that small is the new big and that's why we launch our products through crowdfunding. This is the place where the tiny come together to make big things happen. This is the place where everyday things are made better by everyday people and that's why we're here.</p>
<p>So our ask today is simple: Take a moment right now and share this project with your friends using the share tools at the top of this page. Let them know there's a simple idea here that you think they'll love. And then after that, make sure to explore IndieGoGo and look for the passionate people and projects that need your support to become a reality.</p>
<p>We'll continue working hard to make things better ... and together with you, we'll make them happen.</p>

He wanted to add lenses and other accessories to improve the iPhone’s capabilities as a camera. He also wanted a solution that maintained a compact form factor, provided mechanical strength and reliability, and allowed him to continue using the iPhone as a smartphone.He didn't find anything that fit his needs, so he leveraged his engineering background and product development experience to produce the product that he believed would best fit the needs of demanding creatives. The Helium Core is the result of that effort.  The Helium Core team is made up of two people, Brandon and Walt.  Brandon (l) and Walt (r)Brandon has been a full-time professional photographer and filmmaker for 5 years. Prior to his pursuit of a creative career, he worked in engineering and product development. At his last corporate gig, he was a product manager at Lenovo, where he successfully brought 6 notebook products with combined sales of over USD4 billion to market.Walt has been designing and manufacturing products successfully for over 30 years, and has designed rocket engines, jet engine components, and turbochargers, for companies such as Boeing, Pratt & Whitney and Borg Warner.Between them, they have a wealth of experience in the design, development, manufacture and go-to market launch of products. This experience enables them to understand and plan for the challenges typically associated with projects such as this one.",22.0,5,"1 Campaign

Welcome to Tennis Central
There are 65 million tennis fans in the US alone but only 5
million are frequent players.  This
staggering fact means that the tennis industry has not yet found a way to
simplify access to the game, which keeps more than 90% of our fan base from
playing. Tennis Central directly addresses this challenge, and provides
carefully crafted features and experiences designed to make playing tennis more
accessible, easy, and fun.  The Tennis
Central Mobile App was designed to connect tennis fans and give them all an
experience like no other.

ITunes Style Instruction  
Tennis Central has pre-loaded thousands of dollars of tennis courses and lessons that you can access for free or at a ridiculously
low price.  Because we use an Itunes style delivery, you can access the lessons you need and leave the rest for later.  We made your tennis

weapons. Care to watch a video during the change over to change the course of your match?   There is an app for that!  Moreover, we regularly add new
courses from some of the most reputable sources so you will never run out of

Let the Tennis Central App turn your serve into the highlight of the day!

wallet for Android smartphones</span></b></p>
<p><b>Introduction of ourselves</b></p>
<p>First of all we are obviously very strong believers and real enthusiasts of
the Bitcoin. Due to the global crisis and a decreasing trust in the monetary financial
systems we believe that the world is in urge of a new and transparent currency
which cannot be interfered and/or be influenced by humans or central banks.</p>
<p>Our team has two Dutch co-founders. Our backgrounds lays in banking, IT and
marketing. Because of our backgrounds we became truly passionate about
Bitcoins. We have heard from the phenomenon Bitcoin since early 2010. We have
seen close by how the financial crises emerged. In the news you still hear on a
daily base that CEO’s get well overpaid and banks go bankrupt. That is exactly
what we see as very unfair since the normal hard working tax payer has to work
around the clock and pay eventually for the caused damage.</p>
<p>We have a clear vision about what we would like to achieve.</p>
<p><b>Our vision is:</b> Make
cryptocurrency accessible and easy for everybody by developing granny proof
solutions.</p>
<p><b>Our mission is:</b> Proof
that we are the best not by saying we are the best, but by reaching top 5 for
wallet providers in the world. We are ambitious.</p>
<p>Because of our individual skills we are an all-round team which is able to
cover the fields from marketing to actual developing. All the required skills
are in-house, together with our IT partner in India.</p>
<p><b>Who are the team members?</b></p><p><b></b></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1039705/files/20141123052032-junanto_and_patrick_easbit.jpg?1416748832"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

<p><b>What is this about?</b></p>
<p>We are a startup in software development for cryptocurrency. A granny proof
and high level security Bitcoin wallet for Android smartphones is the product.
It is an Android application for smartphones which enables users to send and
receive secured transactions in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. We always keep in
mind that the usability <u>MUST</u> be as easy as using cash. From
our perspective this is the only way to get Bitcoin “mainstream”. It is
nonsense to say that solely this app would achieve this. But we definitely try
to contribute to this process. Summarizing, the usage of cryptocurrency needs
to be granny proof and safe in order to go global it is as simple as that!</p>
<p><b>Why the Easbit App?</b></p>
<p><b>Granny proof:</b></p>
<p>Bitcoin nowadays still has the image of being not user friendly and that
usage is only meant for IT people. We want to accomplish to get rid of this
image for Bitcoin. Bitcoin is meant for everybody around the globe! One thing
which really distinguished ourselves from the competition is that we found a
very user friendly way to handle the user unfriendly long Bitcoin addresses.
Therefore all that counts for us is developing a wallet which meets 100% the
needs for all kind of users. Which means: keep it stupid simple! Our goal is
everybody should be able to use our app. And by everybody we mean everybody who
uses cash today. Granny proof so to speak.</p>
<p><b>Android smartphones</b></p>
<p>We have consciously decided to develop a wallet for Android based
smartphones. We did this for a reason.  </p>
<p>First of all according to EMarketer.com a smartphone will become more and
more globally an essential part of our daily lives, if it isn’t already. So for
Bitcoin it will be extremely important to be easily spendable by a smartphone.
Security again plays here also a major role. A penetration of more than 33% of
the global population is estimated to have a smartphone by 2017.</p><p></p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1039709/files/20141123052137-smartphone_users_and_penetration_worldwide_2012-2017.gif?1416748897"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand we have the operating systems (OS). Our aim is that we
would like to make our app available for as much people as possible. But we
always keep in mind that what we do execute as perfect as possible. We are
taking it step by step. So we have chosen to start off with the OS Android.
Simply because it has the largest market share, it is most widely used and its
open source character. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1039710/files/20141123052224-global_smartphone.jpg?1416748944"" src="""" style=""width: 620px; height: 349px;""/></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Mobile payments</b></p>
<p>Our choice is also based on the future of mobile payments.</p>
<p>Technology researcher Gartner forecasts that the worldwide mobile payment
market will have over 450 million users and a transaction value of more than
$721 billion in 2017. This represents compound annual growth rates of 18% and
35% respectively for the period 2012 to 2017.</p>
<p><b>Non-US based:</b></p>
<p>Privacy is a big issue. Terms like NSA, spying, malware are common
headlines these days. Of course it is not a guarantee, but the majority of the
Bitcoin firms are US-based and we are not. Only 10% is European based and 61%
US based (source: Coindesk). It brings in some balance.</p>
<p><b>Security &amp; privacy</b></p>
<p>We are on top of our game when it comes to security. All critical data such
as keys and exchanged data is encrypted. We will provide easy use for
(automatic) backup facilities. The safety of your Bitcoins is our highest
priority.</p>
<p>Accenture did a study on mobile payments. When it comes to mobile payments
there are 3 things which are important:</p>
<p>1. Security</p>
<p>2. Privacy</p>
<p>3. Convenience</p>
<p>(source: <a href=""http://www.accenture.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/PDF/FinancialServices/Accenture-Consumer-Mobile-Payments-Survey.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Accenture</span></a>)</p>
<p>We have developed our Android mobile application based on these
fundamentals.</p>
<p><b>Storage</b></p>
<p>We do not store your Bitcoins (in other words the keys) on a central
location. The main principal of Bitcoin is decentralization. This is a matter
we do not like to interfere in. So we do not store any Bitcoin related data on
our servers. The Bitcoins are stored locally on your own smartphone, just like
you carry your own cash in your own wallet. Which means you are ALWAYS really
in charge of your Bitcoins. Such thing which happened at Mt Gox is simply not
possible, because we do not store your Bitcoins, private keys, public keys,
personal information or any kind of crucial data. We only provide secured
transactions and we will be hosting user friendly services to make the usage of
your wallet as easy and secure as possible.</p>
<p><b>Backup</b></p>
<p>Of course we have added reliable and secured backup features. As well as
cold storage and easy restoring in case of losing you smartphone.</p>
<p><b>Developing</b></p>
<p>We develop our software according level 5 CMMI (Capability Maturity Model
Integration) standards. We outsource the actual coding in India. The Indian
company is a level 5 organization. Also many other Dutch leading companies are
engaged with the same company. The company usually engages with larger
companies/customers, but they were also impressed by our ideas for
cryptocurrency and found it an interesting topic, that is the reason they have
committed themselves to our startup.</p>
<p>Level 5 means: It is a characteristic of processes at this level that the
focus is on continually improving process performance through both incremental
and innovative technological changes/improvements. (source: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Maturity_Model"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Wikipedia</span></a>)  </p>
<p>Working according the system does not guarantees anything of course. But it
says something about the maturity level we develop.</p>
<p>It is also important to know is that we code native. The reason we do this
is that people spend more and more time on their smartphones. Daily activities
contain surfing the web, downloading apps, playing games and streaming videos.
Simply said it is not possible to create the same rich and functional
experiences as you would achieve with for e.g. HTML5.</p>
<p><b>What we need &amp; what you get</b></p>
<p>We are currently already developing the application, and approaching final
stage of development. We have funded the development in the initial phase
so far by ourselves. In order to finish the application and fully test it we
need an additional $25k.</p>
<p>We truly hope that you will be our supporter and contribute to our project.
We genuinely think that we can contribute to the mainstream process of Bitcoin
with our application. Of course we do not stop developing after the first
release. In case of overfunding we will spend it on additional features. We
have lots in mind as additional features!</p>
<p>Project accounting will be shown at our website: <a href=""http://www.easbit.com/project-development."" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://www.easbit.com/project-development.</span></a></p>
<p>The application will be released January.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1039712/files/20141123052318-allocation_of_the_funds_easbit.jpg?1416748998"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>At a current status only 14% (source: Coindesk) of the companies involved
in the Bitcoin ecosystem are wallet providers. We think there is still a lot to
do to get Bitcoin mainstream. Especially when you think that a wallet is
basically an essential need in order to spend your Bitcoins. So it is crucial
part of the Bitcoin ecosystem. And especially this part of the ecosystem
requires granny proof software.</p>
<p>A lot is said about Bitcoin. But there is one thing the majority agrees on
there is a need for a “Killer-App”. We are convinced that our app can
contribute to the mainstream process significantly. It is up to the crowd to
decide whether it is a killer app or not. A granny proof and safe app is all

wallet for Android smartphones
Introduction of ourselves
First of all we are obviously very strong believers and real enthusiasts of
the Bitcoin. Due to the global crisis and a decreasing trust in the monetary financial
systems we believe that the world is in urge of a new and transparent currency
which cannot be interfered and/or be influenced by humans or central banks.
Our team has two Dutch co-founders. Our backgrounds lays in banking, IT and
marketing. Because of our backgrounds we became truly passionate about
Bitcoins. We have heard from the phenomenon Bitcoin since early 2010. We have
seen close by how the financial crises emerged. In the news you still hear on a
daily base that CEO’s get well overpaid and banks go bankrupt. That is exactly
what we see as very unfair since the normal hard working tax payer has to work
around the clock and pay eventually for the caused damage.
We have a clear vision about what we would like to achieve.
Our vision is: Make
cryptocurrency accessible and easy for everybody by developing granny proof
solutions.
Our mission is: Proof
that we are the best not by saying we are the best, but by reaching top 5 for
wallet providers in the world. We are ambitious.
Because of our individual skills we are an all-round team which is able to
cover the fields from marketing to actual developing. All the required skills
are in-house, together with our IT partner in India.
Who are the team members?

Linkedin: Junanto van der Veen: Core Skills: Project management, IT-developing, Networking, Banking
and Philosopher
Linkedin: Patrick van Ek: Core Skills: Marketing, SEO, Networking, Designing and Philosopher
What is this about?
We are a startup in software development for cryptocurrency. A granny proof
and high level security Bitcoin wallet for Android smartphones is the product.
It is an Android application for smartphones which enables users to send and
receive secured transactions in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. We always keep in
mind that the usability MUST be as easy as using cash. From
our perspective this is the only way to get Bitcoin “mainstream”. It is
nonsense to say that solely this app would achieve this. But we definitely try
to contribute to this process. Summarizing, the usage of cryptocurrency needs
to be granny proof and safe in order to go global it is as simple as that!
Why the Easbit App?
Granny proof:
Bitcoin nowadays still has the image of being not user friendly and that
usage is only meant for IT people. We want to accomplish to get rid of this
image for Bitcoin. Bitcoin is meant for everybody around the globe! One thing
which really distinguished ourselves from the competition is that we found a
very user friendly way to handle the user unfriendly long Bitcoin addresses.
Therefore all that counts for us is developing a wallet which meets 100% the
needs for all kind of users. Which means: keep it stupid simple! Our goal is
everybody should be able to use our app. And by everybody we mean everybody who
uses cash today. Granny proof so to speak.
Android smartphones
We have consciously decided to develop a wallet for Android based
smartphones. We did this for a reason.  
First of all according to EMarketer.com a smartphone will become more and
more globally an essential part of our daily lives, if it isn’t already. So for
Bitcoin it will be extremely important to be easily spendable by a smartphone.
Security again plays here also a major role. A penetration of more than 33% of
the global population is estimated to have a smartphone by 2017.

On the other hand we have the operating systems (OS). Our aim is that we
would like to make our app available for as much people as possible. But we
always keep in mind that what we do execute as perfect as possible. We are
taking it step by step. So we have chosen to start off with the OS Android.
Simply because it has the largest market share, it is most widely used and its
open source character. 

Mobile payments
Our choice is also based on the future of mobile payments.
Technology researcher Gartner forecasts that the worldwide mobile payment
market will have over 450 million users and a transaction value of more than
$721 billion in 2017. This represents compound annual growth rates of 18% and
35% respectively for the period 2012 to 2017.
Non-US based:
Privacy is a big issue. Terms like NSA, spying, malware are common
headlines these days. Of course it is not a guarantee, but the majority of the
Bitcoin firms are US-based and we are not. Only 10% is European based and 61%
US based (source: Coindesk). It brings in some balance.
Security & privacy
We are on top of our game when it comes to security. All critical data such
as keys and exchanged data is encrypted. We will provide easy use for
(automatic) backup facilities. The safety of your Bitcoins is our highest
priority.
Accenture did a study on mobile payments. When it comes to mobile payments
there are 3 things which are important:
1. Security
2. Privacy
3. Convenience
(source: Accenture)
We have developed our Android mobile application based on these
fundamentals.
Storage
We do not store your Bitcoins (in other words the keys) on a central
location. The main principal of Bitcoin is decentralization. This is a matter
we do not like to interfere in. So we do not store any Bitcoin related data on
our servers. The Bitcoins are stored locally on your own smartphone, just like
you carry your own cash in your own wallet. Which means you are ALWAYS really
in charge of your Bitcoins. Such thing which happened at Mt Gox is simply not
possible, because we do not store your Bitcoins, private keys, public keys,
personal information or any kind of crucial data. We only provide secured
transactions and we will be hosting user friendly services to make the usage of
your wallet as easy and secure as possible.
Backup
Of course we have added reliable and secured backup features. As well as
cold storage and easy restoring in case of losing you smartphone.
Developing
We develop our software according level 5 CMMI (Capability Maturity Model
Integration) standards. We outsource the actual coding in India. The Indian
company is a level 5 organization. Also many other Dutch leading companies are
engaged with the same company. The company usually engages with larger
companies/customers, but they were also impressed by our ideas for
cryptocurrency and found it an interesting topic, that is the reason they have
committed themselves to our startup.
Level 5 means: It is a characteristic of processes at this level that the
focus is on continually improving process performance through both incremental
and innovative technological changes/improvements. (source: Wikipedia)  
Working according the system does not guarantees anything of course. But it
says something about the maturity level we develop.
It is also important to know is that we code native. The reason we do this
is that people spend more and more time on their smartphones. Daily activities
contain surfing the web, downloading apps, playing games and streaming videos.
Simply said it is not possible to create the same rich and functional
experiences as you would achieve with for e.g. HTML5.
What we need & what you get
We are currently already developing the application, and approaching final
stage of development. We have funded the development in the initial phase
so far by ourselves. In order to finish the application and fully test it we
need an additional $25k.
We truly hope that you will be our supporter and contribute to our project.
We genuinely think that we can contribute to the mainstream process of Bitcoin
with our application. Of course we do not stop developing after the first
release. In case of overfunding we will spend it on additional features. We
have lots in mind as additional features!
Project accounting will be shown at our website: http://www.easbit.com/project-development.
The application will be released January.The Impact
At a current status only 14% (source: Coindesk) of the companies involved
in the Bitcoin ecosystem are wallet providers. We think there is still a lot to
do to get Bitcoin mainstream. Especially when you think that a wallet is
basically an essential need in order to spend your Bitcoins. So it is crucial
part of the Bitcoin ecosystem. And especially this part of the ecosystem
requires granny proof software.
A lot is said about Bitcoin. But there is one thing the majority agrees on
there is a need for a “Killer-App”. We are convinced that our app can
contribute to the mainstream process significantly. It is up to the crowd to
decide whether it is a killer app or not. A granny proof and safe app is all
that counts for us. Bitcoin is also described as money for nerds. Because of
its open and transparent character it should be available for everybody with a
smartphone. Processing a payment should be easier as swiping your card. That is
what we try to accomplish. 
Technology is for everybody. Bitcoin may leapfrog credit cards. Due to lack
of credit cards, approximately 65% and 35% (source: Coindesk) of all e-commerce
in China and India respectively conducted with cash.
Another important feature of the Bitcoin is relatively cheap remittance
transactions.
Remittance: Average global remittance fee of 8.14% per $200 ($16.28)
Bitcoin average transaction fee is $0.004
Remittance vs Bitcoin: Bitcoin is 4,070 times cheaper on a $200
transaction.
(Source: Coindesk)
By using the Easbit app people can send money globally almost instantly
against very low fees comparing to traditional ways.
According to Wedbush Securities can (an award-winning research
platform) Bitcoin become huge.

This is Surgery Academy.Twitter: @Armando_IandoloBlog: http://armandoiandolo.comWhat is Surgery AcademySurgery Academy is the tool for learning surgery anywhere you are, through a smartphone, tablet or pc.We are creating a MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) for students of medicine and surgery and for health professionals.Students, surgeons, interns and healthcare professionals will finally be able to enter into a real operating room. They will be able to consult the anonymised medical records of patients under surgery, ask and reply to questions.How does It workA student or a health professional can join into a random operating room or choose the surgical intervention by his favourite discipline. Joined in the remote operating room, the student will see the three most important things: patient records, the surgical intervention in streaming in 1080p (with the patient's vital signs) and a notetaking platform that can works like a service of microblogging.It allows to share surgical procedures, annotations and intervention's screenshot with other students.As seen on

What?

Every day, all over the world, surgeons perform millions of surgeries, from appendectomies to heart transplants. 

However, students of Medicine and Surgery do not have a practical approach until the 5th year of study. On the other hand, a surgeon in a difficult phase can not receive some sort of suggestion by a third party. The operating room is like a secret society.


What students should see


The surgical operations in real time and in augmented reality
Blood pressure 
Heart rate
Respiratory rate
Body temperature
O2 saturation

Patients medical records, anonymised.







What students could do



Watching preferred surgical operations and save them on the cloud
Entering in the operating room of an hospital of Timbuktu 
Social Networking
Gamifying their studying
And many more features to come





For students


               


We know that until the 5th year of study, students of medicine and surgery can't have a practical approach with the scalpel. When they are interns, they only have little practical knowledge. 
The most important benefits are:


Appropriate for any setting that has connectivity (Web or Wi-Fi)
Any language or multiple languages
Any online tools
Escape time zones and physical boundaries
Produce and deliver in short timeframe (e.g. for relief aid)
Contextualized content can be shared by all
Informal setting
Peer-to-peer contact can trigger serendipitous learning
Easier to cross disciplines and institutional barriers
Lower barriers to student entry
Enhance personal learning environment and/or network by participating
Improve lifelong learning skills



For surgeons 



                     

Surgeons, universities, hospitals they can introduce Surgery Academy as program of study.
Surgery Academy can enter into the medical and educational establishment, and can be used as method of study and teaching from all the university of the world.


Yeah Science!


 




Beginning to share medical knowledge to who can't to access to surgical documentations, medical notions and surgical procedures, is a great and powerful thing.
For example, a surgeon of the John Hopkins Hospital can teach to a surgeon in Nigeria, in real time, how to do a reconstructive surgery or an organ transplantation.
The progress of science is to share with other minds all that you know.


Why we need You

As some of you may know, we already have some funding (meaning our project does what it says it does) and with our own savings we have managed to create working prototypes.
However, the magnitude of our dream is too large for just us, and we need you (and your funds), to accelerate development and to help us bring our machines into manufacture and into your homes.



Comparisons with other MOOCs




                                                       And it doesn't end here.






Why Massive Open Online Course


We know that many hospitals have surgery theaters, but these allow only a bunch of students to see a surgical intervention. Nevertheless, hospitals always need visibility to attract new customers. Hospitals will be eager to join our social health network as we increase our community of students and surgeons from all over the world.



Our current pipeline, more to come!









Where Surgery Academy works






Then, why Indiegogo?

1. Core development: the majority of the core is complete. We need to fine tune a couple of features and take the proper time to thoroughly test everything.

2. Native OS X: We need to round out some application support mechanisms such as updates and feedback.
3. Desktop version: We have been focused primarily on the OS X version, but we can easily port Surgery Academy over a desktop PC or Mac.
4. User support mechanisms: We will be deploying forums and developing a comprehensive help section.
5. Special features: We have a few unmentioned – and pretty awesome – features that we'd love to give you in version 1, which we'll be able to do it if we raise enough funding.


Why 6,000 $?
For a project like this $ 6,000 are essential to operate as a sparkle in engines.

<p><span> </span></p>
<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>What is CamBuff?</span></h2>
<p>CamBuff is a tiny gadget that lets you use an iPhone/iPad/iPod touch as a remote for your DSLR. CamBuff is not just another remote trigger for your DSLR, we've added some features that we love as photographers. CamBuff uses the latest Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to enable your iPhone to talk to the camera and consumes very little battery in doing so.</p>
<p>CamBuff is an easy to use accessory. Just plug the device into your DSLR, run our app and you are good to go. No additional configuration is required. CamBuff's companion iPhone/iPad app will be available free of cost from the iTunes store.</p>
<h2>In short, why should I support CamBuff?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Upto 16 Hours of battery backup.</li>
<li>30m-50m wireless range from your iOS device.</li>
<li>Slick - Snappy UI.</li>
<li>Standalone Intervalometer/Timelapse photography.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><img alt=""DSLR plugin"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://googledrive.com/host/0B-JKiUqveHCNVDNldGxXRHFKWDg/plugin.gif"" src="""" style="""" title=""DSLR Plugin""/></span></p>
<h2 dir=""ltr""><span> </span></h2>
<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>What can it do?</span></h2>
<p dir=""ltr"">With CamBuff iOS app, you can control settings like Shutter Speed, Aperture, ISO, White Balance, Auto focus mode, Preview mode, etc. You can also view the disk space, picture quality and battery level of your camera. While designing the UI, we gave a careful thought to make the controls real slick, so that you never miss a shot while changing the settings of your camera. After multiple UI iterations (and partial bias to video game controllers <img alt="":D"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://bufferlabs.in/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif"" src="""" style="""" title="":D""/> ), we arrived at a rather snappy UI for the iPhone companion app.</p>
<p><span> <img alt=""Various controls"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://googledrive.com/host/0B-JKiUqveHCNVDNldGxXRHFKWDg/various_controls.gif"" src="""" style="""" title=""Various controls""/></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""> </p>
<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>Ok! You can change the settings, what else?</span></h2>
<p>CamBuff doesn’t stop at changing the settings and capturing a single picture, we've made it super easy to perform programmed tasks. You can run a Timed bulb shot, take Time Lapse images and Exposure Bracketing. The device is standalone, this means once you set up the time lapse, you don’t need to stick around while the device captures shots from your DSLR. </p>

What is CamBuff?
CamBuff is a tiny gadget that lets you use an iPhone/iPad/iPod touch as a remote for your DSLR. CamBuff is not just another remote trigger for your DSLR, we've added some features that we love as photographers. CamBuff uses the latest Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to enable your iPhone to talk to the camera and consumes very little battery in doing so.
CamBuff is an easy to use accessory. Just plug the device into your DSLR, run our app and you are good to go. No additional configuration is required. CamBuff's companion iPhone/iPad app will be available free of cost from the iTunes store.
In short, why should I support CamBuff?

Upto 16 Hours of battery backup.
30m-50m wireless range from your iOS device.
Slick - Snappy UI.
Standalone Intervalometer/Timelapse photography.
 

 
What can it do?
With CamBuff iOS app, you can control settings like Shutter Speed, Aperture, ISO, White Balance, Auto focus mode, Preview mode, etc. You can also view the disk space, picture quality and battery level of your camera. While designing the UI, we gave a careful thought to make the controls real slick, so that you never miss a shot while changing the settings of your camera. After multiple UI iterations (and partial bias to video game controllers  ), we arrived at a rather snappy UI for the iPhone companion app.
 
 
Ok! You can change the settings, what else?
CamBuff doesn’t stop at changing the settings and capturing a single picture, we've made it super easy to perform programmed tasks. You can run a Timed bulb shot, take Time Lapse images and Exposure Bracketing. The device is standalone, this means once you set up the time lapse, you don’t need to stick around while the device captures shots from your DSLR. 
 
Time Lapse

 
Exposure Bracketing 

 
Bulb Shot

Summary







The SYLPHYO is a new wind musical instrument,
providing the feeling of an acoustic wind instrument, with
extra possibilities of electronic devices. 







						The
SYLPHYO is designed to provide easy access to the
expressive world of wind instrument to any musician. It can also be played silently for training, or used for writing scores.




As a standard MIDI controller, the SYLPHYO  naturally integrates in any electronic music setup, from vintage
analog synthesizers to virtual based instruments, running
on computers, tablets or smartphones. 






Our vision








AODYO creates innovative musical instruments, developed with musicians for musicians.
We are a team of passionate people, focusing on the use of new technology for musical
practice. 








We wish to provide instruments that are easy to use. For that reason,
anybody with a first level skill with flute recorder is able to quickly play the SYLPHYO.
Moreover, we include advanced control elements to allow musicians to go beyond and have
a full range of expression possibilities.














The Sylphyo : A new wind controller 






The SYLPHYO is a highly expressive
musical instrument thanks to its
patented advanced breath control
solution, giving space for your breath. It is designed to provide
similar blowing experience as acoustic
instruments.
	












 Inspired from proven acoustic
wind instrument, the SYLPHYO provides a way to
train your breath and fingering technics, with access to a large octave range.

					




With its easy to remove, clean or
replace mouthpiece, the SYLPHYO
allows you to share your
instrument.














The Sylphyo : A mobile instrument







The SYLPHYO is compact and lightweight,
making it easy to bring with you when
travelling. 

By integrating a built in Wireless MIDI
transmission solution, the SYLPHYO
provides you the freedom to move around
freely while playing and use the sound source
of your choice, including any virtual instrument
or any hardware MIDI synthesizer. You can also connect it to Smartphones and Tablets for
mobile use

					
				
With its additional internal sound engine
hardware expansion board, the SYLPHYO  also allows standalone training.


    








The Sylphyo : An electronic musical instrument





The SYLPHYO allows you to play in silence by using a headphone or
amplified for live performances.
The SYLPHYO also provides access to the infinite
sound palette available through standard MIDI
interface, from realistic acoustic wind instrument
emulation to unheard synthesized sounds. It also
allows new practice like VJing as it can interact with
lightning and video systems for realtime visual
performances.




The SYLPHYO is also an evolutionary instrument, with software and hardware upgrades.















Why Indiegogo ?






We are releasing our first product, the SYLPHYO.
Now we need your support to be
able to convert our prototypes to production-ready models, with final tooling and
manufacturing setup, to get all regulatory approvals and... launch the production!





This campaign will also help us to build an active user community around our
instrument and choose the nexte features of the SYLPHYO:
companion apps, sound engine expansion, alternative mouthpieces, Eurorack modular synth interface, etc.

For our backers







What we planned




We have been working on the SYLPHYO for 2 years now, and we have matured the SYLPHYO design, mastered its unique breath sensing technology, written code for the associated patent-pending technology, and built relationships with manufacturers. The SYLPHYO is now a prototype, but it's time for the next step: It's time for the SYLPHYO to be properly manufactured!

Background



I am a industrial designer and bag maker living in San Francisco. I have been working with leather and waxed canvas for about five years and started a bag company earlier this year called Pacificana. Pacificana is dedicated to designing quality bags and backpacks for everyday life that get better with time.

<h3><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Who We Are<br/></span></h3>
<p>We are the Free
 Network Foundation - builders and advocates of distributed and 
decentralized communication systems. We believe that the Internet should
 be used to connect people, not to spy on them, oppress them, or turn a 
profit. We envision technologies that will transform the network into 
something owned and operated by humanity itself, rather than by 
governments or profit-driven corporations.</p>
<h3>Our Struggle<br/>
</h3>It's hard to state the importance of this project accurately 
without sounding alarmist. Still, you deserve to know what's at stake. 
In the immediate sense, it's our ability to communicate with one another
 without being listened to by plutocrats. In the global sense, it's our 
essential freedom, and the future of our civilization. <br/><br/>
Make no mistake - our civil liberties, especially as they pertain to 
digital communications, are being quickly eroded. There are countless 
examples in recent days, of governments and corporations that have taken
 it upon themself to police and regulate the transmission of data on 
political grounds. From the Great Firewall of China, to the Egyptian 
blackout of the network, to Bay Area Rapid Tranit's cellular shutdown, 
to the silent and insidious use of Deep Packet Inspection that is 
practiced in secret by many of our Internet Service 
Providers - the signs of erosion are all around us. We have only to take
 heed.<br/><br/>
In response to these developments, we're building and deploying open 
source hardware and software solutions that allow people to 
cooperatively own and operate networks. These networks have the 
intelligence to route local traffic locally, without using the global 
internet - that way, there's never the opportunity for snooping.<br/><br/>We won't go into technical details here. The specifics of our architecture are available <a href=""http://www.freenetworkmovement.org/commons/index.php?title=Free_network_architecture"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""The Commons: Free Network Architecture"">here</a> if you would like to know more. In essence, though, we are developing three pieces of technology that will enable people to grow their own networks - connected to the Internet, but capable of operating autonomously. The first is FreedomNode, a small-form, low-power server that would enable a household to own their own data, and connect to the Free Network. The second is FreedomTower, which connects FreedomNodes together at a neighborhood level, allowing communities to form Internet co-ops. The third is FreedomLink, which connects FreedomTowers together so that the cooperative purchasing of bandwidth can grow.<br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/>Where We Come From<br/></span><div class="""" id=""magicdomid4"">

 can't speak for everyone, but I'll tell you my story. I'm Isaac - the  
co-founder and Executive Director of the Free Network Foundation. I've 
been a geek  all my life, but I realized that I wanted to dedicate my 
life to  building a better network when I travelled to Cuba in the 
summer of  2010. Faced with a nation with virtually no network access, I

 fall, I got together  with some colleagues and mentors to talk about 
network technologies.  What emerged was the Free Network Movement, and 
together we set out to  learn about how the Internet works, and envision

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>We are asking the world to fund us to the tune of $75,000. This amount will allow us to build the first three FreedomLinks, and operate them for a year. It will enable us to support the growing number of FreedomTower operators around the world. It will allow us to buy the hardware that we need in order to prototype the FreedomNode. $75,000 won't allow us to liberate the net completely, but it will give us a good start.<br/><br/>This is not a struggle that can be won overnight. It will take years, if not decades, to retrofit the internet with technologies that allow us to communicate directly with one another. Still, it is a struggle that must be begun.

</div></div>","Who We Are
We are the Free
 Network Foundation - builders and advocates of distributed and 
decentralized communication systems. We believe that the Internet should
 be used to connect people, not to spy on them, oppress them, or turn a 
profit. We envision technologies that will transform the network into 
something owned and operated by humanity itself, rather than by 
governments or profit-driven corporations.
Our Struggle
It's hard to state the importance of this project accurately 
without sounding alarmist. Still, you deserve to know what's at stake. 
In the immediate sense, it's our ability to communicate with one another
 without being listened to by plutocrats. In the global sense, it's our 
essential freedom, and the future of our civilization. 
Make no mistake - our civil liberties, especially as they pertain to 
digital communications, are being quickly eroded. There are countless 
examples in recent days, of governments and corporations that have taken
 it upon themself to police and regulate the transmission of data on 
political grounds. From the Great Firewall of China, to the Egyptian 
blackout of the network, to Bay Area Rapid Tranit's cellular shutdown, 
to the silent and insidious use of Deep Packet Inspection that is 
practiced in secret by many of our Internet Service 
Providers - the signs of erosion are all around us. We have only to take
 heed.
In response to these developments, we're building and deploying open 
source hardware and software solutions that allow people to 
cooperatively own and operate networks. These networks have the 
intelligence to route local traffic locally, without using the global 
internet - that way, there's never the opportunity for snooping.We won't go into technical details here. The specifics of our architecture are available here if you would like to know more. In essence, though, we are developing three pieces of technology that will enable people to grow their own networks - connected to the Internet, but capable of operating autonomously. The first is FreedomNode, a small-form, low-power server that would enable a household to own their own data, and connect to the Free Network. The second is FreedomTower, which connects FreedomNodes together at a neighborhood level, allowing communities to form Internet co-ops. The third is FreedomLink, which connects FreedomTowers together so that the cooperative purchasing of bandwidth can grow.Where We Come From
I 
 can't speak for everyone, but I'll tell you my story. I'm Isaac - the  
co-founder and Executive Director of the Free Network Foundation. I've 
been a geek  all my life, but I realized that I wanted to dedicate my 
life to  building a better network when I travelled to Cuba in the 
summer of  2010. Faced with a nation with virtually no network access, I
 realized  that the network we so often take for granted is a vital, 
precious, fragile thing. When I returned to Grinnell College that
 fall, I got together  with some colleagues and mentors to talk about 
network technologies.  What emerged was the Free Network Movement, and 
together we set out to  learn about how the Internet works, and envision
 ways in which it could  be improved. On that journey of discovery, I 
met Charles Wyble - we knew from our first encounter that we shared a 
vision - that of a network owned by everyone and no one at the same 
time. In
 May of 2011, we incorporated the Free Network Foundation as a  
non-profit, and applied for tax-exempt status. I decided that I would  
leave school to pursue my passion for distributed networks full time.  
Charles committed his time, resources, connections, and expertise. We  
both invested our life savings in the enterprise.



Eventually, my travels  led me to Occupy Wall Street. We 
 knew that it was time to put up or shut up - all of a sudden, there 
was  a real need for the technologies we had been cooking up. In two 
weeks,  we designed, built, and tested the first two FreedomTowers. Now 
there  are towers in use at Occupy Wall Street, Occupy Austin, and 
Occupy LA  with the number set to double in the next few weeks. These 
towers don't  just provide Internet access to the occupiers. They are 
designed to run  services locally, so that information destined for the 
other side of the  park doesn't have to travel several thousand miles. 
They serve as  uplinks to a Virtual Private Network, so that 
communications between  occupations can't be intercepted. Rain, snow, 
cold, hot - FreedomTowers will keep us connected as we do  the important
 work of restoring our democracy, and bringing our  civilization back 
into harmony with mother earth.


On
 the 20th of  October, we participated in the first Contact Conference, 
of whose mailing list our  partnership was born. Folks there took a great liking to 
the  FreedomTower, and to the FNF's roadmap for liberating the Internet.
 They  awarded us with one of three Contact Innovation Prizes, 
including  $10,000 towards our campaign here at IndieGoGo. Now we're 
here, asking  you to help us in our struggle to make a freer network.

Which product line should I buy, the Basic or the Premium?<br/></span></b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">This really depends on your home, and how you'd like to use MyBells. If you have a one bedroom apartment, then the Basic is enough for you. If you live in a family house or a larger apartment, then we recommend purchasing the family edition. If you'd like to use the instant snapshot and the live feed functions and have a touchscreen central device, chose the premium product line. If you are only interested in the adaptive bells, chose the basic product line.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>II. The amount of speakers in any package is not enough for me! What should I do?<br/></b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We have created 2 perks for you, so that you can add speakers to your system. Select the 'Additional Regular Speaker' to add a regular speaker, and the 'Additional Waterproof Speaker' to add a waterproof speaker to your system. We will send the extra speakers with your original perk, and we'll add no extra shipping cost.<br/></span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><i>Note: You can only have up to 10 speakers in one system.</i></span></p>
<p><b>III. Can I buy a MyBells for my office or second home?<br/></b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Yes, of course! You can have more than one system connected to your smartphone.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/108644/files/20131002084640-2-shipping.jpg?1380728800"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>I. What are the shipping costs?<br/></b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">All shipping in the USA is free of charge! There is an additional shipping cost for international shipments. The shipping cost does not include any extra fees or customs tax that might occur when shipping to your country. If the shipping cost turns out to be impossible or way too expensive we'll contact you, and you may request a refund from us.</span></p>
<p><b>II. When will I be able to use MyBells in my home?<br/></b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Our estimated shipping dates will begin from April, 2014. It is in our interest too, to get you your product as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/108647/files/20131002084724-3-setup_technical.jpg?1380728844"" src="""" style=""""/><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I. How do I set up the product? Can I do it myself?<br/></b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The set up will be really easy, and anyone, who knows how to navigate on a smartphone will be able to install the system! First you'll have to download the MyBells app from the Android Market/ App Store/ Windows Phone Store. Connect the devices to the internet, and do some configuration. Installation shouldn't take more than 15-30 minutes, depending on the size of package you're </span>purchasing<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">. A product manual with detailed installation description will be provided in your package. Also we will upload video tutorials on how to set-up the system.</span><br/><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Note: Minimal cabling may be required if you do not have a buzzer or a bell located in your home or if you chose the premium product line, and don't have a videophone in your apartment. If you will have any problems, you can always contact us so we can help you.</i></p>
<p><b>II. Can I place the speakers on the wall?<br/></b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Sure! You can have it stand on a table or shelf, but if you wish you may hang it on the wall. We'll add the screws and stuff, all you'll need is a screwdriver and sockets to plug the devices in. </span></p>
<p><b>III. Where should I place the central device or the hub? <br/></b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">You may place it anywhere inside the house, but to avoid cabling, it is the easiest to place it near the entrance. </span></p>
<p><b>IV. Will I be able to manage the second system from the same phone? Can I use multiple phones?<br/></b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Absolutely! You may use multiple phones for one system, and have multiple systems connected to one phone.</span></p>
<p><b>V: How is MyBells powered? What happens if the WiFi, or the power goes down? <br/></b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">MyBells needs to be plugged-in in order to work. This is needed in order for it to produce a high volume, that can even overcome a loud house party and the Siren Mode to work. The live-feed and the instant snapshot option is unavailable for the time the WiFi is down. If this happens, you'll receive a notification on your smartphone that the system is out of reach.</span></p>
<p><b>VI: I'm listening to music with my headphones on, and there is quiet inside! How will I hear that someone rang the bell? <br/></b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">MyBells will always measure the noise level in the room it is placed in before it starts ringing. In the App you may select an option when the ringing volume will increase over time so eventually, you'll hear the bell (not recommended when younglings are in the apartment). Alternatively you'll also receive a notification on your phone that the bell is rang.</span></p>
<p><b>VII: If I go away, may I use it as a security device?<br/></b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">In a way, yes, if you turn the MyBells into security mode. If one presses the bell, the speakers first start ringing the normal ringtone, but in a short time they would start playing something else of your choice, like an angry dog barking, etc. Using the live feedback and your smartphone you can remotely turn on the siren mode. Using this function all speakers will start to scream as loud as possible, making a potential robbery or intrusion a nightmare. </span></p>

<p><b>II. My neighbor and I are both buying MyBells! Will mine ring, when my neighbor's bell is rang? <br/></b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Absolutely, no way! Although the speakers will be connected to the hub or the central device wireless, the two system will be on a different channel, using different encryption and there is possibly no way that this could ever happen.</span></p>

It contains a built-in noise detector, so that it rings loud when needed, but quiet, when not. From now on, you'll hear the bell if when you're listening to loud music or when you're taking a shower. On the other hand, it'll not rouse you up from your best dream, because when there is quiet, MyBells will play your selected tune quietly.


You can configure your MyBells Speakers with the Free MyBells App! The App will be available for Android and iOS smartphones and tablets and also on Windows Phone! 





Upload your own music or select one of the many pre-installed tunes. 
Someone shows up at your home and you're not at home? Not a problem! MyBells will send you the picture of the person that rang on your door. You may log in and take a peek with the live feed feature! Also, talk to people standing at your door in real-time, while you're not even at home! (WiFi or 3G on your phone is needed. Only available at the premium product line).
Turn MyBells into a security device! When you go away for a longer period of time switch MyBells into Security Mode. When someone rings your home some frightening sound, such angry dog bark would be played from inside the house. Or if you noticed with the instant snapshot or the live feed that burglars checked if you are home, turn on the Siren Mode, and any burglars would run in fear from all speakers screaming at the highest volume possible!







The dark blue LED lights show the current noise level of your room. The higher the noise level, the more LEDs light up. There are in total 7 LEDs. We recommend this product for elderly people with hearing problems too. The intensity of the speakers and therefore the starting ringing volume is adjustable on a scale of 10, where 1 is the lightest and 10 is the most intense. 
The MyBells logo blinks for some time after the bell or the intercom is pressed. Just in case you were not sure if somebody rang. Configure this setting from the Free mobile app too. Change the frequency and length of the blinks.







Connect all your speakers on the same WiFi network and use MyBells as a music player for your whole apartment/house to play local media from your smartphone and tablet. Use it even on your PC or notebook (Windows, Mac OS or Linux) to send out a wireless audio stream to the entire speaker system placed in your home. 
From the app and the computer program select which speakers should play your music, its all up to you. 
When someone rings in, the music stops automatically and will only restart when you allow it to do so. 
Note: Feature will only be available from May / June, 2014. 





Place your Central Device next to your door or in your living room, and see who is calling at all times. This 7 inch touchscreen device would be a beautiful addition to your home. The central device is placed on a wall holder. For everyone in the family to be comfortable viewing the screen, the central device can rotate up and down up to 30 degrees, making the screen visible for everyone, disregarding their height.

<div> </div></div>","What is the HubDesk Desktop?
A HubDesk Desktop is an affordable, easy to use, hosted PC running a comprehensive suite of open source office software.  
A HubDesk Desktop Saves You Money...
Don't buy another laptop or an UltraBook!  Turn a $100 - $200 tablet into the ultimate convertible ultrabook by adding a keyboard, a mouse and maybe a big screen then connecting it to your remote HubDesk Desktop.
Don't pay for Office Apps!  We provide a full suite of office apps that are compatible with all your docs, spreadsheets and presentations.
HubDesk Saves you time ...
We host your PC, keep it running and provide the software you need for one low monthly fee.  We even help you get up and running quickly and offer DropBox and Evernote WebClipper setup support.
The Big Idea ... 
We are living in a 'Post PC' era in which the PC we really need is just another app we need to be able to run on our phone and / or tablet.  Ultimately the PC is an experience which needs to be able to run alongside our other apps on our mobile devices.  HubDesk is just that, it is there when you need it on any device.
Whether or not you are one of the 20 million people already using Ubuntu Linux each day, HubDesk is the easiest way to add this great operating system to your current devices without the need to dual boot or install anything but one simple app.  
If you are new to Linux and open source but have always wondered if open source office software could meet your desktop computing needs, HubDesk Desktop is a simple way to try out a collection of programs which could save you hundreds of dollars over equivalent commercial software titles while offering compatibility with all common document formats for office and graphics work.
Many of us use several devices daily to check email, view documents and collaborate with our peers using apps like Evernote, DropBox, BaseCamp and Google Apps.  Adding HubDesk to the mix means you have an easy way to work on all your devices as you would on any computer.  For example, you can edit documents stored in DropBox folders - just by opening and saving a change - and you can add web clippings to EverNote or run Web Apps on any device using a full desktop version of Firefox. 
Terminal Services and Remote Desktop Server access have traditionally been difficult to implement securely and expensive to license per user and per device.  A HubDesk desktop replaces expensive Remote Desktop Services hardware and software with an on-demand desktop you can access for personal or business use.
HubDesk does not add license fees per device and is designed to be used with many of the free RDP client apps already available on any SmartPhone, Tablet, Chromebook or PC.

The idea for HubDesk originally came from trying to use an iPad as a laptop replacement.  Tablets like the iPad and Nexus 7 are really good at most of the things we used to need a laptop for, but the constraints of the mobile browser, the limited functionality of the mobile office apps and the difficulty editing documents stored in DropBox makes the tablet feel like an 80% solution.
HubDesk was created to fill this gap.  Our mission when we set out was to provide the functionality, guidance and support anyone might need to work on any tablet as they would on a laptop.  Simplifying access to a simple, secure, hosted, open source desktop has an additional benefit.  The HubDesk Desktop makes it easy for anyone to experiment with and experience the benefits of an open source operating system and productivity software.

Your Phone can be your Computer...
As smartphone technology has advanced HubDesk has evolved to become more than a laptop replacement focused on the iPad or Android tablets.  Advances in Android Smartphones such as mouse support and screen mirroring means that anyone can now turn the current generation of smartphone devices such as the Nexus, Galaxy S3, Note II and S4 into a powerful mobile or desktop computer - simply by connecting a keyboard & mouse and signing on to their HubDesk Desktop. 
 
We Run on HubDesk...
We use HubDesk everyday to run our business.  For example, we used InkScape running on HubDesk on a Nexus 7 to create our logo and FireFox running on HubDesk using a ChromeBook to compose this IndieGoGo campaign.  

 

We know from experience that running HubDesk on a tablet or phone along with a full size keyboard and mouse means you really can lighten your load and leave your laptop at home.

 

Adding a full size monitor to the setup means you can even replace your desktop PC with your phone or tablet running the HubDesk Desktop.

 
The configurations offered in the perks are performance tested and designed to provide the optimal user experience for the lowest cost.  We have additional configurations available if you require more RAM per user or need to run large apps but the perks you see offer an optimal combination of SSD storage, CPU and RAM to deliver the performance you need to run our core desktop.
 
 
What We Need …
 
We need your interest and support.  If you think a HubDesk Desktop will enhance your lifestyle, please let us know and just as importantly please let your friends know about us and our project.  Please “Share” the IndieGOGO page and “shout out” about us using #HubDesk.
 
Your support and your referrals (“shares”, “likes”,etc..)  are changing the world and that is why we chose to tell you about our idea first. 
 
Try it out!  We are happy using our own service as it is, but we really need your feedback.  You can try it out with a friend and a secure guest account for as little as $20 for one month.  We believe HubDesk will change the way you think about what a PC can be.
 
 
What's Next ...
 
Our test systems are in place and we have partnered with 'best in class' co-location and hosting services for our production systems, so the dollars we raise in this campaign will be used mainly to add capacity and support staff to our West Coast Helpdesk.
 
We are launching with an Ubuntu based desktop but if our customers request it we can add Red Hat and Debian based services.
 
More software...  Our core desktop has all of the essential office software titles we need but it can be configured with industry specific software.  For instance, there are well supported open source Accounting, ERP and Practice Management systems we can add today.  We will add additional software to vertical specific business desktops as requested.
 
More Languages... We are already working on Spanish and French versions of the desktop and support materials.  We will add more languages as they are requested.
 
Our Goal is Simple ...  
 
We want to show the world how easy it is to use a great, open source desktop on any smartphone, tablet, or PC.  
 
Thank you for reading this far.  Please take a look at our perks. We look forward to helping you get started using your HubDesk Desktop.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We started to develop Sinji Grip back in January 2018 and have been continuously working on finding the best materials to make Sinji Grip not only useful but also a design piece.</p>
<p>Since we have been producing smartphone accessories for almost 10 years now, we know the production process well and are familiar with the companies that produce them for us. And we have already started producing the first batch of our Sinji Grip!</p>
<p>Therefore we are confident that we can start packing and shipping at the end of June!</p>
<p>However, since we do not know exactly how many Sinji Grip we will need, we cannot guarantee when you will receive your own Sinji Grip yet. But once we ship it out, you will get it within two to three weeks!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>FAQ's</h2>
<p>Q. Can Sinji Grip be used with all smartphones?</p>
<p>A. In general, you can use Sinji Grip with all smart devices that do not have a curved back! If you have a smartphone with a back made out of glass (iPhone 8,8 plus, X or Samsung Galaxy S9/S9 plus) then the 3M tape might not stick well to the surface - that is why we included the additional adhesive film, so you can strengthen adhesiveness and use Sinji Grip without worries!</p>
<p>Q. What is the additional adhesive film and why do I need it?</p>
<p>A. As mentioned before, if you have a phone with a glass back (most flagship phones in 2018), then the 3M tape alone might not guarantee perfect adhesion. That is why we included an additional adhesive film to strengthen the adhesiveness and make sure you can feel comfortable when you use Sinji Grip! Simply put the additional adhesive film in between your phone and Sinji Grip and you are ready to go!</p>
<p>Q. Can I use Sinji Grip as a stand for my tablet PC as well?</p>
<p>A. You can use Sinji Grip as a smartphone stand but most tablet Pcs will be too big or heavy to stand up well with Sinji Grip. If your tablet PC is very small and light it might work but we recommend to use that function only for your smartphone!</p>

<h2><strong>HOW IS VIVAINNOVA'S SlimTester DIFFERENT?</strong></h2>
<p>SlimTester is REVOLUTIONARY</p>
<p>The battery tester is a crystal clear example of a new electronic devices generation that will revolutionize our daily lives.</p>
<p>Printed Electronic Technology makes sophisticated devices accessible to everyone, and it takes beyond the classic electronics industry.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><em>PRINTED ELECTRONIC</em></h3>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>TECHNOLOGY</em></h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Printed &amp; organic electronics is a novel technique for designing and manufacturing electronic devices. Making use of graphic techniques, functional inks (nanoparticles based inks) are deposited on flexible materials such as plastic, paper or tissue.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">The technology developed by Vivainnova allows soldering electronic components on a plastic sheet joining the advantages of both technologies: Printing on the one hand (roll-to-roll, flexible, flatness, ...), and soldering high performance conventional components (microprocessors, diodes, ...) on the other hand.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">The result is a cutting edge technology that you shouldn´t miss out on. Through SlimTester funding campaign, you can get a unique device that opens a new electronic age.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>ECOLOGICAL</em></h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">SlimTester sets to parallel the expected trends in the coming decades: Electric vehicles, clean energy and renewable power sources.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Printed electronics is more ecological technology than the conventional one, as it uses less aggressive materials to reduce the impact on the environment.</p>

In various situations, identifying if your battery works well can be very helpful.

 
HOW IS VIVAINNOVA'S SlimTester DIFFERENT?
SlimTester is REVOLUTIONARY
The battery tester is a crystal clear example of a new electronic devices generation that will revolutionize our daily lives.
Printed Electronic Technology makes sophisticated devices accessible to everyone, and it takes beyond the classic electronics industry.
 
PRINTED ELECTRONIC
TECHNOLOGY
Printed & organic electronics is a novel technique for designing and manufacturing electronic devices. Making use of graphic techniques, functional inks (nanoparticles based inks) are deposited on flexible materials such as plastic, paper or tissue.
The technology developed by Vivainnova allows soldering electronic components on a plastic sheet joining the advantages of both technologies: Printing on the one hand (roll-to-roll, flexible, flatness, ...), and soldering high performance conventional components (microprocessors, diodes, ...) on the other hand.
The result is a cutting edge technology that you shouldn´t miss out on. Through SlimTester funding campaign, you can get a unique device that opens a new electronic age.
 
ECOLOGICAL
SlimTester sets to parallel the expected trends in the coming decades: Electric vehicles, clean energy and renewable power sources.
Printed electronics is more ecological technology than the conventional one, as it uses less aggressive materials to reduce the impact on the environment.
 
 
HOW DOES VIVAINNOVA'S SlimTester WORK?
Fully manageable and very easy to use by any user, without any previous technical experience.
User instructions:
1) Extend the product. Hold the device by the both ends.
2) Place the product on the battery and press on the terminals.
3) The battery level will be shown in the display.

 
WHY DOES SOMEONE NEED A SlimTester?
One of the most common causes of car’s breakdowns is battery flat or fault. The key to avoid a breakdown is good and regular maintenance. Many can be fixed at the roadside, but most can be avoided with the correct preventive care.

«SlimTester can be carried in the glove compartment with very little wasted space. When electrical problems in the vehicle are detected, or simply the battery status wants to be checked ahead of a possible replacement due to age or deterioration, SlimTester comes in an useful instrument in preventing surprises and unpleasant incidents to the driver»

<h2>Being a superhero with Glass</h2>
<p>We believe Glass is a game changer. It's all about making technology fit in our daily lives and enhance our experiences, not get in the way. We want to make technology useful and provide real life benefits. For Glass, the user experience and interaction with Glass is clearly a challenge. If we get it right, Glass will provide superhero powers. <strong>Tiki’Labs is committed to bring its own piece of magic to the Google Glass experience.</strong></p>
<p>Of course, like anyone else, we are not sure how Glass will evolve or even if it will truly live up to the expectations. But we do have a vision of how we could contribute to making it magic and make people feel like superheroes. Your contribution will enable us to <strong>build Glass products that people will love.</strong></p>
<h3>The challenge</h3>
<p><strong> </strong>... But what if the magic breaks ? In many situations, interacting with Glass can be either confusing, embarrassing, or simply not practical. Glass is activated by tapping the Google Mirror on the side of Glass with one finger. Slide the finger to select content on the timeline, or activate Glass by saying “Ok Glass”.</p>
<p>Voice interactions are limitating and could be confusing : </p>
<ul>
<li>when you can't speak</li>
<li>Glass could be activated and controlled by anyone</li>
<li>finding the info is not easy, especially in buisy/noisy environments</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Designing a perfect user experience requires an interface that provides seemless connection with the technology</strong>. Tiki'Labs patented an interface solution that we believe can be the best way to activate and use Google Glass. </p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>The 6 key Tiki'pad solution</h2>
<p>We have developed a technology that would change the Glass experience. It consists of a small 6 digit keyboard that gives direct access to 36 contents.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 90px;""><img alt=""Tiki'Pad is a 6 digit keyboard with real keys or touch zones"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img690.imageshack.us/img690/1900/6keys2.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Tiki'Pad is a 6 digit keyboard with real keys or touch zones""/></p>
<p>After years of R&amp;D, building prototypes and products on mobile platforms including with famous French  school of engineering ESME SUDRIA (ARITT n°09-062), we achieved the user experience we wanted on text entry, content navigation, instant geolocalisation. Our aim is now to bring this user experience to Glass.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 60px;""><img alt=""Prototype project of hardware Tikipad ESME SUDRIA"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img163.imageshack.us/img163/2383/prototypeesme.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Prototype project of hardware Tikipad ESME SUDRIA""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>The 6 key Tiki'pad works on any touch surface of any dimensions, down to the size of a coin. The chord keyboard feature, allows direct access to 36 results, each with a single gesture.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 60px;""><img alt=""Tiki'Pad software touch engine has a flexible patented architecture"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img832.imageshack.us/img832/3650/6keys.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The Tiki'pad requires half the size of traditional keypads, advantageously replacing Qwerty, optimizing the size of any mobile device touch screen.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 60px;""><img alt=""Tiki'Pad works easily with only one hand"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img825.imageshack.us/img825/8386/flexible1.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Tiki'Pad works easily with only one hand""/></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 60px;""><img alt=""Tiki'Pad works with two hands with one or several fingers"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img832.imageshack.us/img832/5003/felxible2.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Tiki'Pad works with two hands with one or several fingers""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Since the keys are large, this entry method is very reliable: visual feedback can be displayed into Glass. The rate of error is reduced from traditional keyboards, even at high speed texting.</p>
<p>We will propose various options to interact with Glass:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 60px;""><img alt=""various activation possibilities to match your habits and context"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img841.imageshack.us/img841/1716/felxible3.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""various activation possibilities to match your habits and context""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Tiki'pad app on Glass</h3>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><img alt=""Tiki'pad connects to the glasses through bluetooth connexion"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img833.imageshack.us/img833/7127/image2gb.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Tiki'pad connects to the glasses through bluetooth connexion""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>A free app will run on any smartphone with Bluetooth connexion to Glass (first versions will be developed on android) – the app will turn the screen into an active touch pad to interact with Glass. A small keyboard will be added in the vision field that replicates the finger moves over the touch surface of the smartphone. </p>
<p>They will maintain a Bluetooth connexion with Glass and serve as remote keypad. This provides added benefits such as the ability to carry additional battery, physical buttons that can be programmed to facilitate  actions, and storage abilities. The most advanced will have a sim (so that you can use them without any smartphone), nfc chipset, and a magnetic side so that you can clip them anywhere.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 60px;""><img alt=""the full version of Tiki'pad will hold a Sim card for 3G ans SD card for storage and can be clipped on various supports thanks to the magnetic side"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img254.imageshack.us/img254/5531/capturedcran20130515170.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""the full version of Tiki'pad will hold a Sim card for 3G ans SD card for storage and can be clipped on various supports thanks to the magnetic side""/></p>
<p>  </p>
<p>The benefits are:</p>
<ul>
<li>multi task (text entry, navigation, command)</li>
<li>very fast, easy and reliable input</li>
<li>works on very small surface like Mirror</li>
<li>no need to see the keyboard (or any visual feedback)</li>
<li>discreet interaction</li>
</ul>
<p>Our technology is best applied in constrained contexts where users don’t have big screen or need to have their hands free. Chord keyboard provides real interaction capabilities like short discussion, multi-level navigation, filtering information or archiving for later use. </p>
<p><strong>Designing the most efficient interface allows us to bring value to Glass and help keep the magic of technology alive.</strong> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Use cases</h3>
<p>The 6 keys Tiki'pad will allow Glass users to:</p>
<ul>
<li>discreetly answer short messages, launch complex commands, search through directories </li>
<li>reducing the number of steps to get to the desired content</li>
<li>customize the interface with preferred sequences </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Switch easily between 6 key cards and activate services or type text "" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img850.imageshack.us/img850/6488/landingb.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Switch easily between 6 key cards and activate services or type text ""/> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Beyond Glass and other models of connected glasses, the Tiki'pad remote will connect to your digital environment and bring new benefits in many situations :</p>
<ul>
<li>to bring augmented reality experience and rich interaction to any connected device with camera (within a car, on a sport cam, security cam, military flight helmet, binoculars..)</li>
<li>to navigate rich contents on a connected TV </li>
<li>enabling users to control “the internet of things” </li>
</ul>
<p>Acting as a real universal wallet, the Tiki'pad wil also take care of wireless payments via NFC</p>

<h3>Timeline of the Tiki'pad project</h3>
<p>Thanks to your support, we will build innovative and reliable technology.</p>
<p>-       first step : application to interact with Glass through a phone.

Being a superhero with Glass
We believe Glass is a game changer. It's all about making technology fit in our daily lives and enhance our experiences, not get in the way. We want to make technology useful and provide real life benefits. For Glass, the user experience and interaction with Glass is clearly a challenge. If we get it right, Glass will provide superhero powers. Tiki’Labs is committed to bring its own piece of magic to the Google Glass experience.
Of course, like anyone else, we are not sure how Glass will evolve or even if it will truly live up to the expectations. But we do have a vision of how we could contribute to making it magic and make people feel like superheroes. Your contribution will enable us to build Glass products that people will love.
The challenge
 ... But what if the magic breaks ? In many situations, interacting with Glass can be either confusing, embarrassing, or simply not practical. Glass is activated by tapping the Google Mirror on the side of Glass with one finger. Slide the finger to select content on the timeline, or activate Glass by saying “Ok Glass”.
Voice interactions are limitating and could be confusing : 

when you can't speak
Glass could be activated and controlled by anyone
finding the info is not easy, especially in buisy/noisy environments

Designing a perfect user experience requires an interface that provides seemless connection with the technology. Tiki'Labs patented an interface solution that we believe can be the best way to activate and use Google Glass. 
 
The 6 key Tiki'pad solution
We have developed a technology that would change the Glass experience. It consists of a small 6 digit keyboard that gives direct access to 36 contents.

After years of R&D, building prototypes and products on mobile platforms including with famous French  school of engineering ESME SUDRIA (ARITT n°09-062), we achieved the user experience we wanted on text entry, content navigation, instant geolocalisation. Our aim is now to bring this user experience to Glass.
 

 
 
How does it work?
The 6 key Tiki'pad works on any touch surface of any dimensions, down to the size of a coin. The chord keyboard feature, allows direct access to 36 results, each with a single gesture.

The Tiki'pad requires half the size of traditional keypads, advantageously replacing Qwerty, optimizing the size of any mobile device touch screen.


 
Since the keys are large, this entry method is very reliable: visual feedback can be displayed into Glass. The rate of error is reduced from traditional keyboards, even at high speed texting.
We will propose various options to interact with Glass:
 

 
The Tiki'pad app on Glass
 

 
A free app will run on any smartphone with Bluetooth connexion to Glass (first versions will be developed on android) – the app will turn the screen into an active touch pad to interact with Glass. A small keyboard will be added in the vision field that replicates the finger moves over the touch surface of the smartphone. 
They will maintain a Bluetooth connexion with Glass and serve as remote keypad. This provides added benefits such as the ability to carry additional battery, physical buttons that can be programmed to facilitate  actions, and storage abilities. The most advanced will have a sim (so that you can use them without any smartphone), nfc chipset, and a magnetic side so that you can clip them anywhere.
 

  
The benefits are:

multi task (text entry, navigation, command)
very fast, easy and reliable input
works on very small surface like Mirror
no need to see the keyboard (or any visual feedback)
discreet interaction

Our technology is best applied in constrained contexts where users don’t have big screen or need to have their hands free. Chord keyboard provides real interaction capabilities like short discussion, multi-level navigation, filtering information or archiving for later use. 
Designing the most efficient interface allows us to bring value to Glass and help keep the magic of technology alive. 
 
Use cases
The 6 keys Tiki'pad will allow Glass users to:

discreetly answer short messages, launch complex commands, search through directories 
reducing the number of steps to get to the desired content
customize the interface with preferred sequences 

 
 
 
Beyond Glass and other models of connected glasses, the Tiki'pad remote will connect to your digital environment and bring new benefits in many situations :

to bring augmented reality experience and rich interaction to any connected device with camera (within a car, on a sport cam, security cam, military flight helmet, binoculars..)
to navigate rich contents on a connected TV 
enabling users to control “the internet of things” 

Acting as a real universal wallet, the Tiki'pad wil also take care of wireless payments via NFC
 


 
Timeline of the Tiki'pad project
Thanks to your support, we will build innovative and reliable technology.
-       first step : application to interact with Glass through a phone. Based on our existing tiki6keys engine and compliant with Glass OS.  15000€ and four months are  needed. Note that even if you don't have a Glass (like almost everyody on earth at this time), you can use the photo camera of your smartphone to simulate them and get the same options as you will get with Glass (like Google Goggles).
-       second step : open API for third party developers that will take advantage of the 6 key interaction for their own services. We will provide support to this community of developers who want to rock the Glass world! 20000€ and 2 additional months are needed.
-       third step : prototype of physical keypads. Our goal is to produce a small pad with a sim, sd card for storage and a magnetic side to clip it. Additional fundings will allow us to build the first working prototypes for early 2014 and expect to launch first before Q2 2014.
 
 
 
-       In the meantime and thanks to your initial support we will be happy to partner and work with designers, manufacturers, distributors.
 
What is in there for you
Most of all, you will be part of an exciting project: giving a new ability to human beings and helping them feel like superheroes in their daily life !
And when we say you will be part of, we mean that we really want you to contribute, from the beginning and all the way along. You will: 

be given access to alpha and beta versions 
be able to share your new superpowers in social media channel 
have access to a community of enthusiastic developers and users

<p>Man-kind has been wishing for the power to create intangible illusion or display of objects since ancient times. Recently, technology was advancing at such a speed that we transitioned from the traditional CRT, to LCD, the popular 3D display, novel head mounted display, and further move towards holographic display, transparent display, and flexible display, etc. Each revolution along the way is a reflection of our wisdom and creativity. It is also a proof that people’s innovation is always beyond their imagination. Technology, by its definition, should bring convenience and experiences to people without the sacrifice of becoming difficult or complicated. In the field of display, one question has raised to the top: how do we balance the need for high-definition, large-screen viewing experience with the need for ultimate mobility? This is the mission for Royole-X, as well as our rollable flexible display and touch technologies, to break such trade-off, to serve this part of human nature.</p>
<p>At Royole, we do not predict the future, we invent the future!</p>

While we look at Royole-X today, this is what makes it unique from inside out. Achieving the target is never easy. From the inception of the idea, to the 6th version of prototypes, to manufacturing on our production line, today we are very excited that Royole-X has successfully made it.We are proud to announce that with your help, Royole-X will be ready to be shipped in large volume to the United States in January 2016 and later to the world. Here we present Royole-X. See what you never saw.Key Features
3300 PPI - the world's finest display.Royole-X adopts groundbreaking display technology to enable the world's highest resolution display, with a pixel density of 3300 ppi, ~ 10X higher than advanced smartphone displays.

Our Vision


Man-kind has been wishing for the power to create intangible illusion or display of objects since ancient times. Recently, technology was advancing at such a speed that we transitioned from the traditional CRT, to LCD, the popular 3D display, novel head mounted display, and further move towards holographic display, transparent display, and flexible display, etc. Each revolution along the way is a reflection of our wisdom and creativity. It is also a proof that people’s innovation is always beyond their imagination. Technology, by its definition, should bring convenience and experiences to people without the sacrifice of becoming difficult or complicated. In the field of display, one question has raised to the top: how do we balance the need for high-definition, large-screen viewing experience with the need for ultimate mobility? This is the mission for Royole-X, as well as our rollable flexible display and touch technologies, to break such trade-off, to serve this part of human nature.
At Royole, we do not predict the future, we invent the future!

Our Promises


All the models shown in the videos, on the webpages were manufactured on our production line. At this point, we are ready to meet the estimated delivery schedule to customers in United States, and are currently ramping up the production volume every day to let Royole-X reach users worldwide as soon as possible. We will put all of our efforts to forecast demand and keep up with production plan and we will keep our supporters updated on any development of our production.
Over the past two years, we have assembled an experienced product team and established a reliable supply chain. However, unexpected shortages and delays of components can negatively affect our shipping schedule. On the slim chance that this happens, we will keep our supporters informed and work to quickly solve any issue.

</div> <p>Do you wish you had an Operating system that was better than Windows 7 or 8? Do you wish you had the option to actually talk to your computer and tell it what to do and what to type, instead of having to type those 1,000 word essays on your keyboard or read a very long eBook but you would rather it be read to you? The answer is finally here: IMPACT</p>
<p>IMPACT is the world most intelligent, advanced, and also the worlds first talking operating system! It also learns as you talk and use it. For example: If John wakes up every day at 8 A.M. for work and checks his email and the news before he goes, the computer will boot up and open up his online email or email client as well as his favorite news website, all before his alarm even goes off. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">The IMPACT system knows to do all of this because it taught itself that John does this every morning. This results in a great amount of time saved in John's morning.</span></p>

<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What's Under The Hood</h3> <p><b>Familiar Setup:</b></p>
<p>Whether your coming from Windows or from a Mac, IMPACT will be familiar to you. A Start-like menu is used that you will recognize immediately, and our state of the art searching feature is closely identical to Apple's Spotlight search function. We're very excited on how easy it will be to switch from a Windows or a Mac, to the IMPACT system.</p>
<p><b>Say Goodbye To Antivirus Software: </b></p>
<p>Because IMPACT's backbone is Linux, this means that you never have to worry about getting a virus again! In fact, you don't even need anti-spyware or anti-virus software!</p>
<p><b>Fully Customizable:</b></p>
<p>We have made an Operating System that will revolutionize the way we do work and play. Not only does it have all the customization options of a Mac and of Windows, but it has much more. Such as the ability to talk to it and learn from your previous behavior. Also, every single thing, including the little things, are customizable. From the cursor, to the way IMPACT boots up, and everything between and beyond your imagination, is customizable. </p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Absolutely 100% Free</h3> <p>The IMPACT Operating System is free. There are no hidden fees, blocked features, or trial period (and also no terrible trial software that comes with OS's like Windows). The software, optional updates, and necessary bug fixes are 100% free!</p>
<p><b>Free Apps:</b></p>
<p>The IMPACT system if free, and so are the apps! Every app you could possibly think of is available through the IMPACT system's app store, and a vast majority of them are free! New apps are being developed daily so there is no shortage of apps, and no limit to creativity!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Where The Idea Came From</h3> <p>The idea came when one day were were sitting at our computers, agitated at Windows 8. It wasn't built for desktops in our opinion, but for tablets. And even though we love Windows 7, we needed something more. Something smarter, something that knows your next move, something very interactive. And so, IMPACT was born.</p>
<p>We chose to have IMPACT's backbone as linux because it offers a tremendous amount of customization options, as well as great compatibility with users existing hardware. We look forward to continuously give back to the Linux Community to constantly say thank you.</p>

</div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Looking Towards The Future &amp; Beyond (Planned Features)</h3> <p>Some of the work we plan for the future involves improvement of the IMPACT system and it's features. But we are most excited about our powerful line of Compact Desktops and Notebooks. These computers will have the highest quality components, and be made out of the highest quality materials.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">We plan to release many more innovative and new products in the coming years, so stay tuned!</span><br/></p>

Because IMPACT's backbone is Linux, this means that you never have to worry about getting a virus again! In fact, you don't even need anti-spyware or anti-virus software!
Fully Customizable:
We have made an Operating System that will revolutionize the way we do work and play. Not only does it have all the customization options of a Mac and of Windows, but it has much more. Such as the ability to talk to it and learn from your previous behavior. Also, every single thing, including the little things, are customizable. From the cursor, to the way IMPACT boots up, and everything between and beyond your imagination, is customizable. 

  
Absolutely 100% Free The IMPACT Operating System is free. There are no hidden fees, blocked features, or trial period (and also no terrible trial software that comes with OS's like Windows). The software, optional updates, and necessary bug fixes are 100% free!
Free Apps:
The IMPACT system if free, and so are the apps! Every app you could possibly think of is available through the IMPACT system's app store, and a vast majority of them are free! New apps are being developed daily so there is no shortage of apps, and no limit to creativity!


  Where The Idea Came From The idea came when one day were were sitting at our computers, agitated at Windows 8. It wasn't built for desktops in our opinion, but for tablets. And even though we love Windows 7, we needed something more. Something smarter, something that knows your next move, something very interactive. And so, IMPACT was born.
We chose to have IMPACT's backbone as linux because it offers a tremendous amount of customization options, as well as great compatibility with users existing hardware. We look forward to continuously give back to the Linux Community to constantly say thank you.

  
Looking Towards The Future & Beyond (Planned Features) Some of the work we plan for the future involves improvement of the IMPACT system and it's features. But we are most excited about our powerful line of Compact Desktops and Notebooks. These computers will have the highest quality components, and be made out of the highest quality materials.
We plan to release many more innovative and new products in the coming years, so stay tuned!",1.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<br/><p></p>
<p>What is the
extra charge for shipping?</p>
<p>We will be
using FedEX for order outside of the USA or Hong Kong and that costs money. For
this reason, we will need to charge a small additional shipping fee for
international orders.</p>
<p>Can the new
HyperPort charge the Apple Watch?</p>
<p>Yes, during our R&amp;D stages, the LithiumCard PRO's (with the Apple Lightning connector), HyperPort was exclusively designed to HyperCharge the new Apple Watch. However, the HyperPort also has the HyperFET Gen 2 circuitry to HyperCharge virtually any mobile device in the market as well.<br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Can the LithiumCard
PRO charge my iPhone and other Apple iOS devices?</span><br/></p>
<p>Yes, the
LithiumCard PRO with Lightning connector can charge iPhone 5, iPhone 5C, iPhone
5S, iPhone 6, and iPhone 6 PLUS. It can also charge iPod Touch 5<sup>th</sup>
Generation, iPad AIR, iPad AIR 2, iPad mini, iPad mini Retina</p>
<p>Can the
LithiumCard charge my Android phone?</p>
<p>Yes, the
LithiumCard PRO with microUSB connector can charge most Android phones
available today such as the Samsung Galaxy Series, Motorola Droid, etc</p>
<p>How much
extra capacity can I expect to achieve when using a fully charged LithiumCard
PRO to add to my mobile device?</p>
<p>Using the
simple formula below, you can approximate the amount of additional capacity to
the device you are charging. For example, using an iPhone 6 with its 1,810mAh
internal battery, the results will be:</p>
<p>Extra
capacity = [2310/(your device battery capacity)] x 100%</p>
<p>iPhone 6
extra capacity = [2310/1810] x 100 = 127% extra capacity </p>
<p>How
efficient is the LithiumCard PRO?</p>
<p>The
Engineers at LinearFlux have further advanced the efficiency technology.
Typical accepted industry efficiency for premium portable chargers is about
70%. However, with our latest Gen 2 HyperFET charging circuitry, we have pushed
the envelope to deliver up to 80-85% efficiency!</p>
<p>How long
does it take to recharge the LithiumCard PRO?</p>
<p>The
LithiumCard PRO will charge faster with stronger powered USB ports. For
example, the PRO using an Apple 1A (5W) charger will take about 3 hours to
charge. However, using an Apple 2.4A (12W) charger will take considerably less
than 90 minutes. For best charging results, charge the LithiumCard PRO with the
LinearFlux HyperCharging Hub for even faster charging times.</p>
<p>What is the
estimated delivery date?</p>
<p>Barring any
type of production issues. We expect the delivery of the LithiumCard PRO to
start late April through early May 2015.</p>
<p>Once I order
can I change the connector type or color of LithiumCard PRO?</p>
<p>Yes, you
will need to contact us directly at <a href=""mailto:orders@linearflux.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">orders@linearflux.com</a> However, please expect some delays as these will need to be changed
manually by our staff.</p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Initially our R&amp;D team we pursued this idea but with various charging profiles for Apple and Android we wanted to make certain that our HyperCharging Gen2 circuitry was tuned for each application. In addition, there's not one bit of extra real estate inside the PRO circuitry to allow for extra features. Every square inch has been maximized. For this reason, we created a HyperPort, just in case a user wanted to charge a device different from the native connector.<br/></span></p>

LithiumCard PRO is available in either Apple Lightning, or microUSB, connectors. The microUSB connector works with many Android smartphones available today. The Apple Lightning connector works with all Apple iOS devices requiring a Lightning connector to charge. *Apple Lightning and microUSB versions are sold separately——— Backing up your smartphone's data to your computer has never been easier. There's no need to carry another separate cable for syncing data to your computer ever again. The PRO does it all.——— 




SIMULTANEOUS CHARGING.

If both your phone and the LithiumCard are out of charge, we have a unique bypass charging system, which allows you to simultaneously charge a smartphone and the LithiumCard's internal battery.——— 

CHARGE EVERYTHING.

LithiumCard charges most popular smartphones and electronic devices available today, such as Beats Wireless headphones or Jawbone Jambox. It has an Apple Lightning connector for your iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 PLUS, or a microUSB connector, for your Android phone.——— 

NANOSTIK.

Without using adhesives, NanoStik, utlizing nanosuction technology keeps the LithiumCard virtually stuck to your device. Over time, the NanoStik may get dirty, simply rinse with warm water to keep it at its maximum ""stickyness"".——— 
POWER LEVEL.
Pressing the power button also indicates LithiumCard's power level. The precision nano-refractive lens display will say it all.White: Over 90% chargedBlue: Over 10% chargedRed: Less than 10% charged.

FAQ

What is the
extra charge for shipping?
We will be
using FedEX for order outside of the USA or Hong Kong and that costs money. For
this reason, we will need to charge a small additional shipping fee for
international orders.
Can the new
HyperPort charge the Apple Watch?
Yes, during our R&D stages, the LithiumCard PRO's (with the Apple Lightning connector), HyperPort was exclusively designed to HyperCharge the new Apple Watch. However, the HyperPort also has the HyperFET Gen 2 circuitry to HyperCharge virtually any mobile device in the market as well.
Can the LithiumCard
PRO charge my iPhone and other Apple iOS devices?
Yes, the
LithiumCard PRO with Lightning connector can charge iPhone 5, iPhone 5C, iPhone
5S, iPhone 6, and iPhone 6 PLUS. It can also charge iPod Touch 5th
Generation, iPad AIR, iPad AIR 2, iPad mini, iPad mini Retina
Can the
LithiumCard charge my Android phone?
Yes, the
LithiumCard PRO with microUSB connector can charge most Android phones
available today such as the Samsung Galaxy Series, Motorola Droid, etc
How much
extra capacity can I expect to achieve when using a fully charged LithiumCard
PRO to add to my mobile device?
Using the
simple formula below, you can approximate the amount of additional capacity to
the device you are charging. For example, using an iPhone 6 with its 1,810mAh
internal battery, the results will be:
Extra
capacity = [2310/(your device battery capacity)] x 100%
iPhone 6
extra capacity = [2310/1810] x 100 = 127% extra capacity 
How
efficient is the LithiumCard PRO?
The
Engineers at LinearFlux have further advanced the efficiency technology.
Typical accepted industry efficiency for premium portable chargers is about
70%. However, with our latest Gen 2 HyperFET charging circuitry, we have pushed
the envelope to deliver up to 80-85% efficiency!
How long
does it take to recharge the LithiumCard PRO?
The
LithiumCard PRO will charge faster with stronger powered USB ports. For
example, the PRO using an Apple 1A (5W) charger will take about 3 hours to
charge. However, using an Apple 2.4A (12W) charger will take considerably less
than 90 minutes. For best charging results, charge the LithiumCard PRO with the
LinearFlux HyperCharging Hub for even faster charging times.
What is the
estimated delivery date?
Barring any
type of production issues. We expect the delivery of the LithiumCard PRO to
start late April through early May 2015.
Once I order
can I change the connector type or color of LithiumCard PRO?
Yes, you
will need to contact us directly at orders@linearflux.com However, please expect some delays as these will need to be changed
manually by our staff.
Why can't you offer both Lightning and microUSB option for the LithiumCard PRO?
Initially our R&D team we pursued this idea but with various charging profiles for Apple and Android we wanted to make certain that our HyperCharging Gen2 circuitry was tuned for each application. In addition, there's not one bit of extra real estate inside the PRO circuitry to allow for extra features. Every square inch has been maximized. For this reason, we created a HyperPort, just in case a user wanted to charge a device different from the native connector.",17.0,3,"3 Campaigns
