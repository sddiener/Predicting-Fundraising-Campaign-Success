(Just choose your colour) :-) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Disability Sans Frontieres (Disability Without Frontiers) is a new organisation that has been setup to launch the Health Card, USA, Great Britain, France, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, we have people waiting for this launch worldwide.I realised on a recent trip to Poland how hard it can be get help with disabilities when you cannot speak the language, I have Diabetes, Heart Failure, Sleep Apnoea and Arthritis, try saying those in Polish... and that visit opened my eyes to the need for the Health Card. How else could I prove I have a health conditions in a foreign country.In addition to this, each country has concessions for the disabled on transport, leisure facilities and more, but how can you access them without proving health issues, not without proof in their language, that they can understand.I hope that you can see the need for this too...... If you don't then ask your family and friends with disabilities the difficulties they face EVERY DAY and how they would ASK FOR HELP especially in a FOREIGN LANGUAGE.What if your child or grandchild became disabled.We NEED YOU to help launch this project.New statistics show in America alone there are 54.4 Million citizens with disabilities and serious health conditions, I am sure that you know some of them yourself.* 5 percent of children 5 to 17 have disabilities.* 10 percent of people 18 to 64 have disabilities.* 37 percent of adults 65 and older have disabilities.The Impact This Card Could HaveImagine what a difference this card will make to those with disabilities and hidden health conditions, including your own family and friends:
No more explaining that you need the toilet in a store because you have a bowel condition or take diuretics.
No more having to explain you have cancer or heart problems just to get a little help when you need it .
No more strange looks when you have to inject yourself because of your diabetes.
No more trying to explain what you need when you have speech problems.
No more explaining Tourettes / Aspergers / ADHD / Depression
Prove disability and access discounts on travel, leisure, culture worldwide.
A Card that need no explanation it can be identified in all countries easily.
Freedom to travel worldwide with no worries.
Men, Women and Children of all ages and health conditions can benefit from this card, your friends, family, neighbors and even YOU may need this card.The International Health Card both proves your identity and explains your condition clearly and simply, even when you travel abroad on vacation. If you have difficulty getting help at home just imagine how hard it can be to explain to someone who speak's another language that you need help.....You too could need this card someday.What We Need & What You GetTo launch we need the following:
A Responsive and Multilingual Website.
A Budget for promotional activity and leaflets.
Thousands of high security Freedom Cards pre printed to the highest quality to ensure the card safety and validity.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Support us on THUNDERCLAP toohttp://thndr.it/1i7qbQv---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------We are already some of the way getting this project off the ground, the Health Cards artwork has been professionally designed to bank note quality to prevent forgery. I am currently constructing the website myself and reputable commercial print companies have been sourced to complete the cards.. We just need YOU ! YOUR ! Help can make all the difference to this project and in return you can receive for yourself or friends and family their very own Freedom Card with anything upto LIFETIME REGISTRATION, Those supporting at the highest levels can have their name or company name and photo or logo prominently listed on the Health Card website disablility-sans-frontieres.org as a Guardian Angels.Disability Sans Frontieres will initially be based in London although we hope in the future to open offices in New York, Paris, Sydney and the Far East as support grows.The funding that we are seeking is minimal, it will allow us to start the project and build up press and social media interest and print the first few thousands cards..In addition we will be sending information to Doctors and Hospitals worldwide so that they can let patients know about the Health Card from that point we hope to have major corporate backing to have a truly global reach.We can make this happen only with YOUR HELP FOLK'SHow would you cope with a disability ? it's not easy.Other Ways You Can HelpSome people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help:

One of the biggest challenges both of our families found with autistic spectrum disorder is it can be difficult to ensure your child can stay actively social, especially with the anxiety that can come with autism or sensory children.</p><p>Sure, there are social media sites like Facebook, but they’re completely unsuitable for the majority of younger kids (let alone a child that also has an autistic spectrum disorder), they’re a war ground for bullying and negative behavior, product placement and a never-ending avalanche of advertisements and distractions.</p><p>The same is true of other online social apps. How can social networks that are continuously bombarding users with ads, promotions, trending topics from around the world and more be used by kids that already have difficulty dealing with the noise around them in daily life? </p><p>We know other parents that have children on the spectrum who have significant sensory issues, making it nearly impossible for them to even setup playdates because of the difficulties these type of social situations can create.</p><p>With the increase of more autism-friendly gaming groups and services, some of this has improved but there is still no easy to access social outlet for like-minded children to discuss their ideas and interests with each other, share projects they're working on and socially interact in a positive way.</p><p>Our families searched far and wide, but we couldn’t find anything out there that would meet the social needs of kids with autism.</p><p>This is when AutSocial was born.

We’ve built it this way to eliminate the distractions and anxiety that occur on mainstream social networks. There's no such thing as a “Trending Post”, no corporate ownership or funding from adverts or products.

At no time is any personal information ever stored about any of your children, ensuring that their privacy remains the highest priority. Apart from the screen name and age, no other information gets stored against the children’s logins you set up. With one parental account you can add up to four of your children.</p><p>We give parents the option of giving their kids the freedom to share messages any time, or for the parent to receive instant notifications to approve posts when your child makes them, and even allow or block the start of a chat or private message session between your child and other kids on the network. Your parental account lets you view an activity log of what your children are sharing and reading, shows any messages and posts that they have added, and even allows you to view chat content if you have concerns over who they’re interacting with. You can even opt to turn most functions on or off completely depending on the needs of your child.  The parental system gives you full control right in your pocket.</p><p>If someone requests your child as a friend on the network, you can even set whether you'd like to approve each request as it comes through yourself before your child sees it, or give them the control to accept friend requests themselves as they grow older.</p><p>This is all designed in an easy to set up options screen, so as your child gets older and you want to give them more freedom, you can remove the need for parental authorization on any and all activities.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Active Bullying Prevention </strong></p><p>One of the biggest problems facing social media today is bullying, and our platform has been built from the ground up in a way that promotes positive behaviour and can detect and alert parents at the very start of any situation that could lead to bullying behaviour. Whenever a child shares a message with someone else our AI monitors the text for specific keywords and language that can indicate bullying behaviour. An alert is then immediately sent to both parents who always have access to view the messages and shared posts between your child and other users on the network.</p><p>As a parent, you have the option to immediately block the other child permanently ensuring your child won’t see anything the blocked user has posted in the public groups or chat areas.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Kindness Rewarded</strong></p><p>A key difference with AutSocial is the concept of stars. The idea is when another child helps someone, or sends a message that is helpful, supportive and positive, or just does something pleasant for someone else on the network, the recipient is able to click the star button and it adds a star ranking to the user who was helpful. This helps to promote positive and collaborative behaviour, with stars being awarded based on positive activities. Negative behaviour, or negative posts can be blocked by the parent or child, and there’s no way to give a ""negative star rating"" (because this could be abused).</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579059798/yelz7endrl8puuk5rbfu.png"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Privacy is the most important thing</strong></p><p>When a parent signs up to the network there's a process to approve the login and identity to ensure your child’s safety online, and safeguard the network from intrusion by undesirable (or fake) users.</p><p>Over the next year we want to work with healthcare providers, community groups and specialist groups to set up a referral code system that will make this a quicker and more secure process.</p><p>AutSocial has special filters built into the system that can automatically detect when a child tries to share a mobile number, address or other personal information and block it.

In Parental View, you can see message and post activity from all your children, alerts or warnings if any bullying / issues have been detected, ask and answer questions from other parents, and set up or change passwords and settings for your children.</p><p>We will be posting curated content for parents that is visible in your parent feed. This includes helpful articles, links to resources for autism, information about local resources and events, and much more. Furthermore, you can easily turn off curated content in the parental settings.</p><p> </p><p><strong>The Future</strong></p><p>We want to continue to grow the system, and have a huge roadmap of features designed to make you and your children have the best experience online. This includes working with game hosts and designers, healthcare providers and professionals in the industry, and the Australian NDIS (and other overseas) health systems with an aim to make the subscription fee fully deductible.</p><p>Once we reach enough users on the platform for it to be self-sustaining and cover operational costs, we will be donating 60% of all profits toward Autism research and non for profit organisations to ensure we can make a difference even for those who aren't able to use AutSocial.</p><p>This is only a small snapshot of what we have planned and you can see more below in some of our stretch goals.</p><p> </p><p><strong>How AutSocial works and why we need your help</strong></p><p>One of the big differences we’ve been asked about is the subscription. A small subscription fee is needed to keep everything running, as we’ve decided to go down the road of not having corporate backing, and not including advertisements. We’ve aimed to make sure it’s accessible to everyone, even those who are struggling financially, so we’ve made it $5 AUD a month for parents ($3.50 USD) which lets you set up separate log ins for as many children as you have.</p><p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">As part of being a backer, every level of funding over $40 also includes at a minimum a full year of free access to the network.</span></p><p>We want to make sure that AutSocial remains a privately owned, community led, user-driven system that consistently aims to improve and offer new and exciting features designed to benefit parents, carers and children– which means running costs.</p><p>The funding we are raising will go toward the costs of programming the system, app developers to create our iPhone and Android editions, hosting of our servers, and to support the 6 months after we launch in may while we are still working with community groups and parents to build our user base and improve AutSocial as much as possible.</p><p>There are a lot of other features you can find listed below that we won't go into full detail on here, but we want to grow and improve AutSocial continuously with upcoming companion apps for Android and iPhone, and a huge amount of social features we have on our roadmap like group voice chat, professional educational resources and more to provide you with the best tools to help in your child's social development.</p><p>AutSocial has already made progress with some of the features we've talked about so far and a small group of parents and children giving feedback, but we are a long way from where we need to be. We’re not a big corporate company, not a Facebook or a software empire but two families with autistic children who want to help improve the lives of ASD kids everywhere, and with any endeavour like this, to get it where it needs to be we need some additional people and your help to fund it.</p><p><strong>We've just updated our campaign too - all donations over $30 will receive a year of full access to AutSocial for you and all children, any donation over $60 will receive two years.</strong></p><p><strong>Features in AutSocial / Goals :</strong></p><ul>

In Parental View, you can see message and post activity from all your children, alerts or warnings if any bullying / issues have been detected, ask and answer questions from other parents, and set up or change passwords and settings for your children.We will be posting curated content for parents that is visible in your parent feed. This includes helpful articles, links to resources for autism, information about local resources and events, and much more. Furthermore, you can easily turn off curated content in the parental settings. The FutureWe want to continue to grow the system, and have a huge roadmap of features designed to make you and your children have the best experience online. This includes working with game hosts and designers, healthcare providers and professionals in the industry, and the Australian NDIS (and other overseas) health systems with an aim to make the subscription fee fully deductible.Once we reach enough users on the platform for it to be self-sustaining and cover operational costs, we will be donating 60% of all profits toward Autism research and non for profit organisations to ensure we can make a difference even for those who aren't able to use AutSocial.This is only a small snapshot of what we have planned and you can see more below in some of our stretch goals. How AutSocial works and why we need your helpOne of the big differences we’ve been asked about is the subscription. A small subscription fee is needed to keep everything running, as we’ve decided to go down the road of not having corporate backing, and not including advertisements. We’ve aimed to make sure it’s accessible to everyone, even those who are struggling financially, so we’ve made it $5 AUD a month for parents ($3.50 USD) which lets you set up separate log ins for as many children as you have.As part of being a backer, every level of funding over $40 also includes at a minimum a full year of free access to the network.We want to make sure that AutSocial remains a privately owned, community led, user-driven system that consistently aims to improve and offer new and exciting features designed to benefit parents, carers and children– which means running costs.The funding we are raising will go toward the costs of programming the system, app developers to create our iPhone and Android editions, hosting of our servers, and to support the 6 months after we launch in may while we are still working with community groups and parents to build our user base and improve AutSocial as much as possible.There are a lot of other features you can find listed below that we won't go into full detail on here, but we want to grow and improve AutSocial continuously with upcoming companion apps for Android and iPhone, and a huge amount of social features we have on our roadmap like group voice chat, professional educational resources and more to provide you with the best tools to help in your child's social development.AutSocial has already made progress with some of the features we've talked about so far and a small group of parents and children giving feedback, but we are a long way from where we need to be. We’re not a big corporate company, not a Facebook or a software empire but two families with autistic children who want to help improve the lives of ASD kids everywhere, and with any endeavour like this, to get it where it needs to be we need some additional people and your help to fund it.We've just updated our campaign too - all donations over $30 will receive a year of full access to AutSocial for you and all children, any donation over $60 will receive two years.Features in AutSocial / Goals :
No personal data of your child is ever collected, at all. Your parental account stores your data for billing and identity verification, however this is stored in separate systems that are not connected to the social platform. This ensures your privacy, information, and the privacy of your children, is always 100% protected.
Ability to turn on low stimulation colour themes for children with sensory disorders.
Parents can set up screen time windows to set when and how long your child can use AutSocial each day, with the option to turn on or off a clock to show how much time is left and popup notifications that x minutes are left.
As a parent you can see a full timeline of what your child has posted, and their activity on AutSocial, with the ability to block other users.
Fully configure what features your child has access to and tailor the experience to their specific needs.
Language and Content Filters to help protect against inappropriate content and offensive language.
Automatic phrase detection alerts parents and blanks out mobile numbers, addresses and identifying information from any messages your child or other children share.
Full parental controls, you can be alerted to see and allow or disallow friend requests.
Bullying detection and notification to parents based on words and phrases in posts
The unique ‘star’ reward system to encourage helpful / positive behaviour.
‘Parents in my area’ feature for parent logins to find other parents in the area for social outings.
Topical groups for your child’s favourite interests such as artwork, sports, Minecraft, Roblox, artwork etc.
Parents can opt to approve posts your children make before they show up online.
The ability for parents to ask and answers questions anonymously of other parents in the parent portal.
We also are working with NDIS in Australia and other systems internationally to become recognized as NDIS accredited. (Though parents should already be able to claim membership fees immediately from NDIS in Australia when we launch)
Stretch Goals 1 [If we can raise more than $45,000]
Advanced A.I. and deep learning systems to help broaden your child’s interests, find likeminded children and suggest them dynamically.
Curated content –our team will regularly post about autism friendly games, information, and autism related articles for parents.
Topic based group chat with language filtering will let your children chat about their hobbies, games and interests with other likeminded kids. With full language filtering, and all chat is visible in real time to parents via the parents log in.
Additional keyword filters parents can set up in your parent portal can be used to filter certain types of information or posts from appearing in each individual child’s social feed.
Stretch Goals 2 [If we can raise more than $75,000]
Geolocation (parents-only - to find parents in your area, child logins and locations are never stored or shown).
In addition to the web based version, specific Android and iPhone app versions which use pop notifications to let parents know about activity or requests on AutSocial.
Login protected with Google authenticator for added security.
A.I. Image content filtering - image detection of faces etc. so you can be alerted and choose to allow/disallow if your child posts a photo.
A catalogue of local Autism related services near you with ratings from other parents.
Meetup in my area feature to help organize play dates and socialize with other parents of autistic children.
Regular curated content - books, videos, helpful information and resources for parents shown in the parents feed.
Connect and integrate with voice chat platforms like Discord, directly from the AutSocial message feed.
Educational videos and tutorials provided by community members and professionals.
We want to work with healthcare providers who can provide a special ‘signup’ code for the system to provide additional validation of parent identity to ensure your child’s safety.
After launch, once we have reached enough users on AutSocial to cover operational costs, we will also be donating 60% of profits each year toward Autism related charities and research organisations others to ensure we can make a difference even for those who aren't able to use AutSocial.We hope that you'll take this journey with us, and build a better online world for our kids and teens on the spectrum!",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Greg sat in his living room one evening eyeing several golf balls he recently retrieved from a box in the garage.

But as each ball brought back the memory of a peak golf experience, he realized they should not be lost in the garage. That sparked an idea.</h3>
<h3>A few months later, Greg met Kyle through a contact in the University of Colorado at Boulder Engineering School and together they spent several months in collaboration experimenting with a variety of computer models and material prototypes. They sought a highly functional yet elegant design compatible with a simple fabrication process. Wanting to minimize long-distance business relationships and keep manufacturing in the United States, Greg and Kyle avoided designs requiring injection molding. They eventually arrived at the GolfGalleryPro design as a beautiful solution to their set of constraints and priorities.</h3>

<li>Hello I am Johnny Lee Ruston, 54 years old and have dedicated most of my life to helping humanity. I have traveled all over the world, and no matter where I have been, I have seen so much pain and suffering, most of the time having one common factor, ""INFLAMMATION""<b>. </b>
</li>
<li>Our campaign is devoted to raising funds for mass production, marketing, and advertising of a remarkable topical cream, which I formulate, developed and have tested for 4 years. With an overall production of 57,000 test samples and not one side affect.  In fact it has been used in conjunction with so many numerous diseases and illnesses, that we have gained broad recognition from many Dr's, DO's MD's, DMD's and Surgeons whom have done their own studies. </li>
<li>Inflammation is a serious problem worldwide, and with your support we now have the ability to virtually end that pain and suffering.</li>
<li>When you choose to be a part of this campaign, we are jointly able to produce Valescere in mass quantities at the lowest possible cost bringing the product closer to more people.<br/>

Hello I am Johnny Lee Ruston, 54 years old and have dedicated most of my life to helping humanity. I have traveled all over the world, and no matter where I have been, I have seen so much pain and suffering, most of the time having one common factor, ""INFLAMMATION"". 

Our campaign is devoted to raising funds for mass production, marketing, and advertising of a remarkable topical cream, which I formulate, developed and have tested for 4 years. With an overall production of 57,000 test samples and not one side affect.  In fact it has been used in conjunction with so many numerous diseases and illnesses, that we have gained broad recognition from many Dr's, DO's MD's, DMD's and Surgeons whom have done their own studies. 
Inflammation is a serious problem worldwide, and with your support we now have the ability to virtually end that pain and suffering.
When you choose to be a part of this campaign, we are jointly able to produce Valescere in mass quantities at the lowest possible cost bringing the product closer to more people.

When he had his first doctor visit, he was spending three to four hours a day in the restroom, passing watery stools. The doctors did some blood work and found that he a few elevated liver enzymes. He underwent an ultrasound for Hepatitis and the test returned negative. The doctor also prescribed him some medication to stop his stomach spasms. The medication worked for a few days, then stopped working all together in addition to caused him severe cotton mouth and made it very difficult for him to reveal his bladder.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A few more weeks passed and the problem with Justen's stomach still persisted. He met with another doctor who was informed that the meds were not only, not working but causing problems too and Justen was told to discontinue the medication. He had stools tested for giardia and parasites and those also returned negative. Another three weeks passed and Justen tried to endure his situation the best he could, but upon hearing that Justen's stomach issues were getting worse, including stabbing pains in the gut, a dull ache in the chest and getting faint with little to no exertion, the church Justen was representing pulled him from his mission, citing his condition needed to be remedied.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Justen returned home and went through a battery of tests. He had CT scans on his abdomen, chest and pelvis. He had a full GI work up for celiacs, khrons, colitis and ulcerative colitis. He was tested for allergies too. All the tests returned negative. By this time Justen had been home nearly two months and lost 22lbs. He went from 150 lbs to 128 lbs. He met with a natreopathic doctor who did another stool test and she found that his immunity levels in his gut were very low. He was told the immunity levels take many months sometimes a few years to raise back to normal levels. He started to get a vitamin IV weekly from the doctor because his body was still turning everything he ate into waste. The recommendations of the natreopath after the vitamin IV did little good for Justen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By this time nearly a year had passed. Justen still did not have any answers. He was still spending 3-4 hours a day in the restroom, very thin and his body was severely atrophied. Despite Justen's difficult trial, he tried to remain positive and continued to deal with it smiling. Another year passed and on a few days before Thanksgiving in 2011 he was going to the restroom and vomitting at the same time, not keeping any food down whatsoever and getting dizzy just taking a few steps. An ambulance picked Justen up and he was admitted to the ER. He had a 103.4 fever, chills running up and down his body, could not get warm and was doing his best to stay with it. The doctors there were trying to prevent Justen from going into septic-shock (The 2nd leading cause of death in the ICU) The doctors succeeded and Justen was discharged four days later.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His blood tests showed low red blood cells, low potassium, low white blood cells and low lymphocytes. He was pointed towards a hematologist thinking to himself ""This is it, I'm going to finally find out what the heck is the matter with me."" Only to be disappointed and have the hematologist baffled that his blood work was now normal. By this time Justen was passing bright red and sometimes dark red clotted blood in his stools. A few months later Justen was trying to play doctor by himself, very frustrated with all of his medical experiences, so he bought some vitamins and special supplements. He started to gain some weight back which was miraculous in itself because had tried everything from a high calorie diet to protein shakes. Was it his immunity levels? He didn’t know. He was also able to start working out again. He had to start with 5lb dumb bells but within seven months he was lifting 27.5 dumb bells and two months after that he was lifting 32lb dumb bells. He also gained back the weight he lost. Things seemed to be finally turning around for Justen until a few months ago.</p>
<p><br/>His health has declined again. He has lost 10lbs in the last two months. He eats a lot and tries to exercise daily but it is not coming back like he hoped. He is also passing red blood and sometimes clotted dark red blood in his stools 3-4 times a week. He is also leaking blood through his underwear onto his jeans, which is not only alarming but embarrassing for Justen as well. His face is once again gaunt, his neck thin and his eyes sunken. Justen does not have medical insurance and cannot qualify for disability because he was never diagnosed. Work is also slow for Justen and he is not able to pay for the high quality diet his body was on a few months back or his gym membership or doctor visits. Justen can't get a job outside of the home because the mornings are the most difficult time for Justen's body, he is usually in the restroom the first hours of the morning and he does not know how he is going to feel one day to the next, or one hour to the next.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We need your help to get Justen back on his feet again. Back at the doctors even if he is only able to pay the very minimum on each bill, back to a healthy diet so his body is able to take in the nutrition it needs, some basic needs, and back to a good work out that starts with low intensity so he can work out the kinks and hopefully get his muscles to grow again. He thought his recovery was over but Justen isn't out of the woods yet. Thank you for listening to his story. And even if you can donate 1 dollar, it will help Justen a lot.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sincerely, Justen’s mother Diane</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you in advance for any assitance to Justen.</p>

Another year passed and on a few days before Thanksgiving in 2011 he was going to the restroom and vomitting at the same time, not keeping any food down whatsoever and getting dizzy just taking a few steps. An ambulance picked Justen up and he was admitted to the ER. He had a 103.4 fever, chills running up and down his body, could not get warm and was doing his best to stay with it. The doctors there were trying to prevent Justen from going into septic-shock (The 2nd leading cause of death in the ICU) The doctors succeeded and Justen was discharged four days later.
 
His blood tests showed low red blood cells, low potassium, low white blood cells and low lymphocytes. He was pointed towards a hematologist thinking to himself ""This is it, I'm going to finally find out what the heck is the matter with me."" Only to be disappointed and have the hematologist baffled that his blood work was now normal. By this time Justen was passing bright red and sometimes dark red clotted blood in his stools. A few months later Justen was trying to play doctor by himself, very frustrated with all of his medical experiences, so he bought some vitamins and special supplements. He started to gain some weight back which was miraculous in itself because had tried everything from a high calorie diet to protein shakes. Was it his immunity levels? He didn’t know. He was also able to start working out again. He had to start with 5lb dumb bells but within seven months he was lifting 27.5 dumb bells and two months after that he was lifting 32lb dumb bells. He also gained back the weight he lost. Things seemed to be finally turning around for Justen until a few months ago.
His health has declined again. He has lost 10lbs in the last two months. He eats a lot and tries to exercise daily but it is not coming back like he hoped. He is also passing red blood and sometimes clotted dark red blood in his stools 3-4 times a week. He is also leaking blood through his underwear onto his jeans, which is not only alarming but embarrassing for Justen as well. His face is once again gaunt, his neck thin and his eyes sunken. Justen does not have medical insurance and cannot qualify for disability because he was never diagnosed. Work is also slow for Justen and he is not able to pay for the high quality diet his body was on a few months back or his gym membership or doctor visits. Justen can't get a job outside of the home because the mornings are the most difficult time for Justen's body, he is usually in the restroom the first hours of the morning and he does not know how he is going to feel one day to the next, or one hour to the next.
 
We need your help to get Justen back on his feet again. Back at the doctors even if he is only able to pay the very minimum on each bill, back to a healthy diet so his body is able to take in the nutrition it needs, some basic needs, and back to a good work out that starts with low intensity so he can work out the kinks and hopefully get his muscles to grow again. He thought his recovery was over but Justen isn't out of the woods yet. Thank you for listening to his story. And even if you can donate 1 dollar, it will help Justen a lot.
 
Sincerely, Justen’s mother Diane
 
Thank you in advance for any assitance to Justen.

</div><p></p><h3><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A bit about us </span></h3><p></p>
<p>We are a team
that believes that every person who needs an artificial limb should have access
not only to the prosthesis, but also to recover autonomy and use of this
extremity at the lowest cost. We’re doing this with the help of a team conformed
by a PhD physician, myself, a friend of mine, who just graduated from
Mechatronics too and a brain signal specialist with a PhD. </p>
<p>Our first
model is patent pending, which allowed us to obtain government funds to
continue with our R&amp;D, but only to certain extent. Part of the funds are
also allocated to the patenting process, and because of this, I can't upload a picture of the prototype. Further funds are needed to patent the
hand in the USA and Europe (France, Spain, England and some others). </p>
<p>The
prosthetic hand works thanks to 12 DC motors, controlled by a micro-controller
from Texas Instruments. Each motor has a PI-controller and it is connected to a
driver, also from TI. The development of the board costs $ 20,000 USD, so a
good amount of the founding is going to be used for this purpose. We already
bought the DC motors and their drivers and the encoders for the control. </p>
<p></p><h3>About the project</h3><div>I'm a Mechatronics Engineer studying at the Tecnológico de Monterrey, campus Guadalajara, Mexico. I'm currently in my 8th semester and I decided, some months ago, to start a prosthetic hand business to help people in Mexico (working sector) and later, once we grow, enter the USA, Europe, Colombia markets, among other ones. This project was born from the moment I saw Star Wars, which is why I decided to study the major I'm studying. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">When I saw the movie, I told myself ""Mike, you are doing it"" referring to Anakin arm. I didn't start the project before because of knowledge and the school, but last semester, the opportunity to start it arrived and I decided it was about time to start so I started to work on the model, model which I have tested extensibly to ensure a good functioning.  </span>
</div><div>
<p>With your help, we will be able to develop the board for the MCU, the brain of the hand, protect the idea in more countries, even protect the design of the hand, make the silicon glove, which gives the hand a natural appearance and will make the hand to fully function, even use the keyboard, play the piano, and, why not, even play the guitar. It will be possible to realize this thanks to you. Every person who support this project will have a special place on our website. And thanks to your help we will be able to help people who need this more. The reason we are doing this, is not for the money, is for helping people to recover their autonomy. </p>
<p>We already have an algorithm to receive the signal and process it and move every finger on an independent way, giving the user a complete control of the hand!! </p>

<div>We need $ 50,000 USD for this project, on this stage. </div>
<ul>
<li>At least $ 15,000 USD are going to protecting the product, to patent it. </li>
<li>We need $ 18,000 USD for the developing of the board, the brain of the hand, the brain that will allow the user to recover the life before the accident.</li>
<li>Approximately $ 2,000 USD  for the 3D printing, using strong and light material so the hand lasts many years and support high temperatures and the heavy use. </li>

</ul>
<div>Every person who donates will have a special reward, and all of you will be mentioned, if we get your permission, of course, on our website. You can see the different rewards but I'm gonna let you in on a secret here for you: our biggest supporter will have a four days stay in Guadalajara, Mexico and a special meeting with the team and the first patient who receives the hand.</div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<div>Our goal is to create the best prosthetic hand in the market, that can be affordable for the people who need it more and that be entirely controllable by the user. Imagine to be one of the first who believed in us in the future, when we, thanks to your help, will be able to give a man or a woman the prosthesis they need so badly. Imagine the happiness of this person to finally recover their autonomy.</div>
<div>The project is 100% possible, you can see the page <a href=""http://www.touchbionics.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.touchbionics.com</a> company that makes prosthetic hands too, or here in Mexico <a href=""http://www.probionics.com.mx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.probionics.com.mx</a>. The last one is in spanish but they are making a prosthetic claw and have succeed. and our goal is to overcome them, all this, thanks to your help!!</div>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Challenges</span><br/></p>
<div>The most difficult part on this project is to ensure the user the independency of each finger, as the ability to use the keypad again and of course, write. Also, the natural movements are not going to be easy, but we have <span style=""background-color: initial;"">worked very hard to make them possible. </span>
</div>
<div>
<p></p>
<p>We have more than 100 patients waiting for us, just here, in Guadalajara. </p>
<p>We have planned to start with five of them, with prototypes, to ensure the correct functioning and verify the details we could have missed. Once we are sure it is a good product, we will start implementing the prosthesis on each and all of them, if possible, so they can be able to be autonomous again. </p>
<p>Our most difficult goal is to make it cheap. The idea is to make a low-medium cost prosthetic hand, because here in Mexico, (I cannot talk about other parts of the world yet) the people who most need this device is the working sector, sector that can't pay a lot of money because they don't have plenty resources. The plan is to sell it on less than $ 15,000 USD, so it can be more accesible to the people who need this more. </p>

<h3>Other ways to help</h3>
<div>If you currently can't afford to donate some dollars but you are interested on the project and believe in us, you can always refer the project to more people so we can continue to work on this project and I personally ask you to tell them they came here thanks to you, so you can get an award too. </div>
<div>
<h3>Rewards</h3>Every one of our supporters will get an appreciation letter signed by the team, unless you don't want it. And, as I said before, if we have your consent, you will be on the website as one of our benefactors. Also, if you are in the need of a prosthetic hand you will get a very good discount when we start selling them.</div>
<div>If your donation is between our rewards, don't worry!! Please leave you email so we can send you a reward too!! We cannot cover all the options. Everyone has to and will get a reward!! Why? Because we are 100% committed to you and with the project and I believe that everyone who believe in us, need a recognition, because this project, helping people, will be thanks to you!!</div>

<p><strong style=""line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">Activation and Subscription Fees</strong><br/></p>
<p>Using satellites orbiting the earth and GSM networks to keep track of your Retrievor is an expensive business, which means there is a $5.79 monthly subscription fee for your first Retrievor. This is charged annually in advance. Additional Retrievor's can be added to your subscription plan for only $4.59 extra per month. Some good news though - As a token of our appreciation, there is NO Activation Fee for Indiegogo contributors!</p>
<p><b>GSM Coverage</b></p>
<p>Retrievor will function almost anywhere in the world using GSM networks and autonomous GPS for tracking. We have incorporated (A)ssisted GPS to improve spatial resolution (accuracy) through cell triangulation and to improve App functionality. </p>

<b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</b><p></p>
<p>In a nutshell, we need your help through pre-orders to get the required funding to commercialize our venture and put Retrievor into large scale production. This is also an exercise to assess demand for our innovative product and at the same time helps us build a strong relationship with our early adopters. </p>
<p>With your help, we need to: <span style=""background-color: initial;"">.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Place our first production orders (we are working with a manufacturing company with lot's of GPS hardware experience, but ultimately, we need to know how many Retrievor's to make!)</span></li>
<li>We also need funding to further our App development and back-end technology and support.</li>
<li>Futher develop our proprietary power source (in parallel with the above).</li>
</ul>
<p>And if you’re international, we want to help you out too. With the exception of the USA, Canada and the European Union (EU), we still have a lot to figure out in regards to regulations in other specific countries. We'll get there eventually, after all, GPS technology is already available in almost all of them so it's really just a case of getting the correct paperwork in order!</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Risks and challenges</b></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">As with any product, supply chain logistics can potentially impact parts delivery. Additionally, delays may result from final detailing and testing lab procedures and certifications.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>The Road Ahead</strong></p>
<p>At this point in our venture we have already selected technology and manufacturing partners and the hardware design is secured. This design needs tweaking and is an ongoing process during the development and refinement of our product.</p>

<h4><b><i>FAQ</i></b></h4>
<p><b>What happens if you don't reach you funding goal.</b></p>
<p>We are asking for your help to assist us (through pre-orders) in financing  the manufacture of Retrievor in sufficient quantity. As we have already reached our funding goal and utilized the funds for development thus far, we still need more funding to enable us to manufacture and further develop our product. </p>
<p><b>How long will the battery last?</b></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We are developing our very own propriety power source. Battery level is </span>dependent<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> on usage and the rate at which you want to track the device. User defined ping rates can be adjusted from every second through to once per day so Retrievor may never need a recharge for a whole year!</span></p>
<p><b>Will I have to sign up for a carrier subscription?</b></p>
<p>We are using AT&amp;T for data so that Retrievor will function almost anywhere in the world using both GSM networks and autonomous GPS for tracking.  There is a subscription charge of $5.89 per month.</p>
<p><b>Will there be additional costs?</b></p>
<p>There will be  a small monthly fee of $5.89 per month per device. In effect, we are guaranteeing the subscription price at $5.89 per device for the 1st year for all of our Indiegogo pre-order customers.</p>
<p><b>How accurate is Retrievor?</b></p>
<p>Accurate within 3- 7 feet (1 - 2 meters)</p>
<p><b>Do you ship internationally?</b></p>
<p>Yes, besides USA we will ship Worldwide.</p>
<p><b>What languages will the App be available in?</b></p>
<p>During the first year we will release the App. in the following languages English, German, French, Dutch, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish, Spanish and Italian.</p>
<p><b>Can I travel with Retrievor?</b></p>
<p>Yes, without additional cost or any changes, Retrievor can be used all over the world! Tracking is not solely dependent on GSM network access as our device uses traditional GPS too.</p>
<p><b>How can Retrievor be so small?</b></p>
<p>With the help of smart technology and the inclusion of Solar and a propriety charging solution, Retrievor can efficiently manage the battery consumption, which means that we can use a very small power source. Retrievor is also packed with the latest components that are all very small in size and can also switch to sleep mode when not in use.</p>
<p><b>How do I connect with Retrievor through my SmartPhone?</b></p>
<p>In the box there will be a code for the App and our hosted web mapping service. After downloading the App from AppStore or Google Play you enter the code and right away you are connected and can start tracking Retrievor.</p>
<p><b>Will it be possible to remote control the polling frequency ?</b><br/></p>
<p>The polling frequency can be adjusted remotely by the user by logging into our server based application platform. Polling can be set at anything from every second through to once per day or the device can be set in 'sleep' mode for extended periods.</p>
<p><b>What are GPS and Glonass?</b></p>
<p>GPS is a satellite system created by the US military but is today mostly used for civilian purposes. Glonass is the Russian version that has better reach in many locations. To be able to offer both will give superior coverage.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>How can I attach Retrievor to my child or pet?</b></p>
<p>In the box you will find a multipurpose clip that makes it possible to attach Retrievor anywhere and there will also be a specially designed collar clip for pet collars.</p>
<p><b>Can I become a distributor/dealer/reseller/retailer or partner?</b></p>
<p>At the moment we are focusing our efforts on our first manufacturing run and QA but do have small retailer/reseller bundles available here on our campaign page. We will be discussing possible distribution/retailer/partnerships during Q1 2014. Please contact us through this link <a href=""http://www.retrievor.com/contact-us"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.retrievor.com/contact-us</a> showing your interest and we will contact you once our first manufacturing run is complete and dispatched.<br/></p>
<p><b>How do I charge my Retrievor?</b></p>
<p>Retrievor is self-charging through the use of Solar and Kinetic motion. For times when your device is stationary and in an environment of low light for long periods, a micro USB cable is included in the box. Attach it to Retrievor and then you can charge it via your computer or by using the adapter that came with your SmartPhone. You can also use any standard USB A cigarette lighter adapter to charge Retrievor if needed (using the USB A - MIcro B cable which is included with your device) These chargers are freely available in most stores. </p>

You can chose your own icon from a standard menu for each RETRIEVOR device you want to track or even upload your very own. By clicking on the icon in ""Radar"" mode, you are automatically taken to the ""Map"" screen, displaying the exact location of Retrievor, route taken, speed, and distance traveled. With all this information, there's little chance anything will be missing in action for too long!

Multi-Retrievor Support!
Want to keep track of your daughter and son's cars or two family pets at the same time? No problem! Upon activation, you can track and retrieve several devices on one mapping screen.

Multi-Purpose Attachment Clip
Your free little attachment clip allows you to attach your Retrievor to just about anything, including pet collars. 



Activation and Subscription Fees
Using satellites orbiting the earth and GSM networks to keep track of your Retrievor is an expensive business, which means there is a $5.79 monthly subscription fee for your first Retrievor. This is charged annually in advance. Additional Retrievor's can be added to your subscription plan for only $4.59 extra per month. Some good news though - As a token of our appreciation, there is NO Activation Fee for Indiegogo contributors!
GSM Coverage
Retrievor will function almost anywhere in the world using GSM networks and autonomous GPS for tracking. We have incorporated (A)ssisted GPS to improve spatial resolution (accuracy) through cell triangulation and to improve App functionality. 



What We Need & What You Get
In a nutshell, we need your help through pre-orders to get the required funding to commercialize our venture and put Retrievor into large scale production. This is also an exercise to assess demand for our innovative product and at the same time helps us build a strong relationship with our early adopters. 
With your help, we need to: .

Place our first production orders (we are working with a manufacturing company with lot's of GPS hardware experience, but ultimately, we need to know how many Retrievor's to make!)
We also need funding to further our App development and back-end technology and support.
Futher develop our proprietary power source (in parallel with the above).

And if you’re international, we want to help you out too. With the exception of the USA, Canada and the European Union (EU), we still have a lot to figure out in regards to regulations in other specific countries. We'll get there eventually, after all, GPS technology is already available in almost all of them so it's really just a case of getting the correct paperwork in order!

Risks and challenges
As with any product, supply chain logistics can potentially impact parts delivery. Additionally, delays may result from final detailing and testing lab procedures and certifications.

The Road Ahead
At this point in our venture we have already selected technology and manufacturing partners and the hardware design is secured. This design needs tweaking and is an ongoing process during the development and refinement of our product.








FAQ
What happens if you don't reach you funding goal.
We are asking for your help to assist us (through pre-orders) in financing  the manufacture of Retrievor in sufficient quantity. As we have already reached our funding goal and utilized the funds for development thus far, we still need more funding to enable us to manufacture and further develop our product. 
How long will the battery last?
We are developing our very own propriety power source. Battery level is dependent on usage and the rate at which you want to track the device. User defined ping rates can be adjusted from every second through to once per day so Retrievor may never need a recharge for a whole year!
Will I have to sign up for a carrier subscription?
We are using AT&T for data so that Retrievor will function almost anywhere in the world using both GSM networks and autonomous GPS for tracking.  There is a subscription charge of $5.89 per month.
Will there be additional costs?
There will be  a small monthly fee of $5.89 per month per device. In effect, we are guaranteeing the subscription price at $5.89 per device for the 1st year for all of our Indiegogo pre-order customers.
How accurate is Retrievor?
Accurate within 3- 7 feet (1 - 2 meters)
Do you ship internationally?
Yes, besides USA we will ship Worldwide.
What languages will the App be available in?
During the first year we will release the App. in the following languages English, German, French, Dutch, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish, Spanish and Italian.
Can I travel with Retrievor?
Yes, without additional cost or any changes, Retrievor can be used all over the world! Tracking is not solely dependent on GSM network access as our device uses traditional GPS too.
How can Retrievor be so small?
With the help of smart technology and the inclusion of Solar and a propriety charging solution, Retrievor can efficiently manage the battery consumption, which means that we can use a very small power source. Retrievor is also packed with the latest components that are all very small in size and can also switch to sleep mode when not in use.
How do I connect with Retrievor through my SmartPhone?
In the box there will be a code for the App and our hosted web mapping service. After downloading the App from AppStore or Google Play you enter the code and right away you are connected and can start tracking Retrievor.
Will it be possible to remote control the polling frequency ?
The polling frequency can be adjusted remotely by the user by logging into our server based application platform. Polling can be set at anything from every second through to once per day or the device can be set in 'sleep' mode for extended periods.
What are GPS and Glonass?
GPS is a satellite system created by the US military but is today mostly used for civilian purposes. Glonass is the Russian version that has better reach in many locations. To be able to offer both will give superior coverage.

How can I attach Retrievor to my child or pet?
In the box you will find a multipurpose clip that makes it possible to attach Retrievor anywhere and there will also be a specially designed collar clip for pet collars.
Can I become a distributor/dealer/reseller/retailer or partner?
At the moment we are focusing our efforts on our first manufacturing run and QA but do have small retailer/reseller bundles available here on our campaign page. We will be discussing possible distribution/retailer/partnerships during Q1 2014. Please contact us through this link http://www.retrievor.com/contact-us showing your interest and we will contact you once our first manufacturing run is complete and dispatched.
How do I charge my Retrievor?
Retrievor is self-charging through the use of Solar and Kinetic motion. For times when your device is stationary and in an environment of low light for long periods, a micro USB cable is included in the box. Attach it to Retrievor and then you can charge it via your computer or by using the adapter that came with your SmartPhone. You can also use any standard USB A cigarette lighter adapter to charge Retrievor if needed (using the USB A - MIcro B cable which is included with your device) These chargers are freely available in most stores. 

                                         
Grab Yourself a TFor those who want to support us without actually pre-ordering a device, we have a special T-Shirt for you to show our appreciation. Just contribute $25 and one will be on it's way to you for Christmas.

This causes: 
hot flashes, night sweating, restlessness, headaches
continuous tossing and turning, insomnia or disturbed sleep (freq. waking up) 
  #Solution: Keep Calm & Sleep Cool; So you can sleep with No Disruptions.    The Dullo Plus Pillow features our premium cotton pillow cover, a pocket for interchangeable pillow inserts- cotton pillow insert & cooling pillow insert. Once you use its 8-hour cooling packs, Dullo Plus prevents Night Sweating and Overheating. This cooling sensation helps you relax and sleep more deeply while relieving stress & tension of the entire body. Once you use a cotton pillow insert or utilize the edges/sides, Dullo Plus becomes the most ergonomic pillow, ever, so you can snore less and sleep more.  All the environmental factors in the bedroom play a big role. Room temperature & body temperature must be in sync, and usually, our heads get heat up due to overheating cotton pillows or memory foam pillows. We can fix that in 3 ways: 1. Cooling Pillow Insert with Ice PacksThe Cooling Pillow Insert holds 3-cooling packs that extend the cooling up to 7-8 hours of refreshing coolness while you sleep. When you wake up you can remove the cooling packs and place them in your freezer so you’ll be ready for another great night of sleep.    Dullo Plus’s Cooling Pillow Insert radiates refreshing cool air all around your shoulders, neck, and head while you sleep. The cooling packs, themselves, disperse body heat. If you want the extra chill, just put it in the freezer for continuous cooling relief.The Cooling Pillow Insert uses a water-tight pouch so you won’t have to worry about any leaks or wetness.  ""Experience The Next-Level Cooling Comfort in Dullo Plus!"" 2. No Frosts (never wetting your pillow)  No Frosts with Hexa Layered Structure: Tested in many field tests, we figured out a way to hold icepacks inside the pillow without frosts, so absolutely nothing gets wet.   8 Hours of Cooling, Not Freezing: No one gets freezing cold. It's  provides  cooling comfort. The icepack insert (packet) holds 3 icepacks with 6 layers of fabrics (as seen in the picture below), providing superior insulation.  3. Optimal Air Flow: Cooling Comfort Pillow Cover: 100% Premium Cotton that provides extreme ventilation, compared to polyester and bamboo covers. A breathable cotton cover helps circulate the airway from your body- keeping you comfortably cool.    Microfiber Fillers: We meticulously use short and thin fibers only. They are highly water-resistant and breathable, allowing Dullo Plus Pillow to control humidity & temperature throughout the night.  Dullo Plus is also a Neck Relief Pillow for Back, Side, & Tummy Sleepers. Our purpose is to guide you into sleep in the most natural way possible... in a good posture.   1. For Side Sleepers The Arch Side helps side sleepers maintain horizontal spinal alignment as they sleep. Traditional pillows create a space between the pillow and your neck. The Dullo+ perfectly moulds to your neck giving you the complete support you need to sleep comfortably.  2. For Back Sleepers   The Crown Side provides back sleepers the best sleep possible by gently supporting their necks so they can maintain their spine’s natural c-curve. Other pillows allow for too much movement during the night which causes you to lose sleep. The center of the Dullo+ cradles your head from all angles so you can sleep in a comfortable position all night. Tip: the dimple in the middle can be used for side-sleepers as ear hole :)   If you need more adjustability to already great ergonomics of the Dullo Plus Pillow,  a cotton pillow insert can be used. This boosts the pillow by a few inches to fit your neck curve perfectly.  One Simple Goal: Adjust Pillow Height for Ultimate Neck Relief - Amazing Touch & Feel    Machine Washable - Keep Your Pillows Clean at All TimesThe best way to keep your pillow clean is to wash it. Pillows that are only cover-washable end up accumulating months or even years worth of sweat, dust, and bacteria. Cotton Shower Pillow is washable in its entirety so that you can always keep it sanitized and fresh. Just toss it in the washer and dryer- quick, breezy, fluffy. Dullo Plus’s silicone-coated microfibers hold their shape because they are elastic and resilient. They absorb micro shocks from your neck and shoulders so you can sleep more comfortably. Its microfiber filler can be removed or added to get the perfect height.  Thin & Short microfiber: won't get clumpy, while providing superior support Silicone Coated fibers: repel water so they won’t clump together.     The Cotton Shower team has planned, developed, and shipped 4 different types of pillows over the last 4-years. Each pillow has taught us more about how people sleep, how they want t sleep better, and how we can improve our pillows to make your sleep more enjoyable.Each version has unique design improvements that provide sleepers with additional benefits that help them fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer.Our current pillow, the Dullo Plus, is our most advanced pillow to-date while it provides cooling comfort and neck relief at the same time.

uncommon type of GastroIntestinal Cancer that occurs along the GI tract. 
Up until this past April they have attempted a couple of surgeries as well as
various types of treatment in order to slow (there is no cure) the growth of
the tumors.  In April Richard was in serious pain and after some tests and
scans it was discovered that the medication they were using was not working the
medical team then went to work to see what else they could do for
Richard.  Recently, Richard was informed that there was a new drug that
the team wanted to try as well as a major surgery sometime in April 2015. 
If the drug appeared to be holding or shrinking the tumors then he would
continue with the drug after the surgery, either way though this is all in an
effort to give Richard more time.  </p>
<p>On January 10<sup>th</sup>, after only a couple of days of
being on the new drug, Richard’s body began to shut down as it rejected the
medication.  Saturday Jan 10<sup>th</sup> and Sunday Jan 11<sup>th</sup>
brought forth a lot of confusion and fear.  Richard was completely
disoriented and did not know what was going on and panic seemed to set in when
he announced that he could no longer see.  Richard was eventually moved to
the ICU at Ottawa’s General Hospital where he eventually fell into a deep sleep
and couldn’t be woken up.  On Tuesday he started to wake and began to
respond with yes or nodding.  Pupils were dilating and so it appeared his
vision was returning somewhat.  On Wednesday when Sylvie (Richard’s wife)
entered the room Richard said “Good Morning Sylvie”, his sight was back. 
Though still very weak and with his mind a little numb (his words) he was able
to have conversations and eat.  Over the next few days Richard’s status
improved and he now appears to be back to where he was before he started with
the new medication.</p>
Richard
is now slated for an 18-20hr surgery on January 30<sup>th</sup> where the
surgical team will remove all they can.  If the surgery is successful,
Richard will get more time, how much is not known.  Richard has been on
disability since April and it has come to my attention that because of his
medical situation he was not able to get life insurance on his mortgage.

Knowledge is power and Sippo was designed to make it to know your optimal hydration levels and implement an actionable plan to get there.









Your hydration requirements changes daily based on your activity and your environmental conditions and Sippo gives you the knowledge to know your current Hydration Status, and more importantly, how we can reach your optimal hydration levels throughout the day.



The Sippo smartphone app gives you real-time knowledge and updates to let you know where you are, and how far away you are from your daily goal.









Throughout your day, Sippo will deliver knowledge and intelligence to you through your smartphone (smartwatch, tablet or computer will be available with feature releases) to let you know it is time to take a sip.

Just a heads up, the same time you take a sip today, may not be the same time tomorrow…

With the help and support of Sippo, you will never come home from work tired, fatigued and dehydrated. Sippo will create a more energized you!







Review your daily, monthly and long-term hydration logs to see where you are doing well, how you can do better and how your hydration levels affect your overall health.






With Sippo’s Smart App Analytics tools, you can integrate your hydration results with data from other sources to see a bigger picture. Sippo is a vital missing link that other health devices do not track.












Sippo provideds you with the knowledge of what is right for you, not the average human being.



By analyzing your weight, activity, and environment, Sippo provides custom recommendations tailored to you, not the average person.









When you are not properly hydrated, you feel a burning sensation in your stomach that is similar to hunger pangs. This feeling can mistakenly lead you to unnecessary calorie consumption.  






Research shows that drinking one 8oz glass of water eliminates the false hunger sensation in 98% of subjects. Further, a 16oz glass of water will cause your metabolism to increase by 30%.



With Sippo, you know throughout your day you will be properly hydrated, helping you reach your weight goals naturally.









Whether you back your data up to the Sippo App or to your operating systems health kit, you know your health vitals are safe.
This feature will be available in February 2016.








 
By integrating your Sippo hydration logs with other wearables you may currently be using, your overall health picture is now much more complete with an added key component that no wearable is able to compute.



Sippo will seamlessly integrate with Google Fit and Apple Healthkit API’s to share valuable data for a comprehensive health overview, in one central location so you see the full picture of how each influence each other (stretch goal).

that empowers children to take control of their health destinies. <i>Healthy Food for Life</i>, our

the foundation for lifelong well-being. </p>
<p>This dynamic program uses interactive games, food demonstrations and learning tools to engage students from pre-K through middle school. Over the course of the six-week program, students gain priceless
information and resources to help them lead the healthiest lives possible.  A powerful ripple effect then takes place as
the students share their excitement and newfound knowledge with their families. Wellness Foundation knows that reaching children is not enough and that is why we invite parents and families to attend all of our classes. By involving parents, we are empowering the whole family!</p>
<p>When visitors see our <i>Healthy

are shooting their hands up to answer questions, racing to taste the food that
has been prepared, and eagerly becoming 'food detectives' on a quest to find

Delani’s mom, Faith, stopped at McDonalds to get dinner. She was shocked when
her four year old said, “Mommy, I don’t want to eat here. They don’t have any
whole food here, just junk food that is bad for my body.”  Faith was shocked and wanted to know more
about what Delani was learning in <i>Healthy

<p>Faith was so inspired by what she learned that she
immediately signed up for the adult Wellness Challenge. She then called her
parents, who were visiting Florida at the time, and told them they had to sign
up, too! Faith credits Delani for getting her on the path to wellness. She said
“When my four year old came home with recipes begging me to buy spinach and
fruit for smoothies, I knew I had to do it.” 
Faith and her parents, Vivienne and Earl, all worked hard during the
Wellness Challenge and enjoyed significant results. They all experienced
improvements in their weight, cholesterol and energy levels and achieved a

I was a typical child; cheerful, friendly, and passionate about drawing and literature. I was a child like all other children, yet different. As I grew, instead of developing straight, my spine began to curve into an S shape (the image above, on the right is a 3D MRI of my back taken 2 weeks ago). My parents were very proactive and took me to different doctors. Some said I needed surgery. Others said I must go swimming daily and to a spa to receive regular massages. At that time, we were very poor and my parents didn't have money for regular massages and swimming. Furthermore, the idea of financing surgery was unthinkable. </p><p>Despite these financial difficulties, my parents were able to save what they could and I had the opportunity to do the minimum: swimming and massage, twice a year. Unfortunately, my scoliosis did not improve. As the years have passed, I’ve grown up with breathing difficulties, getting colds easily, and tiring quickly. My only relief has come from very strong pain relieving medication.</p><p>My scoliosis is now grade 4; a very pronounced S curve. If I could swim every day, get a massage every three months and exercise, I would feel better, but the pain in my back would not dissipate and my breathing problems would persist. In addition to my physical pain, I am always trying to hide this problem from others. </p><p>Many times, I remember when I was younger, my father said, “How good would it be if Jesus lived here on Earth? He would put his hands on your back and heal you.” Hearing this, I would wonder, ‘Why isn’t Jesus with us now?’! I needed 13 years to understand that Jesus is always with us. He is at work and works through people.  </p><p>Now, at the age of 23, spinal surgery before the age of 25 is my last chance at a better life and I don’t want to miss this opportunity. Not having the surgery means I am at risk for a rapid decline in my health related to intense pain and difficulty breathing. In my present condition, I’ve been told to expect a 30% lung capacity reduction in my future as a result of getting a small cold.</p><p>The procedure that I require is one that is performed in many developed European countries. Germany is where my family and I have chosen to travel to find a qualified doctor who will perform the surgery that will immensely improve my quality of life now and for the future. </p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p>My family has very
little money and the surgery costs 60.000 €.<span>This is a very large sum and I am trying to raise this through multiple
methods, which include: here on indiegogo, I’ve proposed 2000 dollars. If this is successful, I will launch another campaign at a later date. At the same time, I am
contacting friends, family, NGOs, companies, etc with letters to explain my
story. </span></p><p><span>Please, help me on this first step towards a life without scoliosis with </span>whatever amount

Unfortunately, my scoliosis did not improve. As the years have passed, I’ve grown up with breathing difficulties, getting colds easily, and tiring quickly. My only relief has come from very strong pain relieving medication.My scoliosis is now grade 4; a very pronounced S curve. If I could swim every day, get a massage every three months and exercise, I would feel better, but the pain in my back would not dissipate and my breathing problems would persist. In addition to my physical pain, I am always trying to hide this problem from others. Many times, I remember when I was younger, my father said, “How good would it be if Jesus lived here on Earth? He would put his hands on your back and heal you.” Hearing this, I would wonder, ‘Why isn’t Jesus with us now?’! I needed 13 years to understand that Jesus is always with us. He is at work and works through people.  Now, at the age of 23, spinal surgery before the age of 25 is my last chance at a better life and I don’t want to miss this opportunity. Not having the surgery means I am at risk for a rapid decline in my health related to intense pain and difficulty breathing. In my present condition, I’ve been told to expect a 30% lung capacity reduction in my future as a result of getting a small cold.The procedure that I require is one that is performed in many developed European countries. Germany is where my family and I have chosen to travel to find a qualified doctor who will perform the surgery that will immensely improve my quality of life now and for the future. My family has very
little money and the surgery costs 60.000 €.This is a very large sum and I am trying to raise this through multiple
methods, which include: here on indiegogo, I’ve proposed 2000 dollars. If this is successful, I will launch another campaign at a later date. At the same time, I am
contacting friends, family, NGOs, companies, etc with letters to explain my
story. Please, help me on this first step towards a life without scoliosis with whatever amount
you are able to donate today. Also, share my story with your friends and family. If you have any questions, please contact me directly with the subject line: Indiegogo Scoliosis at elena.gherta2@gmail.com . Respectfully,Elena Gherta",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We are three final year medical students – Marnie, Sasha and Adam – doing our medical elective for six week in a rural pediatric hospital in Northern India this October.</p>
<p>I, Marnie, have done a volunteer placement in this hospital in 2007. It is a hospital of about 50 beds that was established in 1991 and is owned and run by one of the best paediatricians in the city, Dr. Rajan Kalra.</p>
<p>From my previous experience in Kalra Hospital, I remember that it is bursting with patients and has very basic facilities. It is not government funded (like majority of the hospitals in India) and the patient population are very poor and often cannot afford the $2 consultation fee or $15 admission fee required.</p>
<p>The hospital system in India is markedly different to that of the Western World. The most common medical conditions resulting in hospital admission are malaria, hepatitis, fever, diarrhoea, typhoid, meningitis and cholera. Most of these are preventable. The cultural approach to health and illness, the ratio of doctors to patients, the waiting time, the lack of resources and medications and the variety of serious yet preventable illnesses prevalent were all astonishing to me. However, the single most unsettling difference I noticed was the poor hygiene.</p>
<p>There were no gloves, no hand sanitiser, no soap, no alcohol swabs and no chlorhexidine. Wounds were not cleaned with sterile instruments and there were no protective caps on temperature probes.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Our main goal is to improve sanitation and hygiene at the hospital. Improved sanitation in developing countries typically yields about US$9 for every US$1 spent. Our aim is to provide gloves, hand sanitizer, soap, safe boxes for sharps disposals, detergent, washing powder for linen, cleaning products for beds/floor, and any other helpful agent to promote good sanitation and hygiene thus reducing the burden of preventable disease.</p>
<p>We are well aware that no amount of funding can help maintain hygiene in a medical setting without education. We will therefore be running educational sessions for all staff members at the hospital in the hope to implement long-term change.</p>
<p>We aim to set up a continuous fund to allow for the constant availability of these simple materials to increase hygiene but for now require a strong start-up donation.</p>
<p>Additionally, everyday there are hundreds of children requiring medical care that cannot afford treatment. We therefore also intend to use this money to assist these children’s families in paying for admission to hospital, antibiotics and other medications and in any other way we deem necessary.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Why is hygiene important? On the simplest level, it prevents or minimises initial disease and/or the spreading of disease. Research shows that, if widely practiced, something as EASY as <strong>hand washing with soap</strong> could reduce diarrhea by almost fifty percent and respiratory infections by nearly twenty-five percent. Hand washing with soap also reduces the incidence of skin diseases, eye infections like trachoma and intestinal worms.</p>

<h1>IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO ALL BACKERS:</h1>
<p> </p>
<p>Dear Qurelife backers,</p>
<p>First of all, we sincerely apologize for the fact that there has been no communication with you recently about the progress of the project. That is not the way it supposed to be.</p>
<p><strong>We offer a full refund to all dissatisfied backers.</strong></p>
<p>Qurelife is not a ""scam"" but it has almost gone bankrupt in recent months, because committed investment has failed to materialize and deliveries to America proved difficult to realize. This was partly due to Corona, but also due to export regulations.</p>
<p>Backers from Europe who do not opt ​​for a refund can still receive the Qurelife suitcase, but this can still take a few months. We make no promise about the exact date because we do not know it yet.</p>
<p><strong>We advise backers outside Europe to request a refund, as we expect deliveries to take place much later.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><u>To request a refund, we ask you to do the following:</u></p>
<p>Forward the payment confirmation email that you received from Indiegogo, at the moment you supported the Qurelife project, to: info@qurelife.com. We can then make the refund via Paypal. Another refund method is currently not possible, we apologize for any inconvenience. We will make the refund <u>to the email address you use to send us the forward mail.</u> Refunds will be made within two weeks after we receive your e-mail.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that we have not been able to ship the desired product on time, but can currently not help you better than in this way.</p>

TEAM AND STATUS

Qurelife was founded in the Netherlands in 2019 by Bauke Bokma, who was frustrated that he did not always have the right self-care products with him and therefore could not always help himself or others.
Either the medicines were out of date, or he just didn't have the right items in house, while some drawers were overflowing with certain bandages. 
An IT platform, where you can make the right choice in advance to be prepared for the future, was the outcome. Development started in June 2019, with a team of professionals; A combination of IT specialists and pharmacists.
The basis of self-care is first aid. Most first aid kits on the market are so old-fashioned and unattractive that Bauke also decided to make a nicely designed kit; ‘My Base Box’.
The Qurelife selfcare platform will be open from July 2021.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Obesity: A Pandemic is a book that discusses the obesity crisis in the west, specifically the historical circumstances surrounding it, its current affects on our society today along with its causes, various myths surrounding obesity.<br/><br/>My name is Akash Raju and I am the author of Obesity: A Pandemic. I wrote this book because I wanted to educate readers on the reality of the obesity crisis in the U.S from a holistic perspective so that they may use what they learned to make informed decisions on how they can contribute to stop the crisis or even simply make a healthier change in their own lifestyles.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the pervasive impact obesity has on our society that is often overlooked. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to understand the personal experiences people have with obesity and how this human aspect intersects with the structural affects of obesity on the country.</p>
<p>You will love this book if you are dealing with obesity or know someone who is and wants to overcome it, interested in how our healthcare problems in the U.S and obesity are related, or are looking to make a difference in promoting a healthier and happier America.<br/><br/>Obesity: A Pandemic speaks to every day people looking to live healthier lifestyles and people involved in the medical field who want to grapple with how obesity raises healthcare costs and worsens quality of life.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that Obesity: A Pandemic inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the different aspects of a person’s life that obesity affects and how?</li>
<li>How have historical circumstances shaped obesity in the modern day U.S?</li>
<li>Moving forward, what are effective strategies we can use to reduce obesity on a community basis?</li>
</ul>
<p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing the more human aspect of the obesity crisis alongside its structural affects will change us all for the better.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in April , 2021</li>
<li>The cover design of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)</li>
<li>The layout design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).</li>
<li>The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</li>
<li>The launch &amp; promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this Spring of 2021</li>
<li>When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover and an audiobook.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish.</li>
<li>Your name will appear in the Acknowledgments section of my book.</li>
<li>You will receive early access to the Author’s Note and other excerpts from my book, with the opportunity to review it and give me early feedback.</li>
<li>You will have the opportunity to be involved in selecting my cover and title.</li>
<li>You will be invited to join my Author Community and get behind-the-scenes sneak peeks into the publishing process.</li>
</ul>
<p>And much more!</p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you.

</div></div>","Short Summary
Obesity: A Pandemic is a book that discusses the obesity crisis in the west, specifically the historical circumstances surrounding it, its current affects on our society today along with its causes, various myths surrounding obesity.My name is Akash Raju and I am the author of Obesity: A Pandemic. I wrote this book because I wanted to educate readers on the reality of the obesity crisis in the U.S from a holistic perspective so that they may use what they learned to make informed decisions on how they can contribute to stop the crisis or even simply make a healthier change in their own lifestyles.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the pervasive impact obesity has on our society that is often overlooked. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to understand the personal experiences people have with obesity and how this human aspect intersects with the structural affects of obesity on the country.
You will love this book if you are dealing with obesity or know someone who is and wants to overcome it, interested in how our healthcare problems in the U.S and obesity are related, or are looking to make a difference in promoting a healthier and happier America.Obesity: A Pandemic speaks to every day people looking to live healthier lifestyles and people involved in the medical field who want to grapple with how obesity raises healthcare costs and worsens quality of life.Ultimately, I hope that Obesity: A Pandemic inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:

What are the different aspects of a person’s life that obesity affects and how?
How have historical circumstances shaped obesity in the modern day U.S?
Moving forward, what are effective strategies we can use to reduce obesity on a community basis?

I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing the more human aspect of the obesity crisis alongside its structural affects will change us all for the better.

What We Need & What You Get
This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:

The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.
The launch & promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this Spring of 2021
When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover and an audiobook.

I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:

Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you.

<p></p>
<p>One Path Outreach is a humanitarian relief program that seeks support to provide health care, education, and basic necessities to remote villages of Eastern Tibet. We seek to provide immediate relief through voluntary clinical care and basic supplies while helping promote long-term improvement by collaborating with local communities to create systemic change.</p>One Path Outreach believes all beings should have access to adequate health care, education, and basic necessities. We believe that all people share “one path” and that is the desire to live in health, happiness, and harmony.<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>How You Can Help</h3> <p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">It is our goal to raise $50,000. The majority raised will cover supplies to directly address immediate needs in the region as well as to cover the operating expenses of mobilizing our all-volunteer staff of medical professionals. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Your donation is tax-deductible. Our partner, The Dzogchen Shri Singha Foundation, is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, and is helping to manage the distribution of funds, so your donation is fully tax-deductible. </span></p>
<p>In-kind donations such as travel and accommodation expenses and medical and non-medical supplies are also graciously accepted. To inquire about making this type of donation, please contact us.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We are also accepting medical professionals and other volunteers to join us on our inaugural mission. All volunteer services and administration are completely pro bono. </p>
<h3>Together We Can Make A Difference</h3>
<p></p>
<b></b><p>Our current project is a medical mission to the Dzogchen Area in Kham, Tibet, in the western part of the Sichuan Province of China. Our goal is to provide mobile clinics offering basic medical examinations, dental care, vision care, woman’s health, and health education. There is a great need for the most basic care and supplies, and your support is instrumental to providing these.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>One Person Makes A Great Impact</h3> <p>Your contribution is valuable and much appreciated. Whether it's in the form of donations, volunteer services, or spreading the word, your participation is essential to bringing immediate relief to people geographically isolated from some of the necessities for basic health.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Challenges</h3> <p>Time is of the essence.

</div></div>","Reaching Out & Bringing Relief 

One Path Outreach is a humanitarian relief program that seeks support to provide health care, education, and basic necessities to remote villages of Eastern Tibet. We seek to provide immediate relief through voluntary clinical care and basic supplies while helping promote long-term improvement by collaborating with local communities to create systemic change.One Path Outreach believes all beings should have access to adequate health care, education, and basic necessities. We believe that all people share “one path” and that is the desire to live in health, happiness, and harmony.   How You Can Help 
It is our goal to raise $50,000. The majority raised will cover supplies to directly address immediate needs in the region as well as to cover the operating expenses of mobilizing our all-volunteer staff of medical professionals. 
Your donation is tax-deductible. Our partner, The Dzogchen Shri Singha Foundation, is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, and is helping to manage the distribution of funds, so your donation is fully tax-deductible. 
In-kind donations such as travel and accommodation expenses and medical and non-medical supplies are also graciously accepted. To inquire about making this type of donation, please contact us.

We are also accepting medical professionals and other volunteers to join us on our inaugural mission. All volunteer services and administration are completely pro bono. 
Together We Can Make A Difference

Our current project is a medical mission to the Dzogchen Area in Kham, Tibet, in the western part of the Sichuan Province of China. Our goal is to provide mobile clinics offering basic medical examinations, dental care, vision care, woman’s health, and health education. There is a great need for the most basic care and supplies, and your support is instrumental to providing these.
    One Person Makes A Great Impact Your contribution is valuable and much appreciated. Whether it's in the form of donations, volunteer services, or spreading the word, your participation is essential to bringing immediate relief to people geographically isolated from some of the necessities for basic health.   Challenges Time is of the essence. We have team members now in the region evaluating current needs. Once we have some of these needs prioritized, we will be able to provide more details on the resources required. In the meantime, we need to raise the financial resources that will allow us to meet those needs as soon as possible. We hope to complete our first mission in late August of 2015.   
    Other Ways You Can Help You can help us spread the word and share our campaign on social media. The more awareness we raise, the more resources we can gather to reach our goals.

<p>My name is Austin and 2 and half years ago a tooth infection traveled from my tooth to my brain, causing me a stroke and almost taking my life. After 10 weeks in the hospital and 2 brain surgeries later, I was finally on the road to recovery. My stroke left my right side considerably weak especially my right leg. My right foot has yet to regain full movement and I still walk with difficulty due to a condition called drop foot. </p>
<p>I have continued with physical therapy since my release from the hospital. Through much hard work and a team of therapists I no longer walk with a cane! Though now I am ready to take my recovery further. My Dr. has informed me of a new devise (the Bioness) that will immensely help my foot in helping me achieve my goal of a full recovery.The
 L300 BIONESS Foot Drop System is a revolutionary new medical device that helps 
you regain mobility and independence by lifting your foot as you walk/run. For more information about the L300 Bioness click <a href=""http://www.bioness.com/L300_for_Foot_Drop/What_is_It.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.<br/>  <br/></p>
<p>This devise will not just be my stepping stone along this path of recovery, but it will also help give me my life back. As a former All Star baseball player, and avid snow boarder, my dream is to be active again. So, the first step for me is running! <br/></p>
<p>Please help me on my quest to RUN AGAIN! <br/></p>

My name is Austin and 2 and half years ago a tooth infection traveled from my tooth to my brain, causing me a stroke and almost taking my life. After 10 weeks in the hospital and 2 brain surgeries later, I was finally on the road to recovery. My stroke left my right side considerably weak especially my right leg. My right foot has yet to regain full movement and I still walk with difficulty due to a condition called drop foot. 
I have continued with physical therapy since my release from the hospital. Through much hard work and a team of therapists I no longer walk with a cane! Though now I am ready to take my recovery further. My Dr. has informed me of a new devise (the Bioness) that will immensely help my foot in helping me achieve my goal of a full recovery.The
 L300 BIONESS Foot Drop System is a revolutionary new medical device that helps 
you regain mobility and independence by lifting your foot as you walk/run. For more information about the L300 Bioness click here.  
This devise will not just be my stepping stone along this path of recovery, but it will also help give me my life back. As a former All Star baseball player, and avid snow boarder, my dream is to be active again. So, the first step for me is running! 
Please help me on my quest to RUN AGAIN!

</h3>
<p><i><b>Why most of us instantly think of burgers or fries when speaking about fast food? </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>Why is fast food usually claimed to be unhealthy?</b></i><br/></p>
<p>Hi! We are Jaanika and Mirje, two food enthusiasts whose mission is to bring a new and <b>healthy perspective to fast food</b>. Together we have been working in food business and in the customer service field for 20 years. And that's enough to feel the need to make a positive change in that field. </p>
<p> Our aim is to provide fresh, nutritious and tasty fast food that your body appreciates and that keeps your energy flowing all day long. Healthy fast food is something that we ourselves have been missing and talking about for quite some time now, but it is still pretty hard to find it here in Estonia. Therefore, we need to help ourselves, our friends (many of them are also carried away by the idea) and our community to make it possible to get some tasty, healthy and fresh fast food.</p>We will offer freshly made<b> salads, soups, smoothies, fresh juice and healthy snacks</b>. We have a fixed menu with some of the most popular items. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Besides that, everyone has the chance to create their own salad or smoothie from preferred ingredients. </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The food is put together according to the clients' order on the spot and from the great variety of ingredients. Our aim is to give people a chance to try out the new products on the healthy nutrition field. </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Also, people with special dietary needs</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">have plenty to choose from</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> (vegans, lactose or gluten intolerants).</span>
</div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Our food is handily packed for take-away so that it can be enjoyed everywhere - on a park bench, strolling around the festival, in the office... wherever!</span></div><div>Our <b>future vision is to become the first healthy fast food chain in Estonia</b>, making the healthy eating options accessible and convinient for as many people as possible. But ofcourse it can't be done overnight, so we see opening a healthy fast food caravan as a good way to start. It would allow us to be mobile and move throughout the country, visiting festivals, meeting people and making ourselves and the healthy fast food concept visible. </div><div><br/></div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3>
<div>
<b>Our goal is to get the food caravan on the road ALREADY in THIS SUMMER</b>. We have the caravan picked out and it will go into reconstructioning works during the next weeks. Part of the project is already covered by our own funds, the business start-up support from the Estonian Unemployment Insurance Funds and by the support of our loved ones. </div>
<div>Still, to prepare and provide food, we need appropriate kitchen equipment. Although we have made compromises regarding prices and some of the equipment will be in second use, the cost of the whole list is a bit difficult to handle at the moment and here is where we need your assistance.<b> The funds raised in Indigogo will go to outfit the caravan with kitchen equipment</b>.<br/>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In today's busy life fast food has become an inevitable part of urban lifestyle, but in Estonia, healthy fast food is rather hard to find. At the same time there are way too many people <b>suffering from food related diseases like cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, metabolic syndrome</b> etc. Sadly cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide and Estonia ranks on the very top of that fatal chart. We understand, that to deal with that issue on lager scale, peoples' mindset about healthy lifestyle and nutrition needs some change. But creating opportunities for healthy alternatives is a step towards that change and we see many hints in society giving us confidence, that our idea is needed and appreciated.</p>
<p>Although our project has its biggest impact on a local level, it definately contributes to a similar change on global level, working towards the common consciousness about healthier eating choices and healthier lifes.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> As our project will be first one of it's kind in Estonia it is an experiment for us as well, but we are optimistic and see great potential. To assure that it is not only us living our dream, we conducted a reasearch to find out, if healthy fast food is really required. We asked 100 people to answer 10 simple questions about their eating habits and what they value or miss in fast food. What we found was stunning. More than half of respondents expressed that it's rather difficult to find fast food according to their needs or wishes. They would love to see more healthy options and less fatty or junk food in the fast food field. </p>
<p>We have also had a lot of great feedback and support from the people around and it seems that besides us, there is a whole crowd outside who believes in us! Yaaayy!!<br/></p>

You can be grounded all day and night!Reconnect to the EarthEverybody knows that the SUN's energy is crucial for all life and for good health, but guess what…the EARTH’s energy is too! The Sun’s rays and roughly 5000 lightning strikes that occur every minute help to recharge the earth’s negative energy field.And when we touch our skin to the surface of the earth, our bodies receive a charge of electrons that helps us to stay healthy. This is called grounding or earthing.Of course this isn’t new news…before modern times, people were always outdoors and naturally absorbing the earth’s energy.Obviously things are a lot different today. We live most of our lives indoors. And even when we do go outside, we are often walking on asphalt and wearing shoes which prevent us from absorbing the energy or electrons from the earth.It’s actually no wonder why so many people feel tired, sluggish, fatigued, stressed, sick and achy, because we go for days or even weeks without ever connecting to the earth. This lack of connection causes electron deficiency!Radiant Health™ Products Connect You To the Earth 24/7!But guess what?  You can start receiving the benefits of grounding by going barefoot outside. This alone can be life changing…and it’s free! And when you can’t get grounded outdoors, you can use the Radiant Health grounding mat and bed sheet to get grounded while you’re indoors too!Our state of the art, patent pending grounding mat is made of biodegradable, toxic free TPE foam with a conductive and antimicrobial cotton/silver fabric on top of it. You simply plug the cord into the grounding hole of an outlet, which directly connects to the existing grounding rod of your home.And our super comfortable grounding sheet is made of an ultra-soft, highly conductive Egyptian cotton and silver blend fabric with a cord that plugs into your grounding outlet. You can use it at home or even when you when you travel.This connection to the earth lets you safely receive the earth’s electrons while you’re sleeping just as if you were sleeping outside under the stars.When you sleep grounded, you’ll heal faster, sleep deeper, feel more rested and refreshed in the morning, and will wake up looking and feeling radiant! And it even helps to eliminate snoring!Here' a video that demonstrates how our products ground your body:
The Ultimate Antioxidant!Being grounded provides antioxidants in the form of electrons. Antioxidants are elements that help protect your body’s cells from free radical damage.Free radicals are unstable molecules that can do damage to your cells and organs and cause inflammation and accelerated aging. Antioxidants like COQ10 and vitamin C help to neutralize these harmful free radicals.Guess what! Being grounded is the ultimate antioxidant! Thousands of studies have shown the link between chronic inflammation and many common diseases like diabetes, heart disease, hypothyroidism and even cancer. Inflammation slowly and gradually increases in the body over time especially when you’re not grounded.I have been in the wellness industry for 15 years, and this is the most GROUND BREAKING discovery I’ve come across. Here’s a short list of some of the health benefits of grounding:§  Reduces inflammation by defusing excess positive electrons§  Reduces chronic pain§  Improves sleep §  Increases energy §  Helps regulate blood sugar levels§  Lowers stress and promotes calmness by reducing stress hormones.§  Normalizes biological rhythms including circadian rhythm§  Helps to sync the left and right brain§  Improves blood pressure and blood flow§  Relieves muscle tension and headache §  Lessens menstrual and female hormone symptoms§  Speeds healing and wound repair§  Can eliminate jet lag§  Protects your body from EMFs§  Shortens recovery time from injury or athletic activity§  Reduces or eliminates snoring§  Helps  support adrenal health Radiant Health™ Products are Toxin Free!Simply put, our grounding products act as a conduit that connect you to the healing energy of the earth. Yet products like grounding mats aren’t even new. Companies like 3M have been making grounding products for industrial and electronic clean room environments for decades.But unfortunately, the clean room isn’t very clean. Existing products are made from conductive PVC or carbonized rubber…which are toxic and even carcinogenic…and you do NOT want to be touching your bare skin to these materials.Radiant Health products are always made with toxin free materials that feel comfortable on your skin.A Vision to HealSara & I have been in the health & wellness industry for 25 years combined. We have developed over 20 different products that have been sold in over 100 countries. Radiant Health is our passion! As we reach each our funding goals, we will introduce other awesome grounding products like a car mat, fitted bed sheets, a pet sheet and more. We want to help thousands of people feel better and live radiantly!Here's more about us:

</p><h3>I have been diagnosed with a rare form of kidney cancer. It is incurable.
My doctors say I have less than a year to live. Please help me by providing a
peaceful, end-of-life environment, free of financial worries while pursuing some artistic projects.</h3>
<p>For those of you
who know me--well, this is a bit of a shocker. At 53 years old? I've been involved in the arts for over 25 years, and I received a Ph.D. in Music Composition from Princeton University in 2002. In 2011, I
moved to New York City to start a new life in art business. Everything was going so well. I earned an Art Business Certificate from NYU-SCPS, and I was preparing to launch an online art gallery. And
then the cancer really hit in July 2013.  I did indeed launch my business, continued to work my part-time jobs until August and then I had surgery for the removal of my left kidney in September 2013. Since my surgery, I've been unable to work. The worst is, of course, that the cancer has metastasized to my lungs and remaining kidney. My prognosis has gone from iffy to 0% survival rate. Living in NYC with a terminal illness was isolating and frightening. I relocated to Portland, Oregon, in March 2014 to be near old friends, and a less stressful medical atmosphere. I also really look forward to complete some writing, painting (anyone want to teach me about gouache?), maybe hosting a soiree. I'm asking for your support on Indiegogo for a peaceful, end-of-life environment. Most important: that you have a place to stay if you visit or just hang out with me!</p>
<p><b>What I need:</b></p>
<p>- Support for six
months of living expenses: rent, utilities, food (and some medical ones outside of insurance
coverage).</p>
<p>- I have no income
other than social security benefits. (My  business hasn't earned a profit.) This isn't enough.</p>
<p><b>How you're helping:</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>- You're providing
me with independence and control over my final months.</p><p>- Support me living in an apartment, not a Medicaid facility.</p>
UPDATE (May 7, 2014): 
<p>I have very sad news to report. This past Sunday at 12:15am,
Mary passed away. She had recently been diagnosed with pneumonia and seemed to
be doing okay on a round of antibiotics, but then suddenly her condition
worsened a couple of days ago and she was taken to the ICU at Meridian Park Hospital.
Her daughter Azul immediately flew from the East Coast to be with her and was
able to sit by her side, along with friends and family, for the last two hours
of her life. </p>
<p> I want everyone to
know how much your donation of support meant to Mary. She was truly amazed and
touched that so many of her friends (some even from high school whom she hadn’t
spoken to in years) rallied to help her. Mary was stunned that she was able to
reach original goal in only two days. It really boosted her spirits when she
was feeling low. She had her “perfect” downtown Portland apartment picked out
and had even begun to move in furniture and was planning visits to the nearby
art museum and classes in gouache painting.</p>
<p>When I found out that Mary had pneumonia, I asked her what
she would like the Indiegogo money to go towards in case anything happened to
her. She told me that she would really like a monetary fund to be set up for
Azul. (Azul is about to complete her junior year at Connecticut College.)</p>
<p>We also realize that there might be outstanding medical
bills, the first month’s rent on her apartment, and end-of-life expenses. We
would like to use the money for these purposes and then dedicate any remaining
funds towards a fund for Azul.</p>
<p>Mary’s family wanted me to let you know that they are in the
process of planning a memorial service in Portland for Mary and will announce
details soon.  If you have a question
regarding your Indiegogo contribution, please post it in the “Comment” section
of the page and I will do my best to answer it (and check the “keep private
box” if you wish to do so). Once again, I thank you for your contribution.</p>
<p>We will all miss Mary so much.</p>

<p class=""Default"">My name is Wes Jeffers, and I live in Brazzaville, Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p class=""Default"">One of my greatest passions here is helping the disabled community. I have often asked for your help in doing this. One last time, I am asking for your help to change 12 peoples’ lives before I leave the Congo permanently in August.</p>
<p class=""Default""> </p>
<p class=""Default""><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p>
<p class=""Default"">Please consider making a donation to Sister Yengo’s Children and help change the life of someone afflicted by the ravages of Polio. Polio is still a tragic threat in most of Sub-Saharan Africa. In the Republic of the Congo, those unable to afford a wheelchair are left with no other option than to drag their bodies through the streets to get around town; often using flip-flops to protect their hands.</p>
<p class=""Default"">Sister Brigitte Yengo, a Congolese Roman Catholic nun, has created a safe and loving home for orphaned children, the mentally disabled and handicapped Congolese with no where else to turn. She is their champion and their provider.</p>
<p class=""Default"">I have worked closely with Sister Yengo and her amazing kids since arriving in Congo in 2011. She’s the real deal. Your donation can really change the life of someone struggling with more pain and sorrow than you could even imagine. Please donate whatever you can! Every dollar counts!</p>
<p class=""Default""> </p>
<p class=""Default""><strong>The Goal</strong></p>
<p class=""Default"">Our idea is to raise enough money to donate at 12 wheelchairs to Sister Yengo’s Children and the Centre des Polios. Not only does a chair provide mobility, but also a sense of freedom, self-worth and a job. Thanks to Sister Yengo’s efforts, these three-wheeled chairs are also fabricated by handicapped people.</p>
<p class=""Default"">All parts are purchased locally and assembled right here in Brazzaville. One chair costs roughly $500.00 USD or 250,000 CFA (local currency). Our goal is $6500.00 USD or the equivalent of 12 chairs + fees.</p>
<p class=""Default"">Our challenge is that we do not have much time - however, I KNOW we can do this. This is a cause I believe very strongly in, and I want it to be one of the final things I am able to do before leaving the Congo permanently. I can't do it without your help!</p></div>","Who Am I?

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Hi, there! My name is Maria Irene and I live in Puerto Rico. I’m speaking on behalf of my daughter, Maria Isabel. She was born prematurely at 24 weeks last September. Unfortunately, she had gone through most of the complications premature babies could have. She was 1 lb 11 oz and 13 in long; at 5 days she had an intracranial level 4 bleeding; at 3 weeks she had a perforation on her guts sending her to surgery one week later to have a colostomy performed to allow her intestines to heal and grow. Almost a month later she had a Pulmonary Duct Artery surgery, to, then, had the diagnostic of Retinopathy of Premature, and be sent to Michigan for another surgery, which will prevent condition to progress and allow her to see. Throughout this process, she had so many blood and plasma transfusions we can’t count them along with respiratory problems, the collapsing of her lungs, blood stream and urine infections, among others. As of now, she suffers from Short Guts Syndrome, Retinopathy of Premature, Congenital Glaucoma and Failure to Thrive.</p>

<p>Campaign Description and why is important to me.</p>
<p>I’m trying to raise funds to pay what I owe to the hospital for medical services received back in December 2011, for other medical services received this past April and May that we didn’t expect and were not covered by the Catastrophic Funds for Remediable Illnesses of Puerto Rico, and for next surgery, which we will be given the new date as soon as we pay the bill. Catastrophic Funds took care of the first ROP surgery, NICU fees and all things involved in the process, as well as the fees related only to the surgery for the second time. Unfortunately, they only give out help once, and we were lucky to have the second approval. For this time we are on our own. I haven’t been able to go back to work after my maternity was over; my fiancée is taking care of all my bills as well as his, and my family has limited income. </p>
<p>I want to give my baby the best even if I have to beg for money out on the streets. She has gone through so many things in her short life and I don’t want to quit simply because I don’t have the money to pay for medical services… It’s not fair for her!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The magnitude of what contributors will help me achieve.</p>
<p>With this third non-contemplated intervention, I have to find the money, and make the deposit before getting there. As the previous eye surgeries, we had a short notice for this situation; there’s no way I can get $25,000 US in less than a month working in a part-time job. I also need to find money for travel and lodging expenses, as well as for medication, and living expenses in a city that has weather completely different as mine. We went for a checkup of Little Maria’s high pressure in her eyes and the ophthalmologist told me she can’t work on Little Maria’s eyes until her retinal problem is solved. One thing leads to another… we don’t know if this intervention will solve the problem or if she will need more surgeries in the future until surgeon check her eyes.</p>
<p> </p>

<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In simple words, I need money for:</p>
<p>A)    My baby’s eye surgery at the William Beaumont Children’s Hospital, in Royal Oak, Michigan, sometime in the early months of 2013.</p>
<p>B)    Air transportation for my mom and I from Puerto Rico to Michigan</p>
<p>C)    Lodging arrangements for a minimum of 3 weeks, unless surgeon says we can leave before</p>
<p>D)    Living expenses, which includes food, transportation, Laundromats, and very little entertainment (mom does not speaks English and can’t walk much)</p>
<p>E)     Medication and other baby needs</p>
<p>F)     Pay bill from previous visits to same hospital</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are some perks for the first persons who claim them. They are very simple and all of them will include a thank you note and a picture of my baby taken after we return to Puerto Rico. With each higher donation will be an add-on item made by myself in a limited edition.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If I don’t reach the goal, everything will be put towards the bill I actually have with the hospital, which will grow to I don’t know how much. Right now it should be over the $40,000.00 US. If I over pass the goal and have enough to clear my debt and there’s a residual, that will be used to buy medications not covered by my medical insurance (which does not cover anything outside Puerto Rico, and kept available to help other Puerto Rican families traveling to the same hospital for the same surgery.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Why my project is valuable to the contributor and to the world.</p>
<p>There’s a world out there. I want my baby as well as other babies to see it. And also, there’s a medical condition that is not very well known, that can be treated and understand if we start to speak more about it. Never in my life had I heard about Retinopathy… never the less, in a premature baby. I never met someone before giving birth to a premature baby who was also premature; and it happens to be that my neighbor was one twin-6 month-miracle baby from the 1930’s!! We need to start speaking about premature babies, the complications and conditions they face, the ROP, and about Congenital Glaucoma, which in my baby’s case happens to be a side-effect from the Retinopathy of the Premature as I read in the letter Dr. Capone, Retinal Surgeon, sent to Dr. Perez, my baby’s Pediatric Retinologyst.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I promise I’ll upload pictures of the process for you to know that its true all what I’m saying and asking for…</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can’t contribute with money right now, please, read more about Retinopathy of Premature and Congenital Glaucoma. Visit the nearest NICU and ask how you can help for preemies. If you know how to sew, knit or crochet, please, make a donation of some items needed like really small clothing and booties, I had nothing to put on my baby until she was 4 months; everything was huge!! Right now she is still small; she is 1 year old still is wearing newborn and 0-3 months clothing!!</p>

Introduction
Hi, there! My name is Maria Irene and I live in Puerto Rico. I’m speaking on behalf of my daughter, Maria Isabel. She was born prematurely at 24 weeks last September. Unfortunately, she had gone through most of the complications premature babies could have. She was 1 lb 11 oz and 13 in long; at 5 days she had an intracranial level 4 bleeding; at 3 weeks she had a perforation on her guts sending her to surgery one week later to have a colostomy performed to allow her intestines to heal and grow. Almost a month later she had a Pulmonary Duct Artery surgery, to, then, had the diagnostic of Retinopathy of Premature, and be sent to Michigan for another surgery, which will prevent condition to progress and allow her to see. Throughout this process, she had so many blood and plasma transfusions we can’t count them along with respiratory problems, the collapsing of her lungs, blood stream and urine infections, among others. As of now, she suffers from Short Guts Syndrome, Retinopathy of Premature, Congenital Glaucoma and Failure to Thrive.
 
Campaign Description and why is important to me.
I’m trying to raise funds to pay what I owe to the hospital for medical services received back in December 2011, for other medical services received this past April and May that we didn’t expect and were not covered by the Catastrophic Funds for Remediable Illnesses of Puerto Rico, and for next surgery, which we will be given the new date as soon as we pay the bill. Catastrophic Funds took care of the first ROP surgery, NICU fees and all things involved in the process, as well as the fees related only to the surgery for the second time. Unfortunately, they only give out help once, and we were lucky to have the second approval. For this time we are on our own. I haven’t been able to go back to work after my maternity was over; my fiancée is taking care of all my bills as well as his, and my family has limited income. 
I want to give my baby the best even if I have to beg for money out on the streets. She has gone through so many things in her short life and I don’t want to quit simply because I don’t have the money to pay for medical services… It’s not fair for her!
 
The magnitude of what contributors will help me achieve.
With this third non-contemplated intervention, I have to find the money, and make the deposit before getting there. As the previous eye surgeries, we had a short notice for this situation; there’s no way I can get $25,000 US in less than a month working in a part-time job. I also need to find money for travel and lodging expenses, as well as for medication, and living expenses in a city that has weather completely different as mine. We went for a checkup of Little Maria’s high pressure in her eyes and the ophthalmologist told me she can’t work on Little Maria’s eyes until her retinal problem is solved. One thing leads to another… we don’t know if this intervention will solve the problem or if she will need more surgeries in the future until surgeon check her eyes.
 


What We Need & What You Get
In simple words, I need money for:
A)    My baby’s eye surgery at the William Beaumont Children’s Hospital, in Royal Oak, Michigan, sometime in the early months of 2013.
B)    Air transportation for my mom and I from Puerto Rico to Michigan

D)    Living expenses, which includes food, transportation, Laundromats, and very little entertainment (mom does not speaks English and can’t walk much)
E)     Medication and other baby needs
F)     Pay bill from previous visits to same hospital
 
There are some perks for the first persons who claim them. They are very simple and all of them will include a thank you note and a picture of my baby taken after we return to Puerto Rico. With each higher donation will be an add-on item made by myself in a limited edition.
 
If I don’t reach the goal, everything will be put towards the bill I actually have with the hospital, which will grow to I don’t know how much. Right now it should be over the $40,000.00 US.

</ul></div>","Short SummaryAbout UsWe are a group of 30 Oracle Java Certified/ Android developers hailing from a tier 4 village in Kerala who have joined together to create next generation software solutions. We want to increase the life chances of millions of people who are running micro businesses using the sinews of technology. The tireless locomotion which will drive us to this triumph is powered by people like you – with virtuousness tattooed in their body. Our association should hardwire energies, creativity, competitiveness, grace and entrepreneurship of untold proportions in you. Together, Let us Script our FutureWhat is CashCow POS ? Point-of-Sale technology is not accessible or affordable to the micro businesses. We stand to fill that gap by providing a solution:An integrated, affordable and scale-able ""Designer"" POS ( Point of Sale) solution for the corner shops :cheap from a cost point-of-view; best from a technology point-of-view.As a first cut, A standalone unit complete with touch-screen, thermal printer and POS software would be delivered at  $250 (USD).Our ultimate goal is to deliver the world's cheapest POS solution priced at $99 (USD).POS would be easily customizable for use by groceries, vegetables shops, bakery, food joints, hardware stores, hair saloons, gift shops etc.

With a vision to make POS affordable to even a small-time cornershop,With a focus on business growth leveraging technology, We are planning to  launch CASHCOW POS, the cheapest POS that should revolutionize the small businesses. This work was inspired from an opensource project from Openbravo (www.openbravo.com). Ours is a complete rewrite upgrading the technology stack, porting it to a smaller footprint machine,  offsetting major shortcomings in the  openbravo version, adding brand new features: leverage mobility, cloud and other technology advancements. The crucial goal is to make our Point of Sale (POS) solution cheapest and affordable for small corner shops without any compromise on quality. The initial spade work ( Proof-of-Concept) is under development and we are excited with the response we get. The local corner shops are excited to get their hands on this product.  We are looking for your support to further develop and make the product internationally available.
Technology Stack
A combination of Java and Android would be used on an ARM processor. For eg: Raspberry Pi / CubieBoard / Beagleboard(Image courtesy: http://www.raspberrypi.org/ )a credit-card sized computer to build this solution. Touchscreens would be integrated along with this, together with other POS peripherals like bar code scanners, weighing scales,cash box, payment integration etc.Sample Screen shots from the Prototype:Login ScreenRestaurant  POS - Menu CardRestaurant POS - Order

New doors are opening with regard to DNA, your health and well-being and that of your family and children.<br/></span></p>
<p>One of the most important discoveries is that DNA changes in response to our life-style choices and our daily environmental exposure to chemicals, radiation, air pollution, cigarettes, even to extreme psychological stress. Those changes can be passed to future generations!<span>  Wouldn't it be helpful if your children and grandchildren knew the predispositions that your DNA has passed forward?</span></p>
<p>Today, scientists are able to use early, pre-exposure DNA to treat
post-exposure mutations resulting in cancer, diabetes, heart disease and other conditions in lab animals. Within this decade, DNA taken from earlier in your life will be used to <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/tech/nanoparticles-and-the-future-of-medicine/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">prevent or treat medical conditions</a> occurring later in your life or your children's lives. Your DNA could help future generations predict, prevent and treat medical conditions.<span>  </span></p>
<p>With such rapid progress being made, doesn't it make practical sense to store your DNA and keep it easily accessible to you and to your family?<span>  </span>As DNA tests become less and less expensive and more and more understood, your stored DNA will open doors to information that will help your children and grandchildren in ways not yet known.</p>
<p>By storing your DNA, you are actually storing life for you, your family and for future generations.</p>

<p>Again, by storing your DNA, you are actually storing life for future generations.<span>  As DNA tests become less and less expensive and more and more understood, your stored DNA will open doors to your family tree at a much deeper level.  Your children and grandchildren will have access to DNA information that will help them access undiscovered, hidden ancestors.</span></p>

</div></div>","Although this campaign is over, we are excited to announce that recent scientific discoveries support the emerging market that our products address. As a result, our website is changing.  However, you can still visit us at genisyss.com to sign up for early notification about the re-launch of  our products for purchase.For those who have already purchased, no worries.  It's the same product.  We're simply changing its name and refining our marketing approach.  We learned from this campaign and appreciate all of you who purchased.  You will be receiving product by the Holidays toward mid December.
Covered in over 340 publications and broadcast stations.  These are a few:
Why DNA and Why You?
Now you can store DNA as a tiny drop of blood on a digital memory drive and keep it in your personal possession.  Why is that important to you?  Because science is discovering new things about DNA that impacts your life right now and for the future. New doors are opening with regard to DNA, your health and well-being and that of your family and children.
One of the most important discoveries is that DNA changes in response to our life-style choices and our daily environmental exposure to chemicals, radiation, air pollution, cigarettes, even to extreme psychological stress. Those changes can be passed to future generations!  Wouldn't it be helpful if your children and grandchildren knew the predispositions that your DNA has passed forward?
Today, scientists are able to use early, pre-exposure DNA to treat
post-exposure mutations resulting in cancer, diabetes, heart disease and other conditions in lab animals. Within this decade, DNA taken from earlier in your life will be used to prevent or treat medical conditions occurring later in your life or your children's lives. Your DNA could help future generations predict, prevent and treat medical conditions.  
With such rapid progress being made, doesn't it make practical sense to store your DNA and keep it easily accessible to you and to your family?  As DNA tests become less and less expensive and more and more understood, your stored DNA will open doors to information that will help your children and grandchildren in ways not yet known.
By storing your DNA, you are actually storing life for you, your family and for future generations.
Give Life to Your Loved Ones for the Holidays
We're pre-selling our patented Capsules for delivery this holiday 
season.  These great gifts are small enough to be stocking stuffers.  You'll be giving life in the form of stored DNA together with digital memory.  Either include your own DNA and stories or give it as a blank Capsule ready to store the recipient's DNA, important information and special memories:

A tiny drop of blood in the DNA wells on the capsule with...
Digital, encrypted and password-protected customized software for... 
Videos, audios, pictures, documents, medical information, family 
tree and whatever you choose to be uploaded to this ""time capsule"" of 
life.

The DNA is stored as a tiny drop of blood in a small well containing 
material that kills any bacteria or viruses.  The DNA dries and is safely
 stored.  It's the same material many scientists use to store DNA at room temperature.
GENiSYSS Capsules are small time capsules of life.
Our patented GENiSYSS Capsules are thumb-drive sized products that focus on DNA as the core of life.  Each product has 4 or 8 storage wells containing special, patented material to safely store a tiny drop of blood for many years at room temperature.
The digital memory, varying from 2GB to 8GB depending on the Capsule,contains customized software, encrypted and password-protected, compatible with Windows operating systems.  It is designed to easily step you through the process of storing crucial information about your family and future
generations.  This includes medical information and your priceless memories in the forms of videos, audios, photos, stories, family tree and genealogy and more.
See the rewards to the right to understand the various products we have available for delivery by the holidays.  Give Life for the Holidays!  Consider the bundles that include our Capsule.  Produce a ""Family Ethical Will"" that records your values and stories or those of your parents or grandparents.
Child Safety Capsule
How is DNA related to child safety?  GENiSYSS uses exclusive, 
patented technology to provide peace of mind for parents.  In case of 
emergency, ALL the information crucial to law enforcement and medical 
responders is immediately available, including the child's DNA which is a
 far better marker than simply fingerprints.  Time is of the essence in 
emergency situations. With the GENiSYSS Child Safety Capsule, everything
 is quickly accessible and at the parent's fingertips.


The Child Safety Capsule contains 4 DNA wells plus encrypted, custom software on 2 GB of digital memory.  The size of a thumb drive, it is designed to attach to the parent's keychain.  Never before has DNA been 
this easy to store or easily accessible for emergency uses.
The beauty of the Child Safety Capsule is that it stores DNA from early in the child's life.  Therefore, the DNA could be valuable in the child's adult life to help prevent and treat disease.  Moving forward more, their early DNA could help future generations predict and prevent medical conditions.  Team DeLorean is sponsored every year by GENiSYSS in the Fireball Run .  Each year the missing child assigned to Team DeLorean has been found due to the increased exposure given by this exciting, 2000-mile race across regions of the United States.  This year, two girls have been assigned to our Team DeLorean racing from Frisco Texas to Independence, Missouri starting September 27 through October 8.  Click here for Team DeLorean's Facebook page and here to watch live, but FIRST, get your own Child Safety Capsule to keep your child's DNA and important information for early responders to disasters.
A child is abducted every 8 1/2 minutes in the United States.  Marc Klaas, father of Polly Klaas who was abducted and murdered in 1993, formed the KlassKids Foundation in her
memory to help other families of missing children.  KlaasKids endorses the GENiSYSS Child Safety Capsule.
""The KlaasKids Foundation has reviewed and discussed the GENiSYSS Child Safety Capsule at length. We believe that it is superior to any other product in the market. The KlaasKids Foundation fully endorses and supports the GENiSYSS Child Safety Capsule as an important method to store and have rapid access to information needed by law enforcement and medical responders in child abduction cases."" says Marc Klaas.
Storing Priceless Memories


""It goes without saying, that if it goes without saying, it's gone.""  Marcia Orland
Marcia Orland, founder of AfterglowMedia and a personal historian, understands the importance of recording the stories,  personal values and lessons of our parents and grandparents before they're gone. 
Do you have memories associated with a loved one that you don't want to
lose? Now, with GENiSYSS Capsules, you can truly store their life as DNA and the videos, audios, stories, photos, medical information, family tree, genealogy and more.  Bundle a Capsule with Marcia's artistry and services.
GENiSYSS Capsules are small time capsules of life.  They provide
the perfect solution for families to store their DNA at various points in their
life together with life's valuable information on digital memory containing
encrypted and password-protected software designed to step you through the
important information to save.
The Family Vault provides 4 GB of digital memory and 8 wells for safe DNA storage, again on a thumb-drive-size device.  Our
Generations Capsule has 8 GB of memory and 8 DNA wells to store DNA with
important information and memories.
DNA in Genealogy

Ancestry research is growing in popularity as a hobby. DNA testing allows us to trace much further back in history than written records can provide. Online search engines that encourage DNA testing contribute to growing databases similar to the National Geographic's Genographic Project.  With the increasing public participation in DNA testing, it is becoming easier to find clues to a person's heritage as well as to identify living relatives that otherwise may not have been discovered. 

Again, by storing your DNA, you are actually storing life for future generations.  As DNA tests become less and less expensive and more and more understood, your stored DNA will open doors to your family tree at a much deeper level.  Your children and grandchildren will have access to DNA information that will help them access undiscovered, hidden ancestors.
Perk Details
Our GENiSYSS Capsules look similar.  This is a 3-D view of the 4-well version.  You can see that the 8-well would have the white material in the 4 wells on each side:

Thank you all so much for your incredible generosity and so many beautiful messages. </h4><div>I've had just a little bit of time to reflect. I think that when you're facing an illness, beyond the realm of physical pain are complex feelings of anxiety and isolation. I realize tonight that part of the Healing Helpers fund is to do something to make Angie and all of the love surrounding her visible. I want to thank you all because you are showing so much support for Angie. You can still post comments on this page whenever you want.</div><div>
<br/><strong><u>If you haven't yet had the opportunity to make a donation, you still can!</u></strong> </div><div>

</h2>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><strong>I'm running the San Francisco Half Marathon July 31st and ask you to consider supporting me in starting a Healing Helpers Cancer Treatment Fund for my friend and yours, the amazing Angie Wilson.</strong></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I met Angie more than 20 years ago in the fifth grade: she is my oldest friend and she's always encouraged me to embrace who I am. Even back then, Angie already established herself as a free spirit, a persistent seeker and hard worker, a craftswoman, and, most importantly, a courageous heart. <b>It has been amazing to see her grow and develop her many gifts as an adult, and freely give them to others.</b><br/></p>
<p><br/></p><p>For those of you who don't know Angie, the past year+ has been full of huge moments and changes for her and her partner Amber. Amber became tenured at SF City College, they lost their beloved dog Alec, and found a sweet home in their neighborhood in Oakland. <b>Angie turned 30, graduated with her MFA, and was chosen by Headlands Center for the Arts for a prestigious artist-in-residence fellowship for the next 12 months! <a href=""http://www.angiewilson.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Yes, Angie! </a></b></p><p><strong></strong> </p>
<p>But in late May Angie started having chest pains and found a lump on her neck. She was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma. I was shocked and heartbroken that this could happen to my incredible friend. Anyone who has dealt with cancer personally or with a family member knows how scary and uncertain a time this can be. <b>While I still feel in shock, I've been inspired these past few weeks by Angie and Amber's proactive approach to healing. They are being so thoughtful in their choices, researching all of their options, and seeking advice from so many. </b></p>
<p><br/>This is a taxing time physically, spiritually and financially, but the most important thing is for Angie to concentrate on healing. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>I want us all to have the opportunity to show support right from the start. </b></p>
<p><b></b> </p>
<p><b>Please join me in reaching my goal of $2,500 by the SF Half Marathon to start the Healing Helpers Treatment Fund! Thank you and watch me run it out on July 31st!</b></p>
<h2>
<span><br/>What We Need &amp; The Impact</span><br/><b></b>
</h2>
<h3>What is the Healing Helpers Fund? </h3>
<p>This Fund's namesake is the Healing Helpers calendar Amber created for friends to sign up to come over, help with chores, and give hugs. <b>Angie is still in the process of assessing her treatment path for the next year, an integrative approach to cure Hodgkin's Lymphoma. The Healing Helpers Fund will help cover:</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>-medical expenses not covered by Kaiser HMO; this includes costs above and beyond the copay, pricey supplements, side effect reducing treatments like acupuncture, etc.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p><p>-loss of income, and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>-emergency costs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The impact of this fund will go far beyond helping with expenses, you are bringing added peace of mind and inspiration at a tumultuous and stressful time. You are seeding and investing in our amazing Angie's life and her path toward healing.</p>
<p><br/><b>No gift is too large or small, $10, $25...$2500. Contributions of all sizes are so generous and we all can make a big difference together! I am hugely thankful for your consideration and support.</b></p>

</div></div>","***Healing Helpers Update***Your outpouring of support in the first 24 hours is awe-inspiring. Your gifts are so wonderful and will dramatically ease financial burdens for Angie. I had NO IDEA that we would be able to meet the initial goal set in ONE DAY and you all are AWESOME! Thank you all so much for your incredible generosity and so many beautiful messages. I've had just a little bit of time to reflect. I think that when you're facing an illness, beyond the realm of physical pain are complex feelings of anxiety and isolation. I realize tonight that part of the Healing Helpers fund is to do something to make Angie and all of the love surrounding her visible. I want to thank you all because you are showing so much support for Angie. You can still post comments on this page whenever you want.
If you haven't yet had the opportunity to make a donation, you still can! 
 
All gifts above and beyond the initial goal will still go to Angie's significant treatment costs throughout the year and be a part of the Healing Helpers Fund.
I will continue to update this site until race day on July 31st!
Thank you, thank you! Take care and be well,Kristina The Story: A Race for Angie's Cure

I'm running the San Francisco Half Marathon July 31st and ask you to consider supporting me in starting a Healing Helpers Cancer Treatment Fund for my friend and yours, the amazing Angie Wilson.
 
I met Angie more than 20 years ago in the fifth grade: she is my oldest friend and she's always encouraged me to embrace who I am. Even back then, Angie already established herself as a free spirit, a persistent seeker and hard worker, a craftswoman, and, most importantly, a courageous heart. It has been amazing to see her grow and develop her many gifts as an adult, and freely give them to others.
For those of you who don't know Angie, the past year+ has been full of huge moments and changes for her and her partner Amber. Amber became tenured at SF City College, they lost their beloved dog Alec, and found a sweet home in their neighborhood in Oakland. Angie turned 30, graduated with her MFA, and was chosen by Headlands Center for the Arts for a prestigious artist-in-residence fellowship for the next 12 months! Yes, Angie!  
But in late May Angie started having chest pains and found a lump on her neck. She was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma. I was shocked and heartbroken that this could happen to my incredible friend. Anyone who has dealt with cancer personally or with a family member knows how scary and uncertain a time this can be. While I still feel in shock, I've been inspired these past few weeks by Angie and Amber's proactive approach to healing. They are being so thoughtful in their choices, researching all of their options, and seeking advice from so many. 
This is a taxing time physically, spiritually and financially, but the most important thing is for Angie to concentrate on healing. 
 
I want us all to have the opportunity to show support right from the start. 
 
Please join me in reaching my goal of $2,500 by the SF Half Marathon to start the Healing Helpers Treatment Fund! Thank you and watch me run it out on July 31st!

What We Need & The Impact

What is the Healing Helpers Fund? 
This Fund's namesake is the Healing Helpers calendar Amber created for friends to sign up to come over, help with chores, and give hugs. Angie is still in the process of assessing her treatment path for the next year, an integrative approach to cure Hodgkin's Lymphoma. The Healing Helpers Fund will help cover:
 
-medical expenses not covered by Kaiser HMO; this includes costs above and beyond the copay, pricey supplements, side effect reducing treatments like acupuncture, etc.
-loss of income, and
 
-emergency costs.
 
The impact of this fund will go far beyond helping with expenses, you are bringing added peace of mind and inspiration at a tumultuous and stressful time. You are seeding and investing in our amazing Angie's life and her path toward healing.
No gift is too large or small, $10, $25...$2500. Contributions of all sizes are so generous and we all can make a big difference together! I am hugely thankful for your consideration and support.
 

Other Ways You Can Help

The biggest way you can help beyond monetary donations is to SPREAD THE WORD.  
 
All friends of Angie and community members, please see the buttons above and help share this campaign on Twitter, Facebook, or another social media site of your choice!

Support the Nicaragua Community Health ConnectionThe 486 families of Los Robles had no option but to travel at least 10 kilometers to access the nearest medical facility -- until you helped. Now  we need your help even more this holiday season.       A collaboration between Comunidad Connect and Emory University's Social Enterprise @ Goizueta sought to address the healthcare deficiencies in the Los Robles community. The partnership was deemed the Nicaragua Community Health Connection (NCHC). NCHC worked closely last year to facilitate the transfer of US $2 (from people like you) for every volunteer hour logged by a Los Robles resident in order to develop the community's first health clinic.                                                  After thousands of volunteer hours and an endorsement from The Nicaraguan Ministry of Health, the Los Robles Clinic opened mid-summer of 2014. Now, the 486 families have access to a facility with three consultation rooms and an education & outreach pavilion. 

You Can Sustain Health for Los Robles

We are asking for your help to raise $5000 dollars for a nurse's salary by donating your Black Friday savings to NCHC. While the facility has been received with enthusiasm and gratitude from the residents of Los Robles, the commensurate high demand cannot be met without the employment of an additional healthcare professional. By hiring a nurse, The Los Robles Clinic can continue to serve its community. The idea is simple. Save ten bucks on a new pair of shoes? Donate them to NCHC. Saved $200 on a new television? That could go a long way to providing much needed care to the Los Robles community.

  The Impact Free clean air thats it

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Jacey Hulsey/Carter. My Brother was found Dead with no known cause on January 18th 2012, and the police won't tell us all of the truth about what they found.</p>
<p>My mother's heart will now always be broken.</p>
<p>Andy somehow always knew he would die young, and would often tell our mom that she had to take his Ashes to Ireland. She can do it, if you help!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We just need to earn enough money to get her to Ireland for 1 week. Her health is bad, and she's always wanted to go and seek out her roots, so to simply go, spread his ashes, and come home in only a day or two is not a viable option. She would need time to adjust to climate changes, etc, or she could get sick.</p>
<p>She tries to save the money on her own, but ends up having to decide between keeping a roof over their heads, and eating, or taking this important journey. </p>
<p>She's too proud to ask for help, so she doesn't know I'm doing this.</p>
<p>I can't offer you anything except the assurance that it will help to heal our family's pain and lighten the ache in our hearts.</p>
<p>I will try to post a video of her reaction to the donations when we reach our goal.</p>
<p>Every penny donated will go to my mother's Ireland trip and only that.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Andrew was a huge member of the gay community. We often joke about how he knew everyone. You couldn't walk outside with him without bumping into one of his milion friends and acquaintances. </p>
<p>He was also involved with the IRCONU, and subsequently, with all of their fundraising. They often donate large funds to to places like Make-A-Wish, The Trevor Project, Susan G Komen, and more. </p>
<p>There is so much that he has done, for so many people, I can't even begin to describe it. There were over 2,000 people at his wake, which was in the middle of a blizzard. and then we received many notes and letters from people who could not come, but had wanted to.</p>

<h2>Don’t lose the power of your ingredients!<br/>
</h2>
<p>It’s not just about the taste. More importantly, the Dual Shaker™ aims to preserve the potency of the ingredients you are bound to mix, especially in nutrition drinks. For example, Vitamin B12 has been one of the most popular ingredients in nutrition drinks since it is known to boost the body’s metabolization of fats and carbohydrates. However, studies prove that Vitamin B12 has degradation issues or has very short half lives. To give you a detailed idea the Cyanocobalamin vitamin B12 that tends to lose its potency when exposed to light, oxygen, and acid or alkali-containing environments. This is just one example and there are so many other ingredients out there that are prone to losing their power. Here is where the importance of segregation and freshness come in. The Dual Shaker™ does that exactly. The chambers in the Dual Shaker™ prevent contamination so you can have all the power of your ingredients.</p>
<h2>Let me tell you how it all started…</h2>
<p>I am a health enthusiast ever since I could remember. I would hit the gym and engage in sports because this is something I am passionate about. I would always find myself making protein shakes which I thought I fully enjoyed, until I realized I could have it even better.</p>
<p>In preparation for a day’s workout, I would stash my protein shake in my gym bag. When I am ready to have my drink, it’s either the drink is not fresh anymore or it has made a big mess inside my bag because of leakage. This would always be the case whenever I went to the gym to workout, and I would always think that there must be a solution to this.</p>
<p>So I decided to come up with something USEFUL out of the idea – the Dual Shaker™. More importantly, I had lots of FUN along the process and this has kept me inspired since then.</p>

<p>As most of my friends and family know I have been dealing with Chrons Disease/Ulcerative Colitis for over 8 years.  Its consumed majority of my life and over the past 2 years it had gradually gotten worse.  I was hospitalized in October of 2011 for over 2 weeks and had been diagnosed with a virus called Cytomegalovirus which attacks the weak organs in your body.  In my case my liver and colon. </p>
<p>I have tried many medications over the past few years which were doing more harm to my body than good.  As a result of having Chrons/UC I have also been diagnosed with Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (cirrhosis of the liver), Rheumatoid Arthritis, and Osteoporosis.</p>
<p>I had elective surgery in May called a Laparoscopic Colectomy to remove the disease from my body and was again hospitalized over 2 weeks.  They removed my large intestine, colon, and appendix.  As of now I have an ostomy bag on the right of my stomach that collects waste that I empty between 20-30 times a day as I do not have a colon.  Another surgery is set for a reversal in which the doctors create a pouch called a J-Pouch that acts as my colon and my small intestine is then attached to that pouch and I will the be able to have the function to use the bathroom like a normal person.  Between both surgeries my down time is between 6-8 months.  I have limited medical insurance, but even after my copay and deductible the expense is not managable because I am unable to work until I am fully healed.</p>
<p>Being out of work for so long and having all these accumulated medical expenses has taken a toll not only myself but on my family as well.  My parents have taken majority of responsibility for my expenses over the past few years but can no longer take responsibility .  At the moment my only option will be to file for bankruptcy after this whole process is over which I am trying to avoid. </p>
<p>I have tried every other option but feel as a failure as I have run out of options.  I am only looking for a donation of between $10-$20 at this moment.  This is by no means easy for myself or my family and frankly feel embarrassed even asking for donations from people to make ends meet. </p>
<p>Thank you in advance to anyone who has helped or is willing to help.  Also if you would so kindly share this story with whomever you may think would be able to help it would be appreciated!!  Your gratitude does not go unappreciated and thank you for reading my story!! </p>

<h2>Why Inanna House??</h2>
<p><em><em>When I found Inanna House and felt the sincere wamth and infallible integrity from its founders, I simply knew that there was an answer; a vision I could hold onto for dear life - one that could grant me the courage to fiercely fight to see it built, as it would not only restore my faith, but it would also PREVENT all of us diagnosed with this condition from losing theirs. </em></em></p>
<p><em>My Sincerest Thanks,</em></p>
<p><em>Sarah Lamando</em></p>
<p><strong><a href=""http://www.asliceoflyme.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""A Slice of Lyme"">http://www.asliceoflyme.blogspot.com/</a></strong><em> </em></p>
<h2>Highlights of The Vision for Inanna House</h2>
<p>*The intention of Inanna House is to create<strong><em> numerous</em></strong> centers around the world as millions are in need of help. Here are some highlights of what <em><strong>each</strong></em> of these centers (the first to be built in Sonoma County, California) will provide:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A Retreat Style Center with 24 Private Rooms with Baths for In-patient stay, built on 14-15 Acres of viable land.</strong></li>
</ul><ul>
<li class=""_mce_tagged_br"">
<strong>24 Hour Care and monitoring as patients undergo <em>individualized</em> treatment plans, incorporating <em>all</em> worlds of medicine to acheive optimal re-integration and healing, which would address each aspect of the individual: <em>Mind, Body, and Sprit.</em></strong><strong> </strong>
</li>
</ul><ul>
<li class=""_mce_tagged_br"">
<strong>The Center will incorporate <em>Green Energy</em> to make it as self-sustainable as possible. </strong>(Good for the Environment, and lowers overhead costs, and thus, in turn, patient fees - now, that's what I call a win/win situation : ) </li>
</ul><ul>
<li class=""_mce_tagged_br""><strong><strong>An In-House Organic Garden big enough to feed all residents and provide patients with a necessary ""Clean, Alkaline Diet"" to aid them in their recovery.</strong></strong></li>
</ul><ul>
<li class=""_mce_tagged_br"">
<strong>A $20 Million Dollar Endowment Fund for individuals who can't pay for treatment but desperately need it.</strong> (Not Kidding...)</li>
</ul><ul>
<li class=""_mce_tagged_br"">
<strong>Fees that are on a sliding scale basis, and a ""Give Back"" Program so that those who have received treatment and <em>recovered</em> have the opportunity to come back and help give patients who are currently being treated hope, guidance, and support.</strong> (Trust me, only Lyme Patients would be <em>thrilled</em> to have this opportunity. Why? Because they desperately wish <em>they </em>had someone to guide them through their own battle to recovery.)</li>
</ul><ul>
<li><strong>A Program specifically designed to help care-takers understand <em>exactly</em> what their loved ones are going through, and how Lyme disease and its co-infections are effecting them. This program will also give specific instructions so that care-takers will also know how they can help their loved ones recover. </strong></li>
</ul><p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">* To learn more about what other amazing features and specific therapies the center intends on offering, please visit their website at: </p>

<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<h3><em>The Total Estimated Cost to Keep the Vision For Inanna House Alive for the Next Year is: $73,850...</em></h3>
<h3><em>The LEAST I could do was try and help them get $17,000 as it would literally give them their wings so that they have a fighting start to move ahead with their amazing vision for the next quarter. </em></h3>

<h2>Sounds Amazing! Right? Here's why they just need a little help to get things started...</h2>
<p>The creation of Inanna House has been a labor of love, filled with blessed intention, and people determined to see it through the end. Their integrity and vision will NOT be comprised, and in an effort ensure that, they have been reaching out to the Lyme Community for help with certain aspects pertaining to the legal matters that would help get Inanna House off the ground and running as a Nationwide Non-Profit Organization with blueprints and budget projectories in-hand to present to willing investors. </p>
<p>However, anyone who has Chronic Lyme Disease will tell you that even with the best of intentions and a sincere determination to help, often times their illness simply overcomes them and they are unable to perform the duties they so very much had wanted to.</p>

Why Inanna House??
When I found Inanna House and felt the sincere wamth and infallible integrity from its founders, I simply knew that there was an answer; a vision I could hold onto for dear life - one that could grant me the courage to fiercely fight to see it built, as it would not only restore my faith, but it would also PREVENT all of us diagnosed with this condition from losing theirs. 
My Sincerest Thanks,
Sarah Lamando

Highlights of The Vision for Inanna House
*The intention of Inanna House is to create numerous centers around the world as millions are in need of help. Here are some highlights of what each of these centers (the first to be built in Sonoma County, California) will provide:

A Retreat Style Center with 24 Private Rooms with Baths for In-patient stay, built on 14-15 Acres of viable land.


24 Hour Care and monitoring as patients undergo individualized treatment plans, incorporating all worlds of medicine to acheive optimal re-integration and healing, which would address each aspect of the individual: Mind, Body, and Sprit. 



The Center will incorporate Green Energy to make it as self-sustainable as possible. (Good for the Environment, and lowers overhead costs, and thus, in turn, patient fees - now, that's what I call a win/win situation : ) 

An In-House Organic Garden big enough to feed all residents and provide patients with a necessary ""Clean, Alkaline Diet"" to aid them in their recovery.


A $20 Million Dollar Endowment Fund for individuals who can't pay for treatment but desperately need it. (Not Kidding...)


Fees that are on a sliding scale basis, and a ""Give Back"" Program so that those who have received treatment and recovered have the opportunity to come back and help give patients who are currently being treated hope, guidance, and support. (Trust me, only Lyme Patients would be thrilled to have this opportunity. Why? Because they desperately wish they had someone to guide them through their own battle to recovery.)

A Program specifically designed to help care-takers understand exactly what their loved ones are going through, and how Lyme disease and its co-infections are effecting them. This program will also give specific instructions so that care-takers will also know how they can help their loved ones recover. 
* To learn more about what other amazing features and specific therapies the center intends on offering, please visit their website at: 
http://www.inannahouse.org/our-vision.html
 
The Total Estimated Cost to Keep the Vision For Inanna House Alive for the Next Year is: $73,850...
The LEAST I could do was try and help them get $17,000 as it would literally give them their wings so that they have a fighting start to move ahead with their amazing vision for the next quarter.

However, anyone who has Chronic Lyme Disease will tell you that even with the best of intentions and a sincere determination to help, often times their illness simply overcomes them and they are unable to perform the duties they so very much had wanted to.
In a nutshell, they've had a couple unforseen setbacks, and are in need of monetary contributions to enable them to do the following:

They need to get their logo copyrighted to prevent any kind of fraud or impersonation:
Estimated Cost: $850

Inanna House is considered a non-profit establishment, but not yet a 501(c)(3). To move further in their fundraising endeavors, and to allow for donations of a larger size, they must obtain this. They need to hire an accountant to draw up a budget, and a lawyer to make sure that Inanna House is in compliance with all laws that pertain to becoming a Non-Profit Organization:
Estimated Cost:$3,000


They need to have the blueprints for the vision for their center drawn up and approved, as this will help them in future fundraising endeavors, as well as in presentations to foundations and investors: 

Estimated Cost: $3,000 ***Service Offered**** (Yay : )
Estimated Cost for Presentation Preparation: $5,000



Thus far, ALL of the work that has been put into creating this organization has been lovingly done by either Sara Donnelly or Mara Williams herself. With the expansion of their vision, and more and more people wanting to become involved, it would be impossilble for them to continue their work alone. In order to ensure that every question about this Center is answered, and every future marketing and/or fundraising event is upheld, they desperately need to hire more personnel.



Estimated Cost: $2,000/Month



To expand the awareness of Inanna House and their unique vision, they need to hire a Publicist/Marketer to publicize, organize, and help find connections.



Estimated Cost: $3,000/Month



This Publicist/Marketer will most definitely be in need of marketing material and promotional products from Inanna House:



Estimated Cost: $2,000

The benefits of having this  team is to develop basic and advanced volleyball fundamentals, achieve success, develop an understanding of movement and strategy of the game and accomplishing their goals. Additional benefits from participating in club volleyball are team concepts, conditioning, forward-thinking players who have the tools to excel in volleyball and in life at any level. Our goal is to develop character through an environment that emphasizes earnestness, mutual respect and passion toward volleyball.</p>
<p>The club works to keep cost to a minimum. The fees collected cover things such as insurances, gym space, mailing, equipment, supplies, Arizona Region Fees, coaching compensation, uniforms, spandex and a traveling bag. Realizing that some families may need assistance, there are some fundraisers as an option. It is always the player's choice to do the fundraisers. Any generated fundraiser dollars go towards the reduction of your club fees.</p>
<p>We believe competitiveness; hard work and fun can and should co-exist. Players are encouraged to learn the game of volleyball, compete, and finish the season with a positive view of themselves and the game of volleyball.</p>

The fees collected cover things such as insurances, gym space, mailing, equipment, supplies, Arizona Region Fees, coaching compensation, uniforms, spandex and a traveling bag. Realizing that some families may need assistance, there are some fundraisers as an option. It is always the player's choice to do the fundraisers. Any generated fundraiser dollars go towards the reduction of your club fees.
We believe competitiveness; hard work and fun can and should co-exist. Players are encouraged to learn the game of volleyball, compete, and finish the season with a positive view of themselves and the game of volleyball.

We understand that not everyone can donate to help our team, but we would appreciate it if you would pass this information out to someone who could.

<p>""Viberoll is a product that will revolutionize the market of vibration and rolling. With the accessibility and high-quality build, this will outlast all competitor-like products. Something to get proper myofascial work at home or on the go does not exist in a high-quality form until now with Viberoll."" ~Brad Anderson, Salt Lake City Chiropractic</p>
<p>""Viberoll targets all the tight areas I have been trying to reach with the other, bigger rollers. It is more direct and appleis the right amount of pressure to effectively relieve tension. And its size and weight makes it convenient enough to take anywhere. It is definitely a staple in my fitness regimen. I would recommend it to anyone in the area of physical activity"" ~Andrea, CPT</p>
<p>""In my profession, my hands are my most valuable tools. Diagnostically and therapeutically. I use my hands with every patient/client interaction. Anything that increases the longevity of my ability to perform these manual skills, I consider to be invaluable. VibeRoll is that tool. It allows me to assess and treat the targeted tissue while maintaining ideal biomechanics at my hand, wrist, and arm. There are various other tools out there that practitioners use to help mitigate the stress on their bodies, essentially using the tool as an extension of his/her own body. None do that as well as Viberoll. Every try to do deep tissue work on someone by pushing and rolling a foam roller or lacrosse ball on them? It is nearly impossible, and by the end of the day ,that practitioner has exhausted his/her own body. Viberoll is designed with the practitioner's ergonomics at the forefront - extending the career life or any one who relies on their hands as much as I do.

But current solutions to measure body temperature are either providing episodical results (traditional thermometers) or inaccurate (non-contact scanners).That's why we've developed PouchPASS - an Always-on, Precise, No Charging Required Body Temperature Monitoring System. PouchPASS comes with Mobile App, Data Dashboard, and Free Lifetime Subscription for all Indiegogo backers.Always-on: unlike other solutions - thermometers, forehead scanners that only measure body temperature at checkpoints, PouchPASS gives you continuous measurement throughout the day, allowing you to identify health issues and act faster. Precise: PouchPASS uses MAX30208 – a Clinical grade temperature sensor with up to ± 0.1 °C/°F measurement accuracy.No Charging Required: PouchPASS comes with a CR2032 battery that can last up to three (3) months. The battery is easy to replace.Mobile App: Record your temperature readings in your diary; see historical body temperature data. Available in iOS and Android app stores.Data Dashboard: A killer feature for your business: with the PouchPASS dashboard, you can easily add all the people in your organization, monitor their temperature in realtime, and track contact history.Free Lifetime Subscription: An Exclusive offer for all our backers on Indiegogo.

.    For Families with Kids and Elderly Use CaseBrenda has a large family: besides her husband she has 2 young children and 2 parents that she is taking care of. Recently she has been worried that her loved ones can get sick so she has been constantly trying to protect them. However, her parents live far away and her kids don’t like to sit still at home and often play with their neighbours. Checking that they are healthy has been a big challenge!Brenda bought a family package and gave both her kids and her parents a temperature monitoring wristband. Now Brenda:

It is important for him to make sure that his guests feel safe in his restaurant. He has 12 staff and monitoring their temperature every morning has been slowing down his operations. He is also concerned that the gun thermometer  that he is using might not be as precise since it measures the temperature only at 1 moment in time.Chris bought a Small Business package and provided all his employees with temperature monitoring wristbands. He also bought a gateway not to rely on the employees’ handphones. Now Chris: 
Can monitor seamlessly the temperature of all his employees through a dedicated dashboard accessible through the web
Can also monitor the contact history and see which employees have been in contact over the past 14 days. So in case somebody falls sick he can notify the ones that have been in contact with him to stay at home for a few days.
 Chris also published a PouchPASS widget on his webpage to inform his guests about the fact that all his employees are healthy and is gaining a competitive advantage over his competition by doing so.   Key FeaturesOnline Dashboard & Bluetooth for BusinessesYou have a bigger organization?

<p>When I started this company, I soon realized the market is tough and needed to figure out a way to stand out from the crowd besides the catchy name and logos. Being an inventor, turned CEO, I created a machine for abs that is currently not in the market but the cost of getting it ready for retail was extremely high. Out of frustration I decided to go for a 5mile jog to blow off steam. It was a bit windy out so I tucked in my gym towel underneath the collar of my T-shirt as always. The 5 miles was never completed, instead, I went back home to the drawing board where FiTow was born.</p>

<li>I'm the Founder/CEO of Workout or Walkout, Inc. (<a href=""http://www.workoutorwalkout.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.workoutorwalkout.com</a>) and my goal in life is to leave the world a better place than it was when I came in.</li>
<li>I've worked at other gyms prior to starting my Sporting Goods Company. And yes, I use to pickup towels daily from the treadmill handles and around the gym that people left behind.</li>
<li>I've had experience in almost every position there in various works of life from ground level janitor to management including volunteering.</li>
<li>My consulting CFO has over 30 years experience and currently owns equity in the company so his drive for this to succeed is just as high as mine.</li>
<li>I have great relationship with my manufacturers and they are always willing to go the extra mile if need be.</li>
<li>My work ethics is second to none. Currently, I will out work any employee any given day and always have period.</li>
<li>My drive for success is very personal. Obstacle is my favorite ""energy drink"" besides 5hr energy drink and sometimes coffee...lol.</li>
<li>I love distractions and setbacks because it provides the opportunity to show my true commitment and resolution abilities. Besides, it's part of life so it's a take it or leave it situation from my point of view.</li>

Pick a perk of your choice or show your support through this campaign. Your support for our company is greatly appreciated.


Risks & Challenges
The process is in place right this minute and we do not foresee any delays at this time. If there's anything of concern, we will be sure to update you and keep you posted.
About the Founder
When I started this company, I soon realized the market is tough and needed to figure out a way to stand out from the crowd besides the catchy name and logos. Being an inventor, turned CEO, I created a machine for abs that is currently not in the market but the cost of getting it ready for retail was extremely high. Out of frustration I decided to go for a 5mile jog to blow off steam. It was a bit windy out so I tucked in my gym towel underneath the collar of my T-shirt as always. The 5 miles was never completed, instead, I went back home to the drawing board where FiTow was born.
  

I'm the Founder/CEO of Workout or Walkout, Inc. (www.workoutorwalkout.com) and my goal in life is to leave the world a better place than it was when I came in.
I've worked at other gyms prior to starting my Sporting Goods Company. And yes, I use to pickup towels daily from the treadmill handles and around the gym that people left behind.
I've had experience in almost every position there in various works of life from ground level janitor to management including volunteering.
My consulting CFO has over 30 years experience and currently owns equity in the company so his drive for this to succeed is just as high as mine.
I have great relationship with my manufacturers and they are always willing to go the extra mile if need be.
My work ethics is second to none. Currently, I will out work any employee any given day and always have period.
My drive for success is very personal. Obstacle is my favorite ""energy drink"" besides 5hr energy drink and sometimes coffee...lol.
I love distractions and setbacks because it provides the opportunity to show my true commitment and resolution abilities. Besides, it's part of life so it's a take it or leave it situation from my point of view.

</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Megasus Horserunners are the result of long-standing research and study of horse hooves for twenty years. We found the common understanding of the functioning of the hoof to be wrong.

<p><b>Why are Megasus Horserunners non-permanent?</b></p>
</div>Imagine not cutting your toenail and letting it grow for two months. Besides it being a bit gross, how would it feel if you tried to put on your shoes? Would they still fit? A horse has to stand on that long toenail and carry all its weight. In two months a hoof grows 1-2cm (0,4-0,8”). A permanent hoof protection of 6 to 8 sometimes 12 weeks has a negative influence on tendons and ligaments, causing serious tension in the hoof.</div>

<div>Megasus Horserunners are non-permanent to ensure hooves are kept in the same natural shape throughout the year and allow the horse to walk barefoot to strengthen its hooves, tendons and ligaments. And when it´s time for performance: clip on Megasus Horserunners! We love horses and we care about their health. And we love movement- when horses are poetry in motion.

</div></div>","MEGASUS HORSERUNNERS:
The world’s first clippable runners for horses, using our patent pending Mega Lock Fastener Technology. We have developed brand new hoof protection for horses using cutting edge technology.

Meet the Megasus Horserunners - the world’s first shock absorbing hoof protection that allows all natural hoof movements and works on any type of terrain. Think of these as the first DIY running shoes for horses!
Our patent pending high performance fastener system allows you to easily clip the Megasus Horserunners on and off at maximum convenience for both, horse and owner – without using any nails! FABULOUS! 
 

 

 
  

 

Megasus Horserunners are the first clippable runners for horses, a non-permanent hoof protection that is as easy to put on as it is to take off - just like your running shoes. Without any iron or nails! But that´s not all!

 
Megasus Horserunners are the result of long-standing research and study of horse hooves for twenty years. We found the common understanding of the functioning of the hoof to be wrong. People still think that hooves are rigid and stiff only able to move 1-4mm on a horizontal plane - this is simply not the case. As early as 1998, we proved the existence of vertical hoof movements and published our first study in the renowned science magazine GEO.
 
In a wedge experiment we glued wedges under one heel of horse’s hoof and found out that the hoof could compensate for wedges between 1-2 cm (0,4-0,8”) without any impact on the joint. From here we concluded that the hoof works similar to a joint, compensating uneven grounds. When fixing the hoof with rigid material such as iron, tendons and ligaments will become immobilized - a feeling comparable to wearing a cast. Megasus Horserunners are flexible and allow all 3-dimensional natural hoof movements on any type of terrain. Flexible doesn´t mean soft, as the hoof itself isn´t soft. It means that the hoof protection should only move under the weight of the horse.
 




 
Why are Megasus Horserunners non-permanent?
Imagine not cutting your toenail and letting it grow for two months. Besides it being a bit gross, how would it feel if you tried to put on your shoes? Would they still fit? A horse has to stand on that long toenail and carry all its weight. In two months a hoof grows 1-2cm (0,4-0,8”). A permanent hoof protection of 6 to 8 sometimes 12 weeks has a negative influence on tendons and ligaments, causing serious tension in the hoof.
 
Megasus Horserunners are non-permanent to ensure hooves are kept in the same natural shape throughout the year and allow the horse to walk barefoot to strengthen its hooves, tendons and ligaments. And when it´s time for performance: clip on Megasus Horserunners! We love horses and we care about their health. And we love movement- when horses are poetry in motion. We think that sports and movement keep us and our horses healthy.
 

That´s the reason why we´ve invented a hoof protection for all types of terrain in every gait. To speed on! Megasus Horserunners - keep on moving!   
 


 
 


 

 

 

Lift up your horse’s leg, take a ruler and measure the widest point of the hoof. E.g. if your measured value is 124mm, you will need the Megasus Horserunners in size 130.

Who are we?</b></h3>
<p>
</p><p><u><a href=""http://ukhealthradio.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">UK
Health Radio</a></u>,
or UKHR, for short, is a relatively new Internet radio station –
100% independent and the first of its kind outside
the USA!</p>
<p>
</p><p>As
our name suggests, we are UK-based and we focus primarily on health
and wellness. Because this is an Internet-based medium, our ‘reach’
is global. So it will not surprise you to hear that our programming
is not just national, but international in style. Our commitment is
to world-class excellence, abhorring parochial prejudice or ‘little
Englander’ narrow-mindedness.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UKHR
is a good-information station. It aspires to be real feel-good radio,
extending beyond just physical health and embracing all aspects of
body, mind and spirit, in an honest open-minded manner.</p><h3>Meet the Team:</h3><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FvFVTpCSP6Mg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DvFVTpCSP6Mg&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FvFVTpCSP6Mg%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>

<p>
</p><p>As
you can see from the bar-chart, well over one third of our listeners
are aged between 25 and 34. This is the single biggest group by a
significant margin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If
you do the Math, as the Americans say, you can see that 4 out of 5 of
our listeners are currently under 55.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And
only 4% are past the current retirement age for males.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As
for gender, you can see from the pie chart that while our profile has
a distinct female bias, men are still strongly represented.</p>
<p>
</p><p>24
hours a day, every day, we broadcast programmes primarily for
health-conscious adults, as well as progressive healthcare
professionals. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone
with a computer, a tablet, a smart-phone or a new generation car
radio can tune in to UKHR, any time, anywhere. The potential could
therefore be measured in billions. Being realistic, our audience
could one day be millions!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our
mission is to create a global community of better informed people and
to provide the professionals who serve them with a new forum for
evidence-based ideas on best practice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We
want to provide a platform for important issues to be aired,
worldwide. We want to make a difference on a global scale – however
small. We want to give the world a new voice and a new freedom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Online
and on air, UKHR promotes wellbeing as being far more important than
either great wealth or material possessions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our
website is designed to provide a primary source of the latest ideas
in health and fitness, diet and nutrition, illness prevention and
cure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It
also provides the professional with a platform on which either to
promote or to challenge new ideas. (There is nothing like healthy
debate in order to stimulate progress!)</p>
<p>Our
magazine Health Triangle Magazine  is evidence that we practise what
we preach. It is online only, so no forests are put at risk to
produce it. It goes out to some 250,000 readers every month, without
using any petrol, postage, paper or diesel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We
use both Facebook and Twitter to spread the good news quickly and
cost-effectively.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The
fact that you are reading this indicates that you are already part of
our present to some degree or other. If you would like to play a part
in our future, now is your chance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>You
can help UKHR remain independent and grow even stronger in its
mission to improve the quality of life for listeners on every single
continent.</p><p><br/></p>

UK
Health Radio,
or UKHR, for short, is a relatively new Internet radio station –
100% independent and the first of its kind outside
the USA!

As
our name suggests, we are UK-based and we focus primarily on health
and wellness. Because this is an Internet-based medium, our ‘reach’
is global. So it will not surprise you to hear that our programming
is not just national, but international in style. Our commitment is
to world-class excellence, abhorring parochial prejudice or ‘little
Englander’ narrow-mindedness.

UKHR
is a good-information station. It aspires to be real feel-good radio,
extending beyond just physical health and embracing all aspects of
body, mind and spirit, in an honest open-minded manner.Meet the Team:

Who’s
listening?

As
you can see from the bar-chart, well over one third of our listeners
are aged between 25 and 34. This is the single biggest group by a
significant margin.

If
you do the Math, as the Americans say, you can see that 4 out of 5 of
our listeners are currently under 55.

And
only 4% are past the current retirement age for males.

As
for gender, you can see from the pie chart that while our profile has
a distinct female bias, men are still strongly represented.

24
hours a day, every day, we broadcast programmes primarily for
health-conscious adults, as well as progressive healthcare
professionals. 


Anyone
with a computer, a tablet, a smart-phone or a new generation car
radio can tune in to UKHR, any time, anywhere. The potential could
therefore be measured in billions. Being realistic, our audience
could one day be millions!

Our
mission is to create a global community of better informed people and
to provide the professionals who serve them with a new forum for
evidence-based ideas on best practice.

We
want to provide a platform for important issues to be aired,
worldwide. We want to make a difference on a global scale – however
small. We want to give the world a new voice and a new freedom.

Online
and on air, UKHR promotes wellbeing as being far more important than
either great wealth or material possessions.

Our
website is designed to provide a primary source of the latest ideas
in health and fitness, diet and nutrition, illness prevention and
cure.

It
also provides the professional with a platform on which either to
promote or to challenge new ideas. (There is nothing like healthy
debate in order to stimulate progress!)
Our
magazine Health Triangle Magazine  is evidence that we practise what
we preach. It is online only, so no forests are put at risk to
produce it. It goes out to some 250,000 readers every month, without
using any petrol, postage, paper or diesel.

We
use both Facebook and Twitter to spread the good news quickly and
cost-effectively.

The
fact that you are reading this indicates that you are already part of
our present to some degree or other. If you would like to play a part
in our future, now is your chance!

You
can help UKHR remain independent and grow even stronger in its
mission to improve the quality of life for listeners on every single
continent.



We are aiming to raise at
least £200,000

We need a minimum of £200,000 to cover our operational expenses such as setting up our office and studio for live radio. This will also enable us to do the following:
UKHR
Studio and Premises: Right
now we have the weekly shows, the monthly e-magazine and a great
group of health experts regularly sharing their knowledge experience
and passion. Very soon, we want to produce more of our own original
broadcast-quality material on a daily basis, including live shows. To
do this we need to set up our own new studio. Financial access to the
tools and services is where the mainstream commercial stations
out-gun new independents like UK Health Radio.

Team of
Experts: This
goes hand in hand with the studio and premises and our wish to do
live radio. Live radio gives us more opportunities for interactivity
and bringing groups of experts together in one room. We can then
direct our search for experts in the different fields and it also
means having the premises to conduct radio presenter workshops as not
all experts are radio savvy.

Job
and Training Opportunities: This
also incorporates intern and apprenticeships. Not only the technical
side of actually being able to operate a studio but the nitty gritty
of what it takes to put a show together before going on-air. The
research itself and how much of it is actually needed. Working
together with the experts to pinpointing requested subject matter
received from our listeners and then concentrating the research on
exactly that and therefor improving the quality and relevance of our
content.

<p><b>What am I doing?</b></p>
<p>The real
effort is to make the system consistently safe, inexpensive, reliable, and easy to
use.<span>  For this prototype I have chosen to
use the sun as our energy source and only the sun.  I have decided to use only mechanical devices
to manage the operation.  I have selected
simple proven manufacturing processes and materials to keep the costs low. And for operating the device I desire it to be

important. More consistent pointing leads to better use of solar energy.  (There is a solar electric version of this invention which uses the same sun tracker!)</span></p><p><span></span></p><h2>Reading Stereographic Sun Path Diagrams</h2><table><tbody><tr>

<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i><b>1. What should I bring with me for the workout?</b></i></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Before each session we spray water on your E-fit clothing, therefor an extra undergarment is recomended. Other than that, you find everything you need for the workout here, so all you need is to turn up!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<span><b><i>2.</i> <i>How does a session look like?</i></b><br/><br/></span>
<ul>
<li>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Before your workout we serve you with an isotonic drink to provide vital minerals and vitamins for your session</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will need a special E-fit clothing set, that we provide in our center</p>
</li>
<li>

<li>
<p>Next comes the E-fit west and pants which are to provide impulses for your muscles for a more intense exercise</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Than is your 20 minute personalized workout session</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When your training is over you can choose to have a shower or just simply change back to your clothes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before you leave, we serve you with a protein shake to provide you with nutrions that supports your body</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><i><b>3. Will I get wet during the training?</b></i></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In order to ensure appropriate impulse transfer 
electrode surfaces need to be dampened for good contact between the 
machine and the customer.</p>
<p></p>
<p align=""justify""><i><span><b>4. Do I have to move or exercise during my session?</b></span></i></p>
<p>Yes, you do by performing the exercises suited to your
 capabilities and demonstrated by the fitness instructor. Performing the
 right exercises in line with the rhythm of the impulses significantly 
augments the favorable effects of EMS workout as opposed to exercising 
alone.</p>
<p></p>
<p><i><span><b>5. Who holds the training sessions?</b></span></i></p>
<p>Our training sessions take place with the assistance 
of qualified personal fitness trainers who help you perform the 
exercises correctly and assume the right body posture. They also 
demonstrate and perform the exercises with you, give advice on the right
 dietary regime and naturally, they are forthcoming and polite.</p>
<p></p>
<p><i><span><span><span><span><b>6. Is 2x20 minute workout a week enough?</b></span></span></span></span></i></p>
<p>The weekly amount of workout recommended by E-Fit is 
2x20 minutes. Unless you do other exercises as well, 3 training sessions
 a week are allowed with at least a 48-hour rest period between the 
sessions.</p>
<p></p>
<p align=""justify""><i><span><b>7. What is the difference between E-fit and other muscle stimulators?</b></span></i></p>
<p>Most home use and other muscle stimulators are 
designed to be applied on passive muscles. During E-Fit sessions muscle 
stimulation is applied on active muscles, combined with a sequence of 
trainer-instructed exercises.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><i><span><b>8. Is there a weight loss program within the setting option of the E-fit equipment?</b></span></i></p>
<p>The fat-burning effect does not occur directly. 
Workout intensity increases the metabolic rate and following a proper 
diet will automatically trigger weight loss and muscle toning.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><i><span><b>9. What age group is this type of workout recommended for?</b></span></i></p>
<p>E-Fit training is recommended for everyone, regardless
 of age and gender. We have customers over 50, who can keep perfectly 
fit with the sessions. We also have young mothers who we help with 
rehabilitation after giving birth. There are also several active 
athletes among our clients, who tell us that we help them improve 
performance, increase speed, shape their muscles and enhance dynamics. 
Most people, however, only want to look better and improve their fitness
 - something they can all achieve with us.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><i><span><b>10. Are there any reasons why you should not use E-fit equipment?</b></span></i></p>
<p>The equipment must not be used by people with heart 
disease, pacemakers or other implanted electric devices, during 
pregnancy, with a predisposition to epileptic seizures or fitting.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h4></h4>
<p><i><b>11. Can I get an electric shock during the workout?</b></i></p>
<p>No, there is no way you get an electric shock during 
workout as the equipment operates at low voltage using an external power
 source or battery. The intensity of the generated impulses is max. 0.05
 Watt RMS.</p>
<p></p>
<p><i><span><b>12. To what extent does the E-fit training strain my joints?</b></span></i></p>
<p>The E-FIT training is completely easy on joints.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><i><span><b>13. Can the E-fit equipment be used during pregnancy and breastfeeding?</b></span></i></p>
<p>It is not allowed to be used during pregnancy at all and is not recommended during breastfeeding.</p>
<p></p>
<p><i><span><b>14. What effect will the E-fit equipment have on my skin?</b></span></i></p>
<p>E-Fit training sessions result in tighter skin and can
 effectively combat cellulite. We highly recommend it for young mothers 
who wish to get back into shape after giving birth.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><i><span><b>15. When will I see visible results?</b></span></i></p>
<p>A “striking” change can only be achieved through a 
complex process. A healthy diet combined with 2 to 3 workout sessions 
per week will produce visible changes after 10 occasions.</p>
<p></p>
<p><i><span><b>16. Can I eat immediately before workout?</b></span></i></p>
<p>In order to achieve an optimum workout effect you 
should consume high-carb food 2.5 to 3 hours before the session. You 
should not eat two hours before workout to avoid abdominal discomfort.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><i><b>17. Will my muscles by stiff after the workout?</b></i></p>
<p>Muscle stiffness is the worst after the first workout 
session as E-Fit works on deep muscles that are hard to reach through 
normal training. However this will gradually disappear with regular 
training sessions. Muscle stiffness can last 2 to 3 days after the 
session and persists for a longer time than after a normal workout 
session.</p>
<p></p>
<p><i><span><b>18. Can the impulse depth, frequency and intensity be adjusted during my workout session?</b></span></i></p>
<p>On E-Fit machines the impulse depth, frequency and 
intensity can be adjusted freely to personal needs depending on your 
build, age, gender and level of fitness.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><i><span><b>19. Can the E-fit equipment be used for rehabilitation?</b></span></i></p>
<p>Certainly so, as the technology itself comes from 
physiotherapy. It does not overload joints and so the muscles of an 
injured body part can be developed efficiently.</p>
<p></p>

 a week are allowed with at least a 48-hour rest period between the 
sessions.

7. What is the difference between E-fit and other muscle stimulators?
Most home use and other muscle stimulators are 
designed to be applied on passive muscles. During E-Fit sessions muscle 
stimulation is applied on active muscles, combined with a sequence of 
trainer-instructed exercises.



8. Is there a weight loss program within the setting option of the E-fit equipment?
The fat-burning effect does not occur directly. 
Workout intensity increases the metabolic rate and following a proper 
diet will automatically trigger weight loss and muscle toning.



9. What age group is this type of workout recommended for?
E-Fit training is recommended for everyone, regardless
 of age and gender. We have customers over 50, who can keep perfectly 
fit with the sessions. We also have young mothers who we help with 
rehabilitation after giving birth. There are also several active 
athletes among our clients, who tell us that we help them improve 
performance, increase speed, shape their muscles and enhance dynamics. 
Most people, however, only want to look better and improve their fitness
 - something they can all achieve with us.



10. Are there any reasons why you should not use E-fit equipment?
The equipment must not be used by people with heart 
disease, pacemakers or other implanted electric devices, during 
pregnancy, with a predisposition to epileptic seizures or fitting.



11. Can I get an electric shock during the workout?
No, there is no way you get an electric shock during 
workout as the equipment operates at low voltage using an external power
 source or battery. The intensity of the generated impulses is max. 0.05
 Watt RMS.

12. To what extent does the E-fit training strain my joints?
The E-FIT training is completely easy on joints.



13. Can the E-fit equipment be used during pregnancy and breastfeeding?
It is not allowed to be used during pregnancy at all and is not recommended during breastfeeding.

14. What effect will the E-fit equipment have on my skin?
E-Fit training sessions result in tighter skin and can
 effectively combat cellulite. We highly recommend it for young mothers 
who wish to get back into shape after giving birth.



15. When will I see visible results?
A “striking” change can only be achieved through a 
complex process. A healthy diet combined with 2 to 3 workout sessions 
per week will produce visible changes after 10 occasions.

16. Can I eat immediately before workout?
In order to achieve an optimum workout effect you 
should consume high-carb food 2.5 to 3 hours before the session. You 
should not eat two hours before workout to avoid abdominal discomfort.



17. Will my muscles by stiff after the workout?
Muscle stiffness is the worst after the first workout 
session as E-Fit works on deep muscles that are hard to reach through 
normal training. However this will gradually disappear with regular 
training sessions. Muscle stiffness can last 2 to 3 days after the 
session and persists for a longer time than after a normal workout 
session.

18. Can the impulse depth, frequency and intensity be adjusted during my workout session?
On E-Fit machines the impulse depth, frequency and 
intensity can be adjusted freely to personal needs depending on your 
build, age, gender and level of fitness.



19. Can the E-fit equipment be used for rehabilitation?
Certainly so, as the technology itself comes from 
physiotherapy. It does not overload joints and so the muscles of an 
injured body part can be developed efficiently.",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Mission</h3>
<p><strong>Bust A Move</strong> is an athletics equipment company dedicated to keeping all girls active, regardless of body type. Using mechanical engineering principles, we have designed a supportive, patent-pending sports bra to meet the specific needs of busty athletes. We believe <strong>sports bras are sports equipment™</strong> and that, with the right equipment, girls can tackle any challenge and face any competitor with comfort and confidence.</p>
<p><strong>Help us cross the finish line to production with a contribution today! </strong>Click ""Back It"" or select a Perk to support busty athletes and Bust A Move. </p>
<h3>Our Problem</h3>
<p>Studies show that over 50% of girls drop out of sports by the age of seventeen, and one major reason for this is breast development. The UK Journal of Adolescent Health found that <strong>73% of busty girls cite their breasts as a deterrent to exercise</strong>. Yet major brands fail to build products specifically for busty athletes. They design sports bras with the industry standard of B cup, even while the average bra size in the United States is DD. As a result, busty athletes often wear two, three, even six sports bras at a time to create the support they need to perform.</p>
<h3>Our Solution</h3>
<p>Bust A Move's bra is designed by a <strong>busty athlete-engineer</strong> who prioritizes function over fashion.  We believe sports bras are sports equipment™ as opposed to intimates or underwear. Sports bras are as essential to an athlete as cleats or shin guards. Our <strong>patent-pending design</strong> minimizes the Moment of Inertia, which is the resistance to a change in motion. With more Inertia, there is more breast bouncing and, therefore, more pain for the athlete. Our sports bra design also addresses several other problems that our target users have, including stress on the neck and difficulty putting bras on and off. We’ve engineered our sports bra to solve multiple problems in one, easy-to-use, accessible product. </p>
<p>The Bust A Move sports bra has three key features designed to minimize inertia. </p>
<p><strong>Adjustable Band:</strong> Support starts from the bottom up with our adjustable band, which takes some of the strain off the shoulders and reduces total displacement. </p>
<p><strong>Encapsulation Layer:</strong> While the outer layer compresses the breasts, the inner encapsulation layer redistributes the weight across the chest to prevent cleavage and side-to-side movement. </p>
<p><strong>Dispersive Straps</strong>: We added dispersive straps to the bra’s traditional racerback design to increase its surface area on the shoulders, which in turn decreases back and neck tension. </p>

<p><b>Q: Do I need the Internet access to use Accutension?</b></p>
<p>A: No internet access is needed for a measurement, but if you want to send the measurement data to others, internet access is needed.</p>
<p><b>Q: Does Accutension work with all types of automatic blood pressure monitors?</b></p>
<p>A: Majority of the upper arm BPMs. More specifically: 1. upper arm cuff, and 2. cuff deflation takes longer time than inflation.</p>
<p><b>Q: Should I always use Accutension, if I have a BPM, or just when I am worried about the readings?</b></p>
<p>A: At first, you can compare the reading between your BPM and accutension for several times. If the reading is always very close, you don't need to use accutension for checking purpose everyday. But Accutension has other features such as store your readings on your phone. Since Accutension is easy to use, you can use it everyday for better blood pressure management.</p>
<p><b>Q: If I have an Automatic BPM, which option should I select?</b></p>
<p>A: You can select either Accutension Stetho or Accutension Classic, depending on the purpose. Accutension can check the algorithm, which is the major source of inaccuracy. Accutension can check both the algorithm and the pressure sensor, so you can have higher confidence on the reading.</p>
<p><b>Q: Do I need to have a medical expertise to use Accutension at home?</b></p>
<p>A: No. Accutension is designed to simplify the measurement difficulties. In case you follow the process, it is not difficult to get accurate readings.</p>
<p><b>Q: Is the battery re-chargeable?</b></p>
<p>A: Yes. The battery is re-chargeable, so you don't need to worry about running out of power. Just re-charge it.</p>
<p><b>Q: There are other phone connected BPMs such as Withings and iHealth. How is Accutension different from them?</b></p>
<p>A: 1. the measurement method is different. Both Withings and iHealth use oscillometric method, but Accutension use auscultatory method. In case you are interested in some accuracy research on them, here is a link: <a href=""http://www.ashjournal.com/article/S1933-1711(14)00235-6/pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.ashjournal.com/article/S1933-1711(14)00235-6/pdf</a>. 2. the role of the phone is different. Accutension uses the phone to listen so the phone ""measures"" the blood pressure, but others mainly use the phone to ""store"" the result.</p>
<p><b>Q: Most automatic BPM states their accuracy in the spec and the accuracy is 3-4 mmHg. Is it true?</b></p>
<p>A: That accuracy is for the pressure sensor. The pressure sensor just get the pressure of the cuff. The algorithm estimates the blood pressure. So the error of blood pressure is mainly from the algorithm. That number as blood pressure monitor accuracy is misleading.</p>
<p><b>Q: Most automatic BPMs claim that they passed certain Accuracy Validation Protocol and they are accurate. Is it true?</b></p> <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">A: There are three leading Accuracy validation protocols in the world. These protocols can guarantee the device is relative accurate for a percentage of population (around 60% if 5 mmHg is accuracy criterion). They can't guarantee the device is accurate for a specific user. Some person even got an error bigger than 50 mmHg. Such kind of protocol is designed by the industry to let some auto BPMs to be able to pass, so that they can sell. With Accutension, everybody can check the device accuracy by himself, so protocol is not needed any more.</span><div> <div><div>

We were interviewed by Maker Paradise. Click here to listen to the podcast.
Almost 1,000 Americans die DAILY from causes related to high blood pressure. Two thirds of adults have blood pressure higher than normal. Monitoring and forecasting potential problems is critical for your well being and can even save lives of your loved ones.
Unfortunately, you can’t rely on your automatic BPM. 
Several years ago, my friend was misdiagnosed because of inaccurate reading. Shockingly, his experience is not unique (just check multiple complains on Amazon.com about blood pressure monitors).
If you or your loved one are using automatic blood pressure monitors (BPM), you may be misled by their readings. Most  BPMs employ their own algorithms and use cuff pressure oscillation for the estimates. As a result, a user gets different readings, depending on the monitor they are using. Approximately 40% of the users have shown discrepancy in the recent study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It may lead to inappropriate treatments or a lack of them, putting millions of people in danger of  fatal strokes, myocardial infarctions or exposing them to adverse drug and psychological effects, and unnecessary expenses. Think about your parents. They have taken care of you all your life. Now, it’s your time to support them. Accuracy of their medical devices is crucial as never before.Accutension is the first blood pressure kit for at home use that provides the results as accurate as doctor’s measurements, employing your smartphone and an app.

Doctors directly determine the blood pressure by listening (auscultating) to the sounds of blood flow. So does Accutension: it provides readings based directly on the sounds, not algorithms, resulting in accurate, consistent, and reliable blood pressure measurement.
 

Accutension works with your  traditional sphygmomanometer or an automatic BPM or as an independent blood pressure kit with its own cuff. 
The sounds from the tube of the stethoscope are fed into the phone through a microphone plugged into the jack. 

You can use Accutension to verify your BPM’s readings. It will provide a simultaneous second reading on a smartphone from the same device.

 

 
If you just want to check the algorithm, Accutension Stetho is for you. The process is as easy as recording a video on your phone (no app needed).
Plug the Stetho into your phone and record the video (shoot the display of the BPM) during the blood pressure measurement. The sounds of blood flow (Korotkoff sounds) will be recorded.

Then, replay the video and listen to the sounds. When you hear the first Korotkoff sound, the number on the screen is the systolic pressure; when the Korotkoff sounds disappear, the number on the screen is the diastolic pressure. Compare these results with those on your BPM screen.  
 
The Accutension Stetho just checks the algorithm. With Accutension Classic, you can check both the algorithm and the pressure sensor of the BPM. 
Plug the pressure sensor module into any upper arm BPM with a tube connecting the cuff and the machine. There is a connector between the tube and the machine body which is easy to take off in order to add the Accutension module. The sensor does not affect the normal BMP operation, so you don’t need to unplug it. 

The same way, you can check the accuracy of your sphygmomanometer. 

Use the Accutension App to simplify and attest the accuracy of the readings.


If you add a cuff and a hand pump to Accutension Classic, it becomes a standalone blood pressure kit.
Selecting a correct cuff size is very important for accurate blood pressure measurement. We will provide two cuffs of different sizes in every kit, to make sure you get the one most suitable for your arm.
The cuff will be self deflated at a speed 2-4 mmHg/s, required by accurate blood pressure measurement guideline. 

 
 
With Accutension Doc, you can easily conduct a research on the blood pressure measurement. The accessories will allow you to connect two stethoscopes together with Accutension Stetho or connect the Accutension pressure sensor module, a traditional sphygmomanometer and an automatic BPM together.
