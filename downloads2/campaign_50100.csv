<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>It is no accident that we, in our time, have been called to tell this story. Our generation is the first to have the tools in place to connect to the entire world. With a post, a click, a tweet - we have the attention of people around the globe. What we have seen, even in our limited outreach so far, is that Sacajawea has an impact on hearts, and it is astounding.  She was a 12-year old Shoshone girl, but we still remember her. Many have wondered what happened in her life - it is a journey yet <i>UNTOLD </i>in a feature film.</p>
<p>We have been called for many years to tell this story. It is an enormous project and it will take a global awareness. <span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">So here we are as a creative team, lifted to new heights and on the brink of bringing this magnificent and powerful film to fruition. What we know, it is the Spiritual energy, the infinite vibration and the transparent awakening of hearts that ignites this production! People from all walks of life have commented and left messages of support and love on our social media outlets. Many have asked, “What can I do?"" ""How can I get involved?”</span></p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Over this last year, we have made great strides toward producing Sacajawea's film. In fact, we have the pieces in place to pursue our final push to major investors. This moment in time is critical to meeting our production goals. And, we also see a dynamic opportunity for you to help us over the next couple of months.</p>
<p>Your contribution will give us the support we need to expand our promotional efforts on social media, our websites and blogs by partnering with a social media marketing firm. From Facebook to LinkedIn, Instagram to Twitter, we want to spread the word about this life-changing, epic film project. </p>
<p>In addition, the Warrior Woman Spirit Campaign is a vital part of Sacajawea's story, as it brings awareness to women's issues. We can never forget the lost, stolen, abused and murdered Indigenous women from around the world. We want to use these crowdfunding contributions to connect and invite influential women on a ""Grand Scale,"" to inspire everyone by posting their stories on the warrior woman website.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">We know that achieving the goal is only possible when we realize and recognize the ""value of the journey.” For the journey itself is the teacher, and in order to share the true story of Sacajawea, the lessons of Belief and Gratitude must be embraced.

<p>Warrior Woman Spirit and Sacajawea, The Windcatcher T-shirts, mugs and hats. We also offer totes, posters, flyers, collectible mugs, card sets, jewelry and inspiration.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>How can we connect to the entire world? It is no accident that Sacajawea's spirit has chosen this time to claim her voice. Social media and website/blog outreach is the most important element to bring the awareness she needs. Even with the small amount of posting through friends and family to date, a miraculous wonder has taken place over the years. People from nearly every continent have been moved to contact us from Italy and Brazil, from The Netherlands and Australia, from Norway and the United Kingdom, from Ireland and the Middle East, on and on... with a love for this little, Shoshone girl who stood on the edge of chaos in 1805. Somehow her sweet energy continues to infiltrate the earth!</p>
<p>You can help us share this magical journey with the hearts of people everywhere. Indeed, it is time to awaken the world to the story of Sacajawea! This is her destiny. This is our Calling. And, because you are reading this, you are part of this movement right now!</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The popularity of social media, websites and blogs, and the way the Internet works to connect with people everywhere within a short period of time gives true credibility to what we plan to do through this campaign. It will only be successful if we have the staff to maintain our posting schedules and marketing goals. We are committed to whatever it takes and we stand behind our Internet experience and lifetime devotion to Sacajawea, her spirit, her story and this production. Our focus is on this project and bringing Sacajawea's story to film and we will make every effort to do that, though it is not guaranteed quite yet.  *Local showings and Red Carpet events have not been selected as yet. All ticket perks will be issued only when/if the film is completed. With your help, we can get there!</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand some people cannot contribute to this campaign, but sharing our posts, visiting our websites, reading our blogs, submitting a story for the Warrior Woman Spirit blog,  commenting and lifting us up with your inspiration is valued beyond words. With these contributions in full force, you will also have more tools to give Sacajawea a voice!</p>

<p>My name is Justin Neiswander, and I have had a burning passion for the art of film since middle school. Since then I've made several short films, including ""Neighbour"", ""Guinea Pig,"" and ""Parasite,"" starring Oliver Horsfall (Amazon Prime's <i>Carnival Row.)  </i>I am now in my final year at Prague Film School and am looking for funds for my final/diploma project. The script for ""Apology Accepted"" is still in development and more details about the plot will be revealed in time, yet I can easily say I've never been more excited to make any film than this one. I'm pouring my heart out into this story, and the final product will definitely be my best film yet. </p>
</div><div><p>As you may know, film production is quite costly even on a small, independent level. ""Parasite"" is twelve minutes long and only features three characters and two locations, yet it ended up costing about $1000 to make. Since ""Apology Accepted"" is so much longer and larger in scale, I am hoping to raise $5000 for the project. Every dollar of this 5000 will go towards hiring actors, securing locations, renting equipment, catering for the cast and crew, and various other production expenses necessary for making this the best film it can possibly be. Donating to the project will not only mean the world to me and the pursuit of my passion, but it will also provide you with various perks, including the opportunity to have a character in the film named after you and exclusive access to ""Parasite,"" which has not been released to the public. </p></div><div>
<p>This is my final student film before I enter the professional industry. My goal is to make it so that when I do, I will have a film worthy of distributing, submitting to festivals, and getting my name out there. By donating to this campaign and spreading the word, you will be providing me the means necessary to make that possible. Even if what you can spare does not seem like a significant amount, every cent will help me pursue what I know I was put on this Earth to do. </p>
<p>Thank you all so much, and God bless you. </p>

In the past couple of years, my experiences with people from different nationalities, cultures, and paths trying to get by in the United States, halfway across the world from their families has fascinated me.  It motivated me to learn more about them, and my observations made me realize that a shiny cover of success seemed to always mask the rougher, darker interior of sacrifice, struggle, and loneliness that almost every immigrant experiences for a better life. The complexities of weighing the good and bad of living in a diaspora can weigh someone down - and while the traditional image of success in the land of promise is what most sell, I felt the need to depict the opposite side of this on screen.</p><p> </p><p>Distant is therefore a film that aims to exemplify the lesser known side of an immigrant's life.

In the past couple of years, my experiences with people from different nationalities, cultures, and paths trying to get by in the United States, halfway across the world from their families has fascinated me.  It motivated me to learn more about them, and my observations made me realize that a shiny cover of success seemed to always mask the rougher, darker interior of sacrifice, struggle, and loneliness that almost every immigrant experiences for a better life. The complexities of weighing the good and bad of living in a diaspora can weigh someone down - and while the traditional image of success in the land of promise is what most sell, I felt the need to depict the opposite side of this on screen. Distant is therefore a film that aims to exemplify the lesser known side of an immigrant's life. The film revolves around Richie, a misfit illegal immigrant living a marginal life, as he forced to choose between a surreal love affair and a dying mother back home, as he fights through life in America. Set in two contrasting visual styles to mirror the state of mind of the protagonist, with teals and cyans imitating the feeling of isolation in America, and dull shaded of brown and red representing the helpless and deprived state of Richie's mother in India. Distant is a film that aims to represent immigrants from across the world in the land of opportunities as they pursue the American dream. It is a film that strives to give hope and keep faith in immigrant's hearts - that they are not alone, that their struggle can be seen, and their voice can be heard, loud and clear. Below, we have provided a detailed pie chart with the allocation of the asked funds, for complete transparency with our backers! BREAKING DOWN OUR TARGET AMOUNT OF $10,000  Since we were on the topic of transparency, and trust - here's a little more on the film's incredibly talented crew!  OUR TEAM Each of us represents different cultures, coming from different countries we are bringing the diverse understanding of the craft of filmmaking onto one creative table to collaborate and stand as a whole for what this project believes in.

<h2>What is Signal to Noise?</h2>
<p><strong><i>Signal to Noise</i> is an independent feature film written and directed by Tyler Milles, set to shoot out of Santa Cruz, California in the summer of 2019. Let’s call it a stoner bromance romance with a magical-realist twist.</strong></p>
<p>It follows a stoner whose hazy, solitary life is interrupted by the arrival of an old friend who claims to have gained the ability to experience the dreams of those he sleeps near.</p>
<p>Aiming to test the limits of this bizarre, new ability, they decide to run an experiment. And as they dream together night-after-night, a passion blurring the lines between friendship and romance awakens.</p>

<h2>Who's making it?</h2>
<h3><strong>Tyler Milles - Writer / Director / Cinematographer / Editor</strong></h3>
<p>When I graduated from UC Berkeley’s film studies program, I started calling myself an indie filmmaker. Sure, I had yet to make anything more than a couple shorts, but I wanted to make my intentions clear. No matter what job I took, that was my headline. Whatever money I made was getting dumped into building a filmmaking rig so that if need be, I could take a movie from pre-to-post-production. For as long as I’ve had access to a camera, I’ve been writing, shooting, and editing stuff. And now, with the help of one of my oldest friends whom I’ve been making things with since I met him, I have the chance to make my first feature and I couldn’t be more thrilled.</p>
<h3><strong>Adam Frey - Producer / Assistant Camera</strong></h3>
<p>Growing up just outside of Los Angeles, I've always had a distinct love of movies. Ever since elementary school, when my dad let me use his camera and gave me a copy of Final Cut Express, I've been making short films with my friends. After high school, I got a degree in Economics from Chapman University, hoping that I could combine my knowledge of business and economics with my love of film in order to produce the sort of movie that Hollywood wouldn't normally take a chance on. And now, with <i>Signal to Noise</i>, I have the opportunity to do just that.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553543598/r2cgtffpxv9t1mk2xve1.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>Cristian Caridad - ""Vince Santos""</strong></h3>
<p>When I was young, I would always get sucked in to watching my favorite movies over and over again. And once I got bored of that, I found myself starting to re-enact scenes from those movies myself. A personal favorite was that scene in <i>Jurassic Park </i>when Sam Neil first sees the brachiosaurus. As I grew older and started to pursue acting professionally, I realized that my passion for acting also applied to the rest of the filmmaking process. I wanted to learn how to be behind and in front of the camera. Being able to work on an indie film like this<i><i> </i></i>gives me opportunity to take on all of my passions at once. I'm very proud to take on the role of Vince and can't wait to share <i>Signal to Noise</i> with you.</p>
<h3><strong>Nico Yasko - ""Henry Marquez""</strong></h3>
<p>Since Henry and I are both Latinos and members of the LGBTQ+ community, telling his story is something I'm incredibly passionate about. While I am from Uruguay, I was born in Japan and have lived in places like Conakry, Bangkok, Montevideo, and Grenoble. It's safe to say I was raised all over the world. Right now, I'm studying acting at UCLA's School of Theater, Film, and Television and plan on working on <i>Signal to Noise</i> between quarters. I hope you enjoy what we're all about to make!</p>

<h3>Eden Bailey - Producer / Assistant Director</h3>
<p>Eden is a filmmaker from Surf City, California. He is currently finishing up his bachelor's degree in film direction at Chapman University, and has several short films to his name. Non-film related interests include music, bowling, and just a good round of laser tag.</p>
<h3>Matt Somogyi - Sound Mixer / Sound Designer</h3>
<p>Matt was born in Burbank, CA and has always been interested and infatuated with film, having been surrounded by the entertainment industry and various studios throughout his childhood. After becoming intensely involved in his high school’s media program, Matt went on to receive his B.F.A. in film production from Dodge College at Chapman University with an emphasis in directing, as well as his M.A. in film studies in an accelerated graduate program. Since graduating, he has been fortunate enough to direct a few commercials and short films but primarily makes his living doing production sound and post-production sound mixing. Matt is incredibly excited to be a creative member of Signal to Noise and looks forward to all of the coming adventures with the cast and crew!</p>

<h2>What do we have?</h2>
<h3><strong>Equipment</strong></h3>
<p>Nearly all of the necessary camera and sound equipment is accounted for by my personal rig. We will be shooting the film primarily on a Panasonic GH5s with another Panasonic GH4 backing it up. Post-production equipment is also accounted for here as I've built a computer expressly for that purpose. You can see my equipment in action in our pitch video in addition to the two last shorts I made<strong> <a href=""https://vimeo.com/224596907"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Now What?</i></a> </strong>and<strong> <a href=""https://vimeo.com/168540532"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>A Day in the Life of the Passenger</i></a></strong>.</p>
<h3><strong>Microbudget Experience</strong></h3>
<p>Everything we've made before has been made on a budget of zero dollars with incredibly tight shooting schedules (and I'd like to think it doesn't show). We know how to make the most out of limited resources, which is why we're asking only for what we absolutely need. </p>
<p>From its conception, <i>Signal to Noise </i>was intended to be shot on a microbudget. This isn't a story that got hemmed in to be made cheaply. Every aspect of the script, from its limited number of locations, to its two-hander structure, to the fact that the dreams are only talked about rather than depicted, was designed with a small-scale production in mind.</p>

<h3><b>...wages,</b></h3>
<p>I’m not interested in anyone involved in this film (me and Adam excluded) working for free. This is my highest priority. The cast and crew should be paid for each day that they work. “Exposure,” especially for a film of this small a scale is not enough.</p>

<p>People need fuel to perform and I’d rather the cast and crew did not need to pack their own lunches for a 13 day shoot.</p>
<h3><b>...locations and housing.</b></h3>
<p>There are a limited number of locations featured in the film, the most important of which is the studio apartment where the majority of the film takes place. These private locations will need to be rented. Additionally, because the shoot will be based in Santa Cruz, the majority of the cast and crew will need to be housed for length of the shoot.</p>

<h3>The Tribe Story</h3>
<p>Tribes tells the story of Ronin, a wanderer in the desolate aftermath of a cataclysmic event. His journey has no beginning and no end but it does have some twists and a great payoff. With a subtle nod to todays xenophobic times this action/adventure film takes after films such as Mad Max and I am Legend, however with its own style.</p>
<p>Our past films have dealt with the topics that move us. ""Vemana"" was an award winning experimental/fantasy film that dealt with the oneness of all people. ""Blue Skies"" was another award winning film about the topic of addiction and its devastating effects on relationships. Our last project ""Sickness"" was a sci-fi film and concerned one mans experience with a world on the cusp of environmental ruin.  It premiered at <a href=""http://www.saiff.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SAIFF</a> as part of the HBO Short Film Competition in December. </p>
<p>This project deals with complicated issues such as gender dynamics and exploitation in a world with few rules and fewer institutions.  It is far from a polemic however and we never lose sight of what a good film has to be - entertaining!  Incorporating fight choreography and beautiful locations as well as talented FX artists this will be our most ambitious project to date. We thank you for taking the time to read our campaign. </p>
<p>My wife Chelsea &amp; I have been funding our own films simply because it is our passion. This time we wanted to give others the opportunity to produce with us.  Our topics are socially relevant and our message comes from the heart.  Not only will you help create the narrative that shapes our world, be a part of an entertaining art form, but you will also be immortalized forever in our IMDB page as a producer or contributor! </p>
<p>For example my work is listed <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6786064/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HERE. </a> </p>
<h3>Theme, Tech and Synopsis</h3>
<div>
<div>Tribe deals with dark issues such as predation by the strong upon the weak, sexual exploitation, greed, sadism and does this by using the foil of love, heroism and sacrifice. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>As Ronin wanders the wasteland on a mysterious mission he is captured by suspicious and territorial survivors.  Recounting his desire to be reunited with his lost wife only amuses the hardened group.  As he delves deeper into his past and we learn more about how this particular ""Tribe"" operates we find reflections of our current tribalism.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>In a land where might makes right can someone with humanity survive?  If so... how?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This film uses top notch talent for practical FX (Gene Mazza), costume design (Chelsea Roth) and is blessed with fight choreography by Dr. Kacem Zoughari!  Using the latest professional broadcast quality equipment gives us a 4K UHD, 10 bit, 4:2:2 workflow!  </div>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Who is this guy?</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Jesse Sanchez and I'm writing and directing Koreatown. After spending a few years trying to produce this story out of pocket it has become apparent that the best way to make this idea so that it meets its full potential is by crowd funding. I've been passionate about filmmaking since I was in my early teens, making a feature when I was 16, and then studying  filmmaking at USC. After freelancing as an editor and DIT through my 20's I realized it was time to write an idea that was something I could make in my own neighborhood without a lot of money. Then the recession hit. As I rewrote the script I found that to really meet the full potential of the premise I would need do more than just shoot three guys tripping in an apartment with a cop for 90 minutes. At the same time I was witnessing the slow creep of gentrification all around me, rising like a crescendo until it was obvious that that would need to be part of the movie.</p>
<p>Recently things have been changing so rapidly that it became apparent that I couldn't keep up with changing face of the neighborhood and if I wanted to capture it for what it was I would need help. This campaign represents a chance for me apply and the talent and experience I have had and truly make something unique and entertaining, while also socially relevant. It is a culmination of all the things I have learned about filmmaking, a love letter to the community I've spent 10+ years living and learning in, and a chance to make something entertaining with a diverse world view that doesn't ring false like some college brochure photoshoot. Anyone who's ever met me knows I've trained my brain to be a movie machine and it's time put that machine to work. To make dreams a reality.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How big are these dreams, exactly?</h3>
<p>The scale of the movie is entirely dependent on what I can raise via this campaign. Whether it be a short film, a feature length movie, or a feature with great tripping visuals and killer soundtrack all comes down to who believe in me and this idea.</p>
<p>Growing up watching Indies in the 90's I was always thrown off by how under populated the worlds of those movies felt. I want this movie to be teeming with life the same way the real streets of Koreatown are, where overheard conversations and multiple languages are part of the background noise. When I say I want a densely diverse film I mean it, I want as many languages and ethnicities represented as possible.</p>
<p>Some of the perks in the campaign include featured extra and single line parts. Overhearing out of context bits of conversation while walking around the neighborhood is exactly the kind of comedy I want this movie to be, especially when those lines are in different languages so that, depending on how multilingual you are, each person experiencing the movie will hear different things in it.</p>
<p>If the campaign falls short of the goal the funds raised will be used to complete the short version that I've been self financing for the last few years, completing a few more days of shooting, paying for the sound mix and color correction and if there's anything left after that using the remainder to pay for application fees to various film festivals. Regardless of how it goes the movie is getting made in one form or another.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When I was editing the short and noticing the changes to buildings and other details in the background (because shoot days were always months if not a year apart) I realized just how quickly the neighborhood was changing. In the same way the the original 'She's Gotta Have It' is a time capsule of the what 80's Brooklyn looked like I want to the same to be true for Koreatown. Los Angeles is very much about the new and part of the fun of living there was seeing old movies shot there and how things used to look.</p>
<p>In Boots Riley's 'Sorry to Bother You' he managed to shoot the Oakland he knew while also covering themes of labor organizing/exploitation and code switching, I'd like to do the same for Koreatown while looking at the LA housing crisis, community and bad allies. I think these are worthy topics and that movies have a way of speaking to us as people that no other medium can, a way of seeping into our subconscious the same way dreams do. </p>
</div><div> </div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Any kind of film making is a challenge: time, resources and the unforeseen come with the territory. This is also the stuff that 'happy accidents' are made of-which if you've ever been on a film set is one of the true joys of the filmmaking process.</p>
<p>Since I have already shot a few days with the cast and crew making the short I know our collective strengths and weaknesses. Shooting with permits and proper equipment will make all the difference. If you think the stills and shots from look good just wait until you see what we can do with some real backing this time.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>Something that isn't common knowledge about these crowd funding campaigns is that the number of backers participating can be just as, if not more important, than the total funds raised. You may not have much spare income, but people that do will see those small contributions as an acknowledgment that there is a demand for this idea. Even as a little a $1 helps, because every backer matters. Beyond that, the standard like/share/subscribe also contributes to the numbers that will ultimately define how important this project will be seen by other investors and micro-budget studios. Every little bit helps.</div></div>","Who is this guy?

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>We are a group of second year Media Production: Film and Television students from York St John University.</p>
<p>A mother, broken and defeated, searches her son Andrew’s room for signs of where it all went wrong. She repeatedly plays the news report of her son’s tragic acts on a tape recorder, listening again and again how he committed the murders of ten of his peers at his school earlier that day.</p>
<p>She thinks back to memories where he had shown disapproving behaviour. It was all starting to make sense, she begins to believe it was her fault. She resorts to filming a video explaining her side of the story and apologising for her son’s actions. She decides that she is just as much to blame as her son so plans to take her own life.</p>
<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>
<p>We want this production to highlight how much one event, such as a school stabbing, can affect so many lives, not just those of the victims. In particular, we want to emphasize how a mother feels when her only son is taken from her and how she can only blame herself.</p>
<p>In the last year, the number of teenage and young adult stabbings has reached its highest level in 8 years, according to The Guardian. Because of this we wanted to raise awareness of knife crime in this country and hopefully increase prevention of such attacks. We want this film to be hard-hitting yet grounded and resonate with our audience.  </p>
<p><strong>Please Donate!</strong></p>
<p>We are hoping to raise around £500 in this campaign. This will be spent on travel expenses for the cast and crew, catering on set, props, costumes and anything else we might need.

Motivation
We want this production to highlight how much one event, such as a school stabbing, can affect so many lives, not just those of the victims. In particular, we want to emphasize how a mother feels when her only son is taken from her and how she can only blame herself.
In the last year, the number of teenage and young adult stabbings has reached its highest level in 8 years, according to The Guardian. Because of this we wanted to raise awareness of knife crime in this country and hopefully increase prevention of such attacks. We want this film to be hard-hitting yet grounded and resonate with our audience.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>New York City is lively and dynamic but have you noticed an overwhelming amount of ""For Rent"" signs and empty storefronts in Manhattan lately? Well, we have too. The Tiny Apple takes a look at the disappearing face of New York's small businesses by profiling them and the people who run them. Through their personal anecdotes and experiences these small business owners provide a unique and rare look at the cultural and socioeconomic shift NYC has been undergoing. It's heartbreaking how most of these people, if not all, are struggling to keep their doors open. </p>
<p>Local businesses filled with personality and history are quickly being replaced by big corporations and we hope to capture a vestige of how it used to be before it's completely gone.</p>

But it will be even worse in the future. The number of people developing Alzheimer's is increasing.Chances are that even if you don’t get the disease, you will know someone who has it. And chances are that you will end up caring for someone with the disease.This is what happened to me.Five years ago, I was living in Los Angeles when I received a call that my mother, Love, had wandered away from home. I made the monumental decision to leave my life in LA to move across the country to my childhood home in New Jersey to care her. With no previous caregiving experience, I was confronted with the grim reality of what it actually means to be the caregiver of someone with dementia in the USA.Every person suffering from Alzheimer’s needs at least one person to take on the responsibility for their well-being, but too often that person’s sacrifice is under-rated or taken for granted.  Alzheimer’s is the sixth leading cause of death in the USA. It is the only disease among the top ten killers without any treatment or cure.But we are not without hope.I know now what I did not know then: that what matters is having the best life possible in the present. Because we don’t have the past or the future. We just have now. We are making this film because we want to affect change. Love (yes, that is her real name) was a nurse. Her whole life was dedicated to helping others. She would not have wanted her suffering to be in vain. She would be so proud to know that because of her, other peoples’ lives were made better. There is no cure and no treatment YET for Alzheimer’s disease. Someday there will be. But in the meantime, there is so much that we can do to improve the lives of those suffering from dementia as well as their caregivers.I am a storyteller and a filmmaker. With this film, SHELTERING LOVE, my goal is to bring awareness to the plight of the caregiver, and to offer hope that even though a cure does not currently exist, there is much that can improve the lives of everyone affected by the disease—patients and caregivers alike. SHELTERING LOVE is one family’s story of finding courage, hope—even joy—while facing this devastating disease.By donating today, the future you might be changing could very easily be your own. How does Norway fit into the story?Our team is planning to travel to Norway in November 2018 for filming.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Movie... Naked If Want To  is a true story about Jim McGuire who went from being a Hippie at the ""Summer of Love"" in San Francisco to a combat infantry sergeant on the DMZ in Korea.   The movie tells about combat, more importantly is also tells the story of a young man who did not care about anything or anyone learning importance of love, compassion and courage in the performance of his duties.</p>
<p>The movie also explains by  including recently declassified information the geo-political triumph of the Korean and Vietnam wars and how the service of the men and women who participated changed the word forever.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have a producer.  The funds will be used for attaching a director who has already approved the project, produce the final production screenplay and hire a casting director to begin the process of casting the movie. Once that is done this project will be financed like any other film for distribution. The total for those items including legal fees and travel should be approximately 75 to ideally 125 thousand.  Once that is done the film  will be budgeted and begin the process of producing a film  The producer has done over 60 movies.</p>
<p>Perks will include tickets to the premier, opportunities to apply first to work on the film, signed copies of the screenplay(digital) and of course a thank you letter from the producer of the film.</p>
<p><strong><i>The Impact</i></strong></p>
<p>This story was written by two disabled veteran's of Vietnam and Korea and discloses new information that the writers  feel will not only tell the cost in human terms but the effect those two wars had on the world as we know it today.</p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenge</strong></p>
<p>The film like any movie might not be completed and/or once completed released as planed.  The producer estimated the risk of either of those events was less than ten percent.</p>
<p>We have many experienced people in the entertainment field that have experience to solve most problems that arise  the production process.</p>

<p>I am writing to you on behalf of the creative team at Curesa O-Eight Productions, a black owned and woman led organization, that is working to Tell Stories that NEED To Be Told! Our current project presents an opportunity to tell a story of the often-overlooked marginalized groups in America and the importance of mental health in the community.<br/>The Project: Is about three sisters that are bound together by a dark secret, refusing to let the outside world in. The secret is dirty and full of disease, it’s evil, it’s what made their mom paranoid. So paranoid that sometimes her own children were her enemies and the target of her deeply embedded pain, hence the horrible abuse they suffered growing up. In their still innocent eyes, it was something “out there”, that made her crazy. <br/>Due to its subject matter I am keen to use the film to raise awareness for the often-unspoken impact of abuse on children and the painful mental health effects when it goes unaddressed from generation to generation.<br/>Some people still do not think of film making as an art form because of its mass entertainment qualities. Though we envision glamorous movie stars accepting awards for their exceptional performances at lavish ceremonies, an entire world of film exists outside of that notion. This is where independent film exists…It is a bridge that merges people and ideas.<br/>Donate now and join us on this incredible journey. You have the option of making your donation, while at the same time helping to create a feature film by and about amazing women. What an exciting opportunity to be able to contribute DIRECTLY to the making of a moving, entertaining, beautiful, transformational piece of art that will be seen by audiences all over the world. We look forward to you joining our Circle of Partners!<br/>I would like to thank you for considering this opportunity to partner with our organization for raising funds. If you have any queries regarding our organization, our fund management policy, or the project itself, please feel free to contact me at curesacure@gmail.com. Your donation will bring us closer to our goal of $150,000.<br/>Many business and community leaders are on board as well as hundreds of individuals. Our community is clearly excited and eager to see this project succeed. You can be a part of the excitement and support our project by donating now using the link below.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>:</p>
<p>Shakespeare’s Othello, perhaps the finest work of tragedy ever composed, brought to the big screen. Act 3 scene 3 and act 5 scene 2 intercut into a single scene; distraught and paranoid, Othello falls prey to Iago’s vile machinations and turns on her wife, seeing the violent future with oracular vision. </p> <p><strong>Goal</strong>: </p>
<p>In creating this film, we aim to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deliver a faithful, compelling depiction of this brilliant scene.</li>
<li>Share our love of Shakespeare and bring the scene to a new audience.</li>
<li>Open up the character of Othello to a woman and experiment with how that changes the drama.</li>
</ul> <p><strong>What we need:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Production design: we’re using a modernized military setting to foreground the trust our characters are supposed to share. If we want to do this and hold to the script, we need costumes and set decoration.</li>
<li>Props: at the apex of our scene, we have Othello throwing a bottle against a wall out of pure rage. To do this, we need multiple sugar glass bottles to ensure we get the shot.</li>
<li>Crew quality: we’re working with some incredibly talented crew who we would love to be able to compensate for their labor and expenses.</li>
</ul> <p><strong>What you get:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Behind the scenes look at our production and rehearsal process; you’ll be right here beside us from start to finish.</li>
<li>Be the first to see the final cut when we release.</li>
<li>Our undying gratitude!</li>
</ul> <p><strong>Risks and Challenges</strong></p>
<p>During times like these, risks and challenges are always involved so we must be prepared for them. Here are a few ways we are preparing to take on these challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>To keep all our crew and cast safe, we will follow the regional governments regulations and employ COVID Safety Officers on set who will make sure that everything is safe and sound.</li>
<li>The text: Shakespeare is of course public domain, which means we can use and edit it as we need. Normally in film the rehearsal process takes place mainly on the day of shooting.

<h3>It's a modern take on American folklore. It is a reflection of modern day struggles mixed with old terrors. </h3>
<p>There is plenty of folklore in America, but one of the most prominent creatures is the wendigo. A wendigo is never born a monster, they are human before they commit the horrific sin of cannibalism. When this story was developed, the idea of the corrupted man was incredibly important to the writer. He wanted to create a terrifying and equally fascinating rendition of this beast while showing it parallel to a man who has also sinned. Both these characters have sinned, but one is the monstrous version of the other.</p>
<p>Though this is a horror movie with plenty of focus on a terrifying creature, it is also a story about human nature and the will to survive.</p>
<p>If you love films that focus heavily on monster horror and folklore, you will love this film. Many things about this film originate from American folklore and modern day lore. This is a story that send chills up your spine and leaves you wondering what is out there in the dark.</p>

<h3>The Story: High Noon — With Balloons!</h3>
<p>Two rival balloon twisters engage in an epic duel at a children's party with incredible, magical results!<br/><br/>Mike, a shy entertainer who considers the balloon animals filling his apartment as his friends, is thrilled to get booked by affable dad Conner for Avery's 10th birthday party. A big kid at heart, Mike loves inspiring joy and awe in kids with his impressive balloon creations; he's also in dire need of a paycheck.<br/><br/>To Mike's chagrin, his nemesis Steve, a pompous showman who craves the spotlight, has been double booked by Karen, Avery's prim mom. Karen's inclined to let the two twisters vie for the coveted paycheck by competing for it. A battle of wits, talent, and creativity, the twisters' duel produces hilarious, hazardous, and reality-bending results.<br/><br/>Our hero realizes he must rise to the challenge in order to best his opponent in the showdown of his life. It's high noon — with balloons!</p>

<h3>
<br/>The Project: A Visually-Rich, Comedic Short</h3>
<p>Written and directed by Kevin Murray, produced by Chip White, and based on a story developed with Ted Patterson and Zade Patterson, ""A Twistful of Dollars"" is intended to be a quirky comedy centered around a magical, reality-bending balloon duel. The film also incorporates themes relating to self confidence, rising to challenges and overcoming obstacles, and being true to and believing in one's self no matter what others may say or think.</p>
<p>The premise also highlights a unique and under-appreciated field of entertainment — balloon twisting. Just as the two twisters endeavor to bring joy to their audience of children, this short intends to bring a little joy to its audience, as well.</p>
<p>As balloon twisters twist, tie, combine, and form unique shapes and creations, the film's narrative and visual style will evoke that same spirit and creativity by utilizing:<br/>- traditional with bold and fluid camera movements<br/>- unconventional editing techniques<br/>- a cinematic yet vibrant lighting and wardrobe palette<br/>- whimsical original music and sound design</p>

<h3>
<br/>The Balloon Battle: We Want It to Pop!</h3>
<p>The goal is to do most, if not all, of the balloon battle practically in camera, utilizing actual balloon weaponry props and visual gags/stunts in conjunction with clever camera movements, editing, sound effects/design, and minimal VFX flourishes.<br/><br/><i>Some preliminary pics from our early balloon props/effects tests:</i></p>

</div></div>","The Story: High Noon — With Balloons!
Two rival balloon twisters engage in an epic duel at a children's party with incredible, magical results!Mike, a shy entertainer who considers the balloon animals filling his apartment as his friends, is thrilled to get booked by affable dad Conner for Avery's 10th birthday party. A big kid at heart, Mike loves inspiring joy and awe in kids with his impressive balloon creations; he's also in dire need of a paycheck.To Mike's chagrin, his nemesis Steve, a pompous showman who craves the spotlight, has been double booked by Karen, Avery's prim mom. Karen's inclined to let the two twisters vie for the coveted paycheck by competing for it. A battle of wits, talent, and creativity, the twisters' duel produces hilarious, hazardous, and reality-bending results.Our hero realizes he must rise to the challenge in order to best his opponent in the showdown of his life. It's high noon — with balloons!


The Project: A Visually-Rich, Comedic Short
Written and directed by Kevin Murray, produced by Chip White, and based on a story developed with Ted Patterson and Zade Patterson, ""A Twistful of Dollars"" is intended to be a quirky comedy centered around a magical, reality-bending balloon duel. The film also incorporates themes relating to self confidence, rising to challenges and overcoming obstacles, and being true to and believing in one's self no matter what others may say or think.
The premise also highlights a unique and under-appreciated field of entertainment — balloon twisting. Just as the two twisters endeavor to bring joy to their audience of children, this short intends to bring a little joy to its audience, as well.
As balloon twisters twist, tie, combine, and form unique shapes and creations, the film's narrative and visual style will evoke that same spirit and creativity by utilizing:- traditional with bold and fluid camera movements- unconventional editing techniques- a cinematic yet vibrant lighting and wardrobe palette- whimsical original music and sound design



The Balloon Battle: We Want It to Pop!
The goal is to do most, if not all, of the balloon battle practically in camera, utilizing actual balloon weaponry props and visual gags/stunts in conjunction with clever camera movements, editing, sound effects/design, and minimal VFX flourishes.Some preliminary pics from our early balloon props/effects tests:

A comparison to the look/feel of the final product might be the battle sequences in Edgar Wright's ""Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World.""

Our story follows a seemingly sweet elderly woman named Dot. This woman replants her garden after it is destroyed by her neighbor's son Charlie. Throughout the story DOT talks to herself and her flowers, touching on themes of life, death, and regrowth. Our film takes a deadly turn when it’s revealed that Dot’s hole is much deeper than is required for gardening. </p><p> </p><h3>BAD SEED</h3><p>Our short film is told through the antagonists’ lens, portraying DOT as an innocent elderly woman. As the story twists the audience is clued into Dot’s evil nature through her poetic dialogue. Dot’s dialogue is meant to be read as a free verse poem. We were originally inspired by the ‘100 words film festival’ to create our short film series within a 100 word dialogue limit! This constraint has positively impacted our writing process by causing us to be very cautious with the words and symbols we express! After writing our fourth draft, we got into a flow, realizing that simplicity was the key to our project! Another aspect of this project that sets us apart from other productions is the time duration of our short film series. Each episode is going to take up 3 to 5 minutes of screen time so that it can be easily shared across all social media platforms. While posting to social media we will create smaller teaser trailers, and promotional videos for Tik Tok and Instagram. The idea of our promotional content is to surmise media attention, then route audiences to YouTube for the full length premiere. </p><h3> </h3><h3>OUR STORY</h3><p>Our writing duo first met in a 6th grade environmental science class. Even as children, Cora and I would repeatedly race against each other to finish copying our class notes so that we could have more time to; talk about our favorite movies, what our moms packed for lunch, and whatever else our ten year old minds found important at the time. Over the years we became tied to the hip, as we each found our love for art through the exploration of various mediums. The next addition to our production team was Sean Killion (DOP). We first met Sean in our Junior year of high school through mutual friends. Sean was very influential in opening my eyes to the possibilities of film, and how we could use the medium to inform, gather attention, and help those in need. Together in our Senior year of high school we did what all young filmmakers do… We made a psychological thriller about a girl struggling with addiction, who is haunted by a ghost. Yeah… While the film lacked substance, we learned a lot about ourselves, and how we work together. Most notably, we bonded. We found our passion, and realized that we wanted to pursue the film industry as a team. </p><p>After leaving for college we each headed in different directions but still found time to; FaceTime, keep up with each other’s lives, and plan projects for when we could see each other. It was at this point that we met Michael Rodgers (Cinematography, Grip &amp; Jack of all trades). Mike is the guy. That’s all you need to know. Together we have embarked on this journey and we hope you come along for the ride!</p><p> </p><h2>OUR TEAM</h2><h3>Jake Lindsay </h3><p>Jake Lindsay is one of our screenwriters, producers, and swingman for ‘Bad Seed’. Jake’s attention to detail can be seen throughout his; abstract paintings, ceramics, metal sculptures, screenwriting abilities, musical pursuits, and on set management. Jake is largely inspired by artists similar to; Salvador Dali, Claude Monet, Henry David Thoreau, Edgar Allan Poe, Andrew Bird, The Beatles, Whitney, and Fleetwood Mac. Jake is a recent graduate of Temple University where he earned his Bachelor's Degree in Media and Communications, with a concentration in Film Production. During college Jake took a wide variety of; Video &amp; Audio Production, Visual Art, Graphic Design, Communication Theory, Advertising and Business courses. Such areas of study offered Jake the ability to understand the; time, labor, and costs associated with producing a short film from conception to distribution. Jake has applied what he's learned to his own startup art business where he sells his abstract art pieces on instagram (and can be seen at @Philly_AbstractArt). Other activities that catch Jake's attention are; this short film series, his and Cora's’ musical pursuits, hiking, live music, and managing Spruce Live content! (@ SpruceMediatv on Instagram).</p><p> </p><h3>Cora Sfida</h3><p>Cora Sfida is one of our writers and producers for ‘Bad Seed’. She has also been an actor, dancer, musician, and visual artist since she was a kid. Cora takes her inspiration from artists such as; Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Alexander Ekamn, Greta Gurwig, Rainer Maria Rilke, and Elizabeth Gilbert.  She has studied at University of Wisconsin Stevens Point for a brief time studying for a BFA in Acting and a BA in Dance. Before deciding that she needed to take a leap of faith and move to her dream city, to go after the artistic life she wanted. This Spring Cora graduated from the Maggie Flanigan Studio in New York from a 2 year Professional Actor Training Program. These past two years Cora has indulged in her writing skills and has been working on 3 full length plays, screenwriting nightly with Jake, selling paintings, and becoming a certified reiki practitioner, and writing and producing music. This is Cora’s first production as a co-writer and producer for a short film. It has been her lifelong dream to create art that brings perspective to people's everyday lives.  </p><p> </p><h3>Sean Killion</h3><p>Sean Killion is our Director of Photography and Concept Artist. Sean’s passion for film can be seen throughout his 3D art, screenwriting, and music. He is inspired by Kurosawa and Cubrick, who have each aided in furthering Sean’s storytelling ability. Sean is a co-founder of Spruce Media and has directed music videos for Bless Watson ‘Coastal Twist’, Tree Theatre ‘Flowers’, and Monster Energy’s ‘Up and Up’ Festival. As a concept artist Sean primarily creates environments, buildings, spaceships, and other concepts to be used in VFX post production. Sean is also a musician, and has been playing guitar and piano since he was a child. We are very lucky to have Sean as our director, and friend!</p><p> </p><h3>Mike Rogers</h3><p>Mike Rogers is our Cinematography, Grip &amp; Jack of all trades. As a Co-founder of Spruce Media Mike manages all of Spruce Media’s video content during each stage of production. Before starting Spruce Media Mike was a freelance photographer; Sporting events, Weddings, Real Estate, Modeling Photography, Portrait Photography, etc. Eventually Mike started to make videos for Rap, Hip Hop, Alternative Rock bands &amp; solo artists. Mike has worked with Bless Watson to create ‘Blue Notes’ &amp; ‘Coastal Twist’, Tree Theatre ‘Flowers’, and all Spruce Live content. Not only is Mike a great filmmaker, but he is a very talented musician. Mike has been playing guitar and piano since the age of 6 and taught himself by ear. Coincidentally Mike has been playing in Alternative Rock &amp; Psychedelic Indie bands ever since middle school. Mike has helped create albums with Messin Around and Entropy. Mike has also been an event coordinator for music festivals such as; ‘Launch Music Festival’, ‘Summer of Love’, and ‘Electric Halloween’. Mike’s taste in music has been influenced by many artists such as Jim Carrey’s and Will Ferrell films, Foo Fighters, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Led Zeppelin and Greenday. For all of these reasons and more Mike is a great asset to our team and we’re very lucky to have him. </p><p> </p><h3>RISKS and CHALLENGES</h3><p>One of the biggest challenges to our production was coordinating our schedules while living in two different states. Quickly Cora and I figured out that the most efficient way to work was through drafting multiple scripts. Throughout the day we would each write drafts and idea fragments. Then later on in the evenings, we would review each of our drafts together night after night. Over time we started to pick up on each other’s writing flow, and gained speed. This system worked very well during our writing process and afforded us with a plethora of episode ideas for the series! </p><p>Another challenge we’re faced with during our production are strict Covid compliance guidelines. This will dramatically affect how our production runs, in order to keep our cast and crew safe. We will do this by taking all the necessary steps we can without infringing on people's right to be wary of a new Covid vaccine. </p><p>The last challenge we have learned to traverse is our communication! We repeatedly learned this, as we each struggled to let go of our original script ideas, as they matured throughout the redrafting process. We combated this by reading each of our drafts one by one, until we found the perfect layout. Through discussion we came together to mold our ideas into one cohesive piece. As a result we created something we were not only proud of, but that spoke to each of our talents. </p><p> </p><h3>Budget breakdown:</h3><p>Set Construction Cost: $1200</p><p>Construction of the garden, labor, and flowers. </p><p> </p><p>Location cost $600</p><p>Renting, Permits, and compensation for the owners of the location for the 3-5 days of shooting. </p><p> </p><p>Cast and Crew, Catering, and Travel Costs’ $4100</p><p>Total compensation for all crew: $3000 </p><p>Catering: $700</p><p>Travel: $400</p><p> </p><p>Wardrobe and Props: $900</p><p>Will afford our Production Designer the freedom to acquire all dressing needed to create an accurate depiction of life.

In addition we will have  masks, hand sanitizer, and equipment sanitation on hand, during the entire shoot. This is to protect our cast and crew who may have a auto immune deficiency, or family member with an auto immune deficiency. </p><p> </p><p>Festival Submissions $400</p><p>We will be submitting our short film to multiple festivals such as; . </p><p>Web Series Festival GlobaL, Raindance WebFest, Tribeca Film Festival New Online Works (N.O.W), <span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Austin Film Festival: Produced Digital Series Program</span>, Catalyst Contest Festival, <span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Chicago Indie Film Awards, New York Television Festival: Independent Pilot Program</span>, HollyWeb Fest, LA Sci-Fi Film Festival/ LA Indie Film Festival (Web Series Program)*, Miami Web Fest</p><p> </p><p>Total Bad Seed Budget: $7,500</p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>FUNDING STRETCH GOALS</h3><p> </p><p>$10,000- This would allow us to cover all production costs, making sure that our cast and crew are heavily compensated for their hard work.

Before deciding that she needed to take a leap of faith and move to her dream city, to go after the artistic life she wanted. This Spring Cora graduated from the Maggie Flanigan Studio in New York from a 2 year Professional Actor Training Program. These past two years Cora has indulged in her writing skills and has been working on 3 full length plays, screenwriting nightly with Jake, selling paintings, and becoming a certified reiki practitioner, and writing and producing music. This is Cora’s first production as a co-writer and producer for a short film. It has been her lifelong dream to create art that brings perspective to people's everyday lives.   Sean KillionSean Killion is our Director of Photography and Concept Artist. Sean’s passion for film can be seen throughout his 3D art, screenwriting, and music. He is inspired by Kurosawa and Cubrick, who have each aided in furthering Sean’s storytelling ability. Sean is a co-founder of Spruce Media and has directed music videos for Bless Watson ‘Coastal Twist’, Tree Theatre ‘Flowers’, and Monster Energy’s ‘Up and Up’ Festival. As a concept artist Sean primarily creates environments, buildings, spaceships, and other concepts to be used in VFX post production. Sean is also a musician, and has been playing guitar and piano since he was a child. We are very lucky to have Sean as our director, and friend! Mike RogersMike Rogers is our Cinematography, Grip & Jack of all trades. As a Co-founder of Spruce Media Mike manages all of Spruce Media’s video content during each stage of production. Before starting Spruce Media Mike was a freelance photographer; Sporting events, Weddings, Real Estate, Modeling Photography, Portrait Photography, etc. Eventually Mike started to make videos for Rap, Hip Hop, Alternative Rock bands & solo artists. Mike has worked with Bless Watson to create ‘Blue Notes’ & ‘Coastal Twist’, Tree Theatre ‘Flowers’, and all Spruce Live content. Not only is Mike a great filmmaker, but he is a very talented musician. Mike has been playing guitar and piano since the age of 6 and taught himself by ear. Coincidentally Mike has been playing in Alternative Rock & Psychedelic Indie bands ever since middle school. Mike has helped create albums with Messin Around and Entropy. Mike has also been an event coordinator for music festivals such as; ‘Launch Music Festival’, ‘Summer of Love’, and ‘Electric Halloween’. Mike’s taste in music has been influenced by many artists such as Jim Carrey’s and Will Ferrell films, Foo Fighters, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Led Zeppelin and Greenday. For all of these reasons and more Mike is a great asset to our team and we’re very lucky to have him.  RISKS and CHALLENGESOne of the biggest challenges to our production was coordinating our schedules while living in two different states. Quickly Cora and I figured out that the most efficient way to work was through drafting multiple scripts. Throughout the day we would each write drafts and idea fragments. Then later on in the evenings, we would review each of our drafts together night after night. Over time we started to pick up on each other’s writing flow, and gained speed. This system worked very well during our writing process and afforded us with a plethora of episode ideas for the series! Another challenge we’re faced with during our production are strict Covid compliance guidelines. This will dramatically affect how our production runs, in order to keep our cast and crew safe. We will do this by taking all the necessary steps we can without infringing on people's right to be wary of a new Covid vaccine. The last challenge we have learned to traverse is our communication! We repeatedly learned this, as we each struggled to let go of our original script ideas, as they matured throughout the redrafting process. We combated this by reading each of our drafts one by one, until we found the perfect layout. Through discussion we came together to mold our ideas into one cohesive piece. As a result we created something we were not only proud of, but that spoke to each of our talents.  Budget breakdown:Set Construction Cost: $1200Construction of the garden, labor, and flowers.  Location cost $600Renting, Permits, and compensation for the owners of the location for the 3-5 days of shooting.  Cast and Crew, Catering, and Travel Costs’ $4100Total compensation for all crew: $3000 Catering: $700Travel: $400 Wardrobe and Props: $900Will afford our Production Designer the freedom to acquire all dressing needed to create an accurate depiction of life. Props and Costumes will play a large role in telling our story accurately. Covid Precautions $300We will be following the CDC guidelines, including testing as a requirement before being on set. In addition we will have  masks, hand sanitizer, and equipment sanitation on hand, during the entire shoot. This is to protect our cast and crew who may have a auto immune deficiency, or family member with an auto immune deficiency.  Festival Submissions $400We will be submitting our short film to multiple festivals such as; . Web Series Festival GlobaL, Raindance WebFest, Tribeca Film Festival New Online Works (N.O.W), Austin Film Festival: Produced Digital Series Program, Catalyst Contest Festival, Chicago Indie Film Awards, New York Television Festival: Independent Pilot Program, HollyWeb Fest, LA Sci-Fi Film Festival/ LA Indie Film Festival (Web Series Program)*, Miami Web Fest Total Bad Seed Budget: $7,500  FUNDING STRETCH GOALS $10,000- This would allow us to cover all production costs, making sure that our cast and crew are heavily compensated for their hard work. Exceeding our goal by this amount would allow us to buy more flowers, make a larger garden, order higher quality catering, and create a safe and loving environment for our cast and crew! $15,000- $20,000- This amount would allow us to really expand our horizons on the set of ‘Bad Seed’. Achieving this goal would enable our team to; hire professionals for sound design, & video editing. This goal would also provide the funds needed to rent an edelkrone, Jib One, and a larger lighting package.   THE IMPACT AND CONTRIBUTIONWhile each of these pre production tasks require time and energy, nothing compares to asking YOU for help in achieving our artistic vision. With your support, we will be able to; buy more flowers to fill the entire garden, pay our actors, purchase higher quality food, and purchase additional wardrobe. In exchange for your generosity, check out our perks to see if they interest you! Our perks include; stickers, paintings, a self care bundle, T-Shirt, special thanks video, Film Trivia Night, Exclusive Premieres, BTS footage, Script Consultation, and an Executive Producer credit.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i>Our Story</i></h3> <p>In “Closed Seams,” a newly single seamstress has to salvage a disastrous photoshoot; during the shoot, however, she finds more than just loose threads.  A quiet 16mm drama following moments of natural, human texture accompanied by grandiose photoshoot montages.  With a short 5-to-6-minute runtime, we hope to make every second pointed and impactful.  </p> <h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i>Our Goals</i></h3> <p>Every love story begins with a brief encounter.  While they don’t always go on to mean something - see, David Lean’s Brief Encounter (1945) - they almost always begin with the same thing: friendship.  In “Closed Seams,” we’re telling the story of the meeting of two young women - both in relationships of rocky status and varying happiness.  It’s the story of how the briefest meetings, the simplest acts of kindness, have the ability to transform into life long love.   The ﬁlm leaves the latter part of that hypothesis unanswered, but we want the audience to leave feeling some sort of (right or wrong) idealized happiness - like they could ﬁnd lifelong love at any moment and any time. </p>
<p>While the story follows two bisexual women, this is very much not a “lesbian” ﬁlm.  There is a place for stories of trauma and angst in minority communities, but this is not that.  It’s a love story that just so happens to follow two women - using the universal language of longing and love, and it’s our responsibility to normalize relationships and attitudes about sexuality that should have been normalized long ago.  “Closed Seams” is not a progressive romance; it’s a romance.  It’s the year 2021 and as has been screamed from rooftops for years, love is love. </p>
<p>With “Closed Seams,” we’re hoping to bring a little happiness to a world plagued, at least in this year, by tragedy and depression.  We’re targeting both young and old people.  It’s not a volatile or excessively inappropriate ﬁlm.  By many metrics, it could even be labeled as inconsequential.  While that’s normally a death knell for art, maybe that’s what we need right now.  A ﬁve minute love story that will make people think, and leave them happier for the rest of their day - maybe even their week. </p> <h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i>Core Crew</i></h3>

<p>While our target goal may seem like a tall order, here’s why every penny we can raise counts: As “Closed Seams” will be a post-graduation film for our director, we’ll need funds for locations, camera department, G&amp;E equipment, and feeding our crew.  Our primary studio location will play an important part in telling our story, as it primarily takes place during a high art fashion photoshoot.  While the studio we currently have booked will provide us the room and light needed for a shoot of such caliber, our art department will play a key role in setting the scene and bringing the viewer into the world.  Similarly, we’ve chosen to shoot our story on 16mm film.  It’s an unusual choice on short films (or any film) these days, but the texture, colors, and workflow is something that is essential to our film’s aesthetic.  Finally, as many short films never see the light of day, we want to ensure that “Closed Seams” is different.  With high hopes for various festival runs upon completion, we’ve budgeted for festival submissions with intentions of presenting our film to the right audiences. </p> <p>Because every donation gets us closer and closer to our goal, every individual contributor will be added under a, “Special Thanks” credit of our film.  Of course, the more you donate, the more involved your perk will be, building off of previous rewards.  All digital perks will be sent out by the end of the campaign, and all physical perks will be sent out by the end of August, 2021.</p> <h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i>Risks &amp; Challenges</i></h3> <p>Our primary challenges for this shoot lie in safety-complications brought about by COVID 19.  Because this is our director’s first post-Covid film, we want to ensure the health and safety of all cast and crew involved during production.  While the entirety of our team is to be vaccinated by our shoot days in July, “Closed Seams” intends on providing proper safety and sanitation tools to our cast and crew at all points of production, hence our budget for sanitation and safety materials.  As the entirety of this film takes place inside, our team will wear masks during production with the exception of actors on camera during takes.  Of course, during all points of production, “Closed Seams” will be closely following CDC guidelines to provide a safe shooting environment for all involved.</p> <h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i>Other Ways You Can Help</i></h3>

<p>Con tu contribución podremos cubrir las siguientes necesidades básicas de producción:</p>
<ul><li><i><u>Comida:</u> 250$</i></li></ul>
<p>Para la alimentación de un equipo técnico de cinco personas y un elenco de siete actores durante diez días de rodaje. La distribución de este dinero esta pensada para desayunos, almuerzos, cenas y meriendas durante jornadas de trabajo que pueden variar entre ocho y diez horas.</p>

<p>With your contribution we can cover the following basic production needs:</p>
<ul><li>
<u><i>Food: </i></u><i>$ 250 </i>
</li></ul>
<p>For the feeding a crew of five people and a cast of seven actors during ten days of filming. The distribution of this money is for breakfasts, lunches, dinners and snacks during work days that can vary between eight and ten hours long.</p>
<ul><li><i><u>Transportation: </u>$ 200 </i></li></ul>
<p>Considering the situation in Venezuela with the shortage of gasoline due to the pandemic, the crew will stay together in one place throughout the process, so that this money will be distributed exclusively for the transport of the actors, in search of savings due to high gasoline prices.

<ul><li><i><u>Logistic production items: </u>$ 20</i></li></ul>
<p>Disposable tools of constant use and of huge importance for the comfortable and effective development of the production, such as adhesive tape and alkaline batteries.</p>
<ul><li><i><u>First aid: </u>$ 40</i></li></ul>
<p>Accidents, discomfort or sickness due to exhaustion are common during filming.

<p>The criteria for choosing the cast that will play the main characters is determined by a direction proposal that requires a certain level of acting experience and theatrical knowledge. In this project we want to take into account the value of the time of experienced actors who have invested part of their lives in the development of their art. That is why we consult with each of the actors, the possibility of an agreement regarding the payment of their fees.

<ul><li><i><u>Camera: </u>$ 150</i></li></ul>
<p>Most of the lighting and recording equipment that will be used is property of the Escuela nacional de cine, to which we belong as students. These kits will be loaned to us as part of the student project agreement. But, to achieve the aesthetic and visual proposal thought by the director and cinematographer, it is necessary to rent a Sony alpha camera due to its dynamic range, which is very different than the one offered by the film school, a Canon DSLR.</p>
<h3>Visión del director / Director's vision</h3>
<p>Este es un proyecto creado con la motivación de dedicárselo a todas las personas que necesitan expresarse y crear para vivir, pero que no lo consiguen o les cuesta mantenerse económicamente haciendo lo que les gusta.</p>
<p>Para el desarrollo de esta idea pensé en combinar lo que me mueve a crear como artista y lo que se me opone para lograrlo. En mi caso, lo que me mueve es expresar mi visión del mundo y comunicar lo que siento de una forma hermosa a través de una historia. Lo que se me opone es el poco tiempo que tengo para hacerlo, ya que si quiero pagar las cuentas, en la mayoría de los casos debo trabajar en cosas que no me permiten expresarme como quiero. Por otro lado, la única manera de hacerlo es dejar de poner excusas y hacer todo lo que esté en mi poder por equilibrar mi tiempo, pero esto suele convertirse en una situación tan estresante que me lleva a recurrir al auto saboteo y a manejar el estrés con distracciones que solo hacen que pierda más tiempo.</p>
<p>Como estudiante de una escuela de cine en la última etapa de sus estudios, son constantes los pensamientos de miedo y las interrogantes sin respuesta acerca de la sustentabilidad económica de mi profesión en Venezuela, un país sin una industria de cine establecida y con pocas esperanzas de que eso cambie en un tiempo cercano. Por otro lado, creo que este tema sobre el desarrollo profesional y la incertidumbre, se combinan con la manera en que veo como los jóvenes lidiamos con los problemas. La experimentación con drogas y alcohol suele ser algo común durante la juventud y más si se trata de un ambiente creativo. Pero esto también representa un riesgo muy real, ya que cuando las adicciones nacen en la juventud es posible que una persona pase por varios estadios, desde etapas de auto sabotaje para su desarrollo como persona, hasta llevarlo a una total decadencia en la toma de decisiones y que terminan por arruinar la vida de alguien con talento y potencial.</p>
<p>Esa es la historia que quiero contar, la de una persona con talento que no superó sus etapas de experimentación adolescente y que nunca llegó a alcanzar su máximo potencial por el auto sabotaje, alguien que por miedo a no lograrlo, no hizo lo necesario para superarse y encontrar su lugar en el mundo haciendo lo que le gusta, pero que ahora la vida le brinda una nueva oportunidad de lograrlo y empezar de nuevo.</p>
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>This is a project created with the motivation of dedicating it to all the people who need to express themselves and craft in order to live, but do not succeed at it, or find difficult to maintain themselves economically doing what they love.</p>
<p>For the development of this idea, I thought about combining what moves me as an artist to create and what is against me to achieve it. What moves me is expressing my vision of the world and communicating what I feel in a beautiful way through a story. What is against me is the little time I have to do it, because if I want to pay the bills, in most cases I have to work on things that don't allow me to express myself as I wish I could. On the other hand, the only way to do that is to stop making excuses and do everything in my power to balance my time, but this often becomes such a stressful situation that it leads me to self-sabotage and to manage stress with distractions that only waste more time.</p>
<p>As a film student in the last stage of my studies, the thoughts of fear and unanswered questions about the economic sustainability of my profession in Venezuela are constant, in a country without an established film industry and with little hope of this changing in the near future. I think this subjects about professional development and the uncertainty of the future is combined with the way I see young people dealing with their problems. Experimentation with drugs and alcohol is something common during youth and can be even closer if it's a creative environment. This also represents a very real risk, because if addictions are born during youth it's possible that they go through multiple stages, from stages of self-sabotage, to leading a person to a total decline in decision-making that ends up ruining the life of someone with talent and potential.</p>
<p>The story I want to tell is about a talented person who did not overcome his stages of adolescent experimentation because of self-sabotage and never reached his full potential, someone who because of fear of never making it, did not do what it takes to improve himself and find his place in the world doing what he loves. But now life gives him a new opportunity to achieve that and start over.</p>

Necesitamos tu ayuda para contar esta historia / We need your help to tell this story
Con tu contribución podremos cubrir las siguientes necesidades básicas de producción:
Comida: 250$
Para la alimentación de un equipo técnico de cinco personas y un elenco de siete actores durante diez días de rodaje. La distribución de este dinero esta pensada para desayunos, almuerzos, cenas y meriendas durante jornadas de trabajo que pueden variar entre ocho y diez horas.
Transporte: 200$
Considerando la situación que se vive en Venezuela con la escasez de gasolina debido a la pandemia, el equipo técnico se mantendrá junto en un solo lugar durante todo el proceso, de manera que este dinero será distribuido exclusivamente para el transporte de los actores, en busca del ahorro debido a los elevados precios de la gasolina. Una parte será destinada a el pago de taxis de algunos de los actores y la otra parte será destinada a la compra de suficiente gasolina regulada para las personas con carro que nos ayuden a realizar el transporte de los demás actores.
Artículos de producción de campo: 20$
​Herramientas desechables pero de uso constante y de suma importancia para el cómodo y efectivo desarrollo de la producción, como lo son la cinta adhesiva y las baterías alcalinas.

Primeros auxilios: 40$

Es común que durante los rodajes ocurran accidentes y malestares debido al agotamiento. Considerando que en este caso, muchas de las locaciones son exteriores en una montaña, debemos estar preparados para enfrentar el clima, la fauna y en especial estar preparados ante cualquier accidente que pueda amenazar la integridad física del equipo.

Honorario de actores: 240$

​El criterio de elección del elenco que interpretara  a los personajes principales esta determinado por una propuesta de dirección que requiere cierto nivel de experiencia actoral y conocimiento teatral . En este proyecto queremos tomar en cuenta el valor del tiempo de los actores experimentados que han invertido parte de su vida en el desarrollo de su arte. Es por eso que consultamos con cada uno de los actores, la posibilidad de un acuerdo con respecto al pago de sus honorarios.  Pero siempre tomando en cuenta que el presupuesto de este proyecto y el nivel de producción es estudiantil .
Cámara: 150$
​La mayor parte de los equipos de iluminación y registro que se usaran para la grabación son propiedad de la Escuela nacional de cine, a la cual pertenecemos como estudiantes. Estos equipos serán prestados a nosotros como parte del acuerdo de proyecto estudiantil. Pero para que se pueda lograr la propuesta estética y visual pensada por el director y el director de fotografía, es necesario el alquiler de una cámara Sony alpha debido al rango dinámico que posee, muy distinto al que puede alcanzar una DSLR Canon ofrecida por la escuela de cine.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<div>Welcome to the crowdfunding campaign for my incoming Public Service Announcement - “Ey! Don’t Pick”. My name is <a href=""http://www.lilywenyihuang.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lily Huang</a> and I am a student film director at New York University. I came to the United States almost 8 years ago to pursue my education with fresh curiosity, keen determination on broadening my understanding of the world, and most importantly, full faith in making the world a better place where people from all walks of life comfortably hold respectful conversations with one another. All of these remain my deepest passion till this day. Yet, violence and distrust seems to have strangled us at the moment. You are mostly likely aware of the horrifying hate crimes against the AAPI community in the United States that spiked since the beginning of the COVID pandemic. Putting the pain into words at the moment even seems surreal to me, in the worst way possible. It is a feeling of unbearable anguish as if someone had wiped out my ability to form sentences — tell me, if you can, where and how do I begin to explain my humanity?</div>
<div> </div>
<p>This piece is me bundling up my energy as a Chinese woman, a filmmaker, a resident of New York City,  and a human who simply cannot tolerate and stay quiet when innocent people, let alone elderlies, are being beaten up and smashed to the ground. This 30-second PSA might feel short and my influence as a filmmaker may not be big enough to beat the roaring monster of hate and prejudice instantly. But it is with your help that we might be able to do something. And at the end of the day, there is just something more significant than “usefulness”. This particularly goes out to my fellow AAPI brothers and sisters, uncles and aunties, grandmas and grandpas. I know it is hard for us to endorse our believe in things getting better at the moment, but I want you to know that together we are not alone. We do something, anything, one thing at a time.

<p>Our short film is based on Jonah’s personal experiences of being a lone soldier in the IDF and growing up in the British Jewish community. Even though we are a tiny minority in the UK, people don’t realise how diverse we are in opinion. After all, we all know the saying: three Jews equals five opinions! </p>
<p>Growing up in the Jewish community in London, everyone grows up being taught one thing by their school and their family, but when they go to university, start working or even like Jonah, join the army, you then learn that you need to form your own voice. However, the great thing about being Jewish is there is no right way to be a Jew. </p>
<p>This short film does not attempt to debate any of the moral questions of the IDF. Instead, we aim to provide an amusing insight into the culture of British Jewry in the UK, which is an under-represented ethnic minority.  Therefore, we want to help bring more Jewish stories to the spotlight. Through the medium of humour, we hope this film will encourage all minority voices to be listened to within the Jewish community and raise meaningful discussions about Jewish identity around the diaspora.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Kamila Dydyna and I'm a Polish filmmaker based in Dublin. I've wanted to make films for as long as I remember. </p>
<p>When I was growing up though, I could have just as well wished to join NASA and visit the Moon. At the time, I was a member of the Jehovah's Witnesses community. My life revolved around regular preaching sessions, meetings with the congregation, studying the Bible and so on. Even dreaming about a career in anything else than being a stellar Jehovah's Witness was, technically speaking, forbidden.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571074220/wdatwsbptjynjwjkefwa.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Fast forward about 25 years, multiple metaphorical earthquakes later, I clawed my way out of the religious fervour, through an adventure with corporate life, and into a freelance filmmaking world. I avoided talking about my past as a Jehovah's Witness for many years after I had left the religion. I was ashamed, I felt like a victim, and I was angry. But now I'm at a point in my life where I realised I can't walk away from that aspect of my past completely, at least not before making this film.</p>
<p>In the past few years, I made two short films (more on that later), and I'm now ready to tell the story of <i>Debutante</i>, in partnership with <strong><a href=""https://atheist.ie"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Atheist Ireland</a></strong>, an advocacy group promoting secularism.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What is the film about?</h3>
<p><strong>Debutante is a short, contemporary drama set in the world of Irish Jehovah's Witnesses. It's a story of an 18-year-old Meg, who experiences, in a rather sever way, the overbearing religious control practiced by the members of this community. At its heart, it's a film about growing up.</strong></p>
<p>My intention with Debutante is to avoid a demeaning, hateful or sensationalist approach (as one often used with the subject of Jehovah’s Witnesses) in favour of one more compassionate. </p>
<p>There are over <strong>8.5 million Jehovah's Witnesses</strong> in the world and they operate in exactly the same way in each of the <strong>240 countries and territories</strong> where they live. As such, it felt natural to set this story in Dublin which has been my home for over 12 years now.</p>
<p>In the film, the exciting energy of young love and early experience of sexuality are met with the unforgiving and violating judgement by the religion elders. <strong>It’s a story of how receiving a mindf*ck of cognitive dissonance can shake loose the fundaments of who you think you are.</strong></p>
<p>The title refers to the French origin of the word - ""stepping out into the world for the first time"" or being a beginner, a person that begins life as an adult.</p>

<h3>Why Support This Particular Film?</h3>
<p>It is commonly thought that Jehovah's Witnesses - and any issues surrounding them - are a minority subject, not necessarily warranting attention. Except, of course, the commonly known issues related to the refusal of blood transfusion and the protection of pedophiles within their ranks, highlighted recently by the <a href=""https://www.childabuseroyalcommission.gov.au/case-studies/case-study-54-institutional-review-jehovahs-witnesses"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Australian Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Abuse</a> and a growing number of high profile court cases.</p>
<p>I think the negative impact Jehovah's Witnesses have on the global community is even more widespread. Let me explain why.</p>
<p>My Mum started hanging out with Jehovah’s Witnesses when I was about 10 years old. I couldn’t tell you why and how but within a year, I was completely hooked on the world and the beliefs of this religion. <strong>A sense of belonging to something special and greater than me was so intense, it went to my head. </strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571851126/btozzggeovlhucm9b6ab.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Nobody made me do it – at the age of 13, I was thrilled to be baptised as a Jehovah’s Witness in a portable pool set at a sports stadium in Wrocław, Poland. I was wearing a long T-shirt over my swim suit, for modesty.</p>
<p><strong>I used to believe that everyone who wasn’t a Witness was going to die an awful, ugly apocalyptic death. </strong>If I wasn’t conscientious and faithful in every little thing, I was going to die too. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571844721/wkpidx7bnfzcvtv2itzo.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The worst lot of all – to be avoided at any cost – was to be disfellowshipped (shunned.) It meant that none of your Jehovah’s Witnesses friends (and family if they were strict enough) would ever speak to you again. They would cross the road if they saw you on the street. And you wouldn’t have anyone else to turn to because having“worldly friends” was also not on.</p>
<p><strong>To be disfellowshipped meant that your world as you know it explodes and you become a ghost. You’re Bruce Willis in <i>The Sixth Sense</i>.</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1568824604/u3gtuwllbmfueuqqpd3v.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In early 2008, on the day I decided I no longer wanted to be a Jehovah's Witness, I felt like I was dying to my life and relationships as I knew them. It was a bit like (I imagine) the experience of being born - naked, terrified, and disconnected from the only safe place you had known - except as an adult.</p>
<p><strong>In 2018, the number of people baptised as Jehovah's Witnesses around the world was 281,744</strong>. However, a statistic that's harder to find is the number of people who got disfellowshipped (kicked out) or who left of their own initiative. That number is estimated at 70,000 - every year.</p>
<p>Taking into account those who return to the JW organisation, that's still at least <strong>a million people in recent years who had to find ways of creating a life from scratch outside of the religion's boundaries</strong>.</p>
<p>In best-case-scenarios, they deal with mental health issues resulting from a lifetime of indoctrination. They have to seek out new friends, relationships, careers and hobbies - all to keep it together outside of the JW world.</p>
<p>In worst-case-scenarios, they hang themselves in their bathrooms, while their children and spouses watch TV in the living room.</p>
<p>I deeply believe this is an issue worth talking about. <strong>And I hope my film will bring comfort to anyone who experienced shunning - for religious or other reasons. </strong></p>

Short Summary
My name is Kamila Dydyna and I'm a Polish filmmaker based in Dublin. I've wanted to make films for as long as I remember. 
When I was growing up though, I could have just as well wished to join NASA and visit the Moon. At the time, I was a member of the Jehovah's Witnesses community. My life revolved around regular preaching sessions, meetings with the congregation, studying the Bible and so on. Even dreaming about a career in anything else than being a stellar Jehovah's Witness was, technically speaking, forbidden.

Fast forward about 25 years, multiple metaphorical earthquakes later, I clawed my way out of the religious fervour, through an adventure with corporate life, and into a freelance filmmaking world. I avoided talking about my past as a Jehovah's Witness for many years after I had left the religion. I was ashamed, I felt like a victim, and I was angry. But now I'm at a point in my life where I realised I can't walk away from that aspect of my past completely, at least not before making this film.
In the past few years, I made two short films (more on that later), and I'm now ready to tell the story of Debutante, in partnership with Atheist Ireland, an advocacy group promoting secularism.
 
What is the film about?
Debutante is a short, contemporary drama set in the world of Irish Jehovah's Witnesses. It's a story of an 18-year-old Meg, who experiences, in a rather sever way, the overbearing religious control practiced by the members of this community. At its heart, it's a film about growing up.
My intention with Debutante is to avoid a demeaning, hateful or sensationalist approach (as one often used with the subject of Jehovah’s Witnesses) in favour of one more compassionate. 
There are over 8.5 million Jehovah's Witnesses in the world and they operate in exactly the same way in each of the 240 countries and territories where they live. As such, it felt natural to set this story in Dublin which has been my home for over 12 years now.
In the film, the exciting energy of young love and early experience of sexuality are met with the unforgiving and violating judgement by the religion elders. It’s a story of how receiving a mindf*ck of cognitive dissonance can shake loose the fundaments of who you think you are.
The title refers to the French origin of the word - ""stepping out into the world for the first time"" or being a beginner, a person that begins life as an adult.
 

Why Support This Particular Film?
It is commonly thought that Jehovah's Witnesses - and any issues surrounding them - are a minority subject, not necessarily warranting attention. Except, of course, the commonly known issues related to the refusal of blood transfusion and the protection of pedophiles within their ranks, highlighted recently by the Australian Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Abuse and a growing number of high profile court cases.
I think the negative impact Jehovah's Witnesses have on the global community is even more widespread. Let me explain why.
My Mum started hanging out with Jehovah’s Witnesses when I was about 10 years old. I couldn’t tell you why and how but within a year, I was completely hooked on the world and the beliefs of this religion. A sense of belonging to something special and greater than me was so intense, it went to my head. 

Nobody made me do it – at the age of 13, I was thrilled to be baptised as a Jehovah’s Witness in a portable pool set at a sports stadium in Wrocław, Poland. I was wearing a long T-shirt over my swim suit, for modesty.
I used to believe that everyone who wasn’t a Witness was going to die an awful, ugly apocalyptic death. If I wasn’t conscientious and faithful in every little thing, I was going to die too. 

The worst lot of all – to be avoided at any cost – was to be disfellowshipped (shunned.) It meant that none of your Jehovah’s Witnesses friends (and family if they were strict enough) would ever speak to you again. They would cross the road if they saw you on the street. And you wouldn’t have anyone else to turn to because having“worldly friends” was also not on.
To be disfellowshipped meant that your world as you know it explodes and you become a ghost. You’re Bruce Willis in The Sixth Sense.

In early 2008, on the day I decided I no longer wanted to be a Jehovah's Witness, I felt like I was dying to my life and relationships as I knew them. It was a bit like (I imagine) the experience of being born - naked, terrified, and disconnected from the only safe place you had known - except as an adult.
In 2018, the number of people baptised as Jehovah's Witnesses around the world was 281,744. However, a statistic that's harder to find is the number of people who got disfellowshipped (kicked out) or who left of their own initiative. That number is estimated at 70,000 - every year.
Taking into account those who return to the JW organisation, that's still at least a million people in recent years who had to find ways of creating a life from scratch outside of the religion's boundaries.
In best-case-scenarios, they deal with mental health issues resulting from a lifetime of indoctrination. They have to seek out new friends, relationships, careers and hobbies - all to keep it together outside of the JW world.
In worst-case-scenarios, they hang themselves in their bathrooms, while their children and spouses watch TV in the living room.
I deeply believe this is an issue worth talking about. And I hope my film will bring comfort to anyone who experienced shunning - for religious or other reasons. 
 
What We Need & What You Get
I'm deeply committed to making the film happen. However, I'm just as committed to giving this story an opportunity to reach the quality it deserves, and for that purpose, I need money.
My experience as a director and as a production manager on award-winning short films, documentaries and commercials, has taught me that to truly realise a creative vision for the unique medium of film, money is just as critical as passion and talent of the creative team. Hence, with this campaign, it's go big or go home.
Debutante's budget is €18,500, with the additional €1,500 to account for Indiegogo platform fees, bank transfer fees and currency conversion adjustments for donations from outside Ireland. The budget amount covers:
1) FIVE SHOOTING DAYS

camera & lighting equipment rental
modest but reasonable pay rates for cast & crew
costume & set design
catering
location fees
insurance

 
2) POST-PRODUCTION

edit
sound mix 
colour grade
original music score
cost of clearing original composition rights to a certain very well-known piece of music, which plays a key part in the story (think more 1960s musicals, less Ed Sheeran ;)

 
3) FILM FESTIVAL ENTRY FEES
 
We will shoot the film in January 2020, in time for summer start of the film's festival journey. 
As with my previous films which reached wide audiences globally, my plan for Debutante is to reach as many film festivals as possible, as well as to have it broadcast on RTÉ and other TV networks globally, US cable network ShortsHD, and available for viewing on board of Aer Lingus transatlantic flights. To start with. ;)

Film Crew Background
In early 2015, when I was shooting my first film, Testimony, I didn't really have much of a clue what I was doing. I made it happen through obsessive perseverance. 
Testimony screened in festivals globally and was nominated for multiple awards, including:


IMDb's New Filmmaker Award @ Bath Film Festival, UK

Best Director @ the BAFTA-qualifying Underwire Film Festival London


Best Screenplay & Rising Star Award @ Underground Cinema Awards, Dublin

My second short film, The Betrayal, featuring music by Nick Cave & Warren Ellis, premiered at the prestigious GAZE International LGBT Film Festival in Dublin, and screened at festivals in Ireland and Canada.

Both films were broadcast on Irish national TV (RTÉ) and The Irish Times recently included The Betrayal on the list of the week's best TV shows.
 

 
I'm also lucky - and grateful - to be surrounded by a wonderfully talented team on this project, including:

Barry Doyle, Director of Photography. Barry shot sci-fi pilot Rising, critically-acclaimed commercials for Focus Ireland (including I Can't Sleep), music videos and multiple short films. He has extensive experience in various camera departments on productions including Game of Thrones, Handsome Devil, Taken Down, Dark Lies The Island, and Sweetness in the Belly. Click on the video below for an example of Barry's intricate, beautiful cinematography.
 

 

Niall Owens, 1st Assistant Director, with many years of experience on short & feature drama, including multi-award-winning Michael Inside and upcoming feature Here Are The Young Men by Eoin Macken. Niall is also an IFTA-nominated producer, writer and director.
 

 

Gwen Jeffares, Costume Designer. Gwen collaborated with me on two of my films: on Testimony (for which she received a Best Costume Design nomination at the Underground Cinema Awards, Ireland) and on The Betrayal. She has extensive experience on short & feature films, including the award-winning shorts Gridlock and Five Letters to the Stranger Who Will Dissect My Brain. 
 

 

Edwina Kelly, Make Up Artist. Edwina's tremendous experience includes films like Calm With Horses (starring Barry Keoghan), Irish productions Taken Down, Black '47 and The Lodgers, to name a few.

<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1569905768/dza5svkqpngfltzcz21a.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We are looking to raise $3,700. Wowza. That's a lotta quiche. Well, Alfred Hitchcock did say, ""Make the audience suffer as much as possible,"" so we're just following in the footsteps of the master. But seriously, we are making a professional film so we are working with professionals which requires real professional type budgets. We are scheduled to shoot three days in November at a beautiful home in beautiful Burbank, CA. The majority of the budget will be going to our groovy crew to make sure this short film gets made correctly and to our magnificent cast since no one really liked my sock puppet idea.  The rest of the budget will be going to make sure our equipment actually works, making sure our insurance keeps cast and crew covered, and making sure no one starves.</p>
<p>Post production (the part that happens after filming, Mom) is also factored into this budget. Once the camera stops rolling, there is a surprising amount of work that still needs to be done. The movie will need to be colored to ensure it looks great, the sound will be mixed and scored so the film will sound appealing to your ears, and the short will need to be edited so you don't have to watch 10 hours of raw footage (that's our silly editors job). </p>
<h3>Exhibition Plan</h3>
<p>Where do you even watch a short film like this? After the film is complete, Patrick will submit the project to various genre and short film focused film festivals (Eat it, Sundance) like Fantastic Fest, Screamfest, and Hollywood Comedy Shorts Film Festival in hopes of being chosen and winning awards (That's why we do it, right?). From there, we are hoping to gain prestige and hype for the project, get people talking about it, and then release the film online for all to see. In addition, our main objective for this project is and always will be to bring an original story with new and interesting characters to the screen, but we are also hoping this short will become a ""proof of concept"" for a feature length film and potentially inspire someone with lots of money to let us make this into a real-life movie that anyone can see in a real-life movie theater. How neat would that be? </p>

<p>Contributors fund ideas they can be passionate about and to people they trust. Here are some things to do in this section:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are 128 Productions. Chris and Collin have been making short films together for five years in pursuit of a career in film making.</li>
<li>Revelation is the last installment in a series of Post Apocalyptic short films that Chris and Collin have been working on for the past two years. In 2018 we started this story and we want to be able to finish it in the best way we can.</li>
<li>With the help of all our backers we will be able to bring the story of Revelation to it's full potential.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>The main part of the campaign will go towards the gear and talent.</li>
<li>All of our gear can be found on LensRentals website. We will be renting from May 16th until May 26th which will bring our total to almost $2,000.</li>
<li>Another $1,000 will be going towards paying our talent.</li>
<li>The last $1,000 of the budget will be going towards location expenses, travel and lodging, food, wardrobe for the characters, and any other miscellaneous items we may need along the way.</li>
<li>Your donations to our film would mean everything to us! Our perks range from social media shout outs to signed memorabilia!</li>
<li>In the end, if we aren't able to reach our goal all the money will still go into supporting the project. Most of it will go towards our two main concerns, gear and talent.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Revelation is our biggest project yet and with that comes bigger challenges than we have faced in the past. Our biggest challenges for this project would be Time Management and Action Set Pieces.</p>
<ul>
<li>These are new obstacles that we haven't faced before but we believe we can take them head on with your help.</li>
<li>Time Management will greatly benefit from having two cameras on set. This will help knock out more shots throughout the day while also giving us the ability to take our time and not rush between takes.</li>
<li>Action Set pieces of this size aren't something we have done in the past so Chris and Collin will be bringing in some help with some intense hand to hand fight choreography.</li>

<p><u><strong>Short Summary:</strong></u></p>
<p>Hi, I’m Peter Barton, an award-winning filmmaker, and 3-time cancer survivor. As I approach my 80th year, in the wake of a global pandemic, I’m turning my attention to Final Chapters. This project, Brief Candle, is essentially a meditation on death, seen through the lens of a therapist who’s come to specialize in treating people with grim diagnoses.</p>
<p>This is going to be an intense experience, charged with joy and anguish, unfolding in the shadow of the pandemic. </p>
<p>I believe I’m prepared. I’ve taught film at NYU with Marty Scorsese.   Oliver Stone was a student. My work has appeared on Showtime, HBO, WNET, and WCBS. I founded the umbrella for this production, not-for-profit Groundswell Media, with documentary legend, George Stoney, dedicated to amplifying the voices of the disadvantaged. </p>
<p>My recent film, Women of ’69, Unboxed, has been shown on ninety percent of local PBS stations and received top prize at the Queens World Festival and the NYC Indie Festival, as well as a special audience award at the Woods Hole Festival. </p>
<p>I am very proud to have two films in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art.</p>
<p>Our cameras will begin our journey by following women at Camp Mak-A-Dream in Goldcreek, Montana. This session is reserved for women with ovarian cancer, a disease that is very hard to beat. With an average mortality rate of nearly 70%, these women are facing a very shaky future. </p>
<p>My guide on this extraordinary journey is Vivien Weiss, a therapist who over the years, because of her frustrating personal experience with the death of her mother, has come to specialize in accompanying women, over 50 of them to date, on their final journeys. This year, feeling the shadow of the COVID-19 epidemic over her shoulder, Vivien’s work has become increasingly relevant, both at the camp and in her private psychotherapy practice in Northampton, Mass. </p>
<p>Brief Candle will dissolve our instinctive denial and get viewers thinking about their own final chapters. It should engender sobering reflection and intense empathy since, after all, every one of us will one day walk that same Valley of the Shadow…</p>
<p>We invite you to screen our five-minute preview of the film here: <a href=""https://youtu.be/qQXBRHlZVRs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://youtu.be/qQXBRHlZVRs</a> </p>
<p>A personal message from myself can be viewed here: <a href=""https://youtu.be/bu6HJ8KdFeI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://youtu.be/bu6HJ8KdFeI</a></p> <p><u><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</strong></u></p>
<p>Filming will include a 9-week production and editing schedule with 6 days on location with Weiss in Montana plus sessions with her patients in Northampton.  A comprehensive budget can be found below. Your investment will provide the funding we need to create this unforgettable documentary.  We look forward to partnering with you. In return, we offer mailed gifts, film credits, therapy scessions, and most importantly, the satisfaction of having contributed to a profound, legacy-building project. </p>

But it has not extinguished their fiery spirits. They hoot at the fading moon, salute the rising sun with prayers and sighs.  Their joy surges, heightened by the fact that this may be their last howl.

Viv lives in Northampton, but, because of her special expertise and experience, comes to Montana twice a year to minister to this special population. She’s done this for 16 years.</p>
<p>Viv tells us that the spirit and tone of the camp is FAR from morose. She does individual and group sessions there, helping the women deal with their concerns for their families as well as for their own final paths.  There is heartbreak in abundance, but also lots of love and laughter. </p>

They look back on their lives, especially in individual therapy sessions, and, with Viv's help, find a perspective that may not be sunny, but is steady, both firm and affirming.

</div></div>","Short Summary:
Hi, I’m Peter Barton, an award-winning filmmaker, and 3-time cancer survivor. As I approach my 80th year, in the wake of a global pandemic, I’m turning my attention to Final Chapters. This project, Brief Candle, is essentially a meditation on death, seen through the lens of a therapist who’s come to specialize in treating people with grim diagnoses.
This is going to be an intense experience, charged with joy and anguish, unfolding in the shadow of the pandemic. 
I believe I’m prepared. I’ve taught film at NYU with Marty Scorsese.   Oliver Stone was a student. My work has appeared on Showtime, HBO, WNET, and WCBS. I founded the umbrella for this production, not-for-profit Groundswell Media, with documentary legend, George Stoney, dedicated to amplifying the voices of the disadvantaged. 
My recent film, Women of ’69, Unboxed, has been shown on ninety percent of local PBS stations and received top prize at the Queens World Festival and the NYC Indie Festival, as well as a special audience award at the Woods Hole Festival. 
I am very proud to have two films in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art.
Our cameras will begin our journey by following women at Camp Mak-A-Dream in Goldcreek, Montana. This session is reserved for women with ovarian cancer, a disease that is very hard to beat. With an average mortality rate of nearly 70%, these women are facing a very shaky future. 
My guide on this extraordinary journey is Vivien Weiss, a therapist who over the years, because of her frustrating personal experience with the death of her mother, has come to specialize in accompanying women, over 50 of them to date, on their final journeys. This year, feeling the shadow of the COVID-19 epidemic over her shoulder, Vivien’s work has become increasingly relevant, both at the camp and in her private psychotherapy practice in Northampton, Mass. 
Brief Candle will dissolve our instinctive denial and get viewers thinking about their own final chapters. It should engender sobering reflection and intense empathy since, after all, every one of us will one day walk that same Valley of the Shadow…

Original Music - Sometimes that perfect song just makes the film.
Festival Submissions - What's the point in making a film if you can't get it out to the world?
Editing, Colour - The film is made on set but completed in the edit!
Our incredible team includes top notch editor & colourist. 



 
 


 
Our biggest risk is the stunts we have - but not to worry, we have a kickass stunt coordinator helping us choreograph and safely film all the action sequences in this film. 
The key action sequence is the brawl between Isiah and Clark, the bodyguard, which takes place in Simon Silver's Office. To pull this off to the highest level of competency, we will be ensuring all necessary safety precautions are taken, we conduct sufficient rehearsals to get the action right and have our stunt coordinator supervise the sequences while we film it.

<h2>Yermo's Story </h2>
<p>When discussing Watsonville murals and muralists one name is widely referenced amongst many, and that name is <a href=""https://www.yermoaztlan.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Guillermo Aranda </a>or Yermo. Yermo creates his murals through an inclusive community process that involves mentoring young children and adults who want to learn and assist with painting. Those who attend not only learn about the skills and techniques behind large-scale murals, but they also learn about the rich culture and history that inspired each character and symbol that lives within the mural. Yermo’s murals act as a mirror and a vibrant visual archive of the surrounding area, reminding us where we are and where we've been. </p>
<p>This past year Yermo was awarded Artist of the Year by the Santa Cruz County Arts Commission. Unfortunately, due to the pandemic, the commission was unable to host a celebration in honor of Yermo's artistry, mentorship, and impact. And just recently his mural at Watsonville High School was removed. He is now in the process of repainting the original mural, and will be inviting the group of painters who participated nearly 20 years ago. </p>
<p>We want to bring Yermo's story to you through a short documentary film that will showcase his hard work and dedication to the arts, his community, and his cultura. We will be working with <a href=""http://calavera.media"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Calavera Media</a> to create this project.</p> <h2>Project Budget</h2>
<p>We need your support raising funding to help us create a short documentary film about Yermo's story. Your contributions will go towards the following:</p>
<p><strong>Pre-Production [$630.00]</strong></p>
<p>This is where we will be developing the road map to the film! The team will interview Yermo and Paul to start structuring the story. We want to make sure that we are creating an interesting, impactful, and visually appealing film. After, our team will develop a pitch deck that will give a visual example as to what the film will appear as. Once the pitch deck is ready, the Producer will be setting up interviews, and securing times to film during production. </p>
<p><strong>Production [$2420.00]</strong></p>
<p>This is where the magic happens! The crew will come onto location over a span of 32 hours to start capturing interviews and footage for the film.</p>
<p><strong>Post-Production [$2225.00]</strong></p>
<p>Our post-production team kicks in to shape the story, handle color-correction, record any voice overs, clean up the audio, add music, and create graphics for the film. </p>
<p><strong>Distribution [$390.00]</strong></p>
<p>Once the film is complete we will be submitting it to several film festivals. We want to share Yermo's story with as many people across the U.S. as possible. </p> <p><i>Additional funds raised will go towards compensating Yermo, promoting the short film, submitting the short film into film festivals, creating merchandise, and any additional costs that may arise.  </i></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi everyone! I am an award-winning filmmaker with a passion to tell black stories outside of stereotypical narratives.  Our campaign, Blue Night, tells the story of Ebony, a conflicted girl who must confront the police officer that murdered her brother. As a contributor, you will help with the filming budget, marketing budget and pursuit of telling authentic black stories!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1629356832/cvfruetzqskt1ojwxnjs.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As a filmmaker, my priority is to tell compelling black narratives outside of the stereotypical lens (slave/gangster/etc). Blue Night is telling an intimate perspective of black families that do not have a clear path after experiencing pain with police brutality.</p>

<p>Our last tv pilot, <i>Vessel</i>, tells the story of Benjamin, a black screenwriter attempting to pitch his black story to the white-dominant entertainment industry, and extra-terrestrials make it that much harder. <i>Vessel</i> was selected into 13 film festivals worldwide, won 3 and received a non-exclusive distribution deal with P.Diddy’s television network, Revolt TV. With $5,000 saved and a dedicated small crew, we were able to accomplish a lot. With your help, we would like to make an even bigger impact!</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Hi everyone! I am an award-winning filmmaker with a passion to tell black stories outside of stereotypical narratives.  Our campaign, Blue Night, tells the story of Ebony, a conflicted girl who must confront the police officer that murdered her brother. As a contributor, you will help with the filming budget, marketing budget and pursuit of telling authentic black stories!

 

The Impact
As a filmmaker, my priority is to tell compelling black narratives outside of the stereotypical lens (slave/gangster/etc). Blue Night is telling an intimate perspective of black families that do not have a clear path after experiencing pain with police brutality.



Our last tv pilot, Vessel, tells the story of Benjamin, a black screenwriter attempting to pitch his black story to the white-dominant entertainment industry, and extra-terrestrials make it that much harder. Vessel was selected into 13 film festivals worldwide, won 3 and received a non-exclusive distribution deal with P.Diddy’s television network, Revolt TV. With $5,000 saved and a dedicated small crew, we were able to accomplish a lot. With your help, we would like to make an even bigger impact!

 
 
Budget
This is the part every creative filmmaker hates talking about but we are keeping it entirely transparent with all of you. Here is a projected breakdown of Production & Post-Production:
 
Rental Equipment - $2,500.00
Director - $1,000.00
Production Manager - $1,750.00
Director of Photography - $1,000.00
Gaffer - $600.00
Sound - $600.00
DIT - $500.00
Hair & MUA (makeup artist) - $500.00
P.A. - $200.00 
Craft Services - $250.00
Props - $1,350
Contingency - $500.00
Insurance - $1,000.00
Location - $2,000.00
Location Permit - $800.00---
POST-PRODUCTION SERVICES (editing, sound mixing, etc.) - $1,500.00
Post-Production Colorist - $1,000.00
Storage - $600.00
 
TOTAL:
$ 17,650

Hello! 
I am Matthew Quek, a Singaporean singer-songwriter, executive movie producer, actor, Special Education Needs (SEN) Counsellor and Educator.
I have invisible Special Education Needs (SEN) which were only diagnosed during my National Service after going through much trauma, isolation and discrimination throughout much of my school life.
Short Film Project
We aim to produce a meaningful and impactful short film entitled ""Essentially Yours"", and we appeal for your support to realise this project.
This film will be based on a first-person portrayal of the life of an individual with autism/ASD/Asperger's and multiple special needs living during the COVID-19 lockdown phase, featuring especially, the struggles his caregivers face in the midst of unemployment, retrenchment, discrimination and mental health challenges.
 
Although largely fictitious in nature, it will be based on real-life accounts of such individuals
What We Need 
This film project has already been officially supported and granted partial funding by MCCY (Ministry of Culture, Community & Youth) via the OSF (Our Singapore Fund). We are immensely thankful for their support and endorsement.

However, in order to realise this vision, we need to raise an additional $30k for the project.
 
We hope to produce and release this movie during the first half of 2021 as we would like to bring greater awareness to the difficult reality of those living with such challenges daily.
Achieving the Vision with YOUR Help
We hope to inspire children and youths with SEN to invest their efforts and time to produce and showcase their artistic works and areas of talent.
 
Our desire is to see children and youths with SEN meaningfully integrated into Singaporean society, whether at school, work or play.
 
Through this project and your kind financial support, we hope to be ambassadors for those who need a voice and have flown under the radar in our society for a long time.
 
This project is intended to be a springboard from which others may step up as fellow ambassadors for those who may face similar challenges, and feel isolated and discouraged in our society.
 
Together, we aim to play our part in a collective effort of ensuring that future generations of Singaporeans would be able to truly enjoy being immersed in a genuinely-inclusive nation. 
 
Additional Information
“It takes a village to raise a child”, it is often said, but it takes a lot more for those with special needs.
 
Nonetheless, with the right hearts of love, empathy, kindness, compassion and perseverance, the most daunting of odds can be overcome together.
 
Life can be meaningful and purposeful because of the right hearts, right people and right platforms working towards the same goal of genuine inclusivity.
 
This film and corresponding theme song could be used by various Special Education Organisations as a tool to enable special needs individuals to healthily integrate into school life, work life and other aspects of social interaction without an unhealthy fear of bullying, rejection and discrimination. This will complement the country’s efforts to rise above this crisis and galvanise one another for collective recovery and hope for the future.
 

This work will subtly highlight the recent initiatives of Skills Future, re-skilling and employment, in tandem with community togetherness in forging a social glue that will ensure that we, as a nation and society, arise from this crisis stronger, empathetic and much more resilient.

I am the Co-Writer, Producer, Casting Director, and Lead Actor in Zemblanity. I have always loved movies and working with people who are as passionate about this art form as I am. I started studying film when I was put into film class by my amazing mother when I was in 5th grade. I graduated from the Pacific Conservatory of the Performing Arts in 2017 and have been studying acting in LA ever since. In the past, I have been a main stage performer for Disney Cruise Line, played Cornelius in Hello Dolly, Gabe in Next to Normal and Davey in Lieutenant of Inishmore. Most of the work that I usually do is in theatre, so in 2020 my main industry stopped. I decided to put matters into my own hands and get back to my film roots. I called one of my best friends, Spencer Mead, who is an incredible director and storyteller and said, “We have to make a film!” </p><p>Spencer Mead is the Co-Writer, Director, and Editor of Zemblanity. He has written, directed, and produced many films, commercials, and music videos over the years. He graduated from London FIlm Academy as well as studied at Berkeley Digital Film Institute. Altogether, he has been making films for years the most recent of which, FLUX, received a Best Director and Best Editor award and can be viewed on YouTube. I have had the pleasure of getting to work with him on multiple occasions prior to this project. </p><p>It is always a pleasure and he consistently puts out an incredible final product! I wanted us to make something that we could both put our creative energies into. Together we invested our own money to create a film we both could be proud of. This has cemented our collaborative partnership, and we already have plans for our next film, which you can learn more about below!</p><p> </p><p><u><strong>What is the campaign for? </strong></u></p><p>We are raising money for two main purposes:</p><p>1) To get this film out to festivals</p><p>2) Offer you an opportunity to support the making of this film by helping us fund it.</p><p>Festivals are a huge part of indie filmmaking. Your donation will help us get people to see our work and make a name for ourselves in this industry. Getting this funding is HUGE! </p><p>Almost every film festival has a cost of entry to submit a film and some even have additional costs once you are in. So, we are setting the goal of $500 for festival submissions alone. These costs can range from $15 to $75 per submission, per festival. </p><p>The production of this film cost us just under $6,000. Making films at this level takes creativity and not a dime goes to waste whether that’s the travel expenses, equipment, permits, or the hiring of any of the numerous artists that it takes to create a movie. </p><p>In setting out to do this film it was important to us that everyone who worked on this project was an artist whose creative voices could contribute to our story and that we paid them fairly to do so. From our local steadicam operator to our international composer we’ve strove to find unique artists and are proud of the team we’ve put together.</p><p>If, at the end of the day, we don’t reach our full goal, whatever money we do raise will go toward getting this film out to festivals. Again, festivals are our chance to showcase the film, get exposure, make contacts, and sometimes find opportunities for larger fundraising to create feature films, tv pilots, and more.</p><p> </p><p><u><strong>What do I get for my donation?</strong></u></p><p>Well, I am so glad you asked! </p><p>For our generous donors and here is what you can expect:</p><p>$5 - A downloadable link to the film sent to you when it is released </p><p>$10 - Early access to the film! Consider this your virtual ticket to a early screening of the film (up to 6 months to a year before its public release) </p><p>$20 - <i>Thank You Credit</i>, Your name will be in the movie!</p><p>$30 - A downloadable mp3 of the score </p><p>$50 - A downloadable link to the movie poster (with a personalized thank you email)</p><p>$100 - A special thank you video message from the creators!</p><p>$150 - A signed script from the writers </p><p>$200 - A full-sized movie poster</p><p>$500 - <i>Sponsor Credit</i>, with a letter detailing the miracles from the day of our shoot.</p><p>Producers and Executive Producers get a “cocktail hour” with the creators of the film and will be provided themed drinks shipped to you directly for a Zoom Kiki! </p><p>$1000 - <i>Producer Credit</i>, your name will appear with our Producers as one important cog in helping us get this movie made. This can also be a place for businesses, corporate sponsors, and persons to be recognized. </p><p>$5000 - <i>Executive Producer Credit</i> (this includes the absolute top billing, set passes to our next film, and an opportunity for a Cameo!) </p><p>To receive thank you gifts from our team, please make sure to leave your full name and email address so we can contact you and make sure you get the full credit you deserve! </p><p>No matter what you give, your support is what makes these projects go and it allows us to continue making them!</p><p> </p><p><u><strong>What happens if we exceed our goal?</strong></u></p><p>Spencer and I have created a production company and are continuing to make many more films into the future. We have already begun pre-production on our next  short film “Gambling Addicts” set to shoot in June, and we are writing a feature length script we hope to begin production on next year. So, any donations that go beyond this goal will go towards our continued mission of producing entertaining and original films while supporting the teams of creative voices that make them possible. Whether it’s hiring a crew, renting equipment, paying for locations, craft services, costuming/props, housing, travel expenses, music rights, editors, or visual effects;  Movies can cost a lot!!! (like 6,000 exclamation points a lot!) So no money will go to waste!</p><p> </p><p><u><strong>What difference does it make?</strong></u></p><p>Getting public funding for this project makes a huge difference! This money affirms support for us as up-and-coming filmmakers. It eases the financial burden on us. It allows us to focus our energy more on our art form rather than our pocketbooks. We live in a day and age where art is vital to our society. Art has not only been for entertainment this last year, but it has been how the world has been able to cope. We need stories and storytellers now more than ever. Whether it be to let us escape into another world, make us nostalgic, bring us joy and laughter, let us cry, or make us reflect and start a conversation, we need art.</p><p>Stories whether it’s film or theater are what I think of as “empathy pills in a 2-hour capsule”. These mediums can be used as the best way to teach people to care for one another. Think of the stories and movies that shaped who you are. We all want a love that would rival The Notebook and a home that Dorothy’s ruby slippers would know in their soles.</p><p>At the end of the day, this is what I love to do. You are supporting me. You are supporting Spencer. You are supporting every artist that we have chosen and will choose to bring on our team to create with. I truly appreciate every donation that is made. There is no number that is too small or too big that will not be seen and felt. </p><p> </p><p>If you aren’t in a position to support us financially, you can still help us out by spreading the word! Tell your friends about us and our creative endeavors! Be LOUD and make some noise about supporting the arts. It’s super easy. Just use the Indiegogo share tool and let your voice be heard! Thank you!</p></div>","Z E M B L A N I T Y  Who are we?Hello! My name is Trevor March. I am the Co-Writer, Producer, Casting Director, and Lead Actor in Zemblanity.

Altogether, he has been making films for years the most recent of which, FLUX, received a Best Director and Best Editor award and can be viewed on YouTube. I have had the pleasure of getting to work with him on multiple occasions prior to this project. It is always a pleasure and he consistently puts out an incredible final product! I wanted us to make something that we could both put our creative energies into. Together we invested our own money to create a film we both could be proud of. This has cemented our collaborative partnership, and we already have plans for our next film, which you can learn more about below! What is the campaign for? We are raising money for two main purposes:1) To get this film out to festivals2) Offer you an opportunity to support the making of this film by helping us fund it.Festivals are a huge part of indie filmmaking. Your donation will help us get people to see our work and make a name for ourselves in this industry. Getting this funding is HUGE! Almost every film festival has a cost of entry to submit a film and some even have additional costs once you are in. So, we are setting the goal of $500 for festival submissions alone. These costs can range from $15 to $75 per submission, per festival. The production of this film cost us just under $6,000. Making films at this level takes creativity and not a dime goes to waste whether that’s the travel expenses, equipment, permits, or the hiring of any of the numerous artists that it takes to create a movie. In setting out to do this film it was important to us that everyone who worked on this project was an artist whose creative voices could contribute to our story and that we paid them fairly to do so. From our local steadicam operator to our international composer we’ve strove to find unique artists and are proud of the team we’ve put together.If, at the end of the day, we don’t reach our full goal, whatever money we do raise will go toward getting this film out to festivals. Again, festivals are our chance to showcase the film, get exposure, make contacts, and sometimes find opportunities for larger fundraising to create feature films, tv pilots, and more. What do I get for my donation?Well, I am so glad you asked! For our generous donors and here is what you can expect:$5 - A downloadable link to the film sent to you when it is released $10 - Early access to the film! Consider this your virtual ticket to a early screening of the film (up to 6 months to a year before its public release) $20 - Thank You Credit, Your name will be in the movie!$30 - A downloadable mp3 of the score $50 - A downloadable link to the movie poster (with a personalized thank you email)$100 - A special thank you video message from the creators!$150 - A signed script from the writers $200 - A full-sized movie poster$500 - Sponsor Credit, with a letter detailing the miracles from the day of our shoot.Producers and Executive Producers get a “cocktail hour” with the creators of the film and will be provided themed drinks shipped to you directly for a Zoom Kiki! $1000 - Producer Credit, your name will appear with our Producers as one important cog in helping us get this movie made. This can also be a place for businesses, corporate sponsors, and persons to be recognized. $5000 - Executive Producer Credit (this includes the absolute top billing, set passes to our next film, and an opportunity for a Cameo!) To receive thank you gifts from our team, please make sure to leave your full name and email address so we can contact you and make sure you get the full credit you deserve! No matter what you give, your support is what makes these projects go and it allows us to continue making them! What happens if we exceed our goal?Spencer and I have created a production company and are continuing to make many more films into the future. We have already begun pre-production on our next  short film “Gambling Addicts” set to shoot in June, and we are writing a feature length script we hope to begin production on next year. So, any donations that go beyond this goal will go towards our continued mission of producing entertaining and original films while supporting the teams of creative voices that make them possible. Whether it’s hiring a crew, renting equipment, paying for locations, craft services, costuming/props, housing, travel expenses, music rights, editors, or visual effects;  Movies can cost a lot!!! (like 6,000 exclamation points a lot!) So no money will go to waste! What difference does it make?Getting public funding for this project makes a huge difference! This money affirms support for us as up-and-coming filmmakers. It eases the financial burden on us. It allows us to focus our energy more on our art form rather than our pocketbooks. We live in a day and age where art is vital to our society. Art has not only been for entertainment this last year, but it has been how the world has been able to cope. We need stories and storytellers now more than ever. Whether it be to let us escape into another world, make us nostalgic, bring us joy and laughter, let us cry, or make us reflect and start a conversation, we need art.Stories whether it’s film or theater are what I think of as “empathy pills in a 2-hour capsule”. These mediums can be used as the best way to teach people to care for one another. Think of the stories and movies that shaped who you are. We all want a love that would rival The Notebook and a home that Dorothy’s ruby slippers would know in their soles.At the end of the day, this is what I love to do. You are supporting me. You are supporting Spencer. You are supporting every artist that we have chosen and will choose to bring on our team to create with. I truly appreciate every donation that is made. There is no number that is too small or too big that will not be seen and felt.  If you aren’t in a position to support us financially, you can still help us out by spreading the word! Tell your friends about us and our creative endeavors! Be LOUD and make some noise about supporting the arts. It’s super easy. Just use the Indiegogo share tool and let your voice be heard!

<p>Hello! I am a film student at the University of North Alabama. I am working on my senior thesis project. This film is the culmination of everything I have learned.

<p>I am Australia Kincannon, the Director, Producer and award-winning Writer of the feature film “BOUND,” a crime and horror thriller currently in pre-production. This film genre is my “go-to” when it comes to movie night. There is just something about it that draws me in more than any other genre.</p>

<p>Over the years I’ve had many jobs—Costume Designer and Creator (still active), Fire Fighter, Alaskan Fisher, Retail, Car Salesperson, and so on—but working in film has been by far the wildest ride I’ve ever experienced.</p>
<p>I have been working on this feature film since 2019, with several awards already for the screenplay, and now it is time this piece of cinema actually gets made. Though the story is not a ""feel good"" or inspirational story, it doesn’t make it any less worthy of being created. It tackles loss, grief, rage, depression, substance abuse, isolation, mental illness, morality, and more—issues that mean so much to me and have come to the forefront in recent years.</p>
<p>What do I see for this film, why it should be created, and why should YOU care?  I will work my ass off to make this the best film it could possibly be with the ultra-low budget I am asking for. I will have real representation on screen, not glamorized Hollywood standards. In addition, with it being filmed here in the Pacific Northwest, it will offer the opportunity for local talent—including your family and friends, maybe even you—to be on screen and behind the cameras to experience working on something you love without having to uproot to Los Angeles or work for free on projects that never hit their full potential due to lack of funding. We all want the chance at our dream jobs; it shouldn't always get to be just a lucky few.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This project is currently in pre-production, but to reach production (actually filming the movie) and achieve the quality it needs to be to make it worth everyone’s while, there needs to be funding. <br/>The goal for this production is at least $100,000. If you’re thinking that is low for a feature film, you're absolutely right. Most films are in the millions, even Indie films are mostly around $500 thousand to several million dollars. With $100,000 that gives the local people enough interest to be passionate enough to make this the best it can be.</p>
<p>Together with crowdfunding, we are also approaching investors non-stop and working other avenues of funding. There can be no limit when it comes to something this big and important. </p>
<p>The graph below shows approximately how funds will be disbursed throughout the project.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622499175/yqjziqypr9oni5azhokh.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In exchange for donations outside of standard donating and investors, there will be many perks to choose from: film posters, digital copies of the film (once completed), physical DVD copies, and additional BOUND-related merch.</p>
<p>There will also be RARE opportunities for (certified) autographed items by major film celebrities and a chance to grab a SPEAKING ROLE in the movie! I encourage you to follow the BOUND Facebook page for latest updates and reminders.  </p>

<p>Awards, limited unforeseen events, and other items have been budgeted into the overall funding.</p>
<p>If we don’t meet the $100,000 goal by the time filming begins in 2022, the feature will be pushed out until funds are reached, or—depending on how short we come up—we would still film the feature on time and make an additional drive for funds once we reach post-production.</p>
<p>Either way, I am confident this film will be completed. </p>
<p>Production is set to start in February 2022 and post-production is slated to be finished by the fall of 2022 to hit the festival circuit and, eventually, distribution.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I am not exaggerating when I say I will exhaust every avenue to make sure this film goes as far as it can and be the best it can be! It’s only fair to the people involved and to me. </p>
<p>In donating and helping us reach the goal, you are ensuring paid jobs! If we can show the world that here in little Washington, we can make movies that people want to watch and be a part of, that’s huge! I think people would like to see someone like themselves in the movies, a little more real life; relatable faces, bodies (and I don't just mean the dead ones), breaking gender roles and racial and sexual stereotypes.</p>
<p>In donating and helping us reach our goal, you are ensuring paid local jobs! By showing the world that here in our little corner of the Pacific Northwest, we can make exciting movies that people want to watch and be a part of, it will continue to help boost the local film industry and put huge smiles on the faces of our local talent. People love to see someone like themselves in movies with a little more real life relatable faces and body types (and I don't just mean the dead ones) that break gender roles as well as racial and sexual stereotypes. This film will do just that! We will be bringing on talent, both in front of and behind the camera, with proper representation and inclusion.</p>
<p>The proof of concept video you see at the top of the page was filmed in four days on a budget of $2,600. The talent was amazing, and I could not have been happier with their performances. Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to return for the feature, and many characters and story plots were not included.</p>
<p>A huge reason funding needs to happen is so that this project is the best quality it can be by hiring talented individuals both on screen and off. The cast and crew are more dedicated and reliable when they are paid, and this also means better equipment at our disposal. I am confident that with the proper funding, this feature will be wonderfully done, and we will be proud to say ""this is ours.""</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Because there is no way to know what will happen at any time during the production, it is possible that an actor may need to be re-cast, someone on the crew may be unable to complete their behind-the-scenes duties, or a location may suddenly become unavailable. These are all things that can happen on a production. A scene may not go according to plan or work may need to be done in post because of something that wasn’t caught during filming. When things like this happen, we must work quickly to find a solution in that moment. We will have a team of creative minds at our disposal to troubleshoot these issues as they arise.</p>
<p>With your support, this would be a mostly, if not completely, paid gig and would make it easier to hire someone last minute if needed, secure a premium location, and handle other unforeseen circumstances. If we should have any problems, delays, or things beyond our control, we promise to always be open and direct with our contributors. I have high standards for what we are doing, and I am making the best preparations possible.</p>
<p>With the Indiegogo fully funded, it gives us less time to worry about money and more time working to make this movie the best that it can be, giving us options in case something does happen.  </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand if you don't have the money to help out at this time, but you can still make a huge difference by sharing the campaign, EXPLAINING to your family and friends why they should help in this adventure, and pitch in where possible. That costs nothing and means everything. No donation is too little, and every bit helps in the long run. So please, when you share this campaign, write something about it, and maybe pledge a donation in your post to generate interest. Perhaps you have a super cool item such as an celebrity autograph (with certificate of authenticity) you can donate as a perk to help us reach our goal, or volunteer to be on set! There are so many ways you can donate and help us reach our goal.<br/>Your support has been overwhelming to say the least. Thank you so much and see you at the movies, my friends!</p>

If we can show the world that here in little Washington, we can make movies that people want to watch and be a part of, that’s huge! I think people would like to see someone like themselves in the movies, a little more real life; relatable faces, bodies (and I don't just mean the dead ones), breaking gender roles and racial and sexual stereotypes.
In donating and helping us reach our goal, you are ensuring paid local jobs! By showing the world that here in our little corner of the Pacific Northwest, we can make exciting movies that people want to watch and be a part of, it will continue to help boost the local film industry and put huge smiles on the faces of our local talent. People love to see someone like themselves in movies with a little more real life relatable faces and body types (and I don't just mean the dead ones) that break gender roles as well as racial and sexual stereotypes. This film will do just that! We will be bringing on talent, both in front of and behind the camera, with proper representation and inclusion.
The proof of concept video you see at the top of the page was filmed in four days on a budget of $2,600. The talent was amazing, and I could not have been happier with their performances. Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to return for the feature, and many characters and story plots were not included.
A huge reason funding needs to happen is so that this project is the best quality it can be by hiring talented individuals both on screen and off. The cast and crew are more dedicated and reliable when they are paid, and this also means better equipment at our disposal. I am confident that with the proper funding, this feature will be wonderfully done, and we will be proud to say ""this is ours.""

Risks & Challenges
Because there is no way to know what will happen at any time during the production, it is possible that an actor may need to be re-cast, someone on the crew may be unable to complete their behind-the-scenes duties, or a location may suddenly become unavailable. These are all things that can happen on a production. A scene may not go according to plan or work may need to be done in post because of something that wasn’t caught during filming. When things like this happen, we must work quickly to find a solution in that moment. We will have a team of creative minds at our disposal to troubleshoot these issues as they arise.
With your support, this would be a mostly, if not completely, paid gig and would make it easier to hire someone last minute if needed, secure a premium location, and handle other unforeseen circumstances. If we should have any problems, delays, or things beyond our control, we promise to always be open and direct with our contributors. I have high standards for what we are doing, and I am making the best preparations possible.
With the Indiegogo fully funded, it gives us less time to worry about money and more time working to make this movie the best that it can be, giving us options in case something does happen.

</h3><p> </p><h3>The World</h3><p>America has changed. The old government was replaced by the World Alliance Council, a unified world order that oversees all governments across all countries on the planet.  In America the big cities have been walled off as to keep the populations of those cities contained and in tight nit control. Inside the cities people are subject to the class system dictated by the Council. People are not able to move up in society as they are all placed in their preassigned roles. Outside the cities are where the undesirables of this new regime are either banished to, or in many cases, escaped. In these lands beyond the walls lay all manner of people just trying to survive on the limited resources they have. Some small towns from the life before do still function as small villages and some semblance of civil pockets of humanity.

Luther does so by embracing a symbol feared in the lands known as The Black Rider.

And even if you can't do much that way, it would be super cool if you can share this campaign to let all your friends know about this fun project. God BlessRandy Kelly Jr (REK Films Montana)",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What is ""Giggles""?</h3>
<p>""Giggles"" is the tale of an unspeakable tragedy that befell a sleepy island town. Four years ago a man working as a clown went mad and brutally murdered the town folk. He somehow escaped the police and vanished without a trace. Recently, a new video has gone viral. People are saying it's cursed. Watching it supposedly alerts this same clown to your presence. Sounds standard enough as far as urban legends go, but the problem is; bodies have started piling up. Is this some sick joke by a copycat killer, or could the original murderer be back in town? Worse yet, something dark and unnatural seems to be at play... Could the curse actually be real?</p>

<h2>DUCK STORY</h2>
<p>Hi, We're Matt &amp; Alison, the creators of an exciting <strong><i>new</i></strong> children's illustrated book that we're offering YOU the opportunity of featuring in, and we're trying to raise aware and funds to turn it into an animated feature film!!</p>
<p><i><strong>In an inner-city park, Goldie, a grumpy duck detective, who works for the Pond Police, is on the hunt for a thief who’s been stealing ducklings. Goldie and his new, boisterous partner, young Manny the Mandarin duck, must work together to unravel the mystery with the help of the elite birds of prey team; the MI-DIVE…</strong></i></p>
<p>The book is about a Harpy eagle who comes to England and finds a beautiful park filled with an abundance of food and juicy ducklings, and the duck detectives who are searching for a missing duckling and swan prince. </p>
<p>The idea came from the hundreds of trips we've taken to Kelsey Park, a beautiful park in South-East London, but our story represents so many local parks all over the world.</p>

<p><strong>About the project:</strong></p>

<li>The park in the book is very diverse and features an abundance of wildlife including; Egyptian and Canadian Geese, Mandarin ducks, South Carolina Wood ducks, mallards, drakes, wood pigeons, tufted ducks, cats, rats, squirrels, etc. </li>
<li>Our campaign is important to us because we want to make people aware of the opportunities on their doorstep to connect with nature and to encourage them to seek out local wildlife spots.</li>
<li>Your contributions will help us to achieve our goal of bringing this story to life and sharing it with the world, including with various charities. </li>
<li>This is the first in a series of books and ultimately our biggest goal (and dream) is to turn it into an animated feature film for everyone!!</li>
</ul>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The finer detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need funding to pay for an editor for the book, a fantastic illustrator, and a team of social media and marketing experts to help us build awareness.</li>
<li>For every 5 E-books we sell we'll donate 1 free E-book to a children's charity or other charity.</li>
<li>We have some wonderfully unique perks such as the e-book itself, signed postcards &amp; posters, as well as the exciting opportunity to feature in the book yourself:<ul>

<h3>Dead By The Sea</h3>
<p>When two, young adults discover the fateful passing of their close companion, their dreams are hurt as they come to terms with the idea of moving on without them. George and Erik face their fears and emotions as teenagers in a bitter coming of age film, triggered by their classmate’s dead body found by the sea.</p>
<p>George and Erik huddle together for warmth, as the sirens of the police deafen them both. The blinding lights accentuate the harsh waves. The hostile weather accentuates the vulnerability of the young men as their thoughts begin to cloud them and they become more opinionated. Huddled on the beach, they both reflect on how they could disappear, in what felt like a blink of an eye. They come to terms with growing up and eventually moving away. As the body is dragged from the water. The paramedics swarm the limp body.</p>
<p>The young men sit on the sand, but as the continue to watch the uncomfortable scene in front of them. They argue about responsibility, but it feels as though the shared responsibility is something they never expected from their newly changed status from teenagers to young adults.</p>
<h3>Who Am I?</h3>
<p>A Finnish/British filmmaker who is currently studying at the University for the Creative Arts. I am currently studying for a complete certification in AVID Media Composer Training, as well as broadening my on-set capabilities to be harnessed in the professional work-space. This includes the under-taking of multiple ideas and project development. I am currently the Assisstant Director to our latest project, 'Dead By The Sea' as well as the editor.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our biggest risks include budgeting, especially as we initially hope to be able to travel to these locations with the majority of our crew. </p>
<p>Given the current coronavirus situation, unfortunately we will not be able to stay in local residence, and community to the filming locations is far more expensive. </p>
<p>Our expectation is to make a beautiful film in which we can use our filmmaking knowledge to create something which we want you all to be proud of.</p>
<p>We will need a minimum of £500 to help keep this project afloat, to make sure that we are able to keep the props available as well as additional travel expenses-especially as we are transporting a crew of 10 on most days for 4 days.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project is extremely treasured by our group, as it expresses many of the coming of age films in which friendship helps establish bonds outside of understanding.</p>

underway.  We have all of the funds we need for final sound mix, color correction, and our original musical score.  Almost everything we need is there.  BUT, during the process of editing the film, we noticed that there was something extremely vital missing.  Enongo herself is a fantastic orator and storyteller, but many essential anecdotes and experiences in her life were absent from our narrative on a cinematic level.  We had little visual record of her past in the way we needed, and no way of visually showing what is going on inside her mind.  Thus, <strong>we realized how to bring those separate but crucial chapters of her journey to life: <i>through animation</i>.</strong></p><p><br/>While the film mostly follows our protagonist with contemporary footage of her performing across North America, in the intimacy of her home, and behind-the-scenes access of the artist creating her next album, we are also producing over ten minutes of original, frame-by-frame, hand-drawn animation — conceived, designed, storyboarded, and brought to life by a team of eight young, Black women animators across the country — which will help tell Enongo's story.  These animation sequences will shed light on Enongo's complicated upbringing as a child of West-African immigrants living in mostly-white Upstate New York, her battles with mental health, how the feminist icon of video game heroine Samus Aran inspired her, and other key aspects of her narrative.  The animation not only fills in the narrative gaps, but expands the experience of the viewer, making a more engaging, creatively-satisfying, and moving work of cinematic storytelling.</p><p> </p><p>The animation style will embrace the tradition of hand-drawn ""pencil tests,” showing the artistry of the animators’ craft and personal visions behind the drawings in each frame.  Each sequence will have a unique aesthetic to it, as well, with each animation artist cast to scenes that will exemplify her vision and creative strengths.  This will also be the very first feature-length film of any genre in which all of the animators are Black women. All of our storyboards are timed as animatics, and rough animation is already underway.  <strong>Now, we just need to bring all of these drawings to life.</strong></p><p> </p><p>Making a feature-length documentary is a lot of work and very expensive.  Making a very good, polished feature-length documentary shown around the world with lots of original, hand-drawn animation is even more work and is even more expensive.</p><p> </p><p><strong>This is where <i>you</i> come in.</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>By reaching our minimum goal of at least $20,000 (and hopefully surpassing it!), we will use those funds to finish roughing out, drawing, and clean-up on our amazing animation sequences. </strong> If we can surpass that goal, we hope to use additional funds on any essential animation backgrounds, shading, and other elements.  </p><p>Enongo's story is relatable, universal, and deeply moving.  <i><strong>How this story is told, and by whom, is what makes this movie really special...</strong></i></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><img

and based on their aesthetic sensibilities and skill sets.  Their unique sequences tied together in our documentary function as an anthology of animated sequences, each with their own unique

student in the Department of Science &amp; Technology Studies at Cornell University.  Known as much for her rousing stage presence as she is for her prowess as a beatmaker and lyricist, Enongo has spent the past several years cultivating a strong following of activists, hip hop heads, punks, and self-identified nerds and geeks, among others. As noted by the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, Enongo “has a gift for getting a message across.” Having recently made her Don Giovanni debut (while remaining tied to NuBlack Music Group), she is poised to cement herself as an artist who consistently thinks outside boxes and dances across lines (and does other neat things with geometrical figures).</p><p>In addition to managing a full-time music career, Enongo has spent the past eight years as a public-school and college level educator. After graduating from Cornell University in 2008 with a double BA in Sociology and Science &amp; Technology Studies, she was accepted into the national teaching program Teach for America and placed in Houston, Texas, where she taught elementary math and science between 2008 to 2010. In the fall semester of 2011, she returned to Cornell as a Ph.D. candidate to pursue an interest a wide array of sound studies topics, including sound and gaming as well as the identity politics of community studios.  As an academic and very-vocal feminist, Enongo has produced articles for publications such as <i>Bitch</i>, <i>For Harriet</i>, <i>Sounding Out!</i>, and <i>The Mary Sue</i> related to issues of race, hip-hop, gaming, and feminism.</p><p>Enongo has given us a tremendous gift in allowing us to document her journey as our passion project.  We cannot thank her enough for her generosity, trust, and kindness.</p><p>For more information on Enongo/Sammus, check out her official website: <a href=""http://www.sammusmusic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.sammusmusic.com</a></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570380664/if7ujehg2wmdupvw0ieo.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3><u><strong>Dan Haskett — Senior Character Designer &amp; Animation Mentor</strong></u></h3><p>Dan Haskett is a veteran animator, director, and character designer who has been in the industry for over 50 years, and is a pioneering African-American artist in the field.  He is best known as the designer of two of Disney’s classic female leads, Ariel from <i>The Little Mermaid</i> (1989) and Belle from <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> (1991).  Dan is also responsible for designing key characters from <i>The Simpsons</i> (including Moe the bartender, Barney the drunk, and Bart's teacher, Mrs. Krabappel) and various characters in <i>Toy Story</i> (1995).  Dan’s first job in animation was at the age of 17, and was hired as an assistant animator on master animator Richard Williams’ New York-based production, <i>Raggedy Ann &amp; Andy: A Musical Adventure</i> (1977) at just 23 years old.  He has since worked for virtually every major animation company across.

and wonderful enthusiasm.  With your help, we look forward to finally sharing this remarkable, inspiring story with you...</strong></i></p><p> </p><p><i><strong>– K.S.</strong></i></p></div>","Enongo is a forthcoming feature-length documentary and the inspiring story of rapper/producer/Ph.D. candidate Enongo Lumumba-Kasongo, a.k.a. Sammus.  Through her compelling and honest music, Enongo/Sammus tackles various subjects including (but certainly not limited to) race, feminism, video games, the music industry, mental health, growing up, and relationships.  Inspired by the feminist bounty hunter protagonist of Nintendo's Metroid video game series, Enongo adopted the stage persona ""Sammus"" to tell her story and experiences through her music. Enongo is many things.  She is relatable, complicated, funny, passionate, and unique.  She is an artist, a musician, a producer of her own beats, a master lyricist, a Black woman, a first-generation American of West African descent, an introvert, a gamer, a self-described ""weirdo,"" a teacher, and a friend.  Chronicling everything from Sammus touring across North America to creating her latest album to her origins and upbringing, this documentary aims to share the emotional, inspiring journey of a polymath and genuine artist... but this will only be possible with your help!   Filming is nearing completion, and editing is well underway.  We have all of the funds we need for final sound mix, color correction, and our original musical score.  Almost everything we need is there.  BUT, during the process of editing the film, we noticed that there was something extremely vital missing.  Enongo herself is a fantastic orator and storyteller, but many essential anecdotes and experiences in her life were absent from our narrative on a cinematic level.  We had little visual record of her past in the way we needed, and no way of visually showing what is going on inside her mind.  Thus, we realized how to bring those separate but crucial chapters of her journey to life: through animation.While the film mostly follows our protagonist with contemporary footage of her performing across North America, in the intimacy of her home, and behind-the-scenes access of the artist creating her next album, we are also producing over ten minutes of original, frame-by-frame, hand-drawn animation — conceived, designed, storyboarded, and brought to life by a team of eight young, Black women animators across the country — which will help tell Enongo's story.  These animation sequences will shed light on Enongo's complicated upbringing as a child of West-African immigrants living in mostly-white Upstate New York, her battles with mental health, how the feminist icon of video game heroine Samus Aran inspired her, and other key aspects of her narrative.  The animation not only fills in the narrative gaps, but expands the experience of the viewer, making a more engaging, creatively-satisfying, and moving work of cinematic storytelling. The animation style will embrace the tradition of hand-drawn ""pencil tests,” showing the artistry of the animators’ craft and personal visions behind the drawings in each frame.  Each sequence will have a unique aesthetic to it, as well, with each animation artist cast to scenes that will exemplify her vision and creative strengths.  This will also be the very first feature-length film of any genre in which all of the animators are Black women. All of our storyboards are timed as animatics, and rough animation is already underway.  Now, we just need to bring all of these drawings to life. Making a feature-length documentary is a lot of work and very expensive.  Making a very good, polished feature-length documentary shown around the world with lots of original, hand-drawn animation is even more work and is even more expensive. This is where you come in. By reaching our minimum goal of at least $20,000 (and hopefully surpassing it!), we will use those funds to finish roughing out, drawing, and clean-up on our amazing animation sequences.  If we can surpass that goal, we hope to use additional funds on any essential animation backgrounds, shading, and other elements.  Enongo's story is relatable, universal, and deeply moving.  How this story is told, and by whom, is what makes this movie really special...   Each team member on the film is assigned to a position based on their strengths and connection to the material.  Like an actor cast to a specific role or like the animation masters of the old hand-drawn days working at Disney or Warner Bros., the animators on our film, in particular, are creating, designing, and animating their own sequences based on anecdotes from our protagonist's life that they most personally connect with and based on their aesthetic sensibilities and skill sets.  Their unique sequences tied together in our documentary function as an anthology of animated sequences, each with their own unique styles and subject matters, telling one big story.  Their contributions tell the story in a way that only animation can.  Here are just a few of the many people helping to make Enongo into a reality... Photo Credit: José GinarteEnongo Lumumba-KasongoEnongo Lumumba-Kasongo (a.k.a., SAMMUS) is an Ithaca-raised, Philadelphia-based rap artist, producer, and Ph.D. student in the Department of Science & Technology Studies at Cornell University.  Known as much for her rousing stage presence as she is for her prowess as a beatmaker and lyricist, Enongo has spent the past several years cultivating a strong following of activists, hip hop heads, punks, and self-identified nerds and geeks, among others. As noted by the Los Angeles Times, Enongo “has a gift for getting a message across.” Having recently made her Don Giovanni debut (while remaining tied to NuBlack Music Group), she is poised to cement herself as an artist who consistently thinks outside boxes and dances across lines (and does other neat things with geometrical figures).In addition to managing a full-time music career, Enongo has spent the past eight years as a public-school and college level educator. After graduating from Cornell University in 2008 with a double BA in Sociology and Science & Technology Studies, she was accepted into the national teaching program Teach for America and placed in Houston, Texas, where she taught elementary math and science between 2008 to 2010. In the fall semester of 2011, she returned to Cornell as a Ph.D. candidate to pursue an interest a wide array of sound studies topics, including sound and gaming as well as the identity politics of community studios.  As an academic and very-vocal feminist, Enongo has produced articles for publications such as Bitch, For Harriet, Sounding Out!, and The Mary Sue related to issues of race, hip-hop, gaming, and feminism.Enongo has given us a tremendous gift in allowing us to document her journey as our passion project.  We cannot thank her enough for her generosity, trust, and kindness.For more information on Enongo/Sammus, check out her official website: www.sammusmusic.com  Dan Haskett — Senior Character Designer & Animation MentorDan Haskett is a veteran animator, director, and character designer who has been in the industry for over 50 years, and is a pioneering African-American artist in the field.  He is best known as the designer of two of Disney’s classic female leads, Ariel from The Little Mermaid (1989) and Belle from Beauty and the Beast (1991).  Dan is also responsible for designing key characters from The Simpsons (including Moe the bartender, Barney the drunk, and Bart's teacher, Mrs. Krabappel) and various characters in Toy Story (1995).  Dan’s first job in animation was at the age of 17, and was hired as an assistant animator on master animator Richard Williams’ New York-based production, Raggedy Ann & Andy: A Musical Adventure (1977) at just 23 years old.  He has since worked for virtually every major animation company across. North America, including (but not limited to) Disney, Pixar, Warner Bros., DreamWorks Animation, and Hanna-Barbera. He has also directed original animated shorts for Sesame Street. Initial character design sketches for Enongo by Dan Haskett, December 2018.  He still works exclusively on pencil and animation paper to this day.Dan’s five decades of knowledge and experience have laid a creative foundation for our young animation team by providing the initial character designs of our protagonist.  You can see Dan’s designs of her above and on our Instagram, @EnongoMovie: https://www.instagram.com/p/Br3glgFlDxM/  Christa Carr — Animation Artist & AnimatorChrista is a Los Angeles-based animator, character designer, and color stylist.  She graduated from the renowned Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York, with highest honors, and also had the opportunity of studying abroad for a semester at the Musashino Art University in Japan, where she honed her skills in design and personality-based animation.  A gamer herself, Christa is designing, storyboarding, and animating a scene about how primitive video games and their music inspired Enongo at a young age. ""A major goal in my career as an artist is to provide representation for Black women and show the multiplicity of our stories. Enongo has such a unique voice in hip hop music and I'm really looking forward to visualizing her journey.""– Christa CarrMore at www.christa-carr.com  Leah Coleman — Animation Artist & AnimatorLeah is currently seeking her Master’s in Animation at Ohio State University.  Previously, she attended Miami University and studied at Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia.  Inspired by her appreciation for both classic Western and Asian traditional animation masters, Leah has a refined talent for fluid, feature-quality character animation.   Leah’s sequence explores Enongo’s anxieties over her relationships, career, and academic obligations, which parallels Leah's own life. “It is truly an exciting opportunity to not only work on this documentary about a black woman and her journey through life, but also working with other Black women animators. I always talked about not having a chance to meet or find many women like me in a field dominated by the majority. Enongo will be an emotional journey for all of us, I think, because we are all going through that struggle of life, trying to figure out who we are, what our purpose is, and Enongo shows that in both her personal life and music. To have the opportunity to express her life through animation, is something I will do my best to reflect as best to her character as I possibly can!”– Leah ColemanMore at www.leahcoleman15.com Jessica Honore — AnimatorLocated in Queens, New York, Jessica graduated from the prestigious School of Visual Arts in 2011.  Since then, she has worked with animation studios such as Cartuna and Titmouse, bringing to life such shows as China, IL, Superjail!, and Ballmastrz 9009 for [adult swim], and DreamWorks Animation's Home: Adventures with Tip & Oh on Netflix.  Jessica (a big fan of video games) is animating a sequence of young Enongo imagining the dark and thrilling video game world of Super Metroid.  ""As soon as I heard of Enongo, I was intrigued. It's not every day you hear of someone with so many talents and skills.

Enongo’s music is so inspiring and I can’t wait to share her story through my art.”– Brooklyn LeeMore at www.bmoranlee.art  Shammah McVay — Associate Producer / Animation Artist & AnimatorShammah is an animator and designer living in Columbus, Ohio, and has studied at the Columbus College of Art & Design.  Her work often explores themes of identity and representation in media.  Shammah’s animated sequence concerns a deadly battle with depression, an experience that mirrors her own.  In addition to being an animator and animation artist, Shammah is working on Enongo as an associate producer, aiding in outreach and fundraising.  “Once I heard [Sammus' song] 'Mighty Morphing' for the first time, it resonated on a spiritual level; it was me described so eloquently.  Enongo is unapologetically Black, yet not afraid to be vulnerable.  Her story is inspiring and I'm honored to work on this project. This film is needed.”– Shammah McVayMore at https://www.instagram.com/shashestar/ Ruby Myles — AnimatorRuby is a Columbus, Ohio-based illustrator, animator and visual development artist who studied at the Columbus College of Art and Design.  With a strong film and theatre background, she has been allowed the opportunity to work on a wide variety of projects and hone her skills.  Ruby will be animating with Shammah McVay on one of the film's most challenging and important sequences. ""Growing up as a singer myself, it was so incredibly easy to connect with Enongo.  To have that initial connection, as well as feel and understand the story of a woman who looks like myself, and thousands of other Black girls in the world, was enough to feel I HAD to take part in whatever way I could. I am so excited and honored to be a part of such a history-making project!""– Ruby MylesMore at www.rubymyles.com & https://www.instagram.com/ruemarieart/  Ariel Paxton — Animation Artist & AnimatorAfter completing her Bachelor of Fine Arts at the Art Institute of Atlanta, Ariel is now in her final quarter of achieving her Master's Degree of Fine Arts in Animation at the acclaimed Savannah College of Art & Design.  Ariel is a prolific and talented 2D animator and storyboard artist with a remarkable visual flair for design.  Ariel is animating a sequence about how becoming a teacher for underserved students eventually led Enongo to discover the power of music.  Ariel herself has been an art teacher to young children, and is applying this experience to her sequence. ""I wanted to be a part of this project because I love the style and feel of the documentary.

Anaiyah is working on a sequence about the relationship between Enongo Lumumba-Kasongo and her fiancé, author Lanre Akinsiku.""I’m really excited about this project because I love traditional animation and for a while I was afraid the hand-drawn style would die out. It’s so exciting being part of a resurgence in appreciation for this style. I’m also looking forward to participating in this new wave of filmmaking where, not only are people of color being represented on screen, but we also have the chance to work behind the scenes, too, and help with the accuracy of that representation.""– Anaiyah TatianaMore at https://www.instagram.com/anaiyahtatiana/  Patricia Battles — Motion Graphics ArtistInspired by a myriad of art styles from the Disney animation renaissance of the 1990s and retro video games including Tomb Raider and Sonic the Hedgehog to graffiti art and Lisa Frank aesthetics, Patricia is a talented animator, illustrator, and motion graphics artist who has a phenomenal sense of color, design, and motion permeating all of her art.  She studied at the School of Visual Arts (SVA) in New York CIty and later transferred to The University of the Arts in Philadelphia on a Presidential Scholarship majoring in animation, and has since become a verified artist on Giphy.""Being a part of the Enongo team feels too surreal: like being drafted into the NBA All Star League guided by 2 of the most amazing coaches on the planet (Dan Haskett & Kevin Schreck) with the MVP being Sammus! Being able to collaborate with a super talented crew of black women animators that I've gotten to know and admire feels very comforting; a sisterhood I never thought I would experience during my lifetime. With the current political climate, the BLM movement making a huge resurgence & the global pandemic affecting everyone's life in 2020, I'm extremely thankful and grateful to share with the crew and the world the very thing that has motivated me at a tender age and has been a constant source of therapy to get through hard times: creating art from the soul <3""– Patricia BattlesMore at: https://www.patriciabattles.com/    EmmoLei Sankofa — ComposerEmmoLei is an American composer, singer-songwriter, record producer, sound artist, and multi-instrumentalist based in Los Angeles, CA.  Her work stretches across music, visual media, and fine art.  EmmoLei founded Bèl Son, a creative audio collective, in which she has worked with some of the best emerging filmmakers on a wide variety of award-winning films and visual media projects for top brands.  Her discography encompasses over sixteen independently released albums, EP’s and singles collectively.  EmmoLei has honed her craft as a mentee under renowned composer Michael Abels (celebrated for his work on Jordan Peele's acclaimed films, Get Out and Us).  Enongo will be EmmoLei’s first feature-length film, and connects deeply to our protagonist's creative ambitions and struggles in the music industry.  (She is also a long-time Sammus fan.)""What's most exciting to me about being able to work on this documentary is that I feel deeply connected to Enongo's journey.

to make this film because I'm drawn to stories about creative people.  But I rarely see stories about artists like Enongo spotlighted in mainstream movies.  So, I wanted to amplify Enongo's incredible

We are two independent filmmakers from the great city of New Orleans. We hold our degrees in filmmaking from the University of New Orleans. Through the last couple years we have work to advance our skills in the lighting, camera and directing to name a few areas of filmmaking, in order to produce great works of film art.

We are trying to start this campaign to raise the funds necessary in order to finish strong with this shoot. As you can see from the short teaser we have shot some of the movie, but still have a couple more weekends left to finish. We also want to get this into the film festival circuits.

I really think it would benefit them?”<br/><br/>Have you ever wondered what <strong>being behind-the-scenes at tennis tournaments</strong> is like?<br/><br/>Have you ever wondered <strong>how professional players and elite-level junior players train</strong>? What do they work on? How do they practice forehands, backhands, and serves? What physiotherapy routines do they partake in? Do they follow particular diets? (We know Novak Djokovic enjoys a gluten-free diet :))<br/><br/>But in general, <strong>what does the picture of achieving one’s dreams look like</strong>? What sort of dedication does it take? What does real passion for something look like? If there were a good portrayal of that somewhere, wouldn’t you like to be reminded of and exposed to that every day? Wouldn’t you like to be reminded on a regular basis of what it’s like to devote yourself to a dream? Wouldn’t you want to be a part of that?<br/><br/>Because all too often, we are reminded of all of the reasons why dreams will remain just that – contemplations for another lifetime. But we’re saying that today, it doesn’t have to be that way.<br/><br/>Sashka and her family have been uprooted from their home (more on her story<a href=""http://sashkatennis.com/sashka-story/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> here</a>) and currently don’t have the resources to fund her dream. Tennis is a costly sport. <strong>They’re seeking your help and support to keep her dream and goal of playing professional tennis alive</strong>.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480584940/dnaciyy9jigaf2hhxqct.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>What we offer is <strong>an insider look into the life of a young aspiring professional tennis player</strong>.<br/><br/>We offer a behind-the-scenes account of her journey to living out a lifelong dream. The peaks. The valleys. The wins and the losses. Think Hoop Dreams, but if the star in Hoop Dreams was Derrick Rose.<br/><br/>Even more, <strong>we offer the opportunity to provide input and feedback to Sashka throughout her journey</strong>. If you’ve ever wanted to be a part of a professional tennis player’s team, but you lack the connections to other pros, here’s your chance!<br/><br/><i><strong>We HAVE</strong></i>: a promising junior female tennis player aspiring to the professional ranks.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481729236/donfgopbvagdz8i1a1mg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i><strong>We NEED</strong></i>: real tennis fans to be <strong>our supporters, mentors, and team members</strong>.<br/><br/>We want you to be a backer for the world's first crowdfunded tennis player. <strong>She could be YOUR player!</strong></p>
<p><i>...Crowdfunding has already had an impact on just about every other industry. Now it is time to add professional sports to that list. We are offering you the chance to be an influential member of a global team aiding the development of a real professional tennis player. </i><br/><br/><strong>Here are some of the benefits</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can <strong>have access</strong> to practices through web streams; you can <strong>discuss your opinions</strong> with other team members; and you <strong>have the ability to provide your insight</strong> and opinion to the player and coaches on court in real time. You will be heard!</li>
<li>You can <strong>visit tournaments</strong> to support your player and even <strong>visit VIP lounges and boxes</strong> (upon availability of tickets and seats)</li>
<li>You can <strong>participate in tournament planning</strong> in order to help Sashka build her game and improve her ranking</li>
<li>You can <strong>watch Sashka’s matche</strong>s and help the team analyze and assess what they see</li>
<li>You can <strong>develop media contacts and sponsor relations</strong>
</li>
<li>Or, you can choose to do none of these things and simply<strong> have someone to cheer for</strong> on a daily basis.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/><strong>We’ll keep you updated!</strong> It’d be really cool to have a close relationship with someone you’re watching play in the U.S. Open.<br/><br/><strong><i>Now is the time to join us. We aim to unite people around the (crazy) idea of growing and developing a junior tennis player through a crowdfunding community. We want to put all of our efforts, resources, and energy into our player’s development. </i></strong><br/><br/>And without further ado, here is our player, <strong>Oleksandra “Sashka” Oliynykova</strong>.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481731052/lskvyzcnobba1a2sqoxu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>Sashka is <strong>a promising junior tennis player</strong> in the very beginning of her professional tennis career. She is a 3-time junior champion of Croatia in doubles and 2-time semi-finalist in singles. She is <strong>a winner/runner-up of many international junior championships</strong> in singles and doubles, including the highly regarded junior Sweden Open. She is a member of the Croatia Junior National Team.<br/><br/>A very open-minded, positive, and hard-working personality, Sashka has a very touching story. She and her family were forced to flee from their home in Ukraine, leaving them in a distant country without any possessions or solid income streams. You can read the whole story in detail <a href=""http://sashkatennis.com/sashka-%20story/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<p>Sashka &amp; her coaches are <strong>truly ready</strong> to cooperate with a global support team. She is a ""tabula rasa"", a blank slate. We can develop the ideal player together!</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are aiming to raise $60,000 USD. It is<strong> a complete training and expense budget</strong> for 2 seasons (2017-2018).</p>
<p><i><strong>How it is going to be distributed (yearly model):</strong></i></p>
<ul>
<li>$18,000 USD (<i>or $1,500 USD monthly</i>): ""all-covered"" training at our base in Porec, Croatia. This will include 4-5 hours/day of on-court training, 1-2 hours/day of fitness and conditioning, mental training, and tactical exercises and match analysis as per needed. It will also cover recovery and physiotherapy.</li>
<li>$10,000 USD (<i>or about $835 USD monthly</i>): the travel budget. This sum will cover tickets and tournament fees for both tournaments providing hospitality (room and board paid by a tournament) and tournaments not providing hospitality. We will optimize our travel budget by using low cost airlines and by sharing apartments/hotels with other players. We will also try to include as many tournaments with provided hospitality as possible.</li>
<li>$2,000 USD: the yearly equipment budget. It includes rackets, strings, shoes, garments, bags, sport foods, drinks &amp; vitamins.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will regularly <strong>publish a financial report open for all backers</strong>. You will see how we spend the budget and will be able to suggest or comment any different ways to improve efficiency.<br/><br/>We have prepared special rewards for every backer - really EVERYONE who wants to participate in this exciting pro tennis travel. From a ""thank you"" note on our web site &amp; social media, through <strong>team baseball caps &amp; t-shirts</strong>, to <strong>your name/logo</strong> on a player's t-shirt during <strong>a real junior &amp; pro tennis tournament</strong>!<br/><br/>Our main offering, though, is <strong>INVOLVEMENT</strong>. You have a chance to be part of the Sashka team. Support our project and join a <strong>BIG TENNIS INNOVATION</strong>: the world’s first crowdfunded tennis player.</p>
<p>If we raise <strong>more funds than our target</strong>, we will add it to current player's budget - so our player will get a competitve edge.<br/><br/>If we raise less, we will attract financing from other sources (sponsors, merchandise sales etc.).</p>
<h3>Why it is important?</h3>
<p>For two reasons. <strong>First</strong>, a successful campaign means Sashka’s dream and goal of playing professional tennis stays alive. <strong>Two</strong>, it shows us that possibility is only limited to what you can conceive and all that is needed is a dream big enough and a little bit of creativity. A successful campaign here potentially enables countless others with similarly challenging circumstances and stories to keep their dreams and goals alive.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481657784/gpksoil5vaqxzu2fxgwy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Keeping the dream alive is what crowdfunding is all about</strong>. Viewers see projects that they’d like to see in existence, and they back those projects. Oftentimes, it’s not about what backers get in return. It’s about seeing something in existence and knowing that you were part of the building process.<br/><br/>We’d like to see Sashka continue her ascension to the professional ranks and with some help make it to the top, but without some help, whether it’s here or somewhere else, the venture will die before even having a chance.<br/><br/><strong>You have dreamed of being a part of the game</strong>, and now we are offering you the opportunity.<br/><br/>Sashka, <strong>a teenage girl from a low-income refugee family</strong>, could not finance this long and costly travel to tennis success on her own.

A successful campaign here opens the door for so many others, proving that ""the sky is the limit"". If you want to dance - dance. If you want to play tennis - do it. <strong>If you want to be a pro sport manager/agent - join us &amp; try it out!</strong></p>
<p>We can not guarantee that Sashka will win Grand Slams or the Olympic Games. But we do guarantee that we will be together with our backers <strong>throughout her professional career</strong>. It will be an exciting trip!</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Tennis is a highly competitive sport. Thousands of players from all over the world compete to enter the world top-200 list, where most attention &amp; public visibility are concentrated.<br/><br/>We have a highly professional team here – Sashka, her coaches, and her parents. But we hope <strong>to make the team even stronger by adding you to the team</strong>. Join us!</p>
<p>Sashka’s tennis career will surely include both sides of the coin – wins and losses, victories and defeat, milestones and setbacks. We understand that is part of the process. We are to be patient and take it one challenge at a time. Knowing that she will achieve her tennis goals, we are to work with the intent of bringing that belief to fruition. She wants to play professional tennis and make a living at it. Now it’s about the steady climb to make that dream a reality.<br/><br/><strong>We wouldn’t be here, running a crowdfunding campaign</strong>, if Sashka didn’t believe she could make it. And right now, this crowdfunding campaign is a part of that steady climb.</p>
<p>There is always risk of injury. It is elite-level athletics, after all. But with the proper care and attentiveness – physical training, recovery, and quality physiotherapy – <strong>that risk can be minimized</strong>. And in the instance of an injury, it can be well managed and healed.</p>

I really think it would benefit them?”Have you ever wondered what being behind-the-scenes at tennis tournaments is like?Have you ever wondered how professional players and elite-level junior players train? What do they work on? How do they practice forehands, backhands, and serves? What physiotherapy routines do they partake in? Do they follow particular diets? (We know Novak Djokovic enjoys a gluten-free diet :))But in general, what does the picture of achieving one’s dreams look like? What sort of dedication does it take? What does real passion for something look like? If there were a good portrayal of that somewhere, wouldn’t you like to be reminded of and exposed to that every day? Wouldn’t you like to be reminded on a regular basis of what it’s like to devote yourself to a dream? Wouldn’t you want to be a part of that?Because all too often, we are reminded of all of the reasons why dreams will remain just that – contemplations for another lifetime. But we’re saying that today, it doesn’t have to be that way.Sashka and her family have been uprooted from their home (more on her story here) and currently don’t have the resources to fund her dream. Tennis is a costly sport. They’re seeking your help and support to keep her dream and goal of playing professional tennis alive.
What we offer is an insider look into the life of a young aspiring professional tennis player.We offer a behind-the-scenes account of her journey to living out a lifelong dream. The peaks. The valleys. The wins and the losses. Think Hoop Dreams, but if the star in Hoop Dreams was Derrick Rose.Even more, we offer the opportunity to provide input and feedback to Sashka throughout her journey. If you’ve ever wanted to be a part of a professional tennis player’s team, but you lack the connections to other pros, here’s your chance!We HAVE: a promising junior female tennis player aspiring to the professional ranks.
We NEED: real tennis fans to be our supporters, mentors, and team members.We want you to be a backer for the world's first crowdfunded tennis player. She could be YOUR player!
...Crowdfunding has already had an impact on just about every other industry. Now it is time to add professional sports to that list. We are offering you the chance to be an influential member of a global team aiding the development of a real professional tennis player. Here are some of the benefits:

You can have access to practices through web streams; you can discuss your opinions with other team members; and you have the ability to provide your insight and opinion to the player and coaches on court in real time. You will be heard!
You can visit tournaments to support your player and even visit VIP lounges and boxes (upon availability of tickets and seats)
You can participate in tournament planning in order to help Sashka build her game and improve her ranking
You can watch Sashka’s matches and help the team analyze and assess what they see
You can develop media contacts and sponsor relations

Or, you can choose to do none of these things and simply have someone to cheer for on a daily basis.

We’ll keep you updated! It’d be really cool to have a close relationship with someone you’re watching play in the U.S. Open.Now is the time to join us. We aim to unite people around the (crazy) idea of growing and developing a junior tennis player through a crowdfunding community. We want to put all of our efforts, resources, and energy into our player’s development. And without further ado, here is our player, Oleksandra “Sashka” Oliynykova.Sashka is a promising junior tennis player in the very beginning of her professional tennis career. She is a 3-time junior champion of Croatia in doubles and 2-time semi-finalist in singles. She is a winner/runner-up of many international junior championships in singles and doubles, including the highly regarded junior Sweden Open. She is a member of the Croatia Junior National Team.A very open-minded, positive, and hard-working personality, Sashka has a very touching story. She and her family were forced to flee from their home in Ukraine, leaving them in a distant country without any possessions or solid income streams. You can read the whole story in detail here.
Sashka & her coaches are truly ready to cooperate with a global support team. She is a ""tabula rasa"", a blank slate. We can develop the ideal player together!
What We Need & What You Get
We are aiming to raise $60,000 USD. It is a complete training and expense budget for 2 seasons (2017-2018).
How it is going to be distributed (yearly model):

$18,000 USD (or $1,500 USD monthly): ""all-covered"" training at our base in Porec, Croatia. This will include 4-5 hours/day of on-court training, 1-2 hours/day of fitness and conditioning, mental training, and tactical exercises and match analysis as per needed. It will also cover recovery and physiotherapy.
$10,000 USD (or about $835 USD monthly): the travel budget. This sum will cover tickets and tournament fees for both tournaments providing hospitality (room and board paid by a tournament) and tournaments not providing hospitality. We will optimize our travel budget by using low cost airlines and by sharing apartments/hotels with other players. We will also try to include as many tournaments with provided hospitality as possible.
$2,000 USD: the yearly equipment budget. It includes rackets, strings, shoes, garments, bags, sport foods, drinks & vitamins.

We will regularly publish a financial report open for all backers. You will see how we spend the budget and will be able to suggest or comment any different ways to improve efficiency.We have prepared special rewards for every backer - really EVERYONE who wants to participate in this exciting pro tennis travel. From a ""thank you"" note on our web site & social media, through team baseball caps & t-shirts, to your name/logo on a player's t-shirt during a real junior & pro tennis tournament!Our main offering, though, is INVOLVEMENT. You have a chance to be part of the Sashka team. Support our project and join a BIG TENNIS INNOVATION: the world’s first crowdfunded tennis player.
If we raise more funds than our target, we will add it to current player's budget - so our player will get a competitve edge.If we raise less, we will attract financing from other sources (sponsors, merchandise sales etc.).

<p><b><i>The Project </i></b></p>
<p>Since January 2014 I've been documenting the life of<i> British Muay Thai superstar Greg Wootton. Capturing his rise and journey to becoming a 2 time World Champion and one of the most feared fighters in the sport. Now on the 20th of November he takes to the international stage - fighting for his 3rd World Title in the United States &amp; we need your help to get out there and capture this amazing moment in his career which will be the perfect ending to our film.</i></p>
<p>Greg is a humble champion that has dedicated his life to Muay Thai and is now reaping the rewards. At the same time he is keen to pass on his knowledge to the next generation. The film adopts a split narrative following Greg as he prepares himself to take on some of the best fighters in the world and also captures the journey of 9 year old Jimmy Clarke who Greg takes under his wing and guides to his first title. </p>
<p>Greg and Jimmy both train out of the world famous KO Gym in Bethnal Green. The film captures the unique atmosphere of the gym and shows the fighters philosophy of always helping the next person behind you, resulting in the gym producing over 20 world champions.</p>
<p>I've been friends with Greg for 20 years which has allowed me to capture an intimate unflinching look at what he goes through physically &amp; mentally to fight at the top level. </p>

<p>This is a real passion project for myself as I've know Greg for such a long time and up until this point I've self financed the film myself but with this world title fight only being scheduled in the last week it hasn't allowed me and the crew to put money aside to hire equipment and travel to the United States.

<br/><p>The Hidden Talent Film</p>
<p>
 This movie is about a girl who parents were killed when she was at the 
age of 5 years old. After she was found next to her parents she was then
 sent to a foster home, While in this foster she was being molested and 
abused. As She grows up she runs away from home going into a even harder
 lifestyle As a stripper. Surviving to make it on her own, Until she 
meets this guy who changed her whole life around, this guy took her out 
of the her lifestyle because he seen what she didn't see in herself 
which was her hidden talent.</p>
<p>NOTE: I WILL NOT REVEAL WHAT HER HIDDEN TALENT IS YOU HAVE TO WAIT.</p>
<p>I
 myself have been trying to make this film for 3 years but, every time i
 try to get funded i never succeed. All my life family and people i 
associated myself with would always say that i would never succeed. i 
would hear the words ever since i was in grammar school, I would be 
bullied everyday praying to god, asking to make my dream come true. I 
spent 24/7 writing this film. That's how dedicated i am </p>
<p>This film
 is a very heart felt film and my goal for this film is it to have a 
voice. I wake up everyday seeing people on television and in person who 
have been hurt, abused, and molested and no one does anything about it. 
It even happens to people in there own homes blood related.</p>
<p>All my
 life i always wanted to help people and i know that this film is going 
to change so many lives. I cry for people because i feel there pain and i
 see there hurt and its like i want to do something for them and i 
believe that this film will be perfect.</p>
<p>I mean filming is my life 
and i would die for it. It saved my life, one day as a child i was 
bullied so bad after being jumped by 15 people because i smiled to much 
and because i was always happy. I wanted to commit suicide because i was
 tired of being invisible or a target. Students wasn't just doing this 
teachers would also do this. I remember as a child i told my teacher i 
wanted to be a movie director and she said, that i will never be 
anything and put a L on my forehead and whole class began to laugh. I 
was humiliated i didn't know what to do.</p>
<p>I remember being home 
alone and the tv turned on i was crying so bad. If i had a bag it would 
be full of tears i cried so much because i didn't understand why people 
didn't like me.</p>
<p>When the TV turned on a movie made by Steven 
Spielberg came on called Jaws and it motivated me so much i wanted to 
make films. I wanted to tell people about my life i wanted to be a voice
 for people. So at the age of 10 i went to the library and got 10 books 
about film and i read everyday even during school about film. I begin to
 see the world different as art, i begin to see beauty and it took me 
into world we know as the film world where every dream comes true, every
 fear that i have is placed in one genre such as horror, every laughing 
moment goes into the genre of comedy, every part of love that was in my 
life goes into the genre of romance. I build this world around me to 
understand the meaning of my imagination. When i write i begin to turn 
into a kid again and just begin to imagine everything. Steven Spielberg 
has truly inspired me and i want to show the world my world.</p>

 make my dream come true so i can open my imagination to the world. Now

I
 myself have been trying to make this film for 3 years but, every time i
 try to get funded i never succeed. All my life family and people i 
associated myself with would always say that i would never succeed. i 
would hear the words ever since i was in grammar school, I would be 
bullied everyday praying to god, asking to make my dream come true. I 
spent 24/7 writing this film. That's how dedicated i am 
This film
 is a very heart felt film and my goal for this film is it to have a 
voice. I wake up everyday seeing people on television and in person who 
have been hurt, abused, and molested and no one does anything about it. 
It even happens to people in there own homes blood related.
All my
 life i always wanted to help people and i know that this film is going 
to change so many lives. I cry for people because i feel there pain and i
 see there hurt and its like i want to do something for them and i 
believe that this film will be perfect.
I mean filming is my life 
and i would die for it. It saved my life, one day as a child i was 
bullied so bad after being jumped by 15 people because i smiled to much 
and because i was always happy. I wanted to commit suicide because i was
 tired of being invisible or a target. Students wasn't just doing this 
teachers would also do this. I remember as a child i told my teacher i 
wanted to be a movie director and she said, that i will never be 
anything and put a L on my forehead and whole class began to laugh. I 
was humiliated i didn't know what to do.
I remember being home 
alone and the tv turned on i was crying so bad. If i had a bag it would 
be full of tears i cried so much because i didn't understand why people 
didn't like me.
When the TV turned on a movie made by Steven 
Spielberg came on called Jaws and it motivated me so much i wanted to 
make films. I wanted to tell people about my life i wanted to be a voice
 for people. So at the age of 10 i went to the library and got 10 books 
about film and i read everyday even during school about film. I begin to
 see the world different as art, i begin to see beauty and it took me 
into world we know as the film world where every dream comes true, every
 fear that i have is placed in one genre such as horror, every laughing 
moment goes into the genre of comedy, every part of love that was in my 
life goes into the genre of romance. I build this world around me to 
understand the meaning of my imagination. When i write i begin to turn 
into a kid again and just begin to imagine everything. Steven Spielberg 
has truly inspired me and i want to show the world my world.




I will never stop dreaming, dreaming is what changed me and dreaming is what can change you
I will never stop believing because without believing i cant dream
Film is my life and i will never forget it
Help
 make my dream come true so i can open my imagination to the world. Now 
in my world there is peace, there is kindness, creativity the eyes could
 never imagine. Everything in this world is a genre and this is where 
the magic begin to happen.",3.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Discover, along with Truman, the true human nature. Delve into a story that lays bare the complexity of human life.Kill evil creatures that threaten your family and the world, avoid leaving clues at the crime scenes, survive interrogations, find a job, and nourish the love of your family. Live a double life. One as a hero who must venture into the abyss to save his city, and the other, as an ordinary man with a job, friends and family.Platforms: Windows/MAC/LinuxTruman lives with his family in a fictional city called Falldale. In the last few months, Falldale has experienced an outbreak of violence, crime, murders, corruption and drug traffic.One day, a deity appears before Truman. This deity tells Truman that the high rates of crime and corruption are not a coincidence. Evil creatures have invaded the city and now Truman's family, and the whole world, are in true danger.This deity entrusts Truman with an enormous mission: kill every evil creature in the city. These creatures disguise themselves as regular people, and only Truman can see marks on their faces that reveal their true nature.Truman is not a hero, nor a soldier, he's a regular guy with an enormous mission.Because of his limitations, Truman must kill the evil creatures one by one, like a serial killer. He's on a solo mission and has to be very smart in order to avoid being stopped by either the evil creatures or the police. He has to be very clever and avoid leaving clues behind in crime scenes or raising suspicion from his friends and family. The police will do anything to stop him, especially since it's election time in Falldale and they can't afford a “serial killer” to roam free in the streets.This mission also starts in the middle of a marriage crisis between Truman and his wife, Dana. Truman is fighting not just for the safety of his family but also their love.Truman: The Face Eraser has a non-linear story and every decision, every action in the game will matter.Truman: The Face Eraser is a non-linear adventure game where your main mission is to kill the evil creatures who have invaded Falldale. Since you are the only one capable of differentiating these creatures from common people, you must plan each hit carefully, avoid leaving clues for the police, avoid getting caught, and prevent your family from getting suspicious.Falldale is an open map, and Truman can move around as he wishes, searching for the evil creatures, completing jobs, spending time with his family, hiding bodies and cleaning up crime scenes.Each hit is different. There will be times when you can plan the murder with time, clean crime scenes, or even deceive your target to get it in your car and take it to the basement of your old house. There may be times you have to be faster, and even reckless, killing one target in an alley, or in the bathroom of a restaurant.Once you have killed an evil creature you have to hide the body as soon as possible to avoid being discovered by the police. If the police find the body, they will surely find some clue that leads them directly to you.The game features a number of interconnected systems - suspicion, love, ego, humanity and money.Suspicion BarThe Suspicion Bar is a crucial part of Truman: The Face Eraser. All your actions and decisions matter. If the police find a body and they find some clues, your Suspicion Bar will go up. If your wife, a Falldale citizen or a friend get suspicious, the bar will go up. If the bar reaches the top... Game Over! You will get arrested.You can reduce the Suspicion Bar with different activities in the game. Knowing how to lie to your family or to the police is critical to survival in Truman: The Face Eraser.LoveDon't forget the reason why you have taken on your mission: to protect your family. So you can't forget them while looking in the dark streets of Falldale for your next target! You must care for the love of your family with the same importance as your mission. The Love of your family is a fundamental part of the game and will have a direct impact on the development of the story, and of course, the ending of the game. Depending on your actions, the love of your wife and daughter will increase or decrease, so don't forget to spend time with them.Tip: Being extremely loving with your family is not necessarily a good thing.EgoTruman is a regular guy. Killing evil creatures in Falldale will affect him terribly. Not only that, your Ego will be affected if you have a bad day, or if you fight with your wife or your daughter.If Truman has a low Ego, he can't be loving with his family. So you must take care of how Truman is feeling! It's not the same playing with an upset Truman, than playing with a calm Truman. A Truman with a low Ego will be more careless when he has to clean crime scenes, or will have less time to answer a question in an interrogation, etc.Since your Ego affects how you relate with your family, managing it plays a crucial role in the game.Tip: Did you have a bad day? Have a drink at your favorite bar.HumanityIf Ego represents how Truman feels in the moment, Humanity represent's Truman's sanity and the long term impact of killing the evil creatures. Each time you kill a target, your Humanity will descend, and because of that, you will lose the ability to get closer to your family, to loving them, be a good husband and father for them. Tip: Increase your Humanity by doing good actions in Falldale. Get closer to the people in need and help them.MoneyYou, Truman, have a family and you need to provide for them in addition to carrying out your mission. You'll need to find a job, live two lives, be a hero for Falldale, but also, for your own family.Your family will need money every day in order to survive. And you, you'll need money to buy stuff like weapons to subdue the evil creatures, or bags and ropes to hide bodies.Tip: Find a job that makes Truman happy, that could make your mission easier.MemoriesThere will be times in Truman: The Face Eraser where you'll relive Truman's memories. These memories will be fully playable. Even in these memories, the actions and decisions that you make in the past will resound in the present. Take this into account!
Open World: Falldale is an open world city where you can discover quests, characters and many things to do.

Become an outlaw hero: kill evil creatures that threaten your family. Become a ""serial killer"" and protect the city.

Avoid to leave clues behind: the police will try to stop you. You have to be very clever to clean up and avoid leaving clues in crime scenes.

Survive interrogations: the police may ask where you've been, so will your family. Sometimes you have to lie, and at other times, combine truth with falsehood.

Hide bodies in Falldale: if the police find a body, surely they'll find clues that will lead them to you!

Suspicion Bar: depending on your decisions and actions, this bar will go up or down. If the bar reaches the top... Game Over! You'll get arrested.

Love: you have to take care of your family and spend time with them. The Love of your family will increase or decrease depending on your actions.

Humanity: Truman will be affected each time he kills an evil creature. A Truman with low Humanity can't be loving with his family, or be happy.

Ego: you can monitor how Truman is feeling all the time. A Truman with a low Ego can't be loving with his family or careful with his mission.

Money: you have to provide your family and have money to accomplish your mission. You need a job!

Memories: you'll also play Truman's past through his memories. The decisions and actions you make in the past, will resound in the present.

Decisions Matter: Truman: The Face Eraser is all about your decisions. Even small decisions such as where you bought at item or whether you called your wife or daughter can alter the course of the game.

Different Endings: every action and decision in the game will affect the ending. How much does your family love you? Is your Humanity intact? We will have many different endings. Can you unlock them all?This are the main characters of Truman: The Face Eraser.Truman Prichard is a beloved father and husband. Since he was very young, he was capable to detect the true human nature of people. He lives with his family in Falldale, a city that suffers the ravages of crime. He's on a solo mission: stop the evil creatures that are taking over the city and threaten his family. He has to kill every evil creature one by one, like a serial killer. It is his sacrifice for the welfare of his family.The deity has known Truman since he was a little boy. The deity recognized the talent of Truman since the very beginning, so he entrusted him with his great mission to stop the evil creatures in Falldale. The deity is Truman's adviser throughout his adventure.Dana Prichard is Truman's wife. She has been his girlfriend since they was young. Now they have a beautiful daughter that they love very much. They are currently going through the worst crisis in their marriage, but Dana is a strong woman and will do anything to keep her family together. She knows Truman very well, his past and his dreams.Sonia Prichard is a daughter beloved by her parents, Truman and Dana. She is the strongest motivation for Truman's mission. She means everything to Truman and he would do anything in order to protect her. Sonia means love and happiness for the troubled couple.If you govern a city with crime problems and need a quick, if not entirely legal, solution, you call Detective Bowen. ""The end justifies the means"" is his philosophy. He will use all available resources to stop the ""serial killer"" of Falldale.Our team is working very hard to create an original soundtrack for Truman: The Face Eraser.

<u>UPDATE:</u> With our Indiegogo campaign &amp; private investors, we have raised over $15,000—which means we're at 75%!</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>We'd love your help to raise the remaining $5,000 by tomorrow afternoon! </h3>

<h3>SUMMARY</h3>
<p>A young man sees a girl on the subway and in a moment of madness, follows her. Thus begins a night of wandering through New York City as he attempts to understand—what he’s unfortunate enough to think might be—the girl of his dreams. </p>
<p>A black-and-white love letter to a certain kind of woman and the unseen backstreets of New York City, THE LAST SUMMER is the directorial debut of writer and actress Francesca Root-Dodson.</p>
<p>This film is a labour of love, supported by a wonderfully dedicated cast &amp; crew. Shot in ten days on a shoestring budget, run and gun as it gets, with a small but tireless crew, we came out the other end with beautiful footage and a big dream.</p>
<p>Our campaign is to raise finishing funds for the film, including the costs of an editor, sound mix, hiring a composer, and applying to the festivals that are the lifeblood of small movies like this, among many other things. Your contribution will enable us to take the footage we shot and craft it into a final, finished movie.</p>
<p>Making art—and especially movies—is hard. And getting a first feature film off the ground is the most difficult part of being a filmmaker. This project couldn’t have come to fruition without the help and faith of dozens of people who have contributed their time, talent and services to this project.</p>
<p>And now we need you—members of our families, friends, and community—to give whatever you’re able to so that we can take our dream and make it into a reality. </p>

<h2>(tr)Ashley</h2>
<p>Hey Guys and Gals,</p>
<p>Dennis here. I am the director of the short film <i>(tr)Ashley</i>. I am currently a film student in Full Sail University's online Digital Cinematography program. I have learned a lot, and have been afforded many opportunities to work on short films, and I am now working on my first feature film, <i>Mack.</i> You can see all of this on <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7972036/?ref_=nmmi_mi_nm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">my IMDb Page</a>. </p>
<p>I am now approaching the end of my curriculum at Full Sail, and my final project is to make a short narrative film, about 4-8 minutes in length, which will showcase all of my talents and knowledge gained at FSU. Michael, the writer of <i>(tr)Ashley</i>, first introduced the idea of a lonely man that builds a woman out of trash, while we were participating in the Houston 48 Hour Film Project. We went with another story idea, but (tr)Ashley stayed on my mind, and a couple months later, I introduced the idea of using it for my thesis film, and Michael agreed, and wrote the script. </p>
<p>Most of the cast and crew are assembled, and all we need now is funding. This is where you come in. Read below to find out more information about where your money will go, what perks you can gain, and what else you can do to help.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Your funding will help provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Equipment for the film (lenses, lights, etc.)</li>
<li>Food for the cast and crew</li>
<li>Payment for location use, and insurance (if necessary)</li>
<li>Props </li>
<li>Funding to provide the perks listed</li>
</ul>
<p>In return, you will get access some or all of the following perks:</p>

<li>Behind the scenes footage and photos</li>
<li>Blooper, as well as cast and crew interviews</li>
<li>Film commentary</li>
<li>A <strong>limited</strong> <strong>edition</strong> signed script</li>
<li>A digital copy of the short film</li>
<li>A <strong>limited edition</strong> signed poster by the cast and crew</li>
<li>Producer credit</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I am going to be honest, this film is not life changing, nor is it world changing. It will not save the whales, stop global warming, or end terrorism. However, that should not discourage one from telling a story. The impact this film will have is that a group of friend will be able to come together, and tell a fun and absurd story about a man that builds a woman out of trash. Then those friend can take that story and share it with the world. There are of course morals and lessons, but they take backseat to the idea that with the technology we have today, anyone can tell a story that can forever be immortalized into the medium of film.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenges for this short film is time and money. It is difficult to synchronize the schedules of 8-10 people over the course of a month, especially for little to no pay.  The challenges are great, but they do not make this project impossible. This short film has been in the works for several months now. The cast and crew are aware of the demands of the project and have worked to help schedule scenes efficiently.</p>
<p>The money problem is where you come in. By donating to this Indiegogo campaign, you are helping (tr)Ashley progress from an idea, to a reality.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<li>If you cannot donate at this time, no worries. We won't hold it against you.</li>

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p><i>The dead have risen to warn the living of the oncoming apocalypse, but no one cares.</i></p>
<p><strong>ZOMB'D</strong> is a socio political satire based around the coming of the four horsemen of the apocalypse. Humanity has been invaded by the dead and has no clue how to deal with their new supernatural immigrants from the afterlife.</p>
<p>The World Foundation for Peace and Divinity (secretly the four horsemen <strong>War, Famine, Pestilence and Death</strong>) enlist an army of civilian recruits and mercenaries known as the<strong> ""Z-Squad"" </strong>to clean up the wandering undead nuisances that the Zomb's have become.</p>
<p>Ferris (played by <strong>Harley Neville</strong>), with the help of his recently deceased best friend Ed, the <strong>Society for Prevention of Cruelty for Zombies</strong> and a Nun assassin lead a zombie horde against the horsemen in an all-out quest to save humanity from self-destruction.</p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>I am an independent film maker. Originally I started in the industry as an animator on Walt Disney Television contracts. These days I prefer to deal with subjects that are not so Disney friendly. </li>
<li>We are all angry with the horror's of our modern world. To be able to laugh at them is an important part of dealing and diffusing the problems. After all, the greatest weapon against Terrorism is laughter!</li>
<li>We are trying to move our careers on to the next level. This project is my vessel to allow us to help raise us all up together. We can learn together in a fun environment, elevate our craft and hopefully win some festival prizes along the way.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>While we need more than our campaign goal of $500 we wanted to keep things small to begin with. Ideally we would need a minimum of $1400 to shoot this pilot and $10000 to film the entire series at an extremely low budget and reduced rates. With this campaign even after the three weeks is up you can continue to support us on this campaign and maintain a presence in our community.</li>
<li>Our campaign is unique in that there is transparency in regards to where your contribution will be used.</li>
<li>If we do not reach our entire goal the campaign funds will be used to cover the basics, such as zombie contact lenses, some items of costume (Z-Squad Tactical Vests), catering and petrol.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Right now the world needs to regain it's sense of humor. The dead are vilified into wandering cannibals devoid of empathy, as the living worry about how many likes their posts get on Facebook. I want to reclaim the dead from George Romero's ""Night of the living dead"" and ABC's ""The Walking Dead"". I want to give them their soul's back, because dead people need love too! Otherwise what are all those flowers on the graves all about? </li>
<li>This is not the first time I have made a production with limited resources. Valley of the Succubus proved at least that I have a unique voice and some one at the Court Metrage selection committee at 67th Festival de Cannes  heard it. </li>
<li>We want to keep making projects and we need your help. There is no doubt that these are not the projects that we can make a living off but at least with your help we don't need to take such a big loss as we work toward that goal of sustainability. The magic of crowdfunding is that a trickle from many streams becomes a powerful resource for both raising funds and proving we have an audience for our production.This is where you can get involved, as family, friends, partners or just interested members of the public who just want to help.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>This is not my first production. I have 25+ years experience on Film Making at a low budget level and for the bigger studio's such as Walt Disney Television. I live, eat and breath film making and script writing. All we want is a chance to really show what we are capable of doing, without the usual struggle that comes with having no budget. It's a struggle enough to create a film without working with one hand tied behind your back or working on an empty stomach.</li>
<li>I have made a career out of problem solving. Finding solutions at cost and cheaper than my predecessors. Even now as I prepare to shoot I'm running through multiple scenario's to roll with the punches should something go wrong. I mean, something can ALWAYS go wrong! But I'm a problem solver and I'm prepared. Help me to be in an even better position to deal with any issues as they occur! Give us your support and donate to one or more of these wonderful perks we have created for you, so that you can secure your position in the community around our film and cinematographic family!</li>

<div>
<p>Thanks
to the digital revolution, we are more vividly exposed to images of violent
conflict in remote corners of the world than ever before. Yet, even though 2016
is the 70th anniversary of the creation of the United Nations , few people in
the world are aware that that there are currently 16 active United Nations
Peacekeeping Missions and 126,247 U.N. Peacekeepers on the ground, with a total
budget of $8.47 billion,  trying to
resolve these conflicts and protect civilian lives,</p>
<p>This is a
serious deficiency, because UN Peacekeeping is acting in the name of the
international community, and the international community should know what it
being done in their name. There is no question that UN Peacekeeping is becoming
of increased importance in countries of the world in need of rule of law and
stability to recover from the ravages of armed conflict, Indeed, it is safe to
say that the international community has learned from past mistakes that
unilateral interventions are neither viable nor sustainable, as we can now see
in Iraq.</p>
<p>For political
and structural reasons, the UN lacks the capacity to produce documentaries which
can explain the nuances and complexities of each UN Peacekeeping mission.
Fortunately, there are some decision makers in the UN who recognize the
deficiencies of the organization, and they usually support documentarians who
try to provide this service. </p>
<p>The same cannot
be said for the corporate media entities who ; instead of producing quality
documentaries themselves on UN peacekeeping efforts around the world, they
prefer to deride UN efforts as simplistic propaganda.</p>
<p><b>As a result, to the best of our knowledge,
there is currently no feature documentary on the market  which shows any U.N. Peacekeeping mission in
action. </b></p>
<p>The
goal of this documentary feature is therefore to tell the untold story of the
largest and oldest of these missions, <i>MONUSCO,</i>
the United Nations Stabilization Mission to the Congo. <b><i>A MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: THE UNITED NATIONS
IN THE CONGO </i></b>is a featuredocumentary
 (c. 90 min ) about the Sisyphean

</div></div>","Producer's statement:

Thanks
to the digital revolution, we are more vividly exposed to images of violent
conflict in remote corners of the world than ever before. Yet, even though 2016
is the 70th anniversary of the creation of the United Nations , few people in
the world are aware that that there are currently 16 active United Nations
Peacekeeping Missions and 126,247 U.N. Peacekeepers on the ground, with a total
budget of $8.47 billion,  trying to
resolve these conflicts and protect civilian lives,
This is a
serious deficiency, because UN Peacekeeping is acting in the name of the
international community, and the international community should know what it
being done in their name. There is no question that UN Peacekeeping is becoming
of increased importance in countries of the world in need of rule of law and
stability to recover from the ravages of armed conflict, Indeed, it is safe to
say that the international community has learned from past mistakes that
unilateral interventions are neither viable nor sustainable, as we can now see
in Iraq.
For political
and structural reasons, the UN lacks the capacity to produce documentaries which
can explain the nuances and complexities of each UN Peacekeeping mission.
Fortunately, there are some decision makers in the UN who recognize the
deficiencies of the organization, and they usually support documentarians who
try to provide this service. 
The same cannot
be said for the corporate media entities who ; instead of producing quality
documentaries themselves on UN peacekeeping efforts around the world, they
prefer to deride UN efforts as simplistic propaganda.
As a result, to the best of our knowledge,
there is currently no feature documentary on the market  which shows any U.N. Peacekeeping mission in
action. 
The
goal of this documentary feature is therefore to tell the untold story of the
largest and oldest of these missions, MONUSCO,
the United Nations Stabilization Mission to the Congo. A MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: THE UNITED NATIONS
IN THE CONGO is a featuredocumentary
 (c. 90 min ) about the Sisyphean
struggle of MONUSCO to bring peace
and stability to the Congo. This will not be an official UN History, but a personal
narrative about individual UN Peacekeepers and Congolese working on the ground,
based on our many years in the Congo as members of the MONUSCO Video Unit, and will be told in a personal, reflexive
style. The documentary will be in 5 parts, and narrator Clarke Peters will introduce
the themes of each part. (Please see  https://vimeo.com/97417755 for teaser)

We believe that a
documentary revealing the complexities and challenges confronting the world’s
largest and oldest UN Peacekeeping mission would be an ideal program to help commemorate
the 70 th Anniversary of the United Nations anywhere in the world.

</h3><blockquote>Our lives are relying more and more on technology.  As a result, it has often been said there is a continuing decline in human interaction and connection. The live streaming app Periscope, which combines live, in-the-moment video and text on mobile and tablet, has become a way to establish that human contact--something we as human beings need and crave.</blockquote><p>Film director and daily live streamer Alexis Cardoza found solace in Periscope after losing his brother suddenly. The app allowed him to find comfort by connecting with others during his time of need.  Since the release of the live streaming app in March 2015, Alexis has met hundreds of people around the world who hit the “start broadcast” button, allowing a peek into their lives through Periscope: some have risen to the ranks of Periscope celebrities, some are actual Hollywood stars, and others have overcome fears and obstacles in their personal lives, all due to a piece of technology. START BROADCAST is a documentary about their journey--what brought them to Periscope and what has transpired since hitting “start broadcast”.</p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p>In supporting the Indiegogo of START BROADCAST, you will be funding the documentation of the latest social media platform. Imagine if there was footage of the early days of <b>Apple with Steve Jobs &amp; Steve Wozniak</b> or <b>Facebook with Mark Zuckerberg</b>--how priceless those moments would be today in light of what these technological, life changing advances have become!  This documentary film will capture the early days of Periscope and live streaming which have already evolved in a quick span of time.  It is our hope that you will join us on our journey and become part of the START BROADCAST team by donating here on Indiegogo.</p><h3>Why Should I Back This Indiegogo? (Or, Why Should I Give You My Hard-Earned Cash?)</h3><p>Good question. We think there are a few good answers:</p><ul>
<li>First, as long as you give $25, you’ve pre-bought the movie. It’s a fair deal. You support a movie and some filmmakers you care about, and then you get to own the movie forever. We think it's better to sell you something than to just ask for a handout.</li>
<li>Third, and most importantly, is you will bring a movie about a dynamic community to life--by the community and for the community. Maybe you love Periscope and live streaming, or you love movies like START BROADCAST, or you’re friends with one of us.</li>
</ul><p>Regardless of the reason, just like Periscope, START BROADCAST wouldn’t exist without you.</p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>We understand that not everyone can donate funds and that's okay, here's how else you can help:</p><ul>

Who We Are:Alexis Cardoza/DirectorAlex's WebsiteAlexis IMDBBorn in Puerto Rico, raised in New Jersey he enlisted in the U.S. Marines right out of high school and served his country proudly.  He now spends his days creating content for YouTube® and is also a daily broadcaster on Persicope®.  Most of his videos on YouTube® consist of vlogs in which he either gives advice on certain mainstream guy related material or puts in his 2 cents on organic material in the tech world. He has worked with several high end production companies, owns a iRadio station (ClubZone.FM), and freelances in graphic and web design.Recently he finished and earned his degree in DIGITAL MEDIA TECHNOLOGY and is working on several documentaries.  The most recent a student film entitled PRESS RECORD.  Gretchen Pitluk/Producer/Director of PhotographyGretchen IMDBAfter graduating from Columbia College, Bend, Oregon called Gretchen Pitluk’s name, where she created local commercials at KTVZ NewsChannel 21.  Doing everything from pre to postproduction, she even revamped the local Blockbuster spots, which won her a few Addy and Drake Awards.  Pitluk also learned the ropes of live news directing and took over as the Senior Technical Director of the main evening newscasts on NBC and FOX.  With only two people running the shows, she was responsible for TDing, robotic cameras, video playback, and directing on each show–making her quite the capable multi-tasker.Missing Chi-Town, she brought her knowledge of video production back to the University of Illinois (UIC), where she was responsible for content creation and running the university’s television channel, HTV33. She has now taken up the task of post sound supervision at NoiseFloor, applying her skill set to The Golf Channel’s Our Longest Drive and spots for clients such as Clariol, Yoplait, and General Mills. Gretchen also has an ear for casting just the right voice or finding the perfect music for projects. She also freelances for Big Ten Network as a TD, an editor for HGTV, and currently edits/color corrects for indie films and webisodes.A.J Olstad/Sound RecorderA.J's IMDBA.J. Olstad developed his passion for sound from his love for watching films and wondering how the sounds were made and wanting to recreate them. This curiosity jump started his lifelong career in sound. A.J. Olstad graduated from Columbia College Chicago in Spring 2015 with a Bachelor of Arts in Audio for Visual Media. During his college career he was the sound designer for films that won in the Chicago International Film Festival as well as numerous other independent festivals. He also expanded his sound career being a location sound recorder. He went to places such as Sri Lanka, Wyoming, and Miami collaborating with many talented people and learning a different side of sound. After graduating, A.J. landed an internship with NoiseFloor Ltd. located in the heart of Chicago and quickly became acclimated to the professional clientele and workflow. He also freelances as a location sound recorder through NoiseFloor Ltd. but also from jobs that he obtains through his professional contacts. He takes each day as a learning opportunity and will for the rest of his career.Devin Delaney/Music Devin's IMDBOne score and seven years ago, in the Bay area of our beautiful nation’s 31st state, a child was born to a family of Chicago transplants. This child was named Devin, and little did the world know that henceforth Midwestern advertising music would be moderately impacted.Devin Delaney is NoiseFloor’s composer, music supervisor and all around music nerd. Since joining the NoiseFloor crew in 2010, Devin has composed music for clients such as Kohler, Cricket Wireless, Coors Light, Cadence Health, Brother P-Touch, McDonald’s, UPS, American Federation of Labor, Hefty, and many others. Devin created original scores for the iOS games Avengers Initiative: Hulk and Captain America, the indie feature The Moleman of Belmont Avenue as well as variety of short films. His favorite part of composition is that he gets to create and produce music within a wide variety of genres and styles.Dev grew up playing guitar, bass, and writing songs for  pop-rock bands in the ‘burbs of Chicago. His love of music production and modern composition led him to Berklee College of Music in Boston. He graduated magna cum laude with a dual major in Music Production & Engineering and Songwriting. In addition to playing a slew of stringed instruments, Devin is borderline obsessed with music technology. He is constantly seeking new sounds, samples, and software to enhance his creativity, sonic palette and efficiency.  Outside of NoiseFloor, Devin is an avid fan of the Chicago Bulls, video games, pretentious beer, cheese omelets, and soy lattes.",2.0,0,"5 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Jim Fidler left his home and family in Conception Bay South, Newfoundland at the age of 9 to attend the Halifax School for the blind where he would spend the next 9 years. This and inspirational story that shows how someone blind can overcome the obstacles he is faced with and not only thrive, but encourage others. </p>
<p>We will tell the story of how Jim met his Father for the first time in his early 20's and discovered that he has a rich musical heritage and 2 musician brothers and cousin, Christina Aguilera. </p>
<p>The film will paint a picture of the thriving St. John's music scene in the 80's and 90's in which Jim played a huge role. We have a multitude of musical guests including: Alan Doyle, The Navigators, The Secrets, Darrell Power, Colleen Power and many more. It will show how Newfoundland music has evolved and the rich culture and musical heritage. We also have international guests from Ireland, Scotland, France, The US, Canada and the Carribbean. </p>
<p>This film is in the final production stages with a launch planned on October 7th at the Geo Centre in St. John's. The screening will coincide with the launch of Jim's new album 'Signals from an Ancient Future.</p>
<p>The above video is a short promo, since then we've done a lot of work and you can see some of the interviews in the gallery.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The film is nearly completed. We have a date for the official screening of October 7th at the Geo Centre in St. John's.  </p>
<p>However, we still have some remaining production expenses. One of which is the purchase of some very very important footage from CTV. Just before Jim went completely blind at the age of 9, CTV came to Newfoundland with Uncle Bobby to do an interview with him. It's an amazing piece of footage and we really need it to complete the story. However the footage is going to cost about $4000.00, something that we just don't have in our budget :.) </p>
<p>We also need to purchase another piece of footage from CBC in Toronto - this is also a very important piece from a show called 'Ear to the Ground'. Not to give too much away but Jim and his reggae group Pressure Drop went to to Toronto to shoot for this very popular music show. The night before the shooting, Jim had an accident on the street in downtown Toronto. To make a long story short, he came home in a wheel chair, had two operations and was unable to walk for 6 months. After he recovered, Ear to the Ground came to St. John's to do the show on the group. It's very well done and we really need it.  The cost of this footage will be about $2000.00</p>
<p>The rest of the funds will go towards the manufacturing of a DVD of the film. </p>

</p><p><b>WHAT’S THE STORY? </b></p>
<p>My fictional short film <b>‘LETTERS’</b> is an exceptional story of a Indian man serving the British army who was in charge of

<p>Hi! My

journey as a filmmaker began in 2001 when after completing MBA from a top
business school in India and giving a lucrative corporate job, I came to Bombay
and worked in the film industry. During my formative years as a filmmaker I
worked as an assistant on some landmark films and with the biggest production
houses- Vinod Chopra Films and Yash Raj Films. I took a plunge to direct my own
films and in 2007 I made <b>‘KINDLE’</b> a psychological thriller, which was selected
and nominated at International festivals in Rome, Stuttgart, Karachi and
Florence. I also worked on Advertising films and worked on writing screenplays
for features. In 2016 I made another short film <b>‘RICE BOWL’</b> which was at the
Short Film Corner, Cannes and has been selected for film festivals in Karakoy (Turkey)
and Hague (Netherlands). It is still expecting results from a lot of festivals.

My fictional short film ‘LETTERS’ is an exceptional story of a Indian man serving the British army who was in charge of
censoring letters during the World War 2. The uniqueness of the subject is that though it's fiction but it's set in
1944 ITALY during the Battle of MONTE CASSINO which was actually fought. The film draws lot of inspiration from the real letters written by soldiers to their
families.  This film will take us back in time which was one of the darkest
periods of human history. Our story is emotional and yet engaging and will
touch you deeply.WHAT IS 'LETTER CENSORSHIP'? Letter censorship started during World War 1 and even continued in World War 2. It was basically to advise servicemen and other citizens to avoid careless talks concerning secure information that might be of use to the enemy. And one way of doing so was by CENSORING LETTERS.WHERE CAN THE FILM GO?
Such a
subject dealing with Nazis and World Wars have always been a favourite at
prestigious film festivals and for international awards whether it’s the
Oscars, BAFTA or the Cannes. My effort is to make the film of that standard
and quality so it can compete at that level. And you valuable contribution to

 ____________________________________________ ""PIIGS"" - Feature lenght documentary   ""PIIGS"" - Documentario lungometraggioPIIGS is a movie halfway between Inside Job (2010 documentary about USA 2008 financial crisis) and the “proletarian tales” by Ken Loach.      PIIGS è un film a metà strada tra Inside Job (documentario del 2010 sulla crisi finanziaria  USA) e le storie proletarie di Ken Loach.PIIGS is an exciting and revolutionary journey into the very heart of the tragic European economic crisis. This extraordinary documentary - made by the three filmmakers after five years of research and two years of shooting - is a Southern European take into austerity dogma and states with the voice of prestigious international economists, intellectuals and experts, that the origin of the European debt crisis is not the inadequacy of people in crisis countries but the very foundation of euro itself.       È un viaggio affascinante e rivoluzionario nel cuore della tragica crisi economica europea. Realizzato da tre filmmaker dopo cinque anni di ricerche e due di riprese, PIIGS è un'immersione senza precedenti  e senza censure nei dogmi dell'austerity e afferma con la voce di prestigiosi economisti, intellettuali ed esperti internazionali che l'origine della crisi dei debiti europei non risiede nell'inadeguatezza delle popolazioni dei Paesi in crisi ma nelle fondamenta stesse dell'euro.  Unfortunately people are not immune to bad decision making, and the documentary shows how austerity turns into practice in Rome, focusing on a survival story of a cooperative assisting disabled people.      Il documentario racconta anche le dirette conseguenze dell'austerity a Roma, concentrandosi sulla storia della sopravvivenza di una Cooperativa sociale che assiste disabili e persone svantaggiate.Outskirts of Rome, today. Claudia is trying to save the Cooperative company “Il Pungiglione” (“The Sting”) from bankrupt. “Il Pungiglione"" is owed an amount of 1 million euros from municipality and Region and risks of closing down forever: 100 workers will remain unemployed and 150 disabled/autistic people won’t have any further assistance. It’s a ticking time social bomb.      Dintorni di Roma, oggi. Claudia sta provando a salvare la Cooperativa ""Il Pungiglione"" dal fallimento. ""Il Pungiglione"" ha un credito di un milione di euro dal comune e dalla regione e rischia di chiudere per sempre: 100 dipendenti perderanno il lavoro e 150 disabili rimarranno senza assistenza. È una bomba sociale a orologeria. Is it true that in the Euro zone there is no alternative to Austerity, to Fiscal Compact, to budget balance, to welfare spendig cuts? To the bankrupt of ""Il Pungiglione""?       È vero che nell'Eurozona non c'è alternativa all'austerity, al Fiscal Compact, al pareggio di bilancio, ai tagli alla spesa sociale? Al fallimento del ""Pungiglione""?         What they say about ""PIIGS""     Cosa dicono di ""PIIGS""              [""Wonderful editing, great rhythm, engaging story, a perfect framework"".        Marcello Paolillo, Nexo Digital]              [""Montato egregiamente, incalzante, avvincente, con una struttura perfetta"". M. Paolillo, Nexo Digital]              [""Technically excellent. The story of the Cooperative is really touching!""

Camillo De Marco, Cineuropa]                  [""Un'immersione senza precedenti e senza censure nelle origini della crisi economica"". Camillo De Marco su Cineuropa.org]                [""PIIGS teaser trailer looks pretty good! It looks to be strong on MMT"". Stephanie Kelton]                 [""Il teaser di PIIGS è molto bello! Inoltre è molto attinente alla MMT"" . Stephanie Kelton]  PIIGS could be one of the most important documentary of these last 8 years, since the economic crisis started: it debunks those austerity dogmas which are  dramatically impoverishing Europe.      PIIGS potrebbe essere uno dei più importanti documentari degli ultimi 8 anni, da quando cioè la crisi economica è iniziata: smaschera quei dogmi dell'austerità che stanno drammaticamente impoverendo l'Europa.  
Who are we
   Chi siamoWe are three Italian award-winning independent filmmakers. Our works always focused on delicate matters like immigration, poverty, politics, economics, terrorism, as well as cinema, visual art, literature. We made feature films, documentaries, short movies, webseries.      Siamo tre filmmaker indipendenti italiani. Con i nostri lavori ci siamo occupati di argomenti delicati come immigrazione, povertà, politica, economia, terrorismo, ma anche di cinema, arti visive, letteratura. Abbiamo realizzato lungometraggi, documentari, cortometraggi e webserie.Stanley and Us - All'ombra del gigante - Voci migranti - Spread Zero   (from left)Adriano Cutraro,Mirko Melchiorre,Federico Greco    This time we decided to investigate prevalent European budgetary policies and the austerity dogma. Because we believe that precisely those dogmas produce poverty, unemployment, social conflicts.     Stavolta abbiamo deciso di indagare i dogmi dell'austerità e le politiche monetarie dominanti in Europa. Perché crediamo che esattamente quei dogmi stiano producendo povertà, disoccupazione e conflitti sociali.As Italians piigs we want to understand how and why we became ""pigs"". Is it because we're lazy? Or maybe because we are tax evaders?    We also feel that we MUST do something to understand what's happening to that ""Europe of the people"" its foundig fathers dreamed.      In quanto ""maiiali"" italiani, vogliamo capire come e perché siamo diventati maiali. È perché siamo pigri? O perché siamo evasori?      Inoltre sentiamo di DOVER fare qualcosa per capire cosa sta succedendo a quell' ""Europa dei popoli"" che i padri fondatori sognavano.And what's happening to Italy...      E cosa sta succedendo all'Italia...

  What's the documentary about?      Di cosa parla il documentario?Did you know that the famous god-like Stability and Growth Pact with its 3% deficit limit and theories about critical government debt levels are based on purely invented figures and typing errors in Excel spreadsheet?      Sapevi che il famoso Patto di stabilità e crescita col suo limite del 3% del deficit e le teorie sul livello critico del debito del 60% sono basate su calcoli inventati ed errori di Excel?                          However, austerity policies keep on dividing the continent into winners and loosers, creating great amount of suffering, particularly in so-called crisis countries (PIIGS). Consequently, the whole European project has become in doubt.      Nonostante ciò, le politiche di austerity continuano a dividere il continente in vincitori e vinti, creando grande sofferenza in particolare nei Paesi in crisi detti PIIGS. Ecco perché l'intero progetto dell'Unione europea inizia a scricchiolare.  The documentary features Noam Chomsky (linguist, philisopher), Stephanie Kelton (Chief Economist for US Senate Budget Committee), Warren Mosler (financial insider, monetary expert), Paul De Grauwe (Professor London School of Economics), Yanis Varoufakis (ex Greek Minister of Finance), Marshall Auerback (Research associate, Levy Economics Institute), Erri De Luca (Italian novelist), Vladimiro Giacchè (economist) Federico Rampini (Italian journalist), Paolo Barnard (independent investigative journalist), among others.      Nel documentario intervengono, tra gli altri, Noam Chomsky (linguista, filosofo), Stephanie Kelton (economista capo presso la minoranza Democratica della commissione bilancio del Senato USA), Warren Mosler (insider finanziario, esperto di sistemi monetari), Paul De Grauwe (professore alla London School of Economics), Yanis Varoufakis (ex ministro greco delle finanze), Marshall Auerback (Levy Economics Institute), Erri De Luca (poeta, scrittore, giornalista), Vladimiro Giacchè (economista), Federico Rampini (giornalista La Repubblica), Paolo Barnard (giornalista investigativo indipendente).         ​                      What We Need       Di cosa abbiamo bisognoThe film is in post-production now and we’ve already found  70% of the budget. We’re looking for 30.000€ to complete post-production. We need to raise the funds to be able to make ""PIIGS"" as powerful as we know it can be.      Il film è in post-produzione (montaggio) e abbiamo quindi già trovato e speso il 70% del budget. Abbiamo bisogno di 30.000€ per completare la post produzione secondo gli alti standard tecnici internazionali. I fondi ci servono quindi per rendere ""PIIGS"" potente come sappiamo che potrà essere.Italian theatrical distributors expressed a firm interest in PIIGS (offering a theatrical release on January 2017), as well as an international film distribution company (Berta Film).      Distributori  cinematografici italiani hanno espresso un forte interesse per PIIGS, offrendo un'uscita cinematografica per gennaio 2017; così come una distribuzione televisiva internazionale (Berta Film) What your funding supports
Post-production including sound and color
Footage licensing fees
Mastering Digital Cinema Package (DCP) and Bluray (for theater screenings) 
Legal counsel

Of course, we are also planning on submitting “PIIGS” to a lot of international festivals in 2016 and 2017.     A cosa serve il vostro aiuto
Post produzione (compreso color grading e mix)
Acquisto diritti clip di repertorio
Masterizzazione del DCP e del Bluray (per la proiezione in sala)
Consulenza legale

Promozione
     Ovviamente, stiamo presentando PIIGS ai più importanti festival internazionali del 2016 e 2017. What we already have      Cosa abbiamo già
72' and 55' excellent drafts of the documentary (English and Italian versions)
A combative International Sales Agent (Berta Film) who believes in the project, Stefano Mutolo.

   Why don't you get it done by yourself?      Perché non fate tutto da soli?Because we should wait for a producer and his money, and it could take years.       Perché l'attesa di un produttore potrebbe durare anni.  You can help us also by spreading the word and this page.It would have the same substance that supporting us with your money.If the infos above are not enough, ask one of the directors HERE. Puoi lo stesso aiutarci diffondendo questa pagina e facendo parlare di noi e del film.

<h3>ABOUT HANNAH YUMI</h3>
<p>I am currently a senior at Liberty University and have been preparing for this film since the beginning of this year. Because this is my senior thesis, I am directing and producing it; however, my real passion lies in film makeup and thus have centered the entire story around symbolism that will be reflected through the makeup.</p>
<p>This film is incredibly important to me because the inspiration for this film came from seeing the trend in media (and our culture as a whole) that beats into young minds that in order to be considered beautiful or successful, you need to fit into a certain box. Anyone who doesn't fit into that box is deemed ugly or just not good enough.</p>
<p>There are already many figures and films promoting body positivity out there, but mine is from a little bit of a different perspective. The point I am trying to get across to anyone who watches this is that there will always be critics and people who hate on you throughout your entire life. But despite what others think of you or how they treat you, you as a person need to be confident in yourself and love yourself for who you are and not because of what others say. You are beautiful because you are you. Not because of others opinions.</p>

What We Need & What You Get
My team and I will be shooting at the end of this October and will greatly appreciate it if you were a part of it!
Things that your contribution will go to include:
Feeding the crew!
Most people think that working on a film is one of the most glamorous jobs you can have. I   know I thought that before. That could not be any further from the truth! Making a film (even a short film) requires hours of heavy duty work at all hours of the day or night. Hence, feeding the crew well is extremely important so that no one is working without proper nourishment!
Transportation
Some members of my crew will be coming from out of state, and we will need to take care of gas money for them. Also moving equipment from location to location and transporting cast and crew adds up as well.
Makeup
As you know, my film is very makeup oriented, and makeup is not cheap. Especially good brands that won't make the cast break out.
Props and Costumes
These are essential parts of a film and each item will add up.
There are just a few of the many things that your contribution will go to, and this is only naming a few of the pre-production/production costs. There is also post production to think about such as licensing music, editing and coloring the footage, etc.
In return for your generous contributions, you will be receiving certain items or credit in the film depending on the amount that you contribute.

The Impact
Your contribution will help me and my team pull together a film that will reach out to people struggling with problems in their lives.

We hope to present to the viewers the meanings behind the film through subtleties within the film. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1483778439/oxleg4j81inieoedyhgt.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>- Still from <i>Let's Be Civil, Kenneth!</i></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1483772792/i1qsym2ru5bpc1ir5vqu.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1483862339/lngzsrpy42bbehwzalqt.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Neil Lim (Neil)</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Director</strong></p><p>NEIL LIM started out as a rock star hopeful in his teenage years, playing in bands and writing originals that saw 8 band albums, radio airplay and exclusives, in addition to several performances at the Arts House and Esplanade.

In this film, we want to broadcast exclusive footage from Nepal for you and conduct scientific research on TSB’s and make more people experience this beautiful and powerful transformation journey.</p><p>Due to everyday stress our bodies often fall out of vibrational harmony and potentially develop illness. Stress and negativity create blockages of healthy flow of energy. In our film, we want to explore how human well-being can be improved with the use of Tibetan Singing Bowls.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Exclusive footage and interviews from Nepal</strong></h3><p>Our documentary film consists of two parts. First part is travelling and documenting live workshops and getting exclusive footage from Nepal and Nepalese teachers, keepers of the ancient tradition, covering: history and ancient techniques of playing singing bowls; revealing secrets and legends, temples and methods of bowls casting.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Research &amp; Meditation</strong></h3><p>Second part is the research where we interview Sound Masters, therapies recipients and scientists from Oxford and around the world, and specialists from other fields. We look deeply into TSB's effect on human body and mind. We also wish to conduct a series of musical concerts for children and adults with certain conditions (TBC) and track the changes in their physical well-being and emotional state. Singing Bowls’ sound puts you in a deep meditative state, allowing you to travel deep inside yourself.</p><p> </p><p><strong>A word from Niina, Film Producer:</strong></p><p><i>I became very passionate about Tibetan Singing Bowls after I experienced this beautiful and deep relaxing feeling, which activated something else within me. I decided to know more about it, I learnt Contact Method technique, and I’ve performed over 40 sessions to various people. All my patients wake up after the session and tell me that they went through a very unusual transformation in them, and they feel so beautifully tranquil, and that they were on a very intimate emotional journey. </i></p><p><i>I believe that Sound Medicine is one of the most powerful natural tool for physical and emotional well-being. Since I’ve got into it, my stomach pain has gone, and every time I play TSB, it gives me so much energy! I’m sure that pretty soon sound healing will be officially used in hospitals and schools, and that is just a start. I would like people to experience it themselves, it’s much stronger than any words. I hope this film will open for you a new useful knowledge and give a good objective overview of the impact TSB sound can have on us.</i></p><p> </p><h2><strong>What We Need</strong></h2><p>So far it’s been all self- funded and is being made on the enthusiasm, so we need your support!</p><p>The contributions gained through Indiegogo will allow us to fly and cover costs of filming in Nepal, to continue what we have already started in London. YOU will enable us to continue production process. We’re in touch with many more people and organisations to be part of the film, we continue our research, we have more subjects lined up, and have partner organisations - at this point, we just need to physically be in Nepal to progress further. £12,000 is just the minimum amount and it will go towards equipment rental, flights, transportation within the country, cost of living, and hiring a translator and crew.

In this film, we want to broadcast exclusive footage from Nepal for you and conduct scientific research on TSB’s and make more people experience this beautiful and powerful transformation journey.Due to everyday stress our bodies often fall out of vibrational harmony and potentially develop illness. Stress and negativity create blockages of healthy flow of energy. In our film, we want to explore how human well-being can be improved with the use of Tibetan Singing Bowls. Exclusive footage and interviews from NepalOur documentary film consists of two parts. First part is travelling and documenting live workshops and getting exclusive footage from Nepal and Nepalese teachers, keepers of the ancient tradition, covering: history and ancient techniques of playing singing bowls; revealing secrets and legends, temples and methods of bowls casting. Research & MeditationSecond part is the research where we interview Sound Masters, therapies recipients and scientists from Oxford and around the world, and specialists from other fields. We look deeply into TSB's effect on human body and mind. We also wish to conduct a series of musical concerts for children and adults with certain conditions (TBC) and track the changes in their physical well-being and emotional state. Singing Bowls’ sound puts you in a deep meditative state, allowing you to travel deep inside yourself. A word from Niina, Film Producer:I became very passionate about Tibetan Singing Bowls after I experienced this beautiful and deep relaxing feeling, which activated something else within me. I decided to know more about it, I learnt Contact Method technique, and I’ve performed over 40 sessions to various people. All my patients wake up after the session and tell me that they went through a very unusual transformation in them, and they feel so beautifully tranquil, and that they were on a very intimate emotional journey. I believe that Sound Medicine is one of the most powerful natural tool for physical and emotional well-being. Since I’ve got into it, my stomach pain has gone, and every time I play TSB, it gives me so much energy! I’m sure that pretty soon sound healing will be officially used in hospitals and schools, and that is just a start. I would like people to experience it themselves, it’s much stronger than any words. I hope this film will open for you a new useful knowledge and give a good objective overview of the impact TSB sound can have on us. What We NeedSo far it’s been all self- funded and is being made on the enthusiasm, so we need your support!The contributions gained through Indiegogo will allow us to fly and cover costs of filming in Nepal, to continue what we have already started in London. YOU will enable us to continue production process. We’re in touch with many more people and organisations to be part of the film, we continue our research, we have more subjects lined up, and have partner organisations - at this point, we just need to physically be in Nepal to progress further. £12,000 is just the minimum amount and it will go towards equipment rental, flights, transportation within the country, cost of living, and hiring a translator and crew. This money will not cover our post-production costs, but will allow us to get footage that will in turn make us stronger candidates for film grants down the line. We are also already in communication with a number of foundations who are interested in supporting the film, but would like to see some footage.

I took that response, along with solid feedback from Kiwi filmmakers &amp; cut a version of the film I am ready to give to the world.</p><p>In the upcoming month, I begin submitting to top-tier film festivals, but before we screen, TPH needs the final score, colour, &amp; sound design completed. Typically, I'm a one-man-post-production-band, but I feel this project is worthy of so much more than what I can do alone. I need to bring in other talented people to make this film better than I could have imagined.</p><p>Who would have thought a little film from South Arkansas would have the chance to work with Park Road Post (The Lord of the Rings, King Kong, District 9)? Not me for sure.

I took that response, along with solid feedback from Kiwi filmmakers & cut a version of the film I am ready to give to the world.In the upcoming month, I begin submitting to top-tier film festivals, but before we screen, TPH needs the final score, colour, & sound design completed. Typically, I'm a one-man-post-production-band, but I feel this project is worthy of so much more than what I can do alone. I need to bring in other talented people to make this film better than I could have imagined.Who would have thought a little film from South Arkansas would have the chance to work with Park Road Post (The Lord of the Rings, King Kong, District 9)?

<p>Pavel Trofimovich Morozov, better known by the diminutive Pavlik, was a Soviet youth praised by the Soviet press as a martyr. His story, dated to 1932, is that of a 13-year-old boy who denounced his father to the authorities and was in turn killed by his family. His story was a subject of reading, songs, plays, a symphonic poem, a full-length opera and six biographies. The cult propaganda had a huge impact on the moral norms of generations of school children, who were encouraged to inform on their parents. Also, in Nazi Germany 97% of all public school teachers, some 300,000 persons, had joined the National Socialist Teachers League by 1936. In fact, teachers joined the Nazi Party in greater numbers than any other profession.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are three final year television production students studying at Bournemouth University in Bournemouth, England. We are all incredibly passionate, devoted students from diverse backgrounds, and are interested in the chance to tell a story as unique and controversial as this. This project has the potential to shed light on the life of the Royal Kumari, not only as a religious and cultural icon but as a young child and girl living in Nepal. </p>
<p>As women in the film industry, we are all incredibly passionate about the importance of diverse, female-driven storytelling both on and off-screen. With the help of contributors, this documentary could highlights a unique and controversial part of Nepal's culture and the world surrounding this child goddess and what the Kumari means to this country, culture, and its people.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Funds that are contributed to this project will be going directly to the production of the short film, and are divided below:</p>
<p>35% - Transportation</p>
<p>25% - Accommodation</p>
<p>20% - Craft</p>
<p>20% - Contributor costs</p>
<p>This project has also received a grant from Global Horizons at Bournemouth University, and the funds from this will be added to the money raised here to contribute to our travel expenses and other production costs</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project in incredibly valuable not only to you as a contributor, but to the rest of the world who may have never heard of the Kumari before. </p>
<p>As a part of our course at Bournemouth University, we have successfully produced several documentaries and short films such as this, and are excited about the unique challenge that this project presents. </p>
<p>According to a record, Kumari started in the 5th century to protect the country and to maintain a balance between religion and culture. It is part of the unique characteristic culture of Nepal that you won’t be able to see from other countries. Every single move that she makes as the living Kumari is sacred. Nepalese Kumaris are worshipped for about 10 years starting when the girl is between two and five years old. You will gain an unparalleled insight into the Nepalese sacred culture in a visual way whilst watching this documentary. We have unique access with the Nepalese fixer, who has a good relationship with the Kumari care taker in Kathmandu. It will give the audiences an amazing opportunity to meet the actual living goddess, who is difficult and rare for even a Nepalese to see, all from the comfort of their living room.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are obviously many challenges involved with this project, and obstacles that we may face on our way to achieving this goal.</p>
<p>We will be working in close connection with our tutors at Bournemouth University to ensure that all risks have been assessed and the project is as safe and secure as possible for everyone involved. Your contributions for helping in production costs will assist in ensuring that a project like this is feasible considering these challenges.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are fluent in Nepalese or can assist in translating Nepalese to English, this would be extremely beneficial and appreciated!</p>
<p>Please share this indiegogo campaign to spread the word about this documentary project and the fascinating world of the Kumari.</p>

<p>We know that €20,000 is a huge amount. Here's where your contribution will go:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actor/Crew payment 18% - Working on a film is hard work (as well as being fun) and we think that the cast and crew deserve to be compensated for their efforts.</li>
<li>Travel/Location 8% - Getting where you need to go in Ireland is not always as straightforward as it should be, especially in small towns and rural areas.</li>
<li>Food 12% - We need to eat, so do the crew and cast.</li>
<li>Equipment 44% - Sound Equipment, Lights, Lenses and Camera all of these items will contribute to making the finished film better quality.</li>
<li>Insurance 10% - The not so fun expense.</li>
<li>Indiegogo fees 8%</li>

We know that €20,000 is a huge amount. Here's where your contribution will go:

Actor/Crew payment 18% - Working on a film is hard work (as well as being fun) and we think that the cast and crew deserve to be compensated for their efforts.
Travel/Location 8% - Getting where you need to go in Ireland is not always as straightforward as it should be, especially in small towns and rural areas.
Food 12% - We need to eat, so do the crew and cast.
Equipment 44% - Sound Equipment, Lights, Lenses and Camera all of these items will contribute to making the finished film better quality.
Insurance 10% - The not so fun expense.
Indiegogo fees 8%

 

We plan to make ""Shatter"" no matter what. This is a project we are excited about and and we have put so much work in already we will not be turning back.

<p>Hi, I'm Chris!</p>
<p>Playing the Wing Commander games as a teenager inspired me to become an Aerospace Engineer. Now, as an adult, I am paying back that inspiration.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>I am a Star Citizen!</strong></p>
<p>Since the early days of the Star Citizen campaign there has been a significant UK fan base and there have been discussions, since those early days, about a large annual meetup in the UK. CitizenCon 2015, in Manchester, proved that there was an appetite for this annual UK meetup but there is no official CIG event in the UK every year because CitizenCon rotates between locations, so we decided to run our own event. Thus, <strong>BritizenCon</strong> was born!</p>
<p>BritizenCon, in July 2016, was a spectacular success. But, we want next year's to be bigger and better! This is where you come in:</p>

""</p><p>My film is structured like a Charlie Kaufman movie in that there are time jumps and flashbacks. The tone is very similar toTodd Solondz. I'm a big fan. I borrow from the greats. ; ) So, lot's of dark laughs, forced perspective, and  rich character archetypes that ring true...(More about the story...later in my campaign)</p><p><strong><u>WHY YOU BUGGING US FOR  MONEY, CLARKE?</u></strong></p><p>Fair question. Earlier this year, we shopped this script to production houses and studios. Money people. I called all my celebrity kick ass actor friends and asked if they would do the film. They agreed. So with an impressive cast attached, we had some bites and nibbles. We were hoping to get at the very least $600,000 to make our little independent movie... but finding funding proved daunting and more than time consuming. I decided to take matters into my own hands. I could produce it myself if I tried a crowdfunding campaign.  <br/><br/><u><strong>THE SUBJECT MATTER: DEATH AND RELATIONSHIPS</strong></u></p><p>Hollywood isn't so quick to embrace a film about death. Challenging subject? Oh yes...but one that we all deal with eventually. Right? Why not a story about it? When I went through the experience of losing my dad, I couldn't believe how unprepared I was. Those last two weeks of his life. Nobody wants to talk about that time in the process of losing a loved one. The hard times....</p><p>Well, I saw a story there. And it all came together in my head.

But guilt and a strange sense of destiny forces him to get on a plane.  Once he lands---he has to face his family, his past ---basically everything he's been running away from for the last 20 years. ""My film is structured like a Charlie Kaufman movie in that there are time jumps and flashbacks. The tone is very similar toTodd Solondz. I'm a big fan. I borrow from the greats. ; ) So, lot's of dark laughs, forced perspective, and  rich character archetypes that ring true...(More about the story...later in my campaign)WHY YOU BUGGING US FOR  MONEY, CLARKE?Fair question. Earlier this year, we shopped this script to production houses and studios. Money people. I called all my celebrity kick ass actor friends and asked if they would do the film. They agreed. So with an impressive cast attached, we had some bites and nibbles. We were hoping to get at the very least $600,000 to make our little independent movie... but finding funding proved daunting and more than time consuming. I decided to take matters into my own hands. I could produce it myself if I tried a crowdfunding campaign.  THE SUBJECT MATTER: DEATH AND RELATIONSHIPSHollywood isn't so quick to embrace a film about death. Challenging subject? Oh yes...but one that we all deal with eventually. Right? Why not a story about it? When I went through the experience of losing my dad, I couldn't believe how unprepared I was. Those last two weeks of his life. Nobody wants to talk about that time in the process of losing a loved one. The hard times....Well, I saw a story there. And it all came together in my head.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>For those of you who don't know me very well, my name is Jon Anderson, and I'm a third year directing student at Columbia College Chicago. Brain Teaser--though through the lens of a much different character than myself--is a deeply personal film, as it tackles a lot of the struggles I dealt with in my last two years here at film school. I've always been extremely hard on myself, which has made the prospect of failure much more difficult to accept than it should be. I would find myself despairing because I wasn't good enough, and getting angry at myself for not being better. But we all know what it's like to fail, and we all know what it's like to fail a lot, over and over again. My hope with this film is to reach those who have either struggled or are struggling now to find genuine purpose from within, and to expose the ridiculous things we sometimes tell ourselves to prevent us from being satisfied with who we are. In order to make this a reality though, we need your help! Any amount you donate will help bring us one step closer to achieving the professional look and feel necessary for this film to be seen by the masses. So not only will you be supporting the aspirations of a gifted crew of hardworking film students, but because of you, something beautiful and transformative will come into existence. Beautiful! Transformative! Because of you!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our total budget for this film is right around the $4000 mark, which is actually quite modest for a production of this scale. Your contribution will go primarily toward feeding our dedicated cast and crew, providing transportation of equipment and personnel to and from set, creating an expressive yet believable environment through costuming and production design, as well as a variety of smaller logistical costs like securing locations and backing up footage once everything is shot.</p>
<p>In exchange for your generosity and support, I have a few perks to offer--many of which are unique keepsakes from set--which I hope will serve as a heartfelt reminder of the very special artistic achievement you were able to make possible.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with any production, professional or otherwise, there are always risks, and things are guaranteed to go awry in some way or another. The beauty of this medium though is that with careful preparation and a team of sharp, talented individuals, we can overcome any obstacle that is thrown our way.</p>
<p>With this being said, the biggest challenge we face with this production in particular is going to be with time. There is a good amount of story to cover and only four days to do it, so between selecting the best shots and staging the more difficult ones, the clock will be constantly ringing in my ear like a glockenspiel.</p>
<p>Nevertheless though, this will be the fourth film I've directed at Columbia on a larger scale, and my entire crew has spent immeasurable hours practicing their craft and mastering their abilities on set, so I have the upmost confidence in our adaptive abilities.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you're not able to support us financially but would still like to help make this project a reality, do us a huge favor and share our Indiegogo page with the world on social media! It never hurts to get people excited about an interesting upcoming film, and you never know who's got a rich uncle in Luxembourg out there somewhere.</p>
