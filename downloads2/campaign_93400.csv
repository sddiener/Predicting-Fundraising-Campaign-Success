Hello, I am Gábor Matyasi an oral surgeon and a fine art photographer, founder of the Hungarian Society of Dental Photography.My aim is to spread the importance and usefulness of dental photography more widely, and to make the camera an everyday device such as the mirror or the drill in the practice. This interactive textbook is designed to serve this purpose.Not just reading - InteractingIt’s time to tun a new page on learning. On iPad, textbooks invite Multi‑Touch interaction — flick through photo galleries, rotate 3D objects, tap to pop up sidebars, or play video and audio. With iBooks, reading is beyond fundamental. And more engaging than ever.I have tried to make photography, optical term definitions and sometimes the dry rules of physics more colourful with a spectacular, unique, informative and in some cases humorous visual material. I hope to produce a useful, easily understandable and entertaining volume. I particularly enjoyed the formation of creative elements, it has been a great fun for me while learning a lot.Some randomly selected interactive widgets ...

It starts with the basics of optics and photography


We will look through the accessories and devices of dental photography


I will explain how to set your camera.


I will show the standard intraoral views according to the European and AACD protocol, as well.

The different portrait techniques.


The most common errors in dental photography.

Every chapter ends with tests and tasks to check your knowledge :)

editor from Croatia. I travel a lot and make all sorts of photos. However I am
especially passionate about a handful of my favorite motifs. One of my
favorite photo series is called <b>Expiations</b>, featuring religious temples from
all over the world. Catholic, Muslim, Protestant, Hindu, Jewish, Sikh,
Orthodox Christian, Sunni, Shiite, Buddhist, you name it, I photographed it.
<br/>
<br/><p>I recommend taking a look at my first Indiegogo campaign
for the series Without People, some additional explanations regarding plans and
motives for the ""Big Picture"" are explained there. The basic idea is
to do three photo projects in three years – <b>Without People</b> (abandoned and dehumanized
places), <b>Expiations</b> (religious temples), and as yet unnamed third
project. The first part of the project – Without People – went very well,
thanks to your support. The funding goals were reached and surpassed, the
stretch goal reached as well. The book is available on Amazon, <strong><span>It's a great gift for travelers,
introverts, loners or survival freaks. </span></strong>Large size prints for
international customers are available on Crated. Local Croatian customers
interested in buying one of these large format prints – please contact me directly
via e-mail or Facebook.<br/><br/>Without People on Amazon: <a href=""http://amzn.com/1494484846"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>http://amzn.com/1494484846</u></a></p><p>Without People campaign on Indiegogo: <a href=""http://igg.me/at/withoutpeople/x/5894566"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://igg.me/at/withoutpeople/x/5894566</a></p><p>Selected photos from Without People on Crated: <a href=""https://crated.com/oleg.mastruko"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>https://crated.com/oleg.mastruko</u></a></p>
<p><b>Now it's time for the second part of the planned trilogy
– Expiations!</b></p>
<p>In the meantime I got some experience regarding
self-publishing a book, so the sum I am looking for in this campaign is
actually LOWER, perks cost LESS, and yet I can promise that the book will be
delivered much QUICKER than Without People, my first photo book. The book itself
will also feature more photos than Without People.</p>
<p>By streamlining the
production process I managed to cut cost considerably, and can do a beautiful
book for a relatively modest sum. I need money to cover the production costs –
DTP, proofreading, printing... also, the campaign is the easiest way for you to buy the book.</p>
<p><strong>By pledging your
support for this project, you get to participate in what will be a unique
photographic document of places and locations that are changing basically every

<div>The book will not be heavy on text, only a couple paragraphs on over thirty cities and towns throughout North Carolina, and it will feature hundreds of incredible full color pictures.  The idea is to give people an overall taste of what North Carolina is all about whether they are planning on visiting the area, or if they have lived here their whole lives.  It's really a tribute to the state and it's beauty and also its people!  In the future it will serve as an historical benchmark or what life may have been like in the approximate year of 2014 &amp; 2015 because it will showcase the approximate populations of each area, and naturally fashions people wear will change, and businesses will come and go, so it will be a fun way to reflect back at how NC used to be.<br/>
</div>
<div>We have been publishing high quality books and magazines for over twenty years.  The last two books we published were both sold in select Barnes &amp; Noble book stores, on Amazon, &amp; one was even sold at Costco.  We have interviewed &amp; photographed notable people from around the world from reknown scientists to celebrities &amp; musicians including Pierce Brosnan, Ted Danson, Yoko Ono, Jason Mraz, Jack Johnson, Daryl Hannah, and dozens of others, and our photography has been featured in magazines &amp; newspapers from the LA Times to the New York Times, Golf Magazine, Coast Magazine &amp; over forty others.  We tell you this only to explain that we take our jobs &amp; reputations very seriously, and we are very proud of the way this book has been turning out. We are  passionate about the state we live in and that's why we're also commited to working on promoting North Carolina every single day on line, this is much more than just a book to us! <br/>

<div>We are trying to raise $47,000 in order to get our book printed and to pay our hard working graphic artists! Our goal is to publish at least 5000 copies of the book and naturally the more editions we can afford to do the better! We have spent well over $50,000 already of our own hard earned money to get this project off the ground (basically all we had - that's how much we believe in this project).  We have travelled all over the state for the last year and have acquired more tax write-off than we need on gasoline, restaurants, exhibition tickets, and hotels! </div>
<div>We started a Facebook page a few months ago which already has just reached 7000 likes! As proud of that number as we are, ""likes"" don't pay the bills! We feel like we should be working for the department of tourism to be honest but unfortunately we are not and that's why we need you!  If you support us we will reward you in many different ways, and no dollar amount is to low for us to appreciate it! : ) We are offering an array of perks listed on this page. </div>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact:</h3>
<div>When you support the this campaign, you are supporting local small business people who give the money dierctly back to the communities we live in.  This book will not be printed in China, despite the fact it would cost less, this book will be printed right here in the good ol' USA!  And our graphics people live here too!  And by supporting this book you are not only helping us, you are actually helping to preserve the history of North Carolina! And we will do our best to represent the state in a way that would make most of our people proud too (we won't lie &amp; say every single person will love it, but we hope we'd at least get a simple majority even though it's a non-political book). </div>
<div>By supporting this campaign you also help us to keep our social media going, it's not cheap, or easy getting new info to post ever single day ot the week!  And we have an amazing track record in statistics on facebook so far - we have a higher participation than 80+% of all websites in the state! </div>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges:</h3>
<div>Without the kind of support we actually need just means that we won't be able to have the book out immediately, but it does not mean we won't make the book!  If we could print 10,000 books on our first run we would! (in fact in the outside chance we do get enough funding we will print even more)! We are that confident that they will all sell! Our goal is to have the digital version of the book out by the first week of December, and the hard covered version of the book will be out in July.  Every person who buys a hard covered version of the book will also receive the digital version as well.  It's like a two for one because both books will be different! </div>

By supporting this campaign you also help us to keep our social media going, it's not cheap, or easy getting new info to post ever single day ot the week!  And we have an amazing track record in statistics on facebook so far - we have a higher participation than 80+% of all websites in the state! 

  Risks & Challenges:
Without the kind of support we actually need just means that we won't be able to have the book out immediately, but it does not mean we won't make the book!  If we could print 10,000 books on our first run we would! (in fact in the outside chance we do get enough funding we will print even more)! We are that confident that they will all sell! Our goal is to have the digital version of the book out by the first week of December, and the hard covered version of the book will be out in July.  Every person who buys a hard covered version of the book will also receive the digital version as well.  It's like a two for one because both books will be different! 

  Other Ways You Can Help: Some people just can't afford to contribute financially, but that doesn't mean you can't help!   You can ask friends to get the word out and make some noise about this campaign if you want to see it happen!  And you can tell your own social media friends about it.  And Hey - we go by the trust system, if you tell us that you told all your friends even though you have no dinero yourself, we will still send you a signed postcard if you just let us know! : )",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Why I need your help</h3>
<p>Your much needed contribution will help me to raise the funds to cover the printing and framing costs to make my first ever solo exhibition possible!</p>
<p>Having spent the last year testing out the best fine art printing and framing that most effectively showcases my work, I'll be printing on museum grade archival Hahnemühle Photo Rag. Each print will then be set in a handmade frame using raw wood and finished off with a museum grade non-reflective UV glass which creates the illusion of a real plant floating in the frame.</p>
<h3>What You Get </h3>
<p>As part of my rewards I’ll be making an epic assortment of limited edition signed, framed prints available at cost price from my exhibition as a special once off only, exclusive to the supporters of my campaign :) This will in turn help me get all my artworks up on the wall - which I’m hugely excited about. </p>
<p>My top rewards are next level AMAZING!!! I have curated <strong>4 </strong><strong>limited-release </strong><strong><i>CheckMyPlants</i></strong><strong> Smeg FAB28 retro fridges</strong> featuring my work. These incredibly special tribute pieces are literally <u>the only ones of their kind in the world</u>, and will be available in South Africa exclusively through this campaign only.

<h3>About the book </h3>
<p>It's been 4 years now since I've been constantly taking photos of my hometown, without being able to explain to myself why. I found out just recently, while working on this book. The answer is: I feel homesick. Obvious? Rather not... For me, the feeling of homesickness is not about the romantic image of a sunset at the hangout place, nor the smell of baked pies made by my grandmother.  My feeling of homesick lies beyond, floating somewhere around all those familiar places.</p>
<p>I've always felt the ghostly atmosphere of my town, but now, after years of being away and visiting only once in a while, I became aware of the impact that migration has had on small cities. I realize I've also contributed to it myself, the day I left my hometown. Therefore, this project became like an archive where I store the places that keep my memories, my identity.</p>
<p>There's a whole universe inside the photos, inside the book. It's the world of hometowns and that's why I believe that other people can relate to it as well. It is something that I can't explain through words and it should stay like that, like being homesick. You can't judge it; you can only embrace it. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504544939/wse1doevzdph4tzbpgev.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<li>20 images from the series were exhibited in 2016 in Munich, Germany @ Die Faerberei Gallery</li>
<li>a second exhibition of the photos will take place in Bucharest on The White Night of the Art Galleries starting October 6 @ AP. 1 gallery.</li>

<li>Jasmina Al-Qaisi - is a visual ethnographer currently working in Berlin's blooming art space, Savvy Contemporary. She will write a not-so-serious essay about the photos, migration and homesickness, which will be included in the book. The essay is written both in English and Romanian.</li>
<li>LOOT - is a the duo of Ana Grigoroiu and Ste Dobrescu. They work actively as graphic designers with a playful approach. They are the brains of JUG Magazine and their design doesn't stop here.

<h3>Technical Facts  </h3>
<p>Self-Published edition of 300 copies, 96 color pages, sewn binding, softcover with a photo on each side of the cover. The essay is written both in English and Romanian. The book will contain approx. 70 photos.</p>

<h3>The Impact </h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505222565/wgc5ys6pwsmwoiiv8xbr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Starting from the premise that small cities can shrink to the verge of total abandonment, <i>Hometown</i> appears right before an abrupt change, standing out as the ambassador of the places we call home.</p>
<p>Hometown will say no to ""update"" and tell us how it used to be, before things start to fundamentally change, or even disappear. </p>
<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>I have a tight <strong>deadline</strong> to finish the book, given by The Administration of the National Cultural Fund, which is the <strong>15th of November 2017</strong>. If I don't finance the book by the deadline, the fund will<strong> take the money back.</strong></p>
<p>Apart from losing the financing, the risks are minimal. I have a great creative &amp; professional team around me who are doing this kind of stuff for a living.</p>
</div>
<h3><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get </strong></h3>
<p><strong>This campaign will part-fund the following expenses:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>printing press (printing, binding, cover, finishing)</p></li>
<li>scanning the negatives and grading the photos</li>
<li>graphic design &amp; DTP</li>
</ul>
<p>All the film rolls, laboratory expenses, and travel costs have been already supported by the photographer, so the money raised here will not be used to refinance those expenses, <u>they will go straight into the making of the book.</u></p>
<p>If you will help me reach beyond 4500$, this will enable a new feature for the book: a hardcover.</p>
<h3><strong>In exchange for your support, you will receive some treats as well.</strong></h3>
<p><u>The giveaways are manufactured by Petre, my childhood friend. Check them out.</u></p>

<h3>// Despre carte</h3>
<p>De 4 ani fac poze în oraşul meu natal fără să pot să-mi explic motivul. Mi-am dat seama doar recent în timp ce lucram la carte. Răspunsul este dorul de casă. Evident? Nu chiar... pentru că eu nu asociez dorul de casă cu imaginea romantică a unui apus de soare în locul în care stăteam cu prietenii și nici cu mirosul de plăcinte făcute de bunică-mea. Dorul de casă e dincolo de toate astea, răspândit undeva în banalul locurilor.</p>
<p>Mereu am simţit că oraşul are o atmosferă fantomatică, însă acum, după ani de absență, am devenit conştient de impactul pe care l-a avut migrarea asupra oraşelor mici şi mi-am dat seama că şi eu am contribuit la asta atunci când am plecat. Așa că proiectul <i>Hometown </i>a devenit un fel de arhivă unde depozitez locurile care îmi stochează amintirile şi identitatea.</p>
<p>Simt că e o lume în toate aceste fotografii, în carte. E lumea oraşelor natale şi de aceea cred că şi alţi oameni pot empatiza cu aceste locuri. E ceva ce nu pot explica în cuvinte şi cred că ar trebui să rămână aşa, ca dorul de casă. Nu trebuie să fie judecat, ci doar acceptat.</p>
<p><strong>Materialitatea cărţii este decisivă. <i>Hometown</i> este o carte-obiect menită ca o experienţă, ce are scopul final de a te trimite cu mintea la tine acasă. Pentru a realiza asta, am făcut echipă cu:</strong></p>

About the book 
It's been 4 years now since I've been constantly taking photos of my hometown, without being able to explain to myself why. I found out just recently, while working on this book. The answer is: I feel homesick. Obvious? Rather not... For me, the feeling of homesickness is not about the romantic image of a sunset at the hangout place, nor the smell of baked pies made by my grandmother.  My feeling of homesick lies beyond, floating somewhere around all those familiar places.
I've always felt the ghostly atmosphere of my town, but now, after years of being away and visiting only once in a while, I became aware of the impact that migration has had on small cities. I realize I've also contributed to it myself, the day I left my hometown. Therefore, this project became like an archive where I store the places that keep my memories, my identity.
There's a whole universe inside the photos, inside the book. It's the world of hometowns and that's why I believe that other people can relate to it as well. It is something that I can't explain through words and it should stay like that, like being homesick. You can't judge it; you can only embrace it. 

The project has already received some recognition

60% of the book's budget is already financed by the Romanian Administration of the National Cultural Fund
20 images from the series were exhibited in 2016 in Munich, Germany @ Die Faerberei Gallery
a second exhibition of the photos will take place in Bucharest on The White Night of the Art Galleries starting October 6 @ AP. 1 gallery.
photos published on VICE in multiple articles, both national and international

Meet the team 


Dragos Hanciu - photographer and the co-editor of the book. He started as a documentary film director, but now he is putting up together 4 years of documenting his hometown  http://dragoshanciu.com/

Fiorenza Pinna - the editor and curator of the book, who will help me put everything together. Since 2009, she has been producing and curating exhibitions, books, and photobook workshops all over the world – working with renowned photographers like Rinko Kawauchi, Anouk Kruithof, Rob Hornstra, Joachim Schmid, among the others. 
Jasmina Al-Qaisi - is a visual ethnographer currently working in Berlin's blooming art space, Savvy Contemporary. She will write a not-so-serious essay about the photos, migration and homesickness, which will be included in the book. The essay is written both in English and Romanian.
LOOT - is a the duo of Ana Grigoroiu and Ste Dobrescu. They work actively as graphic designers with a playful approach. They are the brains of JUG Magazine and their design doesn't stop here. LOOT is making a various collection of clothing and accessories. https://weareloot.com/

Fabrik - a premium Romanian printing house, who has been winning several awards for the books they've bound in the past years, will do the magical manufacture of the object, the book. http://www.fabrik.ro/

Bianca Oana - project manager
Petre - wood artist - responsible with the colored stripes https://www.facebook.com/stripeskateboards/

Black Horse Mansion - videographers https://www.facebook.com/blackhorsemansion/



Technical Facts  
Self-Published edition of 300 copies, 96 color pages, sewn binding, softcover with a photo on each side of the cover. The essay is written both in English and Romanian. The book will contain approx. 70 photos.


The Impact 

Starting from the premise that small cities can shrink to the verge of total abandonment, Hometown appears right before an abrupt change, standing out as the ambassador of the places we call home.
Hometown will say no to ""update"" and tell us how it used to be, before things start to fundamentally change, or even disappear. 
Risks and challenges
I have a tight deadline to finish the book, given by The Administration of the National Cultural Fund, which is the 15th of November 2017. If I don't finance the book by the deadline, the fund will take the money back.
Apart from losing the financing, the risks are minimal. I have a great creative & professional team around me who are doing this kind of stuff for a living.

What I Need & What You Get 
This campaign will part-fund the following expenses:

printing press (printing, binding, cover, finishing)
scanning the negatives and grading the photos
graphic design & DTP

All the film rolls, laboratory expenses, and travel costs have been already supported by the photographer, so the money raised here will not be used to refinance those expenses, they will go straight into the making of the book.
If you will help me reach beyond 4500$, this will enable a new feature for the book: a hardcover.
In exchange for your support, you will receive some treats as well.
The giveaways are manufactured by Petre, my childhood friend. Check them out.
The magical reading ring // Degetarul de carte

The 10x15cm photo frame // Rama foto de birou 10x15cm

Bookmarks // Semne de carte

Pencil Holder // Suportul de creioane

Book Stand // Suportul de cărţi


your name will be written at the end of the book
a signed copy of the photo book Hometown - edition of 300 only.
10x15cm signed high quality prints of any picture you want from the project - you will be able to choose from never seen before pictures! 
20x30cm Museum Print. Get one of the 20 Fine Art Prints exhibited @ Die Faerberei gallery in Munich last year + a certificate of authenticity. Each photo is limited to 12 copies and some of them are long gone! You can send a message to ask for more details, or drop by AP. 1 gallery in Bucharest to see them http://ap1.space/

Together we battled through sleep deprivation, physical exhaustion, and mind games to earn the title of United States Marines. We were stationed at nearby bases on the West Coast and used our weekends to develop our photography work alongside each other. On the beaches of San Diego, in the mountains of Yosemite, and through the rocky canyons of the Anza Borrego Desert, we kept pushing the envelope with our photography, but more importantly, our hunger for thrill seeking.</p><p>           We culminated our years of experience as photographers, outdoorsmen, and military planners when we embarked on a seventeen-day winter photography project in the unforgiving and alien landscape of Iceland. We planned for logistical factors, camped in the snow, hiked icy trails, tracked atmospheric conditions, made critical decisions on the fly, and created some of the most incredible images of our careers.</p><p>            We’re producing this gallery show because we want to share our artwork and insights about the methods behind our madness with you. Among our prints on display will be audience favorites from years past, as well as previously unpublished images from Iceland making their world debut at the show. We'll also tell you all about the planning process that sets us apart from other photographers.</p><p>Our show is free to attend, but here on this page you can reserve your VIP pass, or get the drop on special print deals if you won’t be able to attend.

Edge"" – Aaron Moshier</p></div>","An Art Show Unlike Any Other           Our story starts nearly a decade ago in the hills of Quantico, Virginia. Together we battled through sleep deprivation, physical exhaustion, and mind games to earn the title of United States Marines. We were stationed at nearby bases on the West Coast and used our weekends to develop our photography work alongside each other. On the beaches of San Diego, in the mountains of Yosemite, and through the rocky canyons of the Anza Borrego Desert, we kept pushing the envelope with our photography, but more importantly, our hunger for thrill seeking.           We culminated our years of experience as photographers, outdoorsmen, and military planners when we embarked on a seventeen-day winter photography project in the unforgiving and alien landscape of Iceland. We planned for logistical factors, camped in the snow, hiked icy trails, tracked atmospheric conditions, made critical decisions on the fly, and created some of the most incredible images of our careers.            We’re producing this gallery show because we want to share our artwork and insights about the methods behind our madness with you. Among our prints on display will be audience favorites from years past, as well as previously unpublished images from Iceland making their world debut at the show. We'll also tell you all about the planning process that sets us apart from other photographers.Our show is free to attend, but here on this page you can reserve your VIP pass, or get the drop on special print deals if you won’t be able to attend. Attendees will be rewarded with complimentary wine, beer, and food.VIP PassesFor your $50 contribution, you get:

<h3><u>Who Are We?</u></h3>
<p>We at the Carolina Manga Library (501c3) are dedicated to the principle that children should be allowed and encouraged to read whatever they desire.  We strive to promote life-long love of reading in children, teens, and adults.  To achieve this goal, we operate a traveling graphic novel library that sets up at schools, public libraries, conventions, festivals, hospitals, and children's shelters to provide free access to thousands of graphic novels.</p>
<p>With the coming of COVID 19, all of our endeavors have been shut down.  We cannot safely travel to any location until it has been deemed safe to do so.  Over 90% of our annual funding comes from funds raised at these events.  No events means no funding.  No funding means that our storage units (where we keep the books between shows), and our vehicle gets repossessed.  Or we go out of business.  Whichever comes first.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><u>What We Need </u></h3>
<p>We are aiming to raise enough funding to keep the business open until it is safe to travel again.  We have to raise operating costs for the next 6 months.  While we don't have very many expenses and do not have any paid employees, we still have to provide for upkeep and rent of our vehicles and storage facilities.</p>
<p>To raise the funds, we have partnered with amazing cosplayers from several different countries to create a 2021 Cosplay Calendar!  Our calendar showcases 12 different fantastic cosplayers reading and enjoying books while in costume.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><u>What You Get</u></h3>
<p>We have 3 different Calendars to choose from.  Each calendar is a unique combination of cosplays from anime, manga, movies, TV shows, comics, and literature.  Each photo has the cosplayer and photographer's information clearly stated, so make sure you follow anyone you enjoy!</p>

<h3><u>Your Impact</u></h3>
<p>Every $1000 we raise keeps the Manga Library in business for another full month.  Your contributions go straight to the running of the business.  You are helping to pay for storage units, vehicle costs, and insurance.  No salaries are paid out of this or any other online funds raised by our organization.  We currently have the funds to make it until November 2020.  Once that date passes the Manga Library will not be able to sustain itself until and if convention appearances start up in 2021.     </p>
<p> </p>

<h3><u>Risks &amp; Challenges</u></h3>
<p>We've had several online fundraisers and we have learned something from each fundraiser.  This will be the first time we are creating a product specifically for a fundraiser.  This is slightly new territory for us, but our team is well versed in creating and shipping out perks in a timely manner.    </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><u>Timeline &amp; Shipping</u></h3>
<p>The fundraiser will run for 20 days.  Once the campaign concludes, a survey will go out to everyone asking which calendar(s) you wish to order.</p>
<p>We will give everyone a week to return the surveys, and then the calendars go into production.  We are told that the turnaround time for a bulk order is about three weeks, so we are aiming to receive the calendars by early October.  </p>
<p>Once we receive the calendars, we will perform a quality check on every calendar before it is shipped out to donors.  We are aiming to ship out calendars in late October.  </p>
<p><u>Shipping:</u>  <strong>SHIPPING COSTS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN YOUR PLEDGE.</strong>  When items are ready to be shipped, you will receive an invoice for your specific package, calculated per weight and location.  All perks will be shipped via USPS for US orders and other outlets for international shipping.  All donors will receive a tracking number for their perk package.  Please understand that once the package is shipped out we have <u>NO CONTROL</u> over how fast it gets to you.  Refunds/replacements will only be allowed if proof positive is provided <u>BY THE DONOR</u> that the package was lost in shipping.  </p>

</div><p> </p></div>","Who Are We?
We at the Carolina Manga Library (501c3) are dedicated to the principle that children should be allowed and encouraged to read whatever they desire.  We strive to promote life-long love of reading in children, teens, and adults.  To achieve this goal, we operate a traveling graphic novel library that sets up at schools, public libraries, conventions, festivals, hospitals, and children's shelters to provide free access to thousands of graphic novels.
With the coming of COVID 19, all of our endeavors have been shut down.  We cannot safely travel to any location until it has been deemed safe to do so.  Over 90% of our annual funding comes from funds raised at these events.  No events means no funding.  No funding means that our storage units (where we keep the books between shows), and our vehicle gets repossessed.  Or we go out of business.  Whichever comes first.  
 

What We Need 
We are aiming to raise enough funding to keep the business open until it is safe to travel again.  We have to raise operating costs for the next 6 months.  While we don't have very many expenses and do not have any paid employees, we still have to provide for upkeep and rent of our vehicles and storage facilities.
To raise the funds, we have partnered with amazing cosplayers from several different countries to create a 2021 Cosplay Calendar!  Our calendar showcases 12 different fantastic cosplayers reading and enjoying books while in costume.  
 
What You Get
We have 3 different Calendars to choose from.  Each calendar is a unique combination of cosplays from anime, manga, movies, TV shows, comics, and literature.  Each photo has the cosplayer and photographer's information clearly stated, so make sure you follow anyone you enjoy!



 
Additional Items:
Stickers
2 vinyl water resistant stickers of our adorable mascots

Bookmarks
Two beautiful bookmarks (holographic!) to keep between the pages of your favorite pages.

 
Sparkle Jars (Large)
These 20 jars have been donated by SparklePlentyPieces and are large calming jars.  Simply shake them up and watch the glitter and other surprises settle, creating a calming effect on anxious minds.  Great for kids and for work!  Jars are nearly unbreakable and sealed shut, preventing spillage.  NOT FOR CONSUMPTION OR APPLICATION TO SKIN.  These are purely decorative.

<p>I work for two years in the town of Barranquitas located in the Zulia state in Venezuela. This town has the highest concentration of people with Huntington's disease or Mal de San Vito disease in the world.</p>
<p>The disease of San Vito is a neurodegenative disease that has serious consequences for those who suffer it. Choreoids or constant involuntary movements, difficulty speaking, swallowing, loos concentration , depression, anxiety, irritability, sleep disturbances, being a neurodegenerative disease in some cases, the patient at the end of the stage of the disease suffers from dementia.</p>
<p>Is a mortal disease, that progresses slowly and gradual. The average duration is between  15 and 20 years. Most people develop the disease in adulthood between  35 and 55 years old but there are very rare cases in which develop before the age of 10. </p>
<p>Barranquitas is a fishing village on the shores of Lake Maracaibo, is a small town but with very high levels of poverty and misery.</p>
<p>My first approach to the people came from an assignment for The Guardian magazine about the disease.  I travel with Charlotte Raven  She had already been diagnosed with the disease.From that first encounter I was shocked by the crudeness of this reality, which also happened in my own country. So after a few years after investigating and collecting money to travel several times to Barranquitas, I undertook this project.</p>
<p>I traveled several times to the town and I was able to work with five of the many cases of the disease in the village. With them I established a very close relationship that allowed me to work with great ease as well as to understand much more about the disease and its crude reality in the town. The town is also a character in this work. Many of them live alone in tin houses without any comfort, and with the little help that they give them some neighbors of the community.</p>
<p>Those who suffer from the disease suffer the penury of poverty and do not have any type of health assistance to alleviate a little the hard fight of the disease.</p>
<p>After finishing this project, I have managed to get a great contribution to turn this project into a book, but I need a little more to achieve the goal. I'm interested in the stories of these characters being known as much as possible and that people in the world can realize this raw reality.</p>
<p> And that's where I need help to be able to do it. Your support is essential to achieve this goal. I will be deeply grateful for your contribution. What I need is to be able to finish covering design and printing.</p>

It is a work that combines street photography, music, dance, and religious ritual documentation. While in Nigeria, <b>Alex Riedlinger</b> spent considerable time shadowing young Yoruba Ifa priests that are heirs to an old and respected religious practice involving complex systems of divination, an expansive oral and musical tradition and the worship of ancestors and precolonial deities called Orisa. The young priests depicted in this series represent a synthesis of traditional Yoruba identity and contemporary values. Following these young men traversing city streets, acquiring materials for ritual, attending festivals, performing rituals, drumming, dancing, and partying as young men do, Alex was able to capture the ebb and flow of life in their distinct but integrative community. Shot over a month using a loose, diaristic shooting style and high contrast film, the images in tone reflect the fast paced and colorful identity of the Yoruba people in Nigeria.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial !important; border-width: initial; border-color: initial;""><b>See more of <i>Just Like That</i> <a href=""http://www.alexriedlinger.com/just-like-that-nigeria.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a> in hi-rez.</b></p><p></p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/701687/files/20140708014626-RiedlingerJustlikethat-2.jpg?1404809186"" src="""" style=""""/><p></p><p></p><p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/701700/files/20140708015301-RiedlingerJustlikethat-11.jpg?1404809581"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/701701/files/20140708015320-RiedlingerJustlikethat-10.jpg?1404809600"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><b>Why this work is important:</b></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">

Short Summary This is a once-off pre-publication offer to purchase Reflection at a considerable discount of up to 45%. 
I am a professional wildlife photographer from South Africa and have published more than 20 books to date. I have spent the last four years taking photographs for, including writing and planning, a book that is in a different class, and on a different scale from anything I have done before, and I am now at last ready to reveal it. The book is titled Reflection.
Main Features






1. We used no less than EIGHT inks of different colours to print this book. 







2. The book is HUGE – 380mm x 310mm x 28mm. 





3. This is not just a book of wildlife. It is a book of thoughts, reflection and candid philosophy.

4. I used only the best paper available (thick 200gsm matt art paper) and ground-breaking special textured UV varnish for the French-folded dust jacket.


For me Reflection is a book I simply had to make, regardless of the production cost.

Just a little more to go :) Thank you so much to everyone who has shown support to me! ~DanicaHello! My name is Danica Sherry, and I am a hobbyist photographer living in the village of Hillsborough, New Brunswick, Canada. I am a stay-at-home mom who primarily takes pictures of her own children and occasionally, their playmates. I am a beginner photographer who works with natural light and a trusty ten year old Canon rebel xt.""Boy with Apple""Through the push of a friend, I nervously began sharing my photography through social media almost a year ago and have since met wonderful artists who have provided me with advice, encouragement, and inspiration. I have continued to reach out and share within the international photographic community, and have been published in Vogue Italia, Photovogue, as well as The Imaginarium, Inspire Fine Art Magazine, Through a Mother's Eyes, and others. I have been so very grateful for their support!! ""Liberation""I recently submitted my work to Photo Moncton International, an atlantic Canadian photography conference, in hopes of participating in their photo exhibit. To my surprise and excitement, I found out that I was accepted! I only became aware of the request for artist's submissions at the end of the application deadline, so I have not had the opportunity to set aside funds to help with the framing and printing costs associated with a gallery exhibit. I have been quoted a cost of $500 for the framing/printing of nine images that have been selected, which is a very reasonable cost. It's just a lot for a stay-at-home mom to unexpectedly cover at once! I have also added on another $100 to cover the cost of indigogo fees, and potential shipping/production costs for donors wishing to take advantage of the 'perks'. This is a very short running indigogo campaign, as I have just 19 days to collect the funds. I would love to have the opportunity to participate in this exhibit, and I would be so very grateful for any support that could help make this happen!Thank you!!~DanicaFeel free to check out my photography page on Facebook :)""The Last of Summer's Blooms""

With clear-eyed reporting and her starkly moving images of Mayan life along the shores of Lake Atitlan, Guatemala, and the healers who live and work there, Fran Antmann has shed light on a story known to few outside the Mayan world. Without forcing any conclusions, Antmann presents a powerful mystery—of the astonishing work performed by these curanderas, and the possibility that there are ways, beyond those of established western medicine, for healing to occur. And while the camera has not been built that can capture the mystery of how a healer's hands can cure the body, these photographs go a long way to making me believe that something extraordinary is taking place in those dark little rooms, where the healers practice their magic.” </blockquote><p>                                — Joyce Maynard, author</p><p><br/></p><p>– Video: Emma Kazaryan<br/>– Original Music: Eric Grunin<br/>– Voiceover: Bill Ratner</p><p><br/></p><p>REWARDS: Photos to choose from:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463772195/Reward_photos_pyoz9r.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div><br/></div><p>""Maya Healers: A Thousand Dreams"" has been featured in:</p><p><i>SocialDocumentary.net</i></p><p><i style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Edge of Humanity.org</i></p><p><i style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Viewfind.org</i></p><p><i>Voices of NY.org</i></p><br/>""Maya Healers: A Thousand Dreams"" has been selected for fiscal sponsorship from the New York Foundation for the Arts. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">NYFA)/Artspire, is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, through which all contributions are tax-deductible.</span>

We remember and your mother is part of that remembering.”
With your help, I hope I will have fulfilled that promise.
Your support will enable me to pay the supplemental printing costs to have this book published. With your help I will be able to produce a beautiful and evocative photography book that helps preserve the Maya culture. The courage of these people against all odds deserves to be told. 
Please, spread the word.

“Fran Antmann's work in Maya Healers, years in the making, is imbued with the depth and texture only great photography can achieve; where the images transcend being mere documents but reach great art. Many of the images, especially of the people in their daily lives, are transcendent and absolutely gorgeous, revealing an empathy and visual perception that is timeless.”  
— Ed Kashi, award-winning international photojournalist“Not since Anne Fadiman’s The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down have I read a work that so powerfully conveys the idea that there is no way to separate the concept of healing from the culture out of which it arises. With clear-eyed reporting and her starkly moving images of Mayan life along the shores of Lake Atitlan, Guatemala, and the healers who live and work there, Fran Antmann has shed light on a story known to few outside the Mayan world. Without forcing any conclusions, Antmann presents a powerful mystery—of the astonishing work performed by these curanderas, and the possibility that there are ways, beyond those of established western medicine, for healing to occur. And while the camera has not been built that can capture the mystery of how a healer's hands can cure the body, these photographs go a long way to making me believe that something extraordinary is taking place in those dark little rooms, where the healers practice their magic.”                                 — Joyce Maynard, author– Video: Emma Kazaryan– Original Music: Eric Grunin– Voiceover: Bill RatnerREWARDS: Photos to choose from:""Maya Healers: A Thousand Dreams"" has been featured in:SocialDocumentary.netEdge of Humanity.orgViewfind.orgVoices of NY.org""Maya Healers: A Thousand Dreams"" has been selected for fiscal sponsorship from the New York Foundation for the Arts. NYFA)/Artspire, is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, through which all contributions are tax-deductible.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Pictures from an organic chemistry laboratory photo website project</h3>
<p>This project would be about to get a few dollars for a new Nikon DSLR camera, since my currently used D5000 is going to die soon and I have no funds to repair it or to get another one.</p>
<p>Also it is planned to get a domain name for my pictures and move them to a proper website from the currently used Tumblr blog, because I think that everyone should know and should see that how awesome chemistry, especially organic and inorganic chemistry is.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Actually I am working in an organic chemistry laboratory where I take photographs from my work, from what happens in an organic lab like that. I share these pictures on my blog (<a href=""labphoto.tumblr.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""labphoto.tumblr.com"">labphoto.tumblr.com</a>), but this blog has borders and it would be much better to share it an an own (proper) website.</p>
<p>The other, the more expensive part of the campaign is about my camera what I use for years now and has nearly 100k expo in it. It is still working but it shows several signs about it's end, so it would be great to change it to a Nikon D7000 or just get as little money that would be good to repair it if any proble would happen.</p>

<p>Because actually only a small section of the people is interested in real preparative organic chemistry what is a beautiful ""art"" and also really important for the future (medicines, paints, and almost everything what you can see is chemistry).

<p>Hello! I´m Julio Mosso and I studied photography at Cambridge School of Art in England thanks to my italian Passport, my Jobs in restaurants and my passion for travelling and meeting new cultures, I lived 6 years in England where I learnt how to speak English until I was accepted at University. I always had great interest for art and to define myself and my hallmark within it or the branches that spread out from it or come to join it(as in a crossover photography, ethnography and illustration). I´ve been 5 years doing a large Project that encompasses several cities of the world and i try to make something unique in a memory created by the people.</p>
<p>                                         </p>
<p>                                             THE MIDDLEMAN (foundation)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>During my time in England I was missing my family in Chile and my city. After years  of not seeing any of them, their pictures became a precios object with the power to get me closer to them. In that moment was born my passion for this Project where I could capture a memory capable of transporting us like a time machine. </p>
<p>With my Project I wanted to share part of the essence of the place. Bearing in mind that I was not the only person in the global world where the imigration is a social reality, I thought I could gather different cultures and make a novel glance at them. together with this idea my Project allows the interaction between cultures and to approach citizens to a intercultural perspective where links are created trough the characters, celebrating diversity.</p>
<p>In the beggining my Project only consisted of a photographic memory but knowing the limitations I decided to broaden the media of the Project with the voices of the people also generating an ethnographic investigation. Anthony Giddens states,""ethnography is the direct study of people or groups during a certain period of time, using active observation or the interviews to know about their social behaviour, registering a clear image and faithfull of the group under study; work in the field becomes an indispensable tool.""</p><p>The limitation that photography has is to show only one moment of reality but in this etnographic investigation and thanks to the interviews that involve, we get to know the reality of the people and the characters. This approachment happens from the very inquietudes of the people who live everyday in the city and the daily events that happen in it. The interviews take place through a socialisation process and interaction with the citizens and will be produced by the same inhabitants.<br/></p><p>Within all this process the etnographic investigator and artist (me) has the rol of mediating (middleman) that participates in the proyect without bias in the making of the questions (except for the 4 fixed questions) nor the recording of the answers, acting in a neutral way and giving the chance to people to record contemporary history with liberty.<br/></p><p>General Aim</p><p>Develop a photographic Project together with an Ethnographic and Illustration study, where a project that impacts culture at a global level and unites people of the world, is generated through a democratic development. </p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Specific objectives: </span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> 1 - Capture contemporary history and the intangible heritage, from different parts of the world through its characteristic characters; thus allowing us to bringing modern art to everyday experiences and relating it to the social sciences (Ethnography). </span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> 2 - Develop interculturality through a composed research procedure. </span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> 3 - Create a democratic participation process in art through citizens, with the generation of questions for the interview and character choosing. </span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> 4 - Create a project and a book that uses Photography, Ethnography and Illustration, rescuing art and culture of every continent. </span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> 5 - To involve the public in an interactive way under the main influence of photography and sound for sighted and non-sighted people at the photographic samples that include sound; and also through the CD that comes with the book for non-sighted people. </span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> 6 - Create a valuable memory for everyone, which will have the capacity to move us and transport us through space and time.</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">With your help I hope to be able to get another volume out, to advance, getting myself closer to the final product which is a book that comprises 6 volumes (one for each continent) and furthermore to exhibit in various museums  worldwide.<br/></span></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p>As a special reward I offer 3 portraits as if you were a character and I was photographing you in a path or road in the city of the third continent(does not include interview neither becomes part of the book).

</p><p><i><b>Photographer John Stember, a London native, lived and worked in New York during
the tumultuous period of the 70’s-80’s Pop Culture and barely survived with his life. His
photographic ode to GIA is his personal reconciliation with the dark side of that fashion
era in New York and his cherished memories of G I A</b></i></p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Hello. My name is John Stember. I'm a photographer known principally for my fashion
and images d'art. I started my first studio at age 19 over 50 years ago in London. Going
though my archives I found these photographs that I had taken of GIA from 1979 to
1982 over 30 years ago. I hadn’t seen them in years but I instantly recalled our many
colorful and dramatic experiences together. She was an amazing beauty a wild rebel
and definitely a one of a kind who changed the fashion world forever.
</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Meteoric is the only word to describe GIA Carangi’s rise to supermodel status in the
years from 1979 to 1982. She arrived on the Manhattan fashion scene as a seventeen
year old with a major wild streak and an exceptionally seductive beauty, and was
immediately signed by the top model agency Wilhelmina.
</p>
<p>We first met when we worked together for Vogue magazine in New York in 1979. At
that time she had only recently arrived in New York but even then she had a dynamic
character unlike any other model. She never posed like most models, she was
continually moving as if in another world. She was always doing her own ‘thing’.
</p>
<p>She had the perfect face, body and looks for a model plus she moved naturally like a
wild animal and had the provocative ‘I don’t give a damn’ attitude to go with it.
</p>
<p>Working with GIA could easily become chaotic and although she could be
tempestuous and difficult, she could sometimes be as sweet as a kitten. Regardless
she always came to life in front of the camera, in a way that was both spontaneous
and unsurpassed. Which is why I loved working her. She was the best model I have
ever worked with ... a 'natural born supermodel'.
</p>
<p>Her favorite revenge when angered, with an editor or member of the crew, was to bide
her time sometimes for hours, until finally she'd make her move. She'd sabotage the
entire shoot just seconds before the first click of the camera causing many hours of
hair, make-up and styling to be be wasted without a single photograph being taken.
She’d often create a diversion by feigning a pain in the stomach, then either jump into
a swimming pool fully dressed and made up or just disappear out of a window, leaving
everyone staring at the sky in disbelief.
</p>
<p>No matter how outrageous her behavior, the fashion magazines would continually re-
book for more. They would tolerate her craziness because they wanted the
commercial success she brought them, but they intensely disliked what she put them
through to get the photographs they needed. She was the ultimate provocateur.
</p>
<p>Her career was dramatically cut short in 1986, at the young age of 26 when she
became one of the first celebrities to die from AIDS in the USA. It was a result of her
growing addiction to heroin and her need to overcome her obsessive sense of
abandonment. She suffered from an insurmountable feeling of ‘lovelessness'.
</p>
<p>GIA had fallen headfirst into the dark side of fame. The demons she faced could have
been anyone’s, including my own. The obsessive need to be loved and the curse of
temptation were never far away.
</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>Thirty years later, it’s become obvious if not imperative for me to share what I had
experienced and what she left behind, captured in these photographs. You witness
the dichotomy of the light and beauty in these photographs that was so dramatically
and diametrically opposed to the reality of the darkness and loneliness in her personal
life.

Somehow I came across Gia a few years ago ... I heard of her and the Angelina documentary and wondered who is this Gia? I had heard of the other major supermodels ...Naomi, Cindy, Christy, etc. So, I looked her up ... I think she is the best model that has ever existed and I will for sure be a backer of your project. There is a lot I can't relate to when it comes to her, but there is something that gravitates one to be in complete awe of her. She has depth to her pictures and she is the type that can be a chameleon. Thank you for doing this your photographs are exquisite! Kim photo © alexis stemberJOHN STEMBER




Photographer John Stember, a London native, lived and worked in New York during
the tumultuous period of the 70’s-80’s Pop Culture and barely survived with his life. His
photographic ode to GIA is his personal reconciliation with the dark side of that fashion
era in New York and his cherished memories of G I A
1
Hello. My name is John Stember. I'm a photographer known principally for my fashion
and images d'art. I started my first studio at age 19 over 50 years ago in London. Going
though my archives I found these photographs that I had taken of GIA from 1979 to
1982 over 30 years ago. I hadn’t seen them in years but I instantly recalled our many
colorful and dramatic experiences together. She was an amazing beauty a wild rebel
and definitely a one of a kind who changed the fashion world forever.




Meteoric is the only word to describe GIA Carangi’s rise to supermodel status in the
years from 1979 to 1982. She arrived on the Manhattan fashion scene as a seventeen
year old with a major wild streak and an exceptionally seductive beauty, and was
immediately signed by the top model agency Wilhelmina.

We first met when we worked together for Vogue magazine in New York in 1979. At
that time she had only recently arrived in New York but even then she had a dynamic
character unlike any other model. She never posed like most models, she was
continually moving as if in another world. She was always doing her own ‘thing’.

She had the perfect face, body and looks for a model plus she moved naturally like a
wild animal and had the provocative ‘I don’t give a damn’ attitude to go with it.

Working with GIA could easily become chaotic and although she could be
tempestuous and difficult, she could sometimes be as sweet as a kitten. Regardless
she always came to life in front of the camera, in a way that was both spontaneous
and unsurpassed. Which is why I loved working her. She was the best model I have
ever worked with ... a 'natural born supermodel'.

Her favorite revenge when angered, with an editor or member of the crew, was to bide
her time sometimes for hours, until finally she'd make her move. She'd sabotage the
entire shoot just seconds before the first click of the camera causing many hours of
hair, make-up and styling to be be wasted without a single photograph being taken.
She’d often create a diversion by feigning a pain in the stomach, then either jump into
a swimming pool fully dressed and made up or just disappear out of a window, leaving
everyone staring at the sky in disbelief.

No matter how outrageous her behavior, the fashion magazines would continually re-
book for more. They would tolerate her craziness because they wanted the
commercial success she brought them, but they intensely disliked what she put them
through to get the photographs they needed. She was the ultimate provocateur.

Her career was dramatically cut short in 1986, at the young age of 26 when she
became one of the first celebrities to die from AIDS in the USA. It was a result of her
growing addiction to heroin and her need to overcome her obsessive sense of
abandonment. She suffered from an insurmountable feeling of ‘lovelessness'.

GIA had fallen headfirst into the dark side of fame. The demons she faced could have
been anyone’s, including my own. The obsessive need to be loved and the curse of
temptation were never far away.

2

Thirty years later, it’s become obvious if not imperative for me to share what I had
experienced and what she left behind, captured in these photographs. You witness
the dichotomy of the light and beauty in these photographs that was so dramatically
and diametrically opposed to the reality of the darkness and loneliness in her personal
life.

She left us a heart wrenching message in her ABC 20/20 Television interview when she said ‘when you're young it's hard to make out the difference as to what is real and what is unreal’ in this world.The G I A exhibition is created in her honor, as a tribute to her great beauty, rebellious spirit and for the thousands of fans to whom she has become an inspiration. Please join me in bringing this exciting project into the world.

This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to acquire collectors archival pigment prints of images which appear in the 'GIA' Exhibition and the exclusive BOOK of photographs at a much reduced price than normal.

THE GOAL
The goal of the GIA INDIEGOGO Campaign is to raise $12,000 or more in order to fund this GIA exhibition. PERKS are offered in return for pledges. These rewards offer supporters of the campaign an opportunity to acquire the stunning, personally signed collector’s archival pigment prints of GIA offered at greatly reduced prices exclusively through this GIA INDIEGOGO campaign.

Premium contributors will be invited to attend the GIA Exhibition Premiere on September 3rd, 2014 at the Cipriani Club 55 on Wall Street. The night of the premiere, supermodels of the 80’s that are present will also be celebrated. Guests will be able to mingle with them as well as Guest of Honor, Miss Sandy Linter.
With your generous backing, you will be participating in the creation of the first photographic exhibition dedicated exclusively to the life and spirit of the iconic supermodel GIA Carangi.
I sincerely thank you both for your interest and your generosity.

Many of Noah's songs mention Cadillacs, or classic cars, and we felt that the otherwise mundane day-to-day of a DIY touring rockstar would be made ever more interesting by staging the filming of a west-coast tour of the United States from behind the facade of a worn, vintage Cadillac. We were right in our attempt, but we blew up the engine less than two hours into our month-long journey from Phoenix, to San Diego, all the way north to Seattle, and back through Reno and Las Vegas to central Arizona. None of it was staged, and we unintentionally charred a lot of bridges in the process, but it made for a good portion of film. We eventually received recognition on ""My Caddy Won't Let Me"" with inclusion to numerous film festivals, including the prestigious ""Short Documentary Film"" program at the 2012 Phoenix Film Festival, where I was also honored to be invited as a featured panelist on their ""Independent Film Roundtable"". By pledging your money and good name to this hubcap, book, and poster package–it's true!–you are dedicating your support to the art far more than any profit of the artist. Plus, it's a vintage automobile hubcap! An enjoyable, simple appreciation of classic American automotive design and history with an interesting back-story. Also, these original hubcaps fetch some decent cash on the open market. Just sayin'! Who knows, maybe your indie-rockumentary film hubcap will someday send your eldest to stenographer school!</p><p><br/><b>Who exactly am I, and how do you know I'm legit?</b></p><p>Uhhhh, duh!

Only <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/urbanic"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">legit players</a> skunk around on ""the net"", y'know. In fact, for the past decade I have been a professional video producer. While the majority of my work has typically been commercial promotional projects, I have had the unusual opportunity to explore and fulfill a vast number of ""cool projects"": documentary films; touring with, and photographing rock bands throughout the United States and Europe; lots of album art and graphic design (from which there may be another book, and/or gallery showing, stay tuned); and tons of music videos. There have been lots of musicians, and lots of photos over the years, but this volume culled from my work with Noah is unique both in it's depth, but also it's focus. When shooting photos of independent musicians you always end up with lots of very ""typical"" shots of bands <i>performing</i> in very uninteresting places. It is far more difficult to get a legitimately good opportunity to take even a marginally decent portrait of an independent musician, or band (for a lot of reasons I won't go into at this time) let alone the chance to create a <i>volume of work</i> showcasing one particular subject over both land and time that would be worth even a personal retrospective on your laptop, cold, and alone in your basement. In the case of my relationship with Noah, while I've been to a lot of his shows, I have very few photos of him performing live. This is because I was usually covering those performances for documentary film coverage, shooting video instead of stills. Instead, because we covered so much <i>actual geographic </i>ground creating the film footage–driving through, and killing down-time in the lost corners of America's west, between Houston and San Diego, all the way up to Seattle and back down to Phoenix–the photos I did get were almost all <i>portraits</i> nestled in the impromptu cruck of hot, welcoming desolation. Often, the goal of a photoshoot itself was known, but the destination was not: ""I know of a dirt road in these mountains, let's just drive up there for some photos on our way to Los Angeles."" The result is what you will find here in this gorgeous book that you will cherish until the day your soul and body divorce, and you merge with the infinite.</p><p><br/><b>Okay, seems legit. When do you get your book?</b></p><p>As soon as humanly possible. Upon the closing of the IndieGoGo campaign, I will make any final adjustments to the book layout for print (which is already essentially ready for print) and send the files and payment to the printer. Simple as that. Upon receiving the completed books from the printer, we will schedule a session for Noah and I to do the book signings (and numbering) in a convenient location–he lives in LA, I live in Phoenix, which probably means we'll sign your books in the bosom of the ghost of the desert outside of Joshua Tree. We'll jam pack the boxes and dump them off with the parcel carrier immediately thereafter. The assumption is that all of this can be buttoned up within approximately one month of sending the book to the printer.<br/><br/></p><p><b>How many books will be included in the limited first print?</b></p><p>You tell me. The pre-order limit in this campaign is capped at 68 total books. We will likely push the initial order a little beyond what we need to satisfy the orders from this campaign so we have a few extras to show as examples. Bare minimum: probably 10. Maximum: up to 75. Still an elite club, no matter how you cut it. Make yourself a part of the 1% (of indie-music art aficionados!)<br/><br/><br/><b>What are any challenges or roadblocks concerning the completion of this project?</b></p><p>Actually, there are no real roadblocks. However, printing niche art books in small volumes is expensive. The fulfillment of this campaign will allow me to tailor the first-edition print order to satisfy the immediate demand without exhausting my own bank account. Any challenge associated with this book might be, simply, the promise of delivering the final product on a certain day. My estimate is that the book could be delivered sometime in December 2015. Between print and delivery to me, then scheduling a time for hand-signing and numbering the books, and finally sending them out for delivery, there could be a variable of up to a few weeks. Can we get it to you by the end of December? Yes, possibly. Could it potentially be sometime in January if a few speed-bumps pop up? Sure. I will keep all backers updated through the entire process. Frankly, I would like to do a live-stream (Periscope, UStream, etc.) of the book signing and packaging for maximum engagement, if possible!

<p>When someone asks you to teach them English, you don't hand them a dictionary and tell them to learn all the words first, so why should learning photography be any different? At Primary Photo Education we feel that learning photography shouldn't involve months of classroom lecture and theory, but instead be a hands on and interactive experience between you, your gear and some of the best instructors in the business. We currently offer customizable one-on-one photo classes where our customers pick the time, subject, and even the location of their convenience, but we want to do more!  </p>
<p>We would like to offer group workshops that cover specific types of photography, but without sacrificing our hands-on approach.  These workshops would take the form of shooting a soccer game right from the sidelines or learning to capture star trails next to a calm lake.  We may even go so far as to stage an entire wedding just so our students get the experience we feel they deserve!  In these workshops, the student will receive invaluable tips, and hands-on experience from some of the best photographers in the business, but that's not the end of it.  We also plan to provide industry standard and professionally proffered equipment such as lenses and lighting to help our students make the right choices in their gear.</p>
<p>So what do we need your help for? Most of the donations will go toward ""class materials"" like the lenses and lighting we mentioned. These may be rentals or purchases, whatever ends up being more equitable. Significant amounts will also go toward renting classroom space when we need it. We will also be purchasing computers and a high-end projector and screen.  Whatever funds are left will go into our website and some hot advertising.</p>
<p>Like we said before, we've been doing this for a while and have already jumped most of the hurdles that new ventures run into.  With over 10 years of combined experience in teaching photography, we don't see providing well thought out and informative workshops as being a problem. There are, however, a few variables that haven't been present before. For example, what if we offer a class in a remote location and there are no classroom spaces for rent near by?

</div></div>","When someone asks you to teach them English, you don't hand them a dictionary and tell them to learn all the words first, so why should learning photography be any different? At Primary Photo Education we feel that learning photography shouldn't involve months of classroom lecture and theory, but instead be a hands on and interactive experience between you, your gear and some of the best instructors in the business. We currently offer customizable one-on-one photo classes where our customers pick the time, subject, and even the location of their convenience, but we want to do more!  
We would like to offer group workshops that cover specific types of photography, but without sacrificing our hands-on approach.  These workshops would take the form of shooting a soccer game right from the sidelines or learning to capture star trails next to a calm lake.  We may even go so far as to stage an entire wedding just so our students get the experience we feel they deserve!  In these workshops, the student will receive invaluable tips, and hands-on experience from some of the best photographers in the business, but that's not the end of it.  We also plan to provide industry standard and professionally proffered equipment such as lenses and lighting to help our students make the right choices in their gear.
So what do we need your help for? Most of the donations will go toward ""class materials"" like the lenses and lighting we mentioned. These may be rentals or purchases, whatever ends up being more equitable. Significant amounts will also go toward renting classroom space when we need it. We will also be purchasing computers and a high-end projector and screen.  Whatever funds are left will go into our website and some hot advertising.
Like we said before, we've been doing this for a while and have already jumped most of the hurdles that new ventures run into.  With over 10 years of combined experience in teaching photography, we don't see providing well thought out and informative workshops as being a problem. There are, however, a few variables that haven't been present before. For example, what if we offer a class in a remote location and there are no classroom spaces for rent near by? What if we can't find any teams willing to work with us on our action/sports seminars? Or worse, what if we can't get enough butts in seats to cover our expenses?We've been thinking about these issues for a while and have come up with a few creative solutions that we think may prevent them from cropping up.  Like purchasing folding chairs and a large outdoor canopy to hold the introduction and presentation portions of our workshops when we find ourselves in a remote location.

<p>My name is Katlyn and I am currently a freelance photographer in a small town near Youngstown, Ohio. Around the age of twelve I decided I wanted to be a photographer and three years later, I purchased the Canon T4I. My goal is to get more involved with the community and take part in local charities and capture what's going on in our town. As of now, I am a sophomore in high school and already have what I want to do in life figured out. Lately, I have come to the realization that I cannot carry on just with what came in the box last summer. Photography is a broad subject and it is a subject I plan to explore the next two years and into college with it. By helping me raise this money, it will help support the goals I want to take part in with the community, help those also interested in photography getting hands on with working with people on the job, booking, editing and printing. I'm very set on working towards this goal and also helping others around, knowing that I'm young and know what I want. I'd be really happy to help others and assure them that their goals and dreams are not impossible no matter how young they are. We are the future. <br/><br/>Alone, your support means the world to me. Though, in return to the contributors, I will write a letter to everyone who contributes. Those who donate $25+ will receive a letter and a hand made candy striped bracelet. Those who contribute $75+ will receive the letter, bracelet and a $25 Starbucks giftcard! If the goal isn't reached, the money will still be put into a separate bank account specifically for photography equipment and supplies.<br/><br/>The reason I am doing this is because I want to express my view of the world to a wider and eye opening angle. I enjoy creating things more than anything and putting a story or emotion into a photo is what I strongly enjoy because it's challenging.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><b>The trip is planned for May 2014</b>, I still have some preparations to do before we can go. It is not my intention to fund the entire trip with Indiegogo, I already did that with my own money. I do want to sell the book to people all around the world.<br/>A good friend of mine is going to design a professional book, to showcase a selection
 of the best photographs from the tour. I'll sell all the perks for costing price
 + international shipping. I'd love to see it going around the world. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I'm not doing this project to make a big profit off the books or anything, it's not gonna earn me any money. Instead, it's going
 to earn me fullfillment and joy, doing what I love most; photography. I do need some funds in advance to get it printed, because I just can´t front all the money myself, buying 150 books, not knowing who will buy or not buy the book.</p>
<p>My goal isn´t that much; it's only 500 euro's. If only one person buys a book, it will already be a succes.<br/>I'll also be adding some more perks along the way; from launch you can choose between a softcover of hardcover book or a poster of a photo later to choose. <br/></p>
<p>I am thinking about adding a Fine Art Baryte print to it later on, I just have to check on prices and possibilites!<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact<br/>
</h3>
<p>Two dutch newspapers already covered the project, and I couldn't be more excited. My eyes keep tearing up thinking about how cool my dad would think this is. I already got so much good reactions from not only friends and family, but also strangers that recognized me from the paper, just wanting to wish me good luck.<br/><br/>My dedication will be 100% from start to finish. I learned Russian to interact with the people there and to read the signs etc. To get a little further in-depth. I already put in around €1.500 of my own money and that's not the end of it. I can't wait to go.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>

But if you do want to help, help spread the website to as many people as you can! <a href=""http://www.project-tsjernobyl.nl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.project-tsjernobyl.nl</a><br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Going to Chernobyl to do some photography.

 to earn me fullfillment and joy, doing what I love most; photography. I do need some funds in advance to get it printed, because I just can´t front all the money myself, buying 150 books, not knowing who will buy or not buy the book.
My goal isn´t that much; it's only 500 euro's. If only one person buys a book, it will already be a succes.I'll also be adding some more perks along the way; from launch you can choose between a softcover of hardcover book or a poster of a photo later to choose. 
I am thinking about adding a Fine Art Baryte print to it later on, I just have to check on prices and possibilites!


The Impact

Two dutch newspapers already covered the project, and I couldn't be more excited. My eyes keep tearing up thinking about how cool my dad would think this is. I already got so much good reactions from not only friends and family, but also strangers that recognized me from the paper, just wanting to wish me good luck.My dedication will be 100% from start to finish. I learned Russian to interact with the people there and to read the signs etc. To get a little further in-depth. I already put in around €1.500 of my own money and that's not the end of it. I can't wait to go.

Mr. T.M. Lee started Holga as a company manufacturing quality external flash. As external flash was made increasingly obsolete by cameras with integrated flash, Holga came up with the idea to build an affordable camera for the emerging Chinese Mainland market, where 120mm film was then still the norm. In 1982, the legendary Holga 120 was born. To Mr Lee’s amazement, the camera was met with more interest worldwide, as people appreciated its simple yet reliable construction and ease of use.</p><p>Yet, Holga did not stop at the 120. Starting from the basic 120, Holga worked around and made multiple upgrades to the 120, remarkably the popular 120N with a hotshoe and the 120CFN with a built-in flash and color filters.</p><p>Moving towards the mid-80s, Lee made another camera for 135 films and logically named it Holga 135. The 135 platform proved to be extremely reliable and versatile. It has been modified into 135 panoramic, 135 TLR and even the famous 135TIM, of which the buttons are arranged in a smiley face and takes half-frame photos on a single film.</p><p>Additionally, Holga has made dozens of other cameras ranging from the Micro 110 to the 120-3D Stereo Camera, all preserving the unique distortion, lens flares and vignettes of the original Holga.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542684953/m0gocaczuxzr1ekbfc6n.png"" src=""""/></p><p>In the past few decades, Holga camera was being used for its surrealistic, impressionistic scenes for landscape, still life, portrait, and more notably street photography. A Holga photograph, which was taken by photojournalist David Burnett of former vice-president Al Gore, during a 2000 campaign appearance earned the top prize in a 2001 White House News Photographers' Association Eyes of History award ceremony.

Updated for the digital age yet retaining the simplicity and fun of the Holga camera, Holga Digital has became a hit and was loved by photographers from first-timers to professionals. Without requiring precise settings, Holga adds inspiration and creativity with its subtle randomness on every shot.Before back when digital photography has not become the common pastime as it is now, the solid photographs are considered to be ceremonious and are often used on commemorative occasions. With the increasing ease of taking photos, done simply with a smartphone, we feel like the essence of this once memorable experience has been gradually slipping away. Perhaps to really capture that beautiful moment, a digital photograph is simply not enough.  Holga has been producing cameras for 30-odd years. Mr. T.M. Lee started Holga as a company manufacturing quality external flash. As external flash was made increasingly obsolete by cameras with integrated flash, Holga came up with the idea to build an affordable camera for the emerging Chinese Mainland market, where 120mm film was then still the norm. In 1982, the legendary Holga 120 was born. To Mr Lee’s amazement, the camera was met with more interest worldwide, as people appreciated its simple yet reliable construction and ease of use.Yet, Holga did not stop at the 120. Starting from the basic 120, Holga worked around and made multiple upgrades to the 120, remarkably the popular 120N with a hotshoe and the 120CFN with a built-in flash and color filters.Moving towards the mid-80s, Lee made another camera for 135 films and logically named it Holga 135. The 135 platform proved to be extremely reliable and versatile. It has been modified into 135 panoramic, 135 TLR and even the famous 135TIM, of which the buttons are arranged in a smiley face and takes half-frame photos on a single film.Additionally, Holga has made dozens of other cameras ranging from the Micro 110 to the 120-3D Stereo Camera, all preserving the unique distortion, lens flares and vignettes of the original Holga.In the past few decades, Holga camera was being used for its surrealistic, impressionistic scenes for landscape, still life, portrait, and more notably street photography. A Holga photograph, which was taken by photojournalist David Burnett of former vice-president Al Gore, during a 2000 campaign appearance earned the top prize in a 2001 White House News Photographers' Association Eyes of History award ceremony. Famous photojournalist Teru Kuwayama was rarely seen without his Holga, as it is the most versatile and reliable camera in the wilds of Iraq and Afghanistan.Instant camera has been bulky, uncontrollable and uninspiring. This is changed with Holga Printer.Holga is always open to new ideas. In the 2010s, the function of camera is gradually overtaken by smartphones. While adding some smart functions into the camera to compete with the phone seems to be the trend, we would rather strive to incorporate the phone itself.With the same philosophy, we proudly present you the Holga Printer. We designed the printer as the Holga 120 of 2018. All the while utilizing the most common electronic device today – smartphone. Together with our exclusive app, users can now produce Holga-styled photos and have them developed on the Holga printer through the use of Fuji Instax mini film. The whole printing process is completely manual so batteries are not required at all.Another Holga product coming out with the printer will be its mobile counterpart, the HolgaCam app. Coupled with the Holga Printer, you will be able to start working on that scrapbook of precious memories. See the Holga Printer in action!Instant photography has made a strong comeback recently.

Vogliamo produrre un contenuto  che possa sottolineare gli svariati aspetti inerenti ai nostri shooting che per molto tempo avete richiesto. Sfrutteremo  quindi il nostro prossimo set insieme per veicolare questo contenuto. Il genere ovviamente sarà ritratto con il nostro tocco personale.
Sarà un set realizzato in una location professionale con  modelle professioniste e un videomaker a supporto.
Questo contenuto sarà un video pubblicato sul mio canale Youtube in cui spiegheremo nel migliore dei modi (secondo le nostre capacità) quella che è la progettazione, la fase di scatto e l'editing dei nostri scatti fino ad arrivare al prodotto finale.Abbiamo deciso di fare questo video insieme perché molto spesso ci siamo trovati a realizzare set fotografici insieme e condividiamo la maggior parte del processo creativo inerenti ad essi.
 
Motivazione della Campagna
La campagna ha lo scopo di supportare economicamente tutte le spese citate sopra. N.B: Leggere il paragrafo ""Alcuni chiarimenti""
 

Alcuni Chiarimenti

Il video verrà prodotto anche in parziale o totale assenza di supporto della community a nostre spese.
I soldi servono a darci più agio nella creazione. Maggiore è il supporto, maggiore potrà essere la qualità del video finale.
La campagna non è a scopo di lucro ovvero non è nostro obbiettivo guadagnare da questo contenuto.
Il ricavato superfluo verrà utilizzato per supportare ""Creators Magazine"" nella sua seconda edizione.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Green Project aims to give a voice to underprivileged teens through photography as they explore self-identity in relation to their environment; promoting positive self-esteem.</p>
<p>In 2013 we hope to buy, distribute and process 300 cameras for teens directly affected by domestic abuse, poverty and disability. We plan to then showcase these images online and in museum &amp; gallery settings in order to raise awareness, highlight diversity, and  illustrate through the creative process that their present circumstance does not define them nor diminish their worth. We strongly believe, that the while the cameras are disposable, the voices behind them are not.</p>
<p>Currently slated to work with teens affected by domestic violence in Larimer County, Colorado and in collaboration with deaf students in Mumbai, India; we seek to soon expand our efforts to some of the poorest counties in the United States, many on or near Native American reservations where teen suicide rates have reached epidemic proportions.</p>
<p>Green Project currently operates solely as an artistic endeavor (awaiting 501(c)3 recognition) teamed by dedicated volunteers with extensive backgrounds in holistic health, psychology and the visual arts. We are:</p>

</ul><p><strong>Goal:</strong></p>
<p>Our Mission for 2013 is to obtain and distribute 300 disposable cameras to underprivileged children locally in Colorado, nationally and globally:</p>
<ul>
<li>100 to be given to local teens, displaced by domestic violence and/or at-risk youth participating in similar community outreach programs</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>100 to be distributed to teens growing up in the poorest counties in the United States ( as defined by the last US Census)</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>100 to be given to Deaf Photography Students in Mumbai, India under the direction of noted photographer Rajen Nair @rajennair</li>
</ul><p>Our ultimate goal is to then display the images collected in museum and/or gallery settings, highlighting diversity and commonalities among participants. </p>
<p>All participants will receive prints of their work, and be required to choose a pseudonym to use in place of their name to best protect their identities and encourage them to give accurate and honest depictions of their social and physical environments without individual fear of ridicule or punishment.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<p>Currently our project's greatest obstacle is funding &amp; with your support that can change! Our funding request covers the cost of processing 300 cameras at an estimated cost of $100 dollars apiece in order to ensure deliver, return of prints, processing and getting the images ‘gallery ready’. Any additional funding raised for our project, will be used to offset operational costs which may arise from the our need to travel as a team, reimburse our volunteers for costs incurred, obtain additional operating equipment, and acquire office space (if necessary) to maintain the day-to-day operations of the project in order to best ensure its success.</p>
<p>In terms of local community involvement, we are soon slated to begin our work with a domestic violence shelter which serves as a safe haven for teens affected by abuse. We also have a longstanding relationship with an after-school outreach program targeting at-risk youth through a local university. Therefore, the ability to positively impact our own community is assured. We have the kids, we just need the cameras and the means.</p>
<p>Through our academic educations &amp; personal histories we have well established connections to various Native American communities and reservations throughout the United States, where teen suicide rates have reached alarming rates and far exceed the national average. We hope to target at least three counties affected by this crisis. A large portion of our funding will go toward ensuring we can meet with these participants, at least quarterly, in order to teach and/or assure they are familiar with basic principles of photography before distributing disposable cameras. We believe by establishing lasting relationships with participants over the coming year and being a consistent presence, it best guarantees the success of our project. What is best for the kids, is also best for us.</p>
<p>Noted photographer, Rajen Nair, will be assisting us in India by distributing cameras to Deaf Photography Students in Mumbai. We may experience some delays in shipment/ delivery with this group as no specific date ranges have been set. We will keep our sponsors updated routinely.</p>
<p>Our small but mighty team exists solely of three part-time volunteers. Therefore, our travel schedule will have to coordinate with personal, educational and professional commits already in place. We realize however that traveling is an essential component to the success to of our project and it is our aim to have all collected images processed no later than December 31, 2013.</p>
<p>The main focus of our current project is to obtain, distribute and acquire a diverse collection of images from the 300 cameras/ participants locally, nationally and globally. While our ultimate goal is showcase a large selection of these images in museum and galleries settings, time and funding may limit our ability to reach a wide audience range by the end of the year. Therefore we'll also be featuring a vast majority of these images online through various social media sites and webpages associated with our project.</p>

<h2>About the Campaign</h2>
<div>
<p>The Eastern Sierra Center for Photography (ESC4P) is the brainchild of founder Laura Campbell, an accomplished and published large format photographer.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>
<img alt=""Hello!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://lauracampbellfineart.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/images.jpeg"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin: 5px;"" title=""Hello!""/>The Center was conceived to promote the use of large format photography across economic, gender, and age boundaries.</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>This campaign is designed to launch our floating-platform <strong>Artist-in-Residence program</strong>. ESC4P seeks to fund 4 week-long programs in one of two locations, the chosen artists selecting the spot. Choices will be Lone Pine, CA, site of the Alabama Hills and close to Mt Whitney, Death Valley, the Eastern Sierra, and the Owens Valley, or Jerome AZ, an historic mining town with early western architecture in driving distance to Sedona, and the Grand Canyon.</p>
<blockquote><strong>The Center has partnered with View Camera Magazine, and artists will have their work published in the only periodical devoted exclusively to large format photography.</strong></blockquote>
<p>We will also be launching a Kids-In-the-Arts program in summer 2014, in Lone Pine, CA. We will begin with 2-day pilot programs to develop the appropriate curriculum, but always featuring large format work. Scholarships will be funded by ESC4P and a nominal charge to non-scholarship participants. <strong>We want to make our craft available to all who show interest.</strong></p>
<blockquote>Our long term goal is to have a facility in Lone Pine CA, where we can set up a darkroom, gallery, and class space.</blockquote>
</div>
<div>We will make the space available to visiting photographers as well as for seminars, workshops, and shows not limited to photography in the hope of promoting art in general.</div>
<div>
<h2>What We Need and What You Get</h2>
<p>What we need is funding for stipends and scholarships for Artist-in-Residence (AIR) photographers, material expenses, such as insurance, utilities, and renting a space for a darkroom for the AIR participant, and a small salary for the accompanying member of ESC4P. </p>
<blockquote>For every residency that provides a stipend, there will be another that provides a stipend and scholarship that covers accommodation; the artist just needs to get to the site.</blockquote>
<p>What you get for helping out, besides a happy glow, is a variety of goodies depending on your level of contribution. Hand silk-screened t-shirts; prints from <strong>Jim Fitzgerald, Laura Campbell, and Austin Granger; View Camera Magazine</strong> subscriptions; private workshops with Jim Fitzgerald or Laura Campbell; a custom made hand-knitted hat to keep you warm on winter shoots; a lush book of photographs by Austin Granger; a vacation rental, and more.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>Everyone wants to know that their treasured pastime, valued hobby, or livelihood will persist into the future. Large format photography is no different, especially in this day and age when many wonder why we do it anyway.</p>
<blockquote><strong>Funding an artist-in-residence program, and later education and outreach efforts, we spread the word about our craft.</strong></blockquote>
<p>Teaching teens about how to use a large camera gives an extraordinary sense of accomplishment, and we aim to make it as easy and immediate as possible. We'll use pinholes and instant film as well as printing out paper to mimic what we already see in digital media. Using a large camera teaches patience and perseverance, as well as develops the artistic eye.</p>
<p> </p>

<p class=""p1"">Study a map of Point Reyes and the names of its features as christened by its past explorers seem as if from fiction, from myth, as if from some ancient allegory: Point Resistance, Mount Vision, Secret Beach... There is a tangible air of mystery that permeates the peninsula as surely as its summer fogs. And nowhere on earth have I so strongly sensed the immanence of the Spirit.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Featuring eighty-three of my favorite photographs of the peninsula, ""Point Reyes"" is a testimonial borne of my adventures in that most extraordinary place.</p>

<p>Born in San Francisco in 1970, Austin Granger has worked as a baker, house painter, naval radar operator and camera salesman. He first began to photograph while studying philosophy in college as a way to get out of his head. Preferring to use a traditional view camera, Granger has come to see his photography as a spiritual practice–a way in which to shape his life, and enrich his relationship with the world. He likes motorcycles a lot too.</p>

<strong>Vacation Rental, Boyd Hotel, Jerome, AZ</strong><br/>Photo courtesy Jerome Historical Society<br/><br/>The Boyd Hotel was built in 1898 after Kitty Christians' original structure burned down. Kitty then married John D. Boyd in 1889. She renamed the new brick three story structure the Boyd Hotel. The upper two floors were a residence and transient Hotel. The lower housed multiple businesses over the years including a Meat market, the Club Bar, Billie's Exchange (saloon) a drug store and even a mortuary. <br/><br/>The building was purchased by the Jerome Historical Society in 1956. In 1978 the first floor was repaired to use as retail spaces. In 2003 the Society received matching funds from Arizona State Parks Historic Preservation Heritage Fund to restore the upper two floors. The upper two floors now have three apartments and one vacation rental managed by the Society.</div>

<h2>ESC4P AIR Program</h2>
<strong>ESC4P and View Camera</strong>
<p>ESC4P has partnered with View Camera Magazine. Artists participating in our Artist-in-Residence program will have their work published in the only periodical devoted exclusively to large format photography. Thank you Steve Simmons for your generosity and support.</p>
<blockquote><strong>What connects us all is our passion for large format photography. Let’s unite as a community and support one another. Together we can promote the continued use of the large format camera.</strong></blockquote>
<strong>About the ESC4P AIR Program</strong>
<p>Our artist-in-residency is open to anyone shooting large format, film or digital. Each artist will submit an application, a portfolio, and a letter explaining their goals for a residency. Subject matter while participating is wholly artist-driven though there are some expectations on behalf of ESC4P.</p>
<p>The resident is expected to donate 2 prints to the organization and an additional print to be gifted to either the Southern Inyo Hospital (if the residency is in Lone Pine), or the Jerome Historical Society for Jerome residencies.</p>
<p>The artist is also expected to plan one event to share their work with the public within the community they select, either an informal lecture or a demonstration. He or she will be aided in this endeavor by ESC4P staff who will provide the venue and supporting logistics. The event will be video taped to share online for public education.</p>
<p>Upon completion of the residency, the artist’s work will be featured in View Camera Magazine. At least two images must be from the residency, preferably more. The work will also be showcased on our website. When enough residencies have been completed, the work will become part of a traveling exhibit.</p>

<p> </p></div>","About the Campaign

The Eastern Sierra Center for Photography (ESC4P) is the brainchild of founder Laura Campbell, an accomplished and published large format photographer.
 

The Center was conceived to promote the use of large format photography across economic, gender, and age boundaries.
 
This campaign is designed to launch our floating-platform Artist-in-Residence program. ESC4P seeks to fund 4 week-long programs in one of two locations, the chosen artists selecting the spot. Choices will be Lone Pine, CA, site of the Alabama Hills and close to Mt Whitney, Death Valley, the Eastern Sierra, and the Owens Valley, or Jerome AZ, an historic mining town with early western architecture in driving distance to Sedona, and the Grand Canyon.
The Center has partnered with View Camera Magazine, and artists will have their work published in the only periodical devoted exclusively to large format photography.
We will also be launching a Kids-In-the-Arts program in summer 2014, in Lone Pine, CA. We will begin with 2-day pilot programs to develop the appropriate curriculum, but always featuring large format work. Scholarships will be funded by ESC4P and a nominal charge to non-scholarship participants. We want to make our craft available to all who show interest.
Our long term goal is to have a facility in Lone Pine CA, where we can set up a darkroom, gallery, and class space.

We will make the space available to visiting photographers as well as for seminars, workshops, and shows not limited to photography in the hope of promoting art in general.

What We Need and What You Get
What we need is funding for stipends and scholarships for Artist-in-Residence (AIR) photographers, material expenses, such as insurance, utilities, and renting a space for a darkroom for the AIR participant, and a small salary for the accompanying member of ESC4P. 
For every residency that provides a stipend, there will be another that provides a stipend and scholarship that covers accommodation; the artist just needs to get to the site.
What you get for helping out, besides a happy glow, is a variety of goodies depending on your level of contribution. Hand silk-screened t-shirts; prints from Jim Fitzgerald, Laura Campbell, and Austin Granger; View Camera Magazine subscriptions; private workshops with Jim Fitzgerald or Laura Campbell; a custom made hand-knitted hat to keep you warm on winter shoots; a lush book of photographs by Austin Granger; a vacation rental, and more.


The Impact
Everyone wants to know that their treasured pastime, valued hobby, or livelihood will persist into the future. Large format photography is no different, especially in this day and age when many wonder why we do it anyway.
Funding an artist-in-residence program, and later education and outreach efforts, we spread the word about our craft.
Teaching teens about how to use a large camera gives an extraordinary sense of accomplishment, and we aim to make it as easy and immediate as possible. We'll use pinholes and instant film as well as printing out paper to mimic what we already see in digital media. Using a large camera teaches patience and perseverance, as well as develops the artistic eye.
 

Doing things 'old school' is perennially popular with the young and is where we plant the seeds for the longevity of our passion.

Austin Granger's book, ""Point Reyes""


Study a map of Point Reyes and the names of its features as christened by its past explorers seem as if from fiction, from myth, as if from some ancient allegory: Point Resistance, Mount Vision, Secret Beach... There is a tangible air of mystery that permeates the peninsula as surely as its summer fogs. And nowhere on earth have I so strongly sensed the immanence of the Spirit.
Featuring eighty-three of my favorite photographs of the peninsula, ""Point Reyes"" is a testimonial borne of my adventures in that most extraordinary place.
""Beautiful"" –Diana Landau, Senior Editor, Sierra Club Press
""Wonderful"" –Michael A. Smith, Lodima Press
""Captivating"" –Claire Chandler, Merrell Publishers
Author Bio
Born in San Francisco in 1970, Austin Granger has worked as a baker, house painter, naval radar operator and camera salesman. He first began to photograph while studying philosophy in college as a way to get out of his head. Preferring to use a traditional view camera, Granger has come to see his photography as a spiritual practice–a way in which to shape his life, and enrich his relationship with the world. He likes motorcycles a lot too.

Jerome Historical Society Vacation Rental


Vacation Rental, Boyd Hotel, Jerome, AZPhoto courtesy Jerome Historical SocietyThe Boyd Hotel was built in 1898 after Kitty Christians' original structure burned down. Kitty then married John D. Boyd in 1889. She renamed the new brick three story structure the Boyd Hotel. The upper two floors were a residence and transient Hotel. The lower housed multiple businesses over the years including a Meat market, the Club Bar, Billie's Exchange (saloon) a drug store and even a mortuary. The building was purchased by the Jerome Historical Society in 1956. In 1978 the first floor was repaired to use as retail spaces. In 2003 the Society received matching funds from Arizona State Parks Historic Preservation Heritage Fund to restore the upper two floors. The upper two floors now have three apartments and one vacation rental managed by the Society.
 
 
 

ESC4P AIR Program
ESC4P and View Camera
ESC4P has partnered with View Camera Magazine. Artists participating in our Artist-in-Residence program will have their work published in the only periodical devoted exclusively to large format photography. Thank you Steve Simmons for your generosity and support.
What connects us all is our passion for large format photography. Let’s unite as a community and support one another. Together we can promote the continued use of the large format camera.
About the ESC4P AIR Program
Our artist-in-residency is open to anyone shooting large format, film or digital. Each artist will submit an application, a portfolio, and a letter explaining their goals for a residency. Subject matter while participating is wholly artist-driven though there are some expectations on behalf of ESC4P.
The resident is expected to donate 2 prints to the organization and an additional print to be gifted to either the Southern Inyo Hospital (if the residency is in Lone Pine), or the Jerome Historical Society for Jerome residencies.
The artist is also expected to plan one event to share their work with the public within the community they select, either an informal lecture or a demonstration. He or she will be aided in this endeavor by ESC4P staff who will provide the venue and supporting logistics. The event will be video taped to share online for public education.
Upon completion of the residency, the artist’s work will be featured in View Camera Magazine. At least two images must be from the residency, preferably more. The work will also be showcased on our website. When enough residencies have been completed, the work will become part of a traveling exhibit.

My name is Greg and I've been a professional photographer for over 10 years now. I've always been drawn to the strange and unusual. I enjoy experimenting with different styles and techniques, but my biggest passion is night photography and abandoned things. 5 years ago, I came up with a vague idea for an Alice in Wonderland themed shoot. After several months of planning, casting, and scouting, I was ready to take my first steps at capturing the ideas that had been in my head. My first shoot was the Mad Hatter. After that initial shoot, I knew I was onto something. I've spent the last 4 years and thousands of dollars of my own money bringing my creation to life. I've spent countless hours sewing all the costumes, scouting out locations, scouring antique stores, thrift stores, and e-bay for the perfect props and accessories to complete each scene. It's proven to be a much more difficult project than I originally anticipated due to the immensity of my vision and multiple setbacks. The project has already seen 3 recasts as models have moved away due to the long gaps between shoots. I've come to crowdfunding to help speed up the production cycle and complete my passion project.</p><p> </p><p>So, what am I looking for? I believe I can complete this project with only $4,000. Where does that money go?</p><p> </p><p>1. COSTUMES:</p><p>The largest portion of the money will be going towards completing the costumes. I still need to create several costumes for two of the larger group shots. The first shoot is for Rose and the flowers. The idea is, Rose will be dressed as a Victorian Madame with the flowers as colorful concubines. I'm talking corsets, hoop skirts, the whole shebang. The second shoot is for the card soldiers. My vision includes A Clockwork Orange-esque hooligans, but with more fetish wear.</p><p> </p><p>2. UPGRADES:</p><p>As this project has grown in scale and interest, I've put more time and resources into each subsequent costume. A portion of the funding will go to upgrading and reworking earlier costumes to match the newer ones. Since multiple shoots have required recasting, some costumes or parts of them need to be resized and resewn entirely.</p><p> </p><p>3. PROPS:</p><p>Your donations will also go to purchasing props and accessories to give the sets that extra pop.</p><p> </p><p>4.

I knew after only a year or two of working on the Alice project that there was a large chance that I’d need to turn to crowdfunding to finish it, but it was incredibly important to me to put everything I could into it.

</p><p>Hi all.</p>
<p>I am an artist / photographer dedicated
to erotica and nude photography, living in Spain. As an artist,
looking for my photography and explores the personal and human lafo
photographed each girl, and fled perched those that do not reflect
the reality of each. I do not use Photoshop to edit the image because
I believe in pure photography, but shooting in digital. My specialty
is black and white, but I shot some photos in color. 
</p>
<p>In Spain it is not as yet accepted this
style of photography, there is a taboo on the nude and is quite
difficult to break through the sole aim of erotic photography. But it
is my dream, I think much of my work and photography as art, and my
principles will not let me leave what fills me: eroticism. 
</p>
<p>Fortunately
I've done a couple of exhibitions in Art Galleries. In my personal
website you can see my artwork, my gallery, curriculum, and read my
reviews of art (in Spanish). My photos have also been in some
International Art Fairs (in Europe). Website:
<a href=""http://rauldap.weebly.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://rauldap.weebly.com</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately,
even a dream that did not allow me to live and invest in my work. My
camera, a DSLR semi-professional, is giving me many problems and
sometimes does not shoot, making it very difficult affects my
concentration and my creativity, and consequently, the desire to take
pictures decreases and the quality is affected ... 
</p>
<p>Buying
a better DSLR is a very large and important expense that I can not

save money for superior photographic equipment on my own.

<p>Through

<p><strong>¡ÚNETE A MAMBO!</strong></p>
<p><strong>¿Qué es Mambo#2?</strong><br/>Mambo#2 es el segundo volumen impreso nacido de la revista digital del mismo nombre. Siguiendo la filosofía de nuestro proyecto, Mambo#2 reúne en sus páginas a once excelentes fotógrafos de diferentes países, culturas, edades y estilos, para mostrar su obra tal como es, sin caer en detalles técnicos, ni grandes alardes de diseño, ni consideraciones que vayan más allá de la fotografía misma.</p>
<p>Así pues, Mambo#2, más que un libro de fotografía es un libro de fotógrafos. Y de sus obras. Es un reconocimiento al trabajo de los fotógrafos ya consagrados que aparecen en él, de la misma manera que esperamos sea un impulso para los jóvenes talentos con quienes comparten estas páginas.</p>
<p>Mambo#2 también es –o esperamos que sea– un libro inspirador y un placer para todos los amantes de la fotografía y todos aquellos que quieran perderse en las historias que surgen de sus imágenes.</p>
<p><strong>¿Quiénes son los fotógrafos que saldrán en Mambo#2?</strong><br/>Como una imagen vale más que mil palabras (y más hablando de fotografía), ponemos más abajo los nombres de los once fotógrafos seleccionados, acompañados de una de sus fotos.</p>
<p><strong>¿Por qué comprar una versión impresa de Mambo, si la versión online ya funciona?</strong><br/>Porque, a pesar de la tremenda importancia que ha adquirido Internet en la vida de todos, creemos firmemente que la fotografía, para ser disfrutada plenamente, tiene que estar impresa sobre un buen papel, que se pueda tocar, sentir y conservar. Además, estarás apoyando a que los fotógrafos publicados en Mambo sean reconocidos en todo el mundo, sin mencionar que este libro es una opción asequible para los amantes de la fotografía y de los libros de fotografía que existen.  </p>
<p><strong>¿Existirá una versión digital de Mambo#2?</strong><br/>Existirá una versión digital únicamente como <em>reward</em> para quienes apoyen esta campaña de <em>crowdfunding</em>. No colgaremos en Internet ninguna versión digital de Mambo#2, como no lo hicimos tampoco del volumen anterior.</p>
<p><strong>¿Las fotos de Mambo#2 han salido ya publicadas en la versión digital?</strong><br/>Algunas sí<strong>; </strong>otras, han sido cedidas por los fotógrafos expresamente para este libro.</p>
<p><strong>¿En que idioma está Mambo?</strong><br/>Al igual que el primer volumen, Mambo#2 es una edición bilingüe castellano/inglés.</p>
<p><strong>Me interesa vuestro proyecto pero no sé inglés y no entiendo qué es cada ""<em>perk""</em>.</strong><br/>Los <em>perks</em> estipulan lo que cada colaborador recibe a cambio del dinero que aporta. <a href=""http://mambomag.com/testdir/000Rewards"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Puedes ver una versión traducida de éstas en nuestro website, clicando aquí. También se incluye el precio aproximado de cada perks en euros.</a></p>
<p><strong>¿Cómo es Mambo#2, físicamente hablando?</strong><br/>Mambo#2 es un volumen de 19 x 27 cm y 124 páginas, diseñado e impreso con el máximo cuidado sobre papel estucado arte de 135g.</p>
<p><strong>¿Por qué necesitáis 15.000 dólares (unos 11.800€)?</strong><br/>Los gastos de diseño y pre-impresión los tenemos cubiertos. De los 15.000 US$, aproximadamente 800 son para pagar las pruebas de color, 8.700 son para los costes de impresión, 200 para realizar la versión digital, unos 3.000 para la distribución y los 2300 restantes son para cubrir los gastos del crowdfunding, las tarifas bancarias y posibles (y probables) gastos imprevistos.</p>

Through my work I look to denounce these terrible situations, it´s my way to show to the world the things that are happening in my country, where working as a journalist is one of the most difficult jobs to do.

It has been my work in Venezuela the reason I have been selected from more than 2900 applicants to participate in the Fifth New York Portfolio Review, organized by The New York Times and the City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism, where the most important editors from the United States and Europe from the most recognized medias, galleries, museums, and many others, can check my work personally and possibly get future working opportunities to continue to  push my career and my message.
This amazing opportunity came alongside two invitations made by important institutions: Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston, I was invited to speak about my work covering the collapse of Venezuela’s health system and the impact in recent and old virus as Zika, Malaria.

Karla 16 (L) and Aurelys (R) help his mother Ingrid Castellanos (C), a 40 years old domestic worker from Cararacas who have cervical cancer that turns in metastasis two months earlier. Aurelys (18) left her civil construction studies as well as her maintenance work in the weekends to stay and help her mother during her sickness.
 
These three events represent a great opportunity, not only in a personal aspect but also to share and spread knowledge and awareness to the situation in my country around the world.
Unfortunately, and as a consequence of the hard economical situation in Venezuela I have not the necessary funds to afford this journey, and that’s why I hope to reach this goal with your support.

To afford plane tickets, housing, feeding and transportation expenses during my time in Boston and New York City, places where those events are going to be held, the goal is to reach US$ 3000.
Every contribution will be a great support to my career as a photojournalist at the same time it would allow me to find new spaces in the media industry to show the struggle of my people in my homeland.
Rewards for your contribution:
If is not much what I can offer, this is what I would give you to those who support me on my goal:

Mi nombre es Manaure Quintero y soy fotoperiodista freelance nacido y radicado en Caracas, Venezuela, un país que actualmente enfrenta la crisis más dura de su historia: una altísima inflación, la mayor tasa de asesinatos de los últimos años, una confrontación política que afecta social, económica y políticamente a los venezolanos, desnutrición, violencia en diferentes ámbitos, derrumbe del sistema de salud, corrupción... A través de mi trabajo fotográfico busco denunciar estas terribles situaciones, es la forma que tengo de mostrarle al mundo lo que sucede en mi país, a pesar de que se ha convertido en uno de los lugares más difíciles para ejercer el periodismo.

<h1>ABOUT THE BOOK</h1>
<p>The most ambitious, exciting winemakers in the world aren’t coming from Europe, or even Napa Valley. The focus of the wine world has turned to a former cow town that is now making the <b>most coveted wines in the word</b>: Paso Robles, California.</p>
<p>Many readers may have been introduced to the region in the <b>Oscar®-winning movie “Sideways” </b>(shot in nearby Santa Barbara County)<b> </b>. But for the last 20 years, ambitious winemakers have been making incredible, unique, delicious vintages that challenge everything we thought we knew about wine. They continue to <b>turn the wine world on its head</b>, and they're loving every minute of it.</p>

<p>My name is <b>Julia Perez </b>and I am a professional photographer from Argentina<b>.</b> I love wine and I am fascinated with winemakers. Over the last few years I have been fortunate to have taken photos of vineyards, wineries and winemakers all over the world. Last year I teamed up with legendary California wine writer <b>Paul Hodgins</b> and spent an entire vintage embedded with 50 of the most ambitious and influential winemakers and vintners in Paso Robles.</p>
<p>The result is <b>""The Winemakers of Paso Robles""</b>, a large format, full-color book, lovingly crafted and designed to take you beyond the cellar door, deep into the art and science of making the finest wines in the world, and celebrating the men and women who dedicate their lives in this California region to the pursuit of liquid perfection.</p>

<h3>EVERY WINEMAKER &amp; VINTNER HAS A STORY</h3>
<p>An accidental meeting, a change of circumstances, an influential person or even a bolt from the blue in the middle of the night. Everyone has their own path that led them to a life of winemaking - a balance of art and science, physically demanding and mentally strenuous - lives of passion, and pursuit, and struggle.</p>
<p>To a winemaker, every vintage is its own discrete labor of love. A game of <b>3-dimensional chess</b> against the elements, coaxing the <b>perfect balance</b> from the sun, the soil, rain and vine. If they get any one of a thousand decisions wrong, the vintage can be ruined and they have to wait another year to try again. But get it just right, and they’ve created <b>magic in a glass</b>.</p>

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>""Surveillance Landscapes"" is a series that I've been working on for two years. To produce this work, I tap into surveillance cameras, public webcams, and CCTV feeds around the world in pursuit of the “classical” picturesque landscape. The resulting visual product becomes dislocated from its automated origins and leads to an investigation of land, borders, and power. The surveillance state is totalizing in its global reach and we must look at how this effects us from all perspectives. Nevertheless, the very act of someone surveying a site through these photographic systems implies a dominating relationship between man and place.</p>

<p>I am working with Daylight books to produce a monograph of this work for publication in the spring of 2018. The costs will go directly to the editing, production, and distribution of  this book.

""Surveillance Landscapes"" is a series that I've been working on for two years. To produce this work, I tap into surveillance cameras, public webcams, and CCTV feeds around the world in pursuit of the “classical” picturesque landscape. The resulting visual product becomes dislocated from its automated origins and leads to an investigation of land, borders, and power. The surveillance state is totalizing in its global reach and we must look at how this effects us from all perspectives. Nevertheless, the very act of someone surveying a site through these photographic systems implies a dominating relationship between man and place.

I am working with Daylight books to produce a monograph of this work for publication in the spring of 2018. The costs will go directly to the editing, production, and distribution of  this book. This includes working with multiple editors on layout and design, multiple proofs, and the production of the book at a professional press.
Book Details 

Photographs: approx. 40-44 images 
Size: approx. 8 in x 11 in hardcover 
Edition: First run approx. 1000
Publication date: Spring 2018

About the artist:Marcus DeSieno is a lens-based artist who is interested in how the advancement of photographic technology has changed our relationship to the natural world. DeSieno often combines antiquated and obsolescent photographic processes with contemporary imaging technologies to engage in a critical dialog on the evolution of the photographic medium in relation to seeing. He received his MFA in Studio Art from the University of South Florida and is currently the Visiting Professor of Photography at Marlboro College in Marlboro, Vermont.DeSieno's work has been exhibited nationally at The Center for Fine Art Photography, the Fort Wayne Museum of Art, The Light Factory, Candela Gallery, Rayko Photo Center, The Center for Photography at Woodstock, and various other galleries and museums. His work has also been featured in a variety of publications including FeatureShoot, GUP Magazine, Hyperallergic, Huffington Post, National Geographic's Proof, PDN, Slate, Smithsonian Magazine, and Wired. DeSieno was recently named a selection for Photolucida's Critical Mass 50 and an Emerging Talent by Lensculture for 2016.About Daylight:Daylight is a non-profit organization dedicated to publishing art and photography books. By exploring the documentary mode along with the more conceptual concerns of fine-art, Daylight’s uniquely collectible publications work to revitalize the relationship between art, photography, and the world-at-large. Risks and challenges:The risks and challenges when publishing a photobook include the possibility of delay, but we are aiming for a release in early Spring of 2018.

<p><b>The back story</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><p>In Ethiopia I did a story about two
young women who suffered the devastating consequences of obstetric fistula and
as a result lost their babies at childbirth. Both young women were left
incontinent and alone in their huts. Helping them to reunite with their
families after successful surgery was one of the most rewarding experiences of
my life.</p>
<p>
Thanks to the work I produced in Ethiopia, the
United Nations Trust Fund To End Violence Against Women hired me to go to India
and Bangladesh to produce four stories and report back about how the UN’s money
was being put to use. I covered different aspects of violence against women
including dowry related issues, sex workers, migrant workers and the challenges of aboriginal Indians known as Adivasi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While on this project with UN Women
and on the way to a remote village to talk to a group of sex workers we drove
by a sugarcane factory and I was astonished by what I saw. It was a tent city
in the shadow of a huge factory complex. I asked the driver to stop so I could
go interact with some of the people there.  It was during this twenty minute
stop that I saw some disturbing things.</p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/912925/files/20141007195006-IMG_4745.jpg?1412736606"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">
</span></p><p>I learned that these migrant workers
harvest the sugarcane from around November through March each year. The workers
often travel for a few days on ox carts to get to the factory. Often they will bring
their entire family including children and the elders. It is this whole family unit
that sets up in the tent city and remains there while the harvesting continues.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/912929/files/20141007195116-UN_Women-4740_copy_2.jpg?1412736676"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>
</p><p>The work is both backbreaking and

<p>
</p><p>Knowing that at any given time at any
place on this earth there are stories that can be shared that will inspire,

<strong>BETA TESTER'S COMMENT:</strong> </h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>“Having an easy to use microscope in the pocket of your jacket opens a world of possibilities to observe the deeper details of Nature inners working in everyday life. I have been carrying Blips with me for some times now and I ended up pulling it out in many occasions for a quick glance (and picture) at otherwise hidden and fascinating phenomena. With its ease of use, portability and performance such a small object expands so much our vision that it is even difficult to forecast in how many ingenious and artistic ways it can be used.”</i> </p>

<p><strong>REVIEW FROM BETA TESTERS AROUND THE WORLD:</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>""The blips lenses are awesome! They are so easy to use, you just stick the micro or macro lens on your phone's camera (they literally are stickers) and you are ready to blip away. They are small and lightweight which allows you to have them always available, hence you never have to say again: ""Oh I wish I had my camera with me"". I have them in the back of my phone I love taking pictures with an artistic flavor to them as a hobby. I especially like taking pictures of insects, flowers and skin. Blips allows you to take pictures with great zoom (micro mode) which otherwise would require a dslr with a special lens (if not a microscope). With blips, anyone can become an artist! It's so easy to take beautiful, artistic pictures!""</i></p>

<p>It allows you to take high definition macro pictures with optical magnification of about 10 times. It is extremely thin, about 1/50 inch (0.5mm), and very user friendly. It represents the first step from “standard” photography towards portable microscopy. Its working distance, i.e. the distance between the lens and the focal plane, is of about 1/2 inch (12mm). </p>

<p>Blips Micro is able to detect details of about 1/7000 inch (≈1/300 mm), distinguishing single cells or other inhabitants of the micro-world. BLIPS Micro is less than 1/20 inch (≈1.2mm) high, and turns your phone into an actual digital microscope. You need to keep a distance of ¼ inch (6mm) between the lens and the sample under observation to discover tiny details at a high definition. With the use of the digital zoom it’s possible to achieve magnification of over <strong>100x*</strong>. </p>

<h3>WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MICRO, MACRO AND THE NEW ULTRA? </h3>
<p><strong>MACRO:</strong> The best option to observe insects or objects in motion. Its deeper focus allows you to easily follow the subject you are examining. </p>
<p><strong>MICRO:</strong> For higher magnification; maximal resolution (ability to see small details) can be achieved by using transmitted light through the subject you are observing (for example using prepared slides and a light source from behind)</p>
<p><strong>ULTRA: </strong>The brand new Blips Lens with the highest magnification. It requires a Lab Kit Pledge to work, as it provides the proper stand to guarantee the necessary stability to view and photograph slides and objects</p>

<p>1) Clean the glass of the camera with a piece of fabric or cloth to make sure dust and grease are properly removed  </p>
<p>2) Lift BLIPS by one end</p>
<p>3) Keep the two ends of the film facing upwards, align the lens on the camera and press it onto the glass window; it will adhere electrostatically, do not be afraid to touch and press the lens with your finger</p>
<p>4) Stick the rest of the film onto the smartphone body</p>
<p>5) Open the App (available freely for Android and IOS).</p>
<p>6) Move your device close to the subject under observation; the distance is 12mm for BLIPS Macro and 6mm for Micro. Put the lens as closer as possible to the sample and slowly move backwards until the image is focused, or use the sponge to easily find the correct distance. If light conditions are weak, activate the flashlight mode on your mobile (by activating the flash command in app)</p>

<p>1) In order to achieve the best performance possible, make sure your Blips lens is aligned well on the camera.  </p>
<p>2) When sticking the lens onto the camera, try to reach the best optical contact between the two surfaces; make sure the surface between the film and the glass looks black and does not present any bubble. </p>
<p>3) In order to improve adherence: </p>
<p>• clean the glass from grease or dust <br/>• press the lens against the camera with your finger <br/>• warm the film up (best when &gt; 20°C) and, whenever possible, the device, in order to improve the conformability of the film <br/>• gently clean the rear side of the lens from grease or dirt by using water or soapy water</p>
<p><strong>BLIPS REQUIRES LITTLE MAINTENANCE</strong></p>
<p>Keep BLIPS on the camera for as long as you need; you can stick the BLIPS lenses on your camera or nearby for a whole day or more. When you do not use BLIPS for long periods, place the lenses back on their original card. Keep them in your wallet, bag, or anywhere you want. <br/>Avoid to press on the lenses for extended periods. The adherence might be weak when applied below 15°C (50F).</p>

<p>Each element is composed of a specifically designed objective lens, placed on a flexible film. The back side surface of the flexible film sticks on the glass of the mobile device (phone or tablet) covering the camera, by electrostatic forces. No glue is used behind the lenses, so there are no residues on the camera when the lens is removed. The film is long enough to ensure easy handling and correct lens alignment on the mobile device camera. Two sticky bands, made of specifically engineered material for multiple and clean use, help to keep the BLIPS firm on the device surface, on either glossy or matt device surface, without using unwieldy spring clips pressing against the touch screen of your device.</p>

<p>BLIPS SmartMicroOptics Srl (SMO)’s first product and it’s the result of a technology transfer from the “Italian Institute of Technology”. Although it was born in a research lab, it has been designed for mass production from the very beginning. Even if extremely thin, BLIPS is a composite: part of it is made by using standard components and processes which were already largely available form a list of suppliers of SMO, while SMO is in charge of the rest of the fabrication process, setting the manufacturing facility for large production. The current manufacturing capability, in lab scale, is of 100 BLIPS per day, which will be scaled up during the next weeks, according to the success of the campaign. All the materials constituting BLIPS come from European and US suppliers. The accessories have been selected by testing a number of components available on the market, specifically designing new components and establishing relationships with reliable external manufacturers, aiming at the highest level of satisfaction of the backers. <br/>BLIPS is a brand new product; in order to test and improve it in the last months we have distributed many samples (approximately 100-150) to different people in terms of age, culture and education levels, collecting comments and suggestions for a proper development of the product. The feedbacks were usually enthusiastic, even for the first prototypes. The founder of SmartMicroOptics is experienced in start-up creation and rump-up production; nevertheless, since BLIPS is the first product of a new company, some unexpected issues might arise when changing facilities and when passing from the lab scale to mass production. In order to face some of these problems, we have designed a modular production facility for fast and easy scalability. <br/>Logistics and communication issues could arise, especially in case of a high number of backers. We have already established agreements with a company with previous experience in Kickstarter campaigns, in order to support our efforts throughout this adventure. We will do our best to stay on track and to reward our backers and fulfill their expectations. This would be the first step of a structured project, the first product out of a list we are planning for the near future, and we don’t want to fail this first milestone.</p>

BETA TESTER'S COMMENT: 
“Having an easy to use microscope in the pocket of your jacket opens a world of possibilities to observe the deeper details of Nature inners working in everyday life. I have been carrying Blips with me for some times now and I ended up pulling it out in many occasions for a quick glance (and picture) at otherwise hidden and fascinating phenomena. With its ease of use, portability and performance such a small object expands so much our vision that it is even difficult to forecast in how many ingenious and artistic ways it can be used.”

No unwieldy spring clips pressing on your touch screen

HIGHLY ADJUSTABLE: to fit any devices  
You can cut the film using scissors, shaping BLIPS as you prefer. The two sticky bands are meant to enhance adherence onto non-polished surfaces; the lens will always stick on the glass when the surface is clean.

EASY TO CLEAN: dust free, non-sticky top surfaces 

 
(Do not touch the adhesive bands often. Grease and dust affect their adhesive strength.) 
SUPER COMPATIBLE: it works on all models of smartphones and tablets

From neuroscience labs to your pocket! 
BLIPS has been developed within the neuroscience labs of the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT) exploiting the materials and the methods used for the manufacturing of micro devices for the investigation of neuronal networks. Although it was born in a research lab, it has been designed for mass production from the very beginning. 

REVIEW FROM BETA TESTERS AROUND THE WORLD:
""The blips lenses are awesome! They are so easy to use, you just stick the micro or macro lens on your phone's camera (they literally are stickers) and you are ready to blip away. They are small and lightweight which allows you to have them always available, hence you never have to say again: ""Oh I wish I had my camera with me"". I have them in the back of my phone I love taking pictures with an artistic flavor to them as a hobby. I especially like taking pictures of insects, flowers and skin. Blips allows you to take pictures with great zoom (micro mode) which otherwise would require a dslr with a special lens (if not a microscope). With blips, anyone can become an artist! It's so easy to take beautiful, artistic pictures!""
Vicky P. Phd Student, UC San Diego - USA 

It allows you to take high definition macro pictures with optical magnification of about 10 times. It is extremely thin, about 1/50 inch (0.5mm), and very user friendly. It represents the first step from “standard” photography towards portable microscopy. Its working distance, i.e. the distance between the lens and the focal plane, is of about 1/2 inch (12mm).

Hence, it can be used like a high power magnification lens for precision works or for several other applications where an enhanced electronic eye is desired, from technical uses to sheer fun. For example, it can be used for quality control of soldering works, on cloth, seams, paints or other manufactured items. Needle and thread insertion, self-examination of moles, skin, or nails, children’s hair inspections for head lice/nits, insects or spiders observation, checking of parasites on leaves, etc.

Blips Micro is able to detect details of about 1/7000 inch (≈1/300 mm), distinguishing single cells or other inhabitants of the micro-world. BLIPS Micro is less than 1/20 inch (≈1.2mm) high, and turns your phone into an actual digital microscope. You need to keep a distance of ¼ inch (6mm) between the lens and the sample under observation to discover tiny details at a high definition. With the use of the digital zoom it’s possible to achieve magnification of over 100x*. 

cerebellum / trachea / liver shot with BLIPS Micro
*Note: the magnification factor depends on the model of smartphone or tablet used. To measure the magnification factor we suggest to take a picture of two tick marks on a ruler and measure the captured image on the screen. Other products claimed magnification factors often prove lower than claimed when tested by using this method.

WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MICRO, MACRO AND THE NEW ULTRA? 
MACRO: The best option to observe insects or objects in motion. Its deeper focus allows you to easily follow the subject you are examining. 
MICRO: For higher magnification; maximal resolution (ability to see small details) can be achieved by using transmitted light through the subject you are observing (for example using prepared slides and a light source from behind)
ULTRA: The brand new Blips Lens with the highest magnification. It requires a Lab Kit Pledge to work, as it provides the proper stand to guarantee the necessary stability to view and photograph slides and objects



 



1) Clean the glass of the camera with a piece of fabric or cloth to make sure dust and grease are properly removed  
2) Lift BLIPS by one end
3) Keep the two ends of the film facing upwards, align the lens on the camera and press it onto the glass window; it will adhere electrostatically, do not be afraid to touch and press the lens with your finger
4) Stick the rest of the film onto the smartphone body
5) Open the App (available freely for Android and IOS).
6) Move your device close to the subject under observation; the distance is 12mm for BLIPS Macro and 6mm for Micro. Put the lens as closer as possible to the sample and slowly move backwards until the image is focused, or use the sponge to easily find the correct distance. If light conditions are weak, activate the flashlight mode on your mobile (by activating the flash command in app)


LAB KIT INSTRUCTIONS 


NOTE: for smartphones that have the camera lens near the corner (for example iPhones), you can turn the extra film around the edge of the device or you can cut it away with scissors, as in the illustrated instructions. 

1) In order to achieve the best performance possible, make sure your Blips lens is aligned well on the camera.  
2) When sticking the lens onto the camera, try to reach the best optical contact between the two surfaces; make sure the surface between the film and the glass looks black and does not present any bubble. 
3) In order to improve adherence: 
• clean the glass from grease or dust • press the lens against the camera with your finger • warm the film up (best when > 20°C) and, whenever possible, the device, in order to improve the conformability of the film • gently clean the rear side of the lens from grease or dirt by using water or soapy water
BLIPS REQUIRES LITTLE MAINTENANCE
Keep BLIPS on the camera for as long as you need; you can stick the BLIPS lenses on your camera or nearby for a whole day or more. When you do not use BLIPS for long periods, place the lenses back on their original card. Keep them in your wallet, bag, or anywhere you want. Avoid to press on the lenses for extended periods. The adherence might be weak when applied below 15°C (50F).
THE APP PROVIDED IS IOS AND ANDROID COMPATIBLE  
The app adjusts your device’s settings in order to use it with Blips. 
USER FRIENDLY interface / LED TORCH command / AF Block / Easy sharing

If your device does not support Android or IOS you can easily use Blips with your favorite application, making sure the subject you are examining is exposed to enough light. If possible, lock the autofocus and visualize the captured images on full screen. 



BLIPS PROTECTS YOUR PRIVACY!
While playing around with BLIPS, we casually found out that when lenses are attached to a Mac / PC Camera, it also provides a strong privacy barrier, offering 2 different degrees of blurring. No more prying eyes on your devices! A cool extra perk to make good use of BLIPS.


BLIPS (patent pending technology) is made of composite multilayered structures. All the materials constituting BLIPS come from European and US suppliers. 

 
Each element is composed of a specifically designed objective lens, placed on a flexible film. The back side surface of the flexible film sticks on the glass of the mobile device (phone or tablet) covering the camera, by electrostatic forces. No glue is used behind the lenses, so there are no residues on the camera when the lens is removed. The film is long enough to ensure easy handling and correct lens alignment on the mobile device camera. Two sticky bands, made of specifically engineered material for multiple and clean use, help to keep the BLIPS firm on the device surface, on either glossy or matt device surface, without using unwieldy spring clips pressing against the touch screen of your device.

LENS:  
Extremely thin --> Macro Lens ≈ 0.5mm, Micro Lens<1.2mm

Risks & Challenges
BLIPS SmartMicroOptics Srl (SMO)’s first product and it’s the result of a technology transfer from the “Italian Institute of Technology”. Although it was born in a research lab, it has been designed for mass production from the very beginning. Even if extremely thin, BLIPS is a composite: part of it is made by using standard components and processes which were already largely available form a list of suppliers of SMO, while SMO is in charge of the rest of the fabrication process, setting the manufacturing facility for large production. The current manufacturing capability, in lab scale, is of 100 BLIPS per day, which will be scaled up during the next weeks, according to the success of the campaign. All the materials constituting BLIPS come from European and US suppliers. The accessories have been selected by testing a number of components available on the market, specifically designing new components and establishing relationships with reliable external manufacturers, aiming at the highest level of satisfaction of the backers. BLIPS is a brand new product; in order to test and improve it in the last months we have distributed many samples (approximately 100-150) to different people in terms of age, culture and education levels, collecting comments and suggestions for a proper development of the product. The feedbacks were usually enthusiastic, even for the first prototypes. The founder of SmartMicroOptics is experienced in start-up creation and rump-up production; nevertheless, since BLIPS is the first product of a new company, some unexpected issues might arise when changing facilities and when passing from the lab scale to mass production. In order to face some of these problems, we have designed a modular production facility for fast and easy scalability. Logistics and communication issues could arise, especially in case of a high number of backers. We have already established agreements with a company with previous experience in Kickstarter campaigns, in order to support our efforts throughout this adventure. We will do our best to stay on track and to reward our backers and fulfill their expectations. This would be the first step of a structured project, the first product out of a list we are planning for the near future, and we don’t want to fail this first milestone.",66.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>  Hi, thanks for visiting my IndieGoGo and for watching my video! Man do I love being on camera! HARRR!</h3>
<h3>     My name is Nicole Mark and I am a Portland, Oregon native. I've been making photos since I was ten years old, when I acquired a little 110 camera. I started out taking grainy photographs of my friends at summer camp, and I haven't stopped taking photos since.   </h3>
<h3>     After taking a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doula"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Doula</a> workshop last spring I realized that I wanted to photograph births and expecting mamas. This part of a woman's life is so special and beautiful. It is an honor to be present for a birth, and to help preserve these precious memories. There is so much fear around birth in our culture, I am excited to be part of the movement to dispel those fears. If there is any way I can show women around the world how empowering birth can be, I'm there.</h3>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v475/nicopico/IMG_8002_1sm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>What I Need and What You'll Recieve</h3>
<h3>     Now that I have started a business I need a decent digital camera and lights. I need a camera that can shoot in low light conditions, for example, at a home birth. I also need studio lights for mama belly and family portraits.</h3>
<h3>     Help me earn the equipment I need by pledging to this IndieGoGo! You will be rewarded with something no matter how much you pledge. Do you need a photo print for yourself or to give as a gift? Do you want a photo shoot? Please see my list of rewards for pledges starting at ten dollars. Some examples of printable photos are at the bottom of this page. You can visit my <a href=""http://nicolemarkphotography.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WEBSITE</a> or my <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/nicomark/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Flickr Page</a> to see more examples of my work and choose a photo for printing, should you decide to make a pledge. (Nudes and Mamabelly photos are not an option)</h3>
<h3>You do not have to choose a photo immediately, you can pledge now and choose later. Please include your contact information and address when you make a pledge!</h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<h3>     If I can raise enough funds to get a decent digital camera and studio lights I will be able to take my business ten times further. At the moment I am unable to do much with indoor photogrpahy, which is really limiting when you're trying to photograph births! I need a full-frame digital camera that will allow me to take photos in low-light settings. For example, at a birth, or in the forest at dusk. <span style=""color: #222222;"">Technology has done a lot for image quality in the last ten years. Newer digital cameras are capable of taking crisp clear photos in very low-light conditions</span><span style=""color: #222222;"">. They can also photograph many images per second, so you can capture the most amazing moments. The bare minimum in studio lighting will allow me to photograph</span><span style=""color: #222222;""> people in so many different ways. Lighting affects facial features, mood, depth of field and many other aspects of a photograph. Basically lighting is everything- and I need to be able to control it! Instead of waiting for the sun or the clouds to do what I want.</span> Every little bit helps me earn this equiptment!</h3>
<h3>     If I go over the minimium amount needed to get a good camera and lights I will be able to buy a new/used computer! My current computer is 7-years old and will likely die soon. Not to mention I need something with adeqate processing power when working with large photo files.</h3>
<h3>                     Thanks again for visiting my IndieGoGo!</h3>

</div></div>","Hi, thanks for visiting my IndieGoGo and for watching my video! Man do I love being on camera! HARRR!
     My name is Nicole Mark and I am a Portland, Oregon native. I've been making photos since I was ten years old, when I acquired a little 110 camera. I started out taking grainy photographs of my friends at summer camp, and I haven't stopped taking photos since.   
     After taking a  Doula workshop last spring I realized that I wanted to photograph births and expecting mamas. This part of a woman's life is so special and beautiful. It is an honor to be present for a birth, and to help preserve these precious memories. There is so much fear around birth in our culture, I am excited to be part of the movement to dispel those fears. If there is any way I can show women around the world how empowering birth can be, I'm there.

What I Need and What You'll Recieve
     Now that I have started a business I need a decent digital camera and lights. I need a camera that can shoot in low light conditions, for example, at a home birth. I also need studio lights for mama belly and family portraits.
     Help me earn the equipment I need by pledging to this IndieGoGo! You will be rewarded with something no matter how much you pledge. Do you need a photo print for yourself or to give as a gift? Do you want a photo shoot? Please see my list of rewards for pledges starting at ten dollars. Some examples of printable photos are at the bottom of this page. You can visit my WEBSITE or my Flickr Page to see more examples of my work and choose a photo for printing, should you decide to make a pledge. (Nudes and Mamabelly photos are not an option)
You do not have to choose a photo immediately, you can pledge now and choose later. Please include your contact information and address when you make a pledge!
The Impact
     If I can raise enough funds to get a decent digital camera and studio lights I will be able to take my business ten times further. At the moment I am unable to do much with indoor photogrpahy, which is really limiting when you're trying to photograph births! I need a full-frame digital camera that will allow me to take photos in low-light settings. For example, at a birth, or in the forest at dusk. Technology has done a lot for image quality in the last ten years. Newer digital cameras are capable of taking crisp clear photos in very low-light conditions. They can also photograph many images per second, so you can capture the most amazing moments. The bare minimum in studio lighting will allow me to photograph people in so many different ways. Lighting affects facial features, mood, depth of field and many other aspects of a photograph. Basically lighting is everything- and I need to be able to control it! Instead of waiting for the sun or the clouds to do what I want. Every little bit helps me earn this equiptment!
     If I go over the minimium amount needed to get a good camera and lights I will be able to buy a new/used computer! My current computer is 7-years old and will likely die soon. Not to mention I need something with adeqate processing power when working with large photo files.
                     Thanks again for visiting my IndieGoGo!

                                           Love Nicole


Other Ways You Can Help
     If you cannot make a pledge you can still spread the word! Do you know anyone who needs a photoshoot or some art for thier walls? All of the listed pledge amounts come with a reward of some form of art. Please share this with your communitiy and/or your network! Thank you!
     Thank you Lyle Walker for all your help with video production and for letting me borrow your camera! Thank you Talia Filipek for turning me onto Lynsey Stone, her work is hugely influential and important. Thank you Pam for all your technical knowledge and help. Thank you to my family, my community and Paul Wolda for all your support!

It used to be a school, and my bedroom was an old classroom! While I was there, I became completely obsessed with exploring the place and the surprisingly raw and passionate feelings it gave rise to inside me, and I did this through taking hundreds of polaroids and writing poetry.

</p><p>“Every accomplishment starts with a decision to try”</p>
<p>I started this campaign weeks ago, because it was pressed on
my heart to do so and give it a try. I admit, it was not an easy decision for
me to make. In fact, I broke down in tears after it was done. However, I know
in my heart that this is something that God wants me to do for one reason or
another, so I do so obediently. </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The power of an image is unexplainable. It can change the
way you feel in a moment, the way you see the world, they way you see yourself,
as well as the way others see you. I want to share with the world the beauty
that I see in it everyday.</span><br/></p>
<p>The first thing thought that came to me when I recognized
that this was what I was to do with my life, was “how can I give back?”  You see, since I have been an adult, I have
always struggled financially. I have always managed to make it through because
of my faith in God and at times the amazing generosity of other people. The
desire to “pay my blessings forward” has been ever present within me. So
besides the benefit of being able to financially improve my family’s situation,
I needed to seek out how I could also improve others lives. </p>
<p>I thought of the dreams, I had when I was young. I wanted to
be an actress. Straight out of high school, I would go to auditions and the
first thing I was told was “You need an 8X10 headshot”. I didn’t have headshots
or the money for headshots. I tried working around it though. I would have
people taken pictures of me and print them out on 8X10 paper. It was not the
quality that was expected, but it was enough to get me through the door. I
remember thinking, “It honestly cannot be THAT important…can it?” I soon found
out it was. A talent agency that was interested in me refused to sign me until
I had professional headshots taken. It was not something I could do, so I eventually
gave up. I realized later that it was not the avenue I wanted to pursue with my
life. However, the experience left a mark.</p>
<p>So that’s when the ideas hit me on how I could give back
through this dream. I want to donate a portion of my talent and time to charity
work. I want to be able to have a few days set aside where I can shoot
professional headshots for amazingly talented young people who honestly cannot
afford to have them done otherwise. I want to help give them what they need to
pursue their dreams. </p>
<p>So here I am, with this campaign that I was led to start. I
can give you a long story, but quite simply, my family cannot afford to make
any of this happen. The reality is, I can barely afford to feed my children or
pay rent. I hope that I can use the equipment I am fundraising for to make a
better future for my family. I hope that I can generate enough added income to
help us breathe a bit easier each month. I hope I can use these tools to bring
joy and promise to the lives of others and help answer a few prayers along the
way. </p>
<p>This is the holiday season. I know we are all stressed and
money is tight. I completely understand if you cannot offer any support to this
campaign at this time. Prayers would be greatly appreciated. However, if you
can afford to offer even the tiniest of bits, I would be forever grateful. </p>
<p>Blessings and love to each and every one of you. </p>

through this dream. I want to donate a portion of my talent and time to charity
work. I want to be able to have a few days set aside where I can shoot
professional headshots for amazingly talented young people who honestly cannot
afford to have them done otherwise. I want to help give them what they need to
pursue their dreams. 
So here I am, with this campaign that I was led to start. I
can give you a long story, but quite simply, my family cannot afford to make
any of this happen. The reality is, I can barely afford to feed my children or
pay rent. I hope that I can use the equipment I am fundraising for to make a
better future for my family. I hope that I can generate enough added income to
help us breathe a bit easier each month. I hope I can use these tools to bring
joy and promise to the lives of others and help answer a few prayers along the
way. 
This is the holiday season. I know we are all stressed and
money is tight. I completely understand if you cannot offer any support to this
campaign at this time. Prayers would be greatly appreciated. However, if you
can afford to offer even the tiniest of bits, I would be forever grateful. 
Blessings and love to each and every one of you.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

While incredible, the ideas that started swirling in my head got more and more ambitious.  I decided to follow in the tradition of some of the pinnacles of American photography and explore the Southwestern United States.  From <a href=""http://anseladams.com/about-ansel-adams/ansel-adams-slideshows/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ansel Adams</a> to the <a href=""https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/meet-photographers-charged-documenting-depression-era-america-farm-security-administration-180964123/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">FSA</a> (click links to learn more) the varied and often barren landscape of the southwest have been an inspiration for photographers for decades. </p>
<p>To further those traditions my work has been and will continue to be shot on both black &amp; white and color film. I currently have one 35mm Minolta SLR, one 35mm Fujifilm point-and-shoot, and a 6x9 medium format Fujifilm GW690ii.  The medium format camera will likely be my primary focus on the trip, however it only takes 8 shots per roll of film so it is going to get pricey.</p>
<p>The end goal of this is to make and (hopefully) publish a book, or several books, depicting the southwest. I create books as a way to slow down the reading of my images. Most of my work is shot in a way that brings up more questions than answers: Why does someone have windows on their garage when they drive a beaten-up Honda from the 90s like in my series <i>The Midwestern Suburbs</i>? What is obscured in the bleached-out segments of film in my <i>Homesick</i> series? The answers the viewer comes up with can fill in the blanks and create their own narratives. </p>
<p>While the grant money was a boon, it all went to getting my car up to the point that it will survive the trip. I've been saving up, but art supplies and lodging are expensive.  I am fully prepared (and excited) to sleep in my car and hammock for most of the trip in order to purchase enough film to make this book. However, I'd love to sleep in a bed every now and then. My route takes me through a number of cities, big and small, and a number of national and state parks. But this isn't me begging you for money or anything, I just know the more I have the cooler things I'll be able to see- which also means the cooler print you'll get in return! I am not expecting 500 but that is the minimum goal amount- the nice thing about this site is that I'll still get it if it's below the goal unlike Kickstarter.</p>

<h3>Here's the story...</h3>
<p>My name is Jason Speer and I am a professional photographer currently based in Greensboro, North Carolina.  I earned my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Photography from the Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD).  Over the last eight years, my wife Erin and I have moved around the United States living in California, Wyoming, Florida, Pennsylvania, New York and North Carolina.  Erin and I are both artists, and our creative work has been the impetus for each of these moves.   </p>
<p>For many years, I've been photographing and editing content for companies and individuals.  As I approach my 35th birthday in March, I am finding myself drawn back to shooting work that represents my own voice.  It is a lifetime dream of mine to shoot the Aurora Borealis: the Northern Lights.  With a few weeks of free time on my hands, my wife has encouraged me to grasp the opportunity and check this item off of my bucket list.  In order to do it right, I will need to be in Iceland for two weeks car camping and photographing 24/7.  This is a solo trip, my Jack Kerouac moment.</p>
<p>My previous trip to Iceland was incredible.  It opened my eyes to the vast beauty, wild spaces and diversity of the Icelandic landscape.   Between the timing of that visit, which was in the height of summer (so no Aurora Borealis) and my responsibilities, I left Iceland feeling ready to return.  That 2016  visit was an incredible opportunity, but I still feel that the island has more to say to me.</p>
<p>While we are self-funding most of this trip, I am seeking financial support to help cover the cost of my transportation/mobile housing and a special tour of ice caves.  My rental van is outfitted for car camping with a sleeping space that we hope will accommodate my 6'5"" frame.  Your financial support will also help to book a safe tour of the Ice Caves, and buy me the occasional shower.  No one wants to sit next to that on the plane.</p>
<p>I plan on driving the entire island, weather permitting.  The drive should take ten days to do it right, and I'm leaving myself a cushion of two extra days in case I fall in love with a particular location and want to stick around for a while.  I depart the United States on October 22 and arrive in Iceland on October 23. </p>
<p>I will posting to my Instagram account daily while in Iceland, so you can follow along with my trip. @jasonspeerphoto. Please be sure to pop up and say hi.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here's the breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>What I need: <u><strong>$800</strong></u> to help offset the cost of my rental van.  </li>
<li>
<strong>Donations up to $49</strong> will receive my eternal gratitude and a thank you shout-out on social media.</li>
<li>
<strong>Donations greater than $50</strong> will receive an 8x10 photographic print of my choosing from the trip - hopefully of the Aurora Borealis I'm chasing.</li>
<li>
<strong>Donations of $100</strong> and up will receive a 16x20 photographic print of my choosing from the trip - hopefully of the Aurora Borealis I'm chasing.</li>
<li>
<strong>Fund the entire amount - $800</strong> - and I will frame and sign that 16x20 print for you.</li>
<li><i>*All Prints will be mailed by the end of November, making them a great idea for Christmas Presents!*</i></li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Your Impact</h3>
<p>Your support will help me create a dynamic series of images that I plan to pitch to various photography magazines and journals.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Challenge</h3>
<p>The end goal of this trip is to come away with twenty photos that I can pitch to outdoor photography magazines in hopes of receiving a featured spread or offers for future work.  I've spent so many years helping others get published, now it's time to bet on myself!</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand that not everyone has the means to help monetarily, so here are a few other ways you can help!</p>

<p><b>ABOUT THE PROJECT: </b></p>
<p>“The skateboard
itself holds no power. It is a simple lifeless scrap of wood with a piece of
metal and wheels strapped to it. The magic happens when a human controls it.
Then it becomes a form of entertainment, a piece of sporting equipment, and a
membership to a worldwide brotherhood.” – Amigo Skate Cuba</p>
<p>I have been
traveling to Cuba with Amigo Skate since <span>April 2015. Amigo
Skate is </span>not part of a big corporation or a nonprofit. They are a
movement dedicated to peace and unity through action sports, music, and art.
Founded in 2009, their movement is led by a group of likeminded friends who
decided that if they wanted the world to change, they would have to do it themselves.
To eliminate the red tape that usually slows down most charity
missions, they are 100% volunteer-based and self-funded. </p>
<p>Amigo Skate collects unwanted or
broken skateboard equipment, and then refurbishes, rebuilds, and recycles it back
to skaters in need in Cuba. Amigo averages
around <b>ONE TON</b> of donated product
per trip, including skateboards, music gear, and art supplies, and have
impacted the lives of hundreds of kids over the past five years. Pro-skaters and action sports celebrities like <b>CJ Ramone</b>, <b>Chris Casey</b> from
the <b>Fuel TV <i>Captain &amp; Casey Show</i></b>, and <b>Chris Pontius</b> from <b><i>Wild Boys</i></b> and <b><i>Jackass </i></b>have also traveled to Cuba with Amigo Skate.  </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">On my travels with Amigo Skate, I not only document the organization
in action, but I also document the human lives they touch: the kids who don’t
have access to skateboarding gear or clothing, or who don’t have an outlet to

<h1>What is the project about?</h1>
<p>
Dream sequence is a long-term photographic project, which has taken over 3 years to complete. It oscillates around the portraiture of unconventional fictional figures seen “at the crossroads between fashion, photography, performance and art” (Sharon D. Lloyd). In doing so, the main inspiration has evolved from surrealism and film, specifically referencing Alfred Hitchcock's - “Spellbound” dream scenes;  while considering the philosophical concept of the beautiful and sublime.
</p>
<p>
All the protagonists were shot in-camera with minimal (that is, only essential) retouching involved. As part of this in camera process, body painting, prosthetics, wigs, unusual 3D make-up techniques as well as real flowers were used in order to enhance and distort the bodies of the models.
</p>

<p>
The series was initiated in Germany and originally styled and conceptualized as a solo project. I continued the project in London, where I have worked and developed its visual nuances with a regular team who have constituted the core of the project – stylist Stella Gosteva, and make-up artist Marina Keri. In addition, I have collaborated with a variety of eminent up-and-coming designers from the leading Fashion and Art Schools in Europe. It is the involvement and donation of these unusual and beautifully crafted pieces that have crucially contributed to the creation of the final images.
</p>
<p>
The series won The seltmann+söhne Advertising Award in Germany, the Double Gold at PX3 in Paris, and recently they received an honourable mention at the International Photography Awards in NY. It has exhibited across Europe and recently showcased at the National Arts Club in Manhattan, New York, which has provided a wide exposure in many established international publications within fashion, photography and the arts

INDIEGOGO – BOOK CAMPAIGN
What is the project about?

Dream sequence is a long-term photographic project, which has taken over 3 years to complete. It oscillates around the portraiture of unconventional fictional figures seen “at the crossroads between fashion, photography, performance and art” (Sharon D. Lloyd). In doing so, the main inspiration has evolved from surrealism and film, specifically referencing Alfred Hitchcock's - “Spellbound” dream scenes;  while considering the philosophical concept of the beautiful and sublime.


All the protagonists were shot in-camera with minimal (that is, only essential) retouching involved. As part of this in camera process, body painting, prosthetics, wigs, unusual 3D make-up techniques as well as real flowers were used in order to enhance and distort the bodies of the models.




The series was initiated in Germany and originally styled and conceptualized as a solo project. I continued the project in London, where I have worked and developed its visual nuances with a regular team who have constituted the core of the project – stylist Stella Gosteva, and make-up artist Marina Keri. In addition, I have collaborated with a variety of eminent up-and-coming designers from the leading Fashion and Art Schools in Europe. It is the involvement and donation of these unusual and beautifully crafted pieces that have crucially contributed to the creation of the final images.


The series won The seltmann+söhne Advertising Award in Germany, the Double Gold at PX3 in Paris, and recently they received an honourable mention at the International Photography Awards in NY. It has exhibited across Europe and recently showcased at the National Arts Club in Manhattan, New York, which has provided a wide exposure in many established international publications within fashion, photography and the arts


The book is addressed to anyone who is interested in the topic of character design (both in fashion and performativity), make-up / hair design, body hybridisation, aesthetics, and the philosophical approach to beauty and sublime within photography as a “documentation tool”, as well as a record of the extensive creative process.

I was 20, with two weeks of college and with the wish of making this land the school for my life.               El caballo se impone como eje y fundamento en este ensayo porque desde el primer momento fue quien me inyectó el alma de los llaneros, me hizo sentir que quería aferrarme a su misterio, a ese estilo semi-nómada en que esta gente vive y trabaja.The horse imposes itself as the main axis and the base for this essay because from the first moment it was the one who injected the soul of the Llaneros into me, and made me feel that I wanted to hold onto his mystery, to that semi-nomad style in which these people live and work.               El caballo me hizo vivir la tierra, me transformó como ser humano, como mujer. Mi manera de pensar la vida empezó a tejerse con la idea de lo errante, de la distancia, de las pocas pertenencias. El caballo aquí se vuelve el símbolo de las relaciones entre llanera y llanero, de sus encuentros y despedidas, de historias de amor que terminaron siendo también las mías.The horse made me live the land, transformed me as a human being, as a woman. My way of thinking about life began to weave with the idea of the errant, of the distance, of the few belongings. The horse here becomes the symbol of the relationships between the “llanera” (cowgirl) and the “llanero” (cowboy), of their meetings and farewells, love stories that also became mine.                                                Uno de los primeros caballos que conocí en el Hato llevaba por nombre ‘’Volví por verte’’, ¿No era acaso lo mismo que yo buscaba? Y ese otro de color bayo al que nombré ‘’Adiós que me voy’’ que tanto me acompañó en los trabajos. Un llanero cuenta su vida por los caballos que ha tenido, yo hasta ahora tengo dos caballos que me dieron en los Hatos ; Chemerejure y el Secreto, hoy en día viven en Matabrava. El primero que me dieron, el de la foto arriba de este texto, es la imagen que abre este libro, irrumpiendo con la fuerza visceral que a ambos nos caracteriza.Se ve todo de mi en su noche. En el llano dicen que uno se parece a sus caballos o ellos a uno, este es un retrato de lo que juntos vivimos. One of the first horses that I met in the “Hato”  was named “I came back to see you again”.  Wasn’t this the same I was looking for? And that other one with a golden color which I named “Adios because I am leaving” and who accompanied me so many times in the works. A “llanero” tells his life by the horses he has had, and so far I have two horses that they gave me at the “Hatos”: Chemerejure and The Secret … today the live at “Matabrava”.- The first one they gave to me, Chemerejure, is the image which opens the book, bursting with the visceral force that characterizes both of us. Everything about me can be seen in his night, at the “llano” they say that we resemble our horses or they resemble us, it is a picture of what we have lived together, of what we became together.             Llano es un viaje épico a través de los caminos de los Llaneros, gente que habita y recorre las sabanas de la cuenca del Orinoco en Colombia. El relato se construye entre invierno y  verano que es a su vez el escenario físico y psicológico donde transcurren las historias más íntimas de hombres y mujeres que siguen soñando con una tierra de caballos salvajes y distancias sin cerca.“Llano”  is an epical journey through the paths of the Llaneros (cowboys), people who inhabit and roam the savannahs of the Orinoco River basin in Colombia. The story is built during winter and summer, in the physical and psychological scenery where the more intimate stories take place, of the men and women who continue dreaming about a land of wild horses and distances without fences.                El libroMusuk Nolte, editor del libro, se unió a este proyecto de vida. Desde la convivencia,  la amistad  y su silencio tan oportuno construyó un escenario donde yo pudiera  enfrentarme a todo lo vivido, a darle un lugar a los sentimientos y un tono que contuviera el misterio de este viaje.  Lo más importante para mi del proceso es sentir que ese otro, Musuk, se apropia de mi memoria o de un tramo de mi vida y hacemos una voz, una voz que se pregunta: ¿Cómo escuchar el Llano en las imágenes?  ¿ Cómo prescindir de los textos y testimonios para construir un lenguaje visual que represente la voz de la gente y  tenga la atmósfera de todo lo vivido? ¿Cómo dejar un rastro de la ausencia, del amor, del ahogo, de la fuerza? ¿Cómo nombrar todo lo que me conmovió y estremeció en esta tierra? ¿Por su nombre? Llano.The bookMusuk Nolte, editor of the book joined this life project. From sharing time and friendship together, and with his so timely silence, he built a scenery where I could face everything I had lived, where I could give a place to my feelings and a tone that could contain the mystery of this journey. The most important part for me of the process was to feel that the other one, Musuk, takes hold of my memory, or of a stretch of my life, and we generate a voice, a voice that asks “How to listen to the “Llano” through the images?, How to do away with text and testimonies to construct a visual language that represents the voice of their people and containing the atmosphere of all that was lived? How to leave a trace of the absence, of the love, of the lack of breath, of the strength? How to tell about everything that had moved and shaken me in this land? By its name?: LLANO  Llano será impreso en España con los mejores estándares de producción, el diseño ha estado a cargo de Juanjo Justicia del Estudio Underbau en Madrid y su producción esta programada para el mes de junio.  En este momento la edición esta terminada y estamos afinando algunos detalles de la portada.LLANO will be printed in Spain with the highest standards of production, the design has been under the leadership of Juanjo Justicia of the Underbau Studio in Madrid and production is scheduled for the month of June.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">2018 AVIATION ART calendar</h2>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502808921/rxl1auu8sqmqfaua8os4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Hey guys. It's that time of the year again. It's time for the 2018 Aviation Art Calendar. This year it's going to be better than ever and I am so excited to share with you all the improvements that I am working on.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Past</strong></p>
<p>For those who don’t know me I am an airline pilot and professional photographer at the same time. I've got a lot of responsibilities and I love both of my passions. In 2016 I have published my first wall calendar in a limited edition run and sold it out in about a month.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503634818/mvilfcaxfxihpqlw5coo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>For the great success I have published the 2017 calendar as well and now it's time to create the 2018 calendar. There are a lot of aviation wall calendars out there so what makes this one different? Aviation Art Calendar is created with photography art in mind in the first place and only then taking its subject ""airplanes"" as a secondary objective.  By doing so I have gained respect and firm place in the aviation photography field which was confirmed by the Federation of European Photographers (FEP) and numerous customers.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504085173/cticb5arka28oia81wqe.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Present</strong></p>
<p>This time the 2018 calendar will be printed by industry standard full-color offset printing for great color reproduction and double the size than previous years for greater impact which will make it 60 x 42 cm big. It will have laminated front and back cover pages and same as previous years no one will be cut short of his favorite airplane type or photography style. Fans of civil, military or old, new or even fast vs. slow airplanes all will be pleased to have their plane included in this year's issue. Regarding photography style you can expect full color and duotone photographs, close-ups or more environmental looking images, but still carrying my signature style making it eye-catching, minimalistic, calm and bold at the same time. Simply the calendar is perfect for anyone who loves good photography and airplanes. What I love the most about the photography is the freedom of expression and the ability to tell the story and so if you buy the Aviation Art Calendar you are not just buying a calendar that you can get in any office or book store, you are becoming a person with taste, you are gaining the access and  opportunity to decorate your living space with a valuable art where these eye-catching photographs are presenting the world of aviation in a calm yet majestic way where simple shapes and colors are left to speak for themselves.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Future</strong></p>
<p>To make it affordable I have to print in large quantities and this year I have set modest goal to publish 100 piece limited edition. But my goal for the year 2019 is to bring it to even more crowd, to make it even cheaper by maintaining or even increasing the quality. To reach this goal I will have to print some, say, 300 pieces. This is not impossible, however to achieve this goal I will really need your help. If you show me your support, it will allow me to cut the price by half and it will give me so much needed momentum to publish my long time project the Aviation Art Book which is currently in the prototype stage but will need a print run of 1000 piece to make it affordable.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Afterword</strong></p>
<p>None of my calendar or book projects is something profitable, it cannot be, there is just too many items on the market, but I see this as my life journey, my way of leaving something behind, my will to push myself and the art of photography to the new heights.</p>
<p>One of the ways how to find the funds for my projects is to run a Crowd Funding campaign on the IndieGoGo website.</p>
<p>Please follow the link and you can pre-order now and if you have any friends who love aviation and photography too please share with them and let them know this product is out there and together we can help others to nicely decorate our homes and offices in 2018.</p>
<p>In advance I would like to say big THANK YOU to all my previous and future supporters, thanks to You I am where I am now and as you can see, I was already able to increase the size and print quality while maintaining almost the same price. For sure together we can create something even bigger and memorable.</p>
<p>Please feel free to visit my websites to learn more about me and my work. Thank you for your time and support.</p>
<p>Yours</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Funds Use, Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>The calendar is to be self published and Since this is my first Crowd Funding campaign I will take it easy and will try to rise just 1/3 of the funds required for the project with rest of the funds to be sourced elsewhere. This campaign acts as a pre-order strategy to raise the funds for printing. Printing, publishing and launching of the calendar is estimated to be completed by October 2017. I don’t foresee any challenges since I am very determined to do this project.</p>

None of my calendar or book projects is something profitable, it cannot be, there is just too many items on the market, but I see this as my life journey, my way of leaving something behind, my will to push myself and the art of photography to the new heights.
One of the ways how to find the funds for my projects is to run a Crowd Funding campaign on the IndieGoGo website.
Please follow the link and you can pre-order now and if you have any friends who love aviation and photography too please share with them and let them know this product is out there and together we can help others to nicely decorate our homes and offices in 2018.
In advance I would like to say big THANK YOU to all my previous and future supporters, thanks to You I am where I am now and as you can see, I was already able to increase the size and print quality while maintaining almost the same price. For sure together we can create something even bigger and memorable.
Please feel free to visit my websites to learn more about me and my work. Thank you for your time and support.
Yours

Funds Use, Risks & Challenges
The calendar is to be self published and Since this is my first Crowd Funding campaign I will take it easy and will try to rise just 1/3 of the funds required for the project with rest of the funds to be sourced elsewhere. This campaign acts as a pre-order strategy to raise the funds for printing. Printing, publishing and launching of the calendar is estimated to be completed by October 2017. I don’t foresee any challenges since I am very determined to do this project.",11.0,0,"1 Campaign

Jamie was an extremely talented photographer. His work ranged from beautiful landscapes of the North East surroundings to delicate and eye catching portraiture. Being overly modest about his talent resulted in Jamie never exhibiting any of his pieces, so we are going to do it for him!


The Impact
On the 20th of November we will be hosting a day in memory of Jamie at The Knack Club, Seaham. At 4pm we will start the day off with the exhibition of Jamie's photography. The photographs will then be auctioned at 7pm at a starting price of £40. All proceeds will be donated to The Huntingtons Disease Association. In order to be able to auction the photography to raise money for this charity. We need to get as much money together to be able to print the photos and frame them. This is where you come in!

What We Need & What You GetWe need to raise at least £200 in order to print and frame the photographs.(Please note that the goal on this website says £500 as this is the least amount you can campaign for using this service, however we only need £200. Just to save confusement).

<p>My walk starts in 2010, as a former Network Technician at such a young age I've had it all. Two years after graduating High School I landed a double degree and landed a real job in the industry. I'm going somewhere in life, I'm going to make it and make it good. 2010, the same year my little brother revolutionised my perspective as a whole on life. He brought home a bass guitar.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">A magical bass? I wish. What was magical though was his constant attempts just to get it right. Everyday he would be at this; everyday. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Couple months ahead lead to an acoustic guitar and everyday he would practice without reason, only just to get it right. My curse for curiousity was born.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">This is my first step within my project where my life begins. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Curiosity</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> allured me to pick up the guitar and play. I sucked at it. It was a full sized guitar which made my hands cramp, my strums were uncoordinated and messy, it wasn't me. Next thing you know, he brings home a ukulele which I fell in love with.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">It was small, light, had two lesser strings and it was the first contact I made with anything I can relate passion with. Fast forward to a couple months down the road and I am already teaching my friends how to play ukulele. Fast forward a couple months and my Youtube account is created and I've begun to learn something else. I sing. Fast forward two more years and you'll find me sitting in my home studio writing to the world about something new that I have learnt and have absolutely gone insane about. To be a person who is able to capture a snippet of life and present it to the world as his own vision and show his audience what it means to be a photographer.</span></p>
<blockquote>If you can smell the street by looking at the photo, it's a street photograph - <b>Bruce Gilden</b>
</blockquote>
<p>I've broken through doors of all sorts of hobbies. I've danced for a crowd, drawn as a child, sang to an audience, maintained networks of business firms, driven fast cars, ran charity events, made friends across the world and partied with celebrities; my bucket list is labelled spontaneous and is never destined to finish. What I have paused it all for is photography.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Bokeh is what got me first, how on earth are these photographers achieving such great photos?! It was killing me that I couldn't get the same quality of bokeh on my old camera phone at the time. Early 2012 I decided to give photography a go. With an expert tech background operating a camera should be child's play.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Saved up about $600 dollars and grabbed myself a Canon Kiss X5 and the 18-55mm kit lens after countless hours of DigitalRev and whatever else I could learn on Youtube. The first minutes spent shooting my first DSLR was on toys. I could not get over the fact that if I let the shutter run for longer I'd be able to get great lighting even though my room is pitch black after the lights go out. Curiousity kicks in, what else can I do? Couple days later, I went outside to shoot. I was amazed by what I could do in low light in my room, my amazement once again established when my camera saw daylight. Metering shot through the roof, I now have the power to capture any moment from now on in my life at 1/400th of a second. I've always wanted to have a super power as a kid, this cuts close enough.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">At this point in time I am fighting for my exemptions at university. It was impossible for me to not resit several exams I have done in the prior years even though I have proof of identical exams and a grade book to prove it. It killed me to stay and redo everything I've done for another two years so I got a job at a bar and left university to take time and consider where I am going next.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I'm currently almost two months out since I've left the bar after working there 9 months and within these two months I have dedicated myself to photography. I took photos for events that came up at the bar, I went to car meets and took photos of modified cars and I also went overseas and brought my camera this time round and made sure I kept and brought back all my digitized memories.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The seed has begun to sprout. I started to make up excuses to bring my camera out. I'd always be late to my singing lessons because the trains always delayed me so I'd take the train that got me there half an hour earlier. I used this time to shoot street.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Street shots are complex. The gist wasn't enough, I've learnt all the fundamentals of photography but it wasn't enough. I wanted to know more.</span></p>
<h2><br/></h2>
<h2>Discover</h2>
<p>The curse of curiousity has taught me the value of wisdom, as the value of wisdom has taught me the gift of intelligence. These attributes have redefined my life as a whole and I now for once can comfortably say that I have a direction. I have a five year plan, I have a life long plan. My name will be remembered, I now know what I want to do and god damn it I am going to be great.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I started from the roots, bought my first book that I intentionally wanted to seriously read front to back. ""Understanding Exposure"" by Bryan Peterson. This book solidified what I already understood with the fundamentals of photography. The second book, ""The Birth of Photography"" by Brian Coe gave me the knowledge of how far photography has come till today. What i still didn't know was how to take a great photo and consistently take photos in great manner.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Curiosity had given birth to what I claim as seriousness and commitment to what I have dedicated myself to do for the rest of my entire life. Everything I didn't know about photography I studied. Wake up, stream videos online about anything that I could find about photography and learn it. Brush my teeth, back to my desk and I continue to study through other resources. I'd only leave my desk to eat, shower or go to the loo. Insanity for knowledge had begun. If I didn't know something about photography, I will know by the end of the day.</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h2>Take flight</h2>
<p>It's 3AM in the morning and I am quite pleased with my short draft of reflection. I've done street, I've shot models, cars have been snapped, interviews have been smashed, my status as a photographer is on the rise. I write this today because I've currently hit a wall.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I've thrown out my queen sized bed and replaced it for a futon couch. Add two extra desks and a bunch of old junk that I deem magical because it comes from a time where I don't have much photos from. What I have now is a 3m wide steel frame my Dad help me weld up standing about 2.4m tall and a giant piece of white fabric I bought for $18 attached to the steel frame via coat hangers and a super bright living room lamp that gives off a burning smell when I put it on blast.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I've spent about two months under constant study and had regular shooting sessions whether it be street, model, car or chasing the damn sunset in traffic. I learn and apply what I learn immediately. Insanity for knowledge increases my satisfaction for improvement.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The fundamentals are all in memory movement. With one more step mastering pre focus techniques I will be content with my skills as a proclaimed professional.</span></p>
<p>All professionals have specific tools to aid in their performance to portray what they've learnt. I am an artist and a professional seeking a hand from anyone who is willing to help me.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">If you've read this far into my story I admire your commitment and thank your curiosity for accepting time out of your life to indulge in what is running through mine. This is how I want people to feel when they see my photos. There should be a connection established and an understanding of what is going in within that moment of life.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Finally I shall conclude my little story with why I began it in the first place. I am limited to a crop sensor camera and I am yearning for a full frame. I can't fully utilise my lenses as they are intended to and it really makes a difference with the 1.6x conversion.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Camera: Canon 5D Mark II/III (depending on how well this goes)</span></p>

In a time of cultural erasure and displacement, highlighting the history and beauty of the neighborhood and its people is as important as ever. AKITO TSUDA Born in Hamamatsu, Japan, Akito Tsuda first arrived to Chicago in 1990 while a student at Columbia College. As a newcomer in a foreign place, he felt at home with and was particularly fascinated by the Pilsen community. Through his street and portrait photography, he came to be welcomed by the people living here, in an extraordinary and moving illustration of intercultural understanding.​""Taking a photo of people on the street has influenced my awareness in many ways .

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Hello! My name is Leah Marie and I have been on a yearlong
journey thru a project I call the 52 Week Photo Challenge. My 2014 news year’s
resolution was to expand my knowledge of photography, build a kick ass
portfolio and to reflect on my own photographic process! Since then I have made
my best attempt at one personal creative photo project every week for 12
months.</span></p>
<p>Share House Photography was born out of a creative living space.
What all started as a simple loft has now become a photo studio, a gallery, an artist’s
workspace and so much more. The Share House has gathered quite a following and has
built a community of ambitious, likeminded individuals. </p>
<p>The 52 Week Photo Challenge was my own endeavor to expand my
knowledge and skills as a photographer. The challenges came from a variety of
places and morphed into something completely unexpected each time. Every week I
would blog about my photo challenges and was thrilled to receive so much
positive feedback. The best was when my friends would tell me how my challenges
inspired them to challenge themselves. I noticed that I was invoking creativity
in my community and that just makes me want to do even more. </p>
<p>As the year comes to an end my challenge is almost over but
I can assure you that it won’t stop there. In 2015 my goal is to challenge
myself on a monthly basis. I will be doing a 12 Month Photo Challenge but my
ideas are bigger and better then ever before and will require more planning and
collaboration between a crew of creative minds. I have already begun to put a
team together to help inspire each project and to cultivate big concepts in
artistic ways. </p>
<p>This project is a means of expression and communication and
aims to send compelling messages along side imagination and artistry.
Photography inspires us to see things in a way we would have never seen them
before. Photos have begun to replace words and have given us a universal
language. With this global dialog we tell stories with images all over the
world. </p>
<p>So far my Challenges have been operating on a small scale with
shared equipment that is no longer available to me. This is where you come in!
With your donations I will be able to have my own camera and equipment allowing
this project to evolve. If I reach my goal I plan to buy a Canon 5d MarkIII, a 70mm-200mm lens and two Photogenic studio strobe lights. That my friends basically totals $6,000 right there, can you believe it. Your gifts will help make the 12 Month Photo Challenge
a reality and will give me the opportunity to continue my work. </p>
<p>In the New Year I will be showing The 52 Week Photo
Challenge in my private gallery. If you donate now to this campaign you will
get a special invitation to join me for some wine at this event. If you donate
even more I am offering myself and my services, to create with you, for you!</p>
<p>Each and every Challenge this year has taught me something
unexpected. Creativity is a process and inspiration comes from the most unpredictable
places. I learned that practice gets you one step closer to perfect and that a
little challenge can go a long way. I have realized that things don’t always go
according to plan but the possibility of something more beautiful may just come
of it. Pushing myself this year has increased my expertise as a photographer. Stepping
out of my comfort zone and trying new things made me realize that that is where
the magic happens. </p>
<p>I challenge you to challenge yourself this year. What will
you do?</p>

Spread the word about my </span><span style=""font-size: medium; font-weight: normal; line-height: 26px;"">campaign by posting it on social media. Maybe one of your friends will see it and want to help out, and that connection would have never happened if it was not for you. I am also looking for help with my Challenges. This year I am going to need a big crew and we still have some holes to fill in. For example I am in need of a make up artist and a couple of interns</span>!</h3>

myself on a monthly basis. I will be doing a 12 Month Photo Challenge but my
ideas are bigger and better then ever before and will require more planning and
collaboration between a crew of creative minds. I have already begun to put a
team together to help inspire each project and to cultivate big concepts in
artistic ways. 
This project is a means of expression and communication and
aims to send compelling messages along side imagination and artistry.
Photography inspires us to see things in a way we would have never seen them
before. Photos have begun to replace words and have given us a universal
language. With this global dialog we tell stories with images all over the
world. 
So far my Challenges have been operating on a small scale with
shared equipment that is no longer available to me. This is where you come in!
With your donations I will be able to have my own camera and equipment allowing
this project to evolve. If I reach my goal I plan to buy a Canon 5d MarkIII, a 70mm-200mm lens and two Photogenic studio strobe lights. That my friends basically totals $6,000 right there, can you believe it. Your gifts will help make the 12 Month Photo Challenge
a reality and will give me the opportunity to continue my work. 
In the New Year I will be showing The 52 Week Photo
Challenge in my private gallery. If you donate now to this campaign you will
get a special invitation to join me for some wine at this event. If you donate
even more I am offering myself and my services, to create with you, for you!
Each and every Challenge this year has taught me something
unexpected. Creativity is a process and inspiration comes from the most unpredictable
places. I learned that practice gets you one step closer to perfect and that a
little challenge can go a long way. I have realized that things don’t always go
according to plan but the possibility of something more beautiful may just come
of it. Pushing myself this year has increased my expertise as a photographer. Stepping
out of my comfort zone and trying new things made me realize that that is where
the magic happens. 
I challenge you to challenge yourself this year. What will
you do?

I know that sometimes it is difficult to find the funds to contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't still help out. Spread the word about my campaign by posting it on social media. Maybe one of your friends will see it and want to help out, and that connection would have never happened if it was not for you. I am also looking for help with my Challenges. This year I am going to need a big crew and we still have some holes to fill in. For example I am in need of a make up artist and a couple of interns!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Help in the emergency  /  Social goal
 

A new activity with multimedia tools 
 

First goal ! 

My first personal goal is to create multimedia videos and photos (in HD / 4K): to help discover, for example, the ancient restored farmhouse where I live and work, and other realities present in the large South Park of Milan (Italy): here you can find protected animal species, rare vegetation, monuments and places of historical interest.
This can be a good starting point for a Social Media Manager activity.
 
​
I have already started a initial business with videos and photos
 I started publishing some of my productions  on the Italian countryside  on
SHUTTERSTOCK  and  ADOBE STOCK  
 
Personal goal

  I would like to give this activity a better professional form  
So I would need funding for more professional photographic equipment; for advertising campaigns; and also for a small site that spreads my multimedia productions and that supports my social media marketing (SMM) activity.
I will start on May 18, 2020 a Social Media Marketing course with Marketing Genius

As I've grown older I've started to realized that I want to become a professional photographer. I spealize mostly in nature photography, constantly trying to capture on camera those moments in life most people never get a chance to stop and enjoy. Over the years I have managed to suprise people with photos that most would not have expected to be taken with the inexpensive point and shoot camera's I've owned, but I know if I want my dream to come true I will need professional equipment. This is where I'm going to need all the help I can get. Any little bit is appreciated, and will go a long way to reaching my goals.</p>

<h3><strong> </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Our Story</strong></h3>
<p>For women, aging brings with it an inner grace and beauty that is more than skin deep. From birth to old age, women transition through many physical, psychological, and emotional phases that are recorded on their faces.</p>
<p>Never before has a book so vividly projected the images of women in all stages of life in a way that reveals who they really are as women.  <em>Feminine Transitions: A Photographic Celebration of Natural Beauty</em> is a refreshing and inspiring, full-color book of photography. Its pages present a series of portraits that reveal the elegance and subtly honest beauty of female faces between the ages of 7 weeks and 105 years.</p>
<p>Author and photographer Alyscia Cunningham has truly unmasked the natural beauty of aging. “In a world filled with ‘Photoshopped’ images of women who are heavily made up, this book is a breath of fresh air,” says Trista Hendren, author of The Girl God and writer at the blog Elephant Journal.</p>
<p>The process of photographing the portraits for the book turned out to be a transition for Alyscia. “I simply wanted to put together a body of work that fosters a woman’s love for herself and encourages women to believe in their own beauty, despite the signs of aging,” says Alyscia.  “But as I looked through my lens, I couldn’t see the women. All I could see was their makeup.  Their masks.”</p>
<p>Alyscia then made the decision that all of her subjects remove their makeup for their portraits. That was when the book project really took shape. The importance of a woman’s “natural” beauty took center stage.</p>
<p><em>Feminine Transitions</em> unmasks women and exquisitely demonstrates that young is beautiful, old is beautiful, and natural is beautiful.</p>

<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>I am so proud and excited to produce my first photography book that is scheduled for release in <strong>March 2013, Women's History Month</strong>. I am also coordinating traveling exhibitions showcasing the images from my book. With your help and contributions, I hope to be able to raise the money for my shows and book production. The funds will be used for printing the first 500 copies of my book, rental space, framing, invitations, marketing, installation and all of the other things that go along with launching major solo exhibitions. </p>
<p>If I do not reach my entire goal on this round, I will purchase 100 copies using Blurb to publish. However, Blurb's prices are far higher than going to a traditional printer. Nonetheless, have a few copies in hand will be beneficial as people would rather see a product in hand.  From there, I will continue to collect the funds until I reach my goal by holding future funding campaigns. I've also submitted applications via my local arts organizations for grants and currently awaiting the status. </p>
<p>For your generous contribution, you will receive signed and personalized copies of Feminine Transitions along with recognition in the book’s marketing materials, which will be distributed to hundreds of media outlets. Higher-level sponsors can take advantage of tickets to the Feminine Transitions book launch party, prominent logo placements and even a full photography session from Alyscia Cunningham Photography.</p>
<p>In order to spread this important message of self-confidence to communities around the country, this project relies on support from individuals and organizations like yours. Please help make an impact and be part of this global movement by supporting Feminine Transitions at one of the perk levels. To contribute or to find out more information, please don’t hesitate to contact me directly at AlysciaC@aol.com. Thank you for your consideration and your generosity.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>As a valued contributor of Feminine Transitions, you can play an essential role in helping thousands of girls and women love what they see in the mirror and feel more comfortable in their skin. Your donation will directly fund the book’s production and the Feminine Transitions exhibition, which is currently slated to appear in ten U.S. cities, including DC, CA, OH, IL, NY, NC, SC, TN, GA, AL and UT.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>Word of mouth goes such a long way.  Now a days, social media is the way of the future. In other words, you can really help to make this campaign successful by spreading the word.  Do you have Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Tumblr, LinkedIn...or even an email?  The biggest help you can give, other than making a financial contribution, is telling others.  Post it on any or your social media sites and send info for my campaign via email.</p>

<h2>Deutsche Fotografische Akademie - ""1000 Wirklichkeiten""</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Das Event</h3>
<p>Die Veranstaltung <i>1000 Wirklichkleiten</i> zum 100-jährigen Jubiläum der GDL/DFA im Haus der Photographie, Deichtorhallen Hamburg, vom 9.-13. Oktober 2019 wird einen Einblick in den Reichtum der Bilder und Ideen geben, die im Laufe eines Jahrhunderts auf dem Feld der künstlerischen Fotografie entwickelt wurden. Visionen für die Zukunft werden den Vorstellungen historischer fotografischer Positionen direkt gegenübergestellt. Es geht nicht um einen allumfassenden musealen Überblick auf die Werke von mehr als 150 Fotograf/Innen, sondern um die Sensibilisierung für die Ausdrucksformen des Mediums Fotografie zwischen Authentizität und Inszenierung, Abbild und Abstraktion, Dokument und Fiktion, Intuition und Konzept.</p>

Das Event
Die Veranstaltung 1000 Wirklichkleiten zum 100-jährigen Jubiläum der GDL/DFA im Haus der Photographie, Deichtorhallen Hamburg, vom 9.-13. Oktober 2019 wird einen Einblick in den Reichtum der Bilder und Ideen geben, die im Laufe eines Jahrhunderts auf dem Feld der künstlerischen Fotografie entwickelt wurden. Visionen für die Zukunft werden den Vorstellungen historischer fotografischer Positionen direkt gegenübergestellt. Es geht nicht um einen allumfassenden musealen Überblick auf die Werke von mehr als 150 Fotograf/Innen, sondern um die Sensibilisierung für die Ausdrucksformen des Mediums Fotografie zwischen Authentizität und Inszenierung, Abbild und Abstraktion, Dokument und Fiktion, Intuition und Konzept.
Andreas Gefeller,  Supervisions
Das breite Spektrum der fotografischen Positionen innerhalb der GDL/DFA wird mit mehreren pointierten Thesen strukturiert und behandelt die Sujets: Portraitfotografie, Dokumentation, Journalismus, Street Photography, subjektive und generative Fotografie, Abstraktion, inszenierte, konzeptuelle und experimentelle Fotografie.

<h3>My Grand Plan and What It'll Cost</h3>
<p>This photoshoot would be one of the most beautiful and ambitious things I've attempted to date.

<h3>The Impact</h3>

I don't drink anymore and I don't need much in the way of material goods, but making art would be the gift that would keep giving all year round for me.

How excited we have been by leaving our lands of birth (France) to the other side of the Earth into very <strong>new Cultures</strong>, encountering a great Character made of Steel, Pylade, a <strong>sailing boat</strong> ""who"" became our <strong>floating home</strong>, sailing and <strong>crossing seas</strong>, swimming and fishing in Wild Life amongst <strong>Sharks</strong>, Dolphins and Rays, battling <strong>storms and angry waters</strong>, living in many countries trying to make people's way of life part of ours.<br/><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/drakkarts/?hl=en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.instagram.com/drakkarts/?hl=en</a></p><p>The 4 of us are completely <strong>passionate</strong> with <strong>Art</strong>. All of them!<br/>We marvel at them, they give us so much vibrations.<br/>Our own creativity goes through Landscape <strong>Photography</strong>, Poetry, Literature, Drawing, Music, Acting but we also do like <strong>meeting Artists</strong> to understand and share their own creations. It helps us to open our minds and grow inspiration.</p><p>Regarding <strong>Photography</strong>, do not hesitate to visit our profiles on <strong>links</strong> below, you will see a short selection of our work (you can even chose the platform you usually use):<br/><a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/150835808@N06/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.flickr.com/photos/150835808@N06/</a><br/><a href=""http://yourshot.nationalgeographic.com/profile/1438084/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://yourshot.nationalgeographic.com/profile/1438084/</a><br/><a href=""https://youpic.com/photographer/drakkArts/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://youpic.com/photographer/drakkArts/</a><br/><a href=""https://500px.com/drakkartsadventures"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://500px.com/drakkartsadventures</a></p><p>Our <strong>Family Life</strong> is made of steps built on unusual <strong>Challenges</strong>.

That very basic and rough <strong>travel mode</strong> will also help us to dig deeper in <strong>Philosophy</strong> and <strong>self-understanding</strong>.<br/><strong>Photography</strong> will report well-known vistas but captured through our own Creativity, as well as <strong>previously unseen</strong> ones intended to amaze people's stares <strong>with magic light and colours</strong>.

How excited we have been by leaving our lands of birth (France) to the other side of the Earth into very new Cultures, encountering a great Character made of Steel, Pylade, a sailing boat ""who"" became our floating home, sailing and crossing seas, swimming and fishing in Wild Life amongst Sharks, Dolphins and Rays, battling storms and angry waters, living in many countries trying to make people's way of life part of ours.https://www.instagram.com/drakkarts/?hl=enThe 4 of us are completely passionate with Art. All of them!We marvel at them, they give us so much vibrations.Our own creativity goes through Landscape Photography, Poetry, Literature, Drawing, Music, Acting but we also do like meeting Artists to understand and share their own creations. It helps us to open our minds and grow inspiration.Regarding Photography, do not hesitate to visit our profiles on links below, you will see a short selection of our work (you can even chose the platform you usually use):https://www.flickr.com/photos/150835808@N06/http://yourshot.nationalgeographic.com/profile/1438084/https://youpic.com/photographer/drakkArts/https://500px.com/drakkartsadventuresOur Family Life is made of steps built on unusual Challenges. It helps us to feel all the intensity of being alive and fulfill our thirst of Discovery. What's the next Discovery step?So the New Challenge is about joining Photography and Travel under the sole banner of the Travel Photographers.Travel will be shaped into a journey across our roots countries (Italy then Greece ... as a beginning!) riding bikes, stops for wild camping, hikes on spots. That very basic and rough travel mode will also help us to dig deeper in Philosophy and self-understanding.Photography will report well-known vistas but captured through our own Creativity, as well as previously unseen ones intended to amaze people's stares with magic light and colours. We also wish to report local high intensity scenes and Natives' uncommon portraits.If you wish to get a better idea of what is the whole project about and how we daily think and prepare it, just have a look at our YouTube Channel. Through short videos you will follow us into major topics related to our coming soon lifestyle: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8QJw3hwnW9ER6oaCRhf4yg Why this campaign?Across its whole History, Photography has always been tightly bound to Post-processing.Indeed, the Eye of the photographer is more than important. It precisely scans the scene, measures its whole intensity and places the difficult boundaries of the frame of interest.Then, come the photographer's skills regarding how to tune the camera to give the very first steps of creativity to the still-not-born photograph.Naturally, the shooting session begins and it is time for the Artist, sometimes surrounded by cold, wind, frost but very often magic ambiances, to refine tuning and slowly render the wanted (sometimes astonishing unwanted) picture.Now with their work stored in the can, it is time for Photographers to transform their work taken in the Field to a Piece of Art. It is when Post-processing takes place.Before the digital photography era, Artists would express their essence, imagination, creativity, dreams in Dark rooms, expertly manipulating their printings in developing bath until they would find the scene they were looking for.With the digital process, nothing has changed but the tools. Adobe calls one of its major photographer's tools Lightroom as an opposition, but also recognition, of the so dear Dark rooms. Obviously, tools as Photoshop-like software are also more than requested.Those heavy, useful and unavoidable applications need a strong and efficient platform in term of computer. It is at last the reason of our Campaign. What your contribution would bring?Today, because we are in an in between period and are not on our Nomad way, we use a big and heavy desktop platform to let us take off in our creativity voyages and render our Pieces of Art.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>100 years after the Armistice, the <a href=""https://www.vimyfoundation.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Vimy Foundation</a> is actively working to ensure that the stories of the First World War live on for generations.</p>
<p>One part of our work is our <a href=""https://www.vimyfoundation.ca/projects/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">First World War in Colour</a> project, aimed at re-engaging young Canadians in a defining moment in our history. The First World War was a transformative experience for Canada and while the memory of the conflict and its impacts on our collective consciousness are slowly vanishing, these photos capture our attention. They provide us with a clearer understanding of what the First World War would have looked like to the people who lived it.</p>
<p>We have so far been able to colourize 150 photographs from the First World War, which feature in our travelling exhibition <i>The Great War in Colour</i> and our new book <a href=""https://www.vimyfoundation.ca/projects/book-they-fought-in-colour/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>They Fought in Colour</i></a>.</p>
<p>We are ready to begin the second phase of the project: ""Canada at Peace."" This next phase will allow us to colourize a new selection of photos, highlighting lives of Canadians in the post-war years and helping us share their stories.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As a senior college student I have spent the last four years focusing on my work, I have chased the dream that everyone always told me to. I have caught the dream and the costs of tuition,  living, along with fees incurred at every stop along the way to getting my Bachelors Degree have caught me. </p>
<p>You will also be spreading my work, by donating you will recieve a piece of original artwork that you can display and show to family and friends. The feeling of your work being shared is one that cannot be explained in words. The feeling is incredible. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Don't worry if you can't afford a donation, I understand but perhaps you can pass this campaign along to your friends, and family. </p>

As a senior college student I have spent the last four years focusing on my work, I have chased the dream that everyone always told me to. I have caught the dream and the costs of tuition,  living, along with fees incurred at every stop along the way to getting my Bachelors Degree have caught me. 
You will also be spreading my work, by donating you will recieve a piece of original artwork that you can display and show to family and friends. The feeling of your work being shared is one that cannot be explained in words. The feeling is incredible. 


Other Ways You Can Help
Don't worry if you can't afford a donation, I understand but perhaps you can pass this campaign along to your friends, and family. 
 
Thank you!
