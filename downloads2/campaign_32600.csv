They have been together since high school, 15 years later they're 30 years old and still standing strong. They have been engaged for years and now it's time we help them be able to afford their dream wedding. I've never known a love as great as the one they share. One with the ability to move everyone and everything around them. Since I was a little girl (now 24)  I've watch their love grow and grow. Over the years they have only become stronger. I'm envious of a love like the one they have and I only hope one day I will find it too. MIKE AND ERIKA have made me a believer. And to those of you who know them, I'm sure they have made you one too. And to those of you who don't trust me when I say this is THAT FAIRY-TALE TYPE LOVE. <br/><br/>Now about me, my name is Briana. I'm the sister of the I hope soon to be ""Groom."" <br/>I also consider Erika, my brothers fiance' my sister.  I wasn't blessed to have a sister but Erika did a great job filling in. I've know her for about 15 years and we are extremely close. She's an amazing woman and recently my niece Taliyah told my mom that Erika is always looking at wedding dresses and talking about the perfect wedding. Taliyah also said she hopes she will be able to be the flower girl and hopes that she doesn't grow to big by the time they get married. She said she doesn't know why her dad gave her mom a ring but there was no ""ball."" She's at that age where she's really into princesses and princes and happily ever after. I don't want her to grow up and think those things are only for story-telling. Let's show her fairy tales do exist and let's help her and my two nephews be a part of one! Happily ever after can come true and I want to gather everyone I possibly can to make sure it does! Today I asked my brother ""why haven't you gotten married, you've been engaged for years?"" His response was ""she wants a big wedding, I want to make that happen but I can't afford it yet. Not with all my medical bills."" That broke my heart. If I only I were rich, I thought...But then I came up with a better idea, I don't have to sit around and wish I was rich enough to help them. I can take action, this is for LOVE, help be a part of making this fairy tale ending come true! You don't have to know my brother Mike or Erika, support LOVE. True love is so rare, help be apart of it. They have showed me that true love really can conquer all. Mike and Erika, you've made me and so many around you a believer! <br/><p></p>

I am a loving, kind and passionate young woman who dreams of making a positive contribution to the world through teaching.

I have completed 1 year of Spanish, but am still in need of a 2<sup>nd</sup> year. That is where you come in.</p>
<p>This June, I will be traveling to Salamanca, Spain for 3 weeks with students from the Napa Valley College to study Spanish at the Pontifical University. I will be studying Spanish 4 hours a day, 5 days a week at the University, where I hope to further my understanding of the language, as well as develop an ability to effectively communicate with others while speaking it.</p>
<p>By attending this study-abroad trip, I will not only be able to receive the credit I need in order to attend college this fall, but I will have the opportunity to  participate in a spiritual, emotional and incredibly educational experience. As I pursue my dream of becoming a teacher, it is my hope that I will be able to offer my students the memories of my personal experiences as I encourage them to embark upon their own. Your financial support will enable this dream to become a reality.</p>
<p>I need your help to raise $3,000. This sum will cover the entire cost of the trip, including food, homestay accommodations, airfare, and land travel. Your financial support will not go unnoticed: for your $25.00 donation, I will recognize you in my online blog that I will update while on the trip. For your $50.00 donation,  you will be recognized in a follow-up article that I hope to publish in the local newspaper.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>For much of my teenage and young adult years I took a wide and wayward path. I lived for myself and that's all I cared about. That all changed in 2006 when I lost my mother to Melanoma. I vowed then to retake my life and direct it towards some kind of redemption. A purpose. A legacy. Something I can give or do that would provide sustenance or positive influence to my family and those I leave behind. It has been an uphill struggle to repair over a decade of damage done and I've come so far though I have reached a plateau. I can go no farther in my (current) career in computer based technologies without earning the certificates that prove I am capable, and trained. Unable to provide anything proper for my child and family without robbing from one bill to cover the rest, and a promise made long ago to never stop pushing for the many instead of the one, I have decided to seek help from friends, family, and heck even a stranger or two to get the ball rolling. Instead of initially taking the long road through 4+ years in college (not to mention the $10K's), I have found a training and certification course that can be completed in 70 hours, a jump start for continuing my education in the future. For, just a couple of dollars from many sources keeps the train moving towards a better life for all in my life whom I have owed so much.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am seeking $2000 to enroll in the CompTIA A+ 70 hour course at CPCC.</p>
<p>I plan to tithe 10% of any money raised with the remainder going straight to supplies, books, and the course itself. If by some chance I do not reach the goal as stated I plan to take every ""extra"" penny I can earn while currently employed in the field until I have enough to enroll. My biggest downfall is the course begins in September and I already live paycheck to paycheck making ends meet.</p>
<p>The only thing I can offer in return at this point is a guaranteed completion at the top of the class and free computer assistance to anyone who believes in me enough to donate.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As I am already employed working in the field I have many avenues for advancement with my certs in hand. I envision the ability to become more of who I long to be with every step. This one step will literally double my hourly wage before the end of this year.</p>
</div>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you feel lead to do so, please forward and share this with anyone you think may have a dollar, or two, to spare.</p>

<p>Correct Me If I’m Wrong™ is a new twist on dry erase activity games that will change the way ""write and wipe"" activities are played. We are introducing Flip 'n' Check™. It is a special system invented by the famous toy and game inventor, Dr. Wexler. Once a game is completed, the answers are revealed when the activity sheet is flipped over. The answers line up with the players' answers and mistakes are easily wiped away. The system also ensures that there is only one solution for every activity. Simply put, Flip 'n' Check™ allows children to check their own work immediately after finishing an activity sheet. Because the activity sheets are not written on directly, they can be passed on from one child to another as brand new, and therefore any number of children can play. Not only does Correct Me If I’m Wrong™ consist of mazes, connect the dots, word searches, crosswords and classic, two-player paper-and-pencil games, it also has ""Story Time"", ""Three of a Kind"", and ""How Many?"". Every activity is beautifully designed and carefully conceived for age appropriateness. The games are suitable for children ages 5 and up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>TESTING </strong></p>
<p>We conducted various focus groups to evaluate our product's age appropriateness, usability, durability, educational value and fun factor. The first round of testing began with our own team, friends and family members and we found that the adults loved the concept and the fun and education it provided. Next, we invited a handful of NYC elementary school teachers to try our product and comment on its age appropriateness and educational value. Finally, we took our rough prototypes to a handful of NYC elementary school classrooms, an after-school program and a summer camp. We found that the children thoroughly loved playing with our activity games! Their enthusiasm for our prototype, which didn’t even contain final artwork or packaging, can only mean they will be more than pleased with our final product.</p>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP</strong></p>
<p>The not-for-profit organization, Teen Entrepreneur Boot Camp is the program responsible for this program that gives teens a hands-on experience with entrepreneurship through the process of launching a real game or toy into the marketplace. All profits from the sales of the game will go back into supporting similar programs like this one. We are about to release our first product,Correct Me If I’m Wrong™, thanks to the help of many professionals who donated their time, advice and pro bono services. Dr. Wexler not only donated his invention to our company, but also loaned us the money to hire a professional graphic artist to create the artwork for our game. We received pro bono services from a highly regarded law firm to obtain trademarks and copyrights for our product and from a public relations firm, services to build our website. In addition, we received advice from toy store owners and managers, sales representatives, lawyers, and marketing executives and received special permission to attend the 2011 and 2012 International Toy Fair. (Normally, no one under 18 is allowed to attend.)</p>
<p><strong>We are turning to Indiegogo</strong> to cover our final costs--manufacturing, toy testing, insurance, distribution, and marketing. Specifically, marketing includes maintenance of social media outlets, and distribution includes e-store management.

<p> </p></div>","OUR PRODUCT 
Correct Me If I’m Wrong™ is a new twist on dry erase activity games that will change the way ""write and wipe"" activities are played. We are introducing Flip 'n' Check™. It is a special system invented by the famous toy and game inventor, Dr. Wexler. Once a game is completed, the answers are revealed when the activity sheet is flipped over. The answers line up with the players' answers and mistakes are easily wiped away. The system also ensures that there is only one solution for every activity. Simply put, Flip 'n' Check™ allows children to check their own work immediately after finishing an activity sheet. Because the activity sheets are not written on directly, they can be passed on from one child to another as brand new, and therefore any number of children can play. Not only does Correct Me If I’m Wrong™ consist of mazes, connect the dots, word searches, crosswords and classic, two-player paper-and-pencil games, it also has ""Story Time"", ""Three of a Kind"", and ""How Many?"". Every activity is beautifully designed and carefully conceived for age appropriateness. The games are suitable for children ages 5 and up.
 
TESTING 
We conducted various focus groups to evaluate our product's age appropriateness, usability, durability, educational value and fun factor. The first round of testing began with our own team, friends and family members and we found that the adults loved the concept and the fun and education it provided. Next, we invited a handful of NYC elementary school teachers to try our product and comment on its age appropriateness and educational value. Finally, we took our rough prototypes to a handful of NYC elementary school classrooms, an after-school program and a summer camp. We found that the children thoroughly loved playing with our activity games! Their enthusiasm for our prototype, which didn’t even contain final artwork or packaging, can only mean they will be more than pleased with our final product.

WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP
The not-for-profit organization, Teen Entrepreneur Boot Camp is the program responsible for this program that gives teens a hands-on experience with entrepreneurship through the process of launching a real game or toy into the marketplace. All profits from the sales of the game will go back into supporting similar programs like this one. We are about to release our first product,Correct Me If I’m Wrong™, thanks to the help of many professionals who donated their time, advice and pro bono services. Dr. Wexler not only donated his invention to our company, but also loaned us the money to hire a professional graphic artist to create the artwork for our game.

<h2>Eileen's Story</h2>
<p>We first met Eileen a couple years ago when she was a high school freshman.  During a time when The Supply was just starting off and in need of financial assistance, Eileen stepped up and delivered us a check for $200.  We were blown away by her generosity and promised her that this seed would be planted and would grow to something amazing. </p>
<p>She ended up starting a chapter at her high school, where she became one of our most active high school fundraisers and supporters.  She led her school to raise over $2,000 last year and because of her avid support, we asked her to speak at our 2012 gala event in NYC.  Her passion and generosity inspired the older audience to give.</p>
<p>Eileen is approaching her senior year now.  A week ago, Eileen just came back from the Lenana slums as part of this year's High School Immersion Program.  After spending time in the community, living and breathing The Supply's work, her passion was solidified. She emailed us wanting to do more.</p>
<h2><strong>Eileen's Call to Action</strong></h2>
<p>Eileen spent this summer working hard to save money.  She thought of all the things she could do and the places she could go with the hard-earned money.  However, with the $3,000 she has saved, she wants to challenge and inspire others to take up a call to action.  She is matching dollar-for-dollar up to $3,000. That's right, $3,000.  </p>
<h2><strong>How it Works</strong></h2>
<p>Simple! If you donate $1, it's equivalent to $2.  If you donate $100, it's $200!  A generous high school senior is matching your funds dollar for dollar from money earned from her summer job! Crazy!</p>
<h2><strong>Where the Funds will be Going</strong></h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>50% of the funds will be going to a more secure roof for the Jumba Lenana Academy (secondary school in Lenana) and 50% of the funds will be going to our second secondary school build in the Matopeni slums (150,000 residents and no community secondary school).  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>Eileen's $200 donation has grown exponentially in the past two years.  For The Supply, we have been able to grow as an organization and do impactful work out in the slums of Nairobi.  Through your donation, we will be able to continue to educate and empower the next wave of local leaders in these urban slums.  On the other hand, Eileen, who has been along with us through the entire process, is now able to stretch her $200 donation to a $3,000 committment.  </p>

I’m Steven Davis and this is my son Matthew, 16years old. Handsome young man! Help him get his first car. Wait, wait, wait, keep reading!! It will brighten your day to know all is not lost on our next generation, and might even make you a bit proud. I’ve tried to teach Matt, and all my children, the value of hard work, responsibility, and earning what you get. Something that is not very common in this instant gratification and self entitled society of today. He has learned these ethics better than I could have ever hoped! <br style=""line-height: 19px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;""/><br style=""line-height: 19px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;""/><br style=""line-height: 19px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;""/>Matthew got his first job this year. I got him enrolled in a program that teaches young people good work ethics and he started working for an apartment complex. He has spent five days a week, 8 hours a day, all summer long getting up at 6 A.M. to go to work. He works outside in more than 100 degree heat mowing, painting, and moving stuff. Basically, stuff no one else wants to do. He even helped build a playground for the children in the complex last week. The man that installs them saw him working and asked if he could help him put in the new playground after his regular job. Matthew worked two jobs at this point. On the last day of the playground job I dropped him off early in the morning and there was a pile of wood chips taller than the slide. We of course laughed and I kidded him about the size of the pile, and told him good luck. To my amazement, when I came back at 3:00 in the afternoon, the pile was gone and there was Matt with a rake finishing leveling the wood chips in a 100’x 50’by one foot deep playground basin. It was over 105 degrees that day.

</div></div>","Hi people out there! I’m Steven Davis and this is my son Matthew, 16years old. Handsome young man! Help him get his first car. Wait, wait, wait, keep reading!! It will brighten your day to know all is not lost on our next generation, and might even make you a bit proud. I’ve tried to teach Matt, and all my children, the value of hard work, responsibility, and earning what you get. Something that is not very common in this instant gratification and self entitled society of today. He has learned these ethics better than I could have ever hoped! Matthew got his first job this year. I got him enrolled in a program that teaches young people good work ethics and he started working for an apartment complex. He has spent five days a week, 8 hours a day, all summer long getting up at 6 A.M. to go to work. He works outside in more than 100 degree heat mowing, painting, and moving stuff. Basically, stuff no one else wants to do. He even helped build a playground for the children in the complex last week. The man that installs them saw him working and asked if he could help him put in the new playground after his regular job. Matthew worked two jobs at this point. On the last day of the playground job I dropped him off early in the morning and there was a pile of wood chips taller than the slide. We of course laughed and I kidded him about the size of the pile, and told him good luck. To my amazement, when I came back at 3:00 in the afternoon, the pile was gone and there was Matt with a rake finishing leveling the wood chips in a 100’x 50’by one foot deep playground basin. It was over 105 degrees that day. His boss ,who travels all over the country installing custom playgrounds, told me he had never had a harder worker and ask if Matt could work for him the next summer and offered him a job when he graduates. This is just one example of how hard Matt has worked for what he wants. It’s what made me realize, what kid these days does this, what kid really works that hard, and what I had to do for him. Matthew has worked harder than most adults I know. Still, he does his chores at home with a laugh and a smile. He has never complained! Never has a bad attitude even when he is worn out. Most evenings he falls asleep at 8 or 9 P.M. He has saved more than 1000$ on his own, and would be happy with anything he gets. He has earned something to be proud of, and more than we can give.I’m asking all of you out there for help.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I teach 6th and 7th grade Science at a Title 1 (Economically Disadvantaged) Middle school in Fort Worth, Texas. Most of my students come to me believing they will never be able to break out of the ""hood."" By the time they leave me, most are planning to go on to college, many planning to pursue careers in science. Unfortunately, my district has not provided any supplies for experiments in three years.  I spend an average of $2,000 out of pocket so that my students can actually experience science and not just read about it. In order to afford this, I maintain a second job as a wedding DJ on weekends. I actually use this activity as well; I dj our school dances (free of charge, of course).</p>
<p>This year is going to be an exciting year for my students. Due to our budget issues, many of our investigations are outdoors, environment-based. There is a park and creek two blocks from our school. Last year, students identified coliform in the water. Coliform is a bacteria found in mammal feces. By working upstream with testing, students were able to identify two sources of the coliform, and wrote letters to the Mayor. As a result, the parks department is going to add a wetlands area to filter the creek water, which feeds into the Trinity River, the source of our drinking water.</p>
<p>After a meeting with the parks department, we have agreed that the students are going to help with this remodel project, providing labor and working side by side with Master Naturalists and the Parks Environmental department, freeing up funds for additional park amenities. My students are going to monitor water quality above and below the wetlands to determine the effecctiveness of this project. Students will also conduct periodic park cleanups.</p>
<p>I have taken a group of students many consider throw aways, and instilled them with a desire to learn and a desire to make a difference in their community. When my students wrote the Mayor, they were telling her, ""This is our community. We want to be involved."" These were their words!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our school has 24 computers to serve 550 students, making research for projects almost impossible. Even when I can schedule time in the computer lab, each of my classes has 30+ students, forcing students to double up on computers. Most of my students do not have computers at home, so all work has to be done at school. Our wish list includes:</p>
<p>30 netbooks to conduct research in the classroom.</p>
<p>10 digital cameras to record project progress, prepare science fair projects, and for field investigations.</p>
<p>10 Discover Scopes. These are field microscopes which will help students monitor health of the wetlands area.</p>
<p>All items will be used weekly throughout the year, and will be shared with other classes when we are not using them. All 550 students in the school will benefit from this campaign.</p>
<p>For your support, students will send regular updates on our activities, pictures of students conducting investigations, and a digital copy of project results.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I teach my students that, with the digital age, they can have an impact beyond the few blocks around their houses. I also help them understand that education is the most effective tool to break the cycles of drugs, alcohol, and gangs. My discussions with students go beyond the classroom, and we do get very real. I am working to prepare them to be better citizens of the world, to be successful-not defined by money, but by accomplishments, to appreciate the outdoor environment, and to understand we can all have a hand in taking care of the world around us.</p>
<p>When I first started teaching, after 25 years in the business world, I had a student who did exceptionally well on the state test. I told him i was proud of him. He stared at me a couple minutes, then told me no one, not even his parents, have ever said they were proud of him. After moving on to high school, many of my students come back to visit, and tell me I am the reason they stayed in school. Even so, I want to push these students to even higher levels. With your support, I can do this!</p>
</div>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

Email me at <a href=""mailto:Michael.sanderson@fwisd.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Michael.sanderson@fwisd.org</a>, and I will send you updates just for spreading word of our project.

<p align=""LEFT"">Cool shaded playgrounds, protected from the sun with shade structures, allow children to play outdoors longer. Our school is raising money, to buy shade structures for our playground so that children can enjoy more playtime outdoors.</p>
<p align=""LEFT"">Too much sun causes UV (ultraviolet) radiation exposure to your skin and can cause skin cancer. Become involved and raise funds for shade structures, so that children may enjoy a safe and healthy school environment.</p>
<p><strong><em></em></strong><em></em>The early brutal Texas heat this summer has convinced us of the need to install a large shade over the north playground to allow the children more outside playing time while being protected from the sun. </p>
<h3>Benefits of a Shade Structure</h3>
<p align=""LEFT"">Montessori School of Sugar Land is launching this new health promoting fundraiser for shade structures to protect our students from harmful UV rays of the sun. This shade structure is to be installed over the playground making it possible to play longer and maximize use of the climber at the school. Most schools desire to install shade structures to protect their children, but up until now this has proven to be a challenge as limited resources have to be utilized elsewhere.</p>
<h3 align=""LEFT"">Sun safety Practice</h3>
<p align=""LEFT"">Montessori School of Sugar Land spearheads our community as a beacon of light in sun safety practices. Fundraising for shade is a responsible, health promoting initiative that will change the next generation of youth to be more sun safe and skin cancer conscious. According to statistics from the American Cancer Society, 1 out of every 5 children in the United States today will grow up to have some form of skin cancer. However, 90% of skin cancers are preventable by staying safe under shade outdoors. With these alarming facts, it is no wonder that school districts and communities have become passionate at providing shade for their schools to protect their children from the harsh UV rays of the sun.</p>

I am asking for the financial support of everyone who is willing to assist in funding my two-year education at Columbia. With a Masters in Human Rights Studies I will continue to organize and work to establish policies that aid the community during this human rights violation crisis.  I would like to continue to work with Puente in order to build a sustainable movement that goes beyond defensive strategies to create autonomous spaces and programs that heal and empower our communities for generations to come.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>For over five years I have been with the Puente Movement, a grassroots organization that has been at the front lines fighting back against the anti-migrant climate that exists in Arizona.  The struggle in Arizona has taught me a lot about my education and how important it is that our society continues to raise young people of color who can access higher education while remaining deeply rooted in their communities. I have grown up in the struggle, completing my undergraduate tenure while witnessing the human rights violations perpetrated on my community by xenophobic law officials.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>During my tenure at Arizona State University, I was stripped away from scholarships and even work-study when organizing actions against pro-hate, anti-human rights politicians such as Joe Arpaio, Jan Brewer, and John McCain. This act was one that the university wanted to do for years, I was stripped away from the access to my funding as a way to attempt to silence me and suppress the student activism that was being birthed at ASU. The acts of “intimidation” nor the threats of several deans have not stopped me from both organizing against hate and for dignity and from attaining my education at ASU. Although I was successful in gaining a BA in History and two minors in Women &amp; Gender Studies and Justice Studies, I completed it with the accumulation of student loans.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Through my hard work and dedication, I can say I have the privilege of being accepted to Columbia University. Although this is a great accomplishment, I have several difficulties that await me when it comes to funding my education. Columbia University is a private, multi billion-dollar university. Because I am going for an MA (no PhD is offered), there is no way of receiving 100% tuition support from the university. I wish to complete my MA from Columbia with little to no debt because I want to return and continue being a community organizer, a non lucrative but rewarding calling with Puente, the organization that I have been with since day one.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please help contribute to my education at Columbia. Every dollar helps and is greatly appreciated. If you cannot provide financial support right now please think of me in the future and help now by sharing my story to others who can. </p>

Although this is a great accomplishment, I have several difficulties that await me when it comes to funding my education. Columbia University is a private, multi billion-dollar university. Because I am going for an MA (no PhD is offered), there is no way of receiving 100% tuition support from the university. I wish to complete my MA from Columbia with little to no debt because I want to return and continue being a community organizer, a non lucrative but rewarding calling with Puente, the organization that I have been with since day one.
 
Please help contribute to my education at Columbia. Every dollar helps and is greatly appreciated. If you cannot provide financial support right now please think of me in the future and help now by sharing my story to others who can. 
  
Thank you,

<h3></h3>
<p><b>Who are we?</b></p>
<p>We are parents. One doctor, a statistician, an artist, a horseback riding instructor. We believe in changing the world  -- one child at a time. We started with our own children. And we introduced them to a group of children a world away who live a different life. Together, they're figuring out how to help each other embrace and make better our shared planet. That's what The Bridge Project is all about.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>What will we do?</b></p>
<p>We are taking a ramshackle school near Accra, Ghana, that's bound together with broken boards, twine, rusty scrap metal and determination. We're covering the holes, nailing on a real roof, and creating a library strong enough to protect its precious donated books. We are rerouting the sewage that once ran through the dirt floor of this special school -- this hallowed dirty ground that has produced doctors and engineers. We are bringing computers, installing electricity and an internet connection so that the children can continue to share in each other's lives. Share friendships. Share teachers. Share music and hope. This is real change. One child at a time.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>When?</b></p>
<p>Constructioin of the library has already begun. Our crew of parents and children will spend the week of Thanksgiving in Ghana, working day and night alongside our Ghanaian friends. Our commitment to the school in ongoing.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>We need help!</b></p>
<p>This project is about more than a small group of American and Ghanaian children. It is intended to be a model. The world will be different. It will be better, when we focus on raising world changers. When children learn to look at the world, and their station in it, through broader eyes, exponential good will result. Please donate to our cause. We need money to buy school building supplies, to connect the electricity, and to install and support the school's internet access. We are taking a Wake Forest University-based film crew with us to document this phase of The Bridge Project in the hope of inspiring others. We also need help in covering the student film crew's basic travel expenses. </p>

<h2>Help Send Jack To School!</h2>
<h3>Hello! My name is Jack and I am an artist and yoga teacher living in Lexington, KY.</h3>
<p>I've been teaching yoga for three years and practicing for eight. When I first started practicing yoga I was overweight, unhealthy, had drug and alcohol problems and was very depressed. As I practiced my body awareness grew, and with that an awareness of what was and wasn't healthy in my life. I was able to change my diet and quit drinking, doing drugs and smoking and so I lost weight and saw great improvements in my physical health. Excercising everyday through yoga improved my mood, relieved stress and gave me time to focus and taught me discipline. After several years of rehabilitating my unhealthy body and focusing my scattered mind through yoga I was able to start excercising in earnest: I biked, solo, from San Francisco to Yosemite (a 500 mile round trip); I started running and became an avid hiker; I started rock climbing and now train so that I can continue to enjoy this dynamic sport; I have recently started working with bodyweight excercises and kettlebells and focusing on building strength; I continue to experiment with flexibility and mobility.</p>
<p><br/><strong>What all of this taught me is that MOVEMENT is the key to a happy and healthy life. Human beings evolved to understand and communicate with our world through movement, and without it we suffer terribly.</strong></p>
<p>Because I have a thirst to understand as well as to do, and I am passionate about teaching and sharing my knowlege I pushed myself as a yoga teacher to learn as much as I could about the human body and how it can move efficiently and healthily. <strong>At last I found a program at an amazing school</strong> that approached the body, excercise, health and training in a holistic manner that was in line with my philosophies and that I knew would push me with its rigorous scientifically-based academic program and highly qualified teaching staff. That school is the Lexington Healing Arts Academy where I will be enrolling in a 1 year/840 hour Personal Fitness Trainer program this Spring that will culminate with the National Academy of Sports Medicine exam to become a Certified Personal Trainer.</p>
<p>Wellness has become a burning passion for me because of my personal journey and the amazing opportunities I have had to witness my students make their own transformations. As I said earlier a healthy and happy life is dependant upon healthy movement. Becoming a Certified Personal Trainer will expand my knowlege to a huge degree and better enable me to help people move in a healthy and efficient way.<strong>It was not until I began to make myself healthy that I felt my life had meaning, and that meaning has translated for me as a feeling of being called to inspire others to health. I sincerely hope to be of greater service by taking this opportunity to learn and grow as a teacher and trainer.</strong></p>

<h3>Why am I asking for $6500?</h3>
<p>I have taken out federal loans to pay for the majority of my tuition ($8867.00 of $12500.00), but <strong>I still owe $3633.00</strong> to the school before the first day of classes on April 17th.  Additionally because my class schedule will be 9am to 1pm Monday through Friday, and I am told to expect 8-12 hours of homework a week, <strong>I will only be able to work part-time</strong> so that I can dedicate adequate time to my studies. Through teaching part time I will be able to cover rent, utilities, gas, car insurance, taxes and food. However there will be nothing left over if I have medical costs, am sick or need extra time to study and need to teach slightly less or have an unforseen financial need. As a student in the PFT program <strong>I am expected to dress appropriately and professionally</strong> (in other words, I need to be in workout clothes so that I can participate in excercises that we are learning and not the same pair of gross sweat pants that I workout at the climbing gym in). I believe $6500 will be sufficient to cover these financial needs.</p>
<p><strong>Your contributions will go to tuition, living expenses while I am in school and materials for school. </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>But what do you get?<br/></strong></h3>
<p>First of all you get another CERTIFIED and EDUCATED Personal Trainer in the world. <strong>Why does that matter?</strong> Because an uncertified and uneducated trainer is unsafe and ineffective. And if you live in the Lexington, KY area you're going to get access to one of the best, hardest working, most dedicated trainers interested in your whole health: ME!</p>
<p><br/>You also get <strong>the satisfaction of helping someone to realize their goals</strong> to educate themselves, be of service to others in a meaningful way and embark on a sustainable and rewarding career.</p>
<p><strong>But I've got some good stuff for you personally too!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Donate $25</strong> and you'll get an original piece of thank-you art (remember what I said at the top? I'm a yoga teacher AND an artist!). You'll also get my undying grattitude and if you're local, a big muscle-y hug next time i see you (hug offer not valid May through September, you know what it's like in Central Kentucky then!)</p>
<p><strong>Donate $50</strong> and I've got buckets of grattitude for you, a humidity-free hug and I'll make you an original piece of art BY REQUEST (you pick it, i'll draw it in magical jack style!)</p>
<p><strong>Donate $100 </strong>and you will be showered in grattitude, hugged until your eyes pop out of your skull, a piece of art by request and I will make you your own personal best workout mix CD IN THE WORLD!</p>
<p><strong>Donate $500 </strong>and you are in for such a treat! You'll be wallowing in grattitude, i'll be hugging you like winnie-the-pooh snuggling that honey pot, you'll be admiring your very own personally requested art (suitable for framing), rocking out to an amazeballs workout mix and then WE WILL WORKOUT because i'll give you a free training session once i've graduated and passed my certification exam!!!</p>
<p><strong>HEY BIG SPENDER! Donate $1000 </strong>and receive all the same perks as the $500 donation with this one big important addition: I MAKE DINNER. Are you thinking beans-n-franks? Mac-n-cheese? NO! We are talking Jack-dinner, that translates in English into things like: steak, bacon-wrapped sausages, grilled tuna steaks, massaged kale salads, roasted brussel sprouts, hand-cut sweet potatoe fries, crispy super-green fresh salads, mushroom rice, summer goat cheese quinoa salad, butternut squash and farro, baked apples, frozen banana cocoa ""ice cream,"" wheat-free PB&amp;J cookies. I will make a special menu just for you and we will spend some quality time at the gnome home eating these tasty treats. And yes, I can do vegetarian or vegan, too!</p>
<p><strong>The ""I love you Jack, but I'm broke!"" Gift:  </strong>Spread the word, friend! Share my campaign on Facebook, Twitter, your blog, through email, word of mouth or any other way you can think of! Indiegogo has lots of share tools you can use!</p>
<p>All of my successes in life have been largely depend upon the generosity of an amazing family and community of friends and supporters. So much of that generosity and support has been non-monetary, and that does not make it one iota less important or loving. I understand if you can't swing it, I appreciate any support you can give in any form. And I thank you for reading all this and for your positive thoughts and love!</p>

<p><strong><em>Who We</em> are...</strong></p>
<p>Our names are Leah and Olivia. We are two high school seniors at The Big Picture School in South Burlington, Vermont.  For our senior thesis project we want to travel to Ghana, West Africa and provide a creative outlet and positive curriculum for the students of a rural secondary school.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>The Trip</em></strong></p>
<p>We will be travelling to Hatsukope (Hatch-oo-cope-uh), a very small village in the Eastern Volta region of Ghana, West Africa. </p>
<p>Our hope for this trip is to create an equal learning experience for both of us, and the students.  One of our goals, along with preparing a stimulating curriculum, is to work together with the students and kids of the community to illustrate a mural.  The purpose of this mural is to give the students an attainable goal to  accomplish through their own ideas, cooperation, and imagination.  We will also be providing this opportunity for students at our high school in South Burlingon, Vermont.  Through this project, we will introduce a cultural connection of ideas between both communities. </p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>I was born in April of 1998 in Barcelona, Spain, and I currently still live on the outskirts of the city, with my parents and my older sister. I attend IES Can Puig, a state-run secondary education center (High School), where I'm studying the scientific baccalaureate. This means I study, on top of the obligatory subjects (Spanish, Catalan and English, Philosophy, P.E, and Modern Sciences), Biology, Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics. Although I enjoy most aspects of my student life, I'm never happier in school than when I'm in one of my science lessons. <br/></p>
<p>Last year I heard about an event held in London every year which brings together the next generation of young scientists aged between 17-21, and immerses them in the world of academia. The participants of this project are able to attend numerous science lectures held in the world-renowned Imperial College facilities, lectured by pioneering academics and surrounded by young adults with the same interests as themselves.  Not only would this forum teach me, it would serve as an incredibly solid foundation from which to build and pursue a career in science. <br/></p>
<p>I have from a very young age wanted to be involved in the world of science, and this forum would, on top of everything else, count as a very good experience on my application to universities. Although university is still a year away, I believe initiative is a hugely valuable asset. <br/></p>
<p>I'm appealing for a sum of £1500 which covers the cost of the forum. These expenses range from accommodation to food, lectures and transport. Any donation is greatly appreciated and will be met with one of the great Perks up for offer. I promise to give back to every donor  a token of gratitude, big or small. To check out more about these rewards please read on. <b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>PLEASE NOTE THAT ALL DONATIONS WILL BE SENT TO MY MOTHER'S PAY PAL ACCOUNT AS I AM UNDER AGE AND THEREFORE CANNOT HAVE MY OWN ACCOUNT.</b><br/></p>
<p>If the objective is not met, the money will still go towards the forum, and I'll  have to resort to some other alternative to get the rest of the quota. </p>
<p>It's quite hard to state exactly how much this project means to me; it's a key to open so many doors in the future, and my first step towards reaching my extremely high aspirations of being a world renowned surgeon. I am currently working on a bio-physical energy alternative with the hope of opening the mind of some creators and using the incredibly effective human body as the most effective machine known to man.  Attending LIYSF would give me the opportunity to meet some of the pioneering minds in my field of study and enable me to start putting my work in to practice. </p>
<p>If you cannot contribute to my project, please just spread the word and share it with your friends and loved ones. I'm incredibly motivated and dedicated to this project, and prepared to give 110% to reach my objectives. And, lastly, thank you for visiting my project and I hope to be sending you my Perks very soon!</p>

<p>The Makoto Dojo, School of Aikido, Inc. is seeking support for our <em>Strong Kids, Safe Kids</em> initiative.  This program provides training in physical and mental techniques of self defense, while promoting greater awareness of the potential for incidents of violence and their warning signs to children in the Ventura County/Southern California Community.  This new program will have an immediate positive impact on the safety and lives of children of our community by providing them with an effective means to defend themselves in a violent encounter.  In order to accomplish this goal, our organization has created a scholarship program that will make the training available to every child of the community regardless of their financial situation.  The program faces several challenges including the inability of individuals to pay for services, the need for additional instructors, additional equipment, existing equipment/facility maintenance and repair as well as additional class scheduling.  The program’s immediate impact and success is dependant upon these challenges being overcome.</p>
<p>We know that many of you simply cannot contribute money, but that does not mean you still cannot help.  We would appreciate it if you use the Indiegogo Share Tools and help us get the word out about our programs and the need for raising funds.  When is it going to be enough for you to make some noise about what kids these days have to deal with in the way of violence?  Now is the time to take action and help us to help more children!!</p>
<p>Incidents of violence and violent crimes are an increasingly undeniable problem in our society today.  According to a publication released by the Ventura Police Department “In 2011, our city had a 24% increase in violent crime…  There has also been a highly visible increase in criminal and anti-social behavior in some of the most visible public areas of our community.” Just recently in Aurora, Colorado 72 people were shot by a person just because he was angry; 12 of these people died.</p>
<p>Our organization’s mission is to provide vitally important physical and mental survival skills to students while strengthening their character through an emphasis on the foundation building blocks of kindness, compassion, honesty and integrity. Our Chief Instructor Larry Reynosa has more than 38 years of training and experience as a student and instructor in the martial art of Aikido.  He is one of the highest ranking instructors in the world and has provided training for law enforcement agencies, military agencies, private security agencies, colleges and hospitals throughout the world.</p>
<p>Since it’s founding, Makoto Dojo School of Aikido, Inc. has provided training specifically designed to serve children through <em>self-defense and assault prevention training.</em>  Through the Strong Kids, Safe Kids program, our organization will also seek to collaborate with local organizations and agencies involved with combating violence, <strong><em>bullying</em></strong> and domestic abuse.

</div></div>","The Makoto Dojo, School of Aikido, Inc. is seeking support for our Strong Kids, Safe Kids initiative.  This program provides training in physical and mental techniques of self defense, while promoting greater awareness of the potential for incidents of violence and their warning signs to children in the Ventura County/Southern California Community.  This new program will have an immediate positive impact on the safety and lives of children of our community by providing them with an effective means to defend themselves in a violent encounter.  In order to accomplish this goal, our organization has created a scholarship program that will make the training available to every child of the community regardless of their financial situation.  The program faces several challenges including the inability of individuals to pay for services, the need for additional instructors, additional equipment, existing equipment/facility maintenance and repair as well as additional class scheduling.  The program’s immediate impact and success is dependant upon these challenges being overcome.
We know that many of you simply cannot contribute money, but that does not mean you still cannot help.  We would appreciate it if you use the Indiegogo Share Tools and help us get the word out about our programs and the need for raising funds.  When is it going to be enough for you to make some noise about what kids these days have to deal with in the way of violence?  Now is the time to take action and help us to help more children!!
Incidents of violence and violent crimes are an increasingly undeniable problem in our society today.  According to a publication released by the Ventura Police Department “In 2011, our city had a 24% increase in violent crime…  There has also been a highly visible increase in criminal and anti-social behavior in some of the most visible public areas of our community.” Just recently in Aurora, Colorado 72 people were shot by a person just because he was angry; 12 of these people died.
Our organization’s mission is to provide vitally important physical and mental survival skills to students while strengthening their character through an emphasis on the foundation building blocks of kindness, compassion, honesty and integrity. Our Chief Instructor Larry Reynosa has more than 38 years of training and experience as a student and instructor in the martial art of Aikido.  He is one of the highest ranking instructors in the world and has provided training for law enforcement agencies, military agencies, private security agencies, colleges and hospitals throughout the world.
Since it’s founding, Makoto Dojo School of Aikido, Inc. has provided training specifically designed to serve children through self-defense and assault prevention training.  Through the Strong Kids, Safe Kids program, our organization will also seek to collaborate with local organizations and agencies involved with combating violence, bullying and domestic abuse. Makoto Dojo School of Aikido, Inc. currently serves approximately 400 students including men, women and children of the Ventura County Community and is an approved off-campus facility for students of Foothill Technology High School to earn P.E. credits.

Why Scholarobotics Academy?


Increase
scholars to prepare for a medical career                                           
Spark interest in
medical research focusing robotics 
Develop
professional experiences





The Scholarobotics Academy adds a dimension to learning that
is so unique because high school aged students are not just book learning, but
participating in a research project that examines a real world issue and its
possible solution.  Students are learning
how to conduct medical research and to present the material to healthcare
professionals in a professional manner. Additionally, academy participants are
immersed in medical terminology, medicine’s universal language and learn the
basics of suturing. 
Overview


The 2012 Academy participants
earn college credit in Medical Terminology. Scholars learned basic suturing
skills and honed their suturing utilizing the daVinci arm OR robot.  The
inaugural scholars presented the results of their individual research projects
at the 2012 RAMSES conference in Tampa, Florida.  The healthcare
professionals very well received the student presentations in attendance.

1996, and has since dedicated his energy toward improving the lives of the

<p><b>The Premise.</b></p>
<p>The rise of the smartphone has seen
our pocket-devices accomplishing <i>more </i>and <i>more </i>every day, and we
here at Jabbok see in this a huge potential to spark major and direct
improvements in the lives of the visually impaired!</p>
<p>As smartphones get <i>both</i> more
available <i>and </i>more versatile, we recognize the ability now for the visually impaired community to perform an increasing amount of previously
impossible tasks -- from getting e-books
read aloud to getting accurate live-descriptions of their surrounding world.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/843792/files/20140908180043-10.JPG?1410224443"" src="""" style=""width: 600.02px; height: 354px;""/></p>
<p>-----</p>
<p><b>The Task.</b></p>
<p>The iPhone is currently the
phone-of-choice for many of our visually impaired, largely due to the friendly
Accessibility functions (ie Text-to-Speech) integrated into its OS. We are excited
now to launch a project with the aim of putting smartphones into the hands of
visually impaired students across China, allowing them to access information
with unprecedented convenience and accuracy.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p><b>Progress.</b></p>
<p>In the first half of this year
alone, we’ve collected and refurbished iPhones and organized a social-service
trip to a disabled school in China. </p><p></p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/843807/files/20140908180439-26_teaching_c.jpg?1410224679"" src="""" style=""width: 575.18px; height: 381px;""/></p><p><br/></p><p>Taking a group of university students with

<p><b>Looking Forward.</b></p>
<p>We are looking for funding to
support the project and to fund its goals for the coming year of:</p>
<p>1. Obtaining and refurbishing
smartphones for distribution. (We take iPhone 4s and above).</p>
<p>2. Development, testing and
distribution of applications built for the visually impaired.</p>
<p>3. Organizing visits to schools for

<br/></div>","Hello!
Hello there! We are Jabbok
Charitable Foundation, a Hong Kong based charity organization that strives to
help the visually impaired community both in China and Hong Kong.
Working with the blind community is
a cause close to home for us. Our chairman, Edward Yip (葉炳釗), lost his eyesight in
1996, and has since dedicated his energy toward improving the lives of the
visually impaired. As a team, we focus on increasing daily accessibility for
the visually impaired, as well as facilitating their employment among different
communities.

------
The Premise.
The rise of the smartphone has seen
our pocket-devices accomplishing more and more every day, and we
here at Jabbok see in this a huge potential to spark major and direct
improvements in the lives of the visually impaired!
As smartphones get both more
available and more versatile, we recognize the ability now for the visually impaired community to perform an increasing amount of previously
impossible tasks -- from getting e-books
read aloud to getting accurate live-descriptions of their surrounding world.
-----
The Task.
The iPhone is currently the
phone-of-choice for many of our visually impaired, largely due to the friendly
Accessibility functions (ie Text-to-Speech) integrated into its OS. We are excited
now to launch a project with the aim of putting smartphones into the hands of
visually impaired students across China, allowing them to access information
with unprecedented convenience and accuracy.
-----
Progress.
In the first half of this year
alone, we’ve collected and refurbished iPhones and organized a social-service
trip to a disabled school in China. Taking a group of university students with
us, we taught the visually impaired students there how to maximise the use
their new smartphones to aid both their studies and their daily lives! -----
Looking Forward.
We are looking for funding to
support the project and to fund its goals for the coming year of:
1. Obtaining and refurbishing
smartphones for distribution. (We take iPhone 4s and above).
2. Development, testing and
distribution of applications built for the visually impaired.
3. Organizing visits to schools for
the disabled and educating teachers and students on the use of these
smartphones.We thank you for your kind support and donation as our backers. ----Collecting iPhonesIf you are considering to upgrade your old iPhone to the new iPhone 6 / 6 Plus, please donate it to us.  Passing it on to the hands of visually impaired students will allow them to read and study readily. We look forward to hear from you about donating your iPhone. Contact us at donation@jabbok.org.hk Let your iPhone to be used at its maximum potential!",5.0,1,"1 Campaign

database which records the biographies and bibliographies of women
writers and translators, who published poetry and fiction in the
German-speaking world between 1945 and 2008. Compared
to other literary databases and encyclopedias DaSinD online has two
benefits:</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">
</p><p>1)	It
records all
women writers in its designated time period with their works
regardless 	of financial success or literary fame.
That way an almost complete overview of 	literary works by women
writers is formed.</p>
<p>2)	The
available data can be searched and organized according to multiple
criteria 	chosen by the user.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">
</p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Who
uses DaSinD online?</b></p>
<p>DaSinD
online is a comprehensive work of reference for literary scholars,
linguists and historians as well as gender and social scientists. It
provides information for agencies, houses
of literature,
publishers, literary societies and clubs. DaSinD online is also
interesting for literature fans with questions concerning the women
writers “behind the books”.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By
now research libraries in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Spain, the
Netherlands, Belgium, the USA, Canada and Taiwan grant their users
access to DaSinD online.</p><p>While DaSinD online is currently only available in German our data is broken down into notes that can be easily translated with all current (online) dictionaries.</p>

<p>
The Stiftung
Frauen-Literatur-Forschung e.V. (Foundation Women's Literature
Research e.V.) was founded in 1986 as a charitable, non-profit and
non-governmental organization. Members and contributors provide
a small foundation for everyday items like office supplies for
example. The revenues of DaSinD online's user fees are used to award
short-term contracts for work.</p>
<p>
Simultaneously with its

publishes the Inter-Lit series of papers. This series consists of
monographs and anthologies about literary questions concerning the
role of women in literature and the positioning of women writers in

Every author is considered, regardless of her financial success or her literary fame. That way an almost complete overview of literary works by women writers is formed. Our database allows to comfortably link multiple questions and combine them into complex subject areas.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""></span><br/></p>

is DaSinD online?
DaSinD
online (short for “Datenbank
Schriftstellerinnen
in Deutschland,
Österreich, Schweiz 1945-2008“ or “Database Women Writers in
Germany, Austria, Switzerland 1945-2008“ in English) is an online
database which records the biographies and bibliographies of women
writers and translators, who published poetry and fiction in the
German-speaking world between 1945 and 2008. Compared
to other literary databases and encyclopedias DaSinD online has two
benefits:

1)	It
records all
women writers in its designated time period with their works
regardless 	of financial success or literary fame.
That way an almost complete overview of 	literary works by women
writers is formed.
2)	The
available data can be searched and organized according to multiple
criteria 	chosen by the user.

Who
uses DaSinD online?
DaSinD
online is a comprehensive work of reference for literary scholars,
linguists and historians as well as gender and social scientists. It
provides information for agencies, houses
of literature,
publishers, literary societies and clubs. DaSinD online is also
interesting for literature fans with questions concerning the women
writers “behind the books”.

By
now research libraries in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Spain, the
Netherlands, Belgium, the USA, Canada and Taiwan grant their users
access to DaSinD online.While DaSinD online is currently only available in German our data is broken down into notes that can be easily translated with all current (online) dictionaries.

What
is this about?
Currently
DaSinD online contains the different names, places and dates of birth
and death as well as the works of authors. However, in our internal work database a lot more biographical data has accumulated. The
difference in content is best shown in direct comparison:

For
special questions you have to contact us so we search our database
and then send the results to you. This is impractical and
time-consuming. We want you to be able to do your research yourself.
However because our database was largely created with the help of
semiskilled contributors the data needs to be professionally redacted
before it can be included in DaSinD online. For that we need your help.Goals and Stretch Goals for the Relaunch of DaSinD onlineIf we do not reach our goal any raised funds will be used to introduce as much new data into DaSinD online as possible.RewardsOther Ways You Can HelpEven if DaSinD online is not for you because you do not speak German, are not interested in the biographies of women writers or are currently low on funds you can still help by spreading the word.Who are we?

The Stiftung
Frauen-Literatur-Forschung e.V. (Foundation Women's Literature
Research e.V.) was founded in 1986 as a charitable, non-profit and
non-governmental organization. Members and contributors provide
a small foundation for everyday items like office supplies for
example. The revenues of DaSinD online's user fees are used to award
short-term contracts for work.

Simultaneously with its
work on DaSinD online the Stiftung Frauen-Literatur-Forschung e.V.
publishes the Inter-Lit series of papers. This series consists of
monographs and anthologies about literary questions concerning the
role of women in literature and the positioning of women writers in
the German-language literary scene.The Stiftung Frauen-Literatur-Forschung e.V. also hosts conventions, takes part in conferences at home and abroad and is interconnected with cultural and academic institutions.What
is so special about DaSinD online?Free online encyclopedias and the databases of special libraries or archives are using exclusion criteria like the reputation of the writers, the number of publications, the reaction of the media, the renown of the publisher etc. The data for DaSinD online on the other hand is collected purposefully and as broadly as possible at the same time, following scientific criteria. The goal is to record all women writers and their works. Every author is considered, regardless of her financial success or her literary fame. That way an almost complete overview of literary works by women writers is formed. Our database allows to comfortably link multiple questions and combine them into complex subject areas.

A
few examples of questions for papers that could be answered using the work database:



How
	many and which works were written
	by women writers in Low German during the last 10 years? (Master's
	thesis)


How
	many and which women writers were daughters of writers? (Query of a
	reader circle)


Which
	female journalists also considered themselves writers and published
	in the time between 1880 and 1950? (PhD
	thesis)


How
	are gender roles received and presented in the literature of
	German-language women writers? Which correlations between life and
	work of women writers can be recognized? (Project for an essay
	collection)

Memories
	of flight and displacement in post-war literature.
	A comparison of the witness generation and that of their
	grandchildren.
	(Master's thesis)

To
make the linking of searches available for all users the data has
to be redacted and introduced into DaSinD online. Since the database
was started in 1986 a huge amount of biographical data has been
accumulated in the internal biographical work
database:
More than 38.000 data sets.This
data is necessary to be able to assign the works to the right
authors. That is why the work
database
contains information about



Names


Dates
	of birth and death


Personal data
	(family relations and friendships)



	Education
	and career


Locations,
	events and activities of special biographic interest


Grants
	and
	awards


References
	of pictures or photographs (portraits of women writers)



In
DaSinD online however, there is so far only information on



Names
	– all occurring name forms and pseudonyms


Dates
	of birth and death


Places
	of birth and death

References
	of pictures or photographs (portraits of women writers)

Why can't the data simply be transferred from the work database to DaSinD online?Since 1986 only semiskilled contributors have added data to the work database. More than a hundred workers (volunteers or financed with subsidies of the Federal Employment Agency) and more than 71 interns have processed the data. The time people were working on the database ranged from 6 weeks, over 6 months to up to 2 years at most. That means that the team had a high turnover rate, which led to deviations in the data's consistency.For
an efficient research feature certain unifying criteria have to be
adhered to – that's why a redaction is necessary. For this we need
well-trained personnel that can focus on conducting the redaction and has to be paid.More questions?If you have any more questions feel free to contact us through our website, Facebook or Twitter.

</div></div>","For the past five years, students from the American University of Paris have been working with AJMJTO, an association for youth development in Ile Sainte Marie, Madagascar. In an effort to increase our contribution and create a long-term, self-sustainable income for the entire community on the island, a group of six from the university will travel there in August and establish a social entrepreneurship. AJMJTO has already raised funds to build a school for the students in Ilampy, who previously had to walk 7 km each way to get to school. Now they can enjoy an education, and we want to support the students in their endeavors by raising enough funds to provide the children with school supplements. Above all, our first step is to get funds to buy raincoats for the children for the rainy season. HELP US get the children raincoats! Estimated price to purchase one raincoat from the markets in Antananarivo for an Ilampy student is $5. A documentary will be released online at the end of our trip! Your contribution matters!


Depuis 5 ans maintenant, les élèves de l'Université Américaine de Paris travaillent avec l'Association des Jeunes Malgaches et des Jeunes de Toutes Origines, une association qui travaille pour le développement de la jeunesse sur l'ile Sainte Marie, au large des cotes de Madagascar. Afin d'augmenter notre contribution et créer un partenariat à long terme pour l'ensemble de la communauté sur l'ile, un groupe de six de l'université s'y rendra en Aout.

AJMJTO a pour but d’une part, de 
promouvoir le sport et d’autre part, de mener des actions visant à 
développer l’entraide entre les jeunes des pays riches et les jeunes 
issus des pays en voie de développement. L'année 2013 a été marquée par 
l'aboutissement du projet ""Une Ecole pour les Enfants d'Ilampy"" puisque les enfants devaient marcher 7km avant de rejoindre avant l'école la plus proche. Ilampy 
est un village situé sur l'ile Sainte Marie  Madagascar. L'école a été
 inauguré le 1er Octobre 2013, aujourd'hui plus de 140 enfants issus de 
familles défavorisées y sont dorénavant scolarisés. 

Notre première étape consiste à trouver des fonds pour acheter 140 k-ways aux 140 enfants de l'école pour la saison des pluies. AIDEZ NOUS à y arriver. L'estimation d'un k-way à Llampy coute environ 5 dollars. Un documentaire sera produit à la fin de notre voyage, Votre contribution COMPTE!!


 



Previous Work
AJMJTO, Association des Jeunes Malagesh et des Jeunes de Toutes Origines, 

 strives to create social initiatives for
disadvantaged communities, managed by local partners. Their
project ""Une Ecole pour les Enfants d'Ilampy »
on the Island Sainte Marie, which was inaugurated on  Octobre 1st, 
2013, has now more than 140 children from disadvantaged families that
have now access to education. Since then, the school has been fully operational, and they are 
currently installing solar panels to provide the school with sustainable
 electricity. The island is small but has more
than 27,000 inhabitants and lacks schools in terms of inhabitants.
AJMTO’s biggest oncoming projects include building a cafeteria for the children
so that they can get access to healthy food and accommodations for teachers who
live far away from the school.

Un projet de
 construire une cantine scolaire pour que les enfants puissent manger 
équilibré mais aussi des logements pour les enseignants qui habitent 
loin de l'école est en cours, si les moyens le permettent.

<p>Donations Welcomed!<br/>*If you can’t attend in person we will post the entire concert on our indigogo page.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>Liberia is currently ranked the
2nd most miserable place in the world to live.</p>
<p>The country’s unemployment
rate is more than 75-percent; illiteracy affects about 80% of the population
(70% of the entire population is under the age of 27). Additionally, about 80-percent of the
population lives on less than $1 a day.  </p>
<p>Carolyn High relies purely on
the support and donations of good Samaritans to provide education to this
depressed area. </p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Francis Jaway, the coordinator of this event, grew up in Africa and struggled through 5 years of the brutal Liberian civil war. This 14-year-long conflict ended up claiming the lives of several of his family members. He came to the US as a college student and eventually called LA his new home, but has kept his motherland close in his heart. With the help of fellow entertainers and the NoHo FUMC, he is hoping to raise funds that are desperately needed in a co-ed school that promotes global citizenship.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We understand that not everyone can afford to donate money, but if you live in the LA area please attend our free event. We just want to spread the word about this wonderful institution and the more folks we have there the merrier. If you don't live in SoCal, or can't attend the event, please share our indigogo page. </p>

Donations Welcomed!*If you can’t attend in person we will post the entire concert on our indigogo page.
  The Impact 

Liberia is currently ranked the
2nd most miserable place in the world to live.
The country’s unemployment
rate is more than 75-percent; illiteracy affects about 80% of the population
(70% of the entire population is under the age of 27). Additionally, about 80-percent of the
population lives on less than $1 a day.  
Carolyn High relies purely on
the support and donations of good Samaritans to provide education to this
depressed area. 
  Risks & Challenges Francis Jaway, the coordinator of this event, grew up in Africa and struggled through 5 years of the brutal Liberian civil war. This 14-year-long conflict ended up claiming the lives of several of his family members. He came to the US as a college student and eventually called LA his new home, but has kept his motherland close in his heart. With the help of fellow entertainers and the NoHo FUMC, he is hoping to raise funds that are desperately needed in a co-ed school that promotes global citizenship.
  Other Ways You Can Help We understand that not everyone can afford to donate money, but if you live in the LA area please attend our free event. We just want to spread the word about this wonderful institution and the more folks we have there the merrier. If you don't live in SoCal, or can't attend the event, please share our indigogo page.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>Hey there big world, my name is Ariel and I’ve got a passion
for women’s health! One year ago I decided to take that passion and make it
into a career by training to become a doula (childbirth assistant) and sex
health educator. It was not a natural choice when I already had a cushy desk
job with a solid paycheck; but after cradling a woman in my arms
near a shooting, I realized I was better fit to manage a crisis than a
computer. I traded that paycheck in for a sense of fulfillment when I decided to help educate women on their
reproductive path from adolescence into motherhood. I started this journey
with the kind words of support from my friends and have funded over half of the
total costs by myself, and now I realize that I can’t do this with
encouragement alone. </p>
<p>When people ask me “Why choose this field?” I tell them
about the 3 E’s: Education, Empowerment and Encouragement.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Education </i>- All women deserve to know about
their bodies from a credible source based on current evidence whether for legal
rights or available treatment options.</li>
<li>
<i>Empowerment </i>– When knowledge and resources are readily
available, women are able to confidently make informed decisions, find courage
to speak to their health care providers, and feel secure that they forged a
path that’s right for them. It’s a strength like no other!</li>
<li>
<i>Encouragement </i>– Sometimes you need more than a
coach, you need a friend. Someone to say they believe in you, that you are
strong, that you CAN do this! Whatever is right for you, I will support you to make it happen. </li>
</ul>
<p>Women all over the world deserve this treatment, so I plan to take this trade with me overseas to areas that have clinics in need and disaster zones where reproductive health services have been wiped out.<br/></p>
<p>While there isn’t an official degree for this dual role of sex health educator and doula, there are
certifications and trainings required and a fair amount of expense goes with them. I’ve
already completed and self-funded the heftiest courses; however, I've fallen on hard times and only have enough funds
left to complete either my DONA certification OR my international training in
Glastonbury, England. Without the necessary funds to complete my certifications
I cannot offer the full spectrum of services that women deserve. <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>How You Can Help<br/>
</h3> <p>By donating a few dollars, you're helping me complete an education that will literally be invested in our future as I escort women into motherhood. </p> <ul>
<li>$1000 for my UK birth doula course - I've already paid the $1600 for the class itself but need help to retain lodging, food and travel expenses.<br/>
</li> <li>$500 to complete my DONA certification here in the states - breastfeeding class, membership fee, application fee, required reading materials, etc.<br/>
</li> <li>$200 for marketing materials - brochures, website costs, business cards</li>
<li>$300 for courses yet to take like mama/baby massage, aromatherapy and essential oils for pregnancy, placenta encapsulation, CPR/first aid certification renewal, postpartum doula certification and prenatal/postpartum nutrition. $300 will not cover all of these courses, a couple at best, so any additional funds that exceed my goal will be invested in further education. <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Perks</h3> <p></p>
<p>Are you wondering what YOU get out
of donating to the cause? Well, helping to educate and create a well-rounded
doula could lead to YOU or someone you love having me in their corner when one

wiped out from natural disasters. <br/></p>
There are perks for $5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 donations so there's an amount for any sized pocketbook. **NOTE** If you donate anonymously I can't properly glomp or send you goodies, which is fine if you like to stay incognito but I just wanted you to know :)<br/><br/><p>Along the way I will be updating my <a href=""http://www.e3withme.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website </a>with my journey to complete my certifications so you can travel with me!<br/></p>

</div><p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p><p>The exact relationship of contemporary mindfulness practices to more traditional Buddhist psychological theories remains a complex and contested issue in various academic, clinical, religious, and popular contexts. Here you have the chance to contribute to the ongoing and in-depth exploration of this subject in theory and practice and also to receive future updates on this process in return. The goal of this campaign thus is to raise €3.868 for my participation in the Bodhi College's Mindfulness Teachers' Development Programme.  </p><p><b>BACKGROUND</b></p><p>My academic background actually is in Tibetan and
Buddhist Studies, and I have been working as an assistant librarian for the South
Asian, Tibetan and Buddhist Studies Library of the University of Vienna.
Besides this, I have also gathered substantial experience in translating texts from
Tibetan and Sanskrit, editing academic publications, and interpreting for Buddhist
teachers<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">.</span></p>
<p>As part of my continuing education, I have recently completed
a basic mindfulness training course and I am also undergoing preparatory psychotherapy
training, in the context of which I am currently on a six-month internship at the
Oxford Mindfulness Centre.</p>
<p>Here I have recently learned about a unique future training
opportunity which is essential in my path towards an engaged yet critical
integration of such diverse backgrounds and approaches – and it is in this case that I am asking
for your help.</p><p><b>THE CAMPAIGN</b></p>
<p></p><p><b>The Mindfulness Teachers’ Development Programme</b> (MTDP) is a newly established two-year extended course offered by the Bodhi
College. It explores the foundations of mindfulness in Buddhist psychology as
well as the ways in which these teachings inform contemporary mindfulness and thus
continue to be a pathway to emotional and psychological healing and

</div></div>","INTRODUCTIONThe exact relationship of contemporary mindfulness practices to more traditional Buddhist psychological theories remains a complex and contested issue in various academic, clinical, religious, and popular contexts. Here you have the chance to contribute to the ongoing and in-depth exploration of this subject in theory and practice and also to receive future updates on this process in return. The goal of this campaign thus is to raise €3.868 for my participation in the Bodhi College's Mindfulness Teachers' Development Programme.  BACKGROUNDMy academic background actually is in Tibetan and
Buddhist Studies, and I have been working as an assistant librarian for the South
Asian, Tibetan and Buddhist Studies Library of the University of Vienna.
Besides this, I have also gathered substantial experience in translating texts from
Tibetan and Sanskrit, editing academic publications, and interpreting for Buddhist
teachers.
As part of my continuing education, I have recently completed
a basic mindfulness training course and I am also undergoing preparatory psychotherapy
training, in the context of which I am currently on a six-month internship at the
Oxford Mindfulness Centre.
Here I have recently learned about a unique future training
opportunity which is essential in my path towards an engaged yet critical
integration of such diverse backgrounds and approaches – and it is in this case that I am asking
for your help.THE CAMPAIGN
The Mindfulness Teachers’ Development Programme (MTDP) is a newly established two-year extended course offered by the Bodhi
College. It explores the foundations of mindfulness in Buddhist psychology as
well as the ways in which these teachings inform contemporary mindfulness and thus
continue to be a pathway to emotional and psychological healing and
transformation. (See the link below on detailed information on the MTDP)Module 1, Contextualising Mindfulness, will explore the foundational texts that underpin all contemporary mindfulness-based interventions and what Buddhist psychology has to offer to contemporary mindfulness teaching. (CH, February 2016)Module 2, The Existential Challenge, looks at the three universal characteristics - distress, anguish, and struggle as
well as impermanence and non-self - and investigate the ways in which self perception and our world of experience
is constructed. (UK, October 2016) Module 3, The Big Picture, will look how the teachings on the aggregates and dependent arising offer effective conceptual maps to disclose the
complexity of what we call “experience"" as well as how they open up possibilities for insight and transformation. (CH, February 2017)Finally, Module 4, Universal Empathy, will explore the four boundless abodes - friendliness, compassion, joy and equanimity - and how these qualities are explicitly cultivated in
Buddhist meditative pathways and implicitly taught and developed in
contemporary mindfulness-based applications. (UK, October 2017)COSTSThe costs for the full programme spanning four modules
in the UK and Switzerland is €3.868 (£2.791). Additional costs include €762 (£550) for
accommodation and an estimated €800 (£577) for travel, amounting to
a grand total of approximately €5.430 (£3.918).
The goal of this campaign is to raise the full
programme costs of €3.868 (£2.791).Should that goal be reached before the end of the campaign, my plan is to stretch the goal to cover costs for
accommodation and travel as well. If we come up short of the intended goal, the accumulated amount will still go towards the programme costs and I will have to find other ways to finance the outstanding payments.Please note that the accrued costs for my preliminary mindfulness and psychotherapy training have exceeded €7.500 within the previous two years.WHY?This is a unique opportunity for me to continue and deepen my studies and
practice with an exceptionally innovative yet well-grounded group of teachers who
are at the forefront of combining traditional Buddhist teachings with a critical

Through my participation in this course, I will be

design <br/>5. colors <br/>6. production <br/>7. project timeline <br/>8. press <br/>9. risks and challenges</p><p><br/><b>1. introducing lini cube</b></p><p>Lini cube is a beautiful educational toy building block that enables you to be more creative than ever before.</p><p><br/><b>2. features</b></p><ul>
<li>
<b>variety</b><br/>There are 105 different ways you can plug a lini cube into another. It’s more than 11 times compared to a conventional building block. </li>
<li>
<b>sideplug</b><br/>You can use the sides to build. The conventional building blocks would only allow you to build on top. </li>
<li>
<b>upside down</b><br/>Build without defining a top, side or bottom. Make a bathtub, turn it around and let it be a table. </li>
<li>
<b>move</b>The move feature lets you have moving parts within your building. Build a couch that converts into a bed or a fence with gates that open and close. </li>
<li>
<b>add</b><br/>Add something to the side of a finished building like a stairway, bunk bed or a balcony without having to reassemble it. </li>
<li>
<b>3D puzzle</b>Create your own stunning 3D puzzles. Watch the demo. </li>
<li>
<b>hide</b><br/>Build items that complement each other as demonstrated in the features demo video.</li>
</ul><p><br/><b>3. educational</b></p><p>I had the chance to test the lini cube in three protectories. It was interesting to see how different children approach building. Some would just build in two dimensions even though they have the ability to build in any directions. Some would create awesome spatial buildings right from the start.</p><p>This showed me, that the lini cube is not just a great educational toy but also ideal to test or experiment on cognitive abilities like perception, attention, memory, learning, problem solving, creativity, planning, orientation, imagination…</p><p><br/><b>4. design</b></p><p>The design in every aspect had to be perfect. It is not easy to create a construction toy with all those features and still keep it beautiful. Even though there are infinite ways to create a pattern, I designed the pattern very carefully. </p><p>In the acoustics the sinus wave will create a harmonious sound. I tried to transfer this principle to the design of the lini cube. I used sinus curves to make the design feel harmonious. The intersection of horizontal and vertical sinus curves create the beautiful pattern. It looks like little pillows. </p><p>But design is more than just the look. It goes hand in hand with the technical feature. The pockets that are cut half on the edges will have a dovetail. This enables you to plug another cube onto the edge without falling off. Furthermore it’s lets you connect two building blocks with just one plug. </p><p>The pillow pockets have also another important feature. You can plug cylindric shapes and shapes with a square like footprint into the pockets. Cylinders have the ability to rotate and square like footprints are better for alignment and connecting two blocks.</p><p>This design approach also creates an extra shifted line with pockets which result in more plugging options. </p><p>Instead of having many single studs on the outside surface I connected them with each other. This prevents the surface from being bumpy and allows another object to slide along. </p><p><br/><b>5. colors</b></p><p>Colours are wonderful and something I dearly love. The toy industry sometimes gives me the impression to throw random colours at children. I wanted to give it the attention it deserves and came up with a new approach. I can’t wait to share it with you!</p><p>Nevertheless before we get to talk about colours we have to kick off production. So in this campaign I want to focus on presenting the features and uniqueness of the product as well as getting production started. </p><p>I can’t work on to many ends at the same time if I want to get it right. So I decided to separate it. If this campaign succeeds we can go a step further. </p><p>Therefor I thought about something special for everyone who supports me in this campaign. You will have the chance on getting a Limited Edition red color that will not be reproduced any time later. It's the red used for demonstration, the one you can see on the pictures and videos. </p><p><br/><b>6. production</b></p><p>The entire production will be Made in Germany. Prototyping, molds, production, packaging. Probably the most expensive part of this project are the molds. While in most cases this part will be contracted to Chinese companies to save extensive time and money, I decided to do this locally. There are three main reason for this: I don’t want to give construction files out of country. Second, it’s a toy for children and I want to be as close as possible to production. Third, even though it looks like a simple product it has to be produced with high precision and needs complex tooling. </p><p><br/><b>7. project timeline</b></p><ul>
<li>
<b>2014, April 09 - Idea </b><br/>The idea together with a certain determination was born on a Wednesday night, not knowing that months of hard work would follow. As I stumbled over a conventional building block that night many thoughts crossed my mind. On one hand I though about how awesome this company is and what brilliant idea (only later I learned, that it was initially invented by someone else). On the other hand I remembered my frustration as a child not being able to plug anything to the side. Nevertheless I had confidence a building block with this capability would soon appear. This never happened. At this very moment I knew, that if I don’t do something about it, I will even see my grandchildren play with building blocks from 1939 and struggle with the same limitations. A few minutes later I had a rough idea of how it could work, a few days later a rough 3D sketch of how it could look like.</li>
<li>
<b>2014, May - First Prototype </b><br/>First prototype with round plugs. Up to this point no one I dealt with thought it would work including the prototype builders. Now I had the proof and a few impressed faces. </li>
<li>
<b>2014, June - Second Prototype </b><br/>Second prototype with “pillow” plugs. </li>
<li>
<b>2014, September - Third Prototype</b><br/>Various colours and better quality</li>
<li>
<b>2014, Dezember - Patents Filing</b><br/>3 technical patents. Patents are a science in itself. I learned a lot. For the most ideal protection it was not enough to file one patent. </li>
<li>
<b>2015, January - Building Testings</b><br/>Had over a hundred prototypes made to test various models in real life conditions. Do to the small quantity of the prototypes I previously could just do simulations on a computer. Now I could make sure that models in my 3D renderings can actually be build. </li>
<li>
<b>2015, August - Sample Mold</b><br/>The sample mold was another challenge. The cube came out surprisingly well with still some tweaks to be done.</li>
<li>
<b>2015, October - Design Patent </b><br/>10 Designs registered</li>
<li>
<b>2015, October - Support</b><br/>1st Support from the German Economics Ministry (German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy).</li>
<li>
<b>2015, November - Production Mold</b><br/>The results from the production molds are great. Read for production. </li>
<li>
<b>2015, November - Support</b><br/>2nd Support from the German Economics Ministry (German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy).</li>
<li><b>2015, December - Kickstarter Launch</b></li>

varietyThere are 105 different ways you can plug a lini cube into another. It’s more than 11 times compared to a conventional building block. 

sideplugYou can use the sides to build. The conventional building blocks would only allow you to build on top. 

upside downBuild without defining a top, side or bottom. Make a bathtub, turn it around and let it be a table. 

moveThe move feature lets you have moving parts within your building. Build a couch that converts into a bed or a fence with gates that open and close. 

addAdd something to the side of a finished building like a stairway, bunk bed or a balcony without having to reassemble it. 

3D puzzleCreate your own stunning 3D puzzles. Watch the demo. 

hideBuild items that complement each other as demonstrated in the features demo video.
3. educationalI had the chance to test the lini cube in three protectories. It was interesting to see how different children approach building. Some would just build in two dimensions even though they have the ability to build in any directions. Some would create awesome spatial buildings right from the start.This showed me, that the lini cube is not just a great educational toy but also ideal to test or experiment on cognitive abilities like perception, attention, memory, learning, problem solving, creativity, planning, orientation, imagination…4. designThe design in every aspect had to be perfect. It is not easy to create a construction toy with all those features and still keep it beautiful. Even though there are infinite ways to create a pattern, I designed the pattern very carefully. In the acoustics the sinus wave will create a harmonious sound. I tried to transfer this principle to the design of the lini cube. I used sinus curves to make the design feel harmonious. The intersection of horizontal and vertical sinus curves create the beautiful pattern. It looks like little pillows. But design is more than just the look. It goes hand in hand with the technical feature. The pockets that are cut half on the edges will have a dovetail. This enables you to plug another cube onto the edge without falling off. Furthermore it’s lets you connect two building blocks with just one plug. The pillow pockets have also another important feature. You can plug cylindric shapes and shapes with a square like footprint into the pockets. Cylinders have the ability to rotate and square like footprints are better for alignment and connecting two blocks.This design approach also creates an extra shifted line with pockets which result in more plugging options. Instead of having many single studs on the outside surface I connected them with each other. This prevents the surface from being bumpy and allows another object to slide along. 5. colorsColours are wonderful and something I dearly love. The toy industry sometimes gives me the impression to throw random colours at children. I wanted to give it the attention it deserves and came up with a new approach. I can’t wait to share it with you!Nevertheless before we get to talk about colours we have to kick off production. So in this campaign I want to focus on presenting the features and uniqueness of the product as well as getting production started. I can’t work on to many ends at the same time if I want to get it right. So I decided to separate it. If this campaign succeeds we can go a step further. Therefor I thought about something special for everyone who supports me in this campaign. You will have the chance on getting a Limited Edition red color that will not be reproduced any time later. It's the red used for demonstration, the one you can see on the pictures and videos. 6. productionThe entire production will be Made in Germany. Prototyping, molds, production, packaging. Probably the most expensive part of this project are the molds. While in most cases this part will be contracted to Chinese companies to save extensive time and money, I decided to do this locally. There are three main reason for this: I don’t want to give construction files out of country. Second, it’s a toy for children and I want to be as close as possible to production. Third, even though it looks like a simple product it has to be produced with high precision and needs complex tooling. 7. project timeline

2014, April 09 - Idea The idea together with a certain determination was born on a Wednesday night, not knowing that months of hard work would follow. As I stumbled over a conventional building block that night many thoughts crossed my mind. On one hand I though about how awesome this company is and what brilliant idea (only later I learned, that it was initially invented by someone else). On the other hand I remembered my frustration as a child not being able to plug anything to the side. Nevertheless I had confidence a building block with this capability would soon appear. This never happened. At this very moment I knew, that if I don’t do something about it, I will even see my grandchildren play with building blocks from 1939 and struggle with the same limitations. A few minutes later I had a rough idea of how it could work, a few days later a rough 3D sketch of how it could look like.

2014, May - First Prototype First prototype with round plugs. Up to this point no one I dealt with thought it would work including the prototype builders. Now I had the proof and a few impressed faces. 

2014, June - Second Prototype Second prototype with “pillow” plugs. 

2014, September - Third PrototypeVarious colours and better quality

2014, Dezember - Patents Filing3 technical patents. Patents are a science in itself. I learned a lot. For the most ideal protection it was not enough to file one patent. 

2015, January - Building TestingsHad over a hundred prototypes made to test various models in real life conditions. Do to the small quantity of the prototypes I previously could just do simulations on a computer. Now I could make sure that models in my 3D renderings can actually be build. 

2015, August - Sample MoldThe sample mold was another challenge. The cube came out surprisingly well with still some tweaks to be done.

2015, October - Design Patent 10 Designs registered

</div><p>Seong-ho grew up during the devastating North Korean famine of the
1990s, where Kim Jong-il intentionally withheld food from province deemed
disloyal to the regime. Millions starved, and bodies littered the streets. In
order to survive, Seong-ho was forced to steal coal and sell it on the black
market in order to feed his family. While taking coal from a train car one
night, he lost consciousness and fell onto the tracks, losing his left hand and
foot when the train car ran over him. </p><p></p>
<p>After enduring a grueling amputation with no anesthesia, his
family nursed him back to health at their own expense. Even his brother became
stunted due to malnutrition. In North Korea, disabled people are routinely
treated as sub-human, and Seong-ho became an outcast. Despite
the odds, Seong-ho was determined to survive and make a life for himself. One
day he decided to escape North Korea, beginning an epic journey where he would
drag himself 6,000 miles on wooden crutches through China and the jungles of
southeast Asia all the way to Thailand. There, he was finally able to get on to
a plane to South Korea.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438819370/hc098cvcjje3xusulkrf.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<h3>Seong-ho's mission</h3><p>Though now living in a free and
open society today in Seoul, Seong-ho has never forgotten those he left
behind. To assist his friends and family trapped in North Korea's totalitarian
state, Seong-ho founded Now Action and Unity for Human Rights (NAUH), an
organization that saves refugees and broadcasts radio messages with truth,
culture, and knowledge into North Korea. Despite NAUH's limited resources,
over the last four years it has helped give freedom to more than 100 North
Korean women, children, and disabled people, and has broadcast thousands of
hours of radio programming into the country, sending messages of hope to those
trapped in the world's largest open-air prison.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438818117/atha2mtrqrzzenqcn2ot.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p><p>Today NAUH operates out of a single-room, 140 square foot, fifth floor walk-up in Seoul with no elevator. It holds Seong-ho's desk and not much else, making it very hard to conduct even routine office business, and making it nearly impossible to accommodate visitors and volunteers. What's more, the daily climb up dozens of stairs has become very painful for Seong-ho, who has developed inflammation on his left leg because of the physical stress on his prosthetic leg. His amputation in North Korea was not done using modern medical standards, and he often needs to visit a hospital for treatment.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438818061/ea1hzzyxnnlfyobgiwih.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>

<h3><b>Why
is the fundraising goal $51,353?</b></h3>
<p>The most basic necessity in Seong-ho's structure of needs is a home base. His tiny one-room office, with its daunting flight of stairs, is limiting his potential and taking a painful toll on his health. In order to save more lives and send more information into North Korea, Seong-ho needs a bigger and better headquarters. In South Korea's ""wolseh"" real estate system, a renter signs a lease for 1 or 2 years and makes a security
deposit on the space equal to as much as 10% of its market value. <a href=""http://blog.thearrivalstore.com/life-in-korea/korean-rent-apartment-in-korea/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Here
is a resource for learning more about the South Korean real estate system.</span></a> Seong-ho hopes to move into a new 1076 square foot office in Woo-il Town, located right in front of a metro station and equipped with two elevators and separate male and female bathrooms. The $51,353 fundraising goal will cover the $44,681 security deposit and first month's rent payment of $2,868 for this space, as well as the fees taken by IndieGoGo and its credit card processors.</p><p></p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438978901/ssbuq97g832zinjx5udu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3><b>Who is HRF?</b></h3>

Why donate todayThis mission is time-sensitive, because on September 17, Seong-ho and NAUH's current lease will expire. Donate now to help
HRF move Seong-ho into a handicapped-accessible office that will
not bring him physical harm and pain. This will
allow him and his staff to maximize their full potential in carrying out their
vital educational and rescue efforts. These programs provide information to the North Korean people so they can begin to choose for
themselves the kind of world in which they want to live. Please help
Seong-ho with the critical task of spreading information to those who
need it most.#HowFarWouldYouGo
Please help us share this initiative with your friends, family, and networks to spread the word. In the photo gallery, you'll see people from Cuba to Malaysia who have posed with crutches above their heads, just like Seong-ho did when he concluded his triumphant speech at the Oslo Freedom Forum. Post a picture of yourself with crutches above your head, along with the #HowFarWouldYouGo hashtag, to help the momentum going with this campaign.
Why
is the fundraising goal $51,353?
The most basic necessity in Seong-ho's structure of needs is a home base. His tiny one-room office, with its daunting flight of stairs, is limiting his potential and taking a painful toll on his health. In order to save more lives and send more information into North Korea, Seong-ho needs a bigger and better headquarters. In South Korea's ""wolseh"" real estate system, a renter signs a lease for 1 or 2 years and makes a security
deposit on the space equal to as much as 10% of its market value. Here
is a resource for learning more about the South Korean real estate system. Seong-ho hopes to move into a new 1076 square foot office in Woo-il Town, located right in front of a metro station and equipped with two elevators and separate male and female bathrooms. The $51,353 fundraising goal will cover the $44,681 security deposit and first month's rent payment of $2,868 for this space, as well as the fees taken by IndieGoGo and its credit card processors.Who is HRF?
The Human Rights Foundation is a human rights organization that protects and promotes
individual rights around the world where they are most at risk. Since 2009, HRF
has partnered with North Koreans who have risked their lives to escape this
tyranny that has caused so much suffering. Together, we support the
dissemination of information into North Korea by land, air, and radio.
These
defector groups are inadequately funded, but passionately devoted to the cause
of a free and democratic North Korea. They believe that information and
education are the keys to liberating their homeland. HRF's goal is to assist
them with the technology, know-how, and funding they need to make a measurable
difference in this all-important battle for the freedom of 25 million North
Koreans.
HRF is a
tax-exempt 501(c)(3) non-profit. Learn more about our work at HRF.org. HRF
produces the Oslo Freedom Forum, which you can learn more about at oslofreedomforum.com.Who made the cool video?
Smock Media's mission is to produce authentic films that impact public discussion, protect the creative process of expression, and highlight amazing stories of individual triumph. Smock's founder, Hawk Jensen, is thrilled to volunteer his time and creative talents to help bring Ji Seong-ho's voice to a broader audience of supporters. Seong-ho is the physical embodiment of everything for which Smock stands. We could not be more grateful and honored to help share the story of this incredible human being who has conquered the impossible and continues to save hundreds of lives from tyranny.

<p>At Audible Earth, we believe that peace is impossible without the learning experiences that help us to better understand each others’ varying perspectives on our universe. That is why we have made it our goal to create an online resource for multicultural music education, giving individuals the opportunity to learn about these varying perspectives through music.</p>
<p>Why music? To put it simply, music touches everyone. Even those with the most distant relationship to music find that it serves some purpose in their everyday lives. Throughout history, cultures around the globe have developed their own musical languages which reflect their deepest values and beliefs, and each aspect of those languages tells a story. One mustn’t comprehend the meaning of lyrics in order to be affected by song – rhythm and melody transcend spoken word and rely merely on the profound nature of sound to deliver a purely human message that may often be inexpressible in any other tongue. It is our intent at Audible Earth to use this common ground of music as a meeting place for cultural exchange, learning, and, ultimately, the understanding that leads to peace.</p>
<p>So what do we do? As Audible Earth was just founded in spring 2012, this is not so much about what we have done, but what we hope to accomplish. Gearing up for an official launch in September 2012, we have an ambitious first year planned, including:</p>
<p>Open Ears Open Minds, an after-school music explorers club for Rhode Island high school students. In this program, students learn about music and dance from around the world through discussion, listening and watching audio and video recordings, experiencing in-class performances by visiting artists and attending live performances. Students then pass on the learning to their friends and family by writing about their musical perspectives in a student-published music magazine.<br/>Teaching Harmony, a professional development program for music and academic subject teachers that aims to change the scope of music education in the United States. Through semi-annual workshops held in southern New England, educators learn how to integrate multicultural music into their curriculum. Audible Earth expands its reach to teachers nationwide by providing free arts-integrated lesson plans in all subjects and grade levels for download from our website. We also commission arrangements of traditional pieces from cultures around the world for performance by school-level band and chorus. These arrangements are made available to music teachers across the US, making it possible for them to teach global genres while utilizing the resources they have.<br/>The Directory of Teaching Artists, an online reference for schools, community centers and anyone interested in learning about multicultural music or dance. The Directory provides free listings to Teaching Artists across the country, performers who are skilled and experienced in music and dance genres from around the world. Acting as a central resource for multicultural performing arts, the Directory makes it easy for schools to find local artists to provide cultural in-school performances or artist-in-residence programs, while aspiring musicians or music enthusiasts may use the Directory to locate private or group instruction in a style of music that is not native to the US.<br/>Who are we? Audible Earth is currently a two-woman effort, but with your help, we hope to expand our team soon!</p>
<p>Erin Young (Founder/Executive Director) founded Audible Earth in 2012 with the dream of creating an accessible resource for multicultural music education. Though trained as a classical oboist, Erin has always been enamored with the musical traditions of non-Western cultures. Having earned a B.A. from New York University in ethnomusicology, Erin has worked for two of the leading nonprofit presenters of world music and dance in the United States - World Music Institute (New York), and World Music/CRASHarts (Cambridge, MA) - managed and developed community music education programs for the Rhode Island Philharmonic, and studied music and language in Brazil.</p>
<p>Looking for an amazing music teacher to partner with, Erin teamed up with Michela Gardner (Director of Music Education), a lifelong musician with a musical lineage that goes back several generations. Primarily a singer, Michela earned a B.M. from Berklee College of Music, and a M.M. in Music Education from the Boston Conservatory. While attending the conservatory, she co-taught an undergraduate World Music Ensemble. Teaching most recently at Somerset Middle School (MA), Michela has a passion for music education advocacy and hopes to build stronger music programs in local communities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What We Need &amp; Why</p>
<p>While it is our goal to raise an ambitious $50,000 in individual contributions through our campaign, this amount represents only 25% of what we need to raise over the next year to bring our programs to life. Your contribution will not fund a short-lived project, but rather breathe life into an organization that will continue to work passionately towards a more musical and peaceful world for years to come.</p>
<p>So where does the money go? In an effort to stick to our mission and truly make multicultural music and dance education accessible to all, the majority of our services are offered for free. For example, our Open Ears Open Minds after school program is offered completely free of charge to Rhode Island school districts. Through our Teaching Harmony Program, lesson plans are developed and provided to teachers across the country for free download from our website. And through the Teaching Artists Program, representatives of the world's musical and dance cultures are given free promotion through our online Directory. In the current economic climate where cuts to education budgets and arts funding abound, we feel that it is imperative that outside organizations such as ours step up and assist students, educators and artists in any way possible so that cultural exchange, collaboration and inspiration do not become things of the past. But our programs will not exist without the generosity of individuals who understand the value of a global arts education.</p>
<p>Your donation to Audible Earth will allow high school students to attend a live Balinese gamelan performance, help a 10th-grade history teacher integrate Afghani klasik music into their current events lesson, provide an arrangement of a traditional Ewe song for middle school chorus, give a local elementary school the ability to connect with a Dominican percussionist for a 10-week artist-in-residence program, or help the woman who works at the coffee shop finally take the flamenco dance lessons she always dreamed of.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help</p>
<p>We understand (trust us!) that it is not possible for everyone to give finanically during this difficult time, even to those causes they feel passionately about. If you are interested in supporting Audible Earth but would like to do so in another way, we would love your help in spreading the word about our organization and our campaign!</p>
<p>Please forward this along to your family and friends, especially those with an interest in education, culture and the arts. You can use the share tools above to post this campaign to Facebook or Twitter. The more people who see this campaign, the better our chances of reaching our goal.</p>

Bread
& Circuses is the brain child of Kathleen Engelhardt and Susannah Taylor,

us with open arms and hearts. They looked after us as if they had adopted us to
their families.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/638970/files/20140610100802-filming_on_the_boat.jpg?1402420082"" src="""" style=""""/></p><b><i>Filming Sari and Alexan</i></b><br/><br/>The film is finished and had a tremendously

Badjao. The Badjao have no legal status in their homelands, they have no citizenship
and no ID; thus their children cannot participate in the regular Malaysian
education. The schooling of the Badjao children is left in hands of NGOs and
charity organisations. It’s still not simple – parents usually can’t afford their
kids to attend school full time – the children are needed to help the parents
at home or to earn money elsewhere. Like in many places in the world, the
financial argument is the strongest one when education is at stake.<p></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><i>Alexan and his family</i><br/></b></p><p><b>HOW</b></p>
<p>Our aim is to send our young Sari to school. He
lives on the small island of Mabul, a one hour boat ride from Semporna. There is one school on Mabul, but it is only teaching Sulu children - the Badjao kids cannot attend.</p>
<p>The situation with Badjao kids is complicated.
They are at the bottom of the community and Sulu kids are not happy to mix with
the sea gypsies. Therefore we agreed to build a separate school just for the Badjao
children. </p>
<p><b>The only way
to help Sari is to build the school for him! </b>This way, other children on Mabul will also
benefit from our action! And the school will be very close to their homes!</p>
<p>We teamed up with Torben and Roselyn Venning, the
director of PKPKM (The Society for Education of Underprivileged
Children),<span> <b><a href=""http://www.pkpkmsabah.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>www.pkpkmsabah.org</span></a></b></span>
Since 2012, they have put 1700 Badjao kids in education with help of their mobile
teaching units on the islands around Semporna and Lohad Datu and with the support from
German, Finnish and Philippine Embassies and other donors. Early next year, Torben
and Roselyn want to reach Mabul and set up a new Learning Centre. Their experience and
presence on the island is our guarantee for our successful and efficient
action.</p>
<p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/639009/files/20140610101753-Roselyn_and_kids.jpg?1402420673"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><b><i>Roselyn Venning</i><br/></b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>OUR PLAN</b></p>
<p>Firstly, we need a school building. We can build a
house. Badjao houses are fairly simple to build. A small house with just enough
room for a spacious classroom, a small facility room and a garden/playground
space. This way we will also help the parents – giving them a small paid
building job to do. Building a house will take about a month.</p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/642676/files/20140611155417-_MG_7420.jpg?1402527257"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p>Once the house is built, it will need to be
equipped with basics: tables, sitting mats, blackboards and notice boards and
the generator for the electricity supply.</p>
<p>Secondly,
we need to employ a teacher. Once, we have a committed person on board (who we
will interview personally), we will draw a teaching plan. With our teacher, we
will buy the basic teaching equipment: books, pictures, copy-books, drawing
paper, pens, paints etc. It is our ambition to buy a laptop computer, so the children
can to learn how to use electronic word processing, too.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/642668/files/20140611154715-_MG_7474.jpg?1402526835"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p>
<p>Don´t expect too much from this! Schooling the
Badjao is not about preparing for a university degree. But it is the very first
step to enable them to enter the world of education that can eventually save
their lives! The basic premise is to have reading and writing lessons in Bahasa Malaysia, with elements of basic
maths, and
importantly we will teach the children to protect the natural environment. The lessons will take place
every day, as we believe the regularity is a key factor in the education. In
the beginning, the lessons will take one hour only per day, as this is the
realistic length for the kids to afford and to be able to span their full
attention. We will provide drinking water and small snacks for the kids.</p>
<p>Then, we need to seek and select our students! We
will speak to every family on Mabul in person. It might sound strange, but it
will need trust and some convincing that the families agree to send their kids
to school because the kids usually work to contribute to the family. As we know
from the experience (not only on Borneo) we therefore also need to support the family
on the agreement that the children will attend school on a regular basis.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/642672/files/20140611154929-_MG_7442.jpg?1402526969"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>
<p>Here comes the fun bit for the Badjao: Before we
kick-off the school, we organise the screening of the film WALKING UNDER WATER
on the beach for the kids and families on Mabul with our guests of honour:
Sari, Alexan and his wife Marulina! They know us already, but now they will see
what we have been up to for all those years making a film! With such a
screening we want to raise attention amongst the Malaysian authorities and
awareness amongst diving resorts, travel agents and tourists and press not to
look away when an ancient culture is driven to pieces while we enjoy the beauty
of the sea. We will use this attention to seek among the owners of the resorts and
others for support to maintain the school and its education programme in the
long run.</p>
<p>Once the school is running, we will monitor their
education by regular Skype contact with the teacher when we discuss the
individual kids´ progress (by then we will know them personally quite well!).
We will also pay a visit after the first month and later, after six months, to
monitor the running of the school.</p>

NEED:</b></p>
<p>For 7.000 $<span>  we
can build the school</span></p>
<p>For 8.000 $<span>  we can build the school + buy a generator
and basic equipment (additional 1.000 $)</span></p>
<p>For 11.000 $<span>  we can build the school + buy a generator
and basic equipment + we can send 10 kids to school for one year.  </span></p>
<p>Sending the kids to school costs 25 $ per child and per month (this covers teaching materials and a teacher’s fee and a tip for the
parents). That means: For 3.000 $, we can educate 10 children for one full year.</p>
<p>For 7.000 $ we can travel from Europe to Borneo to
set and roll the action, to organize the screening on Mabul and to monitor the
progress in the first year of action.</p>
<p>So, our target is 18.000 $!</p>
<p><b>The more we
collect, the longer we can secure education for those kids who helped us
bringing the Badjao world to the big screen and to you.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>WHEN</b></p>
<p>Our plan is to collect the money for Sari’s school by
the end of this year and bring it in person to Mabul in January 2015 with the
school start running in March 2015!</p>

</p><p>Tworcy <i>Badjao-
duchy z morza </i>budują szkołę dla
bohatera ich filmu – Sariego, chłopca z plemienia Badjao, morskiego cygana z
wyspy Mabul na Borneo (Malezja).</p>
<p><b>Dlaczego my?</b></p>
<p>W zeszłym roku zrealizowaliśmy
film dokumentalny <i>Badjao. Duchy z morza, </i>który jest podwodną
opowieścią o ostatnich dniach Badjao, morskich nomadów z Borneo, żyjących<span> w ścisłej harmonii z naturą i
słynących z nieprzeciętnych umiejętności nurkowych. Osi</span><span>ą</span><span> dramaturgiczn</span><span>ą</span><span> filmu jest<span>  wzruszająca historia doświadczonego rybaka i
jego młodego siostrzeńca. Akcja na Indiegogo jest
naszym podziękowaniem dla naszych bohater</span></span><span>ó</span><span>w i dla tej niezwykłej kultury, którą udało się nam pokazać zanim na dobre
zniknie z powierzchni ziemi na rzecz ekspansywnej zachodniej cywilizacji.
Władze Malezji nie pomagają Badjao, widząc w nich żebraków i włóczęgów, którzy
powinni zostać natychmiast przesiedleni z mórz otaczających wyspę do slumsów
znajdujących się w głębi lądu. Jednakże czym jest ryba pozbawiona wody?</span></p>
<p><span>Film został zrealizowany na Borneo, w Sabah, w rejonie Semporny, w Malezji.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>Nasza filmowa przygoda trwała cztery lata. W tym czasie, ekipa wielokrotnie
doświadczyła niezwykłej gościnności ze strony rodzin Badjao. Ci prości ludzie,
często żyjący w skrajnym ubóstwie, przyjęli nas do siebie z otwartymi ramionami,
ofiarowali wiele serca i otoczyli taką opieką jaką otacza się członków rodziny.
</span></span></p>
<p><span>Dokument, nad którym prace zostały już zakończone, został bardzo ciepło
przyjęty przez publiczność oraz krytyków filmowych. Film miał swoją premierę na
prestiżowym HotDocs w Kanadzie- Międzynarodowym Festiwalu Filmów
Dokumentalnych, gdzie otrzymał 'Specjalną Nagrodę Jury'. Zaledwie kilka dni
później na festiwalu Planete+ Doc w Warszawie, film otrzymał nagrodę za
zdjęcia. Specjalne wyróżnienie przyznało nam również jury festiwalu w Los
Angeles. Oprócz naszych starań, aby jak najwięcej osób dowiedziało się o
historii Badjao, chcemy odwdzięczyć się Sariemu i Alexanowi oraz ich rodzinom,
w bardziej namacalny sposób, a mianowicie poprzez wybudowanie szkoły dla dzieci
Badjao na wyspie z której pochodzą.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Chcemy, aby szkoła da</span><span>ł</span><span>a im nadzieję i otworzy</span><span>ł</span><span>a szansę na lepsze życie oraz przyczyni się do zachowania tej niezwykłej
kultury. </span></p>

<p><b><span>DLACZEGO BADJAO</span></b></p>
<p><span>Dostęp do edukacji dla dzieci Badjao jest bardzo ograniczony. Badjao nie
mają żadnego statusu prawnego, nie posiadają obywatelstwa, ani dowodów
tożsamości, zatem ich dzieci nie mogą
uczestniczyć w regularnej edukacji zapewnionej przez rząd malezyjski. Edukacja
dzieci Badjao pozostaje w rękach różnych organizacji pozarządowych i
charytatywnych, jednak mimo tego rodzice zwykle nie mogą sobie pozwolić na to,
aby ich dzieci chodziły do szkoły w pełnym wymiarze godzin -<span>  są one potrzebne w domu, aby pomagać rodzicom
zarabiać pieniądze. Podobnie jak w wielu miejscach na świecie, ubóstwo
materialne jest największą barierą w rozwoju edukacyjnym dzieci. </span></span></p>
<p><b><span>JAK CHCEMY POMÓC</span></b></p>
<p><span>Celem naszej akcji jest znalezienie szko</span><span>ł</span><span>y dal Sariego. Bohater naszego filmu mieszka na małej wyspie Mabul, do
której można dopłynąć w godzinę z miasta Semporna. Na Mabul znajduje się tylko
jedna szkoła, jednak jest ona dostępna wy</span><span>łą</span><span>cznie dla dzieci z rodzin Sulu, co oznacza, że dzieci Badjao nie mogą do
niej uczęszczać. Sytuacja dzieci Badjao jest bardzo skomplikowana, pozycja
społeczna Badjao jest bardzo niska i z tego powodu dzieci Sulu, nie chcą w
swojej szkole morskich cyganów.<span>  Dlatego postanowiliśmy
wybudować osobną szkołę, która będzie dostępna dla dzieci Badjao. Jest to
jedyny sposób, aby pomóc Sariemu zdobyć edukację. Poprzez zbudowanie szkoły
specjalnie dla Sariego, pomożemy również innym dzieciom Badjao z wyspy Mabul. W
dodatku szkoła będzie się znajdować blisko ich domów. </span></span></p>
<p><span>Aby osiągnąć nasz cel, zawiązaliśmy współpracę z Torbenem i Roselyn
Venning, dyrektorem PKPKM (Towarzystwem dla edukacji dzieci z rodzin
ubogich,<span>  </span></span><a href=""http://www.pkpkmsabah.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b><span>www.pkpkmsabah.org</span></b></a><b><span>). </span></b><span>Od 2012 roku, organizacja
umożliwiła edukację 1700 dzieciom z rodzin Badjao. Udało się tego dokonać,
dzięki pomocy ich mobilnych jednostek edukacyjnych, które działają na wyspach
wokół Semporny i Lohad Datu oraz wsparciu niemieckiej, fińskiej i filipińskiej
ambasady i innych darczyńców. Na początku przyszłego roku, Torben i Roselyn
chcą dotrzeć ze swoim programem na Mabul, gdzie założą nowe Centrum Edukacyjne.
Ich doświadczenie oraz obecność na wyspie jest gwarancją na pomyślne
zakończenie naszej akcji. </span></p>
<p><b><span>NASZ PLAN </span></b></p>
<p><span>Po pierwsze potrzebujemy budynku pod szkołę. Budowa domów Badjao nie jest
skomplikowana, dlatego też planujemy sami się tym zająć. Potrzebujemy małego
budynku, w którym znajdzie się wystarczająco miejsca na przestronną klasę, małe
pomieszczenie socjalne oraz miejsce na plac zabaw dla dzieci. Chcemy, aby w
budowę włączyli się również rodzice przyszłych uczniów, dając im tym samym pracę
przy budowie, za którą otrzymają wynagrodzenie. Planujemy zakończenie budowy w
przeciągu miesiąca. </span></p>
<p><span>Gdy budynek pod szkołę zostanie już postawiony, zakupimy podstawowe
wyposażenie: biurka, maty do siedzenia, tablice do pisania i ogłosze</span><span>ń</span><span> oraz generator prądu. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Następnie zajmiemy się zatrudnieniem nauczyciela. Gdy już znajdziemy
odpowiednią osobę na to stanowisko (osobiście zajmiemy się rekrutacją), razem
stworzymy odpowiedni program nauczania. Zakupimy również potrzebne wyposażenie
dydaktyczne: książki, plansze edukacyjne, papier rysunkowy, przybory do pisania
i malowania itd. Chcemy również zakupić laptop, aby dzieci nauczyły się
obsługiwać i korzystać z komputera. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Jednak nie oczekujcie za dużo od tego przedsięwzięcia! Naszą ambicją nie
jest przygotowanie dzieci do studiów wyższych. Naszym podstawowym założeniem
jest, aby dzieci nauczyły się pisać i czytać w języku Bahasa Malaysia,
zapoznały się z podstawowymi elementami matematyki, a tak</span><span>ż</span><span>e nauczyły się chronić środowisko naturalne w jakim żyją. Wierzymy, że te
umiejętności nie tylko otworzą im drzwi do dalszej edukacji, ale również raz na
zawsze zmienią zarówno los ich jak i całego plemienia Badjao. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Chcemy, aby zajęcia odbywały się codziennie, wierzymy, że systematyczność
jest kluczowym czynnikiem w edukacji. Na początku lekcje będą trwały tylko
jedną godzinę dziennie; taki jest realistyczny czas, jaki dzieci będą mogły
poświęcić tylko nauce, z dala od swoich codziennych obowiązków. W tym czasie
szkoła zapewni uczniom przekąski i wodę do picia. </span></p>
<p><span>Następnym krokiem będzie znalezienie chętnych uczniów. Osobiście będziemy
rozmawiać na ten temat z rodzicami dzieci. Może zabrzmi to dziwnie, ale
będziemy musieli przekonać rodziców, aby zechcieli wysłać swoje dzieci do
szkoły, poniewa</span><span>ż</span><span> w tradycyjnej rodzinie Badjao,
dzieci zwykle pracują razem z rodzicami, dorzucając się tym samym do domowego
budżetu. Będziemy musieli namówić rodziców, aby posyłali dzieci do szkoły
regularnie. </span></p>
<p><span>Zanim ruszymy z budową szkoły, chcemy zapewnić dzieciom i ich rodzinom
trochę rozrywki. Planujemy zorganizować pokaz filmu <i>Badjao. Duchy z morza </i>na
plaży, na który zaprosimy mieszkańców wyspy<i>. </i>Gośćmi honorowymi będą Sari, Alexan oraz jego
żona Marulina! Chcemy, aby dowiedzieli się, czym dokładnie zajmowaliśmy się
przez ostatnie lata kręcenia filmu. Dzięki temu pokazowi, chcemy również
zwrócić uwagę i zwiększyć świadomość władz Malezji, właścicieli kurortów
turystycznych, szkół nurkowych, mediów oraz turystów na temat sytuacji w jakiej
znajdują się Badjao. Chcemy ich również zaangażować w pomoc w utrzymaniu szkoły
i programu edukacyjnego, który stworzymy dla dzieci Badjao. </span></p>
<p><span>Gdy szkoła zacznie już działać, planujemy monitorować postępy edukacyjne
dzieci, poprzez regularne rozmowy z nauczycielem za pośrednictwem Internetu.
Chcemy omawiać z nim progres poszczególnych dzieci, dzięki czemu osobiście
dowiemy się o sytuacji każdego dziecka. Aby jeszcze lepiej być zorientowanym w
sytuacji szkoły, odwiedzimy ją po pierwszym miesiącu od jej powstania, a
następnie po sześciu miesiącach. W ten sposób, będziemy mogli jeszcze szybciej
reagować na potrzeby jej uczniów i nauczyciela. </span></p>
<p><b><span>ILE PIENIĘDZY POTRZEBUJEMY</span></b></p>
<p><span>Za 7.000 $ możemy wybudować szkołę</span></p>
<p><span>Za 8.000 $ zbudujemy szkołę i zakupimy generator prądu i podstawowe
wyposażenie</span></p>
<p><span>Za 11.000 $</span><span>zbudujemy szkołę, zakupimy
generator prądu, podstawowe wyposażenie i będziemy mogli posłać 10 uczniów do
szkoły na rok</span></p>
<p><span>Koszty miesięczne utrzymania jednego dziecka w szkole to 25$ (kwota
obejmuje materiały dydaktyczne, wynagrodzenie dla nauczyciela i wsparcie dla
rodziców). Oznacza to, że za 3.000$ 10-ciu uczniów, będzie mogło przez rok
uczyć się w naszej szkole. </span></p>
<p><span>Za 7,000 $ będziemy mogli opłacić koszty podróży z Europy na Borneo teamu
zajmującego się i nadzorującego akcję, zorganizować pokaz filmu na wyspie Mabul
oraz monitorowanie postępów w pierwszym roku działania szkoły. </span></p>
<p><span>Podsumowując, naszym celem jest zebranie <b>18.000 $!</b> </span></p>
<p><span>Im więcej pieniędzy zbierzemy, tym dłużej będziemy mogli zapewnić edukację
dzieciom, które przyczyniły się do przeniesienia świata Badjao na duży ekran.<br/><br/><b>KIEDY</b></span></p>
<p><span>Planujemy zebrać potrzebne pieniądze do końca tego roku, aby móc je
osobiście przywieść na wyspę Mabul w styczniu 2015 i otworzyć szkołę dla
uczniów już w marcu. </span></p>

WHY US?
Last year we made the documentary film WALKING UNDER WATER, about the last days of
the Badjao, the Borneo sea nomads. It is the touching story of 10-year-old Sari
and his uncle Alexan, the last Badjao compressor diver from Mabul Island, and
their unique bond with the ocean. It is our tribute to their
culture which we captured the moment before it disappears, being pushed to abyss
by the modern world. The authorities don´t help the Badjao; they are seen as
gypsies that shall be driven off the sea to live in slum settlements on land.
But what is a fish without water?
FILM TRAILERWe filmed on Borneo, in Sabah, in the region of
Semporna, in Malaysia.

Our filming adventure lasted four years in total in
which we experienced the astonishing hospitality of the Badjao families many
times. These simple people live on the verge of poverty and beyond, yet they welcomed
us with open arms and hearts. They looked after us as if they had adopted us to
their families.Filming Sari and AlexanThe film is finished and had a tremendously
successful launch. At the World Premiere at the renowned HOT DOCS FILM FESTIVAL
in Toronto, it won the Special Jury Award and was praised for its amazing
poetic imagery and storytelling. Only days later at PLANETE DOC REVIEW Festival
in Warsaw, the Jury awarded us with a Special Mention for the cinematography.

However, we don’t want to leave it like that. We feel
a deep gratitude to Alexan’s family. We want to give them something that brings
hope and opens an opportunity for the future. We want to contribute to prepare
the Badjao for a future they can co-build! 
We want to enable Sari and also Alexan’s children
to attend school. 

WHO ARE WE

Eliza Kubarska – director
Eliza specializes
in adventure filmmaking and extreme location work. She is a well-known Polish alpinist
and traveler. In 2010, she made her first feature documentary „What happened on
Pam Island” (aka “Mountain Love Story”), that won many prestigious awards. She is currently directing her new documentary
„The K2 Passage“. For WALKING UNDER WATER, Eliza not only went from the
mountains to the sea; she worked on the film for more than four years with the
aim to create an outstanding cinematic film that brings to light a burning
issue of a culture vanishing.
Monika Braid – producerMonika’s passion for discovering
new friendships and places led her to filmmaking. She is an independent film
producer, who works on fiction and documentary films with international
production companies and broadcasters. In 2006, she set up her own company
Braidmade Films. Her recent credits include BBC documentary productions: A Sikh’s Journey Home, 2008, Mind the Gap, 2010, Wojtek – the Bear that Went to War, 2011 and Dad Went Fishing, 2011. Meeting Badjao on Borneo reinforced her belief that
films can also change the world’s consciousness.
Stefan
Kloos – co-producer
Stefan
Kloos is an acclaimed producer for international creative documentaries. With
his company Kloos & Co. Medien, which is based in Berlin, he has been
producing and co-producing more than a dozen award-winning films which played
at the world´s renowned film festivals. He also teaches on various aspects of
documentary filmmaking throughout the world. Stefan is a member of the German
Film Academy, of AG DOK and EDN and a winner of the renowned Grimme Award in
Germany. Among his production and coproduction credits are multi-awardwinning
films such as THE OTHER CHELSEA, GANGSTER OF LOVE, PUTIN´S KISS, AWAY FROM ALL
SUNS and AND WHO TAUGHT YOU TO DRIVE? (YOU DRIVE ME CRAZY), which was
shortlisted for the German Film Award this year. 
Film crewWHY THE
BADJAO?SARIAccess to education is almost impossible for the
Badjao. The Badjao have no legal status in their homelands, they have no citizenship
and no ID; thus their children cannot participate in the regular Malaysian
education. The schooling of the Badjao children is left in hands of NGOs and
charity organisations. It’s still not simple – parents usually can’t afford their
kids to attend school full time – the children are needed to help the parents
at home or to earn money elsewhere. Like in many places in the world, the
financial argument is the strongest one when education is at stake.











Alexan and his familyHOW
Our aim is to send our young Sari to school. He
lives on the small island of Mabul, a one hour boat ride from Semporna. There is one school on Mabul, but it is only teaching Sulu children - the Badjao kids cannot attend.
The situation with Badjao kids is complicated.
They are at the bottom of the community and Sulu kids are not happy to mix with
the sea gypsies. Therefore we agreed to build a separate school just for the Badjao
children. 
The only way
to help Sari is to build the school for him! This way, other children on Mabul will also
benefit from our action! And the school will be very close to their homes!
We teamed up with Torben and Roselyn Venning, the
director of PKPKM (The Society for Education of Underprivileged
Children), www.pkpkmsabah.org
Since 2012, they have put 1700 Badjao kids in education with help of their mobile
teaching units on the islands around Semporna and Lohad Datu and with the support from
German, Finnish and Philippine Embassies and other donors. Early next year, Torben
and Roselyn want to reach Mabul and set up a new Learning Centre. Their experience and
presence on the island is our guarantee for our successful and efficient
action.
Roselyn VenningOUR PLAN
Firstly, we need a school building. We can build a
house. Badjao houses are fairly simple to build. A small house with just enough
room for a spacious classroom, a small facility room and a garden/playground
space. This way we will also help the parents – giving them a small paid
building job to do. Building a house will take about a month.
Once the house is built, it will need to be
equipped with basics: tables, sitting mats, blackboards and notice boards and
the generator for the electricity supply.
Secondly,
we need to employ a teacher. Once, we have a committed person on board (who we
will interview personally), we will draw a teaching plan. With our teacher, we
will buy the basic teaching equipment: books, pictures, copy-books, drawing
paper, pens, paints etc. It is our ambition to buy a laptop computer, so the children
can to learn how to use electronic word processing, too.
Don´t expect too much from this! Schooling the
Badjao is not about preparing for a university degree. But it is the very first
step to enable them to enter the world of education that can eventually save
their lives! The basic premise is to have reading and writing lessons in Bahasa Malaysia, with elements of basic
maths, and
importantly we will teach the children to protect the natural environment. The lessons will take place
every day, as we believe the regularity is a key factor in the education. In
the beginning, the lessons will take one hour only per day, as this is the
realistic length for the kids to afford and to be able to span their full
attention. We will provide drinking water and small snacks for the kids.
Then, we need to seek and select our students! We
will speak to every family on Mabul in person. It might sound strange, but it
will need trust and some convincing that the families agree to send their kids
to school because the kids usually work to contribute to the family. As we know
from the experience (not only on Borneo) we therefore also need to support the family
on the agreement that the children will attend school on a regular basis.
Here comes the fun bit for the Badjao: Before we
kick-off the school, we organise the screening of the film WALKING UNDER WATER
on the beach for the kids and families on Mabul with our guests of honour:
Sari, Alexan and his wife Marulina! They know us already, but now they will see
what we have been up to for all those years making a film! With such a
screening we want to raise attention amongst the Malaysian authorities and
awareness amongst diving resorts, travel agents and tourists and press not to
look away when an ancient culture is driven to pieces while we enjoy the beauty
of the sea. We will use this attention to seek among the owners of the resorts and
others for support to maintain the school and its education programme in the
long run.
Once the school is running, we will monitor their
education by regular Skype contact with the teacher when we discuss the
individual kids´ progress (by then we will know them personally quite well!).
We will also pay a visit after the first month and later, after six months, to
monitor the running of the school.

HOW MUCH WE
NEED:
For 7.000 $  we
can build the school
For 8.000 $  we can build the school + buy a generator
and basic equipment (additional 1.000 $)
For 11.000 $  we can build the school + buy a generator
and basic equipment + we can send 10 kids to school for one year.  
Sending the kids to school costs 25 $ per child and per month (this covers teaching materials and a teacher’s fee and a tip for the
parents). That means: For 3.000 $, we can educate 10 children for one full year.
For 7.000 $ we can travel from Europe to Borneo to
set and roll the action, to organize the screening on Mabul and to monitor the
progress in the first year of action.
So, our target is 18.000 $!
The more we
collect, the longer we can secure education for those kids who helped us
bringing the Badjao world to the big screen and to you.

WHEN
Our plan is to collect the money for Sari’s school by
the end of this year and bring it in person to Mabul in January 2015 with the
school start running in March 2015!
THANK YOU TO
BADJAO
This shall be our thank you to the Badjao, to
Alexan and Sari, and for the sea nomads who deserve a life of dignity and a
future for the generations to come.
We are asking you for your help and support and we invite
you to join us on our journey to cause change! All photographs on this page: David Kaszlikowski
Tworcy Badjao-
duchy z morza budują szkołę dla
bohatera ich filmu – Sariego, chłopca z plemienia Badjao, morskiego cygana z
wyspy Mabul na Borneo (Malezja).
Dlaczego my?
W zeszłym roku zrealizowaliśmy
film dokumentalny Badjao. Duchy z morza, który jest podwodną
opowieścią o ostatnich dniach Badjao, morskich nomadów z Borneo, żyjących w ścisłej harmonii z naturą i
słynących z nieprzeciętnych umiejętności nurkowych. Osią dramaturgiczną filmu jest  wzruszająca historia doświadczonego rybaka i
jego młodego siostrzeńca. Akcja na Indiegogo jest
naszym podziękowaniem dla naszych bohaterów i dla tej niezwykłej kultury, którą udało się nam pokazać zanim na dobre
zniknie z powierzchni ziemi na rzecz ekspansywnej zachodniej cywilizacji.
Władze Malezji nie pomagają Badjao, widząc w nich żebraków i włóczęgów, którzy
powinni zostać natychmiast przesiedleni z mórz otaczających wyspę do slumsów
znajdujących się w głębi lądu. Jednakże czym jest ryba pozbawiona wody?
Film został zrealizowany na Borneo, w Sabah, w rejonie Semporny, w Malezji.

Nasza filmowa przygoda trwała cztery lata. W tym czasie, ekipa wielokrotnie
doświadczyła niezwykłej gościnności ze strony rodzin Badjao. Ci prości ludzie,
często żyjący w skrajnym ubóstwie, przyjęli nas do siebie z otwartymi ramionami,
ofiarowali wiele serca i otoczyli taką opieką jaką otacza się członków rodziny.

Dokument, nad którym prace zostały już zakończone, został bardzo ciepło
przyjęty przez publiczność oraz krytyków filmowych. Film miał swoją premierę na
prestiżowym HotDocs w Kanadzie- Międzynarodowym Festiwalu Filmów
Dokumentalnych, gdzie otrzymał 'Specjalną Nagrodę Jury'. Zaledwie kilka dni
później na festiwalu Planete+ Doc w Warszawie, film otrzymał nagrodę za
zdjęcia. Specjalne wyróżnienie przyznało nam również jury festiwalu w Los
Angeles. Oprócz naszych starań, aby jak najwięcej osób dowiedziało się o
historii Badjao, chcemy odwdzięczyć się Sariemu i Alexanowi oraz ich rodzinom,
w bardziej namacalny sposób, a mianowicie poprzez wybudowanie szkoły dla dzieci
Badjao na wyspie z której pochodzą.

Chcemy, aby szkoła dała im nadzieję i otworzyła szansę na lepsze życie oraz przyczyni się do zachowania tej niezwykłej
kultury.

filmów, których akcja rozgrywa się w ekstremalnych miejscach. Jest alpinistką i
podróżniczką. W 2010 roku zrealizowała swój pierwszy dokument pełnometrażowy Co
się wydarzyło na wyspie Pam (aka Mountain Love Story), który zdobył
wiele prestiżowych nagród. Obecnie Eliza przygotowuje nowy dokument pt. Droga
przez Baltoro (w post-produkcji). Dla Badjao. Duchy z Morza, Eliza
nie tylko zamieniła ukochane góry na morze, ale również poświęciła cztery lata
życia, aby stworzyć wyjątkowy obraz, który zwróci uwagę ludzi na palący problem
ginącej kultury.
Monika Braid - producentka

który poszedł na wojnę (2011) i Tata poszedł na ryby (2011).
Spotkanie z Badjao na Borneo, umocniło ją w przekonaniu, że film potrafi zmienić świadomość świata.
Stefan Kloos – co- producent
Stefan Kloos jest uznanym producentem międzynarodowych dokumentów kreatywnych.
Razem ze swoją firmą Kloos & Co Medien, która ma siedzibę w Berlinie,
wyprodukował ponad tuzin filmów, które zostały nagrodzone na prestiżowych

Chelsea, Gangster Of Love, Putin´S Kiss, Away From all
Suns and And Who Taught You To Drive? (You Drive Me Crazy), który w
tym roku został nominowany do Niemieckiej Nagrody Filmowej. 
DLACZEGO BADJAO
Dostęp do edukacji dla dzieci Badjao jest bardzo ograniczony. Badjao nie
mają żadnego statusu prawnego, nie posiadają obywatelstwa, ani dowodów
tożsamości, zatem ich dzieci nie mogą
uczestniczyć w regularnej edukacji zapewnionej przez rząd malezyjski. Edukacja
dzieci Badjao pozostaje w rękach różnych organizacji pozarządowych i
charytatywnych, jednak mimo tego rodzice zwykle nie mogą sobie pozwolić na to,
aby ich dzieci chodziły do szkoły w pełnym wymiarze godzin -  są one potrzebne w domu, aby pomagać rodzicom
zarabiać pieniądze. Podobnie jak w wielu miejscach na świecie, ubóstwo
materialne jest największą barierą w rozwoju edukacyjnym dzieci. 
JAK CHCEMY POMÓC
Celem naszej akcji jest znalezienie szkoły dal Sariego. Bohater naszego filmu mieszka na małej wyspie Mabul, do
której można dopłynąć w godzinę z miasta Semporna. Na Mabul znajduje się tylko
jedna szkoła, jednak jest ona dostępna wyłącznie dla dzieci z rodzin Sulu, co oznacza, że dzieci Badjao nie mogą do
niej uczęszczać. Sytuacja dzieci Badjao jest bardzo skomplikowana, pozycja
społeczna Badjao jest bardzo niska i z tego powodu dzieci Sulu, nie chcą w
swojej szkole morskich cyganów.  Dlatego postanowiliśmy
wybudować osobną szkołę, która będzie dostępna dla dzieci Badjao. Jest to
jedyny sposób, aby pomóc Sariemu zdobyć edukację. Poprzez zbudowanie szkoły
specjalnie dla Sariego, pomożemy również innym dzieciom Badjao z wyspy Mabul. W
dodatku szkoła będzie się znajdować blisko ich domów. 
Aby osiągnąć nasz cel, zawiązaliśmy współpracę z Torbenem i Roselyn
Venning, dyrektorem PKPKM (Towarzystwem dla edukacji dzieci z rodzin
ubogich,  www.pkpkmsabah.org). Od 2012 roku, organizacja
umożliwiła edukację 1700 dzieciom z rodzin Badjao. Udało się tego dokonać,
dzięki pomocy ich mobilnych jednostek edukacyjnych, które działają na wyspach
wokół Semporny i Lohad Datu oraz wsparciu niemieckiej, fińskiej i filipińskiej
ambasady i innych darczyńców. Na początku przyszłego roku, Torben i Roselyn
chcą dotrzeć ze swoim programem na Mabul, gdzie założą nowe Centrum Edukacyjne.
Ich doświadczenie oraz obecność na wyspie jest gwarancją na pomyślne
zakończenie naszej akcji. 
NASZ PLAN 
Po pierwsze potrzebujemy budynku pod szkołę. Budowa domów Badjao nie jest
skomplikowana, dlatego też planujemy sami się tym zająć. Potrzebujemy małego
budynku, w którym znajdzie się wystarczająco miejsca na przestronną klasę, małe
pomieszczenie socjalne oraz miejsce na plac zabaw dla dzieci. Chcemy, aby w
budowę włączyli się również rodzice przyszłych uczniów, dając im tym samym pracę
przy budowie, za którą otrzymają wynagrodzenie. Planujemy zakończenie budowy w
przeciągu miesiąca. 
Gdy budynek pod szkołę zostanie już postawiony, zakupimy podstawowe
wyposażenie: biurka, maty do siedzenia, tablice do pisania i ogłoszeń oraz generator prądu. 

Następnie zajmiemy się zatrudnieniem nauczyciela. Gdy już znajdziemy
odpowiednią osobę na to stanowisko (osobiście zajmiemy się rekrutacją), razem
stworzymy odpowiedni program nauczania. Zakupimy również potrzebne wyposażenie
dydaktyczne: książki, plansze edukacyjne, papier rysunkowy, przybory do pisania
i malowania itd. Chcemy również zakupić laptop, aby dzieci nauczyły się
obsługiwać i korzystać z komputera. 

Jednak nie oczekujcie za dużo od tego przedsięwzięcia! Naszą ambicją nie
jest przygotowanie dzieci do studiów wyższych. Naszym podstawowym założeniem
jest, aby dzieci nauczyły się pisać i czytać w języku Bahasa Malaysia,
zapoznały się z podstawowymi elementami matematyki, a także nauczyły się chronić środowisko naturalne w jakim żyją. Wierzymy, że te
umiejętności nie tylko otworzą im drzwi do dalszej edukacji, ale również raz na
zawsze zmienią zarówno los ich jak i całego plemienia Badjao. 

Chcemy, aby zajęcia odbywały się codziennie, wierzymy, że systematyczność
jest kluczowym czynnikiem w edukacji. Na początku lekcje będą trwały tylko
jedną godzinę dziennie; taki jest realistyczny czas, jaki dzieci będą mogły
poświęcić tylko nauce, z dala od swoich codziennych obowiązków. W tym czasie
szkoła zapewni uczniom przekąski i wodę do picia. 
Następnym krokiem będzie znalezienie chętnych uczniów. Osobiście będziemy
rozmawiać na ten temat z rodzicami dzieci. Może zabrzmi to dziwnie, ale
będziemy musieli przekonać rodziców, aby zechcieli wysłać swoje dzieci do
szkoły, ponieważ w tradycyjnej rodzinie Badjao,
dzieci zwykle pracują razem z rodzicami, dorzucając się tym samym do domowego
budżetu. Będziemy musieli namówić rodziców, aby posyłali dzieci do szkoły
regularnie. 
Zanim ruszymy z budową szkoły, chcemy zapewnić dzieciom i ich rodzinom
trochę rozrywki. Planujemy zorganizować pokaz filmu Badjao. Duchy z morza na
plaży, na który zaprosimy mieszkańców wyspy. Gośćmi honorowymi będą Sari, Alexan oraz jego
żona Marulina! Chcemy, aby dowiedzieli się, czym dokładnie zajmowaliśmy się
przez ostatnie lata kręcenia filmu. Dzięki temu pokazowi, chcemy również
zwrócić uwagę i zwiększyć świadomość władz Malezji, właścicieli kurortów
turystycznych, szkół nurkowych, mediów oraz turystów na temat sytuacji w jakiej
znajdują się Badjao. Chcemy ich również zaangażować w pomoc w utrzymaniu szkoły
i programu edukacyjnego, który stworzymy dla dzieci Badjao. 
Gdy szkoła zacznie już działać, planujemy monitorować postępy edukacyjne
dzieci, poprzez regularne rozmowy z nauczycielem za pośrednictwem Internetu.
Chcemy omawiać z nim progres poszczególnych dzieci, dzięki czemu osobiście
dowiemy się o sytuacji każdego dziecka. Aby jeszcze lepiej być zorientowanym w
sytuacji szkoły, odwiedzimy ją po pierwszym miesiącu od jej powstania, a
następnie po sześciu miesiącach. W ten sposób, będziemy mogli jeszcze szybciej
reagować na potrzeby jej uczniów i nauczyciela. 
ILE PIENIĘDZY POTRZEBUJEMY
Za 7.000 $ możemy wybudować szkołę
Za 8.000 $ zbudujemy szkołę i zakupimy generator prądu i podstawowe
wyposażenie
Za 11.000 $zbudujemy szkołę, zakupimy
generator prądu, podstawowe wyposażenie i będziemy mogli posłać 10 uczniów do
szkoły na rok
Koszty miesięczne utrzymania jednego dziecka w szkole to 25$ (kwota
obejmuje materiały dydaktyczne, wynagrodzenie dla nauczyciela i wsparcie dla
rodziców). Oznacza to, że za 3.000$ 10-ciu uczniów, będzie mogło przez rok
uczyć się w naszej szkole. 
Za 7,000 $ będziemy mogli opłacić koszty podróży z Europy na Borneo teamu
zajmującego się i nadzorującego akcję, zorganizować pokaz filmu na wyspie Mabul
oraz monitorowanie postępów w pierwszym roku działania szkoły. 
Podsumowując, naszym celem jest zebranie 18.000 $! 
Im więcej pieniędzy zbierzemy, tym dłużej będziemy mogli zapewnić edukację
dzieciom, które przyczyniły się do przeniesienia świata Badjao na duży ekran.KIEDY
Planujemy zebrać potrzebne pieniądze do końca tego roku, aby móc je
osobiście przywieść na wyspę Mabul w styczniu 2015 i otworzyć szkołę dla
uczniów już w marcu. 
DZIĘKUJEMY BADJAO
Budowa szkoły na wyspie Mabul, jest naszym podziękowaniem dla  Alexana i Sariego oraz dla całej społeczności
Badjao, którzy zasługują na godne życie i bezpieczną przyszłość dla następnych
pokoleń. 

Prosimy o waszą pomoc i wsparcie oraz zapraszamy do towarzyszenia nam w
naszej podróży, która ma na celu zmienić rzeczywistość!

HGCS’s roughly 200 students served a total of 8,841 hours of service in their community, school and

<h3>The Heck is Tot Mob?</h3>
<p>We're Cheerleaders, Organizers, and Generals for an army of average joe's that want to help, but either don't know how or dont have time. Last year we raised $2300 for Toys for Tots in our area just by asking friends to contribute if they could, or tell a friend if they couldn't. We want to do more!</p>
<p>We want to help more kids, everywhere, and not just during the holidays. Thats why we need your help. We want to establish a peer funding website, much like this one, but for kids. Kids that want to play sports, or play a real instrument in band, or go to summer camp, but financial reasons hold them back. Let's change that.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're asking for $5000, I've spent my savings to get us where we are now, and just dont have the last bit to get us the rest of the way.</p>
<p>We need a new computer. It's how we run this thing, and the one we have is on life support. laptop - $299.00 </p>
<p>We need Tax and book keeping software. ""Quickbooks for Nonprofits"" On sale - $309 at newegg.com</p>
<p>We need funds to pay the guys working on the code. - unknown, still kicking ideas around.</p>
<p>Tot Mob is an Unincorporated Nonprofit Association based in Iowa. Basically Iowa and a few other states developed this model for charities that want to have a sort of trial to see if they need to spend the money on becoming a full fledged 501c3. I'd like to have the money to file our 501c3 just in case this blows up like we hope its going to. $750 + attorney fees</p>
<p>We need a P.O. Box, I'm using my home address for this right now, and not real fond of it. $150/year</p>
<p>Anything left over goes to help set up an endowment with the Community Foundation of the Great River Bend, to make sure that Tot Mob is sustainable, now and in the future.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We're in contact with a bunch of charity and family organizations to set up a system that makes sure that we're helping kids who actually need it.

<p><i><b>PROJECT SUMMARY</b></i></p>
<p><a href=""www.thelavendereffect.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b>THE LAVENDER EFFECT</b></a>® is a
Southern California nonprofit, formed by members of the LGBTQ and Allied
community, to teach and celebrate Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and
Queer (LGBTQ) Heritage and Culture. Though our community has made enormous
strides over the past half-century, homophobia still exists, and the epidemic
of suicides by LGBTQ teens continues. There is an urgent need to demystify
the existence of LGBTQ persons, to educate both our own young people and the
population-at-large of the enormous impact we have had, and continue to have,
on civilization.</p>
<p>To commemorate World AIDS
Day, on Monday, December 1, 2014, THE LAVENDER EFFECT® launched a campaign
entitled The Oral History Project AIDS Testimonies. Funds raised during
the month of December will be used to record video testimonies from LGBTQ and
allied citizens who were integral participants in the AIDS/HIV epidemic from
the mid 1980s to present day.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1061415/files/20141201100005-AIDS-Quilt.jpg?1417456805"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

We are a
diverse group of kids from different backgrounds in Southern Maryland that

They were the youngest group to compete and not only were they able to build a submarine that completed the race; they won the “Best Spirit of the Races Award.” Due to their success, they have inspired another group of young people from the swim team to form a new sub team  --“Nautilus” -- and build a sub to compete in this year’s race.(here's our team learning about buoyancy by testing their remote control ""SeaPerch"" model sub)Our goal
is:
To
design and build a one man, non-propeller, wet submarine that will go faster
than 1.32kts., cross the finish line and attempt to manufacture as many of the
components ourselves. (team members testing different materials for the hull)We
have put in evening and weekend hours, a lot of energy, and sacrifice to
get to this point. Our team has researched the physics of
submarines in order to decide which design to pursue. Working with mentors,we
have taken apart an old jet ski to learn about propulsion, built a “SeaPerch”
model remotely-controlled submarine to learn about buoyancy and steering and met
with a ship builder to learn about how to build a hull.  Our subgroups are designing a strong hull, drive
train, buoyancy-control system, steering system, and life support and emergency

of race week.(this is how we spend our Friday evenings! meeting and working on our sub design)
By
participating in this stretch STEM project-based activity that most people don’t
expect this age group to do, we are getting excited about science and we are getting the confidence to tackle just about anything else! (here we are taking apart a jet-ski to learn about propulsion)

<p><font size=""2"">Hello! You've learned a few details about me, and below are a few more not covered in the video:<br/></font></p>
<font size=""2"">For the past decade, part of my work has involved telling the stories of 
local communities and people as a journalist. The feedback I've received has been very 
humbling, and it's great to know so many readers enjoy my work. 
Still, the shift in the industry meant I needed to change 
my strategy. It led me to refocus beyond journalism into helping companies and organizations tell their stories 
directly to the public. With the new skills and knowledge I am acquiring
 through MCDM, I can be even more effective in doing that. <br/><br/>My first quarter back in school has already stretched me in exciting ways. I am approaching a few local nonprofits to create three-minute videos for them pro bono, so I can expand my multimedia production skills while helping them showcase their work. If this is the result of merely one quarter, imagine the results of the entire program!</font><br/><p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why I'm Here</h3>
<font size=""2"">After I lost my newspaper contract and my plan to self-finance my program fell through, I began looking at other possibilities such as grants, scholarships and fellowships offered at UW. Finding opportunities in the middle of a school year is very challenging, so I am working on applications for next year. In the meantime, I decided to try the idea of a self-created scholarship fund via sponsorships where I can give something in return. I hope to attract those who can use my skills and experience in exchange for their support, but also welcome any inspirational contributions that have no offered ""perks.""</font><br/><p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><font size=""2"">The total goal of $9,000 will pay for three half-time quarters (one class per quarter, bringing me up to 20 credits out of the 45 required for the degree). In the event I exceed my goal, I will enroll full-time instead during the winter quarter. All the money raised will go to tuition, so any amount helps. Next quarter begins on Jan. 4 so I do have a bit of a time crunch for the first one-third of the goal.</font><br/></p>
<br/><h3>The Fine Print</h3>
<font size=""2"">Since the total amount covers tuition for the rest of the academic year, the ""perks"" that involve services can be claimed any time over that same time period after the campaign ends (but let me know if your need is more urgent).

Hello friends!
I have a been a student at Biola University for the past year, and I am currently preparing for my senior year.
Unfortunately, I find myself a little short on money for school this year for a variety of reasons...

My school costs about $38,000 per year to attend (including room and board).
I've tapped out all of my financial aid (loans, grants, scholarships, etc).
My family is not in a financial position to help.
A bizarre series of events this summer has left me unable to work and pay for this myself.
How You Can Help

I need prayer support. I believe in a mighty, sovereign God that has a plan and doesn't make mistakes. More than anything, I'm asking for your continued prayer as I try to raise enough money to pursue my education in Psychology.
After prayerful consideration, if you are at all able, I am asking for any kind of financial aid that you may be able to provide. There is no amount that is too great or too small... quite literally, EVERY little bit helps.
If you can, please share my link and my story to anyone and everyone you know who may be able to help!

<p><strong>The UNESCO-recognized International Mayan Council has been guided to collaborate with Synthesis 2012 as the platform through which they will share their ""Message of Synchronization"" at this most meaningful time.</strong> <strong>The council will be joined by many other elders, including don Miguel Ruiz (author of ""The Four Agreements""), Hunbatz Men, Maestro Mazatzin, and several luminary speakers, whose wisdom and insight will bring clarity and inspiration for the world as we arrive to this <em>threshold moment</em>. </strong></p>
<p>Recognizing that many people are unable to attend Synthesis 2012 in person, it is important to the producers to make certain that this phenomenal event, with its wonderful line-up of wisdom keepers, keynote speakers, musical performers, and artistic visionaries, is shared with people around the world using the most up-to-date technology available. With the magnitude of December 21, 2012 drawing the attention of millions of people, we are committed to providing a unique window into this momentous occasion for viewers worldwide, while simultaneously creating a multimedia content archive for many generations to come.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>From History to <em>Our Story</em>...</h2>
<p>Though much has been written, professed, and misinterpreted about the 'end' of the Mayan calendar, the Mayan elders maintain that the completion of the cycle is signaling a great shift in consciousness, moving from separation to unity. The galactic alignment represents a 'rebirth' for humanity and planet Earth as we cross the galactic equator, the dark rift of the Milky Way, seen by the ancient ones as the birth canal of the Great Mother. Inspired by this awareness, Synthesis 2012 has launched our campaign to raise the financial support to professionally live broadcast this unprecedented ceremony and celebration from Piste, Yucatán, and simulcast/stream several other related sacred gatherings, festivals, celebrations and synchronized meditations occurring worldwide from December 21-23, 2012. <br/><br/>Your generous contribution will help us realize our goal of sharing this momentous occasion with viewers planet-wide, and ensuring that the Mayan message, and several other related messages from world-renown wisdom keepers and contemporary luminaries, will be professionally broadcasted and archived for generations to come.</p>

SYNTHESIS 2012 is a once-in-a-lifetime global grassroots event occurring in Chichén Itzá and Piste Pueblo in the Yucatán, Mexico from December 20-23, 2012. Chichén Itzá, renown as one of the ""New Seven Wonders of the World"" (declared in 2007), is visited by an estimated 1.2 million tourists annually. This ancient temple site is an epicentre for Mayan cosmology, and will be a key location due to the synchronous alignment of the El Castillo step pyramid (also known as the Temple of Kukulkan/Quetzalcoatl), our sun, and entire solar system with the center of the Milky Way galaxy (Hunab Ku).

The UNESCO-recognized International Mayan Council has been guided to collaborate with Synthesis 2012 as the platform through which they will share their ""Message of Synchronization"" at this most meaningful time. The council will be joined by many other elders, including don Miguel Ruiz (author of ""The Four Agreements""), Hunbatz Men, Maestro Mazatzin, and several luminary speakers, whose wisdom and insight will bring clarity and inspiration for the world as we arrive to this threshold moment.

</h3> <p>The Uganda Society is a membership based organization in Uganda's capital Kampala. Founded in 1923 it's the oldest library in the country and offers a wide variety of books from colonial times up to present. <br/></p>
<p>My name is Wartson and i voluntarily work at this library since 2013 as the only person being there during opening hours. The stock includes lots of rare and helpfull books on natural history, ethnography, travels (of missionaries and explorers) and other topics. It's the biggest collection of this kind of books in the country, since most others (including Makerere University) have been destroyed during civil war times. Since there is a lack of resources the books can't be kept under proper conditions and start to slowly falling apart. That is why we need r to digitize the books and save the knowledge for future generations. With an air conditioner it would be possible to save the books and their smell from our tropical climate.<br/></p> <p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>The project</h3>
<p>To digitize the books we need, of course, a scanner. We are right now interested in to the piQx Xcanex Portable Book and Document Scanner, which goes for around 300$ abroad, taxes and shipping will be added. But to use the scanner, we also need a computer first. This will also give us the chance to create a online catalogue for researchers to make it easier for people to find the treassures we keep here. We calculate around 550$ for that. The air conditioner goes for around 350$ and would rescue the books which are currently under critical conditions. To repair those, which are not so healthy anymore we plan to spend around 500$ for repairing works and new binding. With a photocopier our visitors could copy from the library and don't need to take the old books to the nearest copyshop. A new one goes for around 300$ in Uganda. <br/></p>
<p>So with an amount of 2000$ we could save our books and preserve Uganda's historical, cultural and scientific diversity. If we cannot achieve this goal, we will start with the scanning before it is to late.<br/></p>

Play Communs Story

Play communs is a toy that has been developed over one year by Ultra
Ordinaire, a research team managed by Duffau&Associés.
Our aim was to “create objects that can be modified,
fixed and adapted by the user“.
This work results from a collaboration with several innovative
communities within the fields of sciences, engineering, design and creation concentrated upon
the construction of a product that is at once sober, adaptable, modifiable and shareable.
The team consists of:



For the electronics: Snootlab French society created in 2010, official
Arduino dealer, designing and developing electronics within an approach of Open
hardware and Open source.


For coding: Theo de la Hogue and Pol Perez (From GMEA)


For creation: Nathalie Bruyère & Pierre Duffau (Duffau&associés) with assistance from Charlie Aubry, Irina Pentecouteau, Cécile Laporte.



The kit is already on sale at the arduino store & snootlab !

What we need for further developement

We
aim to collect funds to develop a community of makers that supports the values of sharing, enhancing, modifying, adapting and fixing. The web site
Ultra-ordinaire.com is available where drawings can be
shared.




Production timeline
1st series : Premium Kit for Christmas
NOVEMBER : Order and commencement of production of the kits.
DECEMBER : Reception, assembling and packing of the kits.

Why we need your help
We have fully functional samples of
Play Communs that are ready for production. Although we have big ambitions, we are
a small company and only have the capacity to finance modest production
runs.  Placing an order for multiple
thousands of units is beyond our grasp. This is where you come in. 
You can help us to increase the amount of product we can order from the
factory as well as accelerate the speed with which we can get it into the homes
of our customers.",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

The Southeast Michigan Dyke
March is a non-profit organization with the goal of promoting visibility of the
area’s lesbian, transgender, bisexual and queer community. We are currently
finalizing the Second Annual Southeast Michigan Dyke March and Rally for June
4, 2011, in Downtown Ferndale in celebration and promotion of visibility,
equality, and vitality.
 
The Southeast Michigan Dyke
March is based on a worldwide movement. We use the term Dyke March as a means
of identifying with other dyke marches that came before us started by the
Lesbian Avengers in 1993. Since their march in Washington D.C. with 20,000
participants, similar marches have been formed in cities like Boston, Chicago,
Toronto, San Francisco, Denver, New York and now Detroit. (Source: About.com)
It was intended to bring a sense of inclusion and promote visibility for the
queer female community. Now many dyke marches, like ours, are inclusive of all
queer groups across boundaries of sex, race, gender identity, religion, body
type, economic class, sexuality, ethnicity, age, ability, and geographical
origin.
                                 
We Need
People Like You
 
Each year the cost of
running the march and rally increases, as well as our involvement in other
programs. Being a completely volunteer run and community funded non-profit, we
are looking for generous donors.
 
After June 4th we will be
continuing our educational and social outreach events while acting as a fresh
voice in the LGBTQA community. Our events are designed for all ages and all
walks of life providing information, inspiration, education, representation
and, of course, fun.

<p>My name is Darren.  I am leaving my job in the States to travel to Nepal to help open this childcare center.  My friend Dipendra is from Nepal.  He came to visit the non-profit where I work in Virginia City, Nevada called Community Chest Inc. through a State Department grant.  He learned about how we address social justice issues through our food bank, thrift store, mental health services, and early childhood education programs.  Based on what he learned from his visit here, Dipendra wants to open up a childcare centre in his village just outside of Kathmandu.  He has asked that I help him with this project.  I said yes and will be traveling to Nepal on October 15th to help make this happen.  </p>
<p>This center will develop the health of young children, employ women, and begin the process of sustainable development for this region.  Your contribution will make it possible for us to open this small facility.  Once open, the centre will host International volunteers who will form a donor base upon which the center will continue to operate.</p>
<p>We need $10,000 to open and operate the childcare center for one year.  This center will serve 40 children and fund 4 staff members.  This amount would also cover food, doctor's visits, dental check-ups, and materials and instruction for the children.  As you can tell, dollars can accomplish quite a bit more in a country like Nepal than they can in the States.  Any contribution that you can make gets us one step closer to making this a reality.</p>
<p>If we do not receive the entire $10,000 of funding for this project, we will at least have a good start on this project.  With the demonstrated support of this campaign, we will have a better chance at obtaining the remaining funds from foundations and other donors.</p>
<p>Not only will this project prepare Nepalese youngsters for success in school, but this childcare centre will also employ local women and allow parents and guardians to earn additional money to pay for basic necessities.  </p>
<p>If you are unable to contribute financially, that is OK.  There are certain times when I am not in a position to help with a cause that I would like to.  If you are unable to give dollars, please get the word out to others who may be able to help.  Everyone who reads this is an integral part of making this project happen.  Thank you!</p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Hi friends,

<h3>The Summary</h3>
<p></p>We are your 2013 Vic Slam Team - a collection of lovely individuals coming together as a whole to represent Victoria's spoken word community on the national stage at the 10th annual Canadian Festival of Spoken Word/Festival canadien de spoken word - happening this year in Montreal, November 4th-9th.  We're very excited with the words we have to bring, and the ones we plan to craft together.  We hope to build off the momentum charge of last year's team and make Victoria's biggest impact yet in the national spoken word community.<p><br/>This is an exciting and challenging endeavor for all of us.  Not just in terms of the competition, which puts us up against nearly 100 of the hottest poets in Canada, but also in stealing away from our day-to-day lives in Victoria and the work and school commitments that comes with.  And so we turn to you.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Pitch</h3>
<p></p>
<p>As you probably already know, it's a pretty pricey endeavor to travel and accommodate across Canada for a week.  Especially as a group of six!  This is where we reach out to you for a boost.  Thanks to the amazing audiences who came out for Vic Slam Semis and Finals we have ourselves a nice little nest egg to kickstart our travel costs.  Coupled with some exciting upcoming shows, we should have ourselves most of the way to our estimate budget of $6,000 for the teams total travel/accommodation costs.  Here we ask you to help us take it to the brink.  If we raise $2000 here on the interwebs, we should have the rock solid finances in place to make sure we can represent Victoria to the fullest without incurring debt in the process.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">If this campaign goes really crazy and we exceed our funding goals as they're currently laid out, we will make use of extra monies to make sure we're sharing healthy meals together throughout our adventure.  If we have an excess of extra funds leftover after eating we will pay forward any extra into a nest egg for next year's team!</span><br/></p>
<p>In exchange for your directly helping us travel, sleep and eat we would like to give you things.  We have many strange and exciting things we can offer for your efforts. Beginning with our eternal gratitude - which has no price point!  We also want to offer up fun opportunities like your own poems, or a show in your home, or the chance to have Shayne and Johnny come and make you dinner.  A chance for us to do more of the things we love in exchange for your help getting us to Montreal!<br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">The Impact</span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>You are directly helping us get to Montreal to represent Victoria to the best of our abilities.  We can't emphasize this enough.  With all of us taking a week off of work and/or school, the support of the community in getting us across the country to represent us as a whole means so much to us, and greatly helps ease the impact on the rest-of-our-lives during this excursion.</p>
<p>Your contributions can also greatly add to our direct success in the competition, as each one allows us to spend more time working on new and existing pieces and less time figuring out financial logistics.  This allowance for more writing and workshopping further focuses our ability to bring our strongest performances possible in the tournament, and hopefully bring the trophies home.</p>
<p>If this fundraising effort is a raging success then we are all helping further the Victoria spoken word community by carrying forward a surplus of funds toward sending further poets to national events to represent Victoria and keep our scene vibrant and growing both locally and nationally.  We have a lot to offer and the rest of the country is catching on quickly.  Your contributions all help us nurture and build upon that.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Are you broke?  A poet?  Both?  You can still support us by helping spread the word if you're unable to contribute monetarily.  Every tweet, tumble, stumble and share helps spread the word to help us spread our words, and this is all about sharing and community.  So every bit of support in any and every way is appreciated deeply and dearly, and helps to nurture and further build our community.</p>
<p>Thanks for being. </p>

Hi, my name is Jack. I know you have all heard of me before, I'm the guy who climbs an enormous beanstalk to retrieve the princess' amulet. But today I would like to tell you the real story of HOW I was actually able to accomplish such a feat.
My adventure all starts with a simple math question. I know what you're thinking - how does math have anything to do with my epic adventure? Let me confess to you my secret to confronting and out-smarting a giant; the secret is MATH. I used math to initially buy the beans, I used math to help sort through the giant's treasure of all sorts of geometric shapes to help me find the amulet, and I used math for just about every major obstacle on my journey.
Join me on my epic math adventure where you can help me avoid being boiled for breakfast or  figure out if I will have enough time to make it down the beanstalk before the giant catches me.
 
 
 

Do you want to help Jack solve his GIANT problems? Then this is your chance!  For a limited time (Pre-Launch of app) receive the entire PDF book of ""Jack and the Beanstalk a Mathematical Adventure"" for FREE!!!
You will also receive updates & progress of the development of the App and you will be the first to know exactly when Jack will launch his epic mathematical adventure.
 
 
Hi. My name is Justin Holladay and I'm a Math Teacher and now iOS Game designer, I have developed an extensive background in the education realm. My passion for helping students reinforce essential math skills led me in attaining a B.Ed. and B.A.S. in Mathematics/Science. As an iOS game designer, I'm pursuing my passion of supporting teachers in effective teaching and integration of math games into their daily lessons. 
 
 I love developing and designing new math games that can be utilized in the classroom and then ""played"" (practised but kids think they're playing) at home. 
 
In November, 2012, I released my first math game on the App Store, since then I have released three more math apps

PERSONAL NOTE:
I'm a worried parent of 5 young kids and was a frustrated middle school math teacher wanting to change this system. Students nowadays hate math (and score poorly too). My smart 8 year old son in grade 3 told me the other day that he hates math class. This shocked me! I'm a math teacher and I love math and my own son is learning at school to dread it.
 
I believe students need to spend more time ""doing"" math and less time drilling math. They need to be practicing, thinking, and applying mathematics every day BUT worksheets, tests, boring homework (please do questions 1-56) and any drill and kill type methods are hindering our children from mastering math! 
 
I’ve realized that as a parent and math teacher I need to be able to raise children that also love math. What I want to do is also branch out from creating middle school apps, that my children are too young to use, to create interactive math games/adventures that my kids can use and play and learn to love math now! 
 
My next project is going to be a Mathematical storybook adventure. You know all those storybook apps out there that your kids ""listen"" I mean “read” then tap everywhere on the screen with no real reason. With my math adventure the students will be read a story (maybe they’ll read it themselves too) and then be required to help the character to solve a math problem or activity. 
 
I NEED YOUR HELP
 
I need to raise $5,000 to cover the cost of development of my mathematical storybook app or development will be SLOWED, i'll never stop, but will have to bootstrap slowly. All artwork and voice work are already complete. 
So I'm turning to my strongest supporters to ask for contributions. In exchange, I'm offering ALL my apps FREE to you and your school or school district. Your contribution will help me to continue developing and focusing my time on creating and developing my math apps, and further, it will help our kids learn to love math!! . Thanks!
