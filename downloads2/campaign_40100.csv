<p>There
is no doubt that we are now experiencing the effects of our changing climate

communities, how we revitalize our economy and how we create a sustainable
future. We know that Florida is especially vulnerable with more than 1,200
miles of coastline, almost 4,500 square miles of estuaries and bays, and most

<p>We believe that action is imperative
and that public understanding of the issues and impacts of sea level rise are
critical. We are working to create a simulated animated video that will raise
public awareness, but we need your help. Funds raised will help support the
production of a photorealistic 3D animation to simulate the effects of sea
level rise from the point of view of an individual. A comparison will be made

J. Johnson, wife of Commander Johnson, and commissioned 10 August 1944, Lieutenant Commander J. H. Campbell in command.</p><p></p><p>Blower arrived at Pearl Harbor 16 December 1944 and, after undergoing voyage repairs and training exercises got underway for her first war patrol 17 January 1945. She completed three war patrols before the termination of hostilities, all in the Java and South China seas. All three patrols proved unprofitable for Blower and she arrived at Fremantle, Australia, from her last patrol 28 July 1945. Blower departed the Southwest Pacific in September 1945 and, after engaging in training exercises around the Marianas and Caroline Islands for several months, proceeded to the United States via Pearl Harbor, arriving at San Diego 29 January 1946.</p><p></p><p>From 1946 through 1949 Blower was attached to the Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet. She operated mainly along the west coast on scheduled torpedo exercises submerged sound school operations, and training programs. During the latter part of 1946 she made a cruise to Japan, via Pearl Harbor and the Marianas. Early in 1947 she participated in fleet operations near Pearl Harbor.</p><p></p><p>During August–September 1948 Blower operated in Alaskan waters with Carp (SS-338) patrolling along the contour of the Arctic ice pack in the Chukchi Sea, carrying out radar tracking and sonar exercises. Returning to San Diego, the ship continued scheduled operations until early 1950 when she departed for the east coast to join Submarine Force, Atlantic Fleet. She arrived at Philadelphia 3 March and underwent repairs at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard until September. On 27 September she arrived at New London, Connecticut, where she trained Turkish naval personnel.</p><p></p><p>TCG Dumlupınar</p><p>Blower was decommissioned at the Naval Submarine Base New London, 16 November 1950 and transferred to Turkey under the Mutual Defense Assistance Program, where she was recommissioned as the second TCG Dumlupınar. She was lost on 4 April 1953, when, returning from the NATO maneuver Blue-Sea, TCG Dumlupınar collided in the Dardanelles off the Nara Point with the Swedish freighter Naboland and sank. Eighty-one submariners died in this accident.</p><p></p><p>The story of Dumlupinar unfolded on 4 April 1953, while returning from the Nato training mission ""Blue Sea"", she collided with the Swedish cargo ship Naboland in Nara region, Canakkale (Dardanelles) and sank. Presently she is lying in 90 meters depth.</p><p></p><p>TCG Inonu I and TCG Dumlupinar submarines started their voyage home to Golcuk after completing their missions in the Nato training in Mediterranean. In the night of April 3/4, they passed Canakkale straits returning home without knowing what will happen. The trip for Dumlupinar has ended with a tragic accident at April 4, 1953 02:10 a.m. with a tragic accident.</p><p></p><p>Lieutenant Huseyin Inkaya was on the deck watch continuing his duty although he was not on shift. While they were near Nara, something strange caught his eyes on their course. Right at that moment, there was a loud noise that none understand where came from and the soldiers fall to the sea. Only the five of the eight watch crew that where on the deck while collision were lucky to open their eyes in water. The two of them died terribly with the propellers of Dumlupinar and one of sailors was drowned.Swedish steamer SS Naboland was collieded to Dumlupinar from her bow torpedo room starboard side. The sound of the collision has been heard from the ships anchored in the Eceabat harbor. Dumlupinar that has faced to this huge impact, started sinking from front compartments. And she couldn't resist the huge collision and sunk to the Dardanelles straits' dark waters in seconds. But some of the crew was survived and locked themselves to stern torpedo room. There was a huge explosion in the central compartment of Dumlupinar that makes her sink faster. There was no electricity. The sailors that saw the submarine was taking water from bow, tried to reach to the stern. They lost a lot of their friends while trying to reach the stern torpedo compartment. While Dumlupinar was sinking, 22 sailors reached the stern torpedo compartment.</p><p></p><p>Same night, the Custom's ship that was anchored in the Eceabat Harbour, was warned by a small motor ship. The person on the ship told them about the collision near Nara and asked them to get to the scene. When the ship reached to the collision area, the sea was like a circus area. All of Naboland's rescue boats were on sea, they have threw their phosphorus life jackets to sea and fired a lot of flares. Custom's ship has taken on board the rescued sailors from Dumlupinar who was on the sea or rescued by the rescue boats. The sailors have been taken to the hospitals around very quickly. But still there was 81 person under the water, no one knows if they were still alive or not. There was nothing else to do but to hope that they were alive and they call the ""Kurtaran"" (Rescuer) ship, the submarine rescue ship.</p><p></p><p>The sun had started to rise in Nara bay. Because of the light weather the fishing boats around the area saw the emergency communication buoy thrown by Dumlupinar while she was sinking. The custom's ship went directly to the comm. buoy and the second handsman of the customs ship Selim Yoluduz reached for the phone located inside of the comm. buoy and read the inscription on it that says ""Dumlupinar submarine commissioned to the Turkish Navy sunk here, Open the hatch and contact with submarine"". He opened the hatch and took the phone and started to talk with hope.</p><p></p><p>The customs officer waiting an answer has been relax when he heard the answer: ""Yes, I am Lieutenant Selami"". Getting the answer what he was waiting, Selim Yoluduz asked to the Lt. Selami about their condition. The answer that he got was explaining the horrible condition in Dumllupinar. Lt. Selami told him that the submarine was staying still 15 degrees to starboard, that their electricity was off and they were 22 persons in the stern torpedo room. Selim Yoluduz told him that they were in the Nara bay of Canakkale and their submarine was in approximately 90 meters depth. He said ""don't worry we will get you out of there. Kurtaran (The Rescuer) is on its way."" The words that Lt. Selami told him has been written to his ears and heart : ""We salute our families. We know that you will save us. For our country...""</p><p></p><p>This was the first conversation of Lt Selami with the people on the surface. The people hope was fading out while the rescue tries of the Kurtaran ship that came approximately 11:00 was giving out no results. After the first conversation the people talked to Lt Selami were in order Canakkale Sea Forces Admiral Zeki Adar, Selim Yoluduz and second captain of the Inonu I Submarine, Suat Tezcan. While the time of alive crew at stern was passing slowly and their oxygen too, they were ordered to no talking, singing or smoking for using their oxygen economically, the hopes were fading out on the surface. Although surface and rescue crew says: there was no hesitate or sadness in the voice of Lt. Selami. After a while for another conversation: they reached for the phone. The sounds coming was like they were waiting for their will. They were praying. Surface crew explained the situation to alive crew with same words ""You can talk, sing even you can smoke""Approximately at 15:00 the cable that was holding the communication buoy broke. There would be no other news from Dumlupinar...</p><p></p><p>The words ""For our country"" was the last words heard from the Dumlupinar lying in 84 meters depth. After the accident, when Admiral Sadik Altincan, Governor Safaeddin Karnakci and other authorities arrived to the region, the rescue operations started. In the mean time Inonu 1 submarine who didn't notice the accident returned to the accident region to help the rescue operations. There were other ships on the water to help the rescue operations. The rescue operations continued in the drafty waters of Canakkale but this efforts couldn't save the crew of Dumlupinar. Divers unsuccessfully attempted to secure a rescue apparatus to the stricken submarine.</p><p></p><p>At 2:15 AM Tuesday morning, three days after the initial accident, the rising CO2 levels inside the submarine would have killed any surviving crew. The rescue operation was abandoned. The following day at 15:00 a ceremony was held on the ship ""Basaran"".</p></div>","TCG Dumlupınar, 4 Nisan1953 günü I.

During the latter part of 1946 she made a cruise to Japan, via Pearl Harbor and the Marianas. Early in 1947 she participated in fleet operations near Pearl Harbor.During August–September 1948 Blower operated in Alaskan waters with Carp (SS-338) patrolling along the contour of the Arctic ice pack in the Chukchi Sea, carrying out radar tracking and sonar exercises. Returning to San Diego, the ship continued scheduled operations until early 1950 when she departed for the east coast to join Submarine Force, Atlantic Fleet. She arrived at Philadelphia 3 March and underwent repairs at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard until September. On 27 September she arrived at New London, Connecticut, where she trained Turkish naval personnel.TCG DumlupınarBlower was decommissioned at the Naval Submarine Base New London, 16 November 1950 and transferred to Turkey under the Mutual Defense Assistance Program, where she was recommissioned as the second TCG Dumlupınar. She was lost on 4 April 1953, when, returning from the NATO maneuver Blue-Sea, TCG Dumlupınar collided in the Dardanelles off the Nara Point with the Swedish freighter Naboland and sank. Eighty-one submariners died in this accident.The story of Dumlupinar unfolded on 4 April 1953, while returning from the Nato training mission ""Blue Sea"", she collided with the Swedish cargo ship Naboland in Nara region, Canakkale (Dardanelles) and sank. Presently she is lying in 90 meters depth.TCG Inonu I and TCG Dumlupinar submarines started their voyage home to Golcuk after completing their missions in the Nato training in Mediterranean. In the night of April 3/4, they passed Canakkale straits returning home without knowing what will happen. The trip for Dumlupinar has ended with a tragic accident at April 4, 1953 02:10 a.m. with a tragic accident.Lieutenant Huseyin Inkaya was on the deck watch continuing his duty although he was not on shift. While they were near Nara, something strange caught his eyes on their course. Right at that moment, there was a loud noise that none understand where came from and the soldiers fall to the sea. Only the five of the eight watch crew that where on the deck while collision were lucky to open their eyes in water. The two of them died terribly with the propellers of Dumlupinar and one of sailors was drowned.Swedish steamer SS Naboland was collieded to Dumlupinar from her bow torpedo room starboard side. The sound of the collision has been heard from the ships anchored in the Eceabat harbor. Dumlupinar that has faced to this huge impact, started sinking from front compartments. And she couldn't resist the huge collision and sunk to the Dardanelles straits' dark waters in seconds. But some of the crew was survived and locked themselves to stern torpedo room. There was a huge explosion in the central compartment of Dumlupinar that makes her sink faster. There was no electricity. The sailors that saw the submarine was taking water from bow, tried to reach to the stern. They lost a lot of their friends while trying to reach the stern torpedo compartment. While Dumlupinar was sinking, 22 sailors reached the stern torpedo compartment.Same night, the Custom's ship that was anchored in the Eceabat Harbour, was warned by a small motor ship. The person on the ship told them about the collision near Nara and asked them to get to the scene. When the ship reached to the collision area, the sea was like a circus area. All of Naboland's rescue boats were on sea, they have threw their phosphorus life jackets to sea and fired a lot of flares. Custom's ship has taken on board the rescued sailors from Dumlupinar who was on the sea or rescued by the rescue boats. The sailors have been taken to the hospitals around very quickly. But still there was 81 person under the water, no one knows if they were still alive or not. There was nothing else to do but to hope that they were alive and they call the ""Kurtaran"" (Rescuer) ship, the submarine rescue ship.The sun had started to rise in Nara bay. Because of the light weather the fishing boats around the area saw the emergency communication buoy thrown by Dumlupinar while she was sinking. The custom's ship went directly to the comm. buoy and the second handsman of the customs ship Selim Yoluduz reached for the phone located inside of the comm. buoy and read the inscription on it that says ""Dumlupinar submarine commissioned to the Turkish Navy sunk here, Open the hatch and contact with submarine"". He opened the hatch and took the phone and started to talk with hope.The customs officer waiting an answer has been relax when he heard the answer: ""Yes, I am Lieutenant Selami"". Getting the answer what he was waiting, Selim Yoluduz asked to the Lt. Selami about their condition. The answer that he got was explaining the horrible condition in Dumllupinar. Lt. Selami told him that the submarine was staying still 15 degrees to starboard, that their electricity was off and they were 22 persons in the stern torpedo room. Selim Yoluduz told him that they were in the Nara bay of Canakkale and their submarine was in approximately 90 meters depth. He said ""don't worry we will get you out of there. Kurtaran (The Rescuer) is on its way."" The words that Lt. Selami told him has been written to his ears and heart : ""We salute our families. We know that you will save us. For our country...""This was the first conversation of Lt Selami with the people on the surface. The people hope was fading out while the rescue tries of the Kurtaran ship that came approximately 11:00 was giving out no results. After the first conversation the people talked to Lt Selami were in order Canakkale Sea Forces Admiral Zeki Adar, Selim Yoluduz and second captain of the Inonu I Submarine, Suat Tezcan. While the time of alive crew at stern was passing slowly and their oxygen too, they were ordered to no talking, singing or smoking for using their oxygen economically, the hopes were fading out on the surface. Although surface and rescue crew says: there was no hesitate or sadness in the voice of Lt. Selami. After a while for another conversation: they reached for the phone. The sounds coming was like they were waiting for their will. They were praying. Surface crew explained the situation to alive crew with same words ""You can talk, sing even you can smoke""Approximately at 15:00 the cable that was holding the communication buoy broke. There would be no other news from Dumlupinar...The words ""For our country"" was the last words heard from the Dumlupinar lying in 84 meters depth. After the accident, when Admiral Sadik Altincan, Governor Safaeddin Karnakci and other authorities arrived to the region, the rescue operations started. In the mean time Inonu 1 submarine who didn't notice the accident returned to the accident region to help the rescue operations. There were other ships on the water to help the rescue operations. The rescue operations continued in the drafty waters of Canakkale but this efforts couldn't save the crew of Dumlupinar. Divers unsuccessfully attempted to secure a rescue apparatus to the stricken submarine.At 2:15 AM Tuesday morning, three days after the initial accident, the rising CO2 levels inside the submarine would have killed any surviving crew. The rescue operation was abandoned. The following day at 15:00 a ceremony was held on the ship ""Basaran"".",0.0,1,"2 Campaigns

<h2><strong>Why Should You Care?</strong></h2>
<p>We have one chance to do right by our Earth and future generations. With enough people affecting a small change, it becomes bigger. After all, a grain of sand on its own is often overlooked, but enough grains of sand make a beach. More impact and more significance.  If we educate students about the possibilities that technology can produce for them, we all benefit. Our students will be better equipped to handle the need for sustainable and affordable energy. We will substantially decrease our carbon footprint and the damage we’re causing to the environment. The cost of energy will come down for homeowners, businesses and industries. And lastly, we will have contributed to leaving the world a better place than we found it. You and I can effect change. Together we can make a difference.</p>
<h2><strong>Why Choose Us?</strong></h2>
<p>We can’t sit idly and watch energy prices soar at the cost of our environment. We want to be the launch pad for something amazing. We can all be part of something that has meaning, worth and value. For Current Energy it's teaching today’s technology to the future of the planet.

About Us
Established in 2010, Current Energy is an eco-conscious company specializing in Solar Thermal energy systems for residential, recreational, commercial and industrial uses. As well as the owner and operator of this company, I am also a Secondary School teacher in the discipline of Technology Education. To top that off, I am also the Lead for the largest Technology Department in my School Board.
For decades we have watched the environment deteriorate in the name of “human progress”. We are rapidly depleting our fossil fuel supplies and exploiting our planet as we consume from it. Moses Henry Cass said, “We have not inherited this earth from our parents to do with it what we will. We have borrowed it from our children and we must be careful to use it in their interests as well as our own.”
At Current Energy, we believe it is our responsibility to teach the next generation to leverage the sustainable resources around them and build towards a cleaner and brighter future we can all live with.
 
 
 



 
 
Our Products
Solar thermal energy systems function differently than the traditional photovoltaic solar cell that most people are familiar with. Our systems consist of an array of evacuated glass tubes and a heat transfer medium. Our tubes feature a special coating that absorbs light energy from the sun and traps it inside. The energy is then transferred to glycol, water or copper heat pipes that move the converted light-to-heat energy to where it is needed.
  
Our Idea
By combining our knowledge of solar thermal energy and our love of teaching it is our goal to:

Supply the 900+ Ontario Secondary Schools with a Current Energy Solar Tube Kit & Education package
Raise and create a $5,000 scholarship for secondary students pursuing education in alternative energy technology
Create an ‘Open Source Education Group’ for alternative energies so that any student or educator can benefit from this program, regardless of their geographic or financial situation.

<h3>Background and Project Summary</h3>
<p>My husband and I met in Brazil 8 years ago, my husband (Toty) is from Argentina but had at which point been living in the local area for many years.  I am from the UK, and had been travelling through South America, but when I came to this beautiful little town in Bahia, Brazil, I also fell in love with it.  However, o<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">ver the years we have seen more tourists arriving and more foreign investment which has undoubted positively helped the local area financially with more locals now working within the tourist industry, however along with this we have also seen the negative impact on the local natural environment, and how once preserved nearby mata-atlantic (forest areas) are being bought up by hotels, and foreign investors, resulting in much of nature being burnt down to allow for builds, </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">the rates of deforestation in Brazil is frightening and we need your help to be part of the solution and not the problem.</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> </span></p>
<p>It upsets us to see locals and visitors to the area neglecting the beautiful natural environment.  There's an increase in trash now visible on the streets, and many people don't yet understand the need for recycling and re-use.  Local children are not being educated to help protect and cherish their local environment, and local people are building their homes using man made environmentally unfriendly materials, which are not only more expensive and therefore difficult for them to buy, but are also having a negative impact on the environment. People do not yet understand the benefits of sustainable energy and water solutions, and massive wastage of both energy and water in the area is clearly visible.</p>
<p>Over the past few years we have been researching and developing the eco-Taipe project, getting support from local people, and we hope it will help create a solution to this problem.  We have found and bought the perfect piece of land which would otherwise have been bought by a foreign investor ready to burn it down and build an ugly tourist report.  Instead we want to use this space to create Eco-Taipe.</p>

<p>I am requesting donations to write a mermaid book that inspires people to care for the waters of planet earth by connecting with their creative imagination and the spirit in nature. I see a great need for playful, magical, and positive healing approaches to stewardship of Mother Earth’s waters.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Mermaid Book</p>
<p>The main character of the book is a mermaid named Brita who cares for the waters of Mother Earth. Brita teaches us about how to nurture and care for our water especially our source waters and our “inner waters”—or our emotional self. Brita heals people’s inner-waters with her joy and magic. She has many adventures, and she takes us along for the ride—or swim!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Who Benefits</p>
<p>All living things benefit from this project. For over ten years, I have been part of a  movement of people, projects, new consciousness that is teaching and re-connecting children and adults with the sacredness of nature, our planet, and waters. I’d like to see more children involved including the inner-children of adults. Caring for the earth and her waters must be our top priority.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>How This Project Will Help The World</p>
<p>One important teaching is that to take care of our planet, we must come from a joyful place, a place of nurturing care and concern. The old stories of guilt, blame, and shame… or judgment no longer serve us. It is time for peaceful contributions to be offered and accepted. Let’s inspire each other with our creativity!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Healing Our Hearts</p>
<p>The mermaid book also addresses the personal healing of our inner emotions—or inner-waters. (Humans are composed of more than 77% water. What we think or feel is “broadcast” out in the world, carried by the water.) When we are activated to heal ourselves and open our creative energies, we become healthy, happy, and available for healing others and all living things. Whether a male or female, Brita can teach us to honor and appreciate our intuitive, feminine feeling gifts, or right brain.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My Background of Service to Mother Earth</p>
<p>I am a writer, small business owner, alternative healer, teacher, and mother of a teenage son. I have a deep commitment to being a voice for the plant kingdom and its medicine and teachings, and for the water. For many years I have been helping people with emotional healing using flower essences that I created. Flower essences are a flower-based plant medicine that is carried in water and popularized by Dr. Bach in the 1930s.</p>

<p>Traveling on Behalf of the Waters</p>
<p>These last few years, I have been traveling full-time with my partner, a Native American ceremonial leader, doing ceremony for the water and Mother Earth. We have been traveling in California, Pacific Northwest, Canada, and the Southwest and have dedicated our lives to be in service by teaching and catalyzing others to honor and care for Mother Earth and her living waters. We receive a small income when we teach and donations for ceremony we lead. Our expenses are low yet we are not bringing in enough to cover our expenses.

<p>My Dream</p>
<p>My dream is to write a mermaid book—as a voice for the spirit of the waters. I feel I am destined to write books that will contribute towards positive change and healing for our planet. The book about Brita the Mermaid will offer a launching pad for the message of caring for the waters to be broadcast to many more people. I am not only excited about writing but about teaching, speaking, doing interviews, and spreading mermaid Brita’s message worldwide!</p>

<h2><strong>What is Bosque Fluir (Flowing Forest)?</strong></h2>
<p>Flowing Forest is a permaculture project open to all people that want to have an authentic experience of connection with peace, beauty and biodiversity of the amazonic nature, located in the highlands of Sauce, Peru, with the view of the blue lagoon (laguna azul).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581626037/iljogyi3bbuarrgm28ua.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Who is in charge?</h3>
<p>I am Diego Oroch, a young journalist, conservationist and music lover. Before I arrived here, I had many volunteering experiences through the Peruvian Jungle and in Lima. When I was finishing my career, feeling overwhelmed from living in Lima, a big city of 10 million people, somebody that loves me, told me: “Create the life you want to live” and here I am. On August 2018 I made the first step to create a crazy Green Project; a space to live in harmony with the amazon rainforest and invite people to listen to their self nature. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581626081/eianiy6gpilsbgtrha0q.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>With the support of my family, friends and neighbors we are dealing with the challenge to protect the forest from the threat of deforestation, and making it a space of harmony, cooperation for the animals and plants of the Amazonas. I hope to open the forest for exploring and to teach  alternative sustainable living.</p>
<h3>What is the dream that inspired us?</h3>
<p>The main objective is to create a self-sustainable space, where anyone can live as a brotherhood sharing in a healthy and natural way, learning to live sustainably, take care of mother earth, have fun, chill, heal naturally, view upon the birds and flowers. An environment that allows us to find our equilibrium in our lives and express our creativity.</p>
<p>Bosque Fluir is going to open the eyes of the district of Sauce to concepts of sustainability, like permaculture, bio-construction, collection and filtering of rainwater, solar energy, and nature medicine. Also, the use of a compost area and uses of used water to avoid any pollution.</p>
<p>Here we have a responsibility to restore our surroundings, for species in danger and medical trees. That’s why we create an area of conservation, reforesting and education. The wood that we’re using is coming from the surroundings and we’re going to plant another tree for every tree used.</p>
<p>Because we are located in the high jungle, we are going to offer an experience that won’t be forgotten through submersion into the amazon. For example, there exists a pleasent natural stream that flows through the rear of the Flowing Forest for around 250 meters. Us, along with animal life are dependent on this stream.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581700235/kebzkwekhe5fudbwhr0f.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Flowing Forest is going to offer several activities such as yoga, meditation, music, painting, wellness workshops, classes for cooking sustainable cuisine with organic products, and more. From here you can rest from a birds eye view from a platform in the trees or hike to see beautiful waterfalls.</p>
<p>The fruit farm tours will be within our hectares of 20 different kind of fruit trees. Including cacao, pineapple, avocado, coffee, mandarine, and many jungle fruits (majambo, pijuayo, anona, and more). All the fruit we grow are grown without chemicals or pesticides.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581716463/y5jvbd8tuy9bupjmpnmb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Connection with the environment:</h3>
<p>Build a sustainable space that shares better practices on conservation, where the visitors can participate and have benefits from the bioconstruction, the rainwater, solar energy, garden and farm. Apart from that breath clean air thanks to our reforestation project.</p>
<p>Activities to connect with and enjoy the nature: Having a shower in the waterfall, herbs baths, birdwatching and climbing trees.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581717535/xyb4grtfbm63hb2qzpqt.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Connection with others:</h3>
<p>Volunteering: The idea is to build this dream with volunteers from all over the world. We want to include people from all different cultures, origins, ages and professions with the same compromise of conservation. Also we propose guidelines to follow the sumak kawsay. (good living)</p>
<p>Harmonious and communitarian coexistence. We are going to have coexisting agreements, to have a conscious experience without drugs, alcohol, weapons, and the least plastic possible.</p>
<p>The plan for Flowing Forest is to not be exclusive, it is for people like Diego, nature lovers, adventurous by heart, and people with lots of desire to learn and share.</p>
<h3>Connection with yourself:</h3>
<p>Yoga and meditation: in the beginning or/and in the end of the day.</p>
<p>Forest baths - including dance and Mindfulness.</p>
<p>Emotional workshops and non-violent communication.</p>
<p>Conscious feed: Cooking workshops with sustainable organic products</p>
<h3>What we have done:</h3>
<p>House: For now, we have a communitary space where four people can sleep, but we’re projecting to build little houses made of mud, wood, bamboo, and palm leaves, and also install a couple of comfortable tents. We’re also planning to build a big house of two floors for ten people, made for volunteers and guests. All these buildings are going to have an eco-friendly dry bathroom.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581717085/fqclaers4fw6qazlskav.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Paths: Inside the 7 hectares, we are designing trails and buildings to do the activities we already mentioned.</p>
<h3>What we need:</h3>
<p><strong>Volunteers wanting to help:</strong></p>
<p>Hands, brains and hearts that want to help with building, farming, reforesting, and putting the space in order. Who can stay living while our agreement of mutual collaboration lasts.</p>
<p><strong>Financial support: </strong></p>
<p>We are asking for 5,000 euros for now because we need to start as soon as possible, but in reality it is more necessary to finish the project as we imagine it.</p>
<p>Our main objectives are to build a place to receive guests and volunteers in a comfortable space. To cure and take care of the fruit trees that already produce organic fruits. Reforest an area full of an invasive plant species. Construct bungalows, malocas, and bathrooms. And create a water system to supply for the main areas</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581717452/ubwsiibva6oi17ifvq1f.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Necessities:</h3>
<p>Bungalows: €1,000 for materials and the salary of the workers.</p>
<p>Maloca: €4,000 for materials, salaries, (Malocas are large circular buildings designed for yoga, dance, meditation, and other group activities.</p>
<p>Water system: €1,000 for tubes and the instillation of the water system. Filtration for drinkable water and the construction of dry bathrooms with sinks.</p>
<p>Reforestation: €1,000 for the transportation of plants, removal of the invasive plants, and to buy tools and to plant trees.</p>
<p>Medicinal Garden: €500 for clearing the area and transportation of plants.</p>
<p>Renewable energy: €2,000 to buy solar panels, batteries and energy converters.</p>
<p>Materials for wellness activities: €500 for buying materials for yoga and meditation.</p>
<p>We estimate that it will cost €10,000 to complete the first step of the Flowing Forest.</p>

<h2>¿Qué es el Bosque Fluir?</h2>
<p>Es un proyecto de permacultura abierto a todas las personas que deseen tener una experiencia auténtica de conexión con la paz, la belleza y la biodiversidad que caracteriza a la naturaleza amazónica, ubicada en las parte alta del distrito de Sauce en la región San Martín, con vista a la Laguna Azul.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581721536/z7xfjqgw5cknswuqiogj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>¿Quién dirige este proyecto?</h3>
<p>Soy Diego Oroch , un joven comunicador, conservacionista y melómano. Antes de llegar aquí hice muchos trabajos de voluntariado recorriendo el Perú. Cuando estaba terminando mis estudios en la universidad, un poco agobiado por vivir en Lima, una selva de cemento de 10 millones de habitantes, alguien que me quiere me dijo: “Invéntate una vida que te guste” y aquí estoy. En agosto del 2018 di un primer paso en la creación de un loco proyecto verde; un espacio para vivir en armonía con el bosque amazónico e invitar a los demás a escuchar su naturaleza interior.</p>
<p>Con el apoyo de mi familia, amigos y vecinos estamos afrontando el reto de proteger el bosque de las amenazas de la deforestación y afianzarlo como un espacio de convivencia armoniosa de la fauna y flora amazónica con las personas del mundo. Se trata de abrir el bosque para explorar y enseñar alternativas de vida sostenible.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581721677/tqwntubvw5ouppmwpxbu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>¿Cuál es el sueño que nos inspira?</h3>
<p>Nuestro objetivo es construir un espacio autosustentable donde se puede convivir en hermandad de manera sana y natural, compartiendo el cuidado por la madre tierra, disfrutando de la acción y la aventura en la naturaleza, así como la contemplación de ella. Un entorno que permita encontrar nuestro equilibrio, sirva para inspirarse y expresarse creativamente.</p>
<p>El Bosque Fluir ampliará la visión del distrito hacia conceptos de sostenibilidad, tales como la permacultura, la bio-construcción, la recolección y el filtrado de agua de lluvia, la energía solar, la medicina natural. Además del uso de compostera y reutilización de las aguas residuales para evitar toda contaminación.</p>
<p>Estamos comprometidos a la reforestación y la replantación del lugar, con especies en peligro de extinción o árboles con propiedades medicinales. Así creamos las áreas de reforestación, conservación y educación. La madera que utilizamos proviene de los árboles de los alrededores y se volverá a plantar otro árbol por cada árbol talado.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581721895/vox2qptq37eee04odj0n.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Al estar ubicado en la selva alta, propondremos una experiencia inolvidable de inmersión en fauna y flora amazónica con excursiones entre plataformas en árboles, caminatas a bellas cataratas, recorridos agroforestales y más. Además, contamos con una piscina natural que está en uno de los bordes del terreno, muy indispensable para animales y humanos.</p>
<p>Boflu ofrecerá varias actividades como el yoga, la meditación, la música, el arte, talleres de bienestar, masajes, recorridos agroforestales y, en el huerto medicinal, clases de cocina sostenible con productos orgánicos locales y más. </p>
<p>Los recorridos agroforestales se darán dentro de las dos hectáreas de 20 frutas diferentes que ya existen, entre los que se encuentra cacao, palta (aguacate), lúcuma, majambo, pijuayo, piña y más. Todas estas frutas que no tienen uso de ningún químico ni pesticida.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581721864/leidubjpgol1uqqcgibw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Conexión con el ambiente: </h3>
<p>Construir un espacio sostenible que irradie buenas prácticas de conservación en la zona y en los visitantes del bosque que participen en el trabajo y los beneficios de la bioconstrucción, recolección de agua de lluvia, energía solar, jardinería, y huerta orgánica. Además de la respirar aire puro gracias a la reforestación.</p>
<p>Actividades de conexión y disfrute en la naturaleza: Baños en la quebrada, Baños de hierbas, avistamiento de aves y rapel.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581721948/xlfeweaikn7d3eudf2sd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

</div></div>","What is Bosque Fluir (Flowing Forest)?
Flowing Forest is a permaculture project open to all people that want to have an authentic experience of connection with peace, beauty and biodiversity of the amazonic nature, located in the highlands of Sauce, Peru, with the view of the blue lagoon (laguna azul).

Who is in charge?
I am Diego Oroch, a young journalist, conservationist and music lover. Before I arrived here, I had many volunteering experiences through the Peruvian Jungle and in Lima. When I was finishing my career, feeling overwhelmed from living in Lima, a big city of 10 million people, somebody that loves me, told me: “Create the life you want to live” and here I am. On August 2018 I made the first step to create a crazy Green Project; a space to live in harmony with the amazon rainforest and invite people to listen to their self nature. 
With the support of my family, friends and neighbors we are dealing with the challenge to protect the forest from the threat of deforestation, and making it a space of harmony, cooperation for the animals and plants of the Amazonas. I hope to open the forest for exploring and to teach  alternative sustainable living.
What is the dream that inspired us?
The main objective is to create a self-sustainable space, where anyone can live as a brotherhood sharing in a healthy and natural way, learning to live sustainably, take care of mother earth, have fun, chill, heal naturally, view upon the birds and flowers. An environment that allows us to find our equilibrium in our lives and express our creativity.
Bosque Fluir is going to open the eyes of the district of Sauce to concepts of sustainability, like permaculture, bio-construction, collection and filtering of rainwater, solar energy, and nature medicine. Also, the use of a compost area and uses of used water to avoid any pollution.
Here we have a responsibility to restore our surroundings, for species in danger and medical trees. That’s why we create an area of conservation, reforesting and education. The wood that we’re using is coming from the surroundings and we’re going to plant another tree for every tree used.
Because we are located in the high jungle, we are going to offer an experience that won’t be forgotten through submersion into the amazon. For example, there exists a pleasent natural stream that flows through the rear of the Flowing Forest for around 250 meters. Us, along with animal life are dependent on this stream.
Flowing Forest is going to offer several activities such as yoga, meditation, music, painting, wellness workshops, classes for cooking sustainable cuisine with organic products, and more. From here you can rest from a birds eye view from a platform in the trees or hike to see beautiful waterfalls.
The fruit farm tours will be within our hectares of 20 different kind of fruit trees. Including cacao, pineapple, avocado, coffee, mandarine, and many jungle fruits (majambo, pijuayo, anona, and more). All the fruit we grow are grown without chemicals or pesticides.
Connection with the environment:
Build a sustainable space that shares better practices on conservation, where the visitors can participate and have benefits from the bioconstruction, the rainwater, solar energy, garden and farm. Apart from that breath clean air thanks to our reforestation project.
Activities to connect with and enjoy the nature: Having a shower in the waterfall, herbs baths, birdwatching and climbing trees.

Connection with others:
Volunteering: The idea is to build this dream with volunteers from all over the world. We want to include people from all different cultures, origins, ages and professions with the same compromise of conservation. Also we propose guidelines to follow the sumak kawsay. (good living)
Harmonious and communitarian coexistence. We are going to have coexisting agreements, to have a conscious experience without drugs, alcohol, weapons, and the least plastic possible.
The plan for Flowing Forest is to not be exclusive, it is for people like Diego, nature lovers, adventurous by heart, and people with lots of desire to learn and share.
Connection with yourself:
Yoga and meditation: in the beginning or/and in the end of the day.
Forest baths - including dance and Mindfulness.
Emotional workshops and non-violent communication.
Conscious feed: Cooking workshops with sustainable organic products
What we have done:
House: For now, we have a communitary space where four people can sleep, but we’re projecting to build little houses made of mud, wood, bamboo, and palm leaves, and also install a couple of comfortable tents. We’re also planning to build a big house of two floors for ten people, made for volunteers and guests. All these buildings are going to have an eco-friendly dry bathroom.

Paths: Inside the 7 hectares, we are designing trails and buildings to do the activities we already mentioned.
What we need:
Volunteers wanting to help:
Hands, brains and hearts that want to help with building, farming, reforesting, and putting the space in order. Who can stay living while our agreement of mutual collaboration lasts.
Financial support: 
We are asking for 5,000 euros for now because we need to start as soon as possible, but in reality it is more necessary to finish the project as we imagine it.
Our main objectives are to build a place to receive guests and volunteers in a comfortable space. To cure and take care of the fruit trees that already produce organic fruits. Reforest an area full of an invasive plant species. Construct bungalows, malocas, and bathrooms. And create a water system to supply for the main areas

Necessities:
Bungalows: €1,000 for materials and the salary of the workers.
Maloca: €4,000 for materials, salaries, (Malocas are large circular buildings designed for yoga, dance, meditation, and other group activities.
Water system: €1,000 for tubes and the instillation of the water system. Filtration for drinkable water and the construction of dry bathrooms with sinks.
Reforestation: €1,000 for the transportation of plants, removal of the invasive plants, and to buy tools and to plant trees.
Medicinal Garden: €500 for clearing the area and transportation of plants.
Renewable energy: €2,000 to buy solar panels, batteries and energy converters.
Materials for wellness activities: €500 for buying materials for yoga and meditation.
We estimate that it will cost €10,000 to complete the first step of the Flowing Forest.

¿Qué es el Bosque Fluir?
Es un proyecto de permacultura abierto a todas las personas que deseen tener una experiencia auténtica de conexión con la paz, la belleza y la biodiversidad que caracteriza a la naturaleza amazónica, ubicada en las parte alta del distrito de Sauce en la región San Martín, con vista a la Laguna Azul.

¿Quién dirige este proyecto?
Soy Diego Oroch , un joven comunicador, conservacionista y melómano. Antes de llegar aquí hice muchos trabajos de voluntariado recorriendo el Perú. Cuando estaba terminando mis estudios en la universidad, un poco agobiado por vivir en Lima, una selva de cemento de 10 millones de habitantes, alguien que me quiere me dijo: “Invéntate una vida que te guste” y aquí estoy. En agosto del 2018 di un primer paso en la creación de un loco proyecto verde; un espacio para vivir en armonía con el bosque amazónico e invitar a los demás a escuchar su naturaleza interior.
Con el apoyo de mi familia, amigos y vecinos estamos afrontando el reto de proteger el bosque de las amenazas de la deforestación y afianzarlo como un espacio de convivencia armoniosa de la fauna y flora amazónica con las personas del mundo. Se trata de abrir el bosque para explorar y enseñar alternativas de vida sostenible.

¿Cuál es el sueño que nos inspira?
Nuestro objetivo es construir un espacio autosustentable donde se puede convivir en hermandad de manera sana y natural, compartiendo el cuidado por la madre tierra, disfrutando de la acción y la aventura en la naturaleza, así como la contemplación de ella. Un entorno que permita encontrar nuestro equilibrio, sirva para inspirarse y expresarse creativamente.
El Bosque Fluir ampliará la visión del distrito hacia conceptos de sostenibilidad, tales como la permacultura, la bio-construcción, la recolección y el filtrado de agua de lluvia, la energía solar, la medicina natural. Además del uso de compostera y reutilización de las aguas residuales para evitar toda contaminación.
Estamos comprometidos a la reforestación y la replantación del lugar, con especies en peligro de extinción o árboles con propiedades medicinales. Así creamos las áreas de reforestación, conservación y educación. La madera que utilizamos proviene de los árboles de los alrededores y se volverá a plantar otro árbol por cada árbol talado.

Al estar ubicado en la selva alta, propondremos una experiencia inolvidable de inmersión en fauna y flora amazónica con excursiones entre plataformas en árboles, caminatas a bellas cataratas, recorridos agroforestales y más. Además, contamos con una piscina natural que está en uno de los bordes del terreno, muy indispensable para animales y humanos.
Boflu ofrecerá varias actividades como el yoga, la meditación, la música, el arte, talleres de bienestar, masajes, recorridos agroforestales y, en el huerto medicinal, clases de cocina sostenible con productos orgánicos locales y más. 
Los recorridos agroforestales se darán dentro de las dos hectáreas de 20 frutas diferentes que ya existen, entre los que se encuentra cacao, palta (aguacate), lúcuma, majambo, pijuayo, piña y más. Todas estas frutas que no tienen uso de ningún químico ni pesticida.
Conexión con el ambiente: 
Construir un espacio sostenible que irradie buenas prácticas de conservación en la zona y en los visitantes del bosque que participen en el trabajo y los beneficios de la bioconstrucción, recolección de agua de lluvia, energía solar, jardinería, y huerta orgánica. Además de la respirar aire puro gracias a la reforestación.
Actividades de conexión y disfrute en la naturaleza: Baños en la quebrada, Baños de hierbas, avistamiento de aves y rapel.

Conexión con los demás:
Voluntariado: La idea es construir este sueño con voluntari@s soñadores/as de todo el mundo. Queremos reunir personas de diferentes culturas, orígenes, edades y profesiones con el mismo compromiso de conservación. Además de proponer los principios equilibrados del sumak kawsay (buen vivir).
Convivencia armoniosa y comunitaria (visitantes). Vamos a practicar acuerdos de convivencia, para una experiencia individual consciente no llevar drogas, no consumo de alcohol. Además, no armas y reducir el plástico.
Conexión contigo mismo:
 Yoga y Meditación al inicio y/o final del día.
 Baños del bosque – Danza, Movimiento y Mindfulness.
Talleres de emociones y comunicación son violencia.
Alimentación consciente: talleres de cocina sostenible con productos orgánicos locales.
Lo que hemos avanzado: 
Alojamiento: Por ahora contamos con un espacio rústico de bienvenida donde pueden dormir 4 personas, pero se proyecta construir cabañas de barro, bambú, madera y shapaja (techo de hojas) y carpas rústicas seguras. Se construirán una casa grande para voluntarios y visitas que será de dos pisos para 10 personas y las bases de 2 cabañas pequeñas más. Cada una contará con baños secos y duchas cómodas.

Caminos: En las 7 hectáreas del Bosque Fluir estamos diseñando caminos y espacios para las actividades descritas.
Lo que necesitamos: 
El trabajo voluntario:
Manos, cerebros y corazones que quieran apoyar a construir, plantar, reforestar y ordenar el espacio. Quienes podrán quedarse mientras dure nuestro acuerdo mutuo de colaboración.

El aporte económico: 
Hemos calculado 5,000 euros para esta primera fase y necesitamos empezar lo antes posible, pero en realidad se necesitará más, para terminar el proyecto. 
Nuestros objetivos principales para esta fase son acondicionar el lugar para recibir visitantes y voluntarios en lugares amistosos donde puedan hacer una conexión en los tres niveles propuestos. Curar y cuidar los árboles frutales que ya nos proveen de frutas orgánicas. Reforestar el área invadida de plantas voluntarias (también conocidas como maleza). Construir las cabañas, la maloca y los baños. Y crear un sistema de agua que alimente a las áreas principales.

Necesidades:
Cabañas: €1,000 para materiales y el salario de constructores para cada cabaña.
Maloca: €4,000 para materiales, salarios, gran edificio circular para yoga, danza, meditación y diferentes actividades grupales.
Sistema de agua: €1,000 para la tubería y la instalación subterránea del agua de lluvia. Filtración para consumo, y la construcción de baños secos con lavatorios.
Reforestación: €1,000 en transportar plantones, remover la maleza, comprar herramientas y plantar.
Huerto medicinal: €500 para habilitar el espacio y traer las plantas.
Energías renovables: €2,000 para comprar paneles solares, baterías y convertidores e instalarlos.
Materiales de bienestar: €500 para comprar materiales de yoga, meditación.
Estimamos que serían €10,000 para completar la importantísima primera fase del Bosque Fluir.

</div><div>
<p></p>
<b></b>
</div>
<p><b>Sunseed Desert Technology </b>is a non-profit educational
project within an eco-village in Spain. Our mission is to research, demonstrate
and communicate methods of sustainable living and environmental stewardship in
a semi-arid environment.</p>
<p>Through accessible, low-tech and practical learning, our
research is directly applicable to low-income societies and a transition
to an environmentally sustainable future.</p>
<p>Originally conceived 30 years ago as a non-governmental
organisation (NGO), we
identified desertification as our central research objective. We now
offer hands-on educational experiences for volunteers to gain practical
knowledge in many diverse areas such as eco-construction, clean energy technologies,
permaculture, naturally-sourced household and cosmetic products, and water
management.</p>

<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>WHY WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT</h3>
<p>Over the past year, Sunseed has incurred a number of extraordinary maintenance costs. These have included urgent structural repairs to our traditional Andalusian buildings that were crucial to ensure the safety and well being of our guests. We've had to recondition our van's engine (a vital resource as we live in one of the largest deserts in Europe) and to pay for new batteries for our solar power energy systems. We've also had to re-build our bio-gas stove in our main house which is crucial to survive the extreme cold winters in the region.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Taken all together, the timing of the above mentioned expenditures have been tragically unfortunate. <b>We now face a precarious financial situation where the possibility of Sunseed's closure is a reality.</b> We are seeking funding to ensure the continuation of the practical environmental education and research undertaken at Sunseed, and improve our volunteer programmes.</p>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">WHAT WE NEED TO KEEP THE PROJECT ALIVE</span>
</div><div>
<p><span>To keep Sunseed alive, altogether we seek to raise 10 000€ (This includes asking   5 000€ from our community, as we are attempting to raise funds from other sources as well - To this date we have raised just over 4 000€). The indiegogo budget breaks down as follows:</span></p>

<h3>HOW WE PLAN TO SUSTAIN SUNSEED</h3>
<p>Over the years, Sunseed has attracted volunteers from across the 5 continents. They are guided through immersive and holistic learning journeys in order to gain practical skills related to environmental stewardship. The quality of Sunseed programmes have been recognised in the past by major international bodies, such as the European Union's Lifelong Learning programme.</p>
<h3></h3>
<p>Sunseed has been self-sustainable for over 30 years and we have a clear strategy to stay this way.  We would like to reiterate that we have never needed to ask for funds through a crowdfunding campaign before, and we have had to do so due to the aforementioned circumstances. <br/></p>
<p>We will continue to stand true to our reputation and offer education in areas such as: <br/></p>

Sunseed Desert Technology is a non-profit educational
project within an eco-village in Spain. Our mission is to research, demonstrate
and communicate methods of sustainable living and environmental stewardship in
a semi-arid environment.
Through accessible, low-tech and practical learning, our
research is directly applicable to low-income societies and a transition
to an environmentally sustainable future.
Originally conceived 30 years ago as a non-governmental
organisation (NGO), we
identified desertification as our central research objective. We now
offer hands-on educational experiences for volunteers to gain practical
knowledge in many diverse areas such as eco-construction, clean energy technologies,
permaculture, naturally-sourced household and cosmetic products, and water
management.




   WHY WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT
Over the past year, Sunseed has incurred a number of extraordinary maintenance costs. These have included urgent structural repairs to our traditional Andalusian buildings that were crucial to ensure the safety and well being of our guests. We've had to recondition our van's engine (a vital resource as we live in one of the largest deserts in Europe) and to pay for new batteries for our solar power energy systems. We've also had to re-build our bio-gas stove in our main house which is crucial to survive the extreme cold winters in the region.

Taken all together, the timing of the above mentioned expenditures have been tragically unfortunate. We now face a precarious financial situation where the possibility of Sunseed's closure is a reality. We are seeking funding to ensure the continuation of the practical environmental education and research undertaken at Sunseed, and improve our volunteer programmes.
WHAT WE NEED TO KEEP THE PROJECT ALIVE

To keep Sunseed alive, altogether we seek to raise 10 000€ (This includes asking   5 000€ from our community, as we are attempting to raise funds from other sources as well - To this date we have raised just over 4 000€). The indiegogo budget breaks down as follows:




HOW WE PLAN TO SUSTAIN SUNSEED
Over the years, Sunseed has attracted volunteers from across the 5 continents. They are guided through immersive and holistic learning journeys in order to gain practical skills related to environmental stewardship. The quality of Sunseed programmes have been recognised in the past by major international bodies, such as the European Union's Lifelong Learning programme.

Sunseed has been self-sustainable for over 30 years and we have a clear strategy to stay this way.  We would like to reiterate that we have never needed to ask for funds through a crowdfunding campaign before, and we have had to do so due to the aforementioned circumstances. 
We will continue to stand true to our reputation and offer education in areas such as: 



Permaculture courses
How to build photovoltaic
     and wind powered systems
Eco-construction methods
Techniques for managing
     soil quality in semi-arid conditions 





SOME OF OUR KEY FUTURE PROJECTS



Projects that will become a reality through this campaign include:


Appropriate
Technology 


Create and share guides to pedal
     powered washing machine that can be used in any climate and
     without electricity
Construct two wind
     turbines – primarily from reclaimed materials – and creating
     detailed plans for replication across the world
Design and build a GEK
     (Gasifier experimental kit). The GEK is an open source design
     utilizing common materials and automation electronics for a very efficient
     gasifier that can also power a generator for electricity, heat up water,
     and produce bio-char or tar

Drylands Management 

Continue to research and educate on practical, low-cost methods for combating desertification. Methods include 'key-line' technology, and mycorrhiza techniques for plant germination


Restoration of water catchment systems to increase water sustainability.
Complete our waste water management system for the treatment of all greywater at Sunseed


Organic Gardens

To create a self-sufficient Seedbank of local and old seed varieties. Sunseed will also collaborate with local seed networks to coordinate this work at a regional level
Incorporate biodynamic and vegan horticulture techniques into our gardens whilst highlighting to volunteers how to create and manage thriving gardens without the need for animal fertilisation




Eco-construction 

Develop and share techniques on making naturally-sourced plaster mixes and experiment with natural water-proofing materials such as chumba

Research and develop natural insulation materials, such as slip straw, and educate on their applications


Sustainable Living


Make all milk on-site from own produce such as almonds and oats. Continue with grain and seed milk trials and communicate research through the internet
Research and develop information and practice on vegan nutrition methods





   


A FEW MEMBERS OF OUR TEAM OF EXPERTS 
All our departments are operated by our visionary full-time voluntary staff team, who work tirelessly to ensure volunteers visiting Sunseed gain an enriching education. From self-sustainability, green energy, and low-impact living, visitors ultimately gain the knowledge to replicate the skills learnt in their own countries and around the world.




Jack (34), England, Eco Construction Coordinator        




Jack originally developed his construction skills working with strawbale houses and earthships: both innovative methods based on reusing recycled materials. In recent years he has focused on construction techniques that utilise the locally abundant renewable resource of Caña (Cane).
“The positive energy found at Sunseed, the eagerness to research and experiment, the beauty of the place itself and the international diversity allows borders to disappear. It creates an open space to share knowledge and integrate with a mix of cultures.”

 Delphine (27), France, Drylands Management Coordinator


Delphine draws upon her academic foundations, as a trained engineer and her specialisation in environmental management to combat desertification.
“An aspect of my role is to sustainably plant trees, with the aim of disrupting erosion. We apply new techniques to regenerate the soil.”




Marina (25), Spain, Education Coordinator
Marina has her roots grounded within
teaching and a passion for permaculture projects – two vital veins
of Sunseed life.
“We are
dedicated to sharing the information and knowledge that Sunseed volunteers and
coordinators create with local schools and universities. Sunseed
offers opportunities for practical work experience and internships.”

Tom (29), England, Facilitation Coordinator                   
Tom has recently joined Sunseed and provides oversight on the administrative, financial and funding of Sunseed. His previous experience includes working with numerous environmental campaigning and human rights organisations. 
“In addition to ensuring financial sustainability for Sunseed, it’s my goal to continue to develop and implement non-hierarchical organising structures. I believe many who come to Sunseed can learn from such progressive techniques and continue to exercise them in their own lives.""

There are also many pita (agave) and chumba (cactus), introduced to Spain from Mexico. It is a beautiful environment that inspires locals and visitors alike.


OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP US


As we move through uncertain times ecologically, politically, and socially, we feel it's more important than ever to ensure sustainability, permaculture, community, and clean energy are pegged as priorities to everyone's personal agenda. Can you help us continue to achieve this and create a sustainable future?
To our knowledge, we are the only practical education project researching desertification and other environmental threats in Europe. We now need funds to ensure the continuation of our important work and that generations of volunteers can benefit from the unique learning programmes that we offer.
If you can't support us through monetary donations, you can help publicise Sunseed's work through social media, or contact us with ideas. Even better, come and visit us in Spain. You're more than welcome any time!

Jack (34), Inglaterra, Coordinador de Eco-construcción
Jack se inició en el campo de
la construcción trabajando
con el uso de balas de paja en construcción de casas, y construyendo viviendas tipo
earthship: ambas técnicas usan material reciclado de forma innovadora. En los últimos años se ha especializado en técnicas que
hacen uso de un abundante material renovable, la caña.
“La energía positiva que
puede encontrarse en Sunseed, las ganas de investigar y experimentar, la propia
belleza del paraje y la diversidad internacional hacen que las fronteras
desaparezcan. Sunseed crea un espacio abierto en el que compartir conocimiento
e integrarse en una mezcla de culturas”.
Delphine (27), Francia, Coordinadora de la Gestión de zonas áridas
Delphine emplea
su formación académica, tanto
como ingeniera como gracias a su especialización en gestión medioambiental, para combatir la
desertificación.
“Un aspecto de
mi labor es plantar árboles de forma sostenible, con el objetivo de detener la erosión. Aplicamos
nuevas técnicas para
regenerar el suelo”.
Marina (25), España, Coordinadora de Educación
Marina se apoya
en su pasión por la enseñanza y los proyectos de permacultura - dos aspectos
fundamentales de la vida en Sunseed.
“Nos dedicamos a
compartir la información y el conocimiento creado por los coordinadores y voluntarios de
Sunseed con escuelas locales y universidades. Sunseed ofrece la posibilidad de
realizar estancias y trabajos prácticos”.
Tom (29),
Inglaterra, Coordinador de Instalaciones
Tom se ha unido
recientemente a Sunseed, y colabora con la supervisión de la
financiación, administración y
contabilidad en Sunseed. Sus experiencias previas incluyen el trabajo con
numerosas organizaciones medioambientales y de derechos humanos.
“Además de asegurar la estabilidad financiera de Sunseed, mi objetivo es
continuar desarrollando e implementando estructuras de organización no jerárquicas. Creo muchos de los que vienen a
Sunseed puede aprender de este tipo de técnicas progresistas y seguir aplicándolas en su
vida diaria”.
DÓNDE
NOS ENCONTRAMOS
Nuestras
instalaciones están en el valle del Rio Aguas, cerca de Almería, al sureste
de España. La vegetación circundantes
es típicamente
mediterránea: tomillo,
salvia, orgaza, arbustos y árboles dispersos, como olivos o algarrobos. También hay bastantes
pitas (ágapes) y
chumbos (cactus), introducidos en España desde México. Es un
hermoso paraje capaz de inspirar por igual tanto a los visitantes como a los
residentes.
OTRAS FORMAS DE AYUDARNOS
En estos
tiempos de incertidumbre política, ecológica y social,
sentimos que es más importante que nunca asegurarnos de que la sostenibilidad, la
permacultura, la comunidad y las energías limpias son una prioridad destacada en la
agenda privada de cada uno. ¿Puedes ayudarnos a lograr esto y crear un futuro sostenible?
Hasta donde
sabemos, somos el único proyecto educativo en Europa con un enfoque práctica que investiga
la desertificación y otras amenazas medioambientales. En este momento necesitamos
fondos para asegurar la continuidad de nuestra importante labor y que las
futuras generaciones de voluntarios puedan beneficiarse de los programas de
aprendizaje que ofrecemos, únicos en su clase.

<div>
<br/><div><ul>
<li>By developing <b>Biochar production systems</b>, placed in our communities, that generating income for local businesses<br/>
</li>
<li>Creating jobs by processing waste into valuable products<br/>
</li>

<br/>
</div>
<div><b>Key Benefits of Biochar in the Soil:</b></div>
<div><ol>
<li>Increases <b>water retention in the soil</b> - for each <b>1% Biochar </b>added to 1000 kg of sandy soil, <b>250 kg of water</b> can be captured and slowly released for up to 30 days in the soil</li>
<li>Increased <b>nutrient retention in the soil</b> - <b>10 - 20%</b> of organic / chemical <b>fertilizer </b>can be <b>replaced with Biochar</b> increasing the availability and effectivity of the remaining 80 - 90% in the soil. With the addition of Biochar, Soil fertilizers are <b>not easily washed out</b> of the soils making it available to plants.</li>
<li>Soil <b>microbes</b> - <b>the life of the soil</b> - loves Biochar, making it their preferred home!</li>
<li>
<b>Biochar increases plant growth up to 51%</b> while reducing fertilizing requirements up to 50% for certain crops.</li>

<div><b>What is Biochar?</b></div>
<div>
BioChar is a natural, organic based, carbon product obtained from the carbonisation of various forms of Biomass.  These forms include by-products of plant extracts, wood waste, crop residues, and green waste.<br/>

</div>
<div>BioChar is applied to the soil to enhance water and nutrient holding capacity. It provides a home for microbial life in the soil, boosting food security through soil health, and improving green growth. The application of BioChar to agriculture can increase crop production by up to 51% while lowering chemical fertilizing requirements by 50%.<br/>

Biochar is a powerful tool that can be used to fight global warming by creating a carbon negative cycle through Carbon Sequestration. Each 1 ton of Biochar put back into the soil has the potential to sequester ±3.5 tons of CO2 from the atmosphere.<br/>

<p>Normal carbon sequestration by photosynthesis is Carbon neutral, which means that all the carbon dioxide (CO2) being captured by trees and plants is released back into the atmosphere during the decomposition process.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Biochar sequestration is achieved using the process of pyrolysis to produce a beneficial, solid, organic based carbon, that can be stored in the soil for up to 1000 years, thus decreasing the carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere.</p>

<p><b>How does NewCarbon's technology work?</b></p>
<div>The NewCarbon technology converts biomass waste into valuable BioChar through the process of pyrolysis.  Pyrolysis is the process of transforming Biomass, by a thermo-chemical process, into valuable products that include Syngas, Bio-Oils and Biochar.<span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span>

<div>NewCarbon’s technology is unique. Energy from syngas and bio-oil is used to dry and convert the biomass to BioChar, and power the machine. The control and monitoring system is powered by solar energy. The clean-burn product gas from NewCarbon's technology is ideal for stimulating growth in greenhouses, where a further carbon sink is created<span style=""background-color: initial;"">.</span>

Climate change variability and over use of chemical fertilizers in our soils, coupled with destructive farming practices, have caused extensive degradation of agricultural soil and forest land.  There is an increase in scarcity and contamination of our water resources, and major pollution of the earths' atmosphere. Numerous examples exist across the globe.










What if there was an innovative, carbon negative, and sustainable way to bring new life back into our soil and water systems, using only Biomass waste, which profits the environment and our communities?







Terra preta - 2000 year old practice

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia




Terra preta (Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈtɛʁɐ ˈpɾetɐ], locally [ˈtɛhɐ ˈpɾetɐ], literally ""black earth"" or ""black land"" in Portuguese) is a type of very dark, fertile anthropogenic soil found in the Amazon Basin. Terra preta owes its name to its very high charcoal content, and was made by adding a mixture of charcoal, bone, and manure to the otherwise relatively infertile Amazonian soil. It is very stable and remains in the soil for thousands of years.[1][2] It is also known as ""Amazonian dark earth"" or ""Indian black earth"".








After discovering this amazing soil, we started finding ways to re-introduce Terra Preta through the production and application of Biochar:



By developing Biochar production systems, placed in our communities, that generating income for local businesses

Creating jobs by processing waste into valuable products

Producing Biochar that is used by the local farming community to enhance the soil, purify water, and increase retention of nutrients in the soil

Helping local farmers produce greater, and healthier crops







Key Benefits of Biochar in the Soil:

Increases water retention in the soil - for each 1% Biochar added to 1000 kg of sandy soil, 250 kg of water can be captured and slowly released for up to 30 days in the soil
Increased nutrient retention in the soil - 10 - 20% of organic / chemical fertilizer can be replaced with Biochar increasing the availability and effectivity of the remaining 80 - 90% in the soil. With the addition of Biochar, Soil fertilizers are not easily washed out of the soils making it available to plants.
Soil microbes - the life of the soil - loves Biochar, making it their preferred home!

Biochar increases plant growth up to 51% while reducing fertilizing requirements up to 50% for certain crops.











Why are we crowdfunding?


With this campaign we want to raise awareness of Biochar, our technology, and gain your support to complete the construction of the first NewCarbon Prototype and run our first production and testing campaigns.

The information gained from our Research and Development work, using the NewCarbon Prototype, will be used to develop specific environmental-socio-economic projects within our poorer communities. We aim to have our first community project up and running towards the later part of 2015.

Our crowdfunding dream: we would like 5,000 crowdfunding backers to help us revolutionize our way of living.  We need you to join us! With your support we will reach our fundraising goal of $50,000.



Please consider to help us help our local charity orginisation by selecting the FRESH START perk, where 90% of your generous contribution will be donated to them. Please visit http://www.freshstart.org.za/ to find out more. In the meantime, we'd love you to continue reading...



Please check out the great perks* we have prepared to express our gratitude, and join the NewCarbon revolution by supporting us. Help us realize the dream to revitalize life through the production and application of Biochar.


Here are some examples of our great perks. To see the full range please scroll to the bottom.







NewCarbon Innovation

NewCarbon has been developing innovative ways to modernize a 2000 year-old practice by producing BioChar in a novel, clean, and cost effective way using only biomass waste and solar energy.








BioChar is a powerful tool that can be used to fight climate change, increase the health of our soils, and purify water thereby boosting food and water security.






What is Biochar?

BioChar is a natural, organic based, carbon product obtained from the carbonisation of various forms of Biomass.  These forms include by-products of plant extracts, wood waste, crop residues, and green waste.








BioChar is applied to the soil to enhance water and nutrient holding capacity. It provides a home for microbial life in the soil, boosting food security through soil health, and improving green growth. The application of BioChar to agriculture can increase crop production by up to 51% while lowering chemical fertilizing requirements by 50%.






Biochar is a powerful tool that can be used to fight global warming by creating a carbon negative cycle through Carbon Sequestration. Each 1 ton of Biochar put back into the soil has the potential to sequester ±3.5 tons of CO2 from the atmosphere.






* pictures from the International Biochar Initiative (IBI).

Normal carbon sequestration by photosynthesis is Carbon neutral, which means that all the carbon dioxide (CO2) being captured by trees and plants is released back into the atmosphere during the decomposition process.

Biochar sequestration is achieved using the process of pyrolysis to produce a beneficial, solid, organic based carbon, that can be stored in the soil for up to 1000 years, thus decreasing the carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere.





How does NewCarbon's technology work?
The NewCarbon technology converts biomass waste into valuable BioChar through the process of pyrolysis.  Pyrolysis is the process of transforming Biomass, by a thermo-chemical process, into valuable products that include Syngas, Bio-Oils and Biochar. 




NewCarbon’s technology is unique. Energy from syngas and bio-oil is used to dry and convert the biomass to BioChar, and power the machine. The control and monitoring system is powered by solar energy. The clean-burn product gas from NewCarbon's technology is ideal for stimulating growth in greenhouses, where a further carbon sink is created.







What do we aim to achieve with NewCarbon's technology?

From our research into Biochar production technologies and application opportunities, it became apparent that a clean, low-tech, low-cost, semi-mobile, self-sustaining technology was required.

The capacity to process between 1 and 5 tons of Biomass per hour, and the ability to place the operation anywhere where there is a biomass waste source, proved to be critical for the economic viability of Biochar production and use.

NewCarbon technology enables the creation of a renewing lifecycle, continuously increasing the health of the planet through restoration of food and water systems.



This NewCarbon technology will enable the cost effective production of Biochar on a  scale small enough to be run as a local business unit, and large enough to make a substantial impact on local agriculture and communities.






What's been achieved so far?
From September 2014, when the value of Biochar dawned on us, we have been investing our time, money, and energy into:




General research of the world-wide Biochar industry, type of feedstock, processes, products, and potential markets - Sept to Nov 2014
Process design and conceptualizing of the NewCarbon technology - Oct to Nov 2014
Concept development and testing - Nov and Dec 2014
Preparation and testing of various feedstock - Nov and Dec 2014
Technology scouting, and commercialization potential - Dec / Jan 2015

Prototype design and construction - Feb to June 2015
Project development planning, and fundraising - April to June 2015








What is the plan for the immediate future?
We're at a critical point in the development process. We have prepared and cast a strong foundation for the NewCarbon Prototype, metaphorically and physically speaking, and now need you to help us complete the construction.








Our plan for the immediate future includes:




Complete the construction of the 1 ton per hour NewCarbon Prototype - June to July 2015
The first Biochar produced will be used for applied research at the University of Fort Hare, Eastern Cape, South Africa titled ""The use of Biochar in Rural Community Development and Agriculture"" - July to December 2015
Test the NewCarbon Prototype performance with readily available feedstock with various properties e.g. sizes, shapes, moisture content
Evaluate the NewCarbon Prototype durability, and identify design optimization opportunities
Test various feedstock materials in the NewCarbon Prototype, for example saw mill biomass waste, invader species, and poultry farm bio-waste
Benchmark the NewCarbon Prototype against similar production units across the globe
Production testing of NewCarbon Prototype for commercial roll-out
Process and design optimization of NewCarbon Prototype for commercial roll-out
Business Plan set-up and development for commercial roll-out











Achieving these goals, with your help, will be a major achievement for all of us.



The project will advance the global strategy of moving towards a lower-carbon economy, and:


create new jobs,
stimulate growth,
promote science and innovation partnerships,
develop skills and expertise,
provide a focus opportunity for environmental reform,
boost food security,
build science and technology capacity, and

address the challenges of climate change.

</div><div>
<p><b>Problems at the Salton Sea: </b></p>
<p>In the last thirty years, Salton Sea has been a well known problematic spot in southern California.
Eutrophication used to be the only problem in the sea causing concerns of
deteriorated water quality and damaged environment for the locals. However,
over the years more problems have developed, such as high salt concentrations
and a shrinking water supply. As the sea continues to dry up, the dust created
by the exposed seabed sediment can be carried away in windy conditions and
spread across southern California. The majority of the fine dust particles
measure less than 10 microns in diameter and have already been targeted as the
main culprit behind increased occurrences of respiratory system diseases of
children in the Coachella and Imperial Valley. Any large-scale dust storms in
the future are of great health concern to not only Southern California, but
expanding to regions in Arizona, Nevada and Mexico. </p>
</div><div><br/></div><h3>Technical Study Description: </h3><div><br/></div><p>The
extreme degradation of the Salton Sea can be directly attributed to the
eutrophication of the aquatic ecosystem. A body of water is considered to be of
eutrophic status when nutrients such nitrogen and phosphorous are elevated
beyond their natural levels.  As a result
of the excess nutrients in the system, opportunistic species such as algae can
leave a wake of problems if left uncontrolled. As algae growth takes over on the
surface, an increased amount of algal biomass enters the ecosystem. As algal
cells naturally die off, the aerobic bacteria involved in the decomposition process
must consume an increased amount of dissolved oxygen. As oxygen is depleted
below the surface of the water, a hypoxic environment is created and fish begin
to die off. The Salton Sea has known “dead zones” in which anaerobic bacteria
thrive on the high amount of decaying detrital biomass and produce smelly
hydrogen sulfide gas as a byproduct. The nutrient in-flow to the sea has been
occurring since the sea was formed more than one hundred years ago, and has
never had any source of nutrient out-flow. Establishing a nutrient extraction
mechanism is the key to the decontamination of the waters. For many years, the
restoration of the Salton Sea has been focused on eliminating the nutrient
in-flow, however this has failed to be an effective method to remove the
nutrients. Our team is proposing to both effectively remove nutrients from the
drainage water leading to the sea , as well as to utilize the extracted
nutrients as a raw material for a second series of production through
aquaculture and agriculture. With the future commercial expansion we will also
remove nutrients for the Salton Sea itself to reuse the nutrients for algae
harvesting and biomass processing as an income stream. </p>
<p>To
create an outflow of nutrients, it is necessary to determine the point at which
eutrophication occurs and what variables can be removed. Nutrients cycle
through the food chain from producers to consumers, and are then made available
to the producers again through decomposition. The inorganic nutrients nitrogen
and phosphorous in an aquatic ecosystem will be consumed by the primary
producers such as algae and other plants. In turn, algae and plant populations
are then controlled by primary consumers such as fish, shrimp and clams. Fish,
shrimp, and clam populations are then controlled by secondary consumers such as
animals and humans. This is how nutrients are removed from the aquatic
ecosystem and flow into the regional food chain. Animal and human waste (in the
form of waste water treatment plant effluent) is then degraded by bacteria and
nutrients are stored in the soil. Rainwater will carry these nutrients back to
the waterway to start a new cycle. In the case of eutrophication, the nutrient
in-flow exceeds the consumption capacity of regular algae. The excess nutrients
promote an abrupt and unhealthy growth of algae in the system. If marine animals
cannot deplete the algal cells, for any reason, bacteria will flourish on the
debris of algal cells. The rapid growth of bacteria exhausts the dissolved
oxygen in water and suffocates all plants and animals in the water forming the
“dead zone.”  The only survivors in a
“dead zone” are anaerobic bacteria, which release the rotten smelling gasses.</p>
<p>To
prevent eutrophication requires slowing down the nutrient in-flow or
accelerating the nutrient out-flow. By removing the algae, or the food source
of the aerobic bacteria, the aerobic bacteria will then become a variable that
can be removed or controlled. By harvesting the flourishing algae, the
oxygen-depleting aerobic bacteria, or even the smelly anaerobic bacteria, the
progression of eutrophication can be stopped at any of these stages by creating
an outflow for the excess nutrients. For example, the removal of nutrients
could prevent algae growth, which stops eutrophication from starting. This
removal of algal biomass could cut off the food supply for aerobic bacteria
preserving dissolved oxygen for aquatic life and saving the environment.
Controlling the aerobic bacteria will in turn maintain the growth of anaerobic
bacteria, stopping further deterioration of the ecosystem. In practice,
removing nutrients can only be achieved by harvesting the algae and limiting
the bacteria growth. If the right technology is adopted, both of these goals
can be completed in one procedure.</p>

Waste Water Treatment systems can create water abundance in arid climates through reclamation treatment. Algae Cultivation can be used for carbon sequestration, biofuel production and bio plastics. Our primary goal is focused on job creation and environmental revitalization with large scale climate adaptation opportunities. These are the first steps in true climate action with a small price tag which utilizes biomimicry.
""Professional management, for a better
environment""
Every contribution makes a difference and every dollar counts. If every person in Southern California gave one dollar we could use $22,000,000  to clean all the water inlets at the Salton Sea and the majority of the water in the sea.    If every person in the USA gave one dollar we could use $319,000,000 to help Clean all of the major waterways in the USA, as well as the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.  If every person in the world a gave one dollar we could use $7,125,000,000 to help clean all of the major polluted waterways and oceans around the world.
Our Mission: 
 To
develop and implement proven ideas at the Salton Sea. Our goal is to
help solve the problems surrounding the sea by combining various innovative
technologies. By utilizing a project management background, AGESS will help
coordinate the multitude of technological efforts required to preventenvironmental
degradation. By integrating these systems, we will be able to create a
self sustaining revitalized sea, ultimately restoring the environment
ecology and economy. 
Current
Focuses: Provide solutions to nutrient pollution and
carbon sequestration at the Salton Sea. Strategies include habitat restoration, salt water agriculture and aquaculture implementation

Problems at the Salton Sea: 
In the last thirty years, Salton Sea has been a well known problematic spot in southern California.
Eutrophication used to be the only problem in the sea causing concerns of
deteriorated water quality and damaged environment for the locals. However,
over the years more problems have developed, such as high salt concentrations
and a shrinking water supply. As the sea continues to dry up, the dust created
by the exposed seabed sediment can be carried away in windy conditions and
spread across southern California. The majority of the fine dust particles
measure less than 10 microns in diameter and have already been targeted as the
main culprit behind increased occurrences of respiratory system diseases of
children in the Coachella and Imperial Valley. Any large-scale dust storms in
the future are of great health concern to not only Southern California, but
expanding to regions in Arizona, Nevada and Mexico. 
Technical Study Description: The
extreme degradation of the Salton Sea can be directly attributed to the
eutrophication of the aquatic ecosystem. A body of water is considered to be of
eutrophic status when nutrients such nitrogen and phosphorous are elevated
beyond their natural levels.  As a result
of the excess nutrients in the system, opportunistic species such as algae can
leave a wake of problems if left uncontrolled. As algae growth takes over on the
surface, an increased amount of algal biomass enters the ecosystem. As algal
cells naturally die off, the aerobic bacteria involved in the decomposition process
must consume an increased amount of dissolved oxygen. As oxygen is depleted
below the surface of the water, a hypoxic environment is created and fish begin
to die off. The Salton Sea has known “dead zones” in which anaerobic bacteria
thrive on the high amount of decaying detrital biomass and produce smelly
hydrogen sulfide gas as a byproduct. The nutrient in-flow to the sea has been
occurring since the sea was formed more than one hundred years ago, and has
never had any source of nutrient out-flow. Establishing a nutrient extraction
mechanism is the key to the decontamination of the waters. For many years, the
restoration of the Salton Sea has been focused on eliminating the nutrient
in-flow, however this has failed to be an effective method to remove the
nutrients. Our team is proposing to both effectively remove nutrients from the
drainage water leading to the sea , as well as to utilize the extracted
nutrients as a raw material for a second series of production through
aquaculture and agriculture. With the future commercial expansion we will also
remove nutrients for the Salton Sea itself to reuse the nutrients for algae
harvesting and biomass processing as an income stream. 
To
create an outflow of nutrients, it is necessary to determine the point at which
eutrophication occurs and what variables can be removed. Nutrients cycle
through the food chain from producers to consumers, and are then made available
to the producers again through decomposition. The inorganic nutrients nitrogen
and phosphorous in an aquatic ecosystem will be consumed by the primary
producers such as algae and other plants. In turn, algae and plant populations
are then controlled by primary consumers such as fish, shrimp and clams. Fish,
shrimp, and clam populations are then controlled by secondary consumers such as
animals and humans. This is how nutrients are removed from the aquatic
ecosystem and flow into the regional food chain. Animal and human waste (in the
form of waste water treatment plant effluent) is then degraded by bacteria and
nutrients are stored in the soil. Rainwater will carry these nutrients back to
the waterway to start a new cycle. In the case of eutrophication, the nutrient
in-flow exceeds the consumption capacity of regular algae. The excess nutrients
promote an abrupt and unhealthy growth of algae in the system. If marine animals
cannot deplete the algal cells, for any reason, bacteria will flourish on the
debris of algal cells. The rapid growth of bacteria exhausts the dissolved
oxygen in water and suffocates all plants and animals in the water forming the
“dead zone.”  The only survivors in a
“dead zone” are anaerobic bacteria, which release the rotten smelling gasses.
To
prevent eutrophication requires slowing down the nutrient in-flow or
accelerating the nutrient out-flow. By removing the algae, or the food source
of the aerobic bacteria, the aerobic bacteria will then become a variable that
can be removed or controlled. By harvesting the flourishing algae, the
oxygen-depleting aerobic bacteria, or even the smelly anaerobic bacteria, the
progression of eutrophication can be stopped at any of these stages by creating
an outflow for the excess nutrients. For example, the removal of nutrients
could prevent algae growth, which stops eutrophication from starting. This
removal of algal biomass could cut off the food supply for aerobic bacteria
preserving dissolved oxygen for aquatic life and saving the environment.
Controlling the aerobic bacteria will in turn maintain the growth of anaerobic
bacteria, stopping further deterioration of the ecosystem. In practice,
removing nutrients can only be achieved by harvesting the algae and limiting
the bacteria growth. If the right technology is adopted, both of these goals
can be completed in one procedure.

Fishing for Microplastic about?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The project will provide insight into
the microplastic pollution in one of the last mostly untouched regions on
Earth, the Mergui Archipelago. Our overall goal is to find out how much this
pristine ecosystem in a remote area is affected by plastic pollution. We will
take samples on beaches and from the water surface and determine the amount and
composition of debris items. Also, we will examine stomach contents of fish in
cooperation with local fishermen in order to assess the number of fish that
mistake plastic pieces for food. Those particles will undergo a detailed
analysis in the lab using Raman and/or FTIR spectroscopy. Additionally, we will
undertake visual surveys of the sea floor for larger debris and document
animals that got entangled in marine litter.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Where
is the Mergui Archipelago and what is so special about it?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Mergui Archipelago in the
Andaman Sea comprises about 800 islands belonging to Myanmar. It is
characterized by an extensive coral reef system, wide sea grass beds and
beautiful mangrove forests forming an ecosystem with an outstanding
biodiversity. These characteristics have led <a href=""http://mission-blue.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mission Blue</a> to designating the Mergui
Archipelago as one of their Hope Spots – “places that are critical to the

extent the Mergui Archipelago is naturally protected by its virtual isolation.
However, global influences like climate change or ocean acidification cannot be
kept away from those islands. This is also true for anthropogenic debris. Even
if the debris sources are thousands of kilometers away, the ocean currents will
transport the remains of human activity in every corner of the world.</p>

should you care about our oceans?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The answer is quite simple. Every drop
of water we drink and every other molecule of oxygen we breathe have their
origin in the ocean. Without healthy oceans humankind and almost all other
species will not be able to survive. Realizing that is essential.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Want to
know more?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Already, a minimum estimate of 5.25
trillion (!!) plastic pieces are floating in our oceans: from microbeads, found
in cosmetics, to plastic bags and large items like containers and derelict
fishing gear; from the North and South Pacific Oceans to the Atlantic and
Indian Oceans and the Mediterranean Sea. And those trillions of plastic pieces
are only the visible ones on the water surface. 
Some even presume that there may be six times more plastic floating in
the oceans than plankton.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The plastic fragments themselves already
impose great threats to marine creatures. Sea turtles ingest plastic bags,
whales get entangled in derelict fishing gear, sea bird chicks starve to death
with a stomach full of plastic particles, only to name a few examples. 
Every year, hundreds of thousands marine animals die from
eating plastic. <span><br/></span>The
indirect danger, also for human health, is the ability of plastic to adsorb
chemical pollutants (e.g. pesticides) and release them along with plasticizers
and flame retardants when ingested. Once eaten and released in the tissue of an
animal, the chemicals work their way up the food chain and eventually land with
the tuna, swordfish, salmon or cod on our plates.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Sadly, there are many problems our
oceans are struggling with – global warming leading to acidification, noise
pollution, overfishing, chemical pollutants. Anthropogenic plastic pollution is
one that reached public attention only recently. Hopefully not too
late... </p>

<p><b>Über mich</b></p>
<p>Mein Name ist Julia Hager und ich bin Meeresbiologin. Ab Dezember
diesen Jahres habe ich die Gelegenheit, das Projekt „Fishing for Microplastic“
zu leiten als Teil des <a href=""http://www.projectmanaia.at/MABR/MABR/Project.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mergui Archipelago Biodiversity Research</a> Teams in der
Andamanen See vor Myanmar.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Worum geht es bei Fishing for
Microplastic?</b></p>
<p>Das Projekt wird Einblicke in die Mikroplastik-Verschmutzung liefern in
einer der letzten fast unberührten Regionen der Erde, dem Mergui Archipel.
Unser Ziel ist es, herauszufinden wie groß die Auswirkungen von marinem
Plastikmüll auf dieses ursprüngliche Ökosystem sind. Um die Menge und
Zusammensetzung der Plastikpartikel zu bestimmen, werden wir Proben an den
Stränden und der Wasseroberfläche nehmen. Außerdem werden wir in Zusammenarbeit
mit einheimischen Fischern den Mageninhalt von Fischen auf Mikroplastikpartikel
untersuchen. Die gefundenen Partikel werden wir dann im Labor mit Raman
und/oder FTIR Spektroskopen detailliert analysieren. Ebenso soll größerer
anthropogener Müll am Meeresboden erfasst werden sowie Tiere, die sich z.B. in
Leinen oder Netzen verfangen haben.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Wo ist der Mergui Archipel
und warum ist dieser so besonders?</b></p>
<p>Der Mergui Archipel in der Andamanen See umfasst mehr als 800 Inseln
und gehört zu Myanmar, dem früheren Burma. Ausgedehnte Korallenriffe, weite
Seegraswiesen und herrliche Mangrovenwälder formen ein Ökosystem mit einer
herausragenden Biodiversität. Diese Merkmale haben <a href=""http://mission-blue.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mission Blue</a> veranlasst, den
Mergui Archipel als einer ihrer „Hope Spots“ zu nominieren – „Gebiete, die
entscheidend sind für die Gesundheit der Ozeane“. Darüber hinaus hat die UNESCO
die Region ihrer Liste als mögliches Weltnaturerbe hinzugefügt.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Weshalb die Forschung in einer
abgeschiedenen, fast unbewohnten Region?</b></p>
<p>Das Mergui Archipelago Biodiversity Research Projekt bietet die
einzigartige Gelegenheit, ein ursprüngliches und weitgehend unberührtes Gebiet
zu erforschen. Es ist einer der letzten Orte mit nahezu intakten Ökosystemen
und einer außergewöhnlichen Artenvielfalt, die die Grundlage für Nahrung und
Sauerstoffproduktion bilden. Solche Regionen mit blühendem Leben zeigen, wie
Ökosysteme sich entwickeln und funktionieren ohne den Einfluss des Menschen.
Durch seine scheinbare Isolation ist der Mergui Archipel zu einem gewissen Grad
natürlicherweise geschützt. Globale Auswirkungen wie die anthropogene
Verschmutzung können jedoch ebenso wenig von diesen Inseln ferngehalten werden
wie der Klimawandel oder die Versauerung der Ozeane. Auch wenn die Quellen der
Verschmutzung tausende Kilometer entfernt liegen – die Hinterlassenschaften des
Menschen werden von den Meeresströmungen in jeden Winkel der Erde
transportiert.</p>

<p>Die Antwort ist ganz einfach. Jeder Tropfen Wasser, den wir trinken und

<p>Eine minimale Schätzung ergab, dass bereits heute 5,25 Billionen (!!)
Plastikpartikel in unseren Meeren schwimmen: von Mikrokügelchen, die in
Kosmetik verwendet werden, zu Plastiktüten und größeren Teilen, wie Flaschen,
Behälter und alten Fischernetzen und –leinen; vom Nord- und Südpazifik zum
Atlantischen und Indischen Ozean und dem Mittelmeer. Und diese Schätzung
umfasst nur diejenigen Partikel, die sichtbar an der Wasseroberfläche
schwimmen. Es wird sogar angenommen, dass mittlerweile sechsmal mehr Plastik in
den Ozeanen treibt als Plankton.</p>
<p>Die Plastikfragmente an sich stellen bereits eine große Gefahr für die
Lebewesen im Meer dar: Meeresschildkröten verwechseln Plastiktüten mit Quallen,
Wale verfangen sich in alten Netzen und Leinen, die Küken der Seevögel
verhungern mit einem Bauch voll von Plastikteilchen, nur um ein paar Beispiele
zu nennen. Jedes Jahr verenden hunderttausende Meerestiere, weil sie
versehentlich Plastik gefressen haben. Die indirekte Gefahr jedoch, auch für
die Gesundheit des Menschen, besteht in der Fähigkeit des Plastiks, Schadstoffe
(z.B. Pestizide) aus der Umgebung zu adsorbieren und diese zusammen mit
Weichmachern und Flammschutzmitteln im Inneren von Tieren wieder abzugeben.
Sind die mit Giftstoffen beladenen Plastikteilchen einmal verspeist und haben
die Schadstoffe ihren Weg ins Gewebe gefunden, arbeiten sie sich über die
Nahrungskette nach oben voran und landen früher oder später mit dem Thunfisch,
Schwertfisch, Lachs oder Kabeljau auch auf unseren Tellern.</p>
<p>Leider gibt es sehr viele Probleme, mit denen unsere Ozeane kämpfen
müssen – globale Erwärmung, die zur Versauerung führt, Lärmverschmutzung,
Überfischung, schädliche Chemikalien. Anthropogene Verschmutzung durch Plastik
hat erst vor kurzem öffentliche Aufmerksamkeit erlangt. Hoffentlich noch nicht

Who I
am
My name is Julia Hager and I am a marine
biologist. Starting this coming December, I will have the opportunity to
lead the project Fishing for Microplastic as part of the Mergui Archipelago Biodiversity Research team in the Andaman Sea off Myanmar for the winter season.

What is
Fishing for Microplastic about?
The project will provide insight into
the microplastic pollution in one of the last mostly untouched regions on
Earth, the Mergui Archipelago. Our overall goal is to find out how much this
pristine ecosystem in a remote area is affected by plastic pollution. We will
take samples on beaches and from the water surface and determine the amount and
composition of debris items. Also, we will examine stomach contents of fish in
cooperation with local fishermen in order to assess the number of fish that
mistake plastic pieces for food. Those particles will undergo a detailed
analysis in the lab using Raman and/or FTIR spectroscopy. Additionally, we will
undertake visual surveys of the sea floor for larger debris and document
animals that got entangled in marine litter.
Where
is the Mergui Archipelago and what is so special about it?
The Mergui Archipelago in the
Andaman Sea comprises about 800 islands belonging to Myanmar. It is
characterized by an extensive coral reef system, wide sea grass beds and
beautiful mangrove forests forming an ecosystem with an outstanding
biodiversity. These characteristics have led Mission Blue to designating the Mergui
Archipelago as one of their Hope Spots – “places that are critical to the
health of the ocean”. Furthermore, the UNESCO nominated the region as
candidate for a World Heritage Site.
Our work will provide valuable data and
might help in the UNESCO evaluation process.

Why
doing research in a remote, mostly uninhabited place?
The Mergui Archipelago Biodiversity
Research project offers the unique opportunity to explore a pristine, largely
undisturbed region. It is one of the last spots with near-intact ecosystems and
a rich biodiversity providing food and oxygen. Life advances in those places
that show how ecosystems develop and function without human influence. To some
extent the Mergui Archipelago is naturally protected by its virtual isolation.
However, global influences like climate change or ocean acidification cannot be
kept away from those islands. This is also true for anthropogenic debris. Even
if the debris sources are thousands of kilometers away, the ocean currents will
transport the remains of human activity in every corner of the world.
Our
expedition platform
Sea Nomad, a sail catamaran designed for
research will serve as platform for our project. The scientific equipment
includes plankton nets and various other sampling devices, a sonar, a
microscope, a refractometer, DSLR cameras, underwater housings and more.
Why
should you care about our oceans?
The answer is quite simple. Every drop
of water we drink and every other molecule of oxygen we breathe have their
origin in the ocean. Without healthy oceans humankind and almost all other
species will not be able to survive. Realizing that is essential.
Want to
know more?
Already, a minimum estimate of 5.25
trillion (!!) plastic pieces are floating in our oceans: from microbeads, found
in cosmetics, to plastic bags and large items like containers and derelict
fishing gear; from the North and South Pacific Oceans to the Atlantic and
Indian Oceans and the Mediterranean Sea. And those trillions of plastic pieces
are only the visible ones on the water surface. 
Some even presume that there may be six times more plastic floating in
the oceans than plankton.
The plastic fragments themselves already
impose great threats to marine creatures. Sea turtles ingest plastic bags,
whales get entangled in derelict fishing gear, sea bird chicks starve to death
with a stomach full of plastic particles, only to name a few examples. 
Every year, hundreds of thousands marine animals die from
eating plastic. The
indirect danger, also for human health, is the ability of plastic to adsorb
chemical pollutants (e.g. pesticides) and release them along with plasticizers
and flame retardants when ingested. Once eaten and released in the tissue of an
animal, the chemicals work their way up the food chain and eventually land with
the tuna, swordfish, salmon or cod on our plates.
Sadly, there are many problems our
oceans are struggling with – global warming leading to acidification, noise
pollution, overfishing, chemical pollutants. Anthropogenic plastic pollution is
one that reached public attention only recently. Hopefully not too
late... 
Where
the funds go
Seagoing scientific expeditions are
always a financial challenge due to maintenance costs of the boat and
scientific equipment. Travel expenses and regional fees are adding to the
overall costs.
Your donation will help cover the costs for
the 2015/2016 season for the following items:
-  expedition-  sampling
gear (nets, test sieves)-  USB microscope-  analytical
scale-  other
equipment (sample tubes, containers, …)-  traveling-  visa
& regional fees
What if I can’t donate?
No
worries, there is a way how you can still help. Just spread the word and share
this campaign among your friends or coworkers. That will make a big difference.
Last but not least…
In
whatever way you help I am very thankful for your contribution! I hope you
understand that there are no perks for your donation as I dedicate every donated
cent to the project. But make sure to check back for news and pictures!

Über mich
Mein Name ist Julia Hager und ich bin Meeresbiologin. Ab Dezember
diesen Jahres habe ich die Gelegenheit, das Projekt „Fishing for Microplastic“
zu leiten als Teil des Mergui Archipelago Biodiversity Research Teams in der
Andamanen See vor Myanmar.

Worum geht es bei Fishing for
Microplastic?
Das Projekt wird Einblicke in die Mikroplastik-Verschmutzung liefern in
einer der letzten fast unberührten Regionen der Erde, dem Mergui Archipel.
Unser Ziel ist es, herauszufinden wie groß die Auswirkungen von marinem
Plastikmüll auf dieses ursprüngliche Ökosystem sind. Um die Menge und
Zusammensetzung der Plastikpartikel zu bestimmen, werden wir Proben an den
Stränden und der Wasseroberfläche nehmen. Außerdem werden wir in Zusammenarbeit
mit einheimischen Fischern den Mageninhalt von Fischen auf Mikroplastikpartikel
untersuchen. Die gefundenen Partikel werden wir dann im Labor mit Raman
und/oder FTIR Spektroskopen detailliert analysieren. Ebenso soll größerer
anthropogener Müll am Meeresboden erfasst werden sowie Tiere, die sich z.B. in
Leinen oder Netzen verfangen haben.

Wo ist der Mergui Archipel
und warum ist dieser so besonders?
Der Mergui Archipel in der Andamanen See umfasst mehr als 800 Inseln
und gehört zu Myanmar, dem früheren Burma. Ausgedehnte Korallenriffe, weite
Seegraswiesen und herrliche Mangrovenwälder formen ein Ökosystem mit einer
herausragenden Biodiversität. Diese Merkmale haben Mission Blue veranlasst, den
Mergui Archipel als einer ihrer „Hope Spots“ zu nominieren – „Gebiete, die
entscheidend sind für die Gesundheit der Ozeane“. Darüber hinaus hat die UNESCO
die Region ihrer Liste als mögliches Weltnaturerbe hinzugefügt.

Weshalb die Forschung in einer
abgeschiedenen, fast unbewohnten Region?
Das Mergui Archipelago Biodiversity Research Projekt bietet die
einzigartige Gelegenheit, ein ursprüngliches und weitgehend unberührtes Gebiet
zu erforschen. Es ist einer der letzten Orte mit nahezu intakten Ökosystemen
und einer außergewöhnlichen Artenvielfalt, die die Grundlage für Nahrung und
Sauerstoffproduktion bilden. Solche Regionen mit blühendem Leben zeigen, wie
Ökosysteme sich entwickeln und funktionieren ohne den Einfluss des Menschen.
Durch seine scheinbare Isolation ist der Mergui Archipel zu einem gewissen Grad
natürlicherweise geschützt. Globale Auswirkungen wie die anthropogene
Verschmutzung können jedoch ebenso wenig von diesen Inseln ferngehalten werden
wie der Klimawandel oder die Versauerung der Ozeane. Auch wenn die Quellen der
Verschmutzung tausende Kilometer entfernt liegen – die Hinterlassenschaften des
Menschen werden von den Meeresströmungen in jeden Winkel der Erde
transportiert.

Unsere Expeditionsplattform
SeaNomad, ein Segelkatamaran, der speziell für Forschungszwecke
entworfen wurde, ist die Basis für unser Projekt. Die wissenschaftliche
Ausrüstung umfasst Planktonnetze und andere Probenahmegeräte, ein Sonar, ein
Mikroskop, ein Refraktometer, Spiegelreflexkameras mit Unterwassergehäuse und
mehr.

Warum sollten Sie sich für
das Wohlergehen unserer Meere interessieren?
Die Antwort ist ganz einfach. Jeder Tropfen Wasser, den wir trinken und
mehr als jedes zweite Sauerstoffmolekül, das wir einatmen haben ihren Ursprung
im Meer. Ohne gesunde Ozeane wird die Menschheit sowie fast alle anderen Arten
der Erde nicht überleben können. Dies zu erkennen ist essentiell.

Well it's here and Pineapple Tech is determined to get it to the world! Yet, we simply can't do it without your help! In 3-4 month HEAE (Formally Global Energy International) will be on Coast2Coast Am as a guest to present the product with no way to feed the masses! Pineapple Tech is taking on the burden; so time is of the essence, hence a 10 day fund raiser.



Before you make judgment, please
understand: THIS IS NOT ABOUT WEALTH… It’s about HEALTH,.. and the air our
children breathe on a daily basis. In Ohio and the surrounding States, they
continue to drill and Frac in order to get Natural Gas and Oil; yet continue to
charge us for Foreign Oil and in the mean while DESTROYING our planet! I know
this first hand due to being in the industry for 12 months and having inside
information on the danger they bring. I personally designed software
 to help
cut cost to the drilling/Fracing industry and our team decided money didn’t matter,
OUR
CHILDREN DO! So, Pineapple Tech went green by pulling our product, costing us
millions and believes in HEAE & Mr. Boyle’s dream by refusing to help BIG Energy’s quest to keep you dependent on their service!We now have purpose We can believe in!

Other companies I've launched:





Some successful, some not so much! Yet, always willing to help others meet their dreams.
We’ve looked at over 300-hydrogen web-sites, unable to find any tested by the US Government EPA or CARB. You wouldn’t buy a vehicle unless it passed the government crash test
 and other tests, so why on earth help fund a hydrogen system that hasn’t been
 tested by the government required and authorized testing agencies?!

<p>Together, if we can achieve even a small percentage reduction in waste, that would equate to millions of plastic bottles out of the race to choke our planet. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our target is to raise $3,000 in this fundraising campaign.</p>
<p>A big part of the money raised we hope will be from pre-sales of our PETLEASHES which we feel is so important because we would love for them to be used as soon as they are produced.</p>
<p>As soon as we raise the first $1,000, that will give us the confidence that you are interested and the product is indeed viable. At this point we will commence producing enough PETLEASHES to send out to our supporters.</p>

We are hoping that this Indiegogo bid will give us enough friends and contacts that we can bounce ideas off when it comes to approaching governments and authorities from a position of strength.
As an advertising person with over 40 years' experience making other people and businesses successful, I should be cocky and confident with this but I am not.
My biggest challenge is sales, a weakness that I have carried all my life, however, this time I believe with all my being that together we can make a huge difference and I am now prepared to break down any barriers.

The Arctic is our planet’s air conditioning system and has been regulating our climate for millions of years. But the Arctic is now warming faster than anywhere else on Earth and the stability of our climate hangs in the balance. The Elysium Artists for the Arctic project began as an epic expedition to our polar north in August of 2015 to inspire change. Drawing on the experience and passion of 66 team members from 19 different countries, we’re now ready to share the sights, sounds and science captured during the expedition to inspire the conservation of life at the top of the world through art, education and outreach. We need your support in our endeavor to share the splendor and fragility of the Arctic with the general public. Be part of the climate change solution with us.</p><p>The Elysium Artists for the Arctic team included the legendary Dr. Sylvia Earle, world-renowned photographers and artists such as David Doubilet, Ernie Brooks, Jennifer Hayes, Michael Aw, Eric Bettens, Leandro Blanco and Wyland. We started this project to show how the condition of the Arctic affects us all, and our ultimate goal is to send a strong message to our policy makers that we demand immediate, tangible action on climate change. Now.</p><p>We stand at a pivotal moment in history. Scientifically measurable effects of climate change are being experienced around the world, and many of us are witnessing these changes in our own backyards. Yet rather than using its immense influence to create positive changes in this regard, the new US administration banned the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as well as the Department of Agriculture from using social media to communicate scientific research to the public. Tweets regarding the carbon cycle were deleted off the National Park Service’s Twitter account. It has been rumored that the EPA has been asked to take down its internet page titled, “Climate Change”, and the administration has already requested a list of federal employees and contractors who have worked on different climate initiatives. In a world in which science is under attack and facts may have “alternatives”, it has never been more important or more urgent to mobilize our collective voices and fight for the future of our planet and our children.</p><p><i>“Illustrate it, write about it, photograph it, sketch it, paint it, sculpt it, go back with this body of work and present it to change people’s minds, attitudes and maybe behaviors.” – Jennifer Hayes</i></p><h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2><p>With your help, we will now be able to expand on the success of the Elysium expedition to bring the plight of climate change in the Arctic into the wider public awareness. With the images that have been presented so far as well as the upcoming release of the book and the movie, we are making progress toward getting our message out. You have been instrumental in supporting our cause. But it is not enough. Our real goal is to make a lasting impact on policy and decision makers who can help change the trajectory of the climate disaster that we are currently on.</p><p><i>“What’s happening is that as polar ice is melting away, so is the stability of the planet.” – Dr. Sylvia Earle</i></p><p>Our goal is to raise $20,000 in order to cover the production, venue, printing and advertising costs associated with bringing this project to the attention of the world. All funds collected will be used for this purpose, regardless of whether we reach our target goal amount.</p><p>Now in this next stage of the Elysium Arctic project we are making a call for support to help us share our vision far and wide. We are putting the finishing touches on the plans for the Elysium Artists for the Arctic exhibitions that will premiere in New York and Singapore on 23 March and 5 April, 2017 respectively. Through photos, paintings, sculptures, videos and music, these exhibitions will connect with people around the globe, changing their perception of this northern polar region so that they better comprehend the importance of the Arctic and why all of us must do everything in our power to protect it. </p><p><u>$20 Donation</u>: You will receive a one-year Ocean Geographic E-edition subscription and an invitation to preview the online Exhibition gallery on 20 March.  YES – you will be the first to see the exhibition!

The Arctic is our planet’s air conditioning system and has been regulating our climate for millions of years. But the Arctic is now warming faster than anywhere else on Earth and the stability of our climate hangs in the balance. The Elysium Artists for the Arctic project began as an epic expedition to our polar north in August of 2015 to inspire change. Drawing on the experience and passion of 66 team members from 19 different countries, we’re now ready to share the sights, sounds and science captured during the expedition to inspire the conservation of life at the top of the world through art, education and outreach. We need your support in our endeavor to share the splendor and fragility of the Arctic with the general public. Be part of the climate change solution with us.The Elysium Artists for the Arctic team included the legendary Dr. Sylvia Earle, world-renowned photographers and artists such as David Doubilet, Ernie Brooks, Jennifer Hayes, Michael Aw, Eric Bettens, Leandro Blanco and Wyland. We started this project to show how the condition of the Arctic affects us all, and our ultimate goal is to send a strong message to our policy makers that we demand immediate, tangible action on climate change. Now.We stand at a pivotal moment in history. Scientifically measurable effects of climate change are being experienced around the world, and many of us are witnessing these changes in our own backyards. Yet rather than using its immense influence to create positive changes in this regard, the new US administration banned the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as well as the Department of Agriculture from using social media to communicate scientific research to the public. Tweets regarding the carbon cycle were deleted off the National Park Service’s Twitter account. It has been rumored that the EPA has been asked to take down its internet page titled, “Climate Change”, and the administration has already requested a list of federal employees and contractors who have worked on different climate initiatives. In a world in which science is under attack and facts may have “alternatives”, it has never been more important or more urgent to mobilize our collective voices and fight for the future of our planet and our children.“Illustrate it, write about it, photograph it, sketch it, paint it, sculpt it, go back with this body of work and present it to change people’s minds, attitudes and maybe behaviors.” – Jennifer HayesWhat We Need & What You GetWith your help, we will now be able to expand on the success of the Elysium expedition to bring the plight of climate change in the Arctic into the wider public awareness. With the images that have been presented so far as well as the upcoming release of the book and the movie, we are making progress toward getting our message out. You have been instrumental in supporting our cause. But it is not enough. Our real goal is to make a lasting impact on policy and decision makers who can help change the trajectory of the climate disaster that we are currently on.“What’s happening is that as polar ice is melting away, so is the stability of the planet.” – Dr. Sylvia EarleOur goal is to raise $20,000 in order to cover the production, venue, printing and advertising costs associated with bringing this project to the attention of the world. All funds collected will be used for this purpose, regardless of whether we reach our target goal amount.Now in this next stage of the Elysium Arctic project we are making a call for support to help us share our vision far and wide. We are putting the finishing touches on the plans for the Elysium Artists for the Arctic exhibitions that will premiere in New York and Singapore on 23 March and 5 April, 2017 respectively. Through photos, paintings, sculptures, videos and music, these exhibitions will connect with people around the globe, changing their perception of this northern polar region so that they better comprehend the importance of the Arctic and why all of us must do everything in our power to protect it. $20 Donation: You will receive a one-year Ocean Geographic E-edition subscription and an invitation to preview the online Exhibition gallery on 20 March.  YES – you will be the first to see the exhibition! You will also be credited as a supporter in the HONOUR ROLL of Elysium Arctic (ElysiumEpic.org).$50 Donation: You will receive all of the above plus a limited edition pin designed exclusively for the Elysium Arctic expedition. In addition, you will receive a signed souvenir print edition of Ocean Geographic magazine featuring a gallery of work from the premiere exhibition and an in-depth interview with Dr. Sylvia Earle.$200 Donation: You will receive all of the $50 perks as well as an author-autographed copy of the hand-sewn case-bound limited edition of the Elysium Artists for the Arctic book (valued at $150).Patron of Exhibition $11,000: You will receive the entire $200 package, ten copies of the author-autographed, hand-sewn, case-bound limited edition Elysium Artists for the Arctic book, plus you will be credited as our patron at the entrance of the exhibition and in all promotional materials.

<p>Please join <strong>Ecology Crossroads</strong> for our <strong>20th anniversary and founders reunion</strong> to begin a capital development campaign to re-establish our non-profit organization with a revised international mission and a special focus project with <strong>a new ecovillage charter</strong> we are initiating that serves as a ecological community development demonstration model (way down here) in the Northern Amazon this Earth Day, which we and the Global Ecovillage Network (GEN-International) are also calling <strong>Ecovillage Day!</strong></p>
<p>The Indiegogo (Ecovillage Day) goal is to <strong>open our Amazonian ecovillage by Earth Day, April 22</strong> to 
friends, ecotourists, students and volunteers who like camping and to accommodate other arriving member residents to begin our first production cooperative development of sustainable products for delivery by August to our funders and supporters here. Friends, new members and social network supporters can help too by donating as little as 3, 9 or 27€ to plant trees in our food forest development and reforestation efforts in and near the Ekobius village. </p>
<p>Donors also get to download great eBooks from our membership reference library to enhance their education about the environment, our ecology and sustainability. </p>
<p>Our ecovillage is connected through a number of Internet based network partnerships through our premier social media partner
<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globcal_International"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Globcal International information provided by Wikipedia"">Globcal International</a> and we can also be found also on Indiegogo, Idealist, Taking IT Global, Pando, Ecobasa.org, GreenMap, HelpX, Causes, FIC (Fellowship for Intentional Communities) and with WWOOF (World-Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms).</p>
<p><strong>We are also offering our supporters our first line of cooperative products</strong> produced and harvested in our ecovillage this season. The products we are producing include indigenous art from our neighbor cooperators, herbs and medicinal plants collected locally, medicinal preparations made by shaman, superfoods, coffee, and even chocolates. Do you like chocolate? (Check the products out below)<br/></p><p>We will add new products like herbal sacraments, aromatics, plant seeds, tree bark and some hand crafted wood products that are unique and limited during the Indiegogo campaign. To learn more check back for updates frequently and follow the social media.</p>

Our project is just beginning and the world is changing, <strong>change with us! Join us in our real-life adventures and creative reality here at the ecovillage.</strong></p>
<h4>Our Indiegogo mission and goals.</h4>
<p>Initially we considered developing many small projects on Indiegogo because of the complexity and scale of our project. Individual 
members wanted to create individual projects, however we tempered their enthusiasm to do the project collectively, accountably, and with public transparency. We consider our efforts a great social responsibility. Help us to create a such a village that is completely self-sufficient or what we call <strong>eco-indie'pendent.</strong></p>
<img alt=""Registry e3 Project"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://namazon.org/images/e3regicon.png"" src="""" style=""border-width: 0px; margin: 10px; float: right;"" title=""Globcal e3 Integrity Based Crowdfunding Program and Application""/><p class=""smaller"">Our project is involved in the development of special crowdfunding integrity development method called<strong> e³</strong>, its a method and formula under development by Globcal which requires our project to be executed over a 9-12 month period in three orderly phases, each phase shall realize 9 objectives. The system is highly accountable and based on the ideal model of a computer registry or Rubik's cube which is based on a 3x3x3 and has 27 elements. </p>
<p>Based on our success with the initial phase (Phase I) and our cooperative membership development drive, Globcal International will 
become involved during the second phase (Phase II) with the installation a community school and opportunity center to integrate and capacitate our village to become sustainable socioeconomically through their team of Goodwill Ambassadors. </p>
<p class=""smaller""><strong>Phase I</strong> - will make the ecovillage functional to accommodate volunteers and guests involved in the initial construction and foundation of the cooperative. Kitchen, campsites, restrooms, septic, internet, restore orange and pineapple grove, and establish initial cooperative production equipment to make our indie stuff and become self-sufficient. Our first phase will result in a completely functional (almost modern) outpost and camping facility with 12 full-time residents (or more) and accommodations for up to 24 campers.</p>
<p class=""smaller""><strong>Phase II</strong> will be focused on the continued development of our tourism plan and campground. Through the help of Globcal it will also begin the establishment of an open-community school and interactive community center for the presentation of workshops and to accommodate community interaction focusing on sustainable living and socioeconomic solvency of the extended regional community through its members.</p>
<p class=""smaller""><strong>Phase III</strong> will be the finishing phase to carry out our dream ideals where we will realize our goals and objectives in one form or another. Its here we plan to garner adequate support based on the developed contacts to take our project to its speculative development. We expect this final phase to change significantly or at least be modified based on the people dynamics of the forming community.</p>

<p>I am arriving in the Amazon on March 03 with likeminded friends to meet up with the <strong>ecovillage pioneers</strong> to tackle and begin the development of great works in agroecology, permaculture and protection of the natural environment. Our goal is to sustain public-benefit ecosystem services for our own impressive local ecology, and <strong>for everyone else in the world</strong> who wants to breathe clean air and drink fresh water that we generate here in our forests. </p>
<p>This is not the first time I have had the opportunity to promote Earth Day, Arbor Day, work with delicate habitats and ecosystems, or organize environmental events; <strong>it is the first time </strong> though that<strong> I have been involved in building an ecovillage</strong> and it's my <strong>first time on Indiegogo.</strong></p>
<p>I am very fortunate that the timing of our event came together so well this year with Earth Day, the subject of the environment, 
ecovillages, and coincidentally with my personal itineraries to give me the ability to personally facilitate the remarkable development we are embarking upon now. 
I am giving it my all, combining all my skills and sharing 40 years of experience with Earth Day and Arbor Day. </p>

<h3>We are on Indiegogo to be Indie!</h3>
<img alt=""The Ekobius Iguana"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://namazon.org/images/iguana.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; border-width: 0px; margin: 10px;"" title=""One of the Ekobius mascots, this one's name is Mr. Iguana""/><p><strong>Here is the Indiegogo part!</strong> We are promoting and developing 3 projects in one (cooperative, community, commerce) and must present and develop the big project in three phases that attain 9 objectives each, relative to the development of a sustainable ecovillage. Also each phase must guarantee the commencement of the next phase. Sounds easy enough, right?</p>
<p>We are attempting to make the project accessible as an independent event and present opportunity publicly through Indiegogo for others to use as an example to help other communities in formation and to attract a diverse group of supporters and participants for our own project.</p>
<p>To be an Indie for us, means to be ""independent and unique,"" think out of the box,"" or at least differently than the mainstream people. This was not easy for us because there are so many mainstreamers that have told us <strong>no</strong>, but despite the odds,<strong> we did it! </strong>We beat the odds, thought out of the box, and are becoming<strong> Indies!!!</strong></p>
<p>It was not easy becoming an Indie, in many ways for others it is just a mindset but for me it has become a way of life. <strong>Different is GOOD!</strong> I have been doing things differently since I started marched on Earth Day in 1970 and it has all led me here.</p>
<h4>Our cooperative and Indie product line.</h4>
<p>To promote our project on Indiegogo we wanted to become real <strong>""indies""</strong> first, so we had to create something uniquely independent that could not be easily duplicated, that which makes us independent; for us independence also means self-reliance, being unique, different and even self-determinant.</p>
<p>Our cooperative will produce and offer special unique fair-trade products from the Amazon made by indigenous people (cooperative members) within our community. Herbs, spices, medicines, teas, chocolate, candy, fruit preserves and superfoods collected exclusively in the unexplored Guiana Highlands, Upper Orinoco and Amazon river basins. All funds go directly to the general community and the cooperative members.</p>
<h5>First production of our community cottage-industry products.</h5>
<p>Our Indiegogo crowdfunding project will help us (the ecovillage residents) cultivate, produce, distribute and market herbs, medicinal plants and preparations that promote <strong>well-being</strong> made by shaman and native healers from the Amazon. Their tradition combined with the modern knowledge of the natural sciences, permaculture and organic horticulture through the members of the Ekōbius International Cooperative is creating a special niche for <strong>exclusive limited high quality natural health and wellness products</strong>. </p>

<p>Through the introduction of new ideas, simple technology and country knowledge we are capacitating our entire village and enriching the lives of the neighbors living in our community. The products being developed based on the sustainable collection, harvest and local barter of fruits, seeds, plants, spices and herbs from all over the Amazon is going to be successful in helping to alleviate poverty.</p>
<h2>We are building an ecovillage too!</h2>
<p>Our project has been in the planning stage for the past five years. Now, finally in 2014, we are moving forward to put together our whole earth team together again of innovators, activists, and now indies; we began adding new members too, and its getting impressive.</p>
<img alt=""Fundo Ekobius Cabin Lodge, Indigenous Nieghbors, Friends Planting Tree Seedlings"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://namazon.org/images/peoplehoriz.png"" src="""" style=""border-width: 0px; margin: 10px;"" title=""Fundo Ekobius Cabin Lodge, Indigenous Nieghbors, Friends Planting Tree Seedlings""/><p>We are combining <strong>eCooperators</strong> and <strong>Eco-Pioneers</strong> some of us are old heads like me, David Wright and lifetime friends like Michael Gallagher and Javier Vazquez, while others participating here are new teammates helping out (joined Ecology Crossroads or Ekobius) to fulfill the dream of a sustainable ecological planet. Our business model involves cooperation, local agribusiness, non-wood forest products, agroecology, conservation stewardship, and ecological tourism.</p>
<p>Now Zen Benefiel, Michael Sher, and Karen Cantrell, goodwill ambassadors who work with David through Globcal International and 
his fellow Kentucky Colonels have become involved in the Ecology Crossroads anniversary and the Earth Day (Ecovillage Day) event on Facebook. Davis said he was also pleased his first son Col. Nicholas Wright, an eco-nanoscience PhD candidate at Vanderbilt, his daughter Maya-Lis, also an eco-science student, and new friend Tony Ly, a fellow resident from Ekobius all taking up roles as officers and trustees at Ecology Crossroads. All of the paperwork is being prepared now to officially re-state our articles and bylaws on the week of April 22, 2014, in Frankfort, Kentucky.</p>
<p>If you are the rugged type and have skills to offer, or just want a vacation come join our eco-crew of green cooperators and pioneers we may change your perspective on life. Many new participants are arriving here simply seeking a natural life free of mainstream belief systems so they can return to nature; others are young folks on a journey down the path to enlightenment.</p>
<p>You can come in person or join us online, we are just getting started, we already have 9 residents including the dog; there are others arriving soon from Ireland, Sweden, Holland, Denmark, Colorado, and Kentucky. Now on March 03, David will be arriving with Tony Ly one of the project co-founders and they will get started with preliminary construction and foundational work.</p>
<p>Enjoy! Gaia, sacred shamanic journeys, extreme biodiversity, 3 day nature walks, abundant fresh water, long canoe trips, superfruits, and deep ecology as an ecoplaneteer with our indigenous neighbors and the deep nature of the moist forests of the Guiana highlands.</p>
<h3>Come to Fundo Ekobius</h3>
<p>Come join us at our developing ecovillage. We have plans to make our ecological village one of the best known models for self sufficiency and permaculture design in the world. Our focus is on nature itself with design and development energy being focused on the establishment of a botanical garden, an experimental ecological station, and a natural history center. Permaculture and self sufficiency are also top-priority for the community and through the botanical aspect there will also be a significant focus on the establishment of food forests (agroecological enriched forest plots).</p>
<p>Support the project by becoming a supporting member, becoming a consumer of our coop products, purchasing a cooperative timeshare which allows you to visit annually for 2-4 weeks, come as a volunteer, our apply to come on an independent internship, or you can move in as a full-time cooperative member and resident if you think you can get along with the rest of the crew and residents.</p>
<img alt=""Fundo Ekobius - Catañiapo river, Amazon Grapes (superfruit), and the Ekobius pineapple patch."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://namazon.org/images/fundohoriz.png"" src="""" style=""border-width: 0px; margin: 10px; float: right;"" title=""Fundo Ekobius - Catañiapo river, Amazon Grapes (superfruit), and the Ekobius pineapple patch.""/><h4>Phase I (March 03 - April 30, 2014) </h4>
<p>Our 'Phase I' development will focus on improving accommodations for members, guests and volunteers that are arriving. Right now during the dry season accommodations are limited to primitive camping, a community kitchen with no stove or sink, and a main lodge that will be used for tools, office and as a social hall for meetings during the initial construction phase. Later (in May or June) once a new caney is built, the main lodge will be converted into to a bed and breakfast that accommodates 8 people.</p>
<p>We developed our project in such a way that it reaches completion at every level, the projects focused will each be completed objectively and methodically so projects are not left undone during development and all the residents are well accommodated.</p>
<p>We are raising 27,000 Euro to purchase and install a commercial stove and oven, a kitchen sink, install a VSAT for Internet access, make kitchen cabinets, build restrooms, a bath house, rebuild the big caney 40ft x 80ft, upgrade and recondition the lodge, top prune 40 giant mango trees, build a maintenance shop and storage building, purchase tools and other necessary equipment. </p>
<p>There will be special emphasis on the kitchen area because it will be used to process raw materials into homemade culinary and medicinal products. It is here that we will make our <strong>special chocolate, roast Amazonian wild coffee, macerate prepared elixir 
concoctions, and make preserves from the rare superfruits</strong> that we have around us.</p>
<p>Most of the work performed already is relative to grounds maintenance, surveying, clearing brush, planting trees, installing irrigation lines, and we began to design an ecological landscape. The priority now is to be sure that all our arriving guests are well accommodated, our project is rich in practical application, there is constant activity and learning opportunities, and that it is designed in a way that is totally sustainable.</p>
<p>We may even install a small pond for convenient water access and to satisfy our agricultural needs, its also gives birds a place to 
drink and toads a place to reproduce resulting in lots of little bug catchers running around in the garden.</p>
<p>It is a village, while 27,000 Euro is not very much during the initial phase, it is enough to make the site more habitable and hospitable for travelers and visitors, so we can have the soup on when folks arrive. The overall project with all of the fantasy and magic our members would like to implement to make the site completely self-sustaining and productive for ourselves and the greater community is currently projected at 303,489.00 € and it includes a low-voltage solar electric system, grounds lighting, extensive underground cabling and waterlines, 27 campsites, 27 cabins, a 5 acre lake, aquaponics, green houses, protected plantings, and a number of projects like plant and food dehydration building and a processing center for the small scale industrialization of our 
products by residents. </p>
<p>The ecovillage center when complete will include 50 cooperative jobs and provide for over 60 families living in and around Ekobius. We have lots of work to do!</p>
<p>We will be here at least once every two weeks with a good and thorough update of progress, plans, accomplishments, nuances, and modifications to or campaign followers well informed as stated below.</p>
<h4>Phase II and Phase III</h4>
<p>Phases 2 and 3 of our project are entirely independent crowdfunding campaigns, that must be carried out within the course of 9 months to one year after the first phase to remain qualified and enrolled in the <strong>Globcal International e³ Crowdfunding Method</strong>. Their current plans are to incorporate the development of a school for our local community to facilitate a 
new joint project ideal for ecovillage residents and for tourists to have a cultural exchange center at or nearby the ecovillage.</p>
<p>The sequential project phases and their place in the overall project are discussed in round about terms, as proposed plans and ideal initiatives that are being discussed or are under development, those speculative and dreamy ecovillage details can be found in our website and on our blog.</p>
<p>Additional informational will also be posted and updated to here very soon, and you may also notice updates to some of the places we are listed while we were nesting our ideals. Meanwhile you can follow the objective and current reality here on INDIEGOGO and through the social media for the most up to date information, or contact us directly!</p>

Amazon, Medicinal Plants, Superfoods, Technology, Sustainability
Let's meet at the crossroads on Earth Day, to build our futures now.

Please join Ecology Crossroads for our 20th anniversary and founders reunion to begin a capital development campaign to re-establish our non-profit organization with a revised international mission and a special focus project with a new ecovillage charter we are initiating that serves as a ecological community development demonstration model (way down here) in the Northern Amazon this Earth Day, which we and the Global Ecovillage Network (GEN-International) are also calling Ecovillage Day!
The Indiegogo (Ecovillage Day) goal is to open our Amazonian ecovillage by Earth Day, April 22 to 
friends, ecotourists, students and volunteers who like camping and to accommodate other arriving member residents to begin our first production cooperative development of sustainable products for delivery by August to our funders and supporters here. Friends, new members and social network supporters can help too by donating as little as 3, 9 or 27€ to plant trees in our food forest development and reforestation efforts in and near the Ekobius village. 
Donors also get to download great eBooks from our membership reference library to enhance their education about the environment, our ecology and sustainability. 
Our ecovillage is connected through a number of Internet based network partnerships through our premier social media partner
Globcal International and we can also be found also on Indiegogo, Idealist, Taking IT Global, Pando, Ecobasa.org, GreenMap, HelpX, Causes, FIC (Fellowship for Intentional Communities) and with WWOOF (World-Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms).
We are also offering our supporters our first line of cooperative products produced and harvested in our ecovillage this season. The products we are producing include indigenous art from our neighbor cooperators, herbs and medicinal plants collected locally, medicinal preparations made by shaman, superfoods, coffee, and even chocolates. Do you like chocolate? (Check the products out below)We will add new products like herbal sacraments, aromatics, plant seeds, tree bark and some hand crafted wood products that are unique and limited during the Indiegogo campaign. To learn more check back for updates frequently and follow the social media.
You can also participate first hand by visiting us in the Amazon as a collaborating visitor, sponsor, maybe as a volunteer; you can also help us online through Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn, YouTube, Twitter and on Pinterest. Our project is just beginning and the world is changing, change with us! Join us in our real-life adventures and creative reality here at the ecovillage.
Our Indiegogo mission and goals.
Initially we considered developing many small projects on Indiegogo because of the complexity and scale of our project. Individual 
members wanted to create individual projects, however we tempered their enthusiasm to do the project collectively, accountably, and with public transparency. We consider our efforts a great social responsibility. Help us to create a such a village that is completely self-sufficient or what we call eco-indie'pendent.
Our project is involved in the development of special crowdfunding integrity development method called e³, its a method and formula under development by Globcal which requires our project to be executed over a 9-12 month period in three orderly phases, each phase shall realize 9 objectives. The system is highly accountable and based on the ideal model of a computer registry or Rubik's cube which is based on a 3x3x3 and has 27 elements. 
Based on our success with the initial phase (Phase I) and our cooperative membership development drive, Globcal International will 
become involved during the second phase (Phase II) with the installation a community school and opportunity center to integrate and capacitate our village to become sustainable socioeconomically through their team of Goodwill Ambassadors. 
Phase I - will make the ecovillage functional to accommodate volunteers and guests involved in the initial construction and foundation of the cooperative. Kitchen, campsites, restrooms, septic, internet, restore orange and pineapple grove, and establish initial cooperative production equipment to make our indie stuff and become self-sufficient. Our first phase will result in a completely functional (almost modern) outpost and camping facility with 12 full-time residents (or more) and accommodations for up to 24 campers.
Phase II will be focused on the continued development of our tourism plan and campground. Through the help of Globcal it will also begin the establishment of an open-community school and interactive community center for the presentation of workshops and to accommodate community interaction focusing on sustainable living and socioeconomic solvency of the extended regional community through its members.
Phase III will be the finishing phase to carry out our dream ideals where we will realize our goals and objectives in one form or another. Its here we plan to garner adequate support based on the developed contacts to take our project to its speculative development. We expect this final phase to change significantly or at least be modified based on the people dynamics of the forming community.
David, Earth Day, Ecovillage Day, and the Eco-Pioneers
I am David Wright, American expat living in Venezuela's Amazon, I am here teaching agroecology and Fair-Wild certification to the indigenous people who are my neighbors, playing a little soccer too; while they are teaching me about indigenous ""tec'knowledge,"" I am also involved in building an ecovillage with an international cooperative I helped create, and I am here demonstrating to others online through the social media how to live sustainably and what it means to be an Indien!

I am arriving in the Amazon on March 03 with likeminded friends to meet up with the ecovillage pioneers to tackle and begin the development of great works in agroecology, permaculture and protection of the natural environment. Our goal is to sustain public-benefit ecosystem services for our own impressive local ecology, and for everyone else in the world who wants to breathe clean air and drink fresh water that we generate here in our forests. 
This is not the first time I have had the opportunity to promote Earth Day, Arbor Day, work with delicate habitats and ecosystems, or organize environmental events; it is the first time  though that I have been involved in building an ecovillage and it's my first time on Indiegogo.
I am very fortunate that the timing of our event came together so well this year with Earth Day, the subject of the environment, 
ecovillages, and coincidentally with my personal itineraries to give me the ability to personally facilitate the remarkable development we are embarking upon now. 
I am giving it my all, combining all my skills and sharing 40 years of experience with Earth Day and Arbor Day. 
""Get involved with David, you're gonna love his Earth Day (Ecovillage Day) 
project on Facebook and the initial steps he is taking to begin. His organizational plan is engaged with Globcal International too and it follows the new e³ integrity method!"" -Zen Benefiel, Ecology Crossroads
Worldwide this year there is a renewed interest and new focus on sustainable ecological community development, the concept of the ecovillage is now a top-priority development for organizations and governments working toward the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDG)s, we have all learned over the past few years that the ecovillage is the most practical solution for ecologically sustainable human settlements.
Earth Day (Ecovillage Day 2014)
According to the Global Ecovillage Network where our project is connected, and according to the Earth Day Network, the date for Ecovillage Day is now annually held on Earth Day on April 22nd, so please mark your calendar! 
Show your solidarity to our cause and ideals through Earth Day here online! At our ecovillage in the Amazon we will be working for six days during our event planting trees and holding workshops; our event will run the entire week from Activist Day on Sunday, April 20th until Arbor Day on Friday, April 25th. We will pause during the week-long activity for one hour of meditation worldwide on Earth Day at 9:00 am according to the clock in Rio de Janeiro, 12 am in Dakar, 2 pm Berlin, 4 pm in Moscow, and 9 pm in Tokyo. On the 26th we are having a picnic for all the program participants and nieghbors!
Please join us for it being coordinated and promoted on Facebook and through other social media. Earth Day (Ecovillage Day) Event.
We are on Indiegogo to be Indie!
Here is the Indiegogo part! We are promoting and developing 3 projects in one (cooperative, community, commerce) and must present and develop the big project in three phases that attain 9 objectives each, relative to the development of a sustainable ecovillage. Also each phase must guarantee the commencement of the next phase. Sounds easy enough, right?
We are attempting to make the project accessible as an independent event and present opportunity publicly through Indiegogo for others to use as an example to help other communities in formation and to attract a diverse group of supporters and participants for our own project.
To be an Indie for us, means to be ""independent and unique,"" think out of the box,"" or at least differently than the mainstream people. This was not easy for us because there are so many mainstreamers that have told us no, but despite the odds, we did it! We beat the odds, thought out of the box, and are becoming Indies!!!
It was not easy becoming an Indie, in many ways for others it is just a mindset but for me it has become a way of life. Different is GOOD! I have been doing things differently since I started marched on Earth Day in 1970 and it has all led me here.
Our cooperative and Indie product line.
To promote our project on Indiegogo we wanted to become real ""indies"" first, so we had to create something uniquely independent that could not be easily duplicated, that which makes us independent; for us independence also means self-reliance, being unique, different and even self-determinant.
Our cooperative will produce and offer special unique fair-trade products from the Amazon made by indigenous people (cooperative members) within our community. Herbs, spices, medicines, teas, chocolate, candy, fruit preserves and superfoods collected exclusively in the unexplored Guiana Highlands, Upper Orinoco and Amazon river basins. All funds go directly to the general community and the cooperative members.

Our Indiegogo crowdfunding project will help us (the ecovillage residents) cultivate, produce, distribute and market herbs, medicinal plants and preparations that promote well-being made by shaman and native healers from the Amazon. Their tradition combined with the modern knowledge of the natural sciences, permaculture and organic horticulture through the members of the Ekōbius International Cooperative is creating a special niche for exclusive limited high quality natural health and wellness products. 
You can participate in our project through crowdfunding to support our cause and effort to build a model ecological village and cooperative socioeconomic community by purchasing our first premium homemade (artesanal) products that we are producing this Spring through the Summer at ""Fundo Ekōbius"" with our cooperative members.
Sustainable superfruit (food) crops like cupuazu, acai, merecure, moringa and other fantastic medicinal foods and other plants that are used locally as cures for a range of diseases and ailments, which due to lack of information about curing techniques and preservation methods few have been offered more than locally, until now through our project. 
Through the introduction of new ideas, simple technology and country knowledge we are capacitating our entire village and enriching the lives of the neighbors living in our community. The products being developed based on the sustainable collection, harvest and local barter of fruits, seeds, plants, spices and herbs from all over the Amazon is going to be successful in helping to alleviate poverty.
We are building an ecovillage too!
Our project has been in the planning stage for the past five years. Now, finally in 2014, we are moving forward to put together our whole earth team together again of innovators, activists, and now indies; we began adding new members too, and its getting impressive.
We are combining eCooperators and Eco-Pioneers some of us are old heads like me, David Wright and lifetime friends like Michael Gallagher and Javier Vazquez, while others participating here are new teammates helping out (joined Ecology Crossroads or Ekobius) to fulfill the dream of a sustainable ecological planet. Our business model involves cooperation, local agribusiness, non-wood forest products, agroecology, conservation stewardship, and ecological tourism.
Now Zen Benefiel, Michael Sher, and Karen Cantrell, goodwill ambassadors who work with David through Globcal International and 
his fellow Kentucky Colonels have become involved in the Ecology Crossroads anniversary and the Earth Day (Ecovillage Day) event on Facebook. Davis said he was also pleased his first son Col. Nicholas Wright, an eco-nanoscience PhD candidate at Vanderbilt, his daughter Maya-Lis, also an eco-science student, and new friend Tony Ly, a fellow resident from Ekobius all taking up roles as officers and trustees at Ecology Crossroads. All of the paperwork is being prepared now to officially re-state our articles and bylaws on the week of April 22, 2014, in Frankfort, Kentucky.
If you are the rugged type and have skills to offer, or just want a vacation come join our eco-crew of green cooperators and pioneers we may change your perspective on life. Many new participants are arriving here simply seeking a natural life free of mainstream belief systems so they can return to nature; others are young folks on a journey down the path to enlightenment.
You can come in person or join us online, we are just getting started, we already have 9 residents including the dog; there are others arriving soon from Ireland, Sweden, Holland, Denmark, Colorado, and Kentucky. Now on March 03, David will be arriving with Tony Ly one of the project co-founders and they will get started with preliminary construction and foundational work.
Enjoy! Gaia, sacred shamanic journeys, extreme biodiversity, 3 day nature walks, abundant fresh water, long canoe trips, superfruits, and deep ecology as an ecoplaneteer with our indigenous neighbors and the deep nature of the moist forests of the Guiana highlands.
Come to Fundo Ekobius
Come join us at our developing ecovillage. We have plans to make our ecological village one of the best known models for self sufficiency and permaculture design in the world. Our focus is on nature itself with design and development energy being focused on the establishment of a botanical garden, an experimental ecological station, and a natural history center. Permaculture and self sufficiency are also top-priority for the community and through the botanical aspect there will also be a significant focus on the establishment of food forests (agroecological enriched forest plots).
Support the project by becoming a supporting member, becoming a consumer of our coop products, purchasing a cooperative timeshare which allows you to visit annually for 2-4 weeks, come as a volunteer, our apply to come on an independent internship, or you can move in as a full-time cooperative member and resident if you think you can get along with the rest of the crew and residents.
Phase I (March 03 - April 30, 2014) 
Our 'Phase I' development will focus on improving accommodations for members, guests and volunteers that are arriving. Right now during the dry season accommodations are limited to primitive camping, a community kitchen with no stove or sink, and a main lodge that will be used for tools, office and as a social hall for meetings during the initial construction phase. Later (in May or June) once a new caney is built, the main lodge will be converted into to a bed and breakfast that accommodates 8 people.
We developed our project in such a way that it reaches completion at every level, the projects focused will each be completed objectively and methodically so projects are not left undone during development and all the residents are well accommodated.
We are raising 27,000 Euro to purchase and install a commercial stove and oven, a kitchen sink, install a VSAT for Internet access, make kitchen cabinets, build restrooms, a bath house, rebuild the big caney 40ft x 80ft, upgrade and recondition the lodge, top prune 40 giant mango trees, build a maintenance shop and storage building, purchase tools and other necessary equipment. 
There will be special emphasis on the kitchen area because it will be used to process raw materials into homemade culinary and medicinal products. It is here that we will make our special chocolate, roast Amazonian wild coffee, macerate prepared elixir 
concoctions, and make preserves from the rare superfruits that we have around us.
Most of the work performed already is relative to grounds maintenance, surveying, clearing brush, planting trees, installing irrigation lines, and we began to design an ecological landscape. The priority now is to be sure that all our arriving guests are well accommodated, our project is rich in practical application, there is constant activity and learning opportunities, and that it is designed in a way that is totally sustainable.
We may even install a small pond for convenient water access and to satisfy our agricultural needs, its also gives birds a place to 
drink and toads a place to reproduce resulting in lots of little bug catchers running around in the garden.
It is a village, while 27,000 Euro is not very much during the initial phase, it is enough to make the site more habitable and hospitable for travelers and visitors, so we can have the soup on when folks arrive. The overall project with all of the fantasy and magic our members would like to implement to make the site completely self-sustaining and productive for ourselves and the greater community is currently projected at 303,489.00 € and it includes a low-voltage solar electric system, grounds lighting, extensive underground cabling and waterlines, 27 campsites, 27 cabins, a 5 acre lake, aquaponics, green houses, protected plantings, and a number of projects like plant and food dehydration building and a processing center for the small scale industrialization of our 
products by residents. 
The ecovillage center when complete will include 50 cooperative jobs and provide for over 60 families living in and around Ekobius. We have lots of work to do!
We will be here at least once every two weeks with a good and thorough update of progress, plans, accomplishments, nuances, and modifications to or campaign followers well informed as stated below.
Phase II and Phase III
Phases 2 and 3 of our project are entirely independent crowdfunding campaigns, that must be carried out within the course of 9 months to one year after the first phase to remain qualified and enrolled in the Globcal International e³ Crowdfunding Method. Their current plans are to incorporate the development of a school for our local community to facilitate a 
new joint project ideal for ecovillage residents and for tourists to have a cultural exchange center at or nearby the ecovillage.
The sequential project phases and their place in the overall project are discussed in round about terms, as proposed plans and ideal initiatives that are being discussed or are under development, those speculative and dreamy ecovillage details can be found in our website and on our blog.
Additional informational will also be posted and updated to here very soon, and you may also notice updates to some of the places we are listed while we were nesting our ideals.

This is very stressful for the birds and reduces their chances of

the hunting season in a safe area, including on the island of Comino
which is a bird sanctuary where hunting is not permitted.</p>

found to increase the number that can be rehabilitated.</p>
<p></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">BirdLife
Malta

<p><b>Hudson Rising: Stories of Revival from the Hudson Valley</b></p>
<p>We're trying to complete our movie about the Hudson Valley - and we need your help to do it! <br/></p>
<p>After three years, production of <i>Hudson Rising</i> is nearly complete and the premiere is scheduled for October 26<sup>th</sup> 2013! <i>Hudson Rising</i> is a collection of stories celebrating citizens who are making a difference in the Valley: kids rebuilding downtowns, farmers reinventing farming, the scientist who dreamed that the Hudson Valley could become the next Silicon Valley, and many more.<br/></p>
<p>When the movie's complete, it will be screened on <a href=""http://www.wmht.org/home/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">WMHT</a> and other PBS stations and at over 50 venues up and down the Hudson Valley. We believe seeing these stories in the movie will change the way citizens see the future of the Hudson Valley – inspiring them to join the very real revival that is already underway and make it stick.</p>
<p><b>But we need your help. </b>Despite all the enormous support we have from our partner groups in the Valley, this is a low-budget project that has gotten this far through some modest grants and the generosity of a few donors. We still need to raise $20,000 to pay for the final post-production costs, including licensing archival footage and sound editing and mixing. Please help us get to the finish line and make a difference in the Hudson Valley!</p>
<p><i>All contributions towards the movie  are tax-deductible donations to the Hudson River Foundation.</i></p>

<p><b>Background</b></p>
<p>In 2009, New York celebrated the
four hundredth anniversary of Henry Hudson’s voyage up the Hudson River. There
were parades, fireworks, historic boats and much more. But mostly people didn’t
want to focus on the Hudson Valley’s past. They wanted to talk about its
future.</p>
<p>The citizens of the Hudson Valley
feel a renaissance is under way in the valley – but it is incomplete. Hudson
and Beacon are reviving, but other urban areas have been left behind, and too many kids are stuck in neighborhoods without access to Valley's nature or prospects for a good job. A new
food movement is sweeping the region – but we’re losing farms every day.
Appreciation for the Valley’s landscape and River is growing – but the Valley is
threatened by suburban sprawl and the river’s shad and sturgeon have been in decline.
How can we address these challenges and make the Valley’s renaissance complete?</p>
<p>A group of activists led by Chair of the Hudson Quadricentenial Commission Joan Davidson came together to establish a new coalition, OurHudson, to keep the conversation going. OurHudson convened task forces of
experts to come up with recommendations. Then we restored a historic barge and
towed it from city to city, where citizens came aboard and discussed reviving
farms and bringing back the Valley’s urban areas. It was clear that the
conversation needed to be expanded further. </p>
<p>So we decided to commission a
film. <i>Hudson Rising</i> is nearly complete, the premiere is scheduled, over 50 venues and WMHT have agreed to screen the movie - <b>but we need your help!</b></p>

We're trying to complete our movie about the Hudson Valley - and we need your help to do it! 
After three years, production of Hudson Rising is nearly complete and the premiere is scheduled for October 26th 2013! Hudson Rising is a collection of stories celebrating citizens who are making a difference in the Valley: kids rebuilding downtowns, farmers reinventing farming, the scientist who dreamed that the Hudson Valley could become the next Silicon Valley, and many more.
When the movie's complete, it will be screened on WMHT and other PBS stations and at over 50 venues up and down the Hudson Valley. We believe seeing these stories in the movie will change the way citizens see the future of the Hudson Valley – inspiring them to join the very real revival that is already underway and make it stick.
But we need your help. Despite all the enormous support we have from our partner groups in the Valley, this is a low-budget project that has gotten this far through some modest grants and the generosity of a few donors. We still need to raise $20,000 to pay for the final post-production costs, including licensing archival footage and sound editing and mixing. Please help us get to the finish line and make a difference in the Hudson Valley!
All contributions towards the movie  are tax-deductible donations to the Hudson River Foundation.



Background
In 2009, New York celebrated the
four hundredth anniversary of Henry Hudson’s voyage up the Hudson River. There
were parades, fireworks, historic boats and much more. But mostly people didn’t
want to focus on the Hudson Valley’s past. They wanted to talk about its
future.
The citizens of the Hudson Valley
feel a renaissance is under way in the valley – but it is incomplete. Hudson
and Beacon are reviving, but other urban areas have been left behind, and too many kids are stuck in neighborhoods without access to Valley's nature or prospects for a good job. A new
food movement is sweeping the region – but we’re losing farms every day.
Appreciation for the Valley’s landscape and River is growing – but the Valley is
threatened by suburban sprawl and the river’s shad and sturgeon have been in decline.
How can we address these challenges and make the Valley’s renaissance complete?
A group of activists led by Chair of the Hudson Quadricentenial Commission Joan Davidson came together to establish a new coalition, OurHudson, to keep the conversation going. OurHudson convened task forces of

This is all being offered by donation from all of us . We hope that if you can't be present that you'll do the next best thing and offer a donation to make this possible. It is hoped that with Your Help this can become a yearly event, inspired by all that Mario loved so very much and bringing awareness to creating unity across all lands and cultures and especially the healing and protection of the bodies of water of our great Planet Earth.   Why This is Important: There is a urgent need to bring prayerful action to supporting ALL of earths population to have access to clean water. Regardless if you view Water is a gift from the Creator or not, no one can argue that it is the planets very lifeblood.   Alaska represents one of the last places on Earth where acting quickly and making a stand can preserve an intact, untouched and pristine natural environment. Aquasension aims to make a strong and loving cry of support for Mother Nature/Gaia/Pacha Mama and Her gifts of pure flowing waters, clean air and healthy lands. We stand side-by-side with our native indigenous Alaskan brothers and sisters to celebrate these gifts and act and pray in the ways that are asked of us to raise awareness and prevent further industrialization of the Alaskan wilderness!Today the land of the Chilkat Tlingit people is at risk of high sulfide ore mining. The mining industry aims to dig a mile long tunnel for underground exploration of sulfide ore without Tlingit approval or consent. They intend to mine just six miles up stream of the ancient village of Klukwan. The indigenous people as well as environmentally-minded locals have been defending this land for nearly ten years.... now it’s our turn to join in the cause! The Tlingit people are the Salmon people. Their entire way of life is completely interwoven with the continuation of a healthy river and its fish. The Chilkat River and its salmon friends are sacred to them, as are all the plants and animals. In turn we gather to bring awareness to this matter and honor our heart’s deep knowing that we can make a difference when we stand together as one connected tribe of the Earth. The Tribes Coming: 
The Tlingit, Nez Perce, Lakota and Kogi are coming together to Bless the Water and stand in solidarity for the water in honor of an Angel, Mario Julian Benassi who passed in the Yuba River last year. ""Water is our first medicine, it is our sacred source of life. I am very honored to be invited to this.""- Dan Nanamkin: Nex Perce Tribe Seattle May we lift our hearts and hands together. May we unite in prayerful action towards supporting the return of health to all waters, to the Earth and the humans that live upon her.  We can feel the heart and soul of Mario surrounding us and cheering this on, showering what this will be in Miracles. I encourage you, no matter where you are on the planet to offer a moment to support the Water in this way, big or small, Thank you.

SeaChar was founded in Seattle Washington in 2008. Our mission is to promote the understanding and use of biochar, a highly durable form of charcoal, as a wedge strategy to combat climate change, while it builds the health and productivity of our soils.   Biochar is the high carbon by-product of biomass energy production. Across the world traditional farmers have used charcoal to build more productive soils that store carbon drawn down by plants from the atmosphere. Science shows us that this form of carbon is stable for 1000's of years. Each pound of biochar produced removes three pounds of CO2 from the carbon cycle. That makes the biochar technology cluster a truly carbon negative form of energy production and a potentially significant wedge strategy for mitigating climate change. In 2009 we developed our Estufa Finca (Farm Stove) biochar producing cook-stove as a tool that could put this powerful idea into the hands of farmers and gardeners around the world. The stoves are micro-gasification devices that burn clean and can use a wide range of waste biomass as fuel. <br/>SeaChar now has 5-years of experience introducing this concept in North and Central America. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rowc0Y-1plY&amp;list=UU0Stq0L-FWt5LSh0VAxV6lA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rowc0Y-1plY&amp;amp...</a><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/972394/files/20141030132513-IMG_0168.jpg?1414700713"" src="""" style=""""/></p>We have seen and measured the impact this tool can have on people's lives and on the food they are producing.

With almost 3 billion people still relying on biomass for cooking and heating our little stoves have the potential to have a huge positive impact on the lives of people, forests and the climate. We are putting that experience into developing a second generation biochar producing stove that is more durable and easier to use. We are calling it the ""Estufa Bella"" (the Beautiful Stove) <a href=""https://plus.google.com/photos/114261170173561967216/albums/6001550854549250609?banner=pwa"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://plus.google.com/photos/1142611701735619...</a><br/>

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
The use of open fires to meet the need for cooking, heating and crop processing continues to grow. There is also growing proof of the impact this practice has on human health, our forests and the climate. The World Health Organization estimates 3.8 million premature deaths annually from noncommunicable diseases 
including stroke, ischaemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary
 disease (COPD) and lung cancer can be attributed to exposure to household 
air pollution.<br/>Recent landmark studies have shown that black carbon, like that emitted by traditional cook-stoves ranks “as the second most important individual climate-warming agent after carbon dioxide”.<br/>The laboratory testing of our Estufa Finca cook-stove showed that it produced 92% less particulate matter and 87% less CO than an traditional open fire cook-stove. Field testing indicated that our stoves use 40% less fuel to cook the same meal. That difference is huge in terms of the health and climate impacts of our stove. However we will only see these benefits if people use these stoves. Our experience tells us that people will only use and replace these stoves on an ongoing basis if they are a good value, consistent quality and are convenient to use.<br/>The Estufa Bella will give the cooks a long lasting (3+ year ) stove, made from high tolerance stainless steel kit parts, that has a greater range of temperature control.  That's the kind of product you can build sustainable businesses with and that is what it will take to mainstream this concept.<br/><br/> <br/><ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<br/>We are aware of the fact that we are working on the ""bleeding edge"" of development work with concepts that most people have never heard of.  The risk of failure in this situation is always high. We have experienced failure, you have to accept that risk if you are going to learn and move forward. We have 5-years of that kind of hard-won experience. This is why we feel confident that we can produce and test the device the people we have been working with have been asking for. Our greatest challenge is to give donors and investors confidence in our ability to contribute to real and lasting positive change. A tested and certified biochar producing stove, based on our years of field experience is the foundation we can build that confidence on. That is what it will take to get these stoves into the hands of farmers and gardeners from Seattle, Washington to Bri Bri ,Costa Rica. You are going to help us lay that foundation.<br/><br/><ul><li>

Can Be Rapid, Widespread and Grassroots
Help kids make it happen!
The Basic Idea
I've been teaching kids sustainable living skills and have discovered that they become powerful change-makers, inspiring change in their homes right away.  Kids lead their families to change the way they live despite perceived inabilities or failing wills. Teachers and schools are requesting my curriculum, and I'm writing a book.  It could take years writing it part time, or it could be finished this spring with your help.  Considering the state of the planet, I'm in a bit of a hurry.  

Finished this spring, it would be ready for teachers to use this coming fall, and it could be used for my upcoming: 

 • educator workshops this summer in New Mexico and Oregon
 • environmental educator conference presentations, and
        • a globally available and locally relevant online course being organized for Fall 2011 to Spring 2102.  




Learn More

What if you’d grown up with the chance to learn how to live in a nature connected way?  You would have learned to:



grow your own food and healing herbs, 
collect and recycle your own water, 
build your own structures with local natural materials, and 
generate your own renewable energy.


You could also have learned how to create a living interconnected system of these elements that would do much of the work for you.  Starting young, it would all be second nature to you. 

 What if your family and neighbors had all grown up with the same opportunity?  
 What would your neighborhood and local businesses be like? 
 What if nature connected living was part of education in general?  
 How could that affect your world?

My Story
I’d like to find the answers to these questions.  I’ve been working for ten years to help answer them, teaching nature based sustainable living skills to kids.  They really love it and so do their parents, who tell me how great it is to have their kids respond to their question “So what did you learn in school today?” with enthusiastic details of their experience.  Almost all parents tell me with pride about the family-connecting and earth-caring activities their child learned and insisted on starting at home.  Kids inspire and activate change now!

I’ve begun to work with classroom teachers to help incorporate sustainable living skills into their science, math, language arts and social studies, and it’s been a big hit with the teachers, who also enjoy learning.  Incorporating art, music and drama makes it even more engaging and effective.  

I'm working on a model that involves 
 • student taught workshops for their families and community,
 • local sustainability entrepreneurs and practitioners working with students and school curriculum committees, 
 • basing kids' grades on being creative, cooperative, responsible, and other such things of value to a community striving to be more self reliant.  
These are all part of a concept for an evolving process for toddlers through university level.   

The requests for my curriculum are starting to come in from near and far, even internationally.



Widespread change can happen soon, and YOU can help lay the groundwork!  

What I Need & What You Get 
Covering the $1000 a month I'd earn from substitute teaching (on the days I don't teach sustainable living skills), would make it possible to support my family and write the book this semester.  The fund will also pay for printing costs, and other professional fees.  Reaching the $6,000 goal allows the book to be published in time for the summer workshops.  If the $6,000 goal is not reached, all money received will go towards days off from substitute teaching to help get the book written faster than it would otherwise.  Any money raised above the goal will go towards scholarships for attendees that would be otherwise unable to come to the educator's courses.  
For your kind, generous and immensely appreciated contributions you will receive the knowledge that you are: 
 • contributing to catalyze change in the way we live, which brings joy to children and their families 
 • bringing profound relevance to education, and a sense of purpose to children and youth 
 • supporting the creation of jobs for sustainable living practitioners, helping to define tomorrow's jobs 

 • tying communities together around sustainable living practices.  

Additionally, with deep appreciation for your contributions I will present you with:
$1 - A great sense of contributing to sustainability  
$5 - A recipe for a home made herbal decongestant that my family has used for years
$10 - A recipe for a home made ointment for preventing infection in scrapes or scratches that my family has used for years
$25 - A home made organic bandana 
$50 - An autographed copy of the book for your own use or to donate to the school of your choice
$100 - An autographed photograph of a class of engaged students and acknowledgment in the book if you'd like 
$250 - A vegetable/herb/flower garden design full of companion plantings and acknowledged in book, if you’d like
$500 - Instructions to build a device to recycle laundry greywater (without having to punch a hole through your wall) and acknowledgment in the book, if you’d like
$1000 - Two hours of personal phone or skype consultation on sustainable living for your home and acknowledgment in the book, if you’d like
$5000 - Your choice of a full day of instruction on principles of sustainable design for your home or a hike in the New Mexico mountains with an introduction to edible and medicinal wild plants, or attend a day of one of the educator courses this summer (travel expenses not included) and acknowledgment in the book, if you’d like

<h3>What We Need and What You Get</h3>
<strong>The Project</strong><br/>Our research project calls for purchase of twenty (20) 
Kelulut bee hives, one for each program participant.   The Kelulut hives cost $400 UDS's each and are purchased 
complete with bees (and a viable Queen).  The total cost for hives will be $8000 
USD's.  We plan to engage twenty people here in Terengganu state to be involved 
in our research project.  Each participant will be provided with a Kelulut and 
will receive training in proper Bee Management Practices through attendance at 
several Workshops provided by members of the research team, all Professors at 
UMT.  The goal is to spark interest among the native population regarding the 
potential benefits of small-scale bee farming related to this species of 
stingless bee and to help provide new jobs and revenue access at the 
'grass-roots level'. <br/><br/><p>                                 <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/748548/files/20140728041020-melipona3.jpg?1406545820"" src="""" style=""width: 328.57px; height: 246px;""/></p>
<p>                       <b>Egg Cells of the Trigona itama (Stingless Honeybee)</b><br/></p>No special equipment is required, but participants will be 
provided with books and appropriate garments (hat, safety glasses, gloves and paper-coveralls) 
that will be used when tending the bee colony.  We estimate cost for clothing, 
books and safety equipment to be about $2000 USD's.  So the total cost for this 
project will be Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000 USD's).<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/748514/files/20140728034907-kelulut1.jpg?1406544547"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Kelulut is the term used by native Malays to refer to this kind of beehive, native to the tropical forests and jungles of Malaysia.  There are (presently) 30 known species of the 
stingless bees in Malaysia, called, 'Melipona'.  Our team is studying Trigona 
itama and Trigona minima.  T. itama is the largest of the species, and T. minima 
is the smallest.</p>
<p>The team's research will lead to establishment of better bee management practices and a more comprehensive body of knowledge the stingless honeybee.  The stingless honeybee is  that, prior to our research project,  were not known nor found anywhere in any scientific literature.  So, this work is very important and will help Man discover new findings about this pollinator and about its environment, the Eco-systems in which it thrives and the weather patterns that help this species produce maximum amounts of honey and byproducts (propolis, bee bread, etc.).<br/><br/>You can see some videos that will give you a snapshot

<h3>Risks and Challenges<br/>
</h3>One risk we are confident that will not be encountered is the prospect of participants and researcher being stung by the Melipona.  The Melipona species does not have a lancet, or stinger, and cannot inflict a sting.  However, the Melipona is capable of biting with its tiny jaws or Mandibles.  The width that the mandible is capable of being spread is very, very small.  Thus one can barely feel the bite, if one occurs at all. The Melipona is, generally, very shy and not aggressive and not prone to swarming.   In order to lessen the possibility of any injuries to either bee or project participants a number of workshops related to proper hive management and proper beekeeping techniques will be held.  During the workshops participants will receive one-on-one training with regard to proper bee management and bee hive maintenance practices for the Melipona species.<br/><br/><p>                                               <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/748571/files/20140728045311-JoeHoneySipStinglessBeeMarang.jpg?1406548391"" src="""" style=""width: 253.71px; height: 381px;""/></p>
<p>           <b>Dr. Resnick samples fresh honey from honey pot in Kelulut at Gong Bris</b><br/></p>Collectively, team members possess an aggregate number of over 90 years of experience as Beekeepers and with bee management practices.  Thus, the team believes that it possesses requisite experience and resources to handle any problems that may arise.  If some problem does arise the cannot be resolved by the team, the Project Leader can rely upon the full support of the university to find resolution.</div><div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you're not able to make a donation, you can help us in other ways.  For example, you can help spread the word about our project.  You can discuss the project at work, with friends and you can post our photo's on your Facebook wall, or tweet our messages or tell people about the 'stingless bee'.  Most people don't know there there is a stingless bee and even more, a stingless Honeybee!  People who can't donate can also use the 'share tools' portal on Indiegogo's web page.</p>

<p>Eighteen years ago SolarFest was created from a dream (yes, literally!).  Today that dream would be fairly easy to accomplish, but eighteen years ago this dream was truly revolutionary. This was the birth of solar education on a new unchartered scale in Vermont and across New England. And indeed our founders were more than up to the challenge, they forged the way for what is now a thriving industry not only here in the beautiful hills of Vermont, but throughout the northeast. They proved it could be done, one festival at a time.</p>
<p><strong>The concept has always been clear</strong> – provide education and hands-on experience with renewable energy sources and sustainable practices in an atmosphere of art and music. Bringing industry leaders, innovators, highly experienced users of renewable technologies and newcomers together in a family-friendly environment.  SolarFest demonstrates the possibility of a brighter planet in the bright, shiny package of great music, food, theater and family fun. This allows folks a weekend to relax, recharge and re-invent the way they look at energy, community, and their impact on the world.  Our goal is to encourage attendees and enthusiasts to become a part of the movement and embrace ideas and inspiration by spending a day, or all weekend in a fully renewable energy powered community seeing renewable solutions in use everywhere.</p>
<h2>As we grew...</h2>
<p>Over the years, we have become masters at combining superb family entertainment along with presentations by some of the region's most knowledgeable Renewable Energy and Sustainable Living experts.  We offer a special children's activity area (Kids Corner), and a wide variety of food, craft, renewable energy and sustainable living vendors. Our featured performers represent a far-ranging spectrum of styles and traditions from around the world. We provide plenty of space throughout the weekend for serendipitous encounters, conversation, dancing, hiking, camping, relaxation, and an overall celebration of our planet's beauty.</p>
<p>The premise is that real, concrete learning can only happen when all senses are stimulated and the creative side of people is allowed to come to the surface. <strong>Our event strives to provide the creative stimulation, a really great environment for learning, and countless things to learn, one weekend a yea</strong>r.  SolarFest has become a destination for information and inspiration by presenting our multiple messages basked in the glow of artful and creative experience. We strongly believe that this is the best vehicle for change in the world.</p>
<h2>Ushering in the Next Generation...</h2>
<p>Today one of our biggest challenges is not just trying to keep up with new technologies, but to bring them to our festival so that people can see them in action. Eighteen years ago it was almost impossible to find any solar electric or solar thermal installations, but today solar has become mainstream, Solar electric and solar thermal is in use in almost every community.  Even national retail stores are getting into the game, putting large-scale solar electric installations on their rooftops. Today energy efficiency is a hot topic. Hybrid and electric cars are no longer viewed as only for environmentalist hippies; it’s just plain practical, <strong>saving energy saves money</strong> and everyone wants to do it.</p>
<h3><strong>But how?</strong></h3>
<p>Which technologies are best for each individual and how do you get the best deal, or find the best source of information or learn what is the most appropriate technology for you?  That’s where SolarFest continues to fill the need. We give people the chance to learn and explore the latest technologies, to re-learn old traditions (re-skilling), to get their feet wet, and to gather with others who are interested in learning the same things. Everything we do at the festival is an educational opportunity. A three-day sustainability conference, with extensive hands-on, in-depth, beginner and advanced workshops, displays of new and innovative technologies, opportunities to sit and talk at length with experts in the field and see world-class performances, all powered by renewable energy.</p>
<p><strong>The need for good information is as great as ever</strong>, and we are committed to redoubling our efforts to building our programming, to embrace and include all new technologies, to show the world that alternatives exist and they are affordable and practical, even in today’s busy world. <strong>But we need your help.</strong> With your backing and a successful Indiegogo campaign we will be able to reach more people and continue to do important work and maintain our affordable ticket prices. Our list for expansion includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Expand our reach and attract more and different people.</strong> We have made a strong commitment to keeping our ticket prices low so that we remain accessible to as many people as possible.</li>
<li>

<p> </p></div>","In the Beginning...
Eighteen years ago SolarFest was created from a dream (yes, literally!).  Today that dream would be fairly easy to accomplish, but eighteen years ago this dream was truly revolutionary. This was the birth of solar education on a new unchartered scale in Vermont and across New England. And indeed our founders were more than up to the challenge, they forged the way for what is now a thriving industry not only here in the beautiful hills of Vermont, but throughout the northeast. They proved it could be done, one festival at a time.
The concept has always been clear – provide education and hands-on experience with renewable energy sources and sustainable practices in an atmosphere of art and music. Bringing industry leaders, innovators, highly experienced users of renewable technologies and newcomers together in a family-friendly environment.  SolarFest demonstrates the possibility of a brighter planet in the bright, shiny package of great music, food, theater and family fun. This allows folks a weekend to relax, recharge and re-invent the way they look at energy, community, and their impact on the world.  Our goal is to encourage attendees and enthusiasts to become a part of the movement and embrace ideas and inspiration by spending a day, or all weekend in a fully renewable energy powered community seeing renewable solutions in use everywhere.
As we grew...
Over the years, we have become masters at combining superb family entertainment along with presentations by some of the region's most knowledgeable Renewable Energy and Sustainable Living experts.  We offer a special children's activity area (Kids Corner), and a wide variety of food, craft, renewable energy and sustainable living vendors. Our featured performers represent a far-ranging spectrum of styles and traditions from around the world. We provide plenty of space throughout the weekend for serendipitous encounters, conversation, dancing, hiking, camping, relaxation, and an overall celebration of our planet's beauty.
The premise is that real, concrete learning can only happen when all senses are stimulated and the creative side of people is allowed to come to the surface. Our event strives to provide the creative stimulation, a really great environment for learning, and countless things to learn, one weekend a year.  SolarFest has become a destination for information and inspiration by presenting our multiple messages basked in the glow of artful and creative experience. We strongly believe that this is the best vehicle for change in the world.
Ushering in the Next Generation...
Today one of our biggest challenges is not just trying to keep up with new technologies, but to bring them to our festival so that people can see them in action. Eighteen years ago it was almost impossible to find any solar electric or solar thermal installations, but today solar has become mainstream, Solar electric and solar thermal is in use in almost every community.  Even national retail stores are getting into the game, putting large-scale solar electric installations on their rooftops. Today energy efficiency is a hot topic. Hybrid and electric cars are no longer viewed as only for environmentalist hippies; it’s just plain practical, saving energy saves money and everyone wants to do it.
But how?
Which technologies are best for each individual and how do you get the best deal, or find the best source of information or learn what is the most appropriate technology for you?  That’s where SolarFest continues to fill the need. We give people the chance to learn and explore the latest technologies, to re-learn old traditions (re-skilling), to get their feet wet, and to gather with others who are interested in learning the same things. Everything we do at the festival is an educational opportunity. A three-day sustainability conference, with extensive hands-on, in-depth, beginner and advanced workshops, displays of new and innovative technologies, opportunities to sit and talk at length with experts in the field and see world-class performances, all powered by renewable energy.
The need for good information is as great as ever, and we are committed to redoubling our efforts to building our programming, to embrace and include all new technologies, to show the world that alternatives exist and they are affordable and practical, even in today’s busy world. But we need your help. With your backing and a successful Indiegogo campaign we will be able to reach more people and continue to do important work and maintain our affordable ticket prices. Our list for expansion includes:


Expand our reach and attract more and different people. We have made a strong commitment to keeping our ticket prices low so that we remain accessible to as many people as possible.

Keep our music top notch and world class. Many people come to the festival for the music, but when they look around and see a sustainable community and renewable energy technology in use they are inspired to live their lives in a more sustainable manner.

Expand our arts, theater and innovative technology opportunities both at our event and as an ongoing regional outreach program

Expand our conference workshop topics to include the newest technologies, more DIY options, more opportunities for industry trainings, and an expanded focus on climate change issues both at our event and through ongoing community outreach programs.

Make our workshops and educational content available year-round online, and on community public access television channels. 

Develop an online community resource for consumers to ask questions about renewable technologies and products and get honest, unbiased answers from industry experts and other members of the community.
This list is long, but we are confident that with your help, each item is within our reach. We have an unbelievable group of dedicated volunteers and staff, a completely committed board of trustees, and the work ethic to see this through. What we are lacking is the financial capacity to expand our vision. We hope you will share our enthusiasm and pledge your support.
We’ve come a long way in our eighteen years, but there is much more we can accomplish. There are so many people to reach and so much potential. Please help us continue to bring our unique and important brand of sustainability to the northeast and support SolarFest - The Next Generation.

<h2>Youthaiti - Building a Healthier Future in Rural Haiti</h2>
<p>Youthaiti is a 501 (c) (3) non-profit organization, now in its sixth year of helping people in rural Haiti develop sustainable sanitation and hygiene, and encouraging the recycling of human byproducts to enhance sustainable agriculture.</p>
<p><strong>We need your help to complete the next phase of building our Center For Sustainable Development in the village of Duchity, in the southwestern Haitian province of Grand'Anse.</strong></p>
<p><strong><img alt=""The arrow and star identify the location of Duchity, Grand'Anse in southwest Haiti"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/682072/pictures/original/20130228140852-haiti_map_with_star_and_arrow_and_caption.jpg?1362089331"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Duchity, Grand'Anse""/></strong></p>
<p><strong>The Youthaiti Center for Sustainable Development</strong> will spread our reach in the rural communities of southwest Haiti – far from the aid efforts centered in large cities – and will help more people develop practical, sustainable ways to break the cycles of poverty and disease that destroy far too many lives each year.</p>
<h3>THE PROBLEM</h3>
<p>When Gigi Pomerantz first visited Haiti in 2006 as a visiting health-care provider, she quickly learned that 85 percent of rural Haitians practice “open defecation” – in other words, they have no toilets at all, and feces and urine end up anywhere and everywhere. This often leads to the rapid spread of pathogens and parasites. More than 10 percent of Haitian children under the age of 5 die each year because inadequate sanitation is so pervasive in rural areas. Adults and children alike in many communities are infected with worms, chronic diarrhea and dangerous diseases, including  cholera, which can kill a person in hours without diagnosis and proper treatment.</p>
<p>Pomerantz founded Youthaiti in the town of Duchity, in the southwest Haitian province of Grand'Anse -- home to the the country's last indigenous forest land -- to help young people overcome these often devastating problems.</p>
<h3>WHAT WE'VE DONE SO FAR</h3>
<p>Youthaiti provides sanitation facilities and community education in hygiene and sustainable agriculture methods in Grand'Anse. So far: </p>
<ul>
<li>We've trained more than 120 community-based health workers in principles of ecological sanitation, improved hygiene, and the prevention, identification and treatment of diseases spread by inadequate disposal of human feces and urine.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>We've funded and built more than 15 “dry toilets” in rural community centers, which safely collect feces and urine so they can be treated and used as safe and effective agricultural fertilizer.<br/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/682067/pictures/original/20130227183220-tosa_west_toilet_with_two_guests.jpg?1362018739"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
</li>
<li>We've installed more than 120 “Arborloo” latrines that trap feces and urine below ground and beneath a concrete cap, where it can biodegrade safely. In time the waste turns into fertilizer, and the former arborloo site becomes home to a fruit tree or other beneficial planting.<br/><br/><img alt=""The Evolution of an Arborloo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/682052/pictures/original/20130228141854-arborloo_left_to_right_hesperian.jpg?1362089933"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>WHERE WE GO FROM HERE</h3>
<p>Youthaiti is building a permanent home in Duchity to continue providing sanitation, education and agriculture assistance in the community, and to extend our work to other communites in the region.</p>
<p><strong>The Youthaiti Center for Sustainable Development</strong> will serve as our base of operations, an education center, as a community gathering place, and as accommodations for people who travel from other communities for a day or a week of training programs.<br/><br/>The Center will provide many young Haitians with their first ""hands on"" experience with ecological technologies including rainwater harvesting, ecological toilets, permaculture gardening and using earthworms to improve composting.</p>
<p><strong>Phase One of the project is complete.</strong> Thanks to support from donors in the United States and the work of our staff and volunteers in Grand'Anse, we've acquired land and built the concrete foundation for our future home.<br/><br/>(See for yourself at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tDU64Fqi4I"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tDU64Fqi4I</a>)</p>
<h3>
<strong>We need your help to complete Phase Two:</strong> erecting the first section of the structure including kitchen and dining facilities, temporary sleeping space, equipment for composting, seed beds for future gardens and -- you guessed it -- an arborloo with handwashing facilities. </h3>
<h3>The cost of this phase is $10,000.</h3>
<p>Future phases will include:</p>
<p>Phase Three: Adding a large meeting room, a resource room and an indoor composting toilet, as well as starting a demonstration ""permaculture"" site using recycled human byproducts as fertilizer.</p>
<p>Phase Four: Building dormitory facilities for guests and a second indoor toilet.</p>

<p><b>The Project</b></p><p>In 2010 we bought an 8 acre
plot of land next to a small town called Lucio V. López near Rosario City.
Through our project, Suelo Común, we hope to create a place where multiple food
crops coexist -from groundcovers to edible trees, everything in between- by
exploring different natural organic farming techniques such as crop rotation
and high diversity plantation, which will not only promote healthier plants,
but also enrich the soil. </p>

<p>The Suelo Común Project is
a place where we will put into practice all aspects of ecological living. This includes
green construction, rain water collection and grey water recycling, reforestation,

plot of land next to a small town called Lucio V. López near Rosario City.
Through our project, Suelo Común, we hope to create a place where multiple food
crops coexist -from groundcovers to edible trees, everything in between- by
exploring different natural organic farming techniques such as crop rotation
and high diversity plantation, which will not only promote healthier plants,
but also enrich the soil. 

The Suelo Común Project is
a place where we will put into practice all aspects of ecological living. This includes
green construction, rain water collection and grey water recycling, reforestation,
an arboretum of native trees, a place to promote sustainable farming, a
horticulture book library, and a seed bank; all of which will be available to

<p>Je me prénomme Kathleen Goulet, j'ai 21
ans (et trop bientôt 22), je suis étudiante en dernière année à l'Université
d'Ottawa en Géographie. Une chose à dire: J'ADORE ÇA. La géographie m'a fait
grandir, découvrir le monde, et m'a fait voir et comprendre l'Homme d'un autre oeil. </p>
<p>Depuis que je suis toute jeune, mon rêve
était d'aller à l'Université. Lorsqu'à la petite école on nous a demandé
d'économiser, alors que mes collègues ramassaient leurs petits changes pour
s'acheter le nouveau Nintendo, moi, du haut de mes 10 ans, je gardais mon
argent pour un jour étudier à l'Université. Ce fut mon premier rêve, écrit en
gros dans mon tout premier carnet de compte Desjardins. </p>
<p>Aujourd'hui, je ne suis peut-être plus
la petite fille de 10 ans qui rêvait de devenir avocate, mais je suis toujours
aussi passionnée. Apprendre m'apporte tellement, j'en savoure encore toutes les
couleurs. Dans moins d'un an, je vais pouvoir cocher « check » à mon
rêve de petite fille et tenir fièrement mon diplôme entre mes mains. </p>

À l'aube de mes 22
ans (3 mars prochain oh la la), j'ai entrepris un projet qui me tient beaucoup
à coeur, un autre rêve de petite fille, mais un peu plus refoulé. Curieuse et
passionnée de nature, le monde m'a toujours intéressé. Les gens dans le bus à
coté de moi, comme ceux de l'autre coté de l'océan, j'aime les gens d'amour
&lt;3. J'ai toujours voulu sortir de ma zone de confort pour aller apprendre de l'autre, partager une culture, des savoirs et des
regards. <p></p><p></p><p></p><h3></h3><h3>De la géographie à l'environnement en passant par la solidarité internationale</h3><p></p><p></p>
<p>Mon BACC en géographie me permet
aujourd'hui de réaliser cela. À travers ces nouvelles connaissances
géographiques sur l'Homme, j'en suis arrivée à aimer la terre d'amour aussi.
L'environnement qui nous entoure est précieux et mes études m'ont permis de
vraiment le comprendre. Il était important que mon dernier stage soit en
lien avec l'environnement. </p>
<p>Grâce au programme Québec Sans Frontière
(<a href=""http://www.mrifce.gouv.qc.ca/qsf/)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.mrifce.gouv.qc.ca/qsf/)</a> et le Comité Régional d'Éducation pour le Développement
International de Lanaudière (<a href=""http://www.credil.qc.ca/)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.credil.qc.ca/)</a>, j'ai donc la
chance de partir cet été avec 8 autres jeunes (tous aussi passionnés), dans la
région d'Ayacucho au Pérou pour réaliser un stage de solidarité internationale
en lien avec l’environnement, la santé et l'énergie thermique.</p>
<p>Nous allons concevoir et installer, en
partenariat avec la population locale, des chauffe-eaux solaires. Ces
chauffe-eaux, fait à partir de matériaux recyclés, auront pour but de réduire
l’exposition aux matières toxiques issues de la combustion liée au
réchauffement de l’eau destinée à la consommation familiale. La pollution de
l’air intérieur due à la combustion a des effets nocifs sur la santé des gens.
Ce projet contribuera aussi à l'assainissement de l'environnement local dans
cette communauté puisque nous participerons à mettre sur pieds des collectes de
déchets organiques et inorganiques, et nous offrirons des ateliers de
sensibilisation en matière de santé et d'environnement. </p>
<p>Pour mener à terme ce projet, chaque stagiaire
s'engage à amasser une somme de 2000$, en date d'aujourd'hui, il me reste
environ 1000$ à amasser. Cet argent servira strictement à porter à terme notre
super projet, ce montant ne couvre que les frais relatifs au séjour à
l'étranger. </p>
<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3></h3><h3>Comprendre ailleurs pour agir ici</h3><p></p>
<p>Ce projet me tiens à coeur et je tiens à
le partager avec vous. Votre appuie et vos dons me permettraient, oui de
réaliser un rêve, mais aussi de créer un projet innovateur avec la communauté
de San Melchor et mon équipe du tonnerre. </p>
<p>Ce projet en lien avec la santé,
l'environnement et l'énergie thermique est oui certainement une occasion de
partager et d'échanger nos connaissances scientifiques avec les gens du Pérou,
mais c'est aussi l'occasion de s'immerger dans une autre culture, de la vivre
et de la comprendre. Le changement il ne se fera pas au Pérou, on ne part pas
pour changer les autres, on part pour revenir et changer ici dans notre
communauté. Comme le dis si bien le slogan du CRÉDIL, il faut comprendre
ailleurs pour agir ici. </p>
<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Participez vous aussi à ce projet</h3><p></p>
<p>Ce projet vous tient aussi à coeur?
Participez y en m'aidant dans mes levées de fonds. Vos dons seront appréciés,
mais votre soutien encore plus. N'hésitez pas à partager mon projet avec vos
amis, collègues et connaissances. <br/><br/>

coté de moi, comme ceux de l'autre coté de l'océan, j'aime les gens d'amour
<3. J'ai toujours voulu sortir de ma zone de confort pour aller apprendre de l'autre, partager une culture, des savoirs et des
regards. De la géographie à l'environnement en passant par la solidarité internationale
Mon BACC en géographie me permet
aujourd'hui de réaliser cela. À travers ces nouvelles connaissances
géographiques sur l'Homme, j'en suis arrivée à aimer la terre d'amour aussi.
L'environnement qui nous entoure est précieux et mes études m'ont permis de
vraiment le comprendre. Il était important que mon dernier stage soit en
lien avec l'environnement. 
Grâce au programme Québec Sans Frontière
(http://www.mrifce.gouv.qc.ca/qsf/) et le Comité Régional d'Éducation pour le Développement
International de Lanaudière (http://www.credil.qc.ca/), j'ai donc la
chance de partir cet été avec 8 autres jeunes (tous aussi passionnés), dans la
région d'Ayacucho au Pérou pour réaliser un stage de solidarité internationale
en lien avec l’environnement, la santé et l'énergie thermique.
Nous allons concevoir et installer, en
partenariat avec la population locale, des chauffe-eaux solaires. Ces
chauffe-eaux, fait à partir de matériaux recyclés, auront pour but de réduire
l’exposition aux matières toxiques issues de la combustion liée au
réchauffement de l’eau destinée à la consommation familiale. La pollution de
l’air intérieur due à la combustion a des effets nocifs sur la santé des gens.
Ce projet contribuera aussi à l'assainissement de l'environnement local dans
cette communauté puisque nous participerons à mettre sur pieds des collectes de
déchets organiques et inorganiques, et nous offrirons des ateliers de
sensibilisation en matière de santé et d'environnement. 
Pour mener à terme ce projet, chaque stagiaire
s'engage à amasser une somme de 2000$, en date d'aujourd'hui, il me reste
environ 1000$ à amasser. Cet argent servira strictement à porter à terme notre
super projet, ce montant ne couvre que les frais relatifs au séjour à
l'étranger. 
Comprendre ailleurs pour agir ici
Ce projet me tiens à coeur et je tiens à
le partager avec vous. Votre appuie et vos dons me permettraient, oui de
réaliser un rêve, mais aussi de créer un projet innovateur avec la communauté
de San Melchor et mon équipe du tonnerre. 
Ce projet en lien avec la santé,
l'environnement et l'énergie thermique est oui certainement une occasion de
partager et d'échanger nos connaissances scientifiques avec les gens du Pérou,
mais c'est aussi l'occasion de s'immerger dans une autre culture, de la vivre
et de la comprendre. Le changement il ne se fera pas au Pérou, on ne part pas
pour changer les autres, on part pour revenir et changer ici dans notre
communauté. Comme le dis si bien le slogan du CRÉDIL, il faut comprendre
ailleurs pour agir ici. 
Participez vous aussi à ce projet
Ce projet vous tient aussi à coeur?
Participez y en m'aidant dans mes levées de fonds. Vos dons seront appréciés,
mais votre soutien encore plus. N'hésitez pas à partager mon projet avec vos
amis, collègues et connaissances. 
De plus, suiviez nous durant tout notre séjour en pays péruvien en vous rendant
sur notre page facebook.

<h3><strong> </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Who we are?</strong></h3>
<p>Hi. We're The Green Ark. We are a grass-root organization from Skopje, Macedonia. We are about 15 people all joined together with a single goal: to protect, preserve and improve upon our surrounding environment. Starting from 2007 we are actively working in accordance with the principles of Permaculture to make a difference in peoples everyday lives by giving workshops on making organic soap, building herb spirals, building with straw bales, methods of composting, filtration of water, making seed balls, guerrilla gardening... </p>
<p>Our current project is to establish the first Educational &amp; Research Center for Permaculture in our country. We have already jump-started the project by organizing a fundraising concert asking for local support, but as you are well aware, a project of this size and the reconstruction itself can be quite expensive. That is why we turn to you, all the environmentally aware eco-logicians and naturally generous people out there to join us and help us raise the much needed funds. We simply need your help.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What is the project about?</strong></h3>
<p>After two years of negotiations, the local authorities have granted us the use of a former school building over the next 20 years for the purpose of establishing the Educational &amp; Research Center for Permaculture. The agreement is that we take care of the reconstruction of the object dating from the 1930s, and it is completely up to us to make it operational again. We are now taking step one, and that is to reconstruct the roof and convert it into a green roof.</p>
<p>Our plan is to initiate parts of the educational program that can be applied through hands-on experience during the reconstruction of the object itself by organizing workshops for restoration and refurbishment with minimal impact to the environment. We will explore the posibilities to engage people who want to learn and practice these building techniques and appropriate technologies, and will seize each opportunity to turn every single step of the process of establishing the Educational &amp; Research Center for Permaculture into a learning experience open for all who want to do it.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact </h3>
<p>The work done in the Center will incite significant positive changes, over the years to come, in the community of the village Sermenin and the region by empowering people to make their first steps in the transition towards self-sustainability within healthy ecosystems. We will be inviting people all over the world to learn and exchange knowledge &amp; experience with us and the local population. The Educational &amp; Research Center for Permaculture in Sermenin will grow to be the hub of numerous environmental, social, cultural and economic initiatives in the region, supporting diverse innovative collaborations. You could take part in the growth as well! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What we are asking for?</strong></h3>
<p>- We are looking for help &amp; funds to reconstruct the roof of the school building</p>
<p>- Fixing the roof will really help get the ball rolling for the whole project</p>
<p>- A fixed roof allows the rest of the building to get refurbished on time </p>
<p>- An operational building will provide working space and shelter to students, as well as, storage for material &amp; equipment<br/><strong><br/></strong>So we're turning to you to support our efforts by asking for your kind and generous contributions. In exchange, we're offering you the opportunity to learn and practice Permaculture with us, adopt a beehive, get hands-on experience and hand made soap to wash it down, taste berries, fruits, honey... Your contribution will help us to reconstruct the roof in a sustainable manner using appropriate technologies, not harming the environment extensively during the process, and further, it will help us to continue with the work on establishing the first Educational &amp; Research Center for Permaculture in Macedonia. </p>
<p>As a kind thank you for your help and support we will give our best to make you a part of this rewarding and beneficial project.</p>

Otherwise the structure might not remain standing over the next winter.</p>
<p>We are firmly determined to establish the Educational &amp; Research Center for Permaculture in Sermenin. In case we do not reach the final amount we asked for, any amount raised will still be used to buy the materials needed for the reconstruction. The same applies if we are fortunate to receive a greater amount than we asked for, it will all be invested in the following stages of reconstruction on the other parts of the building.</p>

As you can see from the table above, we need to raise over 20000 dollars, if we take into acount the additional costs for the transport and the expert supervisor, to cover the cost of reconstructing the roof of the almost ruined building of the future Educational & Research Center for Permaculture. Otherwise the structure might not remain standing over the next winter.
We are firmly determined to establish the Educational & Research Center for Permaculture in Sermenin. In case we do not reach the final amount we asked for, any amount raised will still be used to buy the materials needed for the reconstruction. The same applies if we are fortunate to receive a greater amount than we asked for, it will all be invested in the following stages of reconstruction on the other parts of the building.

<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What Do We Need To Do - WE NEED TO ACT AND ACT NOW!!!</h3>
<p>Many feel that the solution to these problems is the intoduction of Anti Poaching Units and although effective on the ""front line"" they do nothing but inflate the value of  animal horns, tusks and bones. A parallel can quite easily be drawn with the illegal drug traficking problems of the world - the more difficult it is to get the higher the price people will pay.</p>
<p>A more effective approach is to educate those who believe in the myths surrounding traditional mediines and so called ""magic"" potions and to show them through education that what they believe is not true at all. We plan on doing this through the publication of 1,000,000 booklets to be distributed throughout China, Vietnam and Laos (the main importers and users of Rhino Horn, Tiger &amp; Lion bones). The booklets, translated into local languages and will display graphic pictures of slaughtered Rhino, Lions &amp; Tigers and will include scientific evidence proving that using such potions has no medicinal value whatsoever. We will distribute these booklets through Animal Rights in China (ARC), <span style=""color: #666666; font-family: Impact;"">Chinese Animal Protection Network</span> (CAPN), Chinese Companion Animal Protection Network (CCAPN), The Philippine Animal Welfare Society, Education For Nature Vietnam (ENV). <a href=""http://www.savingrhinos.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.savingrhinos.org</a> &amp; <a href=""http://www.rhinorage.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.rhinorage.org</a> are also assisiting with and will benefit from this campaign.These organisations will carry the message through to city dwellers and those living in city and rural communities. Funds will be used to produce the full colour booklets, aid in the distribution of them, with at least $50,000 being split among these organisation to make sure they are able to get our inmportant messages out there into the communities and carry on their good work.</p>
</div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Combined efforts of education by use of easy to read and understand but graphic booklets, plus local community work will eventually have a huge impact on demand for these so called aphrodisiacs, sex potions and ornamental objects. 1,000,000 booklets, each read by 5 people will help us achieve our goal of educating at least 5,000,000 people. Most people in the East have no idea of what these animals have to go through for them to wear or consume such unecessary objects. Lowering demand has to be our number one priority if we are to save our Lions, Tigers, Elephants and Rhino's for our future generations to enjoy. Please, let's all come together and act now before it's too late!</p>
<h3>How The Funds Will Be Used</h3>
<p>Most of the funding will be used for the production of the booklets with an estimnated cost of 20c per booklet (includes distribution costs). This means that at least $200,000 (1,000,000 x .20c) of funding is needed to cover this. We are also hoping to raise an additional $50,000 to be divided among the various groups taking part in this well needed excercise. Of course - perks need to be paid for from this too. </p>
<h3> Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Any amount from $1 upwards will all add up and help us to achieve what we really must do. If you for any reason cannot help with as little as a $1 then please share this campaign with those you think can.</p>

 nut trees. Around and below you, there are shrubs and many other types 
of plants, bearing fruits, vegetables and herbs free for the taking. 
These are the basics of a food forest.  A Food Forest is an age-old 
agricultural strategy where people plant diverse types of edible, 
climate appropriate plants that form strong, mutually supportive 
relationships, creating a system that sustains itself over time.  Food 
forests produce abundant food, with minimal maintenance – humans 
design with nature to let nature work on her own.East Austin's rich soil and dedicated neighbors have cared for pecan, plum, loquat and citrus trees for generations. Food forestry is a strategy that can help protect this natural tranquility and neighborhood heritage even as we face increasing water scarcity. Who we areEast Feast  is a coalition of diverse community members dedicated to cultivating food and community together in East Austin, Texas. We are a subsidiary of Urban Patchwork Neighborhood Farms 
(UP). East Feast is currently working to establish the first 
food forest in a public park in Austin, Texas!  The Festival Beach Food 
Forest will be a place for visitors to connect, grow, and celebrate.Since its inception in 2012, we have grown from an idea to a grassroots movement for local, healthy, affordable food, with an ordinance to prove it!   Neighbors of the site have rallied to support the Festival Beach Food Forest, including  the RBJ Residential Center (a mixed income community and independent living center for seniors and people with disabilities), the Festival Beach Community Garden, nearby neighborhood associations, and public schools.  East Feast partners also include like-minded organizations such as PODER (People Organized in Defense of Earth and Her Resources), the Sustainable Food Center, Austin EcoNetwork, Austin Permaculture Guild, and Food is Free, just to name a few.  Through this network of diverse partners, we are working to ensure that many generations of Austinites learn how fun, easy, and essential good food is. We invite you to learn more about the Festival Beach Food Forest at www.festivalbeach.org.Food Forest LayersWhat We Need 
Right now, we are looking for $25,000 to start the first phase of the Festival
Beach Food Forest.  This funding will pay
for the initial earthworks, tools, permitting fees, and the initial planting.  These fund will also make sure that we can maintain the Festival Beach Food Forest and prove it is a viable use of public lands.  We are currently exploring other sources of
funding but your contribution will help us get shovels in the ground during the
spring planting season.  
As a special thank you for contributing to this amazing
project, we have several perks available for contributors.  Below is a list of some of the available
perks.

The Impact
East Feast is proud to announce that on August 28th, 2014, the city council unanimously approved the creation of The Festival Beach Food Forest (FBFF). This ordinance was a milestone for us, and represents an important step forward in the future of food security (and food fun) for our city! The unanimously approved ordinance allows for the creation of a fence-free edible Eden on 2/3 acres of park land. There all citizens are welcomed to learn about food forestry and experience the beauty of an edible oasis in the heart of Austin! Festival Beach Food Forest planThe Festival Beach Food Forest will
provide the first edible forest garden in a public park in the City of Austin.  The goal of the food forest is to remind
people where their food comes from and to provide organic sustainably grown
food to the local community.  Another key goal is to demonstrate how we can design low-water, low-maintenance edible landscapes throughout the city by designing with nature. Just like a natural forest ecosystem, a healthy food forest has multiple 
levels that support one another. Fruit and nut trees are the upper level, while below are berry 
shrubs, as well as a mix of other edible plants that benefit from the 
shade of the canopy trees.  Some supporting plants are strategically 
included to attract beneficial insects for natural pest management.  
Other plants are included to make the soil healthier by providing

Although we are currently in need of funds to start
implementation, we understand that contributing financially is not always

<p>This year marks the 100 year anniversary of the Los Angeles Aqueduct. In February 1913, the City of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) closed the “gates,” which they had constructed on the Owens River, and completely diverted all of the river's flow into their newly-constructed aqueduct. Many miles of scenic river, vast meadows, and an entire inland lake were thus deprived of water. This act forever altered the socio-economic and ecological landscape of the Owens Valley. Those of us who live here, and those who visit, experience the repercussions of this important event on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Today, the LADWP, one of the largest utilities in the country with an annual budget of 4.8 billion dollars, continues its destructive water policies.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>People once dreamed of living under the sea. Today, we are not only doing it,<br/>but also using undersea living as an extraordinary tool to conduct cutting-edge<br/>coral reef research, test innovative undersea equipment and tele-robotic surgical<br/>instruments, train the next generation of astronauts and sailors, and to inspire<br/>future generations of scientists, educators and leaders.</p>
<p>Through the extended bottom time provided by Aquarius, the precious gift<br/>of time, marine scientists have begun to find the answers to many questions<br/>facing policy makers and managers responsible for the wise use of our national<br/>resources. Results address the use of marine reserves as a management tool to<br/>conserve coral reef fisheries, understanding coral feeding biology and<br/>reproduction, figuring out the impacts of elevated seawater temperature on coral biology and so much more.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the President’s 2013 budget proposal includes the termination of the National Undersea Research Program (NURP), which includes Aquarius.</p>
<p>Aquarius' Annual Operating Budget is $3M.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>With government funding for Aquarius set to end in December, the Aquarius Foundation has set a goal of raising $750,000 by December 31, 2012. Achieving this fundraising goal will allow Aquarius to maintain core staff and undertake critical maintenance in 2013 in preparation for a full mission season in 2014.

<h3>Why Aquarius is Important</h3>
<p>Examples of recent scientific studies conducted using Aquarius:</p>
<p>• A team of scientists discovered that internal waves bring as much as 20-40 times more nitrogen and phosphorus to the upper Florida Keys outer reef tract than estimates of nutrient pollution from sewage and storm water runoff.<br/>• Collaborative research on coral reefs revealed surprisingly high pumping<br/>rates and rates of nitrogen exchange in reef sponges. A ‘denitrifying effect’ of some sponges, which may counteract other sponge nitrification to help maintain the health of a reef system, has also been identified.<br/>• Coral restoration and resilience experiments have been conducted since 2007 to increase understanding of the factors that affect the survival of coral transplants as a way to begin restore damaged reefs.<br/>• Experiments to determine how herbivore diversity may be most productively managed to restore damaged reefs to desired states of health and ecosystem function.<br/>• Scientsits have begun to zero in on the causes of ocean acidification, which is contributing to the degradation of coral reefs. Of particular interest: whether some acidification might be caused by respiration of bottom-dwelling creatures like sponges, or whether most can be attributed to carbon emissions from an industrialized world. </p>
<p>Besides accomplishing their intended goals, scientists are able to see and<br/>experience the unexpected, at any time of day or night, and new revelations<br/>await — like the discovery of a marine plant or animal that could produce the<br/>next wonder drug.</p>
<p>Operational since 1993, Aquarius has given scientists prolonged access to the<br/>seabed, a unique opportunity to observer the oceanic ecosystem consistently<br/>and over time.

<p>The Aquarius gives scientist and divers extended presence in a real underwater<br/>environment that is not available through traditional scuba diving or shore-<br/>based testing facilities. For testing and evaluation of underwater equipment,<br/>this provides unprecedented ability to install, trouble shoot, and monitor the<br/>performance of undersea equipment. This capability is applies to development<br/>and testing of cutting edge technologies that are needed in ocean observing,<br/>forecasting and modeling; and reef monitoring and restoration; as well as<br/>extreme environment and telepresence testing for remote exploration and<br/>medical procedures.</p>
<p>The similarities between living in space and undersea provide a unique means<br/>for NASA to prepare for extreme environments. Aquarius provides NASA with an analog training environment that simulates both the International Space Station (ISS) and moon/Mars exploration missions with realism not available in other analog environments.

Catastrophic asteroid impacts have happened before -- and they will happen again. NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations (NEEMO) used the Aquarius undersea laboratory to test innovative solutions to engineering challenges that will be faced by a potential manned mission to an asteroid. Additionally,</p>
<p>• The undersea habitat provides an optimum environment for the crew to practice extravehicular activity preparation and maneuvers.</p>
<p>• The isolation and constrained aquanaut quarters, the harsh environment and reduced gravity presents challenges similar to those that will be encountered during a deep space mission.</p>
<p>NASA has also used Aquarius to better understand the rigors of space life on the<br/>human body:</p>
<p>• Studies of how the pressurized environment affects sleep and the body’s immune system, the growth of bacteria in the habitat, the use of wireless medical monitoring equipment and nutrition-related studies.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
People once dreamed of living under the sea. Today, we are not only doing it,but also using undersea living as an extraordinary tool to conduct cutting-edgecoral reef research, test innovative undersea equipment and tele-robotic surgicalinstruments, train the next generation of astronauts and sailors, and to inspirefuture generations of scientists, educators and leaders.
Through the extended bottom time provided by Aquarius, the precious giftof time, marine scientists have begun to find the answers to many questionsfacing policy makers and managers responsible for the wise use of our nationalresources. Results address the use of marine reserves as a management tool toconserve coral reef fisheries, understanding coral feeding biology andreproduction, figuring out the impacts of elevated seawater temperature on coral biology and so much more.
Unfortunately the President’s 2013 budget proposal includes the termination of the National Undersea Research Program (NURP), which includes Aquarius.
Aquarius' Annual Operating Budget is $3M.

<br/>Kurzbeschreibung</h3>
<p>Hi, ich habe immer wieder Visionen und Ideen und freue mich über jede Unterstützung bei der Realisierung.</p>
<p><b>Wer bin ich? </b><br/>Ich bin ein 33 Jähriger junger Mann, verheiratet und Vater einer süßen Töchter die im Januar 2013 geboren wurde. <br/>Im Job leite ich ein Team ca. 14 Personen in einem Auftragslabor. <br/>In welchem wir Proben jeder Art auf Umweltschadstoffe untersuchen. </p>
<p><b>Was habe ich vor?</b><br/>Ich werde mich ab Oktober 2013 bis August 2014 zum Imker fortbilden und möchte anschließend mindestens 3 Bienenvölker in Hamburg Rahlstedt aufstellen.</p>
<p><b>Warum?<br/></b>Bienen produzieren nicht nur Honig für den Frühstückstisch, sondern bestäuben 80% aller Obst und Blütengehölze. Andere Insekten erledigen den Rest. Durch Bienen wird der Ertrag bis um das 10 fache gesteigert aber leider ist in den letzten Jahren ein deutliches Bienensterben zu verzeichnen. <br/>Weniger Bienen schaden dem gesamten Ökosystem.<br/>Die heutigen Bienen sind durch Züchtung äußerst friedlich.<br/>Aufgrund von Monokulturen auf den Feldern und vermehrter Einsatz von Pestiziden ist heutzutage auf dem Land die Ernährung der Bienenvölker kaum noch sicherzustellen. In den Großstätten liefern, Kleingärten, Friedhöfe und Parks über das ganze Jahr ein ausreichendes Blütenangebot.</p>
<p>Mit eurer Unterstützung möchte ich mindestens 3 Völker in Hamburg Rahlstedt aufstellen und das dafür benötigte Zubehör finanzieren.</p>
<h3>Was wir brauchen &amp; Was man bekommt</h3>
<p><b>Für meine Vision benötige ich 2500€ welche sich wie folgt zusammensetzen:</b><br/></p>
<ul>
<li>150€ Lehrgangskosten</li>
<li>500€ für 3 Beuten so heißen die Bienenhäuser :-)</li>
<li>600€ für eine Honigschleuder <br/>
</li>
<li>600€ für 3 Bienenvölker mit je 10 Waben</li>
<li>100€ für einen Imkeranzug</li>
<li>100€ für Literatur<br/>
</li>
<li>120€  für Entdeckelungsgeschier</li>
<li>50€ für Schädlingsbekämpfung (Viren, Milben etc.)<br/>
</li>
<li>30€ für einen Smoker ( Räuchern zum beruhigen der Bienen)</li>
<li>120 € für Mittelwände</li>
<li>30€ für ein Honigsieb</li>
<li>30€ für ein Honigrührgerät</li>
<li>20€ für Gläser für euch ;-)</li>
<li>140€ für Rämchen</li>
<li>30€ für Schwarmfangbeutel<br/>
</li>
<li>20€ für Honigeimer</li>
<li>20€ für Kleingerät</li>
<li>10€ für einen Zerstäuber</li>
<li>10€ Stockmeißel zum lösen der Waben<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Natürlich gibt es viele Dinge auch in günstigeren Versionen in der Bucht zu kaufen, aber die meisten dürften bereits die Erfahrung gemacht haben, das günstig ganz schnell teuer werden kann.<br/></p>

<b>Was habt Ihr davon?</b><br/>Ihr möchtet mich unterstützen? Super, natürlich sollt Ihr auch etwas davon haben...<br/><ul>
<li>Ab dem ersten € gibt es Bild von mir im Imkeranzug bei den Bienchen. Da erst alles vorhanden sein muss kann dieses Bild natürlich erst am Ende des gesamten Projektes entstehen.<br/>
</li>
<li>Jeder der sich mit mindestens 10€ beteiligt bekommt von allen Lehrgangsterminen jeweils ein Foto per Mail. (10.2013 bis 08.2014)</li>

</li>
<li>Ab 25€ erhalten sie die obigen Bilder sowie Bilder von den aufgestellten Beuten, einen Nachweis der Ausgaben und Bilder der gekauften Artikel (10.2013 bis 08.2014) und das 30g Probierglas Honig in 2015<br/>
</li>
<li>Ab 30€ kommt in 2015 ein 250g Glas Honig per Post<br/>
</li>
<li>Ab 50€ gibt´s ein 500g Glas Honig per Post<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Die Auswirkung</h3>Durch euch werden im Bereich von 50km² um Rahlstedt mehr Obstbäume und Blühpflanzen bestäubt, ihr leistet einen Beitrag gegen das Bienensterben und ermöglicht meiner Tochter und ihren zukünftigen Freunden einen Einblick in die Zusammenhänge in der Natur 
<h3>Andere Wege, wie man helfen kann:</h3>
<p>Ihr findet das Projekt gut könnt mich aber nicht finanziell unterstützen?</p>
<ul>
<li>wenn ihr einen Garten habt, egal wo, pflanzt mehr Blühpflanzen, Obst und Gemüse. Buchsbäume und co. mögen nett aussehen liefern aber keine Nahrung</li>
<li>empfehlt diese Kampagne einfach über diese Plattform, euer soziales Netzwerk oder durch Mundpropaganda weiter.</li>
<li>Ihr habt eine freie Ecke in eurem Garten oder seid in der Politik tätig und kenn freistehende Nieschen? Dann stellt sie eurem regionalen Imkerverein zur Verfügung um dort Bienenstöcke aufzustellen. Im Bereich von HH-Rahlstedt auch gerne mir ;-)</li>

Warum?Bienen produzieren nicht nur Honig für den Frühstückstisch, sondern bestäuben 80% aller Obst und Blütengehölze. Andere Insekten erledigen den Rest. Durch Bienen wird der Ertrag bis um das 10 fache gesteigert aber leider ist in den letzten Jahren ein deutliches Bienensterben zu verzeichnen. Weniger Bienen schaden dem gesamten Ökosystem.Die heutigen Bienen sind durch Züchtung äußerst friedlich.Aufgrund von Monokulturen auf den Feldern und vermehrter Einsatz von Pestiziden ist heutzutage auf dem Land die Ernährung der Bienenvölker kaum noch sicherzustellen. In den Großstätten liefern, Kleingärten, Friedhöfe und Parks über das ganze Jahr ein ausreichendes Blütenangebot.
Mit eurer Unterstützung möchte ich mindestens 3 Völker in Hamburg Rahlstedt aufstellen und das dafür benötigte Zubehör finanzieren.
Was wir brauchen & Was man bekommt
Für meine Vision benötige ich 2500€ welche sich wie folgt zusammensetzen:

150€ Lehrgangskosten
500€ für 3 Beuten so heißen die Bienenhäuser :-)
600€ für eine Honigschleuder 

600€ für 3 Bienenvölker mit je 10 Waben
100€ für einen Imkeranzug
100€ für Literatur

120€  für Entdeckelungsgeschier
50€ für Schädlingsbekämpfung (Viren, Milben etc.)

30€ für einen Smoker ( Räuchern zum beruhigen der Bienen)
120 € für Mittelwände
30€ für ein Honigsieb
30€ für ein Honigrührgerät
20€ für Gläser für euch ;-)
140€ für Rämchen
30€ für Schwarmfangbeutel

20€ für Honigeimer
20€ für Kleingerät
10€ für einen Zerstäuber
10€ Stockmeißel zum lösen der Waben


Natürlich gibt es viele Dinge auch in günstigeren Versionen in der Bucht zu kaufen, aber die meisten dürften bereits die Erfahrung gemacht haben, das günstig ganz schnell teuer werden kann.
Jeder Euro der eingeht wird in die oben genannten Dinge investiert.Was passiert wenn die Summe nicht erreicht wird? Auch wenn die Gesamtsumme nicht erreicht wird, starte ich mit der Imkerei. Dann werden es am Anfang nur zwei Völker oder nur eins und die Schleuder sowie das Zubehör kommen erst später... 
Sollte etwas übrig bleiben... investiere ich dies in weitere Beuten und Völker
Was habt Ihr davon?Ihr möchtet mich unterstützen? Super, natürlich sollt Ihr auch etwas davon haben...
Ab dem ersten € gibt es Bild von mir im Imkeranzug bei den Bienchen. Da erst alles vorhanden sein muss kann dieses Bild natürlich erst am Ende des gesamten Projektes entstehen.

Jeder der sich mit mindestens 10€ beteiligt bekommt von allen Lehrgangsterminen jeweils ein Foto per Mail. (10.2013 bis 08.2014)
Ab 15€ gibt es ein 30g Probierglas Honig in 2015

Ab 25€ erhalten sie die obigen Bilder sowie Bilder von den aufgestellten Beuten, einen Nachweis der Ausgaben und Bilder der gekauften Artikel (10.2013 bis 08.2014) und das 30g Probierglas Honig in 2015

Ab 30€ kommt in 2015 ein 250g Glas Honig per Post

Ab 50€ gibt´s ein 500g Glas Honig per Post


Die AuswirkungDurch euch werden im Bereich von 50km² um Rahlstedt mehr Obstbäume und Blühpflanzen bestäubt, ihr leistet einen Beitrag gegen das Bienensterben und ermöglicht meiner Tochter und ihren zukünftigen Freunden einen Einblick in die Zusammenhänge in der Natur 
Andere Wege, wie man helfen kann:
Ihr findet das Projekt gut könnt mich aber nicht finanziell unterstützen?

wenn ihr einen Garten habt, egal wo, pflanzt mehr Blühpflanzen, Obst und Gemüse. Buchsbäume und co. mögen nett aussehen liefern aber keine Nahrung
empfehlt diese Kampagne einfach über diese Plattform, euer soziales Netzwerk oder durch Mundpropaganda weiter.
Ihr habt eine freie Ecke in eurem Garten oder seid in der Politik tätig und kenn freistehende Nieschen? Dann stellt sie eurem regionalen Imkerverein zur Verfügung um dort Bienenstöcke aufzustellen. Im Bereich von HH-Rahlstedt auch gerne mir ;-)

<p>We want to make an album of the most soulful Christmas carols, sung entirely by whales.</p>
<p>Some of us love the winter holidays, but for many it has lost its magic and much of the sacredness, warmth and connection seem to have been replaced by commercial jingles and the frenzy of shopping.</p>
<p>Using our species’ fascination and affinity for whales, we are creating a unique and personal connection to the grace and wonder of the season. And perhaps even a new joy that we had not experienced before.</p>

<p><em>Whale Christmas </em>is a completely original album of traditional Christmas songs that connects listeners to the deep spirituality of the holiday while encouraging a direct experience of the sacredness of nature.</p>
<p>A variety of natural whale voices will be digitally sampled, shaped and arranged into classic holiday carols. These songs will be orchestrated to a tempo reflecting the natural speed and rhythm of whale sounds in the wild. Only songs of an inherent soulful nature (such as <em>Silent Night</em>) will be used for the project (<em>Jingle Bells </em>will <strong>not </strong>be included).</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>We Are Cove Point is a campaign created by local residents from Lusby, MD and allies from across the United States to stop the construction of the first LNG (liquefied natural gas, aka fracked gas) export terminal on the East coast. It is being built by Dominion on the shore of the Chesapeake Bay.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the reasons why this export terminal must be stopped:</p>
<p>1. It sets a dangerous precedent as the first fracked gas refinery to be built in a densely populated area, literally across the street from homes and next to youth sports fields. With ten more export facilities planned in the US, we don't want other communities to be threatened like we are.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span></p>
<p></p>
<p>2. Not only does the risk of a catastrophic explosion or chemical spill threaten the families of Cove Point, but the facility will spew 20.4 tons of cancer and disease causing toxins as well as 3.3 million tons of Greenhouse Gases into the air each year. Dominion bought pollution credits that allow them to poison the local community.</p>
<p>3. The export facility will drive construction of more pipelines, compressor stations and fracking rigs from Massachusetts to North Carolina which will place more communities at risk of catastrophic events and poisoning of their air, land and water. This export terminal is to the Marcellus Shale what the Keystone XL and other pipelines are to the Alberta tar sands. Gas corporations need export terminals to send fracked gas overseas where prices are higher in order to make fracking profitable.</p>
<p>4. The carbon in the East coast’s Marcellus Shale, which covers 7 states, must stay in the ground. Like the Alberta Tar Sands, it is a carbon bomb that will amplify the climate crisis.</p>
<p>Although construction of the export terminal has started, it will take more than three years to complete. This gives us enough time to build opposition to stop it.</p>
<p>We Are Cove Point is a coalition of local residents and allies who are committed to working together to do what it takes nonviolently and creatively to stop this export terminal. Some of us are active in local groups that have been pushing legislators to commission safety studies. Some of us have and continue to use the judicial process. And some of us are experienced activists who are deeply committed to climate and environmental justice.</p>
<p>We see great potential for this campaign to grow and succeed with your support. In three weeks we were able to organize a nonviolent direct action training in Lusby and then held three days packed with actions. The response by the local residents was very positive. This is a community that is ready to fight back against Dominion. All it needs are some resources to aid them in organizing and taking action.</p>
<p>Your donation will have a tremendous impact on many families and communities and will help close the door on the fossil fuel era and open the way to a clean sustainable energy economy that will mitigate the climate crisis. </p>

If we can raise $20,000 through this effort, it will be enough for us to get started. We will be able to hire our organizer and print materials so that we can begin door-to-door canvassing in the neighborhood. This canvassing is essential so that we can raise more awareness of the dangers of the export terminal and so that we can listen to our neighbors and hear their concerns and ideas. The canvassing will be followed by public educational events including movie nights and powerpoint presentations with discussions afterwards.</p>
<p>In the spring, we will hold a weekend of community art building in preparation for a permitted parade through the neighborhood and to the gates of Dominion where we will display what the community wants to see in that space for a healthy and sustainable future. We will conclude that event with a potluck where we will provide lawn signs for families to take home and display.</p>
<p>We also have plans for more outreach to build regional support for the campaign, for outreach to new legislators who may be willing to push for safety and environmental studies, for more nonviolent direct action training sessions and for more days of action.</p>
<p>We hope to raise more than the initial $20,000, but we need at least that amount to have what it takes to get started. We hope you will donate and spread the word because we are ready to go.</p>
<p>We are a certified non-profit under the fiscal sponsorship of the Alliance for Global Justice, so your donation will be tax deductible. </p>
<p>We are offering unique rewards in this campaign. You will be able to get fossils from the Calvert Cliffs and scalloped shells from the region, a sample of Cove Point sand that you can wear as a necklace to connect you to the place, signed copies of our local artist Leslie Garcia's cartoons that are inspired by the export terminal and more.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The export terminal being built by Dominion in Cove Point places the local community at risk of a catastrophic event such as a chemical spill or explosion. Because these risks are real, no export terminal has ever been built in a residential area before now.</p>
<p>In March, there was an explosion at a liquefied natural gas plant in Plymouth, WA which sent flames hundreds of feet high.  People as far as 6 miles away felt the blast and a two-mile radius was evacuated. The cause of the explosion is still unknown.</p>
<p>Within a two-mile radius of Dominion's plant in Cove Point there are 2,365 homes including 19 in-home daycare centers. For 265 houses, the only road leading out of the peninsula heads toward the facility. And the only emergency access to the facility is a narrow 2 lane road.</p>
<p>The We Are Cove Point campaign is about more than saving the local community. If this export terminal is built, it will make fracking of the whole Marcellus Shale which lies beneath seven states more profitable. More fracking means more families and communities that are exposed to its hazards. In Pennsylvania where fracking is prevalent, farmers have lost their farms and families have been forced out of their homes because of fracking.</p>
<p>The chemicals used in fracking and the gases and radiation that are released in the process poison water, land and air. Fracking is correlated with numerous health impacts. And methane leaks have made water undrinkable, started spontaneous house fires and add to the climate crisis. Fracking also causes earthquakes.</p>
<p>This export terminal will drive construction of more pipelines and compressor stations from Massachusetts to North Carolina. This means more communities will be at risk of local pollution and catastrophic explosions. Communities up and down the East Coast are fighting this expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure.</p>
<p>Instead of expanding fossil fuel infrastructure, we need to be decreasing it and moving to healthier and more sustainable sources of energy. Stopping this first export terminal on the East coast will send a strong message that other terminals will be stopped too. </p>
<p>We can stop Dominion's terminal. Marylanders stopped one from being built at Sparrow's Point in 2013. New Yorkers just achieved a fracking ban statewide. The momentum is on our side. We can turn the tide towards a livable future.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Our greatest obstacle is time because construction of the terminal has already started. The community was kept in the dark until late last year. They have since been unsuccessful at stopping the project by appealing to legislators or through the courts. These efforts continue. There are cases in the works and there are new legislators who might take action.</p>
<p>At this point, no matter what, we need to build a strong grassroots base quickly and organize strategic direct action to slow the construction process. This will be necessary whether we win by finally studying the real public safety risks and health impacts, through revocation of Dominion's permits, through the courts or by physically placing our bodies in the way.</p>
<p>There is a real potential to create this activated grass roots. People in the community demonstrated great support during the days of action in November and early this month. More people are interested in getting involved both locally and from outside the community.</p>
<p>We are already holding regular conference calls and have created working groups to work on particular pieces of the campaign. We really need a full time organizer in the community who can help to coordinate the pieces and orchestrate the canvassing and events. We have several excellent prospects for an organizer. If people are particularly generous and we raise more funds, we will even hire two organizers and that will be a great help.</p>

More fracking means more families and communities that are exposed to its hazards. In Pennsylvania where fracking is prevalent, farmers have lost their farms and families have been forced out of their homes because of fracking.
The chemicals used in fracking and the gases and radiation that are released in the process poison water, land and air. Fracking is correlated with numerous health impacts. And methane leaks have made water undrinkable, started spontaneous house fires and add to the climate crisis. Fracking also causes earthquakes.
This export terminal will drive construction of more pipelines and compressor stations from Massachusetts to North Carolina. This means more communities will be at risk of local pollution and catastrophic explosions. Communities up and down the East Coast are fighting this expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure.
Instead of expanding fossil fuel infrastructure, we need to be decreasing it and moving to healthier and more sustainable sources of energy. Stopping this first export terminal on the East coast will send a strong message that other terminals will be stopped too. 
We can stop Dominion's terminal. Marylanders stopped one from being built at Sparrow's Point in 2013. New Yorkers just achieved a fracking ban statewide. The momentum is on our side. We can turn the tide towards a livable future.
    Risks & Challenges Our greatest obstacle is time because construction of the terminal has already started. The community was kept in the dark until late last year. They have since been unsuccessful at stopping the project by appealing to legislators or through the courts. These efforts continue. There are cases in the works and there are new legislators who might take action.
At this point, no matter what, we need to build a strong grassroots base quickly and organize strategic direct action to slow the construction process. This will be necessary whether we win by finally studying the real public safety risks and health impacts, through revocation of Dominion's permits, through the courts or by physically placing our bodies in the way.
There is a real potential to create this activated grass roots. People in the community demonstrated great support during the days of action in November and early this month. More people are interested in getting involved both locally and from outside the community.
We are already holding regular conference calls and have created working groups to work on particular pieces of the campaign. We really need a full time organizer in the community who can help to coordinate the pieces and orchestrate the canvassing and events. We have several excellent prospects for an organizer. If people are particularly generous and we raise more funds, we will even hire two organizers and that will be a great help.

<p>BOSSD promotes environmentally and socially sustainable development. We invite people to collaborate on an open source approach to plan, implement, and participate in a land-based learning and community outreach center and working farm on our 40-acre property in northwestern Belize, near the village of August Pine Ridge.<br/><br/>
We have a partnering relationship with <a href=""http://www.ewb-usa.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title=""ewb-usa"">Engineers Without Borders-USA (EWB-USA)</a>.

  We really could use your help and we have great promotions for donations.<br/><br/>

Because of our 501(c)(3) status, U. S. taxpayer donations to the project and appropriate supporting expenses to visit can be treated as tax-deductible donations. However, substantive benefits to the contributor can’t be treated as tax deductible. For example, the value of accommodations at Belize Open Source, nominally $25 U.S. per day for room only (meals are not included, but can be arranged for with local families), if used, would reduce the total tax-deductible amount. </p>

<p>Belize is small: About 175 miles, north-south, by 80 miles wide. It has
diverse land regions: cayes, beaches, tropical rain forests, mountain
pine ridge, and savannahs (where we are). Belize is small enough and transportation is good enough that a stop at
Belize Open Source can be included as part of your itinerary, along

the practical application of its principles. Nestled deep in the sub-tropical
forest of north-western Belize and renowned for being the largest private
reserve and second largest single protected area in the country, the Rio Bravo
Conservation and Management Area (RBCMA) is located only two and a half hours
away from Belize City (we're along the way). 










Edilberto Romero, Executive Director, Programme for Belize,
is from August Pine Ridge and has shared his advice with us as we have planned
BOSSD.





Lamanai, is one of the most visited Mayan archaeological sites of
Belize, situated on the New River
Lagoon. The site can be reached by bus from Orange Walk in about 2
hours (we're along the way). Boat trips from Orange Walk on the New River also take about 2
hours and are highly recommended.


In Orange Walk, don't miss Osmany Salas and his team's Nahil Mayab
Restaurant & Patio, 1st Place winner of 2010 Taste of Belize - Best
of Belize Category. Surrounded by lush tropical gardens, it's a
tropical oasis in the heart of Orange Walk Town (we're along the way). Osmany has also advised us and planned a Belize Open Source brainstorming  meeting in February 2008. A summary and  recommended next steps, from the discussion are posted online.

<p>Hello, my name is Emma, and I aspire to a career in wildlife conservation. As Vanderbilt’s Keegan Traveling Scholar, I will pursue my project on wildlife conservation in the world' biodiversity hotspots for the next 13 months. By interning with NGOs across the biodiversity hotspots—regions rich in species but also highly threatened by human activities—I will be<strong> </strong><strong>working with conservation projects where the extinction threat is most keenly felt. </strong></p>
<p>My trail begins in El Cerrado, and then traces its way through hotspots called the Tropical Andes, the Tumbes-Chocó Magdalena, New Zealand, the Western Ghats, Madagascar and the Indian Ocean Islands, Eastern Himalaya, and the Guinean Forests of West Africa. I shall be at most sites for a month to a month and a half. </p>
<p>The majority of <strong>my time will be invested in either a special project to help that NGO or in assisting with that NGO’s ongoing activities.</strong> For example, I will create signage for an endangered primate rehabilitation center in Ghana, create promotional videos for birding reserves across South American, field assist with snow leopards in Nepal, create a short documentary about the ties between biological and cultural diversity in Bolivia, monitor and perform habitat restoration for native species in New Zealand and on Cousin Island, and contribute to community outreach efforts with lemurs in Madagascar… </p>
<p>My principle intention is <strong>to learn what makes these programs successful; and to apply this knowledge to my future conservation efforts. </strong></p>
<p>All the while, I will be<strong> </strong><strong>bringing the faces and stories of the wild populations I encounter to light through my photography and blogged reflections</strong> [preview my blog here: <a href=""http://www.vanderbilt.edu/travelfellowship/blogs/steigerwald/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.vanderbilt.edu/travelfellowship/blogs/steigerwald/</a>]. This blog will highlight what I learn about what<strong> </strong><strong>changes we can make in our own lives to support the conservation of biodiversity both at home and abroad</strong>. </p>
<p>However, <strong>this ambitious itinerary will not be possible, without a boost from the IndiGogo community. </strong>My itinerary costs approximately $22,000, but the Keegan Fellowship provides me with $15,000.

<p><strong>Transition Community Initiative Philippines (TCIP), Inc.</strong> or <strong>“Kaya Natin Magbago Pag Sama-sama”</strong> is a social enterprise network dedicated to assist transition initiatives confronting food, financial, climate and energy crises, focusing on links between the social and natural environments, skills retooling, and people’s development in the context of sustainability and social justice. We are based in Quezon City, Metro Manila and work country wide.</p>
<p> TCIP is a movement to facilitate urban farming and permaculture practices in the Philippines.  We work to address the lack of fresh and organic produce, and inadequate resources and support for permaculture practices.  We research and develop best practices, design gardens and garden products, host gardening workshops and work in partnership with NGOs and individuals to set up urban gardens and farms across the Philippines. We are now working in five localities in Nueva Ecija Province, and in Dingalan town in Aurora Province. Our latest initiative, the subject of this Proposal, is an urban farming and social development project in partnership with a community housing association in the heart of Quezon City, Metro Manila.</p>

<p>THE CHALLENGE: </p>
<p>The Bagong Lipunan Pag-asa Condominium Community (BLPC Community) is a tight-knit community lying minutes away (by foot) from SM-Shopping Mall, Trinoma, and the Rapid Transit Station, in Metro-Manila.</p>
<p>We want to transform a minimum of 5,000 sqft of the unused land of the Bagong Lipunan Pag-asa condominium into an exemplar urban farm and community space.  The project is located in a middle income, mixed-use condominium complex in a very busy area of Quezon City, Metro-Manila.  There is no source for organic produce in this extremely dense urban area.  We hope that by showing it is possible to grow food in a densely urbanized area with limited resources we will inspire others to start growing (some of) their own food in the underutilized spaces that surround them.</p>
<p>The rationale for the project is based on the premise that environment and socio-economic issues are closely interlinked and that one can be tackled with the aid of the other. Urban Agriculture by itself is a very beneficial activity. It improves the quality of health and environment in the city by providing locally produced organic food which is otherwise transported from long distances using precious fossil fuels generating greenhouse gases and pollution. Urban agriculture also adds to the urban greenery, reduceing the paved surface of the city, and improving the visual and psychological conditions for residents.</p>
<p>Among the poorest and most exploited residents of the city are street children, who are normally looked upon by urban dwellers as vagabonds and trouble-makers, but in fact are highly talented. Having to fend for themselves and survive in a megacity, their creative instincts are better trained than children who are taken care of by the family. It is these latent creative abilities that need to be tapped in order to help them become productive, economically independent and free from exploitation in society.</p>
<p>We have connected with local NGOs working with street children in order to create workshops and urban gardening programs for them at the BLPC Community urban farms. This will allow them to gain training on urban farming and business management skills by growing and selling their own produce at the local farmers’ market.</p>
<p>The project would be a unique experiment in socio-economic and environmental management of resources in a community. In many ways, it is unprecedented and will form a model for cities all over the subcontinent.</p>

<p>The Urban Farm will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grow organic fruits, herbs and vegetables</li>
<li>Compost kitchen waste</li>
<li>Sell produce through the community grocery store/ create a community farmers market</li>
<li>Host workshops to educate and expose city dwellers to the possibilities of urban farming and train urban farmers</li>
<li>Host workshops for street children in order to provide farming and business skills training.</li>
<li>Research, design and develop best practices for urban farming</li>
<li>Serve as an outdoor community and activity space (such as yoga and dance classes) for building residents, street children and the neighborhood as a whole</li>
<li>Establish working arrangements between the land and building owners and their Association (BLPC), the street children as urban farm workers, managers, and food consumers, commercial marketing of the produce, and TCIP and the street children NGOs who will guide the project.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>THE QUESTIONS:  How much food can we grow on 5,000 sqft of urban land space?  How many people will this feed?  How many jobs will this create?  How financially feasible is it (in Manila) to convert urban space into community farms? What are the minimum and optimal areas for an urban farm project? What other actors (Local Governments, businesses, churches etc can be mobilized to support and provide access to land for extending urban farming in Metro-Manila? TCIP plans to develop a model that others can replicate and will share all information and findings on our website and publications.</p>
<p>FUNDING:</p>
<p>The $7,000 budgeted will be used to cover the costs of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Soil and potting mix</li>
<li>Seedlings and fruit trees</li>
<li>Growing containers</li>
<li>2 shade structures made from natural materials (materials and labor)</li>
<li>Vertical garden structure (materials and labor)</li>
<li>Tables and seating (refurbished second-hand pieces)</li>
<li>Composting Unit</li>
<li>Tool Shed (made of discarded building materials)</li>
<li>Basic gardening tools and drums for storage</li>
<li>Undertaking the design and management of the Project, and research.</li>

<p>WHY MANILA:  Metro- Manila is the largest and most densely populated city in the Philippines.  As the city grows in size and population, open spaces and farmable land disappear.  Access to quality, nutrient-rich and fresh food is an ever-growing problem for all residents, especially the city's poor.  Average food prices are rapidly increasing.  Produce travels about 5 days before it reaches markets and approximately 40% of produce is lost from farm to table.  Because of this, produce is often harvested before it is ripe to prevent spoiling, and harmful chemicals such as Ethylene and Ethephon are used to artificially ripen it.  Both these chemicals are known to cause neurological damage.</p>
<p>In the Philippines, urban children are more likely to be malnourished than children in rural areas.  This is due to a number of factors, one of which is the unavailability of fresh produce that contains proper nutritional content.</p>
<p>Growing food locally, in the large areas of useable space in urban Manila (waste land and unused plots, flat open rooftops and terraces) can begin to address the problem of lack of access, due to affordability and availability, of quality produce.  Additionally, transport time and costs are drastically reduced, and little to no energy resources or packaging is needed to store produce from the time it is harvested to sold.  Urban agriculture also holds the potential to raise awareness about organic food growing practices, healthy eating habits, and provides beautiful, green outdoor spaces for city dwellers to enjoy. </p>
<p>Finally, the large urban population of Metro-Manila (almost 12 million), and the increasing awareness of its population to proper nutrition and fresh, quality food, provides an enormous market in immediate proximity to the urban farm producers.</p>

When given the necessary tools, women use their income and resources to increase the well-being of their children and families, and they play a critical role in reducing food insecurity, poverty, and the socioeconomic effects of climate change.”  - Women’s Climate Change Resolution, introduced in the US Congress earlier this year",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

We have specialists in subsea engineering, oceanography, marine ecology and conservation, electrical engineering, fabrication, and design. We have the experience, technology, and expertise to make this vision a reality.<p></p>
<p>By bringing our project to Indiegogo and being funded by the wonderful people who are part of this community, we will be able to rapidly move the turbine project toward utility-scale power generation.</p>
<p>The first step following the successful Indiegogo campaign will be to move Crowd Energy’s operations to Florida Atlantic University (FAU).</p>
<p>Using the Southeast National Marine Renewable Energy Center (SNMREC) at FAU open water testing. Crowd Energy will begin final development of the large-scale turbine. As the turbines are installed they will  be the first underwater turbines to deliver clean and safe, renewable energy to the power grid.

Most people do not realize the Ocean is always moving. Giant flowing underwater currents that circle the globe. Crowd Energy has developed the technology to safely and efficiently capture these underwater currents and convert them into Utility Scale Electricity and Fresh Potable Water.
Join Crowd Energy and make a positive impact, become part of a team of people who will be remembered for changing the way the world uses energy.
Years from now you can look back and proudly say “ I helped make that happen!”
We need your help to turn the proven design into a small production scale turbine. 
With this production scale turbine we can do the required field testing to get approval for large production scale turbines.
You help will get Crowd Energy to the next step in the goal of becoming a 100% clean renewable Utility.
Donate Now and Let the world know that you stand for a smarter solution.






Crowd Energy is a renewable energy company with over 150 years combined experience in the ocean industry. After 8 years of research and development on the Ocean Energy Turbine, we need your help in raising funds to build large-scale systems for testing at the Florida Atlantic University. The benefits of this state-of-the-art, eco-friendly design present a viable solution in lowering the effects of climate change.

At Crowd Energy, we aim to lead innovation in clean and safe ocean energy around the globe. We are Crowd Energy because we are a crowd of energy enthusiasts focused on solving the Global Energy Crisis responsibly. Together all of us can be an example and ensure our world will be clean and sustainable for future generations.




HERE’S WHAT WE PLAN TO DO AFTER THE INDIEGOGO

We have specialists in subsea engineering, oceanography, marine ecology and conservation, electrical engineering, fabrication, and design. We have the experience, technology, and expertise to make this vision a reality.
By bringing our project to Indiegogo and being funded by the wonderful people who are part of this community, we will be able to rapidly move the turbine project toward utility-scale power generation.
The first step following the successful Indiegogo campaign will be to move Crowd Energy’s operations to Florida Atlantic University (FAU).
Using the Southeast National Marine Renewable Energy Center (SNMREC) at FAU open water testing. Crowd Energy will begin final development of the large-scale turbine. As the turbines are installed they will  be the first underwater turbines to deliver clean and safe, renewable energy to the power grid.



Crowd Energy will begin final development of the large-scale turbine using the Southeast National Marine Renewable Energy Center (SNMREC) at FAU’s open water testing facilities. 

Once the turbines are installed, they will be the first Utility Scale underwater turbines to deliver clean, safe, and renewable energy to the power grid.
The Southeast National Marine Renewable Energy Center (SNMREC) is in the process of securing the nation’s first offshore energy lease from the US Department of Interior.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Our coral reefs, worldwide, are being depleted by gross negligence and abuse by both people and industry alike.  Many times this negligence is not intentional but can be attributed to a lack of knowledge or simply corporate negligence in the name of progress. </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">We believe that neither of these is intentional however, the results are devastating.  In an attempt to correct this issue <strong>SeaRest, Inc.</strong> is undertaking a global challenge to help and promote the rebuilding of our reef structures that have fallen prey to this unintentional abuse.</p>

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>Morris Huggins</strong>, the founder of <strong>SeaRest, Inc.</strong>, is beginning this campaign to rebuild and restore our reef beds throughout the coastal waters of the United States.  We are anticipating such an overwhelming positive response that this will become a global campaign.  </p>

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><br/>The corporate business plan of <strong>SeaRest, Inc.</strong> is for this venture is to fund the ongoing campaign through the introduction of the “Innovative and Environmentally Beneficial Burial Alternative”.  This “Alternative” will also help eliminate our carbon footprint on this earth and at the same time reduce the overwhelming depletion and abuse of our natural resources in regards to the acreage of non-reusable land that we are consuming with traditional burial practices.</p>

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Each artificial reef module weighs in from between 5,000 to 16,000 pounds depending on the size and configuration needed.  These are made from reinforced structural concrete and limestone boulders that have been designed, engineered and approved to withstand the various currents and conditions present on the ocean floor. </p>

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Stability analysis has been completed by an independent testing facility to meet or exceed the requirements by the state of Florida.  Over the past 5 years, the modules that have been originally deployed have met and exceeded our expectations for stability, growth and the positive impact in regards to attracting marine life, coral growth and creating a safe haven for various crustaceans.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Our coral reefs, worldwide, are being depleted by gross negligence and abuse by both people and industry alike.  Many times this negligence is not intentional but can be attributed to a lack of knowledge or simply corporate negligence in the name of progress. 
We believe that neither of these is intentional however, the results are devastating.  In an attempt to correct this issue SeaRest, Inc. is undertaking a global challenge to help and promote the rebuilding of our reef structures that have fallen prey to this unintentional abuse.
   
Morris Huggins, the founder of SeaRest, Inc., is beginning this campaign to rebuild and restore our reef beds throughout the coastal waters of the United States.  We are anticipating such an overwhelming positive response that this will become a global campaign.  
 
 

The corporate business plan of SeaRest, Inc. is for this venture is to fund the ongoing campaign through the introduction of the “Innovative and Environmentally Beneficial Burial Alternative”.  This “Alternative” will also help eliminate our carbon footprint on this earth and at the same time reduce the overwhelming depletion and abuse of our natural resources in regards to the acreage of non-reusable land that we are consuming with traditional burial practices.
 
 
  The SeaRest Alternative :

        


Why we need funding:
The funding that we are seeking will be used for the initial construction and deployment of the first major reef project.  Additionally, some of the funding will be used for marketing and for the furthering of public awareness. 
Each artificial reef module weighs in from between 5,000 to 16,000 pounds depending on the size and configuration needed.  These are made from reinforced structural concrete and limestone boulders that have been designed, engineered and approved to withstand the various currents and conditions present on the ocean floor. 
    
Stability analysis has been completed by an independent testing facility to meet or exceed the requirements by the state of Florida.  Over the past 5 years, the modules that have been originally deployed have met and exceeded our expectations for stability, growth and the positive impact in regards to attracting marine life, coral growth and creating a safe haven for various crustaceans.
 
 
What you will get:
By viewing the sidebar to the right, you will see what various levels of funding will yield in perks.  As this is an environmental impact campaign, the most substantial perks will not be tangible.  Knowing that you have helped to further a program that is aimed at benefiting the planet and all mankind, this perk is the most important. 
However, the reciprocal perks that SeaRest is offering for these donations are varied in nature from support “thank you” gestures to actual internment spaces in the artificial reef modules themselves.  Featured Below are a few of the perks available.
   



How the funds will be used:
Wheter or not we reach the full requested funding amount, the proceeds will be used for the following:
      1.  Deployment:



Reef Site Permitting
Reef Module Construction
Ground Transportation
Deployment Barge and Crane Fees



      2.  Education & Awareness:

Reef Growth Documentation
Product Analysis & Ongoing Development
Future Deployment Site Analysis & Research
Additional Product Marketing and Environmental Awareness

 
Environmental Impact:

SeaRest,Inc. provides a beneficial twofold solution to the problem at hand. Our valuable land resources are preserved for future generations. Simultaneously, the fragile ecosystem of our coral reefs and it's inseparable symbiosis with all other life are improved.

Green Dubuque is an independent 501(c)3 non-profit organization formed in 2007 to provide opportunities for Dubuque-area residents to make their community healthier and more sustainable. From the very beginning, Green Dubuque has been guided by the principle ""think globally, act locally,"" and for the past four years, has worked to solve complex problems with practical, local solutions. 




The Plan


The GHG Reduction Plan was written to provide a realistic
path to achieving 50% GHG reduction by 2030 in Dubuque.  Other cities have published plans of
their own, but those plans tend to be long on ambition and short on
specifics.  The Dubuque GHG Plan
goes beyond vague vision statements to provide specific, concrete action steps
by which Dubuque can achieve its goal. 



 


The recommendations discussed in the plan are tailored to
Dubuque's specific needs and capabilities.  The costs, benefits, and GHG reductions are then calculated
for each action, which allows us to prioritize recommendations based on GHG
reductions achieved, effort required, and the side benefits each action brings
to Dubuque (notably, those “side benefits” often far outweigh the GHG
impact).  Every recommendation in
this plan is designed to benefit Dubuque's health, transportation, and economic
prosperity, reaching well beyond GHG reduction.


 


Most importantly, this plan is realistic.  Each of the recommendations in the plan
have been tested, proven, and refined in other communities—after all, if it
works, why reinvent the wheel? 
Each recommendation is also well within the power of local actors,
including city government, businesses, and individuals.  We do not have to wait for state and
national governments to break their political gridlock—we can solve our own
problems, our own way.
 
We think you'll be surprised how simple and attainable this
goal is.  In fact, thanks to the
efforts of Green Dubuque and others in the community, many of the
biggest-impact recommendations are already in the early stages of
implementation in Dubuque.  So
we're already well on our way.  The
goal is feasible.  The plan is
good.  We can do this.


What We Need & What You Get
Green Dubuque needs your help raising the necessary funds to push this unprecedented plan through. The funds will go directly to marketing and hosting speaking events to raise support and awareness. Green Dubuque is creating an easily accessible and thorough website specifically for informing the public of the GHG Reduction Plan, 50/2030. 

By Donating, you are not only contributing monetarily, but you are taking an active part in the process of reducing your carbon footprint. There are a lot of unique perks for supporting this initiative, but the biggest is becoming a part of the co2 reduction movement.

<p>The $150 billion global seafood industry faces serious supply uncertainties and is growing at 2.0 to 2.5%/year. Seafood growth should be significantly higher as it is the most efficient way of producing animal protein.  In recent years, costs have steadily increased and the lack of affordable, seafood is impacting demand. In addition, concern over quality and safety issues have further limited growth. TimberFish’s technology addresses key issues limiting demand.</p>
<p>TimberFish’s initial customers will be US retailers for sale at their fresh seafood counters. Sales will be aimed at health, quality and environmentally concerned buyers. Our total potential sales in this market to be about $850 million/year.</p>

<p>Longer-term, as supply shortfalls increase and public awareness demands more healthy seafood options, we believe quality and cost advantages will allow us to target the $15 billion more cost competitive frozen and canned segments. We are confident TimberFish will be competitive in this larger market.  Additionally, global sales are an even greater opportunity being about fifteen times the size of the total US market.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Short Science Section – How It Works…</strong></p>
<p>TimberFish mimics nature, creating an ecosystem that simultaneously grows feed and consumes solid and dissolved wastes. The process controls pathogens and organisms that give seafood unwanted taste. Our facilities will be built beside food processing facilities, breweries and wineries. We will use their nutrient-rich wastewater, combined with local wood chips to grow microbes, which are consumed by invertebrates and in turn consumed by our happy, healthy, marketable fish!  </p>
<p>The process is controlled to prevent contaminants from entering the system/seafood. Water is recirculated to minimize usage.  The only residuals from the system are spent wood which will be sold as biofuel and clean water.</p>
<p>At least three businesses, each supporting job growth and the local economy are directly supported by our venture.  Wood harvesting and chipping, TimberFish itself and local truckers, as well as reducing costs for our nutrient source.</p>

<p><strong>Our Business Plan - Where We Are Going</strong></p>
<p>With funds raised on Indiegogo, TimberFish will expand our development facility using it to create the design for commercial facilities, document the superiority of our seafood and develop a marketing plan. We anticipate having our first commercial facility operating in 2021. We are currently meeting with potential partners to work with us on this facility, starting with engineering design firms and potential retail partners. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How this Indiegogo Campaign will be used</strong></p>
<p>Our next step at TimberFish Technologies is to engage an engineering firm to produce designs/blueprints for replicable commercial facilities.  Secondly, we need to fully document the superiority of our seafood by sending it for independent laboratory analysis.  Engineering, design and lab testing are necessary, but costly activities.</p>
<p>Our business proposition is that TimberFish Technologies is an environmentally sound solution to economically produce seafood. We believe we have significant advantages versus competitors based:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating an ecosystem that simultaneously grows feed and consumes solid and dissolved wastes, while controlling pathogens and organisms that give seafood unwanted tastes</li>
<li>On using low cost inputs to grow our own feed while cleaning waste without additional costs. </li>
<li>Having three revenue streams from: producing natural, healthy seafood, cleaning wastewater from food processing facilities, such as wineries and breweries, and our only waste is a valuable biofuel</li>
</ul>
<p>Our approach to rapidly growing the business is to license the technology globally to local companies, preferably already in the seafood supply chain. This strategy allows local companies to use their operating expertise, financial strength and market knowledge to rapidly grow production providing healthy, environmentally sound seafood to the public. By having multiple licensees in different regions we can simultaneously grow in several areas making our vision a reality sooner.</p>
<p>We have compared the costs of producing seafood with our technology to published information about the operation and cost structure of seafood farms. Our research revealed that our costs will be at least 30% below competitors.  Analysis of our operating and construction costs indicate that commercial facilities using TimberFish’s process would be excellent investments. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>TimberFish has successfully grown salable fish from fingerlings during several years of field and validated these results in third party testing. The latter quantified health benefits as well as water quality. We are highly confident that we can reproduce these results at a larger scale in our demonstration facility and in subsequent commercial facilities.</p>
<p>We need to learn how to optimize the various interactions within larger systems and assure that the process runs efficiently and economically.  These are the tasks that we will use the funds we raise on Indiegogo to resolve using our demonstration facility.  Since our process is based on wastewater treatment we can rely on an existing large knowledge base and our own prior work experience to manage what is happening within the system.  Part of our team invented and lead the launch of Bion, a livestock waste management system company in the 1990s.  Bion is currently operating and listed on the OTC stock exchanges.  Other team members have extensive experiences in launching new business and new products globally.</p>
<p>In addition the farming of seafood is a large industry, and managing these facilities is well known and this knowledge can be applied to our system</p>
<p>We know that TimberFish’s technology works and we know how engineering designs for commercial facilities are generated.  The challenge is doing it economically, which will be the difference between this being a niche technology and being a disruptive change in how seafood is grown.</p>
<p><strong>THE REAL RISK IS NOT GIVING TIMBERFISH A CHANCE TO HELP SECURE THE FOOD SUPPLY AND PRO-ACTIVELY IMPROVE THE ENVIRONMENT</strong></p>

TimberFish (TFT) Produces Sustainable, Healthy Seafood
TimberFish is an ecology based technology that avoids issues that affect current seafood supply and quality. It creates an ecosystem that contains no contaminants, internally grows feed and cleans all waste. We are an emerging technology that can create a new, local, sustainable aquaculture industry that produces safe, contaminant-free seafood.
         

Fish at our current facility 
 
 TimberFish is a low cost means of supplying protein-rich seafood grown from plant materials such as wood chips and corn stalks and nutrient-rich waste water from food processors such as distilleries, breweries, and wineries. This waste water is rich in phosphorous, nitrogen and other minerals which are essential for growing seafood, but which when released untreated into the environment destroys the natural balance leading to algae blooms and dead zones. Our processes only outputs are seafood, clean water and spent wood chips which can be used as an enhanced biofuel or a soil supplement. There is no waste! 
     
Distillery at our site and a frog in our system
TimberFish launched was launched in 2008 and is supported by a strong team in partnership with several branches of the State University of New York and industry experts. Over the last two years we have been building momentum, winning $110,000 in New York State grants and raising an additional $150,000, which we used to build a demonstration facility at the site of the Five & 20 Spirits & Brewing facility in Westfield New York.  
 
              

TIMBERFISH'S WESTFIELD NY FACILITY
 
 Now, with your support, we will increase the capacity of this facility to more than 10,000 lbs/year of marketable seafood for consumer testing and develop the design for a large commercial facility. Our current facility provides us with the opportunity to take our technology to the next level – a 2 to 3 million lb/year commercial operation.  Funds raised on Indiegogo will be used to develop information needed to obtain financing for commercial facilities 
We’re bringing our technology to Indiegogo because we need your help to finish development and turn our vision into a new, safe global seafood supply. We need your help to make our mission of creating a healthy, non-polluting, contaminant-free affordable seafood supply for the local and global population a reality!

What Is TimberFish - Let’s Get Into the Details
TimberFish takes low value plant material combines it with nutrients from food processing facilities to grow feed for seafood
 Our only outputs are clean water and a biological residuals that are an enhanced biofuel
Assuring the food supply is one of the most critical issues facing humanity.  Seafood is capable of being a major part of the solution, but declining supply, rising costs, health concerns and pollution issues are limiting consumption.  Wild caught seafood supply has been declining for thirty years. Seafood farms in oceans and rivers are striving to meet supply shortfalls, but they:

Are generally located far from major markets, create local pollution, are vulnerable to disease and natural hazards, while their costs are increasing
Require marine feeds that introduce additional contaminants into the farmed seafood

A potential solution is to develop recirculating land-based systems to meet future supply shortfalls, but current technologies are not able to overcome these critical shortcomings. As they:

Require the use of feeds from agricultural crops and marine proteins that introduce contaminants (e.g. mercury. Lead, PCBs and insecticides), which are increasingly seen as serious health problems
Produce seafood with inferior taste, texture, color and nutritional value
Require costly waste treatment to clean waste water which is high in nitrogen and phosphorus, as well as contaminants introduced in the feed
Are not economical - there have been several costly failures in the US


 
Conventional RAS treats growing seafood as a chemical process TimberFish represents a step change from existing land-based systems, by offering sustainable cost advantages over competitors based on our integrated, biological technology.
Eliminates the quality and health issues described above
Reuses nutrients in “wastewater” from food processors, such as breweries, distilleries and wineries to grow seafood, while cleaning wastewater, reducing the food processors’ cost and protecting the environment
Combining these nutrients with non-human food based inputs such as wood chips in the system as the only other input
Reducing greenhouse gases by bringing production closer to markets; reducing fuel usage, promoting carbon sequestering, encouraging reforestation and creating a byproduct biofuel

TimberFish‘s advantages include: 

Internally growing contaminant-free, natural, healthy feed that produces healthy seafood
Using our spent wood chips to generate heat or electricity partially offsetting energy costs
Producing clean output water without added equipment or operating cost
Reducing the length of the supply chain – On average US seafood is shipped an average of 5,500 miles to markets
Requiring minimal water intake
Lowering construction costs


In a recent article about our facility NPR wrote – “Conventional aquaculture systems rely heavily on wild fish, like anchovies and herring that are fed to the captive fish, often in the form of fish meal or pellets. This system is fundamentally wasteful, because it can take large amounts of feed — often made from fish that people could be eating directly — to produce a small amount of marketable fish.

Our business proposition is that TimberFish Technologies is an environmentally sound solution to economically produce seafood. We believe we have significant advantages versus competitors based:

Creating an ecosystem that simultaneously grows feed and consumes solid and dissolved wastes, while controlling pathogens and organisms that give seafood unwanted tastes
On using low cost inputs to grow our own feed while cleaning waste without additional costs. 
Having three revenue streams from: producing natural, healthy seafood, cleaning wastewater from food processing facilities, such as wineries and breweries, and our only waste is a valuable biofuel

Our approach to rapidly growing the business is to license the technology globally to local companies, preferably already in the seafood supply chain. This strategy allows local companies to use their operating expertise, financial strength and market knowledge to rapidly grow production providing healthy, environmentally sound seafood to the public. By having multiple licensees in different regions we can simultaneously grow in several areas making our vision a reality sooner.
We have compared the costs of producing seafood with our technology to published information about the operation and cost structure of seafood farms. Our research revealed that our costs will be at least 30% below competitors.  Analysis of our operating and construction costs indicate that commercial facilities using TimberFish’s process would be excellent investments. 
 
Risks & Challenges
TimberFish has successfully grown salable fish from fingerlings during several years of field and validated these results in third party testing. The latter quantified health benefits as well as water quality. We are highly confident that we can reproduce these results at a larger scale in our demonstration facility and in subsequent commercial facilities.
We need to learn how to optimize the various interactions within larger systems and assure that the process runs efficiently and economically.  These are the tasks that we will use the funds we raise on Indiegogo to resolve using our demonstration facility.  Since our process is based on wastewater treatment we can rely on an existing large knowledge base and our own prior work experience to manage what is happening within the system.  Part of our team invented and lead the launch of Bion, a livestock waste management system company in the 1990s.  Bion is currently operating and listed on the OTC stock exchanges.  Other team members have extensive experiences in launching new business and new products globally.
In addition the farming of seafood is a large industry, and managing these facilities is well known and this knowledge can be applied to our system
We know that TimberFish’s technology works and we know how engineering designs for commercial facilities are generated.  The challenge is doing it economically, which will be the difference between this being a niche technology and being a disruptive change in how seafood is grown.
THE REAL RISK IS NOT GIVING TIMBERFISH A CHANCE TO HELP SECURE THE FOOD SUPPLY AND PRO-ACTIVELY IMPROVE THE ENVIRONMENT",24.0,0,"1 Campaign

Scientific data collection and analysis are crucial to produce a survey having juridical validity and therefore be able to bar<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">gain with GoldCorp a new agreement to protects the people and the environment of Carrizalillo. People have a very limited bargaining power toward the big extractive company. This happens for different reasons. Scientific analysis of soil and water is expensive and the population does not have economic means to afford the costs of laboratory. Additionally it is very difficult to make un-biased analysis in Mexico where big extractive companies are so powerful to impose their interests on laboratories and technicians as well. The very state defends the interests of extractive companies failing to respresent those of the communities living in the areas of extraction. Also, the literacy rate is low and the majority of people have scarce legal knowledge to stand for their rights.   </span></p><p><b>In 2013,</b> dopo una consultazione popolare, la popolazione di Carrizalillo ha chiesto aiuto a Source International per riuscire a dimostrare giuridicamente i danni causati dalla miniera e per riuscire a rinegoziare con l'impresa estrattiva un nuovo contratto sociale che protegga le loro famiglie e l'ambiente. Infatti le popolazioni locali ed indigene hanno un potere di contrattazione molto limitato con le grandi imprese e questo accade per varie ragioni. La popolazione non ha le risorse economiche che pagare analisi chimiche delle acque e del suolo che sono molto costose e raccogliere quindi dati scientifici su inquinamento e danni ambientali ed alla salute. Inoltre è difficile trovare in Messico laboratori fidati in cui condurre le analisi perché questi spesso difendono gli interessi delle potenti imprese di estrazione. L' analfabetismo è alto e non sempre i rappresentanti della comunità hanno le conoscenze per far valere i propri diritti. C'è poca rappresentanza politica e scarso interesse nei loro confronti in quanto lo stato appoggia i grandi investimenti fatti dalle imprese minerarie.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>How we can help - Come possiamo aiutare</h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><ul>
<li>
<b>Making</b> water and soil analysis (therefore providing evidences having legal validity)  to scientifically prove the pollution of the area and the responsibility of GoldCorp</li>
<li>Supporting the advocacy efforts of the local activists both at the national  and international level</li>
<li>Supporting, if necessary, a judicial campaign against the state and/or the company for violation of human rights</li>
<li>Creating a first juridical case that will be a model case aiming to create a more participatory legislation for the defense of health and environment which is crucial to enhance the current national law. Many other mexican communities that are facing the same problems of Carrizalillo will benefit from from this campaign!</li>

<li>
<b>Facendo </b>analisi delle acque e dei sedimenti per provare scientificamente (quindi con validità giuridica) l'inquinamento dell'area e usando questi dati per dimostrare le responsabilità di GoldCorp</li>
<li>Supportando le campagne di advocacy degli attivisti locali a livello nazionale ed internazionale</li>
<li>Supportando, se necessario, un'azione legale contro lo stato e/o l'impresa per violazione dei diritti umani </li>
<li>Creando un caso nazionale ripetibile per ottenere una legislazione più partecipativa e rispettosa dell'ambiente e della salute.

Scientific data collection and analysis are crucial to produce a survey having juridical validity and therefore be able to bargain with GoldCorp a new agreement to protects the people and the environment of Carrizalillo. People have a very limited bargaining power toward the big extractive company. This happens for different reasons. Scientific analysis of soil and water is expensive and the population does not have economic means to afford the costs of laboratory. Additionally it is very difficult to make un-biased analysis in Mexico where big extractive companies are so powerful to impose their interests on laboratories and technicians as well. The very state defends the interests of extractive companies failing to respresent those of the communities living in the areas of extraction. Also, the literacy rate is low and the majority of people have scarce legal knowledge to stand for their rights.   In 2013, dopo una consultazione popolare, la popolazione di Carrizalillo ha chiesto aiuto a Source International per riuscire a dimostrare giuridicamente i danni causati dalla miniera e per riuscire a rinegoziare con l'impresa estrattiva un nuovo contratto sociale che protegga le loro famiglie e l'ambiente. Infatti le popolazioni locali ed indigene hanno un potere di contrattazione molto limitato con le grandi imprese e questo accade per varie ragioni. La popolazione non ha le risorse economiche che pagare analisi chimiche delle acque e del suolo che sono molto costose e raccogliere quindi dati scientifici su inquinamento e danni ambientali ed alla salute. Inoltre è difficile trovare in Messico laboratori fidati in cui condurre le analisi perché questi spesso difendono gli interessi delle potenti imprese di estrazione. L' analfabetismo è alto e non sempre i rappresentanti della comunità hanno le conoscenze per far valere i propri diritti. C'è poca rappresentanza politica e scarso interesse nei loro confronti in quanto lo stato appoggia i grandi investimenti fatti dalle imprese minerarie.How we can help - Come possiamo aiutare

Making water and soil analysis (therefore providing evidences having legal validity)  to scientifically prove the pollution of the area and the responsibility of GoldCorp
Supporting the advocacy efforts of the local activists both at the national  and international level
Supporting, if necessary, a judicial campaign against the state and/or the company for violation of human rights
Creating a first juridical case that will be a model case aiming to create a more participatory legislation for the defense of health and environment which is crucial to enhance the current national law. Many other mexican communities that are facing the same problems of Carrizalillo will benefit from from this campaign!


Facendo analisi delle acque e dei sedimenti per provare scientificamente (quindi con validità giuridica) l'inquinamento dell'area e usando questi dati per dimostrare le responsabilità di GoldCorp
Supportando le campagne di advocacy degli attivisti locali a livello nazionale ed internazionale
Supportando, se necessario, un'azione legale contro lo stato e/o l'impresa per violazione dei diritti umani 
Creando un caso nazionale ripetibile per ottenere una legislazione più partecipativa e rispettosa dell'ambiente e della salute. Questo pone le basi per una legislazione migliore che andrà a beneficiare tutto il territorio Messicano ed altre comunità che vivono gli stessi problemi di Carrizalillo!
How we will use the funds - Uso dei fondiSource International already collected 3000 Euro to pay two experts who will be responsible for the job to be done in Mexico (samples collection, research and analysis coordination, capacity buindings of local staff, identification and development of advocacy strategies).We now need 7000 Euros to help the community of Carrizalillo to negotiate on equal terms with the extractive company... thanks to this support the community can gain huge compensations! The joint action of Source International and the peole of Carrizalillo will pressure for GoldCorp to take responsability for the damages already caused to people's health and environment. It will pressure GoldCorp to modify its current practices of extraction applying international standards that are more respectful of environment and public health. Most importantly, a successful negotiation would be an extremly important achievement for the entire Mexico: it would be a legal precedent that would set the basis for an extraction of minerals that respect human rights and the environment!How the funds will be used:
3000 Euro for the scientific analysis of soil, sediments and water
3000 Euro to support the advocacy efforts of local activists
1000 Euro to support travel expenses  (Italy - Mexico) for an expert who will work with the community for at least one month

The 1st of March 2014 will mark the beginning of a long and important negotiation with GoldCorp... Help the people of Carrizalillo to be ready for it!
Source International ha già raccolto 3000 Euro per pagare il lavoro di due esperti che siano responsabili del lavoro da fare in Messico (raccolta dei campioni, coordinamento ricerca ed analisi, formazione del personale locale, identificazione e sviluppo della campagna di advocacy).Ci mancano ora 7000 Euro per riuscire ad aiutare la comunità a negoziare ad armi pari con l'impresa estrattiva... grazie a questo aiuto la comunità può ricevere milioni in indennizzi! L'azione di Source International e della gente di Carrizalillo spingerà perché sia riconosciuta la responsabilità di GoldCorp per quanto riguarda i danni all'ambiente e alla salute e perché GoldCorp modifichi le attuali pratiche estrattive aderendo agli standard internazionali che hanno un minore impatto sull'ambiente e sulla salute delle popolazioni locali. Ancor più importante: una negoziazione favorevole sarà un precedente importante per regolamentare l'estrazione mineraria in tutto il Messico in modo da renderla più rispettosa dell'uomo, dei suoi diritti e dell'ambiente!Come saranno usati i fondi raccolti:
3000 Euro per le analisi scientifiche di suolo, sedimenti ed acqua
3000 Euro per le spese di advocacy per supportare le campagne degli attivisti locali
1000 Euro per le spese di viaggio Italia - Messico per un esperto che opererà con la comunità per almeno un mese
Il primo Marzo 2014 inizierà una lunga ed importante negoziazione con GoldCorp... Aiuta la popolazione di Carrizalillo ad essere pronta!In case we raise more than what we expect (!!!) we will used the exceding funds to help other mexican communities that are struggling for similar reasons in Oaxaca, Chiapas and Puebla.In caso il vostro aiuto addirittura superi le nostre aspettative (!!!) useremo i fondi raccolti in più per aiutare altre comunità messicane che stanno lottando per motivi simili in Oaxaca, Chiapas e Puebla.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

thousands of cats going missing everyday and with a very small number of them
being recovered, losing your cat can be a devastating experience. A cat is more
than just a pet; to many of us a cat is a friend and a member of the family -
someone we truly love and care about.<br/>

If you are tired of existing tracking products being marketed to you as
cat friendly, even though they were originally designed for dogs, keys or even

<p></p>
<p>Over the past few years the <span>petTracer
team has spent a considerable amount of time analyzing cats and their
behaviour, natural habitats and needs.</span></p>
<p>At the same time we have done extensive research and
pioneer work in the field of energy<span>-efficient
technology for ""micro GPS-tracking"".
Thanks to this we have managed to successfully develop a fully functional,
ultra-light and highly accurate precision high-tech GPS-cat collar.</span></p>
<p>The collar was fully engineered and designed in
Switzerland. Furthermore, the technology will be patented shortly (pending).</p><span style=""color: #0070C0;""></span><h4>

</p><p>In addition to extensive battery life, a small weight
is the biggest challenge in manufacturing a GPS-cat collar. From the beginning
it was our ambitious goal to develop a cat collar that weighs less than 25
grams. Any collar weighing more than 25 grams is not suitable for cats to wear
comfortably and you should stay away from it, no matter how tempting it may be.</p>

<span style=""color: #0070C0;"">How the </span> pet<span style=""color: #0070C0;"">Tracer system works</span>
</h4>
<p></p>
<p>The GPS signal is received by the <span>petTracer GPS-cat collar that your cat wears. The
GPS coordinates are then transmitted to the petTracer HomeStation (receiver).
The coordinates are forwarded through the internet connection to the petTracer
server. The server is then accessed via Smartphone, computer or tablet to
locate your cat.</span></p>
<p>Tracks of your cats are recorded constantly. This
ensures that you will find your cat even in areas without reception.</p>
<p>
</p><h4><span style=""color: #0070C0;"">Harmful Mobile Phone Emission</span></h4>
<p>
</p><p>There is a big debate on the question whether mobile
phone emission poses any health risks. Since your cat is very dear to you, we
did not want to take any risks. For this reason we have pursued a solution
which is free of any mobile phone radiation and have therefore left this
particular discussion to others.</p>

<h3><span style=""color: #0070C0;""><b>Risks and Challenges</b></span></h3>
<p></p>
<p>During the last years of development
we have been facing many challenges. With the completion of the functional
prototype and miniaturization of electronic components, the greatest risks have
been eliminated. But of course, like any innovative project, there are
additional risks and challenges.</p>
<p>Challenges arise in completion
of the software and smartphone apps. As we work together with very experienced
programmers and web-designers we are confident to have these risks under
control. </p>
<p>We have already started to
line up the supply chain for mass production. We are working together with
experts to assemble the electronic components and manufacturing the GPS-cat collar.
At this point all the electronic components are available on the market, but
terms of delivery and availability vary. As soon as we reach our goal we will
order all the electronic components to make sure we have them ready in time for
production. Both our manufacturers are able to adapt production to our needs.</p>
<p>We are testing the petTracer
GPS-cat collar according to CE and FCC guidelines to meet international
standards. According to our supplier we should not experience any problems for
passing these tests. But there is still the risk of not passing these tests the
first time round. If we have to re-test, it could have an impact on the
delivery date.</p>
<p>Extensive user tests are
planned for January and February 2015. Even though we have tried to take
everything into consideration as well as possible, there still is the
possibility of having overlooked
something. Depending on the nature of any potential issues, we might need more
time than expected to solve them.</p>

</h3><h3><span style=""color: #0070C0;""><b>FAQ</b></span></h3>
<b></b>
<b></b>
<h4><span style=""color: #0070C0;"">How long does the battery last?</span></h4>
<p>PetTracer is a real life
tracking system that constantly tracks your cat. However, we managed to build a
collar which comes with a<b> battery life of several weeks</b>. This was only
possible due to our patented, safe trace-technique developed in the early phase
of the project. The collar guarantees the highest possible comfort for your cat
and with a much longer battery life compared to other products on the marked
(battery life of 1 to max. 7 days and an average weight of about 50g). </p>
<h4>
<span style=""color: #0070C0;"">How big is the </span> pet<span style=""color: #0070C0;"">Tracer GPS-Cat collar?</span>
</h4>
<p>The collar is just a tiny
bit bigger than any regular collar. Dimensions are: 14mm wide, 200mm - 280mm
long and between 2 - 7mm high (the 7mm height are the battery and GPS receiver
only). </p>
<h4>
<span style=""color: #0070C0;"">What is the range of the
</span> pet<span style=""color: #0070C0;"">Tracer GPS-Cat collar?</span>
</h4>
<p></p>
<p>The system consists of a
collar and receiver and works with a radio-signal. It can send and receive
signals up to a distance of 1.5 km (1.43 mi), thus the system covers an area of
up to 7km<sup>2</sup> (2.7 mi<sup>2</sup>). The quality and distance depends on
the type of area. <b>Additional
HomeStations can be used to increase the coverage area</b>. This is
automatically the case, if cat owners using a petTracer system are living
nearby. The result is an extended network of HomeStations (mesh network), which
can be used by all collars. But of course only you can see your own cats.</p>
<p>However, in a ground-breaking
experiment done by the BBC 2 Horizon in collaboration with the Royal Veterinary
Collage and with 50 cats from a village in Surrey UK, it was discovered that a
distance of around 200 m, in combination with a safety zone, is sufficient for
most domestic cats.</p>

<p>At this point we do not
know if mobile phone emission really is harmful to us or not. As human beings
it is our own choice to own a mobile phone. Your cat doesn't have this freedom
should you decide to fasten a collar around its neck. Your cat's health is the
most important aspect, so we are not taking any risk and decided to follow a solution
which is <b>free of</b> mobile phone
networks. Our solution has a radiation level that is 100 times below that of
standard mobile phone network dependable devices. Don't risk the health of your
cat by buying harmful devices - after all it will wear the collar every day,
day and night.</p>

<h3>pet<span style=""color: #0070C0;"">Tracer - Das erste
ultraleichte GPS Katzenhalsband, welches bedenkenlos für Katzen eingesetzt
werden kann!</span>
</h3>
<p>Tausende von Katzen
werden täglich vermisst! Nicht selten bleiben sie über Tage oder Wochen
verschwunden. In vielen Fällen bleiben sie leider für immer unauffindbar
und kehren nie mehr zu ihren Haltern zurück. Da sie uns ans Herz gewachsen sind
und einen zentralen Platz in unserer
Familie einnehmen, kann ein Katzenverlust ausserordentlich emotional und
schmerzhaft sein!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Wenn Sie genug haben von Produkten, die aktuell für das Lokalisieren von
Katzen angeboten werden, obwohl sie für Hunde, Schlüssel oder sogar Fahrzeuge
entwickelt wurden, dann gibt es gute Nachrichten.</p><p>Wir haben petTracer
entwickelt – das erste ultraleichte GPS Katzenhalsband, welches bedenkenlos für
Katzen eingesetzt werden kann! </p>

<p>Das ultraleichte petTracer GPS Katzenhalsband ist etwas Einzigartiges und
die Technologie wurde genau auf die Bedürfnisse der Katzen und ihre Halter entwickelt.
Es hat deshalb in der Schweiz bereits grosse mediale Aufmerksamkeit erhalten.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1014090/files/20141114044024-petTracer_Zeitungsartikel.JPG?1415968824"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<span style=""color: #0070C0;"">Das</span> pet<span style=""color: #0070C0;"">Tracer GPS Katzenhalsband im Detail</span>
</h4>

Das petTracer Team befasst sich seit einigen
Jahren intensiv mit Katzen, deren Verhalten, Lebensräumen und Bedürfnissen.
Langjährige und intensive Forschungs- und Pionierarbeit im Bereich
Stromsparverfahren für ""Mikro GPS Anwendungen"" wurde geleistet. Nur
dank diesem fundierten Knowhow ist es gelungen, ein funktionierendes, ultraleichtes
und präzises Hightech-GPS-Katzenhalsband nach Schweizer Qualitätsmassstäben zu
entwickeln und zu patentieren (angemeldet).<p></p>

<br/>
<h4><span style=""color: #0070C0;"">...und mit rund 20 Gramm ist es ultraleicht!</span></h4>
<p>Nebst der
Batterielebensdauer ist das geringe Gewicht die grösste Herausforderung, um ein
GPS Katzenhalsband herzustellen. Es war daher von Anfang an unser ehrgeiziges
Ziel, ein Halsband zu entwickeln, welches weniger als 25 Gramm wiegt. Jedes
Halsband, welches mehr als 25 Gramm wiegt ist für eine Katze unzumutbar.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1009348/files/20141112133805-petTracer_Batterie.jpg?1415828285"" src="""" style=""width: 300.268px; height: 236px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1009351/files/20141112133827-petTracer_Gewicht.jpg?1415828307"" src="""" style=""width: 302.281px; height: 236px;""/></p>

<span style=""color: #0070C0;"">Das</span> pet<span style=""color: #0070C0;"">Tracer GPS Katzenhalsband hat eine
beachtlich lange Akkulaufzeit von bis zu 4 Wochen! </span>
</h4>
<p>
</p>
<p>Das scheinbar nahezu unlösbare Problem stellte die Energieversorgung des GPS
Katzenhalsbandes dar. Eine lange Betriebszeit bedeutet einen hohen
Energieverbrauch. Demzufolge wird eine entsprechend grosse Batterie benötigt,
was zwangsläufig zu erhöhtem Gewicht und unhandlicher Grösse des GPS
Katzenhalsbandes führt. Dank unserem international patentierten Stromsparverfahren für Mikro
GPS Anwendungen haben wir dieses Problem gelöst.</p>

</h4><h4><span style=""color: #0070C0;"">Die Sicherheit Ihrer Katze kommt an erster Stelle!</span></h4>
<p>Dank dem Ein-Klick-Sicherheitsverschluss wird das Strangulieren Ihrer Katze verhindert. Er öffnet sich unverzüglich, falls sich Ihre Katze verfängt. Mit der Verwendung eines im Markt erprobten Sicherheitsverschlusses setzt petTracer auf Bewährtes und geht keine unnötigen Risiken in Bezug auf die Sicherheit von Katzen ein.</p>

<h3><span style=""color: #0070C0;"">Risiken &amp; Herausforderungen</span></h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Während den vergangenen Jahren der Entwicklungsarbeiten haben wir sehr viele
Herausforderungen gemeistert. Mit der Fertigstellung des funktionalen Prototyps und
der Miniaturisierung der Hardware auf Originalgrösse, haben wir die grössten
Risiken eliminiert. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Die Software für Smartphone Apps muss fertiggestellt werden und hier könnten
zusätzliche Probleme auftauchen. Wir arbeiten jedoch mit sehr kompetenten
Software-Entwicklern mit jahrelanger Erfahrung zusammen und sind sehr
zuversichtlich, dass wir diese Risiken weitgehend unter Kontrolle haben.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Wir haben damit begonnen, die ersten Schritte für die Serienproduktion
einzuleiten. Hierfür arbeiten wir mit mehreren Produktionsexperten zusammen, dessen
Kerngebiete das Assemblieren elektronischer Komponenten und die Verarbeitung
des Halsbandes sind. Zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt sind alle Komponenten im Markt
verfügbar. Die Konditionen bezüglich Verfügbarkeit können sich jedoch ändern
und wir haben keinen Einfluss darauf. Sobald wir unser Kampagnenziel erreichen,
werden wir möglichst alle zeitkritischen Komponenten einkaufen. Unsere
Lieferanten sind in der Lage, ihre Kapazitäten für unsere Bedürfnisse auszuweiten.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Wir werden das petTracer GPS Katzenhalsband CE und FCC zertifizieren lassen, um
nationale und internationale Standards einzuhalten. Obwohl wir hier nicht mit
Problemen rechnen, kann es trotzdem vorkommen, dass wir den FCC-Test nicht beim
ersten Mal bestehen. Dies hätte zur Folge, dass wir einen zweiten Test machen
müssen, was sich auf den Auslieferungstermin auswirken könnte.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ein umfangreicher Benutzertest ist zwischen Januar und Februar 2015 vorgesehen.
Wir haben diesen bereits sorgfältig geplant. Aber es gibt immer etwas Unvorhergesehenes
und wir wissen zu diesem Zeitpunkt nicht, ob wir genügend Zeitreserven
eingeplant haben.</p>

</h3><h3><span style=""color: #0070C0;""><b>Häufig gestellte Fragen</b></span></h3>
<h4>
<span style=""color: #0070C0;"">Wie leicht ist das</span> pet<span style=""color: #0070C0;"">Tracer GPS Katzenhalsband? </span>
</h4>
<p>Das Halsband wiegt weniger als 25g. Bei petTracer ist alles
im Halsband integriert. PetTracer ist kein Gerät, welches zusätzlich an
ein bestehendes Halsband angebracht werden muss. Es kommt also kein weiteres
Gewicht dazu! </p>
<h4><span style=""color: #0070C0;""><b>Wie lange hält der Akku? </b></span></h4>
<p>
</p>
<p>Das PetTracer Katzenhalsband zeichnet die gesamten zurückgelegten Strecken
Ihrer Katze konstant auf. Und trotzdem haben wir es geschafft, die Laufzeit des
Akkus auf <b>mehrere Wochen</b> zu erhöhen. Dies konnten wir nur dank unserer
aufwändig entwickelten und patentierten SafeTrace Technologie realisieren. Das
PetTracer GPS Katzenhalsband bietet eine erhebliche Erhöhung des Tragekomforts für
die Katze bei längerer Energieversorgung im Vergleich zu andern Produkten (Laufzeiten
von 1 bis maximal 7 Tagen und Gewichten ab ca. 50 Gramm).</p>
<h4>
<span style=""color: #0070C0;"">Hat das</span> pet<span style=""color: #0070C0;"">Tracer
GPS Katzenhalsband einen Sicherheitsverschluss? </span>
</h4>
<p>Ja! Das petTracer Katzenhalsband ist mit einem
handelsüblichen Sicherheitsverschluss ausgestattet. Dieser öffnet sich sofort,
sobald Ihre Katze in Gefahr ist. Mit der Verwendung eines erprobten
Sicherheitsverschlusses setzt petTracer auf Bewährtes und geht keine unnötigen
Risiken in Bezug auf die Sicherheit von Katzen ein.</p>
<h4>
<span style=""color: #0070C0;"">Wie gross ist das</span> pet<span style=""color: #0070C0;"">Tracer GPS Katzenhalsband? </span>
</h4>
<p>Es ist lediglich ein wenig grösser als ein herkömmliches
Katzenhalsband. Abmessungen: 14mm breit, 20-28cm lang und zwischen 4 und 7mm
dünn (7mm lediglich beim Akku und der GPS-Antenne). </p>
<h4>
<span style=""color: #0070C0;"">Wozu brauche ich den Universalring am</span> pet<span style=""color: #0070C0;"">Tracer GPS Katzenhalsband?</span>
</h4>
<p>
</p>
<p>Der Universalring ermöglicht Ihnen das Anbringen einer kleine Glocke oder einem
Türöffner für Ihre Katzentüre. Sie können somit alles Mögliche am petTracer
Halsband Ihrer Katze befestigen und benötigen kein separates Halsband mehr. Falls
Sie nichts Zusätzliches befestigen möchten, können Sie den Ring einfach
entfernen! </p>
<h4>
<span style=""color: #0070C0;"">Wie gross ist die
Reichweite des</span> pet<span style=""color: #0070C0;"">Tracer GPS Katzenhalsbands? </span>
</h4>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Das System setzt sich aus einem Halsband und einem Empfänger (HomeStaion) zusammen
und kommuniziert über eine strahlungsarme Funkverbindung. Es kann unter
günstigen Bedingungen bis zu 7km<sup>2</sup> abdecken. Die <b>Reichweite</b> ist abhängig von der Umgebung und kann, falls notwendig, durch Einsatz <b>von zusätzlichen Empfängern (HomeStationen) erhöht werden</b>. Dies ist
automatisch der Fall, wenn andere Katzenfreunde in ihrer Nähe auch petTracer
GPS Katzenhalsbänder im Einsatz haben. Diese bilden dann ein erweitertes Netz,
das allen nützt. Trotzdem sehen nur Sie Ihre Katzen.<br/></p>
<p>In einer gross angelegten Studie von „BBC two Horizon“ in Zusammenarbeit mit
dem Royal Veterinary Collage mit 50 Katzen in der Stadt Surrey (GB) wurden
viele interessante Details über das Verhalten von Katzen untersucht. Es stellte
sich heraus, dass eine Distanz von 200m in Kombination mit einer
Sicherheitszone in den meisten Fällen ausreichend ist. </p>

thousands of cats going missing everyday and with a very small number of them
being recovered, losing your cat can be a devastating experience. A cat is more
than just a pet; to many of us a cat is a friend and a member of the family -
someone we truly love and care about.

If you are tired of existing tracking products being marketed to you as
cat friendly, even though they were originally designed for dogs, keys or even
cars, then we have good news for you! We have developed petTracer - the first ultra-light GPS-cat collar
that actually works!


We have designed the collar especially for cats - and cats only!

With its unique design, small size and incredible
light weight, the petTracer GPS-cat collar
seems just like any regular collar. We made sure that the collar is as
comfortable as possible for a cat to wear.
Press / Media Coverage


Since petTracer is
the first of its kind and the technology has been designed specifically for it,
we have already received a lot of media attention in Switzerland.


The petTracer GPS-cat collar in detail


Over the past few years the petTracer
team has spent a considerable amount of time analyzing cats and their
behaviour, natural habitats and needs.
At the same time we have done extensive research and
pioneer work in the field of energy-efficient
technology for ""micro GPS-tracking"".
Thanks to this we have managed to successfully develop a fully functional,
ultra-light and highly accurate precision high-tech GPS-cat collar.
The collar was fully engineered and designed in
Switzerland. Furthermore, the technology will be patented shortly (pending).


The petTracer GPS-cat collar is extremely small and slim....

...
looks like any regular cat collar....


... and is super
light, weighing just over 20g!
In addition to extensive battery life, a small weight
is the biggest challenge in manufacturing a GPS-cat collar. From the beginning
it was our ambitious goal to develop a cat collar that weighs less than 25
grams. Any collar weighing more than 25 grams is not suitable for cats to wear
comfortably and you should stay away from it, no matter how tempting it may be.






The petTracer collar has an unmatched battery
life of up to 4 weeks!

The energy supply of a GPS-cat collar is a seemingly
irresolvable problem. Long operational periods result in high energy usage.
Therefore, a big battery is needed which inevitably leads to a heavy and bulky
GPS-cat collar. Thanks to our patented energy-efficient technology for micro
GPS-tracking we have found an expert solution to this problem.



The safety of your cat comes first!

Of course, the safety of your cat is paramount and the
petTracer GPS-cat collar comes with a safety
release which opens instantly should your cat ever get caught somewhere. We use
commercially available and proven safety releases since we do not want to risk
your cat's health.

Universal ring
The petTracer
GPS-cat collar comes with a ring for attaching a bell or magnet for your cat
flap at home.


The petTracer Web Portal 
You can
easily configure and manage the petTracer GPS-cat collar through the petTracer web-portal.
All your cats' names are tagged on the digital map to allow you to follow their
movements at any time. Set safety and danger zones around your house, adjust
the alert messaging service, manage account access rights of family members or
check the current battery charge among many other things. Our website also
offers valuable general know-how about cats and provides all cat lovers with a
variety of additional services.

Digital MapEasily monitor your cat's whereabouts via Google Maps
from any place at anytime.



The covered distance is traced constantly and can be
accessed and analyzed at any chosen time. This allows you to gather a variety of
statistical data about your cat. The cat’s walking area or his favourite hiding
places are just a couple of examples. Have you ever wondered how many meters or
even kilometres your cat covers in a day, a month or a year or how fast he is
when he’s on the move? How large is your cat's territory? Or are you curious if
your cat occasionally gets snacks at your neighbour's house?


Our dedicated smartphone application is free and
available for Apple and Android. It offers easy access to the most important
features of the GPS-cat collar. All the features of the petTracer GPS-cat
collar are also available via web-browser and on any computer with internet
access.

What you need for the petTracer GPS-cat collar to work

In order to
track your cat you will need a:

petTracer GPS-cat collar

petTracer HomeStation (Receiver and Charger)

computer with internet connection (for initial setup)

wireless router (WLAN or WiFi)


computer, smartphone or tablet with internet connection for tracking
monthly service subscription





How the  petTracer system works


The GPS signal is received by the petTracer GPS-cat collar that your cat wears. The
GPS coordinates are then transmitted to the petTracer HomeStation (receiver).
The coordinates are forwarded through the internet connection to the petTracer
server. The server is then accessed via Smartphone, computer or tablet to
locate your cat.
Tracks of your cats are recorded constantly. This
ensures that you will find your cat even in areas without reception.

Harmful Mobile Phone Emission

There is a big debate on the question whether mobile
phone emission poses any health risks. Since your cat is very dear to you, we
did not want to take any risks. For this reason we have pursued a solution
which is free of any mobile phone radiation and have therefore left this
particular discussion to others.
Perks Overview
The follow up costs for the service subscription
amount to $5 - $8 per month depending on the contract and an extra $2 - $4 for
every additional petTracer GPS-cat collar in the same house hold (reduced service
subscription is limited to five collars).

Timeline


Risks and Challenges

During the last years of development
we have been facing many challenges. With the completion of the functional
prototype and miniaturization of electronic components, the greatest risks have
been eliminated. But of course, like any innovative project, there are
additional risks and challenges.
Challenges arise in completion
of the software and smartphone apps. As we work together with very experienced
programmers and web-designers we are confident to have these risks under
control. 
We have already started to
line up the supply chain for mass production. We are working together with
experts to assemble the electronic components and manufacturing the GPS-cat collar.
At this point all the electronic components are available on the market, but
terms of delivery and availability vary. As soon as we reach our goal we will
order all the electronic components to make sure we have them ready in time for
production. Both our manufacturers are able to adapt production to our needs.
We are testing the petTracer
GPS-cat collar according to CE and FCC guidelines to meet international
standards. According to our supplier we should not experience any problems for
passing these tests. But there is still the risk of not passing these tests the
first time round. If we have to re-test, it could have an impact on the
delivery date.
Extensive user tests are
planned for January and February 2015. Even though we have tried to take
everything into consideration as well as possible, there still is the
possibility of having overlooked
something. Depending on the nature of any potential issues, we might need more
time than expected to solve them.

FAQ


How long does the battery last?
PetTracer is a real life
tracking system that constantly tracks your cat. However, we managed to build a
collar which comes with a battery life of several weeks. This was only
possible due to our patented, safe trace-technique developed in the early phase
of the project. The collar guarantees the highest possible comfort for your cat
and with a much longer battery life compared to other products on the marked
(battery life of 1 to max. 7 days and an average weight of about 50g). 

How big is the  petTracer GPS-Cat collar?

The collar is just a tiny
bit bigger than any regular collar. Dimensions are: 14mm wide, 200mm - 280mm
long and between 2 - 7mm high (the 7mm height are the battery and GPS receiver
only). 

What is the range of the
 petTracer GPS-Cat collar?


The system consists of a
collar and receiver and works with a radio-signal. It can send and receive
signals up to a distance of 1.5 km (1.43 mi), thus the system covers an area of
up to 7km2 (2.7 mi2). The quality and distance depends on
the type of area. Additional
HomeStations can be used to increase the coverage area. This is
automatically the case, if cat owners using a petTracer system are living
nearby. The result is an extended network of HomeStations (mesh network), which
can be used by all collars. But of course only you can see your own cats.
However, in a ground-breaking
experiment done by the BBC 2 Horizon in collaboration with the Royal Veterinary
Collage and with 50 cats from a village in Surrey UK, it was discovered that a
distance of around 200 m, in combination with a safety zone, is sufficient for
most domestic cats.

Is the petTracer GPS-cat collar safe to wear for my cat?

At this point we do not
know if mobile phone emission really is harmful to us or not. As human beings
it is our own choice to own a mobile phone. Your cat doesn't have this freedom
should you decide to fasten a collar around its neck. Your cat's health is the
most important aspect, so we are not taking any risk and decided to follow a solution
which is free of mobile phone
networks. Our solution has a radiation level that is 100 times below that of
standard mobile phone network dependable devices. Don't risk the health of your
cat by buying harmful devices - after all it will wear the collar every day,
day and night.


petTracer - damit Sie jederzeit wissen,
wo Ihre Katze steckt!

petTracer - Das erste
ultraleichte GPS Katzenhalsband, welches bedenkenlos für Katzen eingesetzt
werden kann!

Tausende von Katzen
werden täglich vermisst! Nicht selten bleiben sie über Tage oder Wochen
verschwunden. In vielen Fällen bleiben sie leider für immer unauffindbar
und kehren nie mehr zu ihren Haltern zurück. Da sie uns ans Herz gewachsen sind
und einen zentralen Platz in unserer
Familie einnehmen, kann ein Katzenverlust ausserordentlich emotional und
schmerzhaft sein!


Wenn Sie genug haben von Produkten, die aktuell für das Lokalisieren von
Katzen angeboten werden, obwohl sie für Hunde, Schlüssel oder sogar Fahrzeuge
entwickelt wurden, dann gibt es gute Nachrichten.Wir haben petTracer
entwickelt – das erste ultraleichte GPS Katzenhalsband, welches bedenkenlos für
Katzen eingesetzt werden kann! 







Wir haben ein GPS-Halsband von Grund auf für Katzen entwickelt – und nur für Katzen!


Mit seinem einzigartigen Design, seiner
minimalen Grösse und dem tiefen Gewicht ist das petTracer GPS Katzenhalsband
wie jedes herkömmliche Halsband. Der Tragekomfort für die Katze stand beim
Design unseres Halsbands im Vordergrund. 






Presse / Medien




Das ultraleichte petTracer GPS Katzenhalsband ist etwas Einzigartiges und
die Technologie wurde genau auf die Bedürfnisse der Katzen und ihre Halter entwickelt.
Es hat deshalb in der Schweiz bereits grosse mediale Aufmerksamkeit erhalten.




Das petTracer GPS Katzenhalsband im Detail


Das petTracer Team befasst sich seit einigen
Jahren intensiv mit Katzen, deren Verhalten, Lebensräumen und Bedürfnissen.
Langjährige und intensive Forschungs- und Pionierarbeit im Bereich
Stromsparverfahren für ""Mikro GPS Anwendungen"" wurde geleistet. Nur
dank diesem fundierten Knowhow ist es gelungen, ein funktionierendes, ultraleichtes
und präzises Hightech-GPS-Katzenhalsband nach Schweizer Qualitätsmassstäben zu
entwickeln und zu patentieren (angemeldet).


Es ist extrem klein und schmal...




...sieht aus wie ein herkömmliches
Halsband...


...und mit rund 20 Gramm ist es ultraleicht!
Nebst der
Batterielebensdauer ist das geringe Gewicht die grösste Herausforderung, um ein
GPS Katzenhalsband herzustellen. Es war daher von Anfang an unser ehrgeiziges
Ziel, ein Halsband zu entwickeln, welches weniger als 25 Gramm wiegt. Jedes
Halsband, welches mehr als 25 Gramm wiegt ist für eine Katze unzumutbar.






Das petTracer GPS Katzenhalsband hat eine
beachtlich lange Akkulaufzeit von bis zu 4 Wochen! 



Das scheinbar nahezu unlösbare Problem stellte die Energieversorgung des GPS
Katzenhalsbandes dar. Eine lange Betriebszeit bedeutet einen hohen
Energieverbrauch. Demzufolge wird eine entsprechend grosse Batterie benötigt,
was zwangsläufig zu erhöhtem Gewicht und unhandlicher Grösse des GPS
Katzenhalsbandes führt. Dank unserem international patentierten Stromsparverfahren für Mikro
GPS Anwendungen haben wir dieses Problem gelöst.


Die Sicherheit Ihrer Katze kommt an erster Stelle!
Dank dem Ein-Klick-Sicherheitsverschluss wird das Strangulieren Ihrer Katze verhindert. Er öffnet sich unverzüglich, falls sich Ihre Katze verfängt. Mit der Verwendung eines im Markt erprobten Sicherheitsverschlusses setzt petTracer auf Bewährtes und geht keine unnötigen Risiken in Bezug auf die Sicherheit von Katzen ein.




Universalring
Das petTracer GPS Katzenhalsband verfügt zudem über einen Ring, um eine Glocke
zu befestigen und lässt sich mit Vorrichtungen zum Öffnen von Katzentüren
kombinieren.




Das petTracer Web Portal 



Wir bieten den Katzenliebhabern ein Portal – das PetTracer Portal - an, mit
dem ein oder mehrere petTracer GPS Katzenhalsbänder mühelos verwaltet werden
können. Auf der digitalen Karte sehen Sie jederzeit alle Ihre Katzen mit Namen
beschriftet. Ferner können verschiedene Sicherheitszonen festgesetzt, die Betreuung gezielt an Freunde oder Nachbarn delegiert, zurückgelegte
Strecken in gewünschter Weise angezeigt, der Katzenname zugeordnet sowie auch
die Zugriffsrechte verwalten werden. Ebenso können Sie sich benachrichtigen
lassen, wenn der Ladestand der Batterie kritisch wird oder Ihre Katze die
Sicherheitszone verlässt. Zusätzlich bietet das PetTracer Portal viele
wertvolle Informationen über Katzen im Allgemeinen und zahlreiche weitere
Dienste für Katzenfreunde.


Digitale Karte
Orten
Sie Ihre Katze jederzeit und von überall mithilfe von Google-Maps.

Zurückgelegte Strecken
werden konstant aufgezeichnet und können nach Belieben aufgerufen und
analysiert werden. So können verschiedenste Statistiken über Ihre Katze
angezeigt werden. Wie weit geht Ihre Katze und wo sind ihre liebsten
Aufenthaltsorte? Haben Sie sich schon gefragt, wie viele Meter oder gar Kilometer
Ihre Katze an einem Tag, pro Monat oder Jahr zurücklegt? Oder wie schnell sie
unterwegs ist, wie gross ihr Revier ist und wo sie fremd gefüttert wird?
Unsere Smartphone
Applikation ist kostenlos für Apple- und Androidgeräte verfügbar und bietet
einen einfachen Zugang zu den wichtigsten Funktionen rund ums GPS
Katzenhalsband. Steht kein Smartphone oder Tablet zur Verfügung, so können sämtliche
Funktionen auch via Webbrowser auf jedem beliebigen PC mit Internetanschluss
ausgeführt werden.



Was benötigen Sie für den Betrieb des petTracer GPS Katzenhalsbands?

Um Ihrer Katze auf der Spur zu bleiben benötigen Sie: 

ein petTracer GPS Katzenhalsband
eine petTracer HomeStation (Empfänger und Ladestation)
einen Computer mit Internetverbindung (für die Erstinbetriebnahme)
einen Wireless-Router (WLAN,
WiFi)

einen Computer, ein Smartphone oder Tablet mit Internetverbindung für das
Tracking
Ein Service Abonnement





Wie das petTracer System funktioniert





Das petTracer GPS Katzenhalsband empfängt das GPS Signal. Die Koordinaten
werden zur petTracer HomeStation (Empfänger) übermittelt und zum petTracer
Server weitergeleitet. Mittels Smartphone, Computer oder Tablet können Sie auf diesen zugreifen und Ihre Katze orten. Die Spuren Ihrer Katze werden konstant
aufgezeichnet. Dies ermöglicht, dass Sie Ihre Katze auch in Bereichen ohne
Empfang finden können. 


Schädliche Mobilfunk-Strahlung




Der Kontroverse über die Schädlichkeit von Mobilfunk-Strahlung geht
petTracer aus dem Weg. Da uns die Gesundheit Ihrer Katze sehr am Herz liegt,
wollten wir keine Risiken diesbezüglich eingehen. Mit der 100mal
strahlungsärmeren, harmlosen Schmalband-Funk-Technologie überlassen wir die Diskussion
über die Schädlichkeit eines GPS-Katzenhalsbandes mit permanenter Handy-Strahlung
anderen.


Angebotsübersicht


Die Folgekosten für das Serviceabonnement belaufen sich je nach Vertragsdauer auf $5 bis $8 pro Monat und $2 bis $4 für jedes weitere petTracer GPS Katzenhalsband im gleichen Haushalt (limitiert auf 5).

Risiken & Herausforderungen


Während den vergangenen Jahren der Entwicklungsarbeiten haben wir sehr viele
Herausforderungen gemeistert. Mit der Fertigstellung des funktionalen Prototyps und
der Miniaturisierung der Hardware auf Originalgrösse, haben wir die grössten
Risiken eliminiert. 

Die Software für Smartphone Apps muss fertiggestellt werden und hier könnten
zusätzliche Probleme auftauchen. Wir arbeiten jedoch mit sehr kompetenten
Software-Entwicklern mit jahrelanger Erfahrung zusammen und sind sehr
zuversichtlich, dass wir diese Risiken weitgehend unter Kontrolle haben.


Wir haben damit begonnen, die ersten Schritte für die Serienproduktion
einzuleiten. Hierfür arbeiten wir mit mehreren Produktionsexperten zusammen, dessen
Kerngebiete das Assemblieren elektronischer Komponenten und die Verarbeitung
des Halsbandes sind. Zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt sind alle Komponenten im Markt
verfügbar. Die Konditionen bezüglich Verfügbarkeit können sich jedoch ändern
und wir haben keinen Einfluss darauf. Sobald wir unser Kampagnenziel erreichen,
werden wir möglichst alle zeitkritischen Komponenten einkaufen. Unsere
Lieferanten sind in der Lage, ihre Kapazitäten für unsere Bedürfnisse auszuweiten.


Wir werden das petTracer GPS Katzenhalsband CE und FCC zertifizieren lassen, um
nationale und internationale Standards einzuhalten. Obwohl wir hier nicht mit
Problemen rechnen, kann es trotzdem vorkommen, dass wir den FCC-Test nicht beim
ersten Mal bestehen. Dies hätte zur Folge, dass wir einen zweiten Test machen
müssen, was sich auf den Auslieferungstermin auswirken könnte.

Ein umfangreicher Benutzertest ist zwischen Januar und Februar 2015 vorgesehen.
Wir haben diesen bereits sorgfältig geplant. Aber es gibt immer etwas Unvorhergesehenes
und wir wissen zu diesem Zeitpunkt nicht, ob wir genügend Zeitreserven
eingeplant haben.

Häufig gestellte Fragen

Wie leicht ist das petTracer GPS Katzenhalsband? 

Das Halsband wiegt weniger als 25g. Bei petTracer ist alles
im Halsband integriert. PetTracer ist kein Gerät, welches zusätzlich an
ein bestehendes Halsband angebracht werden muss. Es kommt also kein weiteres
Gewicht dazu! 
Wie lange hält der Akku? 


Das PetTracer Katzenhalsband zeichnet die gesamten zurückgelegten Strecken
Ihrer Katze konstant auf. Und trotzdem haben wir es geschafft, die Laufzeit des
Akkus auf mehrere Wochen zu erhöhen. Dies konnten wir nur dank unserer
aufwändig entwickelten und patentierten SafeTrace Technologie realisieren. Das
PetTracer GPS Katzenhalsband bietet eine erhebliche Erhöhung des Tragekomforts für
die Katze bei längerer Energieversorgung im Vergleich zu andern Produkten (Laufzeiten
von 1 bis maximal 7 Tagen und Gewichten ab ca. 50 Gramm).

Hat das petTracer
GPS Katzenhalsband einen Sicherheitsverschluss? 

Ja! Das petTracer Katzenhalsband ist mit einem
handelsüblichen Sicherheitsverschluss ausgestattet. Dieser öffnet sich sofort,
sobald Ihre Katze in Gefahr ist. Mit der Verwendung eines erprobten
Sicherheitsverschlusses setzt petTracer auf Bewährtes und geht keine unnötigen
Risiken in Bezug auf die Sicherheit von Katzen ein.

Wie gross ist das petTracer GPS Katzenhalsband? 

Es ist lediglich ein wenig grösser als ein herkömmliches
Katzenhalsband. Abmessungen: 14mm breit, 20-28cm lang und zwischen 4 und 7mm
dünn (7mm lediglich beim Akku und der GPS-Antenne). 

Wozu brauche ich den Universalring am petTracer GPS Katzenhalsband?



Der Universalring ermöglicht Ihnen das Anbringen einer kleine Glocke oder einem
Türöffner für Ihre Katzentüre. Sie können somit alles Mögliche am petTracer
Halsband Ihrer Katze befestigen und benötigen kein separates Halsband mehr. Falls
Sie nichts Zusätzliches befestigen möchten, können Sie den Ring einfach
entfernen! 

Wie gross ist die
Reichweite des petTracer GPS Katzenhalsbands? 





Das System setzt sich aus einem Halsband und einem Empfänger (HomeStaion) zusammen
und kommuniziert über eine strahlungsarme Funkverbindung. Es kann unter
günstigen Bedingungen bis zu 7km2 abdecken. Die Reichweite ist abhängig von der Umgebung und kann, falls notwendig, durch Einsatz von zusätzlichen Empfängern (HomeStationen) erhöht werden. Dies ist
automatisch der Fall, wenn andere Katzenfreunde in ihrer Nähe auch petTracer
GPS Katzenhalsbänder im Einsatz haben. Diese bilden dann ein erweitertes Netz,
das allen nützt. Trotzdem sehen nur Sie Ihre Katzen.
In einer gross angelegten Studie von „BBC two Horizon“ in Zusammenarbeit mit
dem Royal Veterinary Collage mit 50 Katzen in der Stadt Surrey (GB) wurden
viele interessante Details über das Verhalten von Katzen untersucht. Es stellte
sich heraus, dass eine Distanz von 200m in Kombination mit einer
Sicherheitszone in den meisten Fällen ausreichend ist.

Kann ich das petTracer GPS Katzenhalsband meiner Katze bedenkenlos anziehen? 



Bis zum heutigen Tag wissen wir nichts Abschliessendes über die
Schädlichkeit von Mobilfunk-Strahlung bei Katzen. Sie können selber
entscheiden, ob Sie ein Mobiltelefon mit sich tragen wollen. Sollten Sie sich
dazu entscheiden, Ihrer Katzen ein GPS-Halsband anzuziehen, kann sich Ihre
Katze nicht dazu äussern. Die Gesundheit Ihrer Katze ist für uns der wichtigste
Aspekt. Um diesbezüglich keine unnötigen Risiken einzugehen, haben wir uns für
eine Variante ohne Mobilfunk-Netzwerk entschlossen. Unsere Lösung ist ca. 100 mal strahlungsärmer als Geräte, die mittels Mobilfunk (GSM) arbeiten. Riskieren Sie nicht die Gesundheit Ihrer Katze mit einem möglicherweise schädlichen Gerät. Ihre Katze wird das Halsband immer tragen, Tag und Nacht!",31.0,1,"1 Campaign

This activity aim at younger generation will also touch the idea of implementing Reduce, Reuse, Recyle in their daily life. 
We also produce 3 different products which is a environmental monopoly games in cooperation with environmental community in Jakarta, snake and ladder and ludo that has been modified for teaching kid age 7-11 about environment and pollution. 
Funding 
For the implementation of the projects, we will need $450 for purchasing 15 garbage bins to be placed around the tourism sites and public facilities in the village. 
We will also need $150 for the printing cost for environmental signs. 
In total we need $650. 
For the speaker fee, transportation cost, 50 tumbler and reusable bags cost, shipping cost for the games production, and other activity that need funcing will be covered through our own budget. 
The Impact
It will bring positive impact for the people in Morella village, since for the last 3 years we have seen a steady increase in number of tourist visiting this village but however from 2015, there is no improvement of waste management facilities in the village. 
It will address basic needs of environmental facilities at the very first step towards a better waste management system within the village. 
It will also increase basic understanding of the society about environment especially younger generation.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Hola,</p>
<p>Somos comjeruma, una cooperativa multisectorial de jóvenes émprendedores productores y este es nuestra campaña de crowdfunding</p>
<p>Comjeruma quiere expandirse territorialmente para brindar oportunidades principalmente a jóvenes originarios de comunidades que están siendo afectadas por problemas sociales como violencia familiar, trata de personas, grupos juveniles (pandillas) los cuales han afectado seriamente a la juventud.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Desde el punto de vista social, a través de la implementación de los fondos recaudados dará la oportunidad que más jóvenes puedan tener acceso a la generación de divisas para mejorar sus condiciones de vida, considerando que los apicultores con los que trabajamos son jóvenes y están ubicados en comunidades muy vulnerables, en las que la apicultura se ha convertido una manera oportuna para generar recursos para su familia, y al mismo tiempo, gracias a la estrategia de responsabilidad ambiental de COMJERUMA, cada uno de los apicultores atendidos tiene la tarea y compromiso de realizar actividades ambientales en pro de la apicultura y de mejoramiento del medio ambiente, como es el establecimiento de viveros y reforestación con especies nectarpoliníferas, jornadas de limpieza, utilización de productos naturales para la producción, protección de fuentes de agua, uso racional de los recursos naturales y sensibilización a sus familias sobre las prácticas amigables para el medio ambiente, de manera que este tipo de acciones darán una mayor resiliencia a estas familias a los efectos del cambio climático en nuestro país.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>También es importante sensibilizar a las comunidades sobre el uso racional de los recursos naturales, ya que es la población humana la principal responsable del deterioro de los recursos naturales, por lo que se llevan a cabo sensibilización con las familias sobre la <u>NO</u> quema, la reforestación, la no utilización de productos químicos y la de cuidar a las abejas, de manera que si existen enjambres silvestres que se consideren como un riesgo para las comunidades se pueda solicitar gratuitamente a la Cooperativa para extraer las abejas y orientar su ubicación hacia lugares donde cumplen con las normas de seguridad para la población.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>COMJERUMA tiene como tarea y compromiso social con la comunidad, por lo que se tiene proyectado trabajar con un grupo de productores del Municipio de San José de Cusmapa, organizados en una pequeña Cooperativa llamada “Cataluña”, los cuales todos sus miembros son padres de niños con capacidades diferentes, y tienen como propósito implementar acciones productivas en sus comunidades para disponer de mayor cantidad de recursos y mejorarle las condiciones de vida a sus hijos con capacidades diferente, lo que COMJERUMA, ya ha iniciado a trabajar con este grupo y tiene como objetivo seguir trabajando fuerte para que este grupo de productores pueda salir adelante y probar que todo es posible con emprendimiento y persistencia.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>COMJERUMA ha realizado actividades socialmente responsables en la comunidad como es: acudir a los llamados de la población en general de las comunidades y de la ciudad de Somoto que se hacen directamente a la Cooperativa o a través de los Bomberos para extraer enjambres de abejas africanizadas en lugares donde representan peligro para niños, adultos y ancianos; la Cooperativa envía a personal calificado para la extracción de los enjambres gratuitamente. También hemos contribuido con recaudación de fondos para ayudar al asilo de ancianos, también para el equipamiento de la Cruz Roja Nicaraguense.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>En resumen, los impactos ambientales y sociales son positivos y queremos seguir brindando mas cambios positivos a estas coomunidades rurales en Nicaragua. Por eso, necesitamos tu ayuda para seguir creciendo y por eso estamos pidiendo recaudar $15,000 con su ayuda para seguir adelante.</p>
<p>Hey,</p>

<p>In addition to the families being aware of the responsible use of resources, it i also very important that the wider communities are also aware, due to the fact that it is us humans who are responsible for the deterioration of the world´s natural resources. Therefore our beekeepers carry out awareness campaigns about not burning rubbish, reforestation, utilizing non-chemical products and how to take care of bees and beehives that may be dangerous – in which case the cooperative offers a free service to extract the bees and change their location to  a place where all health and safety regulations are properly followed.</p>
<p>In summary, the environmental and social impacts of COMJERUMA are positive. For that reason, we would like to keep growing and expanding so that we can keep on making positive changes within vulnerable rural communities in Nicaragua and to do that we need your help!

</div></div>","Hola,
Somos comjeruma, una cooperativa multisectorial de jóvenes émprendedores productores y este es nuestra campaña de crowdfunding
Comjeruma quiere expandirse territorialmente para brindar oportunidades principalmente a jóvenes originarios de comunidades que están siendo afectadas por problemas sociales como violencia familiar, trata de personas, grupos juveniles (pandillas) los cuales han afectado seriamente a la juventud.
 
Desde el punto de vista social, a través de la implementación de los fondos recaudados dará la oportunidad que más jóvenes puedan tener acceso a la generación de divisas para mejorar sus condiciones de vida, considerando que los apicultores con los que trabajamos son jóvenes y están ubicados en comunidades muy vulnerables, en las que la apicultura se ha convertido una manera oportuna para generar recursos para su familia, y al mismo tiempo, gracias a la estrategia de responsabilidad ambiental de COMJERUMA, cada uno de los apicultores atendidos tiene la tarea y compromiso de realizar actividades ambientales en pro de la apicultura y de mejoramiento del medio ambiente, como es el establecimiento de viveros y reforestación con especies nectarpoliníferas, jornadas de limpieza, utilización de productos naturales para la producción, protección de fuentes de agua, uso racional de los recursos naturales y sensibilización a sus familias sobre las prácticas amigables para el medio ambiente, de manera que este tipo de acciones darán una mayor resiliencia a estas familias a los efectos del cambio climático en nuestro país.
 
También es importante sensibilizar a las comunidades sobre el uso racional de los recursos naturales, ya que es la población humana la principal responsable del deterioro de los recursos naturales, por lo que se llevan a cabo sensibilización con las familias sobre la NO quema, la reforestación, la no utilización de productos químicos y la de cuidar a las abejas, de manera que si existen enjambres silvestres que se consideren como un riesgo para las comunidades se pueda solicitar gratuitamente a la Cooperativa para extraer las abejas y orientar su ubicación hacia lugares donde cumplen con las normas de seguridad para la población.
 
COMJERUMA tiene como tarea y compromiso social con la comunidad, por lo que se tiene proyectado trabajar con un grupo de productores del Municipio de San José de Cusmapa, organizados en una pequeña Cooperativa llamada “Cataluña”, los cuales todos sus miembros son padres de niños con capacidades diferentes, y tienen como propósito implementar acciones productivas en sus comunidades para disponer de mayor cantidad de recursos y mejorarle las condiciones de vida a sus hijos con capacidades diferente, lo que COMJERUMA, ya ha iniciado a trabajar con este grupo y tiene como objetivo seguir trabajando fuerte para que este grupo de productores pueda salir adelante y probar que todo es posible con emprendimiento y persistencia.
 
COMJERUMA ha realizado actividades socialmente responsables en la comunidad como es: acudir a los llamados de la población en general de las comunidades y de la ciudad de Somoto que se hacen directamente a la Cooperativa o a través de los Bomberos para extraer enjambres de abejas africanizadas en lugares donde representan peligro para niños, adultos y ancianos; la Cooperativa envía a personal calificado para la extracción de los enjambres gratuitamente. También hemos contribuido con recaudación de fondos para ayudar al asilo de ancianos, también para el equipamiento de la Cruz Roja Nicaraguense.
 
En resumen, los impactos ambientales y sociales son positivos y queremos seguir brindando mas cambios positivos a estas coomunidades rurales en Nicaragua. Por eso, necesitamos tu ayuda para seguir creciendo y por eso estamos pidiendo recaudar $15,000 con su ayuda para seguir adelante.

Bees are
truly fascinating beings. These little creatures are extremely important for
the wellbeing of humans. Roughly a third of the foods that are consumed by us
humans only grow because these insects pollinate them. 

<p>Unfortunately,
bees aren’t doing very well nowadays. Places that used to be full of various
blossoming meadows, have now become large grain fields. Bees often
come in contact with pesticides and other poisons when they are on their foraging
flight. And as if that wasn’t enough, their deadly enemy is lurking in their
home: the Varroa mite.</p>
<p>Over the last decades, this parasite has spread over the
majority of the world, making it extremely hard for the bees. Despite
beekeepers treating their bees with different remedies to reduce losses, millions (!)
of bee colonies die each year. 

</p>
<p>Even though
I treated my bee colonies too, I still lost many. But I just didn’t want to
accept that. I knew that another chemical treatment wouldn’t be the solution. I
was looking for alternatives and came across a British inventor, who, after
long-term experiments, achieved promising results.</p>
<p>The VARROA BUSTER is a further developed version of that product and is used in addition
to regular treatments. The hexagonal gadget comes with a clip and can easily be attached to any
kind of hive without any additional tools and doesn't prevent the beekeeper from
doing his job the way he's used to.</p>

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>How the VARROA BUSTER works<br/>
</h3>
<br/>Under
magnification the gadgets backside shows thousands upon thousands of tiny,
razor sharp shards covering its surface, which, when viewed under the microscope,
looks like a field of broken glass bottles firmly cemented into the disc. <br/><p>The coating consists of specially composed biolites. These are sedimentary rocks that were formed by living organisms thousands of years ago.<br/></p>
<p>As
you can see here, Varroa mites are covered with bristles which make it really
hard for the bees to get rid of their enemies.</p>

themselves against the surface of the VARROA BUSTER by crawling behind the disc to get rid of the mites from both, the front and the back of their bodies, equally as good. This results in the
shards  snagging the hooks covering the mites. At the same time the Varroa mites
wax coat is cut open and their soft internal tissue is exposed. <br/><br/>This quickly
kills the mites through dehydration. Dehydration is a safe and simple killer;
the parasite loses its strength and relaxes its grip. It then falls off and
dies. For tiny creatures such as mites, the surface is a deadly trap. However,
it's no problem for the much larger bees. It's recommended to use two of the
VARROA BUSTER gadgets for each hive. They work for one year before they need
replacement.

doesn't require electricity either and works mechanically. Therefore, there is

Salam (Peace) from Palestine! 
The Marda
Permaculture Farm is a working farm and a demonstration site for
permaculture principles, techniques and strategies in Palestine. Based
in the picturesque ancient village of Marda, the project promotes food sovereignty, health,
self-reliance and empowerment.  This is
accomplished through modeling water harvesting, recycling, energy conservation
and home-scale garden production with readily available and locally-appropriate
materials. 
The Farm is a model of sustainable development and self-sufficiency for the whole of Palestine and to build connections with permaculture projects regionally and internationally. It is the vision of the farm to provide Palestinians with a demonstration site to revive traditional knowledge and practices in farming, sustainable living and community building.  
Palestine has been undergoing a vicious alienation and dispossession of its people from their land, resources and traditional livelihoods by the Israeli occupation and its practices. Today, we are working on building a strong local movement to strengthen local economy, enhance resilience of our farming communities and reach self sufficiency and dependency to achieve sovereignty and sustainability of our communities. One of our main outreach activities is conducting the international Permaculture Design Course (PDC), accomplished through a 2-weeks permaculture theoretical and practical training for Palestinian women, men, and farmers—as well as international students, interns and apprentices. The upcoming course will take place from the 25th of September to the 9th of October 2013.  
The funding will go to cover the expenses of 7 Palestinian studentsn, who cannot cover the course expenses but are very enthusiastic and committed to building resilience in Palestine. Our farm and vision is strengthened by local students attending and continuing their work in the field of farming and sustainable agriculture. We are building a pool of local expertise and knowledge to enhance our cause for a just and sustainable world for all.

<div>I'm sure you must be wondering what this is all about; a map of North America with some animals strategically placed on it.  Wonder no longer!  These fine-looking creatures are a small sampling of the endangered species of the North American continent. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The idea came to me simply enough.  I was in the process of researching a fun all-ages geography text which will be published professionally late in 2013 and upon coming to the biogeography section I was startled to discover how many species we are in danger of losing.  I actually completed my geography degree at UCLA with concentrations in biogeography and climatology so I am no stranger to the concept of extinction.  The rate of loss is really quite astounding.  Some strides have been made to revive near-extinct species, but there is still much that needs to be done.  I decided to take a step towards that goal.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The goal of my project is two-pronged.  I will be publishing an AD-FREE website with lots of original photos and videos so people can see what we're in danger of losing.  The website will contain links to specific organizations people can contribute to or volunteer with to help save the critter in question.  What makes this website different is the sheer number of photos and other media it will contain.  All media will be made available as public domain, as well.  The more exposure, the greater the chance of survival.  I also will be publishing an e-book with different photos.  It can be enjoyed by both children and adults.  All proceeds (100%) from the sale of the book will go towards organizations dedicated to saving endangered species.  When you donate to this project, your funds will go farther than you can imagine!  I will update the website frequently with information about where everything is going.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<h2>What Will You Do With My Pledge?</h2>
<p>That is an excellent question!  I'm glad you asked.  I am requesting funding for the upkeep of the website.  A dedicated server, domain name, extra bandwidth (if needed) and the cost of publicity are requirements for a successful website.  In addition, I am also seeking the funds for the required travel and entrance fees associated with photographing and videotaping some of the most elusive animals on our planet.  In many cases, I will need a guide of some sort.  I have already contacted a few professionals and, if I get the required funding (please pledge!), I can meet with them.  </p>
<p>I am requesting $5500 in support of this goal.  A portion of this goes towards indiegogo and paypal.  The rest will be used for the above objective.  Please remember that the more funding I receive, the more comprehensive the book and website will be.</p>
<p>I have some great rewards for you guys.  All you need to do is pledge $10 to get a digital copy of the book.  That's all it takes!  $50 gets your name and photo (if desired) on the ""Acknowledgements"" page of the website as well as the e-book.  $75 is the best!  You get all of the above, plus your name listed in the acknowledgements in the ebook and any future physical copy of the book.  Wow!  Those are some cool rewards.</p>
<p>If I do not achieve my goal of $5500 I will be required to pay indiegogo almost $550, so please help me out.  I am a strong believer in crowdfunding and have personally pledged to more than 20 projects.  Many of them have been successful.  I hope this project will be among the success stories.  Our wildlife is counting on us.</p>

<h2>What Else Can I Do?</h2>
<p>Another good question!  If you are unable to contribute monetarily, you can still help by spreading the word about this project.  There are all manner of ""share"" tools you can use to spread the word through facebook,  e-mail, your website, etc.  Word of mouth is pretty awesome, too.  Thank you for your support.</p></div>","What The Heck Is This?
I'm sure you must be wondering what this is all about; a map of North America with some animals strategically placed on it.  Wonder no longer!  These fine-looking creatures are a small sampling of the endangered species of the North American continent. 
 
The idea came to me simply enough.  I was in the process of researching a fun all-ages geography text which will be published professionally late in 2013 and upon coming to the biogeography section I was startled to discover how many species we are in danger of losing.  I actually completed my geography degree at UCLA with concentrations in biogeography and climatology so I am no stranger to the concept of extinction.  The rate of loss is really quite astounding.  Some strides have been made to revive near-extinct species, but there is still much that needs to be done.  I decided to take a step towards that goal.  
 
The goal of my project is two-pronged.  I will be publishing an AD-FREE website with lots of original photos and videos so people can see what we're in danger of losing.  The website will contain links to specific organizations people can contribute to or volunteer with to help save the critter in question.  What makes this website different is the sheer number of photos and other media it will contain.  All media will be made available as public domain, as well.  The more exposure, the greater the chance of survival.  I also will be publishing an e-book with different photos.  It can be enjoyed by both children and adults.  All proceeds (100%) from the sale of the book will go towards organizations dedicated to saving endangered species.  When you donate to this project, your funds will go farther than you can imagine!  I will update the website frequently with information about where everything is going.
 
 
What Will You Do With My Pledge?
That is an excellent question!  I'm glad you asked.  I am requesting funding for the upkeep of the website.  A dedicated server, domain name, extra bandwidth (if needed) and the cost of publicity are requirements for a successful website.  In addition, I am also seeking the funds for the required travel and entrance fees associated with photographing and videotaping some of the most elusive animals on our planet.  In many cases, I will need a guide of some sort.  I have already contacted a few professionals and, if I get the required funding (please pledge!), I can meet with them.  
I am requesting $5500 in support of this goal.  A portion of this goes towards indiegogo and paypal.  The rest will be used for the above objective.  Please remember that the more funding I receive, the more comprehensive the book and website will be.
I have some great rewards for you guys.  All you need to do is pledge $10 to get a digital copy of the book.  That's all it takes!  $50 gets your name and photo (if desired) on the ""Acknowledgements"" page of the website as well as the e-book.  $75 is the best!  You get all of the above, plus your name listed in the acknowledgements in the ebook and any future physical copy of the book.  Wow!  Those are some cool rewards.

<p><span>As a photographer, the word ""envisioning"" is very powerful and dear to me, and I often envision a world in balance and with equality, where humans and other inhabitants live in conscious harmony. A world filled with openness, acceptance, creative art, and joy, where deeds are done out of kindness for others and respect for nature, instead of profits, and we no longer ""fight"" towards peace, but simply live in peace.</span></p>
<p><span>These are ideals far greater than myself, or any one individual, for that matter. It is very easy to become overwhelmed with all these tremendous global issues, and simply throw in the towel. The way I see it though, is that we ought to discover and work towards that particular thing we are most passionate about, and have faith that others will (if not already) fill the rest of the niches in a connected movement.</span></p>
<p><span>I do believe that global movement is underway; some of that magic has been seen by my own eyes, as well as captured with my cameras.</span></p>

<p></p>
<p>In the past 5 months, I have spent superbly quality time on 3 farms and intentional communities in British Columbia and Washington (<a href=""http://rollingearth.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rolling Earth Farm &amp; Retreat</a>, <span id=""mySelectedSpan""><a href=""http://chuckleberrycommunity.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chuckleberry Community</a></span>, and <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/8thStreetGreens"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">8th Street Greens</a>), met characters I will never forget, and gathered stories and experiences I would not have gained anywhere else.

<p></p>
<p><span>As autumn is beginning to set in, the big plan now is to take the ride of my life down the majestic west coast - from the coast of mainland British Columbia, down to Vancouver Island and towards the lush Olympic Peninsula, through the entirety of the Oregon coastline while visiting <a href=""http://members.pioneer.net/~alpha/index.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Alpha Farm</a>, nestled in the coastal mountain ranges, for a week, then crossing the awe-inspiring Redwoods of northern California, down the Pacific Coast Highway 1 to San Francisco, followed by one more farm stop at <a href=""http://pasture42.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pasture 42</a> with the family which had hosted me on my very first <a href=""http://www.wwoof.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WWOOF</a> (Worldwide Opportunities on Organic Farms) experience. After that, I will return to the bay area to reconnect with friends, ride through the famous central and southern California coast to the San Diego/Mexico border, and finally return to where my family </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">resides in Los Angeles. </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I foresee spending almost 7 million seconds, or 80 days, for this physical and mental trek of a lifetime. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Below is the (tentative, and already revised) route:</span></p>

<h2><b>My Work</b></h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>As a photographer, my own viewpoint of a particular subject matter or scenery is embedded into every image. Besides the thrill of capturing the sheer beauty of our earthly landscape at its finest moment, I am captivated by the genuine expressions in people and the human element of a scene. </span></p>
<p><span>My work has been shown or utilized on various outlets and publications, such as National Geographic's Go Blue Central America, Global Brigades, Earth Train, UC San Diego, </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">WilderUtopia, </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Escape Artist Panama, La Prensa Panama, Maptia, Visit Oceanside, and more. About a year ago, I hosted a personal photo exhibit in the historic quarters of Panama City and attracted hundreds of Panamanians and travelers on an evening where I was able to share my adventures and human experiences throughout the country. </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Past portrait sessions and weddings have taken me to an island in tropical Panama, parks throughout Los Angeles, and beaches of sunny San Diego. My cameras and I have matched alongside indigenous leaders for environmental action, witnessed the healing process at a drum circle and the traditional dances for celebration, battled water in its 3 forms from windy coasts to </span>blizzard-raged mountain peaks, <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">and frozen the unique times of the most rewarding baby smiles for his/her parents. I have a humble but steadily growing fan base through my social media networks, and aspire to inspire others to respect as well as admire the places, cultures, and beauty our world unrelentingly offers.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Beyond the photography realm, I have backpacked on multi-day journeys in the snow-peaked Sierra Nevadas, through mesmerizing sandstone canyons of Arizona and Utah, and deep into the tropical jungles of Panama. My bicycle has already racked up 1000+ miles since April, and although the road ahead will undoubtedly be filled with challenges in all </span>scenarios<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> and shapes, I am confident my strong motivations and the </span>omnipresent kindness in people will prevail and allow me to see this to completion.<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> </span></p>

Dozens of State & National Parks. 3 Cameras. 2 Wheels. 
1 Bicycling Photographer with Beautiful Pixels to Share.
As a photographer, the word ""envisioning"" is very powerful and dear to me, and I often envision a world in balance and with equality, where humans and other inhabitants live in conscious harmony. A world filled with openness, acceptance, creative art, and joy, where deeds are done out of kindness for others and respect for nature, instead of profits, and we no longer ""fight"" towards peace, but simply live in peace.
These are ideals far greater than myself, or any one individual, for that matter. It is very easy to become overwhelmed with all these tremendous global issues, and simply throw in the towel. The way I see it though, is that we ought to discover and work towards that particular thing we are most passionate about, and have faith that others will (if not already) fill the rest of the niches in a connected movement.
I do believe that global movement is underway; some of that magic has been seen by my own eyes, as well as captured with my cameras.

Skookumchuck Narrows, British Columbia. A force of nature, a scared ground for First Nations people, and an absolute sight to behold.
This is precisely the basis in which I have been transforming my own life in the past couple years. Since April this year, I left home in Los Angeles on a one-way flight with my bicycle, and have been traveling throughout the Pacific Northwest as I work from one organic farm to another and connecting with many incredible individuals along the way.

I had set out with the intentions of having low-carbon adventures, endless photographic opportunities, full immersement in sustainable food production, and 
living a minimalistic but socially and environmentally-sound lifestyle in the company of friendly strangers and old friends.
So far, so very good.




Why by Bicycle?It is a no emissions, low maintenance, and highly rewarding mode of transport. In addition these already amazing perks, traveling by bicycle also brings the pace down to be able to soak in more of the details and beauty along the way. This choice is also a personal challenge to live only with belongings I need and am able to carry - trim the fat, with nothing superfluous. The physical work comes with yet another perk, and that is the fitness and high quantity of quality food I can ingest to sustain the energy output - everyone's dream, right?


Why Organic Farms? It was through my humbling past work in environmental development work with indigenous villages in rural Panama where I became in-tune with the utmost importance of wholesome, local food production. The paradigm shift continued from taking an introduction course on the U.S. food system through the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, reading enlightening books and credible publications such as Michael Pollan's The Omnivore's Dilemma, as well as being more in-tune with world happenings. 
Late Summer Harvest at Rolling Earth Farm and Retreat, British Columbia
I came to the realization that food is in a multitude of ways the very social and environmental essence which binds and separates us from one another as well as the physical world, and found a burning desire to dive into the realms of sustainable agriculture and food systems to not only in obtaining a fuller understanding of the complexity of getting food from farm to table, but also in promoting awareness in shifting towards a system that accounts for the long-term social, public health, economical, and environmental factors over the conventional, quantity-driven, fossil fuel-based system. 
I decided one of the best ways to go about this is to get my hands dirty with the very stewards of land and farmers who have been doing it for years, and have some fun while at it!

Day-to-day operations, Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) box, and shenanigans at 8th Street Greens CSA and Farm, Okanogan, Washington

I wish to take all that I am able to absorb, and in turn, convey the significance and share such experiences through my photographs and videos I have been and will continue to post. I have also conversed with many individuals, friends and strangers alike, about the elephant in the room:
How are we going to continue to sustainably feed 7+ billion people without significantly degrading our most valuable resources of land and water?
The answer is wildly complex, hugely interdisciplinary, but certainly not without solutions with our existing knowledge and ability, as well as continued evolution.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The Journey

In the past 5 months, I have spent superbly quality time on 3 farms and intentional communities in British Columbia and Washington (Rolling Earth Farm & Retreat, Chuckleberry Community, and 8th Street Greens), met characters I will never forget, and gathered stories and experiences I would not have gained anywhere else. Some personal notes about this transformative journey can be read on my blog. Note: not a writer by any means, simply a reflective verbal spillage of thoughts ;)

Some of my many inspirational teachers

As autumn is beginning to set in, the big plan now is to take the ride of my life down the majestic west coast - from the coast of mainland British Columbia, down to Vancouver Island and towards the lush Olympic Peninsula, through the entirety of the Oregon coastline while visiting Alpha Farm, nestled in the coastal mountain ranges, for a week, then crossing the awe-inspiring Redwoods of northern California, down the Pacific Coast Highway 1 to San Francisco, followed by one more farm stop at Pasture 42 with the family which had hosted me on my very first WWOOF (Worldwide Opportunities on Organic Farms) experience. After that, I will return to the bay area to reconnect with friends, ride through the famous central and southern California coast to the San Diego/Mexico border, and finally return to where my family resides in Los Angeles. 
I foresee spending almost 7 million seconds, or 80 days, for this physical and mental trek of a lifetime. Below is the (tentative, and already revised) route:







Why Should I Contribute?

This journey has thus far been entirely self-funded, but in order to sustain this long solo trek, I need your financial and mental support! 
Your contributions will keep my stomach and body filled with wholesome calories and energy needed to sustain the 2000+ miles (3300+ km) venture across some of the most gorgeous coastline and temperature forests on our home planet.
And I will be capturing as much of that natural beauty on my cameras. So is there another incentive? You betcha! Read on...


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Photogenic Perks

In return for your contributions, a wide range of photographic/canvas prints and services are offered. The full list can be seen on the right column. A link to the full gallery of photographs to choose from will be accessible and continuously be added to soon! For now, please check out the 'Gallery' tab for just a sampler of the sceneries and moments I have captured.

Mount Rainier, Washington.


With the exception of ""The Hat Tip,"" all perks come with an invitation to a Google Hangout-style session, where I will be presenting a number of favorite photographs, moments, personal commentaries, as well as a chance to AMA - Ask Me Anything - regarding the bicycle journey, the farming experience, and of course, about photography! I plan to host several of these hangouts at the end of the year to early next year, and have several sessions to mesh well with everyone's time zones and life schedules. Details to come.

Upon arriving home to southern California, I shall call upon a trusted professional printer who uses the highest quality photo papers and canvas to materialize your beautiful print(s). 
As for the photographic services, let's work out a date in the following year, and you can expect personalized attention in making that picture-perfect portrait session happen, or wedding that you (or family/friends) have been envisioning for months, if not years. Same goes with the workshops - we will no doubt have a great time and learn much about this art that I am absolutely passionate about, wherever the location may be! 
I greatly look forward to connecting with you, and your support for my art and multitude of motivations are so, so appreciated. 





But wait, there is more!
For a number of years, I have been a huge fan of 350.org, a grassroots movement empowering people worldwide for collective global climate action and environmental awareness, and Conservacion Patagonica, which is creating the future Patagonia National Park in the incredible Andes Mountains of Chile. These good folks have been at the forefront of environmental action and stewardship for years, and your contributions to this fundraiser will also support their momentous causes. I had the great opportunity to take part in a climate action rally in Los Angeles in earlier this year, and I can tell you, the empowering feeling and great sense of community 350.org and many other organizations brought forth are the driving force we as better stewards of this planet can have more of.
As part of my belief that we are collectively doing our part in the world to make this planet a better place for all inhabitants, it is therefore my pleasure to pitch in 20% (10% each) of the net proceeds to these momentous environmental organizations. 
Check out the awesome work they are doing on their websites:

My Work


As a photographer, my own viewpoint of a particular subject matter or scenery is embedded into every image. Besides the thrill of capturing the sheer beauty of our earthly landscape at its finest moment, I am captivated by the genuine expressions in people and the human element of a scene. 
My work has been shown or utilized on various outlets and publications, such as National Geographic's Go Blue Central America, Global Brigades, Earth Train, UC San Diego, WilderUtopia, Escape Artist Panama, La Prensa Panama, Maptia, Visit Oceanside, and more. About a year ago, I hosted a personal photo exhibit in the historic quarters of Panama City and attracted hundreds of Panamanians and travelers on an evening where I was able to share my adventures and human experiences throughout the country. 
Past portrait sessions and weddings have taken me to an island in tropical Panama, parks throughout Los Angeles, and beaches of sunny San Diego. My cameras and I have matched alongside indigenous leaders for environmental action, witnessed the healing process at a drum circle and the traditional dances for celebration, battled water in its 3 forms from windy coasts to blizzard-raged mountain peaks, and frozen the unique times of the most rewarding baby smiles for his/her parents. I have a humble but steadily growing fan base through my social media networks, and aspire to inspire others to respect as well as admire the places, cultures, and beauty our world unrelentingly offers.
Beyond the photography realm, I have backpacked on multi-day journeys in the snow-peaked Sierra Nevadas, through mesmerizing sandstone canyons of Arizona and Utah, and deep into the tropical jungles of Panama. My bicycle has already racked up 1000+ miles since April, and although the road ahead will undoubtedly be filled with challenges in all scenarios and shapes, I am confident my strong motivations and the omnipresent kindness in people will prevail and allow me to see this to completion. 
Your contributions will be so valuable in perpetuating all that makes my work possible on my Facebook Photography Page, 500px profile, and blog. If you haven't already, watch the video at the top of this page to give you an essence of what this journey has been about. Check back on this fundraising page in the coming weeks to see updates!

<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><cite><u>Environmental Issues</u></cite></p>
<p><cite style=""font-weight: normal;"">Most people in the area are sustenance farmers or commercial growers of beans, oranges and pineapple and are consistently looking to expand their cultivation. Too often, once they have expanded, cleared the land, then fall into financial issues, they will walk away with the land stripped of forest. To often we can see land with old unproductive orange orchards that are not replaced, leaving the land with only one species of tree that does not support bio-diversity.</cite></p><p></p>
<p><cite style=""font-weight: normal;"">While rain-forests may seem like a distant concern, these ecosystems are critically
important for our well-being. Rain-forests are often called the lungs of the
planet for their role in absorbing carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, and
producing oxygen upon which all animals depend for survival. Rain- forests also
stabilize climate, house incredible amounts of plants and wildlife, and produce
nourishing rainfall all around the planet. </cite></p>
<p><cite><u>Our Environmental Objectives:</u></cite></p>
<ul>
<li><cite style=""font-weight: normal;"">create

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Another objective that is extremely
important in this project is; since Santa Cecilia is bordering with Nicaragua the
transportation and availability of drugs is a sad reality to young adult and
youth, and can substantially impact them in this low income area. We are

</h3></span></div>","My name is Carole Beaupre and I am from Quebec Canada. Outside has always been my favorite
place on earth, and as an educator my desire to create, teach and leave a
positive impact along the way has always been important to me. My love of the outdoors and education
is currently being shared with my business I created in Costa Rica, Cantico
Kayak and Ecotours (https://www.facebook.com/pages/CanTico-Kayaks-Eco-Tours/147781665239112) I spend my time guiding, teaching and sharing
outdoor experiences with people of all ages (in and out of the classroom). I
constantly strive to inspire people to reconnect with the outside world and to adopt a healthy lifestyle. 
My work goals in Costa Rica has been to contribute to important causes; (environmental, social), through adventure tourism, sport and education. With my four plus years of living in Costa Rica, I have fallen in love not only with the country but also with it's hard working people. 
With the skilled and experienced people I have connected with in Quebec, Canada to develop the mountain bike park project, we can clearly  achieve 

(Frederic Asselin, director of Vallee Bras du Nord, Quebec, and I. First meeting in person to discuss the Costa Rica mountain bike project. August 10-11, 2013).
positive change for the community and the people of Santa Cecilia where the project will take place starting in November 2013. 
Call it the teacher in me, I have found my true inspiration and following my passion with combining sport and education. This is what I am all about!
Our campaign’s mission is to create
a non-profit first class, sustainable mountain biking part on a Butterfly farm with 270 hectares of land in Santa Cecilia. 

www.elbosquenuevo.org
We are asking donors to be a part of this, through
supporting our mountain bike project via our: 
“Crank it up!” campaign goal of $ 50 000. In return this is
what we commit to; 

donate 100% of the mountain bike park’s profit to rain
     forest conservation and reforestation, 
support sustainable tourism for the
     community,  
support education and positive goal
     setting for the community and its youth, 

educate park users and the community on
     healthy lifestyle choices through mountain biking programs for local youth.
     The ""Crank it up!"" Campaign is seeking $50 000 dollars in
     funding to build this sustainable mountain biking park on 270 hectare of
     private land with an established project in conservation and
     reforestation. 


Why
support “Crank it up!” campaign to create El Bosque Nuevo Mountain Bike Park?
Santa
Cecilia is a beautiful and stunning area in the North West part of Costa Rica, just below Lake Nicaragua, less then 100 km form the Liberia International Airport.
The area does not yet benefit from the ten of thousands of tourists that visit Costa Rica each
year. The area has unparalleled natural beauty and terrain. It offers a
unique experience for all visitors, with its dormant and active volcanoes,
its diversity of flora and fauna, rivers and lush primary and secondary
forests.

(Riding a road around the farm with Ernesto the Director of El Bosque Nuevo. March 2013)

Environmental Issues
Most people in the area are sustenance farmers or commercial growers of beans, oranges and pineapple and are consistently looking to expand their cultivation. Too often, once they have expanded, cleared the land, then fall into financial issues, they will walk away with the land stripped of forest. To often we can see land with old unproductive orange orchards that are not replaced, leaving the land with only one species of tree that does not support bio-diversity.
While rain-forests may seem like a distant concern, these ecosystems are critically
important for our well-being. Rain-forests are often called the lungs of the
planet for their role in absorbing carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, and
producing oxygen upon which all animals depend for survival. Rain- forests also
stabilize climate, house incredible amounts of plants and wildlife, and produce
nourishing rainfall all around the planet. 
Our Environmental Objectives:

create
     a non-profit mountain bike park for tourist and local,
donate our revenue to El Bosque Nuevo Organization in order to
     contribute to their ongoing project of conservation and reforestation,
teach about environmental issues in Costa Rica and how to
     contribute. 

Social Issues
Another objective that is extremely
important in this project is; since Santa Cecilia is bordering with Nicaragua the
transportation and availability of drugs is a sad reality to young adult and
youth, and can substantially impact them in this low income area. We are
determined through education, to present other options in their life and to
facilitate and encourage a healthy and positive development in the community.
Our Social Objectives:

teach positive
     and healthy life style choices and through sports and mountain biking
     program,
facilitate
     positive goal setting in education and higher education, 
expose
     youth to different carriers through mountain biking,
develop
     necessary skills to take part in sustainable tourism,
teach
     about business,
to
     provide business opportunities around the park such as food and beverage,
     lodging, retail and service etc.

The mountain bike park will be built
on El Bosque Nuevo Butterfly Farm’s land. The farm is an established non-profit
organization owning 270 hectares of land with primary and secondary forest. The
future bike park profit will be applied 100% to the existing reforestation and
conservation project. El Bosque Nuevo’s organization started 10 years ago with
70 hectares and through selling butterflies internationally, including the
beautiful blue morpho, they are able to accumulate more land to protect and
reforest. The Montreal
 Botanical Garden is one
of their clients. The farm supports directly and indirectly 80 families.
What will we do with the funds:
This non-profit initiative is to develop a mountain bike park and sustainable practice for maintaining it.
All profit derived from the park once operational cost are used will go to El
Bosque Nuevo Butterfly farm Organization.

We're the editors of FOUND Magazine, and each summer for the past 9 years – with the generous help of friends like you – we put together a camping trip called Washington to Washington, where we bring kids who have grown up in the city to experience the Great Outdoors. Thank you so much for checking out the short video above, and contributing what you can to help this year's trip come to life!Washington to Washington is an annual outdoors adventure bringing kids from Washington, D.C., Southeast Michigan (Detroit area), and New Orleans on a week-long camping and hiking trip to explore some of the country's most incredible wilderness areas. Along the way, these kids will hike up a mountain, walk through beautiful forests, see animals they didn't know existed, swim, canoe, and fish in pristine lakes and rivers, eat new foods, ride horses, watch the Perseid meteor shower, make S’mores and tell ghost stories around a campfire, learn camping and wilderness skills, and basically just have fun!What have we done on previous W2W trips? We've hiked some of the tallest mountains in America at the Presidential Range in New Hampshire (2010); dropped by Luray Caverns and found secret swimming holes deep into the Shenandoah Valley (2011); found crawfish in the creek, tried some yoga, and hiked up Seneca Rocks in West Virginia (2012); drifted down a lazy river and explored Tracy Ridge in Allegheny National Forest (2013); completed a scavenger hunt, hit the beach, and hiked Bolar Mountain in George Washington National Forest (2014); went to a children's museum, played a pick-up game in Michigan Stadium, canoed tranquil lakes, and played in the sand around Warren Dunes in Michigan (2015); zip-lined, pet wild ponies, and trekked Mount Rogers in Virginia (2016); fished a nearby lake, rode on horseback, and hiked around Lake Sherando, Virginia (2017); and, last year, spent our ride tickets at the state fair, fished a little more, competed in camp Olympics, and hiked Twin Overlook in Virginia (2018).For this year's trip – the 10th annual trip – we're heading to the jaw-droppingly gorgeous Sleeping Bear Dunes in northern Michigan and hiking the stunning Empire Dunes! Forests, sand dunes, and lakeshore beaches, all in one place! While we won't have to dodge bears and bulls like years past, we're looking forward to seeing deer, foxes, porcupines, and even bald eagles.The trip was inspired by our friendship with D.C. native Emmanuel Durant, Jr. After his tragic death on New Year's Eve, 2009, we teamed up with Emmanuel's family to create these annual trips as a way to introduce city kids to the magic of nature, broaden perspectives, and pay tribute to Emmanuel.What We Need & What You GetWe have 55 wonderful, deserving kids who are excited to go on the trip this summer (the farthest in W2W history – over 800 miles from D.C.!), but we would love to raise $30,000 by August 8th in order to make the trip happen. Thanks to some extremely generous donors, we were able to raise over $12,000 this spring to give us a head start; now, we're in the home stretch for the final $18,000. Our trips are run entirely by volunteers, so please know that 100% of your donation goes toward covering the hard costs of making the trip happen — food, gas, transportation, camping gear, etc.Honestly, the biggest reward you'll receive from contributing is the knowledge that you've helped some awesome kids get out into nature — many for the first time in their lives — and have some new, life-enriching experiences. That said, we'll also be sending out photos of the trip, handmade Thank You cards, and all kinds of other special prizes to those who offer support. Check out the full range of Perks listed to the right.  Have a special Perks request that we didn't include?  Don't hesitate to email us and ask!The ImpactOur trips have no specific agenda — we seek only to introduce kids who have rarely left D.C., Detroit and New Orleans (or even their own neighborhoods) to the joys of nature and wilderness hiking and give them a chance to experience something brand-new and have an exciting adventure.  On past Washington to Washington hikes, we trip leaders have seen that look of accomplishment and inspiration that fills the kids' faces when we've reached the top of a mountain.  It's amazing! You can check out photo galleries of our 2011 - 2018 trips to get a sense for just how special our Washington to Washington trips seem to be to these kids. And, here's a short, lovely video featuring camper David on his first trip in 2014 (he's a camper who has returned every year since).Other Ways You Can HelpBesides contributing financially, there are other ways that you can help us make our 10th Annual Washington to Washington trip a reality:- Email links to this IndieGoGo fundraising page and our Washington to Washington website to your family and friends.

<h1>WHAT DO CAT SOUNDS MEAN</h1>
<p>Cats can make more than 100 vocal sounds. </p>
<ul>
<li>Chirps and
     trills are how a mother cat tells her kittens to follow her. Aimed at you,
     it probably means your cat wants you to follow him, usually to his food
     bowl. If you have more than one cat, you'll often hear them converse with
     each other this way. Purring is a sign of contentment (usually). </li>
<li>Cats purr
     whenever they're happy, even while they’re eating. Sometimes, however, a
     cat may purr when she's anxious or sick, using her purr to comfort
     herself, like a child sucking his thumb. </li>
<li>Growling,
     hissing or spitting indicate a cat who is annoyed, frightened, angry or
     aggressive. Leave this cat alone. </li>
<li>A yowl or
     howl (they sound like loud, drawn-out meows) tells you your cat is in some
     kind of distress—stuck in a closet, looking for you or in pain. Find your
     cat if he's making this noise. However, in unneutered and unspayed cats,
     these sounds are part of mating behavior (and very annoying). And if your
     cat is elderly, he may be suffering from a cognitive disorder (dementia)
     and may howl because he's disoriented. </li>
<li>Chattering,
     chittering or twittering are the noises your cat makes when she's sitting
     in the window watching birds or squirrels. Some experts think that this is
     an exaggeration of the ""killing bite,"" when a cat grabs her prey
     by the neck and works her teeth through the bones to snap them. </li>

Our latest effort is our switch to single- stream recycling across our entire 700+ acre campus. Additionally, we are hoping to build a 3-bin compost system which will not only reduce our waste and reuse it in a way that betters the environment, but will also function as a core component of our educational and camp programming going forward. To complete our efforts we are turning to our Incarnation and Bushy Hill Nature Center families for help! In order to properly institute single-stream recycling we need to purchase indoor and outdoor bins for our property. We will purchase 15 indoor bins with lids and 9 outdoor bins with lids to make it easier for our guests, campers and visitors to properly recycle! The indoor bins (23 gallons) with lids are $70.00 each and the outdoor bins (32 gallons) with lids are $52.00 each. Together, the bins cost $1,572. Here is what they look like:                   Indoor Bins:                                          Outdoor Bins:                                      We will place the indoor recycling bins in the following buildings: the Welcome Center, the Lodge, Brooks Cottage, Bell Cottage, Katsanis, Lakeside, St. James, Arts and Crafts and T.I. (Tumble Inn). Our outdoor bins will be placed at Gibney Dining Hall, the Lodge kitchen, Katsanis field, AC field and the waterfront. Bushy Hill Nature Center will also be receiving a full compliment of bins, as part of a project launched by one of our summer staff members who is working toward her Gold Star Girl Scout award.In order to build our 3-bin compost system, we need to raise money for the building materials (wood, wiring, cinder blocks).

We estimate that building our 3-bin compost system will cost us about $1,500. Switching to Single-Stream Recycling and composting our waste will help us become better caretakers of the earth, as well as promote life-long practices of environmental stewardship to campers and guests that consider Incarnation and Bushy Hill Nature Center a second home.  We ask you to support us in our efforts to be greener by contributing what you can.

However we prefer the term “<i>minimal-waste</i>” since there is always some waste produced in the supply chain, even if it is a paper bag. Our goal is to develop a closed-loop circular system managing all waste produced directly and indirectly by our business activities, and repurposing it for future use. </p><p>As a specialty grocery store with a focus on ethical consumerism, we purchase healthy natural products in bulk from organic wholesale suppliers and in small quantities from local food producers who can accommodate our packaging needs and meet our quality standards. We then offer these products for sale without packaging or with minimal packaging if required.</p><p>Eliminating plastic from our supply chain is something we work tirelessly towards. As of now, about 87% of our products are delivered to us plastic-free: in paper, cardboard or certified compostable packaging. The range of organic food ingredients grown and produced locally is relatively small. Many common food ingredients are imported, processed, repackaged and then branded for sale. Little Plant Pantry skips most of these steps by purchasing unprocessed ingredients in their original packaging (usually 25kg paper bags for dry goods) and sells them unpackaged, allowing customers to refill their own containers.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607625906/by2qqnf0fgffiftfp1wm.png"" src=""""/></p><p>In line with our goals of supporting local communities, investing in sustainable agriculture and reducing our carbon-footprint, we aspire to cooperate with local organic food producers as much as possible. We believe that only by working together can we change existing production and distribution practices that are partially responsible for the current environmental crisis. </p><p>Our store in Amsterdam Oud West has been very well received by the community. We are not a corporation but a small company that has been self-financed and maintained by two people and a number of dedicated volunteers. Yet, we are proving to be a viable and practical alternative to the supermarket chains.
