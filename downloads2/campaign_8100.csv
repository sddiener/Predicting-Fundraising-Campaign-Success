</h3> <p>My name is LC Morgan. I am a 21 year old artist aspiring to work my way to Ontario College of Art and Design (OCADU), in Toronto, Canada. I plan to major in Illustration, to achieve my dreams of being a storyboard artist for TV/Film, a portrait artist, and a comic book illustrator. Please feel free to check out my more popular artwork thus far on my website: <a href=""http://lcmorganart.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.lcmorganart.com</a><a href=""http://www.lcmorganart.com."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">.</a> Or click my gallery at the top of the page.<br/></p>
<p>However, my parents' recent divorce has left one parent unable to help support me financially, and one parent unwilling to support my higher education. I have done a lot of freelance artwork in the past two years, as well as creating a commission business to save money for school, but I am still short on funds.</p>
<p>If you ask about an artist from my home town, 9/10 people will know my 
name. I am a self-taught artist, and have been drawing and writing my own comics since I was 9 years old. By my calculations, I have spent nearly 13,000 hours of my life drawing. On social media, I have a collective 3,000+ fans, followers, and likes.</p>
<p>I am a very accomplished artist for my age: having done artwork 
for a dozen Olympic Athletes directly, having my artwork recognized by a handful of celebrities, and been promoted multiple times by BBC America for my fan artwork of 'Orphan Black'.<br/></p>
<p>There is nothing I want and need more in my life than to have a chance to go to university. I know that I will succeed in any artistic setting - I just need the chance.</p>
<p>Every contributor to my cause will receive artwork from me. I am willing to draw anything in exchange for your support. Working for my opportunity to go to school is incredibly important to me. You can contact me at lcmorganart@gmail.com.</p>

<p><span>One day during my middle school art class, my teacher told the young artists in the room, “The hardest thing for any artist to do, young or old, is find that one thing that helps them stand out among the rest.” I was in my 30s when I realized just how true that statement was.

<p>These two desires merged by accident in July of 2015.

<p><b>Abood Aladham</b></p>
<p>Abood is the founder of the very first beatbox battle in
Jordan. After falling in love with beatbox in 2010, Abood taught himself how to
practice the art, but found no space to hone his skills or meet and compete
with other beatboxers. So he decided to create the King of the Beat in 2014
which brought together all the active beatboxers of Jordan in one competition.
The event was a success and Abood found that he had united a large beatbox
community in one space.</p>
<p>Abood, at just 22 years of age, is already an accomplished
and talented beatboxer who has done numerous shows around the country, appeared
on TV and radio shows, and has his own fan base. He is well known in Amman’s
Hip Hop underground and the city’s wider arts scene. Abood is also an active
member in the arts scene as part of Studio 8, an arts and dance collective. </p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457898885/oz7roubi5ddqkhfrumaf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>While the King of the Beat and Beatbox Unlimited
competitions have been popular and successful, they have relied on the goodwill
and generosity of the people who made the event happen. Reputable artists have
kindly offered to judge, MC, perform and support in a variety of ways for free.
Although this is a show of support from the Hip Hop scene, it does little to
remedy the lack of financial support and sponsorship given to artists. </p>
<p>Too many events, festivals and activities in Jordan expect
grassroots artists to perform and work for very little money to no pay at all –
while they pay astonishing amounts of money to import artists from outside! Abood
wants to change this and run a competition where local talent is paid for their
art. He has started to make this change within his own community of beatboxers.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457899019/q3wy7ky1olqpwqj7wltl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p><b>Changing social views of beatboxing</b></p>
<p>While Hip Hop is moderately frowned upon in Jordan, things are
far worse for Beatboxers. Often places which host shows and events will draw
the line at beatboxing, excluding an entire community of youth with dedication
and promising talent and depriving them of opportunities to develop their art. </p>
<p>The exclusion is worse for female beatboxers. Not only is
the beatbox community male dominated, but traditional Jordanian society
considers it shameful for young girls to perform on stage. This is something
the King of the Beat is actively trying to change. Abood Aladham has gone to
extraordinary lengths to mentor and support the first and only female Jordanian
beatboxer Sara, in spite of family opposition. Sara competed in the King of the
Beat 2015 and gave her first ever solo performance during Beatbox Unlimited, an
event that incorporated musicians, dancers, and other performers into
beatboxing performances. Originally, Sara had a teammate to compete in Beatbox
Unlimited, a young female vocalist. However the girl was removed from the event
by her family who considered the event “vulgar” and “beneath them”. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457898975/opeosdcmhop53o7pecip.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>Instead of disqualifying Sara, Abood featured Sara in a
special beatbox solo performance. This campaign is not only about showcasing
beatboxers, but also about changing how society views the art and its
artists.  </p>
<p>It is Abood’s belief that beatbox and the performing arts in
general give people an outlet for self-expression and self-discovery. They also
encourage creative and critical thinking. Beatboxing in particular requires
discipline and hours of practice which can be done independently or with
others. </p>
<p>There are many beatboxers across Jordan, many of whom have
never interacted with others in their art form. Beatboxers are largely
self-taught, which makes them extremely creative and shows their dedication to
the art. The King of the Beat supports and mobilizes the beatboxing community
in Jordan, allowing them to gain more exposure to an international beatbox
scene while simultaneously changing social views of beatbox and widening young

Abood Aladham
Abood is the founder of the very first beatbox battle in
Jordan. After falling in love with beatbox in 2010, Abood taught himself how to
practice the art, but found no space to hone his skills or meet and compete
with other beatboxers. So he decided to create the King of the Beat in 2014
which brought together all the active beatboxers of Jordan in one competition.
The event was a success and Abood found that he had united a large beatbox
community in one space.
Abood, at just 22 years of age, is already an accomplished
and talented beatboxer who has done numerous shows around the country, appeared
on TV and radio shows, and has his own fan base. He is well known in Amman’s
Hip Hop underground and the city’s wider arts scene. Abood is also an active
member in the arts scene as part of Studio 8, an arts and dance collective. 

While the King of the Beat and Beatbox Unlimited
competitions have been popular and successful, they have relied on the goodwill
and generosity of the people who made the event happen. Reputable artists have
kindly offered to judge, MC, perform and support in a variety of ways for free.
Although this is a show of support from the Hip Hop scene, it does little to
remedy the lack of financial support and sponsorship given to artists. 
Too many events, festivals and activities in Jordan expect
grassroots artists to perform and work for very little money to no pay at all –
while they pay astonishing amounts of money to import artists from outside! Abood
wants to change this and run a competition where local talent is paid for their
art. He has started to make this change within his own community of beatboxers.
Changing social views of beatboxing
While Hip Hop is moderately frowned upon in Jordan, things are
far worse for Beatboxers. Often places which host shows and events will draw
the line at beatboxing, excluding an entire community of youth with dedication
and promising talent and depriving them of opportunities to develop their art. 
The exclusion is worse for female beatboxers. Not only is
the beatbox community male dominated, but traditional Jordanian society
considers it shameful for young girls to perform on stage. This is something
the King of the Beat is actively trying to change. Abood Aladham has gone to
extraordinary lengths to mentor and support the first and only female Jordanian
beatboxer Sara, in spite of family opposition. Sara competed in the King of the
Beat 2015 and gave her first ever solo performance during Beatbox Unlimited, an
event that incorporated musicians, dancers, and other performers into
beatboxing performances. Originally, Sara had a teammate to compete in Beatbox
Unlimited, a young female vocalist. However the girl was removed from the event
by her family who considered the event “vulgar” and “beneath them”. 
Instead of disqualifying Sara, Abood featured Sara in a
special beatbox solo performance. This campaign is not only about showcasing
beatboxers, but also about changing how society views the art and its
artists.  
It is Abood’s belief that beatbox and the performing arts in
general give people an outlet for self-expression and self-discovery. They also
encourage creative and critical thinking. Beatboxing in particular requires
discipline and hours of practice which can be done independently or with
others. 
There are many beatboxers across Jordan, many of whom have
never interacted with others in their art form. Beatboxers are largely
self-taught, which makes them extremely creative and shows their dedication to
the art. The King of the Beat supports and mobilizes the beatboxing community
in Jordan, allowing them to gain more exposure to an international beatbox
scene while simultaneously changing social views of beatbox and widening young
artists’ horizons.
The mission behind the King of the Beat is to empower the
beatboxing community in Jordan and provide them with more artistic
opportunities on stage in Jordan and gain exposure to the international beatbox
scene. We hope in doing so, we can change social views of beatbox and widen
young artists’ horizons. 
Over the past three years, through his work for the beatbox
community, Abood Aladham has:
Provided spaces for young beatboxers to gather, practice and
learn new skills, such as in our affiliate Studio 8
Arranged the only Beatbox workshops available in

Second Helpings is a group visual art exhibition, a “fatinee” of multidisciplinary performance, and a queer intervention into American popular culture’s understanding of the fat body as a deviant body. Exhibiting artists fight the stigmatization of fat bodies, radically re-envision the notion of body diversity, and destabilize deeply embedded hierarchies of desire.Second Helpings features works in many media by 20+ visual artists, and 8 solo and ensemble performances. Selected works deconstruct and reassess body politics to foster a collective understanding of fatness that empowers and heals fat-bodied people emotionally, sexually and politically.A new theatrical work humorously addresses the correlation between body shame and cultural imperialism. A 5-piece band named after pastries snacks ritualistically onstage. A debut video work explores racialized and gendered experiences of fat-phobia. A chubby drag queen pushes back on the ways her body is treated as a dystopian object of desire. Come ravenous. Help yourself.
WHAT DOES SECOND HELPINGS NEED? Alex Pizzacake & Fallon Young received $1,000 from the Queer Cultural Center to begin to realize Second Helpings. From this modest budget, $800 in commissions were awarded to 13 participating artists to support the production of new work. Scrappiness, appeals for in-kind donations, and other creative solutions ensued, but we still need to pay for installation supplies, venue & technical costs, and financially support the work of the remaining uncommissioned artists, and we can’t do it without your help. 
Here is how our $1,800 fundraising goal breaks down:

At $200 we will have covered Alex & Fallon’s out of pocket costs for Second Helpings
At $600 we will be able to award $50 commissions to (8) participating artists who have not yet received any assistance to offset the cost of things like printing, framing, costumes and other materials
At $1,800 we will be able to double the support individual artists receive to participate in Second Helpings. This is still a modest amount (no artist would receive more than $200) but would be meaningful to these artists who are spending their own time and resources to make this work! 
Any additional funds we raise beyond $1,800 will be shared among the artists
For total transparency, here is our budget:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmQfgGrFZQcGdDF1X1U4eFFsWnZBZUpIblg5cUFGRlE&usp=sharingQuestions? Email us at secondhelpingsshow [at] gmail.com.Your support will help us pay our artists. With our small budget, we are paying our artists a fraction of what their meaningful and necessary works deserve. Help us increase those commissions. WHO IS IN SECOND HELPINGS?

<h2>Help Stefie help!</h2>
<p>This fundraiser campaign is set to help me raise the funds required for my placement on a volunteer program with <a href=""http://www.globalvolunteernetwork.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">GVN</a> in Guatemala, July 2014. There will be two types of contributions available:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Commission Art:</i> By selecting the tier of choice, you can get an original piece of artwork from me of whatever* you ask me to draw! Of course, the artwork characteristics are limited per tier, so read carefully when donating so you can get the best out of your contribution.</li>
<li>
<i>Selfless Donation:</i> This tier is for those of you who are kind enough to contribute to this cause without wanting anything in return. By selecting this tier, you will contribute USD$10 out of the pure goodness of your heart! Please keep in mind there is no artwork compensation a selfless donation.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>*Please keep in mind that I won't be doing any lewd drawings. That means I won't be drawing naked men/women/animals/fantasy creatures in sexual (or suggestive) situations.</i></p>
<p>I encourage you to visit the <a href=""http://www.globalvolunteernetwork.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">GVN</a> website for more information on the volunteering programs they offer. The actual total cost of the fee to keep me working a full month in Guatemala is of USD$2,447, but I'll be attempting to raise just part of the fee due to the number of drawings I'll be limited to complete in two months.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2><a href=""http://www.globalvolunteernetwork.org/about/costs.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b>Why does it cost to volunteer?</b></a></h2>
<blockquote>
<a href=""http://www.globalvolunteernetwork.org/about/costs.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b><br/></b></a>Paying to volunteer can seem a strange concept. Why should someone charge you to work for free? But this is a common misconception about international volunteer placements —the volunteer work is not what you are paying for. So what is the program package going towards?</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<br/>Firstly, we want you to know that the Global Volunteer Network is a registered Charitable Trust in New Zealand (Reg # CC46460). This means that we are a non-profit organization and we exist simply to fulfill our mission of connecting volunteers with communities in need with a special focus on vulnerable women and children.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<br/>GVN's volunteer programs are based in developing countries within poverty-stricken communities. We partner with local grass-roots organizations who are working hard to make a difference in their community/environment where the majority of people do not have the funds to adequately feed their families, afford health care, or send their children to school. The communities themselves are in need of infrastructure and support and do not have the ability to cover the costs for the much needed assistance a volunteer provides. Our long term aim is for the communities/projects we support to become sustainable and self-sufficient.</blockquote>
<p><br/></p>

This fundraiser campaign is set to help me raise the funds required for my placement on a volunteer program with GVN in Guatemala, July 2014. There will be two types of contributions available:


Commission Art: By selecting the tier of choice, you can get an original piece of artwork from me of whatever* you ask me to draw! Of course, the artwork characteristics are limited per tier, so read carefully when donating so you can get the best out of your contribution.

Selfless Donation: This tier is for those of you who are kind enough to contribute to this cause without wanting anything in return. By selecting this tier, you will contribute USD$10 out of the pure goodness of your heart! Please keep in mind there is no artwork compensation a selfless donation.

*Please keep in mind that I won't be doing any lewd drawings. That means I won't be drawing naked men/women/animals/fantasy creatures in sexual (or suggestive) situations.
I encourage you to visit the GVN website for more information on the volunteering programs they offer. The actual total cost of the fee to keep me working a full month in Guatemala is of USD$2,447, but I'll be attempting to raise just part of the fee due to the number of drawings I'll be limited to complete in two months.

Why does it cost to volunteer?

Paying to volunteer can seem a strange concept. Why should someone charge you to work for free? But this is a common misconception about international volunteer placements —the volunteer work is not what you are paying for. So what is the program package going towards?

Firstly, we want you to know that the Global Volunteer Network is a registered Charitable Trust in New Zealand (Reg # CC46460). This means that we are a non-profit organization and we exist simply to fulfill our mission of connecting volunteers with communities in need with a special focus on vulnerable women and children.

GVN's volunteer programs are based in developing countries within poverty-stricken communities. We partner with local grass-roots organizations who are working hard to make a difference in their community/environment where the majority of people do not have the funds to adequately feed their families, afford health care, or send their children to school. The communities themselves are in need of infrastructure and support and do not have the ability to cover the costs for the much needed assistance a volunteer provides. Our long term aim is for the communities/projects we support to become sustainable and self-sufficient.

<p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p>Over the past 10 years I have been working and educating
myself in the art, fashion, photography, and music fields. In 2010, I moved to
China for one year. During that time, I met Peter, a gallery owner and art
enthusiast. He introduced me to an art community that I am still in touch with
to this day. 5 + 5 is a show that Peter and I have been curating together for
the past 9 months. We are showing 5 Beijing artists and 5 New York artists. The
show opens at 5:05PM on November 8<sup>th</sup>, 2013 at the Under Heaven
Contemporary Art Museum in Songzhuang, China. The show will be open for 10 days
following. After the show closes, I will be traveling with Peter to Nanjing to
discuss and present a plan for an Art Village that is on track to be developed
within 3 years. This Art Village will provide studios, galleries, and
apartments for artists to take residencies within China. </p>
<p><b>Funding</b></p>
<p>With all the creative projects I’ve had the opportunity to
be a part of, I have always been self funded or hired. 5 + 5 is the largest
financial responsibility I’ve had for a self-funded show. My current job in New
York has essentially let me know that in order to prepare for me being gone for
a month, they will be phasing me out over the coming weeks. If I am not there,
I do not make money. Therefore I am at risk of falling short of my financial
goal.</p>
<p>In order to complete my responsibility for the show, I am
requesting $3000. This money will be split in two ways: </p>
<p><i>5 + 5 : </i>Remaining show costs including press materials,
surround sound speaker installation, projector screen, etc. that if my work
does nothing unordinary will be fine however there is a high risk involved
assuming that. </p>
<p><i>Art Village :</i> Putting together a full presentation,
transportation to the meetings, lodging in the town, etc. The meetings that
take place during the days following the show will set the stage for the
project over the next 3 years. </p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>Any money you contribute to this goes directly to supporting
an open channel of art starting with two cities and expanding as we go. My
intention is to have art available for everyone. And for me, that starts with
this show. </p>

Thank you for your participation in this project. I appreciate the support you can give. It really means the world to me. <p>Alexandra Loulias</p>

<p>Dear Brothers and Sisters, My name is Jonatan Lopez, a Houston based interdisciplinary artist and one of the facilitators of Houston's Performance Art Group ""Continuum"". I am  honored to be part of ""Lone Star Performance Explosion,""  the first International Performance Art Biennale in Houston. Since I am donating my stipend to the artists coming from out of town, I find myself in need to independently raise through this campaign a modest stipend to finance my performance. These funds will be used to  acquire edible chocolate products to be integrated in creative ways during my performance.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My performance piece entitled ""Brown,"" a performance about race and consumerism,  will go down in history as the most frivolous demonstration of freedom in the history of our nation. It will involve public guerrilla  style performances prior to the event and lots of chocolate during the 10 minute stage performance.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>150 dollars will be enough to get all the chocolate I need for this performance, but if you feel the generous impulse to add more, that would help to give a stipend to the 5 performance artists helping me perform this piece.  Please check out the fabulous perks , appropriately related to the theme of  this performance, that you can acquire in exchange for your generosity.</div>

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">my name is Shay Kuebler and I've been an independent dancer, performer and choreographer in Vancouver for the past 8 years. I come from a background in martial arts and theatre, which lead to a diverse background in dance. My performance works reflect a theatrical sensibility and raw physicality, which is formed around projection, live sound, interactive technology and other elements. All in attempts to bring the viewer further into the experience and purpose of the performance work. Currently, my creative work is beginning to reach out of the local community and tour nationally and internationally. The infrastructure I have in place as an individual artist is not able to maintain the growth of my work, so I'm now at the beginning stages of opening an arts society to further support my work. With the genesis of the arts society, I will be able to expand my art form and develop what I'm creating further, but I need your assistance with the initial growth of this company.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I have great belief in my work and its ability to reach diverse audiences. I've witnessed this through the success of touring and performing over the past 6 years, and believe that I'm creating unique work that is not only integral to my artistry but is accessible and is creating a larger audience for dance and physical performance. I strive to make a theatre experience that is captivating, enriching and stimulates your own instigation towards creativity and what makes you passionate. I thank you for your time in reading these words and checking out the video. Throw this out on facebook, instagram, banagrams, youtube or on paper.

Blending multiple genres of art, the society pushes the boundaries of physical performance and is constantly researching and redeveloping its artistic form to reach new audiences and further engage followers to physical performance. Through continued research, intensive training and discovery, the society focuses strength on expansion, education, public appreciation and collaboration with new methodologies and ideologies. Believing that all techniques and practices, when used in an instinctive manner, can reinforce each other and create a greater potential in the art of physical performance. The goal of the company is to create a visceral, risk-taking physicality and give it precision, detail and structure. Balancing the raw and unstructured with the precise and exact, then focusing these accelerated and ambitious forms with a theatrical sensibility. Creating a greater capacity to experiment and delve into the furthest edges of choreographic innovation and physical performance.</span></p>

With this early development, he has developed a multi-disciplinary background in martial forms, dance techniques, music and theatre. Shay has been an independent dance artist in the city of Vancouver and Montreal for the past 8 years. Along with his successes as a collaborator and co-director, he has had the honor of performing and creating his own work for Canadian and international arts festivals and dance companies. With a foundation in the martial arts, he is constantly searching for how physical performance can be finely tuned yet retain an instinctual and raw quality. As a dance artist, whose professional performing and choreographic career has spanned the disciplines of  tap, hip hop, neo-classical ballet and contemporary dance, Shay also looks at how all techniques can reinforce and strengthen each other. That technique, when used in an instinctive manner, can be integrated into any other form of art.

Shay Kuebler was born and raised in Sherwood Park, Alberta, Shay's foundation in arts began with Martial Arts and Theatre at the age of 5. With this early development, he has developed a multi-disciplinary background in martial forms, dance techniques, music and theatre. Shay has been an independent dance artist in the city of Vancouver and Montreal for the past 8 years. Along with his successes as a collaborator and co-director, he has had the honor of performing and creating his own work for Canadian and international arts festivals and dance companies. With a foundation in the martial arts, he is constantly searching for how physical performance can be finely tuned yet retain an instinctual and raw quality. As a dance artist, whose professional performing and choreographic career has spanned the disciplines of  tap, hip hop, neo-classical ballet and contemporary dance, Shay also looks at how all techniques can reinforce and strengthen each other. That technique, when used in an instinctive manner, can be integrated into any other form of art. Creating cross-disciplinary works that create a greater potential and capacity for each form. The society will be aiming to gain sponsorship from a charitable organization and will look to offer charitable tax receipts upon request.

<p>Four seasons ago, we opened the Café doors because there was no other city venue where folks could <em>hear</em> spokenword or acoustic music. Every other venue was simply a watering hole where artists were the background noise for raucous voices and clinking glasses.</p>
<p>TRIAAC wanted to change that. We know that artists have critical messages for us, and we wanted them to be heard. So we opened our doors on faith that the community would come to a venue where art was the real focus. We were right! Featuring seasoned artists, new talent, an Open Mic at each Café, and a $5 admission charge, we've grown from an average 15 patrons two years ago, to 35 at the end of our third season. We'll grow that average to 50 in a house that seats 65 by the end of our fourth season.</p>

<h3><strong>How you can help</strong></h3>
<p>With a small grant from our local Arts agency last year, we were able to give artists a small stipend in appreciation and support of their work. That grant is no more and to continue to grow we now need your help!</p>
<p>By the end of September we must raise $7500 to cover the season’s artist stipends, operational costs and promotions. $4900 of that will go to artist fees. Another $1200 will go to advertising and promotions, and operations and supplies will consume the $1400 balance.</p>

<h3>Why Do I (And All Artists) Need Financial Support?</h3>
<p>It is not easy surviving as a full time artist. Very few make it a full time profession, and most of those are often <a href=""https://www.vox.com/first-person/2018/11/12/18057130/money-income-inequality-basic-income-generational-wealth"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">subsidized</a> from personal wealth. Americans are acclimated to both painfully low wages and cheap consumer goods, so we have limited options for a collecting public. Additionally, other arts funding is more scarce, and directed at work that has the least chance of commercial viability. Essentially, making weird objects that are both functional and labeled ""jewelry"", but which are challenging in many ways, makes life hard for all of us art jewelry makers.</p>
<p>I've spent the last seven years trying different fairs in different locations hoping to hone in on who, exactly, my work is most appealing to. Last year, bolstered by the volume of work I've been producing, I tried to juggle multiple fairs on a schedule that I know many other artists manage well, or even exceed. Though I met many amazing people, and I'm glad I got to share the work in person as it always makes for a deeper connection, the end result left me in rough shape. Overall, I'm always the weird kid at fairs, and it is a very draining experience. I pushed myself too hard trying to off-set the expenses, juggled workshops to subsidize, did a very bad job at taking care of myself, and still ended up in the red and worse for wear physically. I want to make this exhibition work, but I don't want to spend the rest of 2019 wondering how to survive because of it. Any help with this is deeply appreciated!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know a lot of you reading this are artists/makers as I am. I wouldn't have made it this far without the support of other artists. However, I know that means many of you are in the same place I am: trying to sustain a creative life on slim margins. If you can't support me right now, I understand. There have been times when I had extra money to help a friend's project, and there have been times when I had nothing to spare. Just help me share this, get the word out, and if you're coming to Munich in March, please come by and say hello!</p>
<p>/</p>
<h3>More Info About My Work/This Series</h3>
</div><p>Polyphonous: animal/vegetable/mineral</p><p>My work has always been a blending of organic forms, with the intention of creating wearable objects that seem both familiar and uncanny. I've looked to both the zoological and botanical world for structures, systems, and patterns that I can repurpose and filter through abstraction. More recently I've been playing with implausibility, looking for colors and patterns that would help further eschew recognizability, and reveling in strangeness. At the same time, I've also been ruminating much more on transgression and how the natural world can sometimes defy easy reduction and categorization. There is a direct link in my productivity and risk taking in the studio to my rage, heightened anxiety, and rebellion against the rise of bigotry in the US. Coupled with the desire to amplify the ambiguity, peculiarity, and otherworldly qualities in my work, references to non-biological forms have become very interesting to me, and I find myself now exploring alien territory. This current body of work that is becoming animal/vegetable/mineral is much more overtly about defiance, and in particular, taking the form of objects that are exhuberantly, confrontationally weird.</p></div>","Iowa to Munich

I'm a full time artist based in Iowa City, IA.
I've spent the last couple of years evolving toward new work loosely under the banner of ""animal/vegetable/mineral""
Munich Jewellery Week is the largest international venue for contemporary jewelry.
Getting to share this new work with the international community at MJW is very exciting!
The shop I will be exhibiting in, Louloute, will offer a unique setting to create an installation for this work.

I'm Broke, but I Can't Miss This Opportunity

Lodging at Pension Belo Sono for $378.98 for March 11-18. This location is ideal not just because of the price, but because it is on Gollierstraße, right across from Louloute!
There is a rental fee for the venue  of about 350€ (excl. VAT) which will be between $450 and $500 (US) depending upon where exchange rates are by the time I get there.
The travel costs to Munich are about $1100, with the potential for luggage fees given all that I need to bring with me.
I would like to live on more than peanut butter for the week if possible.
Having done a fundraiser before, I've learned that it isn't so smart to make the perks overlap with the work of the project. This time I'm fully embracing the potential of swag, and with the help of Ben Smasher, we will be producing a variety of merchandise with peculiar images generated from this work.
These funds will go toward keeping me from digging myself even deeper in credit card debt!

Overall, I'm always the weird kid at fairs, and it is a very draining experience. I pushed myself too hard trying to off-set the expenses, juggled workshops to subsidize, did a very bad job at taking care of myself, and still ended up in the red and worse for wear physically. I want to make this exhibition work, but I don't want to spend the rest of 2019 wondering how to survive because of it. Any help with this is deeply appreciated!

Other Ways You Can Help
I know a lot of you reading this are artists/makers as I am. I wouldn't have made it this far without the support of other artists. However, I know that means many of you are in the same place I am: trying to sustain a creative life on slim margins. If you can't support me right now, I understand. There have been times when I had extra money to help a friend's project, and there have been times when I had nothing to spare. Just help me share this, get the word out, and if you're coming to Munich in March, please come by and say hello!

More Info About My Work/This Series
Polyphonous: animal/vegetable/mineralMy work has always been a blending of organic forms, with the intention of creating wearable objects that seem both familiar and uncanny. I've looked to both the zoological and botanical world for structures, systems, and patterns that I can repurpose and filter through abstraction. More recently I've been playing with implausibility, looking for colors and patterns that would help further eschew recognizability, and reveling in strangeness. At the same time, I've also been ruminating much more on transgression and how the natural world can sometimes defy easy reduction and categorization. There is a direct link in my productivity and risk taking in the studio to my rage, heightened anxiety, and rebellion against the rise of bigotry in the US. Coupled with the desire to amplify the ambiguity, peculiarity, and otherworldly qualities in my work, references to non-biological forms have become very interesting to me, and I find myself now exploring alien territory. This current body of work that is becoming animal/vegetable/mineral is much more overtly about defiance, and in particular, taking the form of objects that are exhuberantly, confrontationally weird.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/153983/files/20131025045639-xyz.png?1382702199"" src="""" style=""""/></i></p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Yogesh, a young artist from the small Indian Village has a rare gift. He is
one of those few artists who can transform a piece of glass into anything he
wish – birds, fishes, animals, fruits, trees and even humans hunting in the
wild. Anything and everything that he can imagine can be sculpted from the
molten glass.</span><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>And he does it without
electricity, moulds, dies or any special equipment whatsoever. Just a kerosene
burner flame, glass rod, broken pieces of colored glass bangles and ordinary
home tools. </p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Even the compressor required to
regulate the flame intensity is pedal operated and designed and custom built
entirely from cardboard. Isn't that amazing?</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/153957/files/20131025041014-artist_intro1.jpg?1382699414"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/></span><p></p>
<p>The process, known as Hot Glass
Sculpting, is deceptively simple.The
glass crystals are softened into viscous fluid by directly inserting in the
flame and then given the desired shape and colors before it cools down. That is
it....no rocket science.</p>
<p>But as said, the simplicity is
misleading. Transforming the glass crystals into a colorful sculpture with
perfect details and proportion, needs fluid harmony between imagining and
executing. </p>
<p>Eyes, fingers, wrist, feet,
brain... in fact every part of the body needs to align itself and
co-ordinate with others to bring the sculpture into existence. It’s nothing
short of a meditation and there is no margin for error.</p>
<p>And yet despite all its novelty, hot glass sculpting is a
dying art.</p>
<p>There were times in history when India had Kings with a keen
eye for arts that are beautiful, unique and mesmerizing. They encouraged
artists to explore the unimaginable by rewarding them handsomely, not just with
gold but also with public recognition. And so, the culture of experimentation
in arts flourished. Stone, clay, glass, wood, paper, metal everything and
anything would be worked upon and turned into something magnificent.</p>
<p>But slowly, with the advent of industrialization and mass
production, the traditional arts began to be neglected and in search of daily
livelihood the artists ceased to transfer their skills to the next generation.</p>
<p>Amongst such arts that are on the verge
of extinction is Hot Glass Sculpting and Yogesh is amongst a few artists who are keeping it alive even
today. </p>
<p>Yogesh’s family has been making hot glass sculptures for
centuries with the skill been passed on from one generation to other. But both
Yogesh and his elder brother, were reluctant to pursue the life of an artist,
for they've seen it brings neither money nor recognition. It’s a life of
struggle that nobody would choose to live.</p>
<p>But then destiny has its own way…and when his Father, who
had been making sculptures for 30 years, suffered from a stroke, Yogesh had no
choice but to fall in and soon discover that the skill came naturally to him.
He has been creating and relishing these beautiful sculptures for past 12 years
now.</p>
<p>Living in a rented small village home, Yogesh has simple
dreams…first to start his own academy wherein he can pass on the art to as many
as possible and second to someday live in his own home. </p>
<p>You can help Yogesh to fulfill his dreams. Please check our
perks and contribute if you feel it is worth. Your support will empower Yogesh
to continue making this world more beautiful.</p>

<p></p></div>","Hot Glass Sculpting




Yogesh, a young artist from the small Indian Village has a rare gift. He is
one of those few artists who can transform a piece of glass into anything he
wish – birds, fishes, animals, fruits, trees and even humans hunting in the
wild. Anything and everything that he can imagine can be sculpted from the
molten glass.


And he does it without
electricity, moulds, dies or any special equipment whatsoever. Just a kerosene
burner flame, glass rod, broken pieces of colored glass bangles and ordinary
home tools. 
Even the compressor required to
regulate the flame intensity is pedal operated and designed and custom built
entirely from cardboard. Isn't that amazing?




The process, known as Hot Glass
Sculpting, is deceptively simple.The
glass crystals are softened into viscous fluid by directly inserting in the
flame and then given the desired shape and colors before it cools down. That is
it....no rocket science.
But as said, the simplicity is
misleading. Transforming the glass crystals into a colorful sculpture with
perfect details and proportion, needs fluid harmony between imagining and
executing. 
Eyes, fingers, wrist, feet,
brain... in fact every part of the body needs to align itself and
co-ordinate with others to bring the sculpture into existence. It’s nothing
short of a meditation and there is no margin for error.
And yet despite all its novelty, hot glass sculpting is a
dying art.
There were times in history when India had Kings with a keen
eye for arts that are beautiful, unique and mesmerizing. They encouraged
artists to explore the unimaginable by rewarding them handsomely, not just with
gold but also with public recognition. And so, the culture of experimentation
in arts flourished. Stone, clay, glass, wood, paper, metal everything and
anything would be worked upon and turned into something magnificent.
But slowly, with the advent of industrialization and mass
production, the traditional arts began to be neglected and in search of daily
livelihood the artists ceased to transfer their skills to the next generation.
Amongst such arts that are on the verge
of extinction is Hot Glass Sculpting and Yogesh is amongst a few artists who are keeping it alive even
today. 
Yogesh’s family has been making hot glass sculptures for
centuries with the skill been passed on from one generation to other. But both
Yogesh and his elder brother, were reluctant to pursue the life of an artist,
for they've seen it brings neither money nor recognition. It’s a life of
struggle that nobody would choose to live.
But then destiny has its own way…and when his Father, who
had been making sculptures for 30 years, suffered from a stroke, Yogesh had no
choice but to fall in and soon discover that the skill came naturally to him.
He has been creating and relishing these beautiful sculptures for past 12 years
now.
Living in a rented small village home, Yogesh has simple
dreams…first to start his own academy wherein he can pass on the art to as many
as possible and second to someday live in his own home. 
You can help Yogesh to fulfill his dreams. Please check our
perks and contribute if you feel it is worth. Your support will empower Yogesh
to continue making this world more beautiful.

<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>First of all, let us introduce ourselves! We are three graduate students, two from China: Uta and Xinyue and one from Mexico: Sofia, and together, we are co-curating<i> I Dreamed I Was Asleep</i>, the first solo show for Iranian contemporary artist Habib Saher.</p>
<h3>About the Exhibition</h3>
<p>I Dreamed I Was Asleep, is a new series of paintings and sculptures that deal with the artist’s conflicting relationship with mortality and the concept of the afterlife.  </p>
<p>Through these works, we are confronted with Saher’s intimate relationship and doubts about the religious belief on life after death and human interaction and the influence his culture’s religious and political beliefs has had on this ongoing questioning.</p>
<p>As part of this project, the artist has chosen to showcase the works in a specific atmosphere, a completely dark room. Each piece has its own lighting mechanism, and the contrasting light creates a dramatic, nightmare-like ambiance. It is through this sensorial and intellectual stimulation of moving within the shadow-filled, dark space that the viewer not only experiences the artworks, but is immersed into the artist’s conception of the afterlife; a dream of being asleep.</p>
<h3>About the Artist</h3>
<p>Habib Saher (born 1986, lives and works in Iran, Azerbaijan and Paris) works with a wide variety of materials and his investigation revolves around the thematic of death and temporality. He has both a BA and MA in Sculpture from the Baku State Art University in Azerbaijan. He’s had both group and solo exhibitions in Iran (Naghsh Gallery), Azerbaijan (Artim Art Space, Yarat Contemporary Art Space, H.Aliyev Center, Baki Gallery, Baku Academy of Arts), and in the United States (Seed Corn Gallery, California). He is now showing for the first time in Paris. </p>
<h3><strong><i>I Dreamed I Was Asleep</i> will take place at:</strong></h3>
<p>IESA la galerie, 1 Cité Griset 75011 Paris, France</p>
<p>November 22- 27, 2017</p>
<p>Opening: Wednesday November 22 from 7-10 PM</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Since we are students, you might understand we are dealing with very limited budgets, and this is why we are asking for your help!</p>
<p><strong>Your contributions will be directed towards:</strong></p>
<p>-Shipping and Packaging Costs</p>
<p>-Mounting material costs</p>
<p>-Publicity costs (<i>Printing costs for flyers and posters, fcbk post boost, etc</i>)</p>

<p>This campaign/event is an opportunity for artists/students from across the Midlands to come together and share their skills and knowledge from their artistic areas in order to learn off one another and create together through improvised play. The individuals involved will be engaging in an evening of improvised activities with which are focused on building relationships and trust. We aim to bring together dancers, musicians, performance artists, photographers and many more uniting their unique talents and creating something spectacular as a result!</p>
<p>This campaign is extremely important to me as I am aware that are not many opportunities available at the moment specifically in the Midlands that enable artists of different disciplines to collaborate, as a consequence artists often shy away from working with other artists that do not share their particular skill sets. From personal experience, I have found that when I have collaborated with students from different artistic backgrounds we have learnt a great deal from one another which has in turn benefited our own practice and given us more confidence as practitioners.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<p>Ideally we would need £800 of funding in order for the event to take place. This would cover:</p>
<p>1) Paying staff that we have employed to help aid the event such as, security and helpers to dress and clean the space (insisted by the venue at £20 an hour), extra helpers to help transport equipment and set up equipment, photographers and film editors to record the event.</p>
<p>2) Purchase of the refreshments, food and alcoholic beverages.</p>
<p>3) Surface materials to keep the space safe and comfortable. We aim to create a 'chilled area' within the space where artists can get to know one another and discuss their subject areas in a relaxed areas so we would like to purchase some materials and throws to create this section, along with seating such as bean bags or sofas.  We also want to use plastic sheeting to protect walls in the space where artists such as painters or performance artists could get their creative juices flowing and have the freedom to use paint and other materials without harming the space.</p>
<p>4) Room hire</p>

Help us build K9 of Dr Who fame as an art car. K9 will provide space for a driver and approximately 4 passengers. The driver sits on K9's back and the passengers will stand on the side of K9 with their feet on his lower running boards. With his passengers, K9 will traverse the far reaches of the universe and see that they return home safely.K9 dimensions will be approximately:
Length - 8' 10"" (269 cm)
Width - 5' 4"" (152 cm)
Height (at head) - 7' 5"" (213 cm)

Height (at back) - 5' 6"" (152 cm)

K9's first public sighting will be at Burning Man 2014 with the primary mission to be ambassador to the people of Burning Man for the Quixote's Cabaret Club & Bar camp. The QCCB cabaret venue will be decorated in the style of the Tardis from Dr Who and at various times, the camp members will be costumed as characters from the show or characters they imagine would be in the Dr Who universe. By traveling the pathways of the playa, K9 will be able to let people know about the camp and cabaret that will be held on various nights.Who We ArePeter has a professional background as a software developer but has been working as a senior studio manager and pyrotechnician at The Crucible in Oakland for the past 8 years. He bring strong design and fabrication skills in metal working, foundry work and fire. He'll be tapping into his extended community of friends in the San Francisco Bay Area to help bring K9 to life. The work will be done at Peter's studio at Lost & Foundry Oakland. Mary brings a strong editorial bias and outstanding project management skills. Her ability to wrangling artists is legendary and will help keep the project on target and on time.Treee, a QCCB camp member since 2006, is also a researcher  in the Centre for HCI Design at City University London and a lifelong maker/tinkerer. She will be crossing the Atlantic several weeks before the Burn to apprentice herself to Peter and make sure that anyone who drives or rides K9 has the best possible user experience.Olivier has been wrangling with computers and robots since he was a small child. He still has nightmares from his first viewing in 1975 of Dr Who and hopes that building K9 will have a therapeutic effect. He’s wanted an Art Car since his first burn in 2006.Monty has been part of Quixote’s cabaret since 2005, when he was one of team who should have known better and decided to run a Cabaret camp at BRC from the UK! He has always been far too interested in science fiction and the adventures ofa certain Doctor. Basically, as we are building the TARDIS on the playa this year, our first Art Car had to be either a sofa (to hide behind) or K9!QCCB & K9Here's some members of the Quixote's Cabaret Club & Bar on the project:What We Need & What You GetWith the funding that you help provide, we will:
Repurpose an electric golf cart to be the base frame.
Upgrade the suspension to better support the new load and passengers.
Build an internal frame of aluminum and add a aluminum skin.
Fabricate the support and mechanism needed to move the steering controls to the head of K9.
Create the mechanisms needed for K9's head and antenna to move.
Add a CO2 nozzle and laser to K9's nose.
Set up a sound system to play K9 sounds.
Add lights for night driving.
In turn, we'll give you:
Our thanks.
Stickers, patches and t-shirts with the K9 Mark IV-BM project logo.
Your name immortalized on K9's back panel.
Art tours on the Playa.
Ice deliveries to your camp on the Playa.
An opportunity to drive K9.
A visit from K9 to a place of your choosing in the San Francisco Bay Area.
Stretch Goals
For an additional $2,250, we can upgrade the base cart to be a utility vehicle instead of a golf cart.
For $500 over that, we'll upgrade the frame and skin to stainless steel.
And for an additional $500, we'll add a large scale flame effect to K9.
Other Ways You Can HelpWe realize that some people can't contribute directly to the fund but that doesn't mean they can't help:
Tell your friends and family about the campaign and ask them to support it. 

Share the campaign on Twitter, Facebook and your favorite social site.

If you're in the San Francisco Bay Area, volunteer some time to help build K9.

<p>Across the River Arts needs your help to showcase the work of 22 talented emerging visual and performing artists at the Fremont Abbey Arts Center on July 12, 2012!  The theme of the work will reflect the selected artist’s interpretations of “Extraordinary in the Everyday.”  This event is an opportunity for developing artists to showcase their work to a welcoming audience and reach an innovative section of the arts community.  Be one of the first people to support these artists on their path to creating groundbreaking work.</p>
<h3><strong>Show Details                                                     </strong></h3>
<p>Visual artists will be featured in a gallery/café space in the Abbey from 7:00-11:00 pm, and selected art will remain in the café until July 26th. The performance will be from 8:00-10:30 pm with an extended intermission to view and talk with the visual and performing artists. </p>
<p>Show artists were selected through an open call process in early May and will include a variety of disciplines including painting, photography, mixed media, sculpture, video/film, dance, music, spoken word, and theater.  The show will represent a collection of work from many disciplines, allowing a well-rounded experience for artists and the audience alike. Visual artists may choose to sell work at the show as well.  See a similar show we hosted in 2011, Twentyfive <a href=""http://www.acrosstheriverarts.org/our-projects/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.acrosstheriverarts.org/our-projects/</a>. </p>
<h3><strong>Show Expenses</strong></h3>
<p>This event is produced entirely by volunteers, including artistic director Ginny Sanchez Ballard and collaborator Jeff Ballard. We have worked to make the show as inexpensive as possible and are lucky to have the sponsorship of the Fremont Abbey Arts Center to help with space costs, insurance, equipment, and much more.  Abbey volunteers are helping by accepting in-kind services for running sound and day-of show coordination.  We will have a volunteer photographer and poster designer as well.  <strong>Income from ticket sales goes directly to the artists if we reach our goal. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Your donation will help pay for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Space Rental &amp; Gallery Supplies: </strong>The Fremont Abbey Arts Center covers some of these costs, but your donation helps cover the costs for gallery supplies, a house manager, café staff, sound and lighting equipment and other rental fees and gallery supplies.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<strong>Videographer:</strong> We believe it is vital for the performing artists in the program to have documentation of their work. We will also be able to use this documentation to advocate for funding in the future.</li>

<p></p><p><b>THE STORY</b></p><p>For years, the artists of the Plume Project have worked and lived in downtown Saint Paul, fascinated and wonder-struck at the majestic cloud coming from the District Energy St. Paul facility. Upon taking a tour we learned the power plant generates local energy primarily from renewable and efficient energy sources and is recognized as a world-class facility. Inspired by the tour, we wanted to know if the steam plume could be used as a canvas for large scale projected displays.  So we got together around a campfire and simulated the steam plume with a stockpot of water.  As soon as we flipped on the video projector the vapor came to life.  It was magical to look at!  </p><ul>

Using poetry, education, power, and light this project will impact the residents, workers, and visitors of downtown St. Paul. The Plume Project will use the steam plume from District Energy's Biomass Power Plant as a high profile stage for light displays, addressing the topic of energy within three distinct artworks. 

Emily Stover will use poetry to talk about city infrastructure 
Aaron Dysart is representing NASA Satellite data of the sun’s surface
Asia Ward is creating a community drawing platform about positive energy This three month event in the sky will crown the city during the coldest months in
Minnesota when the plume often stretches across St. Paul like a massive
cloud.  With theatrical flood lights and a large venue projector the Plume
Project will celebrate an internationally recognized community energy system
and also bring attention to St. Paul’s newly minted Eco District.

WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP
This project is too big to be carried by a
handful of people.  We know its impact will be huge.  We simply
cannot do it alone.  This is a fantastic project and it needs your help.  

We have
secured a matching grant through the Knight Foundation so every dollar you
donate will be matched.  Our goal is to have you back us in any way you can, so that
during the coming winter you can look above the city of St. Paul and know you played a part
in something big.  
You can help us create a powerful stage for
artists and an environmental education platform in the sky.   Thank you
for your support. LET'S LIGHT THE PLUME!  
WHERE YOUR MONEY GOESYour tax-deductible support will light the plume throughout the winter of 2015-2016 by allowing us to hire professional technicians, obtain equipment suited for this highly exposed location, and mount the first-rate city-scale public art installation Saint Paul deserves. Please consider being a part of making the Plume Project a beloved part of Saint Paul this winter. HOW YOU CAN HELPAnything you can give to support this project matters to us, and will help make the project a success.  If you can't contribute with a donation, that's okay!  There are other ways you can help: 
Help us get the word out about the Plume Project.  Pass on our campaign by sharing it, telling people about it, liking us on Facebook, and tweeting about us, 
If our campaign is funded, keep an eye out for a call for artwork, and submit!
Volunteer opportunities will become available. Sign up and we'll keep you updated. 
Come and check out the projects during their show times! Document and share!

THE STORYFor years, the artists of the Plume Project have worked and lived in downtown Saint Paul, fascinated and wonder-struck at the majestic cloud coming from the District Energy St. Paul facility. Upon taking a tour we learned the power plant generates local energy primarily from renewable and efficient energy sources and is recognized as a world-class facility. Inspired by the tour, we wanted to know if the steam plume could be used as a canvas for large scale projected displays.  So we got together around a campfire and simulated the steam plume with a stockpot of water.  As soon as we flipped on the video projector the vapor came to life.  It was magical to look at!  
THE ARTISTS AND THEIR PROJECTSVOICES FROM THE DEEP     NOVEMBER 2015EMILY STOVER is a multidisciplinary designer and public artist whose work focuses on temporary environments, experiential art, and public engagement as ways of investigating how people live together within the landscape.Voices from the Deep, will commission local poets to create original work about District Energy and its presence in the city. Utilizing a theatrical light show that is triggered by a phone system, the public will call a number to hear one of the poems read for them alone, while the plume’s lights are animated in sync for the entire city to see.SOLAR SYSTEM    DECEMBER 2015/JANUARY 2016AARON DYSART is a sculptor whose environmental interventions push ideas of propriety, gift giving, and reciprocity. He has exhibited nationally, and has received support through numerous local foundations and organizations.Solar System will use data from NASA’s Solar Dynamic Observatory to present an ever-changing light show on the plume. As spots and storms ebb and flow on the sun (the “power plant” at the center of our solar system), color-changing flood lights inside the steam plume will shift and dim in tandem. The dynamic nature of our ultimate source of energy will be made visible throughout downtown Saint Paul.PLUME COLORING CONTEST    JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2016ASIA WARD works between the realms of science, art, and education. Through her work with the Science Museum of Minnesota, REcharge Labs, and for artist residencies around the US, Asia creates public art projects and educational activities about the environment, water systems, and electric power production.Plume Coloring Contest is an open call for local residents to submit content based on the topic “Positive Energy.” Selected images will be curated and projected onto the District Energy steam plume for the whole city to enjoy.MAJOR SPONSORSHIP LEVEL PERK INFORMATIONBanner: A 6’ x 20’ banner will be installed on the western wall of downtown District Energy plant at Kellogg Boulevard and Market Street from October 2015 through February 2016.  This highly visible location, adjacent to the Science Museum and the George Latimer Library, will ensure prime exposure to Kellogg Boulevard pedestrians and vehicle traffic.  Additional street signage is planned for the duration of each project. Launch Party: 11-17-2015  5:30pm-7:30pm.

<p><b>1) Imagine When… Billboards</b></p>
<p>Last year The Imagination
Installation (ii) Project ran beautiful and evocative digital billboards on
Business 40 and Hwy 52 featuring dreams from real people in Winston-Salem.
 </p>
<p>All the dreams started with the statement ""Imagine
When....""</p>
<p>People told us how much they loved
seeing the billboards when they were driving on the highway because each time
they read one they got a mood-boost or felt inspired to dream bigger in their
own life... or for our community.</p>
<p><b>We need your help to bring the
Imagine When.... Billboards back.</b></p>

Think
about how cool would it be to see YOUR dream on a Billboard. Dreams we
showcased on Business 40 included:<div>
<p></p>
<p>Imagine When... <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We greet strangers as friends. ~ Cheryl</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Imagine When... Compassion guides our decisions. ~ Jerry</span><br/></p>
<p>Imagine When...  Healthy food is available to everyone. ~ Deb</p>
<p>Imagine When... All animals are treated with respect. - Sandy</p>

<p><b>2) More Interactive Public Art!!!</b></p>
<p>We also want to generate more
interactive public art in our community.</p>
<p>Local artist Wren Wilson, as part of Imagination
Installations, has been invited by Associated Artists to create a fabulous new interactive exhibit
for the lobby of the Milton Rhodes Arts Center. But her invitation didn't come
with cash.... so we need some to pay for her supplies and creativity. </p>
<p>Wren has designed a large scale, interactive exhibit that
features 3-D, 8-foot high reflective shapes that will be suspended from the
ceiling. As the shapes gently turn, our community’s dreams will be showcased
and people will see their image in the mirrored surfaces. Wren hopes people
will be inspired by the installation to understand that they are also dreamers
and are the ones responsible for creating the life they want.</p>
<p>Below is a photo of Wren at the New Winston Museum. She is
standing in front of the public art installation she created for Imagination
Installations with the help of youth from Authoring Action. The project was

cover the foam core, paint and other secret supplies Wren uses to create.</p>
<p>$400 to local artist Wren Wilson for
a very small portion of her time concepting, researching, designing and
building the art installation with the knowledge she gained, in part, during
her time at Salem College.  We have a big
dream that all artists get paid for their community work. By donated to this
campaign you can be part of making that dream come true.</p>
<p>$2,273 for six weeks of space on prominent
digital billboards on Business 40 to showcase dreams in our community from
people like YOU.</p>
<p><b>What Will Happen If We Raise Extra Money</b></p>
<p>We can have space on multiple
billboards throughout the Triad for a few months… or heck if this this goes viral and people are
uber generous… for a year!  </p>
<p>Wren can make our next public art
exhibit even more intricate and expansive and could even do a second
installation using the dreams people shared in this first piece.</p>

</div><div> <p>This is a BIG dream that comes with challenges.  If we don't meet our goal:</p>
<p>- We will only be able to have your dreams featured on a billboard for a few days vs. a few months.</p>
<p>-  Wren's art installation will have to be scaled down dramatically and won't have the large scale WOW factor she envisions.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">But we are confident that that won't happen.  Why? Because since Imagination Installations launched three years ago we have seen the generous, amazing people in our community step up to the plate to help dreams come true.  Now YOU have a chance to be part of the Tribe of Dreamers that loves making big things happen.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;""></span></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Why is Dreaming and Imagination Important?</b></p>
<p>We believe that everyone is using their imagination all the time to co-create our world. We are aware of the nightmares some of us have inadvertently dreamed into being. We created this Project to model positive dreaming and the use of imagination so that people can consciously create communities that are connected, compassionate, healthy, abundant, creative and vibrant.  For the past three years we have also witnessed something amazing that happens when people learn how to dream in the positive and share their dreams out loud. They discover that other people share their dream... or become inspired to take action to help them build their dream. The cross-polinization of imagination and connections have immediate impact.</p>

<p><b>Who is ii?</b></p>
<p>Imagination Installations (ii) is a
grassroots project, newly incorporated as a 501(c)(3), fueled by artists,
entrepreneurs, community leaders, teachers, business owners, shamans,
executives, poets and others who love to innovate and dream big in their own
lives and for their communities. We launched on a beautiful fall day at Camino Bakery in Winston-Salem,
NC in 2011. The next year we expanded into Greensboro when one of our founding
volunteers, Cyndi Briggs, delivered a TEDx Talk on the power of Imagination.</p>
<p>The Imagination Installation Project is about the art
of ""Dreaming Into Being."" We love building Imaginariums and dream-incubators
with the Triad Tribe of North Carolina. Imaginariums are places (i.e. our web
site, public art installations, events) where people can record their dreams
and discover what others have shared using the statement <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>""Imagine When...""</b></span></p>

</div></div>","When You Dream Big You Build Community 
At the Imagination Installations
Project, a 501(c)(3), we believe in co-creating our world by unleashing the power of
imagination one dream at a time. 
Through this campaign we want to shine the spotlight
on the powerful, positive people in our community who are taking action to
make their world a better place.  By
donating even $1 YOU become one of those people.


Two
Ways Your Donation Will Make a Difference
1)  Imagine
driving down business 40 and seeing billboards that inspire you or make you
smile instead of just seeing ads for people trying to sell you stuff.  
2)  Imagine
that our community is rich with positive, interactive public art that helps
people of all ages access their dreams for the future and what they want to
create for themselves, their children, their pets and the earth.  
When you donate to this Dream Campaign you will be using your imagination to co-create the world you want to live in.




1) Imagine When… Billboards
Last year The Imagination
Installation (ii) Project ran beautiful and evocative digital billboards on
Business 40 and Hwy 52 featuring dreams from real people in Winston-Salem.
 
All the dreams started with the statement ""Imagine
When....""
People told us how much they loved
seeing the billboards when they were driving on the highway because each time
they read one they got a mood-boost or felt inspired to dream bigger in their
own life... or for our community.
We need your help to bring the
Imagine When.... Billboards back.

Think
about how cool would it be to see YOUR dream on a Billboard. Dreams we
showcased on Business 40 included:

Imagine When... We greet strangers as friends. ~ Cheryl
Imagine When... Compassion guides our decisions. ~ Jerry
Imagine When...  Healthy food is available to everyone. ~ Deb
Imagine When... All animals are treated with respect. - Sandy
Imagine When... Every child can read. ~ Annie
Imagine When... We educate vs. incarcerate. ~ Shelley




2) More Interactive Public Art!!!
We also want to generate more
interactive public art in our community.
Local artist Wren Wilson, as part of Imagination
Installations, has been invited by Associated Artists to create a fabulous new interactive exhibit
for the lobby of the Milton Rhodes Arts Center. But her invitation didn't come
with cash.... so we need some to pay for her supplies and creativity. 
Wren has designed a large scale, interactive exhibit that
features 3-D, 8-foot high reflective shapes that will be suspended from the
ceiling. As the shapes gently turn, our community’s dreams will be showcased
and people will see their image in the mirrored surfaces. Wren hopes people
will be inspired by the installation to understand that they are also dreamers
and are the ones responsible for creating the life they want.
Below is a photo of Wren at the New Winston Museum. She is
standing in front of the public art installation she created for Imagination
Installations with the help of youth from Authoring Action. The project was
part of Winston-Salem's Centennial Celebration.



What We Need & What You Get

Our project budget is $3,133.  The funds we raise will go to:
$460 for materials to create the
interactive public art exhibit including: giant foam core, reflective sheets to
cover the foam core, paint and other secret supplies Wren uses to create.
$400 to local artist Wren Wilson for
a very small portion of her time concepting, researching, designing and
building the art installation with the knowledge she gained, in part, during
her time at Salem College.  We have a big
dream that all artists get paid for their community work. By donated to this
campaign you can be part of making that dream come true.
$2,273 for six weeks of space on prominent
digital billboards on Business 40 to showcase dreams in our community from
people like YOU.
What Will Happen If We Raise Extra Money
We can have space on multiple
billboards throughout the Triad for a few months… or heck if this this goes viral and people are
uber generous… for a year!  
Wren can make our next public art
exhibit even more intricate and expansive and could even do a second
installation using the dreams people shared in this first piece.

Risks & Challenges
 This is a BIG dream that comes with challenges.  If we don't meet our goal:
- We will only be able to have your dreams featured on a billboard for a few days vs. a few months.
-  Wren's art installation will have to be scaled down dramatically and won't have the large scale WOW factor she envisions.
But we are confident that that won't happen.  Why? Because since Imagination Installations launched three years ago we have seen the generous, amazing people in our community step up to the plate to help dreams come true.  Now YOU have a chance to be part of the Tribe of Dreamers that loves making big things happen.

Why is Dreaming and Imagination Important?
We believe that everyone is using their imagination all the time to co-create our world. We are aware of the nightmares some of us have inadvertently dreamed into being. We created this Project to model positive dreaming and the use of imagination so that people can consciously create communities that are connected, compassionate, healthy, abundant, creative and vibrant.  For the past three years we have also witnessed something amazing that happens when people learn how to dream in the positive and share their dreams out loud. They discover that other people share their dream... or become inspired to take action to help them build their dream. The cross-polinization of imagination and connections have immediate impact.



Who is ii?
Imagination Installations (ii) is a
grassroots project, newly incorporated as a 501(c)(3), fueled by artists,
entrepreneurs, community leaders, teachers, business owners, shamans,
executives, poets and others who love to innovate and dream big in their own
lives and for their communities. We launched on a beautiful fall day at Camino Bakery in Winston-Salem,
NC in 2011. The next year we expanded into Greensboro when one of our founding
volunteers, Cyndi Briggs, delivered a TEDx Talk on the power of Imagination.
The Imagination Installation Project is about the art
of ""Dreaming Into Being."" We love building Imaginariums and dream-incubators
with the Triad Tribe of North Carolina. Imaginariums are places (i.e. our web
site, public art installations, events) where people can record their dreams
and discover what others have shared using the statement ""Imagine When...""
Imagination Installations' Board of
Directors/Vision Circle:
Teddy Burriss, Sheri Clawson, Taylor Johnson, Tim Johnson, Cheryl Schirillo-Johnson, Sandy Phocas, Subash Shah, Robin White
Star, and Amanda Zabel.

<h3>                 <strong>D.O.D. - ""Dangers of Drugs""</strong>
</h3>
<p>The introduction picture of me holding the painting of Gabby Douglas represents the heights that can be reached by our youth when they are not influenced by the dangers of drugs. There are a lot of Gabby Douglas's in the world; some will and some will not achieve the heights that this young star has risen to be. With this campaign hopefully it will influence other youths to follow the example she has set and not let the D.O.D. extinguish their glow.</p>
<p>I Linwood Pettaway have been an artist all of my life, drawing pictures since the age of twelve. I have always been interested in drawing portraits. Besides doing portraitures of family members; I have enjoyed doing the faces that we all love and recognize. Residing in Hollywood for over 10 years led me to become even more interested in the drawing of famous people.</p>
<p>It is sad but true that some of the biggest names in entertainment have ""Fallen"" due to the use of Drugs; both legal and illegal.</p>
<p>I believe that by bringing to the publics attention in the form of a well illustrated portrait series of some of the most highly recognized ""Fallen Stars""; that it will help raise the awareness in our youth and society as to the real ""Dangers of Drugs"". Upon finalizing this series’ editions; they will be displayed in public places where our youth gathers; IE: homes, schools, universities, libraries, galleries, and businesses across the US to further increase their awareness as to the dangers of drugs. This will help start the discussion of this public dilemma and how each of these well known figures lives had been ended by the D.O.D. ""Danger of Drugs"". The length of time that one engaged in its’ use placed a long toll on themselves, their loved ones &amp; relatives; and should have been avoided. With this campaign this awareness will hit home.</p>
<p>I am asking for your support &amp; funding in order that I may apply the ""time"" necessary to complete this ""Fallen Stars - D.O.D."" series. We are seeking to raise $25K to help cover some of the funds that will be needed to sustain the expenses of our Art Gallery and Studio space during this time. Funds will be used to purchase the materials &amp; supplies required to Print &amp; distribute the pieces that you will receive as gifts for your pledges. Funds will also be used to produce multiple copies of this series in order to get them out to the public to have them displayed in the venues mentioned above.</p>
<p>Each of these (27) ""Fallen Stars"" will be rendered in Colored Pencil. The reproductions will be limited and hand signed personally for each pledge; matted and/or framed based upon your level of pledge. For those of you who are more generous in your pledging; you will receive Originals as well as Framed and Matted Prints.</p>
<p>If our funding goal is not fully reached in the allotted time period; we will use the funds we have at that time to produce as many sets possible. Our main goal is to get this ""Fallen Stars – D.O.D."" series in as many schools, universities and public libraries as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If you are not able to help with funding at this time; please help us by getting the word out to parents, business owners, local &amp; state government figures and school administrators. By getting others to follow our project; it will increase the awareness of our ""Fallen Stars"" series that we will soon have available. These tools will help start the open discussion of what really does happen to one when they are involved with drugs; legal or illegal. The real images that hit home are of the ones we have in our memories of a close friend or relative whose lights were never allowed to shine. With your help we can maintain the needed momentum to get this series out to the public ASAP. Please use the Indiegogo share tools to help us reach a larger audience.</p>
<p> </p>

I believe that by bringing to the publics attention in the form of a well illustrated portrait series of some of the most highly recognized ""Fallen Stars""; that it will help raise the awareness in our youth and society as to the real ""Dangers of Drugs"". Upon finalizing this series’ editions; they will be displayed in public places where our youth gathers; IE: homes, schools, universities, libraries, galleries, and businesses across the US to further increase their awareness as to the dangers of drugs. This will help start the discussion of this public dilemma and how each of these well known figures lives had been ended by the D.O.D. ""Danger of Drugs"". The length of time that one engaged in its’ use placed a long toll on themselves, their loved ones & relatives; and should have been avoided. With this campaign this awareness will hit home.
I am asking for your support & funding in order that I may apply the ""time"" necessary to complete this ""Fallen Stars - D.O.D."" series. We are seeking to raise $25K to help cover some of the funds that will be needed to sustain the expenses of our Art Gallery and Studio space during this time. Funds will be used to purchase the materials & supplies required to Print & distribute the pieces that you will receive as gifts for your pledges. Funds will also be used to produce multiple copies of this series in order to get them out to the public to have them displayed in the venues mentioned above.
Each of these (27) ""Fallen Stars"" will be rendered in Colored Pencil. The reproductions will be limited and hand signed personally for each pledge; matted and/or framed based upon your level of pledge. For those of you who are more generous in your pledging; you will receive Originals as well as Framed and Matted Prints.
If our funding goal is not fully reached in the allotted time period; we will use the funds we have at that time to produce as many sets possible. Our main goal is to get this ""Fallen Stars – D.O.D."" series in as many schools, universities and public libraries as soon as possible.
If you are not able to help with funding at this time; please help us by getting the word out to parents, business owners, local & state government figures and school administrators. By getting others to follow our project; it will increase the awareness of our ""Fallen Stars"" series that we will soon have available. These tools will help start the open discussion of what really does happen to one when they are involved with drugs; legal or illegal. The real images that hit home are of the ones we have in our memories of a close friend or relative whose lights were never allowed to shine. With your help we can maintain the needed momentum to get this series out to the public ASAP. Please use the Indiegogo share tools to help us reach a larger audience.
 
Thank you for your time, efforts & pledges. Help us successfully reach our goal; which is to get this D.O.D. discussion started with
the completion & conveyance of this portrait series. Let’s make this happen!

<h2><strong>MESSAGE FROM PARADE CO-FOUNDERS</strong></h2>
<p>Hello friends, neighbors, and art lovers! Join PARADE, a new public art program serving Queens to develop of a fantastical variety show showcasing some of Woodside’s best talent! During a two-week workshop intensive at Sunnyside Reformed Church, the artist collective Whoop Dee Doo will collaborate with local teens and arts groups from all backgrounds to create an extraordinary FREE performance for kids, adults, and possibly even dogs on August 31st at Windmuller Park! — Paddy Johnson and Nancy Kleaver</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560219111/zdwf5kaama8ge8ow2jft.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>Whoop Dee Doo at the Highline, 2016</i></p> <h2><strong>ABOUT THE EVENT</strong></h2>
<p>Whoop Dee Doo at Windmuller Park Project is a live variety show directed by the artist collective “Whoop Dee Doo,” in collaboration with local youth and community groups. In a time when human rights horrors dominate headlines around the world, a project celebrating unconditional love and difference feels more important than ever.</p>
<p>Using Windmuller Park and Bandshell as venue and inspiration, the project celebrates this heavily-used public space and the diverse cultures of its visitors with the people of Queens. Hosted by outlandish pop-culture inspired characters, the show will connect audiences and performers through artmaking and performance. A wide variety of surrounding arts and cultural groups will contribute “acts” and collaborate on new pieces to create a truly unique show that captures the beauty and character of the Woodside community. Current partners include McManus Irish Dance, Tibetan Community Center of NY &amp; NJ, Woodside Dance Troupe, Bula Arts &amp; Culture, and Queens Music Academy. Additional partners will be announced throughout the summer.</p>
<p>PARADE is also coordinating with local youth organizations and schools to recruit an ensemble of Queens teens to work alongside Whoop Dee Doo artists to shape the structure of the show, create original dialogue, movement, visual art, and soundscapes, perform and work backstage. The project will be a truly unique, cross-disciplinary, and crazy-creative process that's like nothing our participants will have done before, developing creative problem solving and teamwork skills.</p>
<p>The end result will connect diverse yet often isolated populations in this neighborhood of over 45,000 people through the artmaking and performance. Importantly, the neighborhood will also get the show of their lives—and all for free.</p>

You may know my wife Katie and I from the Vegas burner community. We built this car from the ground up this year to help our camp with transportation and to take our 1 year old son on adventures at Burning Man.

The majority of the parts on the car are custom made involving 3d printing and machined parts on a lathe and mill. Even the lighting uses a new product from China that I have not seen used before, I think it is superior to the traditional LED strips and would like to introduce it to my fellow builders.</div><div> </div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are trying to raise at least $1500 towards getting the car to and from Burning Man. Any additional funds will go towards final details on the car such as speakers for the sound system, some decorative material for the bed sides, and battery upgrades. Unfortunately, due to unforeseen financial obligations we may not be able to go at all this year without a little support.</p>
<p>In return for your help we have stickers from our crew and are offering personal rides and playa tours. The car is available for your playa event, wedding or airport runs! Lastly, we are offering 24 hour blocks with the car. You will get a crash course on operating the car and must have a valid drivers license and be sober. If you would like to experience what Burning Man is like with your own personal art car, this is your chance!</p>
<p>Of course everyone is welcome to come by our camp (Contraptionists at 7:30 &amp; E) for cold drinks and freshly shaved snow cones! We are also putting on a service to Black Rock city called ""Fix Your Broken Shit"".

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I have been building art cars and sculptures for other designers full time for several years now but this is my first personal car. I have used everything I learned along the way in the design of this car and believe it can make a valuable contribution to the mutant vehicle community.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This car is already operational and tested. As always, the playa is unpredictable and this car has not been proven in that environment yet. I do have a lot of experience with the logistics and maintenance of art cars that go to Burning Man and will have all the tools I can imagine needing for any issue that may arise.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you know someone who might be interested in one of the 24 hour blocks of time with our car or a camp that needs transportation, let them know about this campaign! We can provide airport runs, ice runs, etc. The car has a cargo bed perfect for hauling ice or luggage.</p>

I do have a lot of experience with the logistics and maintenance of art cars that go to Burning Man and will have all the tools I can imagine needing for any issue that may arise.
 

Other Ways You Can Help
If you know someone who might be interested in one of the 24 hour blocks of time with our car or a camp that needs transportation, let them know about this campaign! We can provide airport runs, ice runs, etc. The car has a cargo bed perfect for hauling ice or luggage.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

I am an artist who carves sculptures into the tips of pencils. Two years ago, I quit my high-paying executive job and became a freelance artist.  My journey begun as a creative experiment and has grown into a large signature project ""Carved pencils"" that became popular today. 

Many people are already familiar with my work and have added my miniatures and sculptures to their collections. 


My fans suggested I create a book about my art. This way I have the opportunity to tell you about my work and print all the art pieces I have created to date in a single edition.

<p><br/>Each year we curate a culminating exhibition to show our final collection of works and have recently been given the opportunity to present our work in Osaka, Japan. As you might expect, this is very exciting news but the struggles of curating and organizing an international exhibition can be daunting and costly. As a result, we are hoping to fund a portion of our costs through Indiegogo while offering you a chance to own some exclusive art by some of the artists within the collective as well as our supporters.  <br/><br/></p>

He graduated from University of Toronto with a Bachelor of Arts in 2009 and is currently in his final year of Fine Arts at OCAD University. He aims to create artworks that are centred upon the individual’s relationship to his or her surroundings while often examining themes of alienation, identity, nostalgia, and the absurd. The main aspect of his work is an exploration of landscape. The attempt is to capture the visceral and peculiar elements of urban spaces, photographing images that exemplify the duality of presence and vacancy.<br/><br/><a href=""http://www.petarboskovic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.petarboskovic.com/</a><br/><br/>

</div><div><h3><br/></h3></div></div>","We are a group of artists participating in a network called INTAC (International Art Collaborations). This network is allowing those of us at OCAD University in Toronto, Canada to create collaborative artworks with partner universities in South Korea, Finland, Germany and Japan. We work primarily with photography and our overarching theme for the year is Revolution, with all the meanings which the word can inspire.   

Each year we curate a culminating exhibition to show our final collection of works and have recently been given the opportunity to present our work in Osaka, Japan. As you might expect, this is very exciting news but the struggles of curating and organizing an international exhibition can be daunting and costly. As a result, we are hoping to fund a portion of our costs through Indiegogo while offering you a chance to own some exclusive art by some of the artists within the collective as well as our supporters.  



       Highbury, 11 x 17, Archival Digital Print, 2014. Edition of 10.    Danya Ensing is a passionate young artist based in Toronto, Canada. She works largely with personal narratives and self-portraiture. The darkroom is her sanctuary – she has a skillful and accomplished knowledge of film and takes pride in processing and printing her own photographs whenever possible. The joy Danya finds in tactile work is pervasive in her photography as well as her interest in other mediums such as bookbinding and printmaking.  Exploring a variety of handmade processes challenges her creativity, encourages a deep understanding of craftsmanship, and diversifies her photographic practise. http://www.danyaensing.com/

       Mylar No.2, 16 x 16, Archival Digital Print, 2014. Edition of 10.   Katelyn Gallucci is a Toronto based artist currently completing the fourth year in Photography at OCAD University in Toronto. Most recently she participated in, a one-day group exhibition entitled, ReMove, held inside of a Uhaul truck. ReMove investigated the guidelines around designated art space. Previously, she had the experience of assisting Lili Huston-Herterich on the construction of Herterich’s Nuit Blanche exhibition, Absolutely Free Installed at OCAD University. Gallucci’s practice uses the tools and framework of photography in collaboration with found objects to investigate how we interpret, perceive and relate to objects and space.http://www.kmgallucci.com/

Vo is a multi-disciplinary artist based in Toronto, Canada. He is currently

experimental photographic techniques, he juxtaposes them with organic processes
and materials to create his works. http://www.nickvophoto.com/

Since becoming a full-time mom 4 and a half years ago, I have been on a new spiritual journey and I have fallen in love with oracle cards. This is my third card deck, my most popular was the My Quality Time self-care activity deck which was funded last year on Kickstarter. This deck was born because growing up, I had really low self-esteem and self-worth. Even now, in my mid 30's I realize, I still struggle with self-worth. I also noticed many of my friends who are well beyond their 20's and 30's, have major self-esteem and self-worth issues. This inspired me to do something about it. I wanted to show women how beautiful they are inside and out and how unnoticed it is by them. We often look for confirmation and validation from others that we are beautiful or worthy, but it truly has to come from the inside.44 cardsTrump size (2.45” x 3.95”)400 gsm matte finishGilding (stretch goal; color to be determined)Magnet box (stretch goal)Guidebook (little white booklet/deck size) includes Personal Power Affirmations, Oracle message, Journal prompts**********NEW!

It is only 70% finished and it's hard to predict how long it will take to finish it.This is my third deck, but the first time I will be printing journals and calendars, I don't know if there will be any challenges with those yet. I will be printing calendars locally at a nearby printer, but I will be ordering the journals from a new company.",25.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>As a Miami-based artist I am aware of shifting global landscapes and how this affects the tropics of South East Florida and the global south. I am fascinated by the interconnectedness of our water systems on the planet- how melting ice on one continent will tip the balance and cause the seas to rise on another. </p>

<h3>My Project:</h3>
<p>My mission is to create a cross-disciplinary project that draws from scientific research and uses ephemeral clay installations to affect a dialogue about sea level rise and its impact on the environment. It is through my unique process that I can capture a plant’s moment in time in order to recreate these delicate forms in raw clay. Collecting and casting molds of these organic forms collected in the Amazon, I will create a series of site-specific sculptures in unfired clay that will interact with Miami architecture.  It is through the ephemerality of the work and the participatory process of its creation, I wish to ultimately reference the effects of climate change and its effects on disparate landscapes. </p>
<p>Through the <a href=""http://www.labverde.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Labverde</a> Program, my experience at the National Institute of Amazonian Research labs will foster engagement well beyond this residency: I plan to invite my local community of artists, colleagues and students to participate in the creation of my project.</p>
<p>My fascination with the unseen systems in nature leads me to question how a tropical landscape can connect to other parts of the world: What issues will threaten to tip the delicate balance in different ecosystems caused by sea level rise?</p>

<li>The cost of the residency program is $2900. This is for ten days of workshops, field work with scientists, lectures, cultural exchange, special access to the Adolfo Ducke Forest Reserve and lodging. The flight, other travel expenses and visa cost is another $1500. I'm hoping to raise $4500. </li>
<li>For your contributions, I am offering the opportunity to collect my ceramic artwork at a discounted price. All works are limited edition, signed and unique to it's numbered series.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By contributing to this campaign, you help to promote awareness for impending changes to the Miami landscape through a highly unique artistic project. Although the research and collection takes place in Brazil, the actual project will ultimately end up in Miami. These ephemeral works in clay will be broken down into dry dust and recycled with water in order to build another sculpture. By eliminating the glazing and firing processes, I reduce my own carbon footprint as a ceramist, specifically from the emissions of kiln and chemical use; reclaiming and rebuilding these clay projects again and again, only to exist in memory and photographs. </p>
<p>There is much we can learn from the diverse ecology of the Amazon Rainforest. Being at ground zero for sea level rise, our community is in need of artists to take an active role in creating awareness and fostering potential solutions to a changing landscape.</p>

My name is Kelsey Anderson.  I am an artist from the Twin Cities with a lot of love for New York. Rather than making a one-off donation to the Red Cross to help with Hurricane Sandy relief, my friends and I are donating art as an incentive for others to make financial donations.
As we enjoy the holiday season, let us be grateful for a warm home to sleep in, electricity, running water, and the safety of our family and friends.  Help the Red Cross do what they do best in these disasters.

<p>The Vintage (in operation since January 2009) has served as one of the few remaining all ages venues in the greater Scranton area. The mission of The Vintage is to cultivate and exhibit original works of nearly every style/genre in the literary, performing and visual arts.</p>
<p>We believe that the arts are necessary for any city to not only survive, but thrive! With a focus on local artists/performers we have produced countless concerts, visual exhibits/installations, performance pieces, film screenings and much more (and all in under four years)! With all ages programming we maintain a firm resolve to remain accessible and approach for all artists and patrons! We strive to help as many artistic visions come to life - no matter the medium or the style - art is for everyone, everyone can be apart of art!</p>
<p>We have hosted such artists and events as The Menzingers, Ted Leo, The Spinto Band, John Bromberg, Tigers Jaw, Constance Denchy, Scranton Storyslam, The Shelby Company, Pecha Kucha Scranton, Tigers Jaw, A Fire With Friends, A Social State, Appache Chief, The Mad Conductor and many more!</p>
<p>Due to forces beyond our control we had to leave our home rather quickly. While we are proud of our work these past few years we feel there is still much to be done. We hope that the incredible art we have hosted has made some sort of impact on the community at large.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>DUBSTAR is one of the rare East Coast art cars- built by the Space Pirates and loved by everyone on our side of the island. Used locally for public recreation centers, summer camps, art events and community outings, her first trip to playa in 2011 was a huge success. Disguised as a shark, this space ship cruised the dust and shared her decks with more than 2,000 BRC Citizens over the week.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The Space Pirates are best known for our weekly, radically-inclusive art parties in Philadelphia. We invite everyone out who is intersted in making or participating in art, and regularly blow their minds with the size and scale of art we are able to produce as a team. We would LOVE to see you out there, bring whatever art you are working on or come willing to help someone else with theirs!<strong><br/></strong></p>

<h3><strong>Dubstar is is not just the Space Pirate art car- she's also the entire camp.</strong></h3>
<p>We take radical participation and inclusion to a whole new level, by keeping our interactive art project in constant play with the public and refusing the lure of a comfortable, private camp. We stay in full shwashbuckling character for the whole week, sleeping, eating, and sharing our ship on a constant cruise around the playa. Dubstar is NOT a private party ship, and we never close our decks! This year, Dubstar is equipped with $5000 in mechanical upgrades, a dance floor, hanging bike racks and dance cage, extreme amounts of lighting and sound, an AI, intercoms, hammocks, day shade, wind turbine, a grill, a full-sized interactive ships helm, innertubes for playa tubing, and this year-- a BRAND-NEW SANDWORM SKIN!! YARR!! <strong>Imagine yourself standing at the helm of the Great Sandworm Dubstar, with your pirate-shwag in hand, steering the course of your ship with the sun on your goggles and dust in your hair. Or playa-tubing in style, pulled by the great mothership.</strong></p>

</h3> <p>
</p>
<p><span>Art on the Lawn, the Giles Arts Council’s annual juried fine arts
show, is turning 10 years old!<span>  Located on the lawn of the
beautiful, historic Giles County Courthouse in Pearisburg, VA.,  Art on the Lawn has been honored by Virginia
Living Magazine as one of the top 3 arts events in Southwestern Virginia in 2012,
2013, 2014 and 2015.  Artists from
throughout Southwestern VA, southern WV, Northern VA, and several areas of North
Carolina come together to take part in this intimate, one day show. 
Visitors travel from many of the same areas to see and purchase the
wonderful art offered here.  Children and
their parents enjoy our hands on children’s are venue, Kids Art Adventure,
where they get to experience various mediums of art with teachers from the
area.</span></span></p>
<h3>With help, we can make a great show even better! <br/>
</h3>
<p><span>Art on the Lawn is a small event with a small budget.<span>  As our artists and visitors have grown to
include many different areas so has our need to advertise beyond our Giles County
limits to other areas in the New River Valley, Roanoke Valley and into West
Virginia.  This campaign will enable us
to increase our advertising capabilities into these areas in order to attract
more wonderful artists and visitors who will be a benefit to the tourism
economy of Giles County.  Part of the
money raised through this campaign will be used to expand Kids Art Adventure to
include art experiences for the tween/teen population who are not included at
the current time.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span>By contributing to this campaign you will be helping Art on the
Lawn continue our goal of providing an outlet for artists to show and sell
their art. Giles Arts Council is a 501c3 organization dedicated to the
encouragement, nurturing and promotion of the arts in Giles County, VA.<span>  Your contribution to our campaign will help
us provide an enjoyable art experience for the children of Giles County.  Right now art is not available to the
children in our schools until they reach high school and can take art as an
elective course.  Children need art from
the time they can hold a crayon, through elementary and middle school and
beyond.  </span></span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<h3>How you can help......<br/>
</h3>
<p><span>We would like to raise at least $3,000 dollars to expand our advertising from
our local newspaper to newspapers in the nearest metropolitan areas, i.e.
Roanoke, VA and Bluefield, WV.<span>  We would
like to be able to place ads in the New River Valley Magazine and The Roanoker
Magazine as well.  If we exceeded our goal, we could even consider TV ads on local networks! We also are planning to expand our Kids Art Adventure to appeal to the tweens/teens age group. More substantial materials and media will need to be purchased.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>We feels that our goals can be met, but if they are not, the funds we DO raise will go into increased advertising and into our Kids Art Adventure as far as they can be stretched. </span></span></p>

<span><span><h3>Impacting Future Artists!<br/>
</h3></span></span>
<p><span>It has been proven that those who engage in the art are more
well-rounded, and contribute more to their communities. Children who receive
art education function better in school are more disciplined, better at problem
solving and relating to others.<span>  Kids Art
Adventure is an effort to bring art education through hands on experiences to
children who otherwise would not be getting art education.  Your contribution will help this effort grow
and reach more children, tweens and teens. 
These same children will someday be going out into other areas of Virginia
and into other states to be the leaders of those communities.  This art education can ensure that we these
children will be better prepared for their futures and leading our states and
our country in years to come.  <br/></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Your
contribution is essential to our being able to increase advertising into areas
outside our region so that more people will attend Art on the Lawn, purchase
more art from our fine artists and bring more tourism dollars into Giles County
and the surrounding communities.  It's all about county sustainability!  As
people travel on their way to Giles County they may pass through your community,
stop for gasoline, to eat, to spend a night – bringing tourism dollars to your
community as well.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Each year the artists who apply and come to
present their artwork at Art on the Lawn has increased, as has the quality of artwork.  Four years ago we added the Kids Art Adventure, and the popularity of Art on the Lawn increased
again.  Part of our success can be
attributed to our volunteer teams.  From
the time the artists begin to arrive on site at 7 a.m., volunteers
assist them in moving their display supplies and artwork to their assigned
sites.  They assist in set up as
well - something unique to art shows.  During the day volunteers are
there to meet the artists’ every need. 
Then at the end of the day they are there to assist in tear down and
getting things back to the artists’ vehicles. 
Artists feel appreciated and appreciative.  All our surveys have commented extensively
about our wonderful volunteers and the friendly, supportive people of Giles County.  <br/></span></span></p>

<h3>The Arts Scene Takes Note....</h3>In 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 Virginia Living

around since 1948 and 1958 respectively.

<p><span>Art on the Lawn’s biggest challenge is funding.<span>  Last year, due to the impending shut down of
Appalachian Power Company’s local power plant, we lost an annual $1000
sponsorship.  The local bank with whom we
started this event merged with another bank who no longer wishes to to contribute as a sponsor.  A double-edged sword, if you will, also arose when the County Tourism Office hired its new Director of Tourism, and funds originally earmarked for its sponsorship program were redirected - a loss of $1000 for our budget.  This is a small community with no large businesses
to make up the lost sponsorship money.  Money that would have been used for
advertising and supporting Kids Art Adventure. We have to find other means to
support this wonderful event. Other funding is used for other advertising such
as roadside banners, poster printing, call to artist post card, postage; awards
(both cash and ribbons); day-long entertainment; office supplies;
water, soft drinks and snacks provided for artists, their assistants, and our
volunteers for the day. In other words, all the overhead expenses that go

<p><span>To date, Giles Arts Council has applied for a grant from the

Local industries and businesses have been approached for sponsorship
dollars as well.  Local individuals passionate about the arts and their community have been generous with their financial support of Art on the Lawn as well.  We will continue to search for
other outlets of support. Each member of the Art on the Lawn organizing
committee has a specific role to play in seeking ways to support their part of
the event.  One member, who has a banking
background and the contacts that go with that, is approaching larger
corporations outside Giles County for support at budget-making time. 
That would include hospital corporations, banks, finance companies,
manufacturers to name a few.  Indiegogo
is another way we feel we can reach out to like-minded individuals for support
in promotion of the arts through Art on the Lawn.</span></span></p>

El primer taller es para reunir y compartir historias de nuestras ancestras. Como por ejemplo la de Otim, Orixà transexual o el romance de Yansã y Oxum. El segundo es sobre metodologías feministas de resolución de conflictos en contextos interraciales y/o lgbtqueer. El tercero será un taller abierto de capoeira angola LesboTransFeminista.

En el primer taller queremos trabajar sobre los mitos de lxs orixas, voduns, inquices y encantadas que se consideran ""desviadas""; dar un pequeño repaso en nuestra ancestralidad. Vamos a grabar esas historias contadas por las personas. 
En el segundo taller vamos a sentir/pensar cómo usar las críticas para fortalecer nuestras comunidades, sin destruirlas. ¿Como hacer/recibir criticas con más cuidado? ¿De que otras formas tenemos que resolvernos, además de silenciandonos, denunciando los cotilleos venenosos, rupturas drásticas y grupitos? Vamos intercambiar ideas y estrategias de autocuidado.
El tercer taller pretende hacer una vivencia y práctica de auto defensa, danza, juegos y canciones de la ancestralidad negra con instrumientos musicales afrobasileños. Afirmando una conexión entre lésbicas, trans e inter, negrxs y racializadxs, con el objetivo de desconstruir las relaciones de poder y jerarquias, construyendo empoderamientos sapatão(camionera), feminista y transfeminista.
   Lo que necesitamos 
Necesitamos dinero para logra llegrar a Berlín al encuentro-festival.
Cada pasaje de ida y vuelta sale R$ 4.000 (REAIS brasileiro) o € 1.200 (USD Dollar) o $1.345 (Euros).
Además de esta campaña contamos con amigos que esperan poder recaudar fondos a través de fiestas.
 El impacto
 Nuestro proyeto es importante para nosotras y para lxs lgbtqueer negrxs en la diaspora, para intercambiarmos saberes ancestrales y fortalecernos dentro y fuera de nuestras comunidades.
El taller de capoeira feminista en el Encuentro Lesbico Feminista Latinoamericano y Caribeño, puedo darnos confianza y fuerza para hacer lo que pretendemos alla, en Berlin.
Lo que hacemos como colectiva día a día rescata nuestras historias y ancestralidades que se han intentado borrar de diversas formas en la historia, desde las mas crueles y evidentes a la invisibilización silenciosa. Rescatamos el trabajo y la esperitualidad desde una perspectiva negra, lésbica, trans y feminista, como manera de rescate y de roptura de opresión, usando el arte como herramienta expresiva. Eso es lo que queremos compartir, no sólo en el Festival, pero es ahí donde tendremos la oportunidad de encontrarnos con otrxs que repliquen estos conocimientos en sus propias comunidades, a la vez que aprenderemos de lxs otrxs sus experiencias ancestrales.

 Otras formas en las que puedes ayudar
 Sabemos que no todxs pueden ayudar donando dinero, pero eso no significa que no puedan colaborar. Ayúdanos difundiendo la campaña en tu mural y en los murales de tus amistades, en listas de e-mail, Ongs, en los grupos feministas autónomos y antiracistas.
Y deseándonos Axè y buena vibra para que todo salga bien!

</h3><p><b></b></p><p><b>Who are we?</b></p>
<p>We are the Seed Group: an
ensemble of NYC-based individuals from various professional, artistic, and
cultural backgrounds. We were brought together in a project of the Open Program
of the Workcenter of Jerzy Grotowski and Thomas Richards. Most of us met and
worked with the Open Program for the first time earlier this year, while some
of us have already had a long-standing relationship with the Workcenter. Their
work moved us and made us move, shaping our collaboration toward a long-term
project in the USA: the NYC Revival Dream.</p>
<p><b>What is the Open Program?</b></p>
<p>The Open Program is one of two
teams currently active at the Workcenter (Pontedera, Italy): a center for
research into the actor’s craft that is of truly world-wide significance. The
living legacy of the Workcenter's world-renown founder, a major figure in 20th
century theatre theory and practice, Jerzy Grotowski, is research in the area
of Art as vehicle: the actor's work on him/herself. The Open Program's current
work seeks to bridge this ongoing research to wider social realities—meeting,
interacting and working with local communities through different kinds of
performative works and practices. Seeking to discover the nucleus of theatre and
performance, the moment of a meaningful contact between human beings on a
common ground beyond cultural and other perceived differences, the Open Program
is asking: what can the elements of culture in the shared<i>work </i>of our
artistic craft be a vehicle
for in the context of a community and between communities? What are its
intrinsic and social potentialities? How can a theatre piece, a concert, a
feast, a holiday, provide a common ground for contact and transformation of
perception? </p>
<p>Since its inception, 29 years
ago, the Workcenter's praxis and research has been articulated from the
practical basis of a research on ancient songs of the African and
Afro-Caribbean diaspora. For 7 of those years, the Open Program, a team of
international performers directed by Mario Biagini, has been tracing a new
branch of this research: an in-depth exploration of old African-American songs
of the U.S. South and of different forms of artistic creation and event, as
vehicles for contact and meeting. This is a search for artistic competences and
uniquely articulated capacities of meaningful interaction within and between
communities, based on the recognition of unique individual as well as shared cultural
resources.</p>
<p><b>What are we doing?</b></p>
<p>In the winter of 2014, the Open
Program launched a completely self-produced two-month program of performances,
workshops, and meetings in NYC, reaching out to various individuals and communities
throughout the city. They initiated weekly Open Choir sessions at West Park
Presbyterian Church: meetings open to all, where people could explore the work
on songs by direct participation. The Seed Group emerged out of this larger
fluid group, unified by the desire to continue exploring these songs and to
sustain the work of the Open Choir. Since the formation of the group, with the
continued long-distance mentorship of the Open Program, the Seed Group has been
meeting weekly at West Park Presbyterian, as well as in smaller groups, to
pursue the work of rehearsing and researching together.</p>
<p><b>What are we raising funds for?</b></p>
<p>Continuing to work in collaboration
with the Open Program to develop our practice and to reinstate and sustain the
weekly Open Choirs, our wish is to create a space for the possibility of a
meeting based on artistic and human values beyond all perceived boundaries or dislocations.</p>
<p>We have initiated this campaign
to raise funds to bring the director of the Open Program, Mario Biagini, along
with three members of the team, back to NYC for four weeks in June and July
2014. With their guidance we will continue to refine our work, thus creating the
basis for a sustainable and mutually nurturing practice among ourselves and
alongside local communities. During this visit of the Open Program, we will
also begin to explore and implement various Seed Group proposals toward the long-term
project. This month-long work together will culminate in a two-day Symposium,
hosted at West Park Presbyterian, featuring both practical and discursive
explorations of the function of song in artistic and community practices.</p>
<p>The funds raised through this
campaign will go toward the flights and accommodation of the four Open Program
members for the duration of this work in NYC. In addition to monetary
contributions, we are also gratefully accepting in-kind donations for the
accommodations of these four international artists in NYC.</p>
<p><b>What’s in it for you?</b></p>
<p>Ever since our initial encounter
with them, we have found that the work done by the Open Program with these
songs has the potential to reveal creative forces and capacities, and to develop
competencies that can help us to interact in new ways with our surroundings,
touching upon the richness and depth of humanity that lies within each of us. This
work can transform, nourish, and empower ourselves and others. </p>
<p>By contributing to this
campaign, you are helping our effort to keep this creative power alive, by
perfecting our artistic craft as a tool for human communion. Our incentives
(listed below) are merely a small way of signaling our gratitude, and range
from public thank you’s on social media outlets, to a private performance of
the Open Program for you and your friends. We hope that, whatever you can
contribute monetarily to this project, you will come to witness this work
first-hand as it continues to grow and develop over the coming months in NYC.
In the end, your most important contribution is your acceptance of our invitation to participate in this process directly. We
will be most happy to see you at the next Open Choir, at our Symposium, or to
meet you soon wherever in the world you may be! </p>

<h3>Breve reseña</h3>Ayer un incidente puso patas arriba nuestra vida: se rompió el pestillo de la puerta del despacho y nuestra privacidad nos fue arrebatada. El resultado es que para poder abandonar el despacho tuvimos que forzar la puerta, quedando como se puede ver en las imágenes. <br/><br/>Este proyecto trata de recuperar la privacidad de un espacio. De restituir una puerta que simboliza el resguardo que toda persona desea tener. Las puertas nos protegen, las puertas nos otorgan privacidad, las puertas nos otorgan seguridad. Vivimos en un mundo donde la privacidad, la seguridad y la protección del individuo cada día son amenazadas. <br/><br/>Este es un proyecto para recordar a todos la importancia de estos valores a través de la sustitución de una puerta rota. Cambiemos esta puerta para empezar a cambiar el mundo.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes</h3> <ul>
<li>La financiación irá íntegramente destinada a la adquisición y montaje de una nueva puerta en el despacho por manos de un experto de reconocido prestigio en el ámbito del montaje y sustitución de puertas en viviendas y otros espacios, el popular artista de la madera ""<span>inhabitants</span>"". El coste del proyecto incluye su desplazamiento y manutención.<br/>
</li> <li>Las recompensas serán amplias y variadas para todos los colaboradores.<br/>
</li> <li>En caso de no lograr el objetivo los fondos serán destinados a sustituir la puerta poniendo dinero de nuestro bolsillo.<br/>
</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>El impacto</h3> <ul>
<li>Esta campaña es un proyecto único e innovador en el mundo. Nadie hasta la fecha ha tratado de esta forma la importancia de la privacidad en la vida de las personas. <br/>
</li> <li>El personal que participa en la ejecución de este proyecto cuenta con amplia y dilatada experiencia, con más de 10 años de experiencia individual y más de 50 años de experiencia conjunta. <br/>
</li> <li>Este proyecto no es un bluff, puedes ver el estado en el que ha quedado la puerta y podrás ver cómo queda una vez se coloque una puerta nueva.<br/>

</div></div>","Breve reseñaAyer un incidente puso patas arriba nuestra vida: se rompió el pestillo de la puerta del despacho y nuestra privacidad nos fue arrebatada. El resultado es que para poder abandonar el despacho tuvimos que forzar la puerta, quedando como se puede ver en las imágenes. Este proyecto trata de recuperar la privacidad de un espacio. De restituir una puerta que simboliza el resguardo que toda persona desea tener. Las puertas nos protegen, las puertas nos otorgan privacidad, las puertas nos otorgan seguridad. Vivimos en un mundo donde la privacidad, la seguridad y la protección del individuo cada día son amenazadas. Este es un proyecto para recordar a todos la importancia de estos valores a través de la sustitución de una puerta rota. Cambiemos esta puerta para empezar a cambiar el mundo.
  Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes 
La financiación irá íntegramente destinada a la adquisición y montaje de una nueva puerta en el despacho por manos de un experto de reconocido prestigio en el ámbito del montaje y sustitución de puertas en viviendas y otros espacios, el popular artista de la madera ""inhabitants"". El coste del proyecto incluye su desplazamiento y manutención.
 Las recompensas serán amplias y variadas para todos los colaboradores.
 En caso de no lograr el objetivo los fondos serán destinados a sustituir la puerta poniendo dinero de nuestro bolsillo.
 
  El impacto 
Esta campaña es un proyecto único e innovador en el mundo. Nadie hasta la fecha ha tratado de esta forma la importancia de la privacidad en la vida de las personas. 
 El personal que participa en la ejecución de este proyecto cuenta con amplia y dilatada experiencia, con más de 10 años de experiencia individual y más de 50 años de experiencia conjunta. 
 Este proyecto no es un bluff, puedes ver el estado en el que ha quedado la puerta y podrás ver cómo queda una vez se coloque una puerta nueva.
 
  Riesgos y desafíos El principal desafío de este proyecto es encontrar la financiación adecuada que permita la correcta adquisición y montaje de una nueva puerta. Contamos con la colaboración de personal experto en el proyecto (http://www.meneame.net/user/habitante) que garantiza al 100% el cumplimiento del proyecto en caso de éxito de la financiación.

<p><strong>Reflections Without Reservations</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Nathaniel Bartels, Nate to my friends.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My upcoming book is based off of personal observations, contemplation, deliberations along with much study and research. The book has been many years in the making. The book explores an entirely different path of self-improvement. Instead of the mainstream position of positivity which currently dominates self-improvement, I've focused my research and writing on striking a life balance, developing tenacity and resilience, pursuing contentment and living your life realistically.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>About Me</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am a writer who is (hopefully) achieving his life ambition of publishing his first book. Currently, my Bruce Wayne / Clark Kent alter-ego, day job is working for the United States Postal Service as a mail carrier in Massachusetts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>About the Project</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This first book is the end result of over a decade of research, contemplation and personal observation. Much of my personal experiences with PTSD and Asperger's Syndrome are used throughout the book. This is the first of many books I am planning, and I am currently writing a second book to release hopefully in Spring 2017.  Considering my book is nearly finished, almost all of my research needs have already been met without significant financial penalty.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What remains, however, are publishing and production costs which I cannot meet on my own.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My goal is $3,700 which breaks down into the following:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>$1,200 for Amazon self-publishing costs (formatting the manuscript to paperback and ebook, releasing book in both paperback and ebook simultaneously, etc.)</p>
<p>$1,200 for editing and assembly costs (including book cover and back from a graphic illustrator and paying for an editor)</p>
<p>$1,300 for marketing costs (printed books for the perks of donating, and publicity campaigns on Facebook, other marketing ideas, etc.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My goal is to have the book published and available in the next three months.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What You Get For Donating</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Firstly, if you’re willing to donate at least $30, there will be a limited production run of 100 signed copies of the copy made available after book release to be shipped anywhere in the world to you as my thanks for your help in reaching my goal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lastly, for those who who donate $50 or more, ten perks will be available, to not only send you an autographed copy of the book, but also put your name in the acknowledgements of my published book as thanks for giving towards my book being published.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><i>(Note, the books will be sent once the book is published, this will be after the book is fully edited, formatted and posted for release on Amazon, estimated as being by the end of December 2016.)</i></u></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why This Project is Important</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I feel as though a significant majority of people are not served by the current trend of positivity and positive thinking in self-improvement.  I’ve interviewed countless people and they would be interested in a self-improvement book which teaches balance, encourages contentment and above all, living your life realistically.  That’s what self-improvement should be about - looking at your life critically and realistically, not just self-validation.  After all, which would you rather have when you’re at a crossroads in your own life - something that tells you not to question yourself or a helpful suggestion that maybe your life isn’t working as well as you’d hoped and therein a pathway towards getting your life towards balance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have Asperger’s Syndrome and PTSD, either of which alone can be difficult, let alone debilitating, but having both has not only been life altering for me, and I want to give back to the world by offering my perspective and my own hard-won life lessons and personal observations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I know that I am asking a lot of those who don't know me. My lifelong dream has been to publish a book, and I decided my first book will be on self-improvement as I believe my unique perspective will offer much to those not only with Asperger's Syndrome and PTSD, but much of society as well. I also feel that the book will change the perspective of society towards those on the Autism Spectrum.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Please Help!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you are unable to contribute financially, please spread this campaign around to any interested parties. Use any and all share tools!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I already have a Facebook page up which I update frequently with my progress.</p>

<h3>Introduction &amp; Summary</h3>
<p><span>This project aims to use the art of bodypainting to break down stereotypes and misconceptions about people with eating disorders, destigmatizing both the art form and the illness. </span></p>
<p><span>My name is Jessica Mellow, and I am a face painter, bodypainter, FX makeup artist, and bodypaint model based in NYC. I also have a history of severe eating disorders, which have manifested in nearly every form. While this monopolized my life for several years, making me believe it defined me, finding passion in art was a catalyst for change.  Though it is still a part of my life, the grip has loosened and allowed me to gain my life back and find an inner joy beyond what I thought possible.</span></p>
<p>February is Eating Disorders Awareness Month, so I figured it would be an ideal time to move forward with a project I've been contemplating for nearly two years. It is an issue I care deeply about, as it nearly killed me, and I've lost multiple friends to their own battles. My goal is to bodypaint a wide variety of people with eating disorders, using body art to help them express themselves.  This will allow them to tell their stories in a way that can help educate others, and break down misconceptions and stereotypes about those with EDs.  I will not exploit or dramatize anyone's experience or images, and body shape/size will NOT be the focus of the project. The comfort and well-being of the subjects will be the highest priority, and they will have final approval over their published photographs. The finished product will be a book with the images printed alongside each person's story.  In the meantime, you can follow the progress online. </p>
<p> The initial inspiration for this project is drawn from my first time as a human canvas (painted by a fellow painter and friend, Margie Nugent). It was for a short transformational video created by James Anthony McElligott, in which the bodypainting process is used as a way to show growth, healing, and bonding, fueled by the narration from our interviews and visualized through one of the most interactive and beautiful forms of art.  More about this particular project, my story, and the link to the video can be found here, in this note I wrote when the video was initially released in December 2010:</p>
<p><strong><a href=""http://tinyurl.com/bsqz293"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Personal Backstory and Healing: Behind the Paint"">http://tinyurl.com/bsqz293</a></strong></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><strong>Where will the money go?</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>One of the first things I need to purchase is a professional level DSLR, as well as lenses and basic equipment.  I would like to do most of the photography myself, given the sensitive nature of the project, in order to keep the participants of the project as comfortable as possible.  However, throughout the process I will welcome assistance from other photographers, artists, editors, and graphic designers.  Any collaborators will be credited. </p>
<p>The bulk of the funds will be used for travel, which will allow me to include people who wish to participate, but live further away.  Adding an international aspect will help in my goal of portraying the widest variety of people and stories possible, and allow me to show how eating disorders are experienced and perceived in other cultures. </p>
<p>Though not the highest priority, an iPad would be helpful as a traveling portfolio, as well as to keep all aspects of the project organized and easily accessible at any time, anywhere.</p>
<p>Funding would also go toward costs of setting up and maintaining a website, and supplies such as paints, a new brush set, props, and accessories.  The paints I use are all FDA cosmetic compliant, made specifically for the skin.  I do not use any products on others that I do not use on myself, because one of the most important elements of this project is mutual trust and respect between the painter and model.  </p>
<p>Finally, once I have enough material, I will need to figure out the logistics of printing and publishing the finished product.  </p>
<p>All funds raised will be allocated to the project. In the meantime, I will continue pursuing freelance work to support myself, as I still have student loans, medical bills, rent, utilities, and other bills to pay.  Therefore, every little bit contributed will be immensely appreciated.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What do I hope to acheive? </h3>
<p>I want to bring awareness, understanding, and a new way of looking at an often stigmatized or glamorized illness through a form of art that may be viewed as somewhat controversial in the context. I want to educate people and make steps in eliminating stereotypes.  The constant misrepresentation of eating disorders which portray them as the result of extreme vanity, or a diet gone wrong, is dangerous. Those who are not educated about EDs still often group everyone with the label into one box.

</div></div>","Introduction & Summary
This project aims to use the art of bodypainting to break down stereotypes and misconceptions about people with eating disorders, destigmatizing both the art form and the illness. 
My name is Jessica Mellow, and I am a face painter, bodypainter, FX makeup artist, and bodypaint model based in NYC. I also have a history of severe eating disorders, which have manifested in nearly every form. While this monopolized my life for several years, making me believe it defined me, finding passion in art was a catalyst for change.  Though it is still a part of my life, the grip has loosened and allowed me to gain my life back and find an inner joy beyond what I thought possible.
February is Eating Disorders Awareness Month, so I figured it would be an ideal time to move forward with a project I've been contemplating for nearly two years. It is an issue I care deeply about, as it nearly killed me, and I've lost multiple friends to their own battles. My goal is to bodypaint a wide variety of people with eating disorders, using body art to help them express themselves.  This will allow them to tell their stories in a way that can help educate others, and break down misconceptions and stereotypes about those with EDs.  I will not exploit or dramatize anyone's experience or images, and body shape/size will NOT be the focus of the project. The comfort and well-being of the subjects will be the highest priority, and they will have final approval over their published photographs. The finished product will be a book with the images printed alongside each person's story.  In the meantime, you can follow the progress online. 
 The initial inspiration for this project is drawn from my first time as a human canvas (painted by a fellow painter and friend, Margie Nugent). It was for a short transformational video created by James Anthony McElligott, in which the bodypainting process is used as a way to show growth, healing, and bonding, fueled by the narration from our interviews and visualized through one of the most interactive and beautiful forms of art.  More about this particular project, my story, and the link to the video can be found here, in this note I wrote when the video was initially released in December 2010:
http://tinyurl.com/bsqz293
 
Where will the money go?


One of the first things I need to purchase is a professional level DSLR, as well as lenses and basic equipment.  I would like to do most of the photography myself, given the sensitive nature of the project, in order to keep the participants of the project as comfortable as possible.  However, throughout the process I will welcome assistance from other photographers, artists, editors, and graphic designers.  Any collaborators will be credited. 
The bulk of the funds will be used for travel, which will allow me to include people who wish to participate, but live further away.  Adding an international aspect will help in my goal of portraying the widest variety of people and stories possible, and allow me to show how eating disorders are experienced and perceived in other cultures. 
Though not the highest priority, an iPad would be helpful as a traveling portfolio, as well as to keep all aspects of the project organized and easily accessible at any time, anywhere.
Funding would also go toward costs of setting up and maintaining a website, and supplies such as paints, a new brush set, props, and accessories.  The paints I use are all FDA cosmetic compliant, made specifically for the skin.  I do not use any products on others that I do not use on myself, because one of the most important elements of this project is mutual trust and respect between the painter and model.  
Finally, once I have enough material, I will need to figure out the logistics of printing and publishing the finished product.  
All funds raised will be allocated to the project. In the meantime, I will continue pursuing freelance work to support myself, as I still have student loans, medical bills, rent, utilities, and other bills to pay.  Therefore, every little bit contributed will be immensely appreciated.


What do I hope to acheive? 
I want to bring awareness, understanding, and a new way of looking at an often stigmatized or glamorized illness through a form of art that may be viewed as somewhat controversial in the context. I want to educate people and make steps in eliminating stereotypes.  The constant misrepresentation of eating disorders which portray them as the result of extreme vanity, or a diet gone wrong, is dangerous. Those who are not educated about EDs still often group everyone with the label into one box. Worse, they group only those with a certain set of symptoms or a certain appearance into a box and end up overlooking the majority of people suffering from EDs. Mental illness is blind to color/class/age, but the stereotypes keep people who don’t fit the mold from seeking much-needed help. 
I will represent people across the spectrum in all aspects including age, race, class, culture, gender, profession, and manifestation of the illness (anorexia, bulimia, binge eating, compulsive overeating, night eating syndrome, exercise bulimia, diabulimia, pica, bigorexia, EDNOS), past or present.
As bodypaint still carries somewhat of a stigma itself, I hope that combining these two elements will help reduce that stigma, show people a way to see the human body as a work of art in itself, open up dialogue, and even help reduce the body-shaming that is so prevalent in today's society.
Most of all, I want to foster hope.  Hope for recovery, and hope for life, because life is really a beautiful thing.

Technology makes it possible for us to crank out digital copies of an artist's work in the same amount of time it takes to make a sandwich.
But for discerning artists, collectors, and appreciators of art, there is no replacement for the centuries-old craft of hand printing, whether it be lithography, woodcut or etchings. 
Call lithography a ""dying art"" if you must, but those who understand printmaking value the hours of labor and craft that go into a fine, hand-printed edition of an artist's original works.

There is no button pushing. There are no shortcuts. The outcome is breathtaking.


Fine art lithography in particular is an intimate conversation between artist and printer, stone and paper, light and color. It is laborious and complex and worth waiting for. 


My name is Aaron Shipps, and I'm a collaborative, fine art printer. I've worked hard at my craft (first at the world-renowned Tamarind Institute, and most recently at the Lawrence Lithography Workshop), and I'm proud to have had work I've printed displayed in venues such as The Smithsonian, MOMA, The Nelson Atkins, and much more. My commitment to my life's work could fairly be called ""obsessional,"" and it's my hope that it shows in the prints that I make.



""Aaron is a superbly skilled lithographer and a dream to work and collaborate with. When I was working on a lithographic print at Tamarind and there were some slow times for me, Aaron talked me into collaborating on a series of offset lithographs and it was one of the most wonderful and valuable impromptu projects I have done. Aaron was very encouraging, great listener, and worked like a fiend. I cannot recommend him more strongly—he truly is the master of his work.""

-Tanja Softić, Professor of Art, University of Richmond




Armed with a strong desire to approach printmaking in a fresh, innovative way, I'm opening a new fine art print shop, Bedrock Art Editions, LLC, in Kansas City's Crossroads Arts District.


It's my desire to realize vibrant new works by contemporary artists using innovative twists of these old print mediums. And because my doors are open to all artists, I envision the shop as a creative asset and curious destination for the community at large.
 Here's what's already in place:


With the sale of my printers proofs, the generosity of supportive friends and family like Mike Lyon, Ben Worth, Dave and Nancy Shipps, Joe Valley, Aimee Eckhardt, Cheri LeBlond, and so many more—plus the fastidious squirreling away of every last available penny— the following is already in place:

A large, motor-driven lithography press
An exposure unit
Chemicals, solvents, and A LOT of misc. materials
A full array of drawing supplies and artists tools
Specialized shop tables and furniture
A BEAUTIFUL studio space secured down town in Kansas City's Crossroads Arts District (shown below)




Some exciting projects are already lining up, including an ambitious 100-color lithograph with Kansas City artist, Laura Berman. To put that into perspective for the layperson, an average litho today is made of about 5-6 colors. Below is Laura's sketch of this incredible project.


 
Though we're close to opening the doors, we've still got some critical needs:



Lithography Stones: $1,950


Papers: $2,130


Inks: $1,588 


Printing Plates: $3,044 


Rollers: $2,077 FULLY FUNDED!


Scraper bars for the press, tympyns, gum arabic, etc.: $3,214 FULLY FUNDED!


Remaining shop buildout: $1,000 FULLY FUNDED!


TOTAL: $15,000

We are interested in showing: objects, sculptures, installation, video, and performance work. Some themes which overlap between all of our works include heritage, personal history, body and object interaction, and hybridity of forms. 

As students, we have to make this happen on our own without funding from our institution.     Risks & Challenges A part of our requirements for the class this year is to find a place in which to host our show. If we don't raise the money and book a show, we won't meet the requirements to complete the course!
    Other Ways You Can Help If you can't contribute financially, that doesn't mean you can't help!  Please tell your friends and family about us. You can share this indiegogo mission to your social media account.   And that's all there is to it.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

They're incredibly talented, they're innovative, they're at the top of their field, and they happen to live in Cuba. (They're also exceptionally nice people.)Thanks to a grant from Pratt Institute, we traveled to Cuba to research how graphic design is used in a country that does not allow commercial advertising. While there, we met with the top graphic designers and we were amazed. We learned about their process and their lives. We found that while they create some of the most impressive art we have seen- vibrant, bold, with incredible use of color, composition and typography- they do all of this with extremely limited supplies. Sometimes they have to redesign their pieces because they can't get the paints. They work at a printing press where the machines are literally 100 years old. And they don't have access to things that we take for granted: art journals, design catalogs, and high speed internet access to view images online.We naively realized that there is no Blicks, no Utrecht, no four floors of Pearl Paint that they can wander.

</strong><p><strong></strong>
</p><p><strong>Nomadic Arts
Festival</strong> is an experimental festival focusing on diversity,
connectivity and community, through performance work and creative expression.
Its nomadic nature encourages mobility, both geographically and in its form.
Therefore the festival changes shape and is set in a different location each
year. Each cultural, social and ecological context of every festival site
shape the creative and artistic theme of each festival – attempting to create
a mobile community of sharing, creativity, research, exploration and fluidity.</p><p>
</p><p>This year the festival will take place in two locations in
Poland: Warsaw and Charciabałda. The latter is more specifically an “off-grid”
farm, in north-east Poland, located at an old wheat field, set between pine
forests, of which the 2014 festival has taken its name and theme.<br/><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/556448/files/20140504131729-IMG_0212_Smaller.jpg?1399234649"" src="""" style=""width: 338.773px; height: 255px;""/></p>
<p>The festival at Charciabałda, will therefore be a two day

raise money and make Nomadic Arts Festival the best it can be. We need your help to
reach our target of €2000 (and beyond!) in order to cover the last basic
expenses of the festival:<br/><p><br/>-Festival materials        <br/>
-Documentation<br/>
-Transportation to and from Warsaw and the festival site<br/><br/>But we hope to raise more!</p>
<p><b>This is why</b>:<br/><br/>
The festival is run voluntarily and we have done our best to keep our costs as
low as possible, yet we feel we have a responsibility towards the artists who
are presenting work at the festival. So far we have only been able to cover their
travel costs, which means that all the artists are working voluntarily, which
warms our hearts, as it means that they believe in the ethos and ideas behind the
festival. Though as an organisation we do feel committed to make the best
attempt in supporting the artists, both artistically and financially. The money
we raise during this campaign, which exceeds our target, will therefore go
exclusively to the artists presenting work at the festival - divided equally
between them.
</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>
<br/>Background and Ethos<br/>
</h3><p>
</p><p><b>‘the nomad is a […]
intensive, multiple entity, <br/>
functioning in a net of interconnections […] <br/>
the site of multiple connections.’<br/><br/>
-Rosi Braidotti (Nomadic Subject)</b><br/></p><p>The festival has grown out of an ecological desire to use
the realm of the arts for research, sharing and creativity, whereby to explore
and draw focus to the specificities of local, cultural and geographical
contexts. Similarly being nomadic by nature, the festival also puts an emphasis
on creating intercultural and transnational communities. Focusing on sharing as
a key ethos for learning, developing and exploring, the festival therefore aims
to set up temporary communities throughout the world, where connections,
relation and exchanges are facilitated.</p><p>The artists are the backbone of the festival and it is them who offers 
the opportunity for people to get together. Their sharing of research 
and explorations gives colours to the festival, but furthermore create a
 scope into the theme each festival presents, as a body of research of 
that theme, which will culminate in a documentation of the festival. So 
the festival both have an emphasis as an arts festival celebrating 
cultures, communities and the value of Live Art, but also functions as 
an exploration and research into themes, as an aim to shed new light on 
human and ecological conditions and issues of living in our contemporary world.<br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Partners and Associates<br/><br/>

The army burned him down. My mother was dried. and me...http://wiryabudaghi.wordpress.comSupi (Oxford, England) with THE EARTH’S EMBRACE  (Ancient Burial Ritual)www.suepennington.comAND THERE ARE MORE ARTISTS YET TO COME!OUR TARGETWe have created this campaign to ask for your support to
raise money and make Nomadic Arts Festival the best it can be. We need your help to
reach our target of €2000 (and beyond!) in order to cover the last basic
expenses of the festival:-Festival materials        
-Documentation
-Transportation to and from Warsaw and the festival siteBut we hope to raise more!
This is why:
The festival is run voluntarily and we have done our best to keep our costs as
low as possible, yet we feel we have a responsibility towards the artists who
are presenting work at the festival. So far we have only been able to cover their
travel costs, which means that all the artists are working voluntarily, which
warms our hearts, as it means that they believe in the ethos and ideas behind the
festival. Though as an organisation we do feel committed to make the best
attempt in supporting the artists, both artistically and financially. The money
we raise during this campaign, which exceeds our target, will therefore go
exclusively to the artists presenting work at the festival - divided equally
between them.

Background and Ethos

‘the nomad is a […]
intensive, multiple entity, 
functioning in a net of interconnections […] 
the site of multiple connections.’
-Rosi Braidotti (Nomadic Subject)The festival has grown out of an ecological desire to use
the realm of the arts for research, sharing and creativity, whereby to explore
and draw focus to the specificities of local, cultural and geographical
contexts. Similarly being nomadic by nature, the festival also puts an emphasis
on creating intercultural and transnational communities. Focusing on sharing as
a key ethos for learning, developing and exploring, the festival therefore aims
to set up temporary communities throughout the world, where connections,
relation and exchanges are facilitated.The artists are the backbone of the festival and it is them who offers 
the opportunity for people to get together. Their sharing of research 
and explorations gives colours to the festival, but furthermore create a
 scope into the theme each festival presents, as a body of research of 
that theme, which will culminate in a documentation of the festival. So 
the festival both have an emphasis as an arts festival celebrating 
cultures, communities and the value of Live Art, but also functions as 
an exploration and research into themes, as an aim to shed new light on 
human and ecological conditions and issues of living in our contemporary world.Other Partners and Associates

I will be filling the entire gallery by myself and will be doing so with 12-15 pictures. Each photo is going to be it's own unique scenario and will be printed and framed at 4' x 5' (really large). I will be printing them myself on a large-format printer, building my own frames, and basically doing all the labor and setup myself.

<p>Hola! Gabriel San Roman and Carla Zarate have
joined forces as co-creators of the Subversive Historian’s 2015 ‘Calendar of
Revolt’ project! We have undertaken this endeavor to present a new way of
highlighting history in an accessible manner. The “Subversive Historian” morphs
from its origin as a daily radio segment as heard for years on KPFK-Pacifica
Radio in Los Angeles into 12-months of radical history! The ‘Calendar of
Revolt’ combines the rebellious spirit of slingshot pocket organizers with an
artistic aesthetic that a calendar brings while providing historical quotes
of inspiration. It focuses on the emancipation struggles of workers,
radicals, women, people of color, and the LGBT community throughout the history
of the United States and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Gabriel San Roman is the “Subversive Historian”
and also multimedia journalist whose work has been featured on KPFK Radio and
in the pages of OC Weekly, ZMagazine, and online at Truth Out in addition to
numerous other outlets. He’s also the author of “Venceremos:
Victor Jara and the New Song Movement” published by PM Press. </p>
<p>Carla Zarate is the designer of the ‘Calendar of
Revolt.’ Originally from Mexicali, Mexico, she was a producer, camera woman and
documentary directory before becoming a part of SolArt Gallery, a collective
promoting solidarity through ALL the arts in Santa Ana CA. Since then, Zarate’s
been busy creating graphic design for non-profit organizations, documenting the
Latin Alternative music scene, producing videos, collaborating with artists on
public art. </p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Subversive Historian’s 2015 ‘Calendar of
Revolt’ holds faithful to its mission of providing daily histories that have
otherwise remained “mysteries.” It's a rhyming nod to the fact that obscuring stories of injustice and resistance to it in the United States and beyond
frames establishment history. This has been on display in Tucson, Arizona and Texas before it where critical literature has been banned in the former and textbooks have been subject to ideological
revisions in the latter. To hell with that, we say!<br/></p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>This campaign is primarily aimed at covering the printing costs for the Calendar of Revolt. Carla and Gabriel will be collaborating with socially conscious printers and distributors in making the world a more righteous place. What do you get? Aside from the knowledge and inspiration rulers 'round the world would rather you not have, check out our pledge level perks! <br/></p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>Friends,

<p>Help
Carla and Gabriel out by promoting our campaign through word of mouth and all
your social networking! Share this page on Facebook. Tweet it. Do whatever you
can. Give whatever you can. Hell, go ahead and tell a reactionary conservative
about our project! All your support is warmly appreciated and we won’t let you
down! And remember: It’s no mystery why they conceal our people’s history!

<b>OUR STORY </b><br/>
</h3><p>
</p><p>We are David Puig
and Manar Moursi, authors of <i>Sidewalk
Salon: 1001 Street Chairs of Cairo</i>, a unique photographic documentation of
original street chair designs that dot the sidewalks of Cairo and create an alternate portrait of the city through their lens.</p>
<p>We first took notice of the street chairs of
Cairo in 2011, walking on Port Said Avenue, which straddles the city from North to South. “A
funny thing about a chair: you hardly ever think it’s <i>there</i>”, the American poet Theodore Roethke once wrote. And yet that
day, all of a sudden, those street chairs were <i>there</i>. Not one or two of them, isolated, but one after the other
creating some kind of invisible thread along the sidewalk. 

</p><p>Repaired, stitched and
embellished, those chairs age graciously despite being constantly on duty
outdoors. The curiosity triggered by these common objects made us
realize how essential they were to the everyday life of people who spend a
considerable amount of time on the sidewalk. We realized we could
understand Cairo and tell some of its stories from the perspective of those
street chairs.<span>  </span></p>
<p>Over the past 3 years we’ve collected more than a 1000
Polaroid images of the street chairs of Cairo as well as interviews with their
owners. We’ve commissioned fiction and poetry inspired by street chairs to
award winning writers from the city. In the past few months we’ve gone through
a rigorous process of selecting and arranging those images in a book
format. We have been working with the very talented Dutch Graphic Designer
Sandra Kassenaar to create the visual identity of our book. Preview the book here: <a href=""http://issuu.com/manarmorsi/docs/sidewalk_salon___preview_395bf2678e4d8b/1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://issuu.com/manarmorsi/docs/sidewalk_salon...</a></p>
<p>We are now almost ready to print <i>Sidewalk Salon: 1001 Street Chairs of Cairo</i>, and you can now join us
on our journey through the streets of Cairo, and wander with us in the alleys
of what we call ""the biggest open-air chair museum of the world."" </p><h3><b>WHAT WE NEED </b></h3><p>
</p><p>Since <i>Sidewalk Salon: 1001 Street Chairs of Cairo</i> is a full-color art book,
its production and printing are expensive. Our goal is to have a
publication of the finest quality available at an affordable price in Egypt and the rest of the world.
We will be co-publishing our book with independent publishers from
Europe and Egypt. Small independent publishers do a great job to give exposure
and to distribute interesting projects like ours but have limited resources for
their production. Your contribution to our campaign goes straight into the
project, to cover final editing, agencies licenses, finalizing
design, printing and shipping costs. With your support, we will be able to
launch a first print edition of at least a thousand copies the book, and you will have your very
own copy, as well as some other exclusive perks from our list!<br/></p><p>For more info, check out the diagram below:</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1243365/files/20150223142407-ProjectTimeline-01.png?1424730247"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">WHAT YOU GET</b></p>

<p></p>
<p>""A
chair is a container that frames the human body presenting its greatness or
fragility. Whether on a throne or stool we are all united in our act of
sitting, resting, or in the pausing of energy. This book is a collective moment
of, a much-needed, stillness and contemplation from a nation that has been in
perpetual motion for over three years. Moving away from the metaphorical chair
of power that dominates Egyptian authoritarianism, it presents portraits of
mundane chairs, as silent commentators, narrating an overlooked but meaningful
aspect of a nation’s urban existence."" <b>Basma Hamdy, Artist, designer and assistant professor at VCU Qatar. Co-author
of <i>Walls of Freedom</i>. </b></p>
<p>“Cairo is a city that rarely runs on straight lines -
instead it's a patchwork quilt of semi-hidden and contested spaces, and you can
find a dusty street chair in every one of them. Manar and David have chosen a
unique and alternative lens through which to explore the capital, and I can't
wait to see the printed book.” <b>Jack Shenker,
Journalist and author currently working on a book exploring Egypt and resistance, to be published by Allen Lane and Penguin in 2015.

 		 	   		  </b> </p>
<p>“<i>Sidewalk Salon</i> is a beautiful collection
of stories presenting fragments of life in Cairo though one of the city's most
ubiquitous inanimate objects, the street chair.” <b>Mohamed El Shahed, Founder and editor, Cairo Observer. </b></p>
<p>“If
you’ve been to Cairo, you've probably wandered by more than a few repurposed,
decrepit, charmingly Frankensteinian street chairs. Moursi and Puig spent years painstakingly documenting, mapping, and carefully curating
these chairs for <i>Sidewalk Salon,</i> a
beautiful ode to these inadvertent objects of art and the denizens who
created them. In
broad terms, the book is a journey through the last few tumultuous years of
Cairo's history; but more specifically it is a tale about Egyptians—their
struggle, passion, humor, and endurance—a story which unfolds as a walking tour
of a fragmented city where conflict is rooted in the movement and reclamation
of public space, the front lines of which are occupied by these fascinating
chairs. This book is evidence that the streets, at least, are still in the hands of the
people.” <b>Yasmin Elayat, New media
artist, interaction designer and technical director at Second Story. </b></p>
<p>“An invaluable
project romanticizing the seemingly mundane, vividly illustrating the intricate
and complex social landscapes of Cairo in the process. Posterity will look
kindly upon the work of Moursi and Puig.” <b>Joobin
Bekhrad, Founder and editor, Reorient.</b></p>
<p>“Manar Moursi and David Puig's <i>Sidewalk Salon </i>engages Cairo through the
ubiquity of its street chairs: each chair tells a unique story, together they
create a complex and quirky portrait of Cairo's public spaces.” <b>Beth Stryker, co-founder CLUSTER (Cairo Lab
for Urban Studies, Training, and Environmental Research)</b><b></b></p>
<p><i>“Sidewalk
Salon</i> is an outstanding documentation of everyday ingenuity
and creative <i>adhocism,</i> as
displayed through a series of chairs, half ready-made and half invented to fit
local and temporal needs of Cairo's citizens. The book showcases not only the
remarkable traits of local craftsmanship, but also the material marks of a
culture in revolt as manifest in urban space.”<b> Lydia Kallipoliti, Assistant professor of architecture at Syracuse
University and principal of EcoRedux Research Network and ANAcycle studio. </b></p>
<p>""An
interesting and unique project I was lucky enough to take part in. This book
documents a side of Cairo life that visitors and residents see every day but
almost never take note of."" <b>Adam Talib,
Assistant professor at the American University of Cairo and literary tr<b>anslator. <br/></b></b></p><p><b><b></b></b></p><h3><b><b><b>PERKS </b></b></b></h3>We've created a reference diagram below with

OUR STORY 

We are David Puig
and Manar Moursi, authors of Sidewalk
Salon: 1001 Street Chairs of Cairo, a unique photographic documentation of
original street chair designs that dot the sidewalks of Cairo and create an alternate portrait of the city through their lens.
We first took notice of the street chairs of
Cairo in 2011, walking on Port Said Avenue, which straddles the city from North to South. “A
funny thing about a chair: you hardly ever think it’s there”, the American poet Theodore Roethke once wrote. And yet that
day, all of a sudden, those street chairs were there. Not one or two of them, isolated, but one after the other
creating some kind of invisible thread along the sidewalk. 

Repaired, stitched and
embellished, those chairs age graciously despite being constantly on duty
outdoors. The curiosity triggered by these common objects made us
realize how essential they were to the everyday life of people who spend a
considerable amount of time on the sidewalk. We realized we could
understand Cairo and tell some of its stories from the perspective of those
street chairs.  
Over the past 3 years we’ve collected more than a 1000
Polaroid images of the street chairs of Cairo as well as interviews with their
owners. We’ve commissioned fiction and poetry inspired by street chairs to
award winning writers from the city. In the past few months we’ve gone through
a rigorous process of selecting and arranging those images in a book
format. We have been working with the very talented Dutch Graphic Designer
Sandra Kassenaar to create the visual identity of our book. Preview the book here: http://issuu.com/manarmorsi/docs/sidewalk_salon...
We are now almost ready to print Sidewalk Salon: 1001 Street Chairs of Cairo, and you can now join us
on our journey through the streets of Cairo, and wander with us in the alleys
of what we call ""the biggest open-air chair museum of the world."" WHAT WE NEED 
Since Sidewalk Salon: 1001 Street Chairs of Cairo is a full-color art book,
its production and printing are expensive. Our goal is to have a
publication of the finest quality available at an affordable price in Egypt and the rest of the world.
We will be co-publishing our book with independent publishers from
Europe and Egypt. Small independent publishers do a great job to give exposure
and to distribute interesting projects like ours but have limited resources for
their production. Your contribution to our campaign goes straight into the
project, to cover final editing, agencies licenses, finalizing
design, printing and shipping costs. With your support, we will be able to
launch a first print edition of at least a thousand copies the book, and you will have your very
own copy, as well as some other exclusive perks from our list!For more info, check out the diagram below:WHAT YOU GET
To
thank you for your help we have prepared some very special perks that you will find in the
right-hand column of this page. Many of our perks have been exclusively
designed for this campaign. We are also offering artworks related to the campaign
by some of our favorite Egyptian and international contemporary artists. No additional fees will be charged for the shipping of the perks. ABOUT US 


David Puig is a diplomat, translator and
publisher from the Dominican Republic. He has worked in France, India and
Egypt. In 2010, he launched Ediciones De a Poco, a publishing house focused on
contemporary literature and art books from the Caribbean region. While in
Delhi, he collaborated with Vislumbres, a literary magazine which brings
together Latin American and Indian writers. His published translations to Spanish
include the novel Les dollars des sables
by Jean-Noel Pancrazi. 


Manar Moursi’s work spans the fields of
architecture, urbanism, design and art. In 2011,
Manar founded Studio Meem (www.studiomeem.me) an interdisciplinary design
studio based in Cairo. In 2014, in recognition of Manar’s
architectural design work for Studio Meem,
she received the ArcVision Women in
Architecture Award. In addition to architecture, Studio Meem’s
practice encompasses product design work. 
In 2012 Studio Meem’s inaugural
product line Off the Gireed, inspired
by everyday street objects in Cairo, was awarded a Red Dot and a Good Design
Award. Further to design work,
Manar has worked on multiple art projects, the latest being a
series of public art installations titled the “Wonder Box”. Her latest
photography exhibition was shown at the Contemporary Image Collective in Cairo.
It traveled regionally as part of a group exhibition titled “Next to Here” -
curated by Constanze Wicke. Manar’s writings on urban
issues have appeared in Thresholds, Lunch,
Magaz and Al Masry El Yowm. Indiegogo campaign video: Aida El KashefMusic for the Indiegogo video: Aya MetwallyWHAT PEOPLE SAY ABOUT OUR PROJECT

""A
chair is a container that frames the human body presenting its greatness or
fragility. Whether on a throne or stool we are all united in our act of
sitting, resting, or in the pausing of energy. This book is a collective moment
of, a much-needed, stillness and contemplation from a nation that has been in
perpetual motion for over three years. Moving away from the metaphorical chair
of power that dominates Egyptian authoritarianism, it presents portraits of
mundane chairs, as silent commentators, narrating an overlooked but meaningful
aspect of a nation’s urban existence."" Basma Hamdy, Artist, designer and assistant professor at VCU Qatar. Co-author
of Walls of Freedom. 
“Cairo is a city that rarely runs on straight lines -
instead it's a patchwork quilt of semi-hidden and contested spaces, and you can
find a dusty street chair in every one of them. Manar and David have chosen a
unique and alternative lens through which to explore the capital, and I can't
wait to see the printed book.” Jack Shenker,
Journalist and author currently working on a book exploring Egypt and resistance, to be published by Allen Lane and Penguin in 2015.

 		 	   		   
“Sidewalk Salon is a beautiful collection
of stories presenting fragments of life in Cairo though one of the city's most
ubiquitous inanimate objects, the street chair.” Mohamed El Shahed, Founder and editor, Cairo Observer. 
“If
you’ve been to Cairo, you've probably wandered by more than a few repurposed,
decrepit, charmingly Frankensteinian street chairs. Moursi and Puig spent years painstakingly documenting, mapping, and carefully curating
these chairs for Sidewalk Salon, a
beautiful ode to these inadvertent objects of art and the denizens who
created them. In
broad terms, the book is a journey through the last few tumultuous years of
Cairo's history; but more specifically it is a tale about Egyptians—their
struggle, passion, humor, and endurance—a story which unfolds as a walking tour
of a fragmented city where conflict is rooted in the movement and reclamation
of public space, the front lines of which are occupied by these fascinating
chairs. This book is evidence that the streets, at least, are still in the hands of the
people.” Yasmin Elayat, New media
artist, interaction designer and technical director at Second Story. 
“An invaluable
project romanticizing the seemingly mundane, vividly illustrating the intricate
and complex social landscapes of Cairo in the process. Posterity will look
kindly upon the work of Moursi and Puig.” Joobin
Bekhrad, Founder and editor, Reorient.
“Manar Moursi and David Puig's Sidewalk Salon engages Cairo through the
ubiquity of its street chairs: each chair tells a unique story, together they
create a complex and quirky portrait of Cairo's public spaces.” Beth Stryker, co-founder CLUSTER (Cairo Lab
for Urban Studies, Training, and Environmental Research)
“Sidewalk
Salon is an outstanding documentation of everyday ingenuity
and creative adhocism, as
displayed through a series of chairs, half ready-made and half invented to fit
local and temporal needs of Cairo's citizens. The book showcases not only the
remarkable traits of local craftsmanship, but also the material marks of a
culture in revolt as manifest in urban space.” Lydia Kallipoliti, Assistant professor of architecture at Syracuse
University and principal of EcoRedux Research Network and ANAcycle studio. 
""An
interesting and unique project I was lucky enough to take part in. This book
documents a side of Cairo life that visitors and residents see every day but
almost never take note of."" Adam Talib,
Assistant professor at the American University of Cairo and literary translator. PERKS We've created a reference diagram below with

<p>Hippie Toilet was an interactive art installation for the Burning Man
 Regional event known as SOAK.  The installation was completed and 
available for participation at the festival between July 10th – 24th, 
2014.</p>
<p>At the festival man people came up to me and told me how they loved the project and asked if I was going to be taking it to Burning Man this year.  The short answer, is:  MAYBE...</p>
<p>The project consisted of a large (14′) trampoline frame covered in 
white stretch fabric that sloped down to a 6″ hole in the middle. Balls 
are provided on the outside that can be rolled by participants on the 
surface of the fabric “cone”. As the balls roll they interact with each 
other and bend the surface of the fabric causing other interactions. The
 entire piece is lit with colorful lighting and black lights which make 
the balls glow and cause ‘tracer’ effects as they move. Once the balls 
fall into the middle hole they are returned to the outside of the piece 
to be used again.</p>
<p>The project actually ended up being much more expensive to build than originally anticipated and I just don't have the funds to get to Burning Man with it.  However, since there was so many people that encouraged me to find a way to bring it to Burning Man this year, I've decided to launch a crowd sourced funding to try and do just that!  YOUR CONTRIBUTION WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO BRING THIS ART TO THE PLAYA!</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> </div><h3>What We Need</h3><div> </div><p>To bring the Hippie Toilet to the Playa that the project must raise at least $780 to be able to make it to the Playa and the Black Rock Arts Festival.  This covers transportation, fuel, and other basic costs.  After those costs additional funding would be used to improve several parts of the project.  </p><p>Things I'd like to do to improve the installation for Burning Man:</p><ul>
<li>Improve the ball return to be more reliable and sturdy - $100</li>
<li>Build a box to hide the generator, battery, and controller for the project. - $100</li>
<li>Add more powerful UV lights - $500</li> <li>Build a sensor that detects when balls drop through the opening and have this trigger changes in the lighting. - $200</li>
<li>Setup a simple time lapse camera to document people interacting with the piece through the festival. - $100</li> </ul><div>

<li>Help to improve the installation to make it even more impressive and interactive!</li> </ul><div>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>There are several risks to this project but they are pretty minimal since the majority of the risk and challenges have already been worked out.  As a veteran Burner, the risk of my not making it or having problems on Playa is minimal.  However, there could be transpiration issues, unexpected repairs, or the worse case scenario the stretch fabric piece is torn or damaged.  Another risk could be a failure of the lighting system on playa.  I'm going to try and minimize that possibility by all the electronics and the lights being sealed in clear plastic bags, and by shading the controller and power system during the day.</p>
<p>But the biggest risk is that I cannot find a ticket or that we do not even raise the $780 I need as a minimum to bring this project to the Playa.  However, since I am well connected in the local community I am not worried about finding a ticket for sale, and more worried about raising enough money to cover costs.<br/></p>

</div></div>","Billions of Candlepower on the Playa
Join in the sheer enjoyment of human interaction with amazing beams of pure light.Project Flashlight is billion-candlepower (really!) beams that you control with an amplified light saber or a tablet.  These things are the brightest searchlights ever made, visible from space.  On playa for art and fun.
In 2013 we had 2 searchlights at 11:00 in deep playa with tablet controls.  Maybe you saw us?
For 2014 we'll bring 4 searchlights placed in 2 locations, closer in, beaming across the city and the man.  With more interaction: we’re adding light sabers and a celestial pointing app to beam at interesting objects and aliens.
And big rainbow mirrors too.  (No unicorns, sorry.)
What We Need
We made a huge investment in 2013, and did our debut on the playa.It’s all built, it works and ready-to-go.We’re asking for your contribution to bring it back to the playa in 2014 (we're chipping in personally too).
Your contribution will help with:

Transport to the playa (freight flatbed $2000 each way - only 2 BM allowed vendors)

Load/offload logistics (Hyster rental $580)

Generator fuel on playa (4 hrs per night for 7 nights $1108)

Generator air filters (playa dust! $88)
Searchlight air filters (more playa dust, 2 for each $96)

Bits for a few more very cool features ($140)


And we’re always looking for people to join the project:

Electrical and software maker type people


Mechanics and diesel whisperers

Art and performance ideas: what do you want to do with billions of candlepower?

What Just Happened?Historic military searchlights previously used by NASA to light Apollo and Space Shuttle night launches, now on the playa for art!
It starts from the playa.  A few years back on the playa I (Neal) saw the DeathRay, a fire crew beacon using a 2.2kW army tank searchlight.  I had to have one.  Then made the mistake of asking the seller “what else do you have”...


So I ended up with a collection of military surplus AN/TVS-3 ""battlefield illuminators” from the 1960s, and started on the idea of a San Francisco Bay Area performance art installation with searchlights.  Timothy Childs joined the project, amplified the idea and provided warehouse space on Treasure Island.I got sucked in: restoring 45 year old military hardware (sitting in a field for 25 years), working with high voltage/high current Xenon short-arc bulbs, formulating dielectric coolant, procuring searchlights and 400Hz diesel generators in military surplus auctions.Jeremy Crandell joined in and made all kinds of things happen.We ended up with 18 searchlights, 6 diesel generators from 15kW to 96kW, and tons of spare parts.  This is nuts.

Now that the lights worked they had to do something.  So we formed a team including Jon Foote and Rob Gaunt to motorize these old beasts and make them interactive.  We added servo controls and software, built custom trailers.  Monica Wu made our swag.
When we brought it to the playa, Colin Bowring found us and brought his rainbows (photo from GhostShip Halloween).

</div></div>","Our atelier is a place for artistic collaboration and creation, a place to share ideas. We wish to show that art and beauty can invade every moment of our daily life and finally change the world. Original creations, exhibitions, performances, workshops are serving our goal in order to make the community grow.We believe that creativity can  be activated at any moment in life. Bleu Avant-Garde is not only an atelier, we are trying to create a new artistic mouvement that include everyone - official artists or not. We consider life as a canvas where we are all free to express ourselves regarding our own sensibilities. Quality is seen with subjectivity. It is achieve when someone is acting as free as possible. Free from social boundaries but more than everything free from any personal blocks.We want to offer a place for artists and lovers of creation, as well as promote lifestyles and choices according to our philosophy (such as using eco friendly supplies). The concept is simple : a  room with a warm atmosphere, where everybody feels good and can express himself through creative moments..Every day, during opening hours, people can share a table and work on their own draft. More than a co-working space, our aim is to give the possibility to share and exchange our experiences and fulfill our arty minds, maybe find other artists to collaborate on creative projects. That is why we offer our space to artists and curators who want to propose shows that fit our philosophy: we wish to generate collaborations that involve other enterprises, artists or individuals.From those collaborations will come out events, product designs and art exhibitions that would give the possibility to experience art during special moments. We will also act as a collective aiming to give all projects a bigger voice.During holidays and weekends, the artist Fannie Faivre will also lead some workshops for adults or children, or both, on different themes according to the sensibility of the moment. It would be a way to enhance everyone inner power of creation.




Bleu Avant-Garde this is Fannie Faivre.
Fannie Faivre is animating the workshops at Bleu Avant-Garde Atelier. She graduated from Fine Arts in Paris. Her aim is to keep a poetic vision in everything she does. She began as a painter and illustrator,  and is now using her artistic skills to share a different vision of Art with people. Surrounded by her family and friends, she has opened the Bleu Avant Garde Atelier in Berlin as an open window to free creativity.



""I am interested in the process of creation. Whatever the result you have, it's the emotions you put inside and the way you do it that is important for me. Art is not only in museums, but mainly in you, in everything you do"".
Visit her website : http://fanniefaivre.weebly.com/


Bleu Avant-Garde this is also Marion Rogers. 
Marion has discover the arts quite late in her life and she was delighted every second since. Her goal is to promote art and culture by engaging fruitful collaborations between artists and to bring more people to feel art in themselves. She is acting as an agent for emerging artists in order to help them to find their own voice and to promote themselves more clearly. She would like more people to live surrounded with art. She is acting to develop the art market for everyone, artists and collectors.
She is involved in the counseling agency La Conciergerie.

In order to give our reality life, we will need your support. There is nothing we could do on our own and because we absolutely need you to adhere to our project, we decided to start a crowdfunding campaign.
The money we raise will allow us to order supplies from ecological enterprises (paints, papers, canvas and others materials), to prepare our atelier in a way that will allow creativity to flow, assuring secure experience to children, clear mind to parents and a good space for creation. 
It will also allow us to pay the artists involved in the collaboration for the work done.
