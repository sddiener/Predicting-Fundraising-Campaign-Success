<h2>The Adventure</h2>
<p>Beginning August 1st, I’m beginning on a quest to cultivate a robust, diverse, and well-travled <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/19/magazine/say-hello-to-the-100-trillion-bacteria-that-make-up-your-microbiome.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">microbiome</a>. In other words, I am going to ferment myself.</p>
<p>This means that</p>
<ol>
<li>Eat live fermented food everyday.  Preferably a bit at each meal.</li>
<li>Learn as much as I can about what contributes to a healthy microbiome and do those things: ie. Dig in the dirt, eat prebiotics (fibrous raw vegetables), and play with lots of animals.</li>
<li>Visit every continent in order to ingest the microorganisms, connect with the people, and learn about the world’s fermentation traditions.</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>The Rationale</strong></h2>
<p>The reasons that I am doing this are:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">1. Well first, I admit. I love fermentation. I first was introduced to the idea at workshop that <a href=""http://www.wildfermentation.com/who-is-sandorkraut/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sandor Katz</a> did at <a href=""http://www.bastyr.edu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bastyr University</a>, and I was totally enchanted by the idea that by chopping up some vegetables and adding salt, that you can create a whole living ecosystem. I just find this incredible. Since then, I’ve turned many a jar into a bubbling community of microbes. </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">2. I’m 27 and have grand ambitions to settle down and have a family and a farm and babies running everywhere so when that happens, I’m certainly not going to be traveling aound the world fermenting myself so I might as well do it now.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">3. And lastly, I’m truly curious about what will happen. How will the microbes change me? Is it true how they say that the microcosm is a reflection of the macrocosm? By changing my insides, will I really change the world. What will happen physically, what will happen mentally, psychologically, spiritually? </p>
<h2>The Plan (In Slightly More Detail)</h2>

</div></div>","The Adventure
Beginning August 1st, I’m beginning on a quest to cultivate a robust, diverse, and well-travled microbiome. In other words, I am going to ferment myself.
This means that

Eat live fermented food everyday.  Preferably a bit at each meal.
Learn as much as I can about what contributes to a healthy microbiome and do those things: ie. Dig in the dirt, eat prebiotics (fibrous raw vegetables), and play with lots of animals.
Visit every continent in order to ingest the microorganisms, connect with the people, and learn about the world’s fermentation traditions.

The Rationale
The reasons that I am doing this are:
1. Well first, I admit. I love fermentation. I first was introduced to the idea at workshop that Sandor Katz did at Bastyr University, and I was totally enchanted by the idea that by chopping up some vegetables and adding salt, that you can create a whole living ecosystem. I just find this incredible. Since then, I’ve turned many a jar into a bubbling community of microbes. 
2. I’m 27 and have grand ambitions to settle down and have a family and a farm and babies running everywhere so when that happens, I’m certainly not going to be traveling aound the world fermenting myself so I might as well do it now.
3. And lastly, I’m truly curious about what will happen. How will the microbes change me? Is it true how they say that the microcosm is a reflection of the macrocosm? By changing my insides, will I really change the world. What will happen physically, what will happen mentally, psychologically, spiritually? 
The Plan (In Slightly More Detail)
For the month of August, I will establish a base line by living in the town where I grew up, working on an organic farm, walking a silly labrador named Gertrude, and eating lots of fermented food. I also will do a microbiome analysis through American Gut, a project that is working to map the human microbiome. 
Then, in September, I will take off. Due to previous gypsy tendencies, I have quite a few contacts around the world and am working on setting up an itinerary that begins in Brussels and then takes me to Austria, Portugal, Kenya, Tanzania, Thailand, Japan, the Northwest Territories of Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, Argentina, Costa Rica, Mexico, and then back to the U.S. I will stay with families and document home fermentation traditions.
I will travel until Christmas 2013 and then return to Michigan, do another microbiome analysis, and let all the fermenting action age for a few months while I write a book. 
My travels and the food traditions that I encounter will be documented on my blog, The Hearth Project, as well as in the book.
 
How You Can Help
I’m looking to raise $20,000 to cover the costs of travel, recording equipment, and to begin the book.  
If you're unable to contribute financially, there are other ways that you can help. 
1. Tell your friends about this adventure. Post, twitter, write, phone, whatever it takes. Please help me get the word out.
2. I'm still looking for contacts especially in Africa and Asia. If you or anyone you know is a fermentation enthusiast in those regions, please e-mail me at rebeccasornson@gmail.com
3. I am open to traveling companions! If you want to accompany me on a leg of this journey, send me an e-mail and let's talk! rebeccasornson@gmail.com
If I don't succeed in reaching my goal, I will still go forward with the project. I may have to adapt my itinerary slightly, but I am committed to self fermentation!
So, in conclusion, if you’d like to support this dream in any way please do.
My biggest hope is that this adventure is inspiring...to you and to the world. Thanks so much for your help!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong><em>Breast Cancer Fundraiser Benefit for </em></strong><strong><em>Dianne LeVasseur</em></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>My mother has always been the Heartbeat of our family.  My parents worked hard full time all of their lives to raise my two brothers and I.  During those years, my mother is the one who ran the entire house, getting us all to our activities, doctors and making sure dinner was on the table. After spending all of her life caring for others and making sure all their needs were met, she now, is the one in need.  She was diagnosed with Breast Cancer 10 years ago and has undergone a battery of tests and procedures.  Recently, her cancer metastisized to her lung, tailbone and liver and she was upgraded to Stage 4.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, ""when it rains, it pours.""  Two years ago, in the midst of my mother's battle, my father suffered a fall that left him with a broken rib and a punctured lung.  While being treated, it was discovered that he had prostate cancer as well as an aneurism.  He underwent surgery, but his place of employment of 38 years was unable to hold his position as he endured a long recovery from his fall and subsequent cancer and brain surgeries.  </p>
<p>Now, between the loss of employment and my mother's illness progression, my parents are suffering from the financial strain.  They have always been such hard workers and have never asked or been given any kind of assistance.  In a difficult heart to heart recently, my mother told me that instead of having a funeral she would rather see old friends and family in person.  So, my family is planning a benefit for my mother to not only help raise funds for her treatments, but as a reunion as well.  We are trying to rally as many raffles as possible to help raise money and we are asking a $10.00 ticket price. We are hoping that between any donated raffles as well as the ticket price, some of the financial strain may be lifted so that my mother can focus on her care and enjoying her family and grandchildren as long as possible.</p>
<p>Please consider donating to these wonderful, hardworking people that have stumbled on a hard time at the twilight of their lives.  When they should be relaxing and enjoying their grandchildren, they are worrying about things like, how will they pay the heat bill as well as the cancer medication.  Thank you so much for your consideration of helping my mother. If you knew her, I am certain you would understand what a wonderful loving woman she is and know that your funds are going to a wonderful cause to sustain the life of a beloved Grandmother, mother and wife. </p>

<p><strong>Maria Isabel needs to go back to Michigan for surgery!!</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, her retinas are detaching again after the second set of surgeries she had last year. Apparently a problem with the eye mechanism is causing this problem, and if is not fixed on a timely manner, she could become completely blind! She's only 1 1/2 years, and have suffered 12 surgeries; 11 of them before reaching her 1rst year!!</p>
<p>With your help you can send her, her mom and grandma back to Michigan to have this -hopefully- last surgery so she can see our smiling faces!!</p>
<p>No retinal surgeons in Puerto Rico wants to perform a surgery on her or at least attempt any kind of treatment.</p>
<p>Please, help us with whatever you can!! $1.00 is good if the thousands of friends we all have can give one... If we reach our goal, we can help another baby that has to go back for the same surgery!<br/><br/>Thanks!!!</p>

Norma was diagnosed on April 5, 2012 with stage 4 Lung Cancer that was suspected to have mestatisized. At that time she was assigned an Oncologist by the hospital who we thought was a very nice person. At the time I took her for an office visit with this oncologist she basically told us to prepare for the worst and then proceeded to tell us that we would need cash payments everytime we came to her office.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Well I was particularly frustrated with the small room with no tv and no interaction where Norma was suppose to recieve pallative care. Norma was beat down from the news so I got busy on the internet. I researched ""The Cancer Center of America"" beacuse the commercials were abundant and I was ready to make the voyage to Philly! BUT they didn't take her insurance.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>After many let downs I looked in our own back yard...Johns Hopkins Sydney Kimmel Cancer Center! I immediately called and got her registered and didn't even tell her until I confirmed her intake appointment. From day one of going to JH her treatment was prioritized, test were immediate and her cancer was downgraded to Stage 3b, no spread.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>She embarked on an 8week treatment cycle in a place filled with life and smiles and doctors we could call at anytime. Needless to say this helped in a BIG way to have this support. Now that her treatment is over we've been told the tumor is shrinking and her breathing has improved as well as her outlook on life. She lives for the day and we want to make her days stress free and beautiful which is why we are here...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><br/>In light of the news we've tapped our our bank accounts and are not looking to be reimbursed but we need to prepare for future cost that we don't have the finances for because we threw the kitchen sink at getting the treatment done daily for 8 weeks. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The needs are $8300:</p>
<ul>
<li>$3500 toward copays</li>
<li>$1800 in her household expenses that are behind</li>
<li>$3000 toward funeral pre-arrangement cost (this is a sad reality for us but we stretch the days)</li>
</ul>
<p>And money towards $1700:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cases of Ensure</li>
<li>Fruits and Produce from the Farmers Market</li>
<li>Food (Currently ""SNAP"" only provides her with $79/month)</li>
<li>Gas for future appointments</li>
<li>Parking vouchers for the JHU Cancer Center</li>
<li>A new bed &amp; Pillows for comfort</li>
</ul>
<p>We will donate 5% to the American Cancer Society. And if we raise ""Above &amp; Beyond"" the amount it will be used to move Norma Jean to a new apartment complex closer to her family so she can also keep her dog ""Bruno"" (a Chi-Poo) because her leasing office says they've changed rules and don't allow dogs which is another stresser for her.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
The impact is BIGGER than you could imagine, this will help releive a ton of stress and let the healing continue! I have not told her about this but have linked this campaign to her bank account and will record a video of us telling her the results of what has been done with this campaign.

<ul>
<li>Abby doesn't have any siblings to run around with and is an only child. She has also been consistently behind her peers in development and even though she is a fun loving, happy toddler, she tends to be very timid about trying new activities. A therapy dog would have a huge impact on her daily life! Part of the duties the dog would perform includes motivating her to practice walking (at two she is not yet walking but very close) and would require regular exercise. Exercise for Abby is also very important because she has been hovering around the 100th percentile for weight since birth and has low muscle tone and a slower metabolism due to her Down syndrome.<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/529584_10200156444567304_1164257433_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
</li>
<li>The dog will also help her navigate her world, will be attuned to her emotional state and will help her calm down if over stimulated or frustrated. The dog can help with stranger intervention to keep her safe and also be there with her during transitions throughout her day.</li>
<li>Abby already exhibits a great love for animals and is very gentle when petting them. Having a dog not only trained to meet her needs but also is a dependable, loyal companion will have a profound impact on Abby’s life. I firmly believe that a therapy will not only instill greater self-confidence but also be the motivation she needs to continue to meet her goals and objectives.</li>

<ul>
<li>The cost of a trained therapy dog is broken down as follows:</li>
<li>$35 enrollment</li>
<li>$350 startup fee</li>
<li>$800 Dog Fee</li>
<li>$70 a month for the training of the dog with a 12 month minimum.</li>
<li>If our goal isn’t reached on indigogo in the specified time, we are going to continue to fundraise locally until our goal is met.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We are excited to offer a personalized photo of Abby with her therapy dog for $25 contributions. Training starts in June so I promise pictures will be in      the mail shortly thereafter. For larger contributions, we are going to have commemorative ornaments made of Abby and her dog.</li>

<li>Therapy dogs are placed with adults and children who have a physical, cognitive, or emotional need that can be helped with a loving pet or companion. These needs might include depression, loneliness or anxiety.

<p> </p></div>","Making a Difference
My daughter Abby is two years old and has Down syndrome.

Abby doesn't have any siblings to run around with and is an only child. She has also been consistently behind her peers in development and even though she is a fun loving, happy toddler, she tends to be very timid about trying new activities. A therapy dog would have a huge impact on her daily life! Part of the duties the dog would perform includes motivating her to practice walking (at two she is not yet walking but very close) and would require regular exercise. Exercise for Abby is also very important because she has been hovering around the 100th percentile for weight since birth and has low muscle tone and a slower metabolism due to her Down syndrome.

The dog will also help her navigate her world, will be attuned to her emotional state and will help her calm down if over stimulated or frustrated. The dog can help with stranger intervention to keep her safe and also be there with her during transitions throughout her day.
Abby already exhibits a great love for animals and is very gentle when petting them. Having a dog not only trained to meet her needs but also is a dependable, loyal companion will have a profound impact on Abby’s life. I firmly believe that a therapy will not only instill greater self-confidence but also be the motivation she needs to continue to meet her goals and objectives.

What We Need & What You Get

The cost of a trained therapy dog is broken down as follows:
$35 enrollment
$350 startup fee
$800 Dog Fee
$70 a month for the training of the dog with a 12 month minimum.
If our goal isn’t reached on indigogo in the specified time, we are going to continue to fundraise locally until our goal is met.


We are excited to offer a personalized photo of Abby with her therapy dog for $25 contributions. Training starts in June so I promise pictures will be in      the mail shortly thereafter. For larger contributions, we are going to have commemorative ornaments made of Abby and her dog.

Organizations Making An Impact

Therapy dogs are placed with adults and children who have a physical, cognitive, or emotional need that can be helped with a loving pet or companion. These needs might include depression, loneliness or anxiety. Emotional Support Animals often provide a reason to get up in the morning, motivation to exercise, and they give there human partners someone to care for.


We are working with a non-profit organization called Sunstone Service Dogs and their website is: http://www.oregonassistancedogs.org/index

A multi-sensor inside Insulog detects and counts insulin units injected. A smart software algorithm transforms the information, records and logs it on Insulog.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: </strong>What does the display screen on Insulog show?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> The screen shows your last intake, both the time lapsed from the last injections and it’s amount.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: </strong>Can I track my glucose levels with Insulog?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Insulog doesn’t measure or track glucose levels, however, you will be able to transfer data from you BGM to the Insulog app via the OTG BGM-App sync cable so you can keep and share all the important information in one place.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Why is Insulog better than writing down all the information?</p><p><strong>A: </strong>Writing down your insulin intakes always has the risk of forgetting sometimes. Insulog automatically logs all your information, you don’t need to remember, Insulog remembers for you.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: </strong>Will Insulog be approved by FDA?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Will the cost of Insulog be covered by my medical insurance?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> That issue will need to be clarified with your medical insurance. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can Insulog measure half units?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> For the moment, no.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Will Insulog be produced even if it doesn't reach the campaign goal?</p><p><strong>A: </strong>Insulog is close to our hearts and we believe will have a significant change on the lives of diabetics. For that reason, we are determined on producing Insulog. If the campaign does not reach its goal we will turn to other financial solutions and investments. </p></div>","In short, it's a small device that adds a layer of health security by eliminating insulin uncertainty.Insulog™ snaps onto insulin pens to track insulin usage automatically.

Even so, an accidental double dose intake made him search for a better solution for insulin tracking, which ultimately lead him to  create Insulog.Alex has years of experience in R&D with diverse fields (Medical, Robotics, Industrial, Security, Wireless & Control and Testing Systems) and led the R&D Insulog team .  Alex is also Founder & CEO of NEAT Applied Technologies. Michael was manager of design for over 15 years at AVR, working with modern medical technologies. For the last 10 years, Michael has been a Project Manager at NEAT.  For the last few months he has been the lead designer at Insulog. Ela is the industrial designer of Insulog. She has many years of experience in designing medical high-tech devices and adapting them to comfortable, convenient and easy consumer use.  Amir has years of experience in R&D. He led the development team for Insulog's App and developed the mathematical algorithm that ensures Insulog measures accurately all insulin injections.        FAQQ: What insuilin pens does Insulog work with?A: Insulog is compatible with all major insulin pens. Insulog Classic fits the Flexpen (by Novonordisk), Kwikpen (by Eli Lilly) and Solostar (by Sanofi), and we’ve also created a wider version to fit the new FlexTouch pen by Novonordisk. You can chose the type of insulog you need during purchase. Q: How long does Insulog’s charge keep?A: Insulog’s charge keeps on average for several days. Q: Can I buy two Insulogs, one for my short term insulin pen and one for my long term one? How will the information sync between them?A: Yes, one of the perks is two Insulog’s for exactly that reason. Each Insulog will display the last intake done with the pen it’s on and on the App the information from each will be displayed separately. Q: How long will Insulog last for?A: Insulog lasts for years. It comes with a Micro USB charging cable, and it's charge last for days. Insulog is made from durable materials so you can be asure you can use it for a very long time.  Q: Does the Insulog app require a setup?A: Yes, the first time you use Insulog and the app you will choose the relevant insulin injected. Q: How do I know whether Insulog is good for me?A: If you use disposable insulin pens then Insulog is good for you. Insulog snaps on easily to insulin pens, logs automatically the time and dose of each of your intakes, displays the last intake on it’s screen, and syncs all the information to your Insulog app. Q: Does the Insulog app work with both Android and iOS?A: yes. Q: Can the Insulog sync with multiple Insulog devices (for example, one for the short term pen and one for the long term one)?A: Yes, the  app can work with two devices at the same time. The user will be able to pair different Insulog devices with different names for each insulin type so that all relevant information is synced.  Q: Is Insulog easy to use?A: Very, just snap it onto your insulin pen and never wonder when you last injected, or how much was your last dose, a quick glance at Insulog and you have all the information. Q: What does the Insulog Kit include?A: Insulog Kit includes Insulog itself, a Micro USB charging cable, a BGM-Phone sync cable (OTG) and a user guide. In addition you’ll get to choose the color of your Insulog. Q: Does Insulog come in a variety of colors?A: Yes, when you purchase you’ll be able to choose between white, chrome and blue. Q: Will Insulog help me improve my A1C?A: Absolutely, since Insulog helps you stay aware of all your intake history, it’s time and dosage, it helps understand your mistakes and helps you maintain a stable life and lower your A1C results. Q: What other Apps does Insulog work with?A: Insulog easily integrates with Apple and Google healthkits. Q: Is Insulog accurate?A: Yes, thanks to our technology, Insulog is very accurate in measuring the time and dose so that it’s safe and easy to use for every diabetic. Q: How do I share information with my health care team?A: Information is easily shared through the app. Q: How does Insulog sync to the app on my phone?A: Insulog automatically syncs all information via BLE. Q: How does Insulog work?A: Insulog is designed to fit all disposable insulin pens. A multi-sensor inside Insulog detects and counts insulin units injected. A smart software algorithm transforms the information, records and logs it on Insulog. Q: What does the display screen on Insulog show?A: The screen shows your last intake, both the time lapsed from the last injections and it’s amount. Q: Can I track my glucose levels with Insulog?A: Insulog doesn’t measure or track glucose levels, however, you will be able to transfer data from you BGM to the Insulog app via the OTG BGM-App sync cable so you can keep and share all the important information in one place. Q: Why is Insulog better than writing down all the information?A: Writing down your insulin intakes always has the risk of forgetting sometimes. Insulog automatically logs all your information, you don’t need to remember, Insulog remembers for you. Q: Will Insulog be approved by FDA?A: Yes. Q: Will the cost of Insulog be covered by my medical insurance?A: That issue will need to be clarified with your medical insurance.  Q: Can Insulog measure half units?A: For the moment, no. Q: Will Insulog be produced even if it doesn't reach the campaign goal?A: Insulog is close to our hearts and we believe will have a significant change on the lives of diabetics. For that reason, we are determined on producing Insulog. If the campaign does not reach its goal we will turn to other financial solutions and investments.",52.0,0,"1 Campaign

Our goal is to provide state-of-the-art treatment to children who otherwise may not receive modern treatments for their complex spinal problems. In order to provide sustainable local care to these children, we are equally dedicated to teaching local physicians and staff to provide these treatments themselves.

</p><p>SpineHope has traditionally been recognized as
a nonprofit that does work internationally, coordinating medical missions that
handle complex spine deformity cases for children. But just this year SpineHope
successfully launched a program (our Hub Program) in which we bring select
children to Austin, TX for their spine surgical treatment. These patients come
from countries where there is currently no access to adequate treatment and
where there currently isn't an outreach program or medical mission that can
treat them locally. </p>
<p>On average, we get 1-2 cases a  month emailed to us from

ethically addressing these referrals and requests for help. </p>

I want to travel to Las Vegas Nevada to present a paper at the Sexual Health &amp; Politics Conference hosted by the Desiree Alliance, July 14-19th 2013, and I've set up this appeal to raise the funds that will help me get there. </p>
<p>The conference brings together people who are passionate about, and who are working towards better conditions and social status for people involved in sex work, however that may be defined, all over the world. </p>

The point is that I firmly believe that sex workers and those working in the field of sexuality in general must be able to set our own agendas in order to work in safe and healthy ways, and that moral values have no place in deciding whether or not a person is entitled to the full protection of both the law (including employment laws) and the judicial system. </p>
<p>Many sex workers feel isolated, vulnerable and fearful in their daily work.

Our Story .....<font size=""4""><strong><u>{W</u></strong></font><font color=""#000000""><strong><u><font size=""4"">arning may get a bit graphic}</font></u><font size=""3""></font></strong> <p></p></font> 

My husband Douglas Todd English and I met May 28, 2004, we started dating July 4, 2004 and we were married October 22, 2005 Life was great and just seemed like it couldn't get any better.. Then April 20, 2006 (my dadâ€™s birthday) and just 6 short months after getting married He was in a major accident! Todd was a delivery driver for a HVAC supply company and was making deliveries that day. I was on my way to Birmingham to take my youngest child to a heart checkup 2 and 1/2 hours away in Birmingham (she is not Todd's child) but back to the story... It seemed like everything that could make me get behind that morning happened. I just couldn't seem to get out of town that morning and I was on the Nextel chatting back and forth with Todd that morning letting him know that we were getting ready to go and would be heading out of town shortly.. then my oldest daughter spilled something on her shirt ( another delay ) so I had to run in the thrift store and grab her a decent shirt to change into because we were already 30 minutes away from home. As I was in the store I left my phone in the truck and Todd chirped up on the Nextel and told my oldest to have me key up on him as soon as I got out of the store.. So I did, but no answer so I thought he may be at a delivery and gave him a few minutes and tried again, but again no answer so now I was getting concerned so I kept trying to key up on the Nextel but still no response back. 

Now Todd and I are both volunteer firefighters and I just happen to have my FD pager and radio with me that day and for some reason my pager was scanning which means that if a call goes off anywhere in the county we live in that my pager would transmit it.. and then all of a sudden the pager goes off for Killen and center star volunteer fire depts. so I just hit the reset button cause it wasn't our dept. and it was a gut feeling that was like turn that back on you want to hear that so I hit the scan button again just in time to hear the dispatcher say that those depts. needed to respond to a wreck with roll over and entrapment in front of brooks high school ( which is about where Todd should have been by that time) and all the while this was going on I was still unable to contact Todd over the phone.... so after the pager went off I decided to turn the FD scanner/walkie talkie on and listen to the call and all of a sudden I heard one of the firefighters say to the other dept. "" you get that white flatbed ford right there and I will get this other truck"" ok now I am franticly trying to get ahold of Todd on the phone cause that is the type of vehicle he was in that day! I still could not reach him so I called and canceled the heart doctor apt and had it rescheduled for a later date and began to drive towards the wreck scene as I was still unable to get Todd on the phone. I began to key up on the Nextel and kept calling his name and finally I heard a chirp back but my relief was short lived as the voice on the other end was not Todd and they said whom am I speaking with? And I came back, kind of choked up and said this is Todd's wife, who is this? then the response i received back was ""Well this is so n so from Killen Police dept. and your husband has been in a bad wreck and the rescue crews are working to get him out of the vehicle at this time"" .. 

Now by this time I was nearly to the accident scene so I told the police officer that and we ended the conversation then.. A few minutes later I arrived on scene and they already had him in the back of the ambulance getting him stabilized to transport to where the helicopter was landing to take him to the trauma center an hour away. I remember getting to the back of the ambulance where the back doors were open and they were working on him and he was moaning and moving around alot and then the fire chief of center star walked up to the back of the ambulance and put his arm around me as to comfort me and told the paramedics that I was his wife and as soon as they told Todd that his wife was there he quit fighting them and allowed them to work ( now he don't remember any of this till this day ) but then we drove to the helicopter landing zone and I remember standing at the back of the ambulance praying to God to not let my husband die because the Lord had just gave him to me and we had only been married 6 short months and I begged and begged God not to let him die... Then Med flight landed and the flight medic came off the helicopter and went into the ambulance to access my husband and see if he was stable enough to fly and after what seemed like an eternity the flight medic came out and walked up to me and wrapped his arm around me and looked at me and said "" He is critical and if his lungs collapse do we have your permission to re-inflate them?"" and I said ""yes do what you have to do. So he can live!"" Then they brought him out of the ambulance and rolled him to the helicopter and left. 

Now I still had to drive an hour to get to the hospital once I finally got there, they already had him in the trauma bay in the ER and at first they said he was to unstable for me to go back to the room and I remember sitting in the er waiting room just waiting and as family began to trickle in I told them that I still didn't know anything finally they said I could go back when I got back there they gave me a plastic cup with lid that had his bloody wedding ring that was cut in half in it and I was not ready nor prepared for what I saw! He laid there still on the back board and still in the neck brace and I broke, I began to cry he looked so awful and all cut up and the swelling had already began, his left hand was cut nearly in half down the middle and he had bleeding out of both ears (and with us both being in the EMS field I knew that bleeding from the ears was a sign of a head or brain injury and usually not a good outcome), then I began to cry more ..... I wasn't sure if I was going to lose him or not at that point. After hours in the ER room the doctor finally came in to talk to me and this is all he said â€œyour husband has a skull fracture from ear to ear across the front of his head"" then he left!!! I didn't even get a chance to ask him anything! Of course my fear kicked in and I began to cry more and after 12 hours in the ER they finally moved him up to the NICU (Neurological ICU) and it was midnight by this time and they told me as soon as he was settled and stable they would come get us. We ( his dad and I) were allowed to see him for only 10 minutes that night. 
Then that morning around 8 we got to see him again he was awake but he didn't know who I was, but he knew his dad and people that he knew from years ago but didn't remember who I was, I was horrified! I began to think his short term memory was GONE! And that our wedding and our life together was gone too... It was like that for the next 3 days that he was in the NICU and each time I was allowed to see him I would tell him about the accident and where he was and what had happened but every time I would see him at the next visit he didnâ€™t even remember what I had just told him and then mid-morning on that 3rd day when I came in to see him in the NICU I took a deep breath ready to tell him the story again in hopes that he would remember something, especially me, but as I walked into the room he looked up and said â€œwell there's my honey"" OH the relief! He remembered who I was! I was so thankful and that day they moved him into a regular room and he stayed there for 5 more days for a total of 8 days. On the 7th day they did the first surgery on his left hand to repair it. He was released the next day to rehab at home it took him nearly a month to walk again and as soon as he was back on his feet we started to church. His recovery took a year and then he went back to work and worked a short time and his injuries got worse and he was out of work for another year. 

His Injuries were a closed head injury, frontal skull fracture from ear to ear and fractured sinus bone on the left side of his face that was not repairable, a concussion, High frequency hearing loss in both ears, broke bones in his left hand, that required two surgeries and a titanium plate and screws to put back together and months of therapy to get back to be able to use it and still cannot fully close his hand all the way. But He was not able to go back to work in the same field as he was in and he had to learn a whole new trade. Now his medical bills totaled over $280,000 and even though we had a great attorney the state cap on a workmanâ€™s comp accident was $5,000 but they offered him $17,000 so we took it. So we are still trying to pay on the bills and loans we had to take out in order to make it while he wasnâ€™t working and that leads us to the next part of this storyâ€¦â€¦.


Now that I have gotten you up to speed on the wreck situation I will tell you a bit about us wanting a baby or two. I had a partial hysterectomy on May 20, 2004 just 8 days before Todd and I met ... I had been married twice before my first husband died in a house fire and my second husband nearly killed me and the children (Just two weeks after my youngest that was 3 yrs. old at the time had heart surgery to put a pacemaker in) and he is currently sitting in Mississippi prison. So I had 2 children by each marriage and Todd knew this when we got married and we once we were married we began to put money away out of each paycheck to begin saving for a surrogate mother to carry our baby (embryo - my egg and his sperm ) but after the wreck the little bit of money that we had in savings had to be used to live on while he was out of work and now we have tried to get back on our feet and get the funds back up but we just can't seem to be able to. I have researched the cost and it is a min of $30,000 for a surrogate mom to carry our child plus the hospital bill for the delivery so that is why our goal is set at $51,000 I understand times are hard but if just 51,000 people would donate just $1 we could have our dream and give this selfless man a gift of his own ( a biological child ) He was so selfless coming into this marriage knowing that we would not be able to have children the normal way but now even the dream we had of having a child has been taken from us. This is why I have come here to ask of you all to help us to achieve that goal. 

You can follow our journey as it unfolds on our Facebook page so each person that donates to our cause can follow the story and know that the money you share from your heart will be used for this process only. I would love for nothing more than to give my husband the thing he desires most and that is to become a ""dad"" As my youngest was 5yrs old when Todd and I met. Thank you for your time in reading this story of our life and thank you in advance for your donation to help fund our dream of being parents. If any of you want to see pictures of the wrecked truck that he was in and the truck that hit him and pictures of him after he was out of NICU and in a regular room or follow us just follow this link to our Facebook page that was created for this journey. Here is the link .... <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100003283977159&amp;ref=tn_tnmn"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=10000328...</a> 

If for some reason we do not raise the whole amount of money it takes to pay for the surrogate and the delivery of our baby, our next choice will be to take the funds raised to adopt a newborn baby. I believe our goal will be met because Todd is a selfless man and He loves unconditionally and I know our Lord will reward that and we will met or exceed our goal and be blessed with our miracle. I thank all of you for being a part in that, and helping make our dream come true. May the Lore richly bless each of you that donate and those of you who pray for our family as well.</div>","This is a long post but here is ..... Our Story .....{Warning may get a bit graphic}  

My husband Douglas Todd English and I met May 28, 2004, we started dating July 4, 2004 and we were married October 22, 2005 Life was great and just seemed like it couldn't get any better.. Then April 20, 2006 (my dadâ€™s birthday) and just 6 short months after getting married He was in a major accident! Todd was a delivery driver for a HVAC supply company and was making deliveries that day. I was on my way to Birmingham to take my youngest child to a heart checkup 2 and 1/2 hours away in Birmingham (she is not Todd's child) but back to the story... It seemed like everything that could make me get behind that morning happened. I just couldn't seem to get out of town that morning and I was on the Nextel chatting back and forth with Todd that morning letting him know that we were getting ready to go and would be heading out of town shortly.. then my oldest daughter spilled something on her shirt ( another delay ) so I had to run in the thrift store and grab her a decent shirt to change into because we were already 30 minutes away from home. As I was in the store I left my phone in the truck and Todd chirped up on the Nextel and told my oldest to have me key up on him as soon as I got out of the store.. So I did, but no answer so I thought he may be at a delivery and gave him a few minutes and tried again, but again no answer so now I was getting concerned so I kept trying to key up on the Nextel but still no response back. 

Now Todd and I are both volunteer firefighters and I just happen to have my FD pager and radio with me that day and for some reason my pager was scanning which means that if a call goes off anywhere in the county we live in that my pager would transmit it.. and then all of a sudden the pager goes off for Killen and center star volunteer fire depts. so I just hit the reset button cause it wasn't our dept. and it was a gut feeling that was like turn that back on you want to hear that so I hit the scan button again just in time to hear the dispatcher say that those depts. needed to respond to a wreck with roll over and entrapment in front of brooks high school ( which is about where Todd should have been by that time) and all the while this was going on I was still unable to contact Todd over the phone.... so after the pager went off I decided to turn the FD scanner/walkie talkie on and listen to the call and all of a sudden I heard one of the firefighters say to the other dept. "" you get that white flatbed ford right there and I will get this other truck"" ok now I am franticly trying to get ahold of Todd on the phone cause that is the type of vehicle he was in that day! I still could not reach him so I called and canceled the heart doctor apt and had it rescheduled for a later date and began to drive towards the wreck scene as I was still unable to get Todd on the phone. I began to key up on the Nextel and kept calling his name and finally I heard a chirp back but my relief was short lived as the voice on the other end was not Todd and they said whom am I speaking with? And I came back, kind of choked up and said this is Todd's wife, who is this? then the response i received back was ""Well this is so n so from Killen Police dept. and your husband has been in a bad wreck and the rescue crews are working to get him out of the vehicle at this time"" .. 

Now by this time I was nearly to the accident scene so I told the police officer that and we ended the conversation then.. A few minutes later I arrived on scene and they already had him in the back of the ambulance getting him stabilized to transport to where the helicopter was landing to take him to the trauma center an hour away. I remember getting to the back of the ambulance where the back doors were open and they were working on him and he was moaning and moving around alot and then the fire chief of center star walked up to the back of the ambulance and put his arm around me as to comfort me and told the paramedics that I was his wife and as soon as they told Todd that his wife was there he quit fighting them and allowed them to work ( now he don't remember any of this till this day ) but then we drove to the helicopter landing zone and I remember standing at the back of the ambulance praying to God to not let my husband die because the Lord had just gave him to me and we had only been married 6 short months and I begged and begged God not to let him die... Then Med flight landed and the flight medic came off the helicopter and went into the ambulance to access my husband and see if he was stable enough to fly and after what seemed like an eternity the flight medic came out and walked up to me and wrapped his arm around me and looked at me and said "" He is critical and if his lungs collapse do we have your permission to re-inflate them?"" and I said ""yes do what you have to do. So he can live!"" Then they brought him out of the ambulance and rolled him to the helicopter and left. 

Now I still had to drive an hour to get to the hospital once I finally got there, they already had him in the trauma bay in the ER and at first they said he was to unstable for me to go back to the room and I remember sitting in the er waiting room just waiting and as family began to trickle in I told them that I still didn't know anything finally they said I could go back when I got back there they gave me a plastic cup with lid that had his bloody wedding ring that was cut in half in it and I was not ready nor prepared for what I saw! He laid there still on the back board and still in the neck brace and I broke, I began to cry he looked so awful and all cut up and the swelling had already began, his left hand was cut nearly in half down the middle and he had bleeding out of both ears (and with us both being in the EMS field I knew that bleeding from the ears was a sign of a head or brain injury and usually not a good outcome), then I began to cry more ..... I wasn't sure if I was going to lose him or not at that point. After hours in the ER room the doctor finally came in to talk to me and this is all he said â€œyour husband has a skull fracture from ear to ear across the front of his head"" then he left!!! I didn't even get a chance to ask him anything! Of course my fear kicked in and I began to cry more and after 12 hours in the ER they finally moved him up to the NICU (Neurological ICU) and it was midnight by this time and they told me as soon as he was settled and stable they would come get us. We ( his dad and I) were allowed to see him for only 10 minutes that night. 
Then that morning around 8 we got to see him again he was awake but he didn't know who I was, but he knew his dad and people that he knew from years ago but didn't remember who I was, I was horrified! I began to think his short term memory was GONE! And that our wedding and our life together was gone too...

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi. i'm Dave. I love the game of golf. My friends and I have created a unique way of helping golfers improve their game with automated stat tracking tools. There's several golf apps out there today, but the brutal pain of tracking your golf shots is having to input 5 or 6 options everytime you hit the ball. We've solved this...</p>
<p><span>Introducing automatic stat tracking. We've created technology that enables us to map golf courses anywhere in the world, defining detailed GPS information about every fairway, green and hazard. Users play golf with our app and with the press of a button or a shake of their device, we auto-detect the shot's position, distance, lie, club used, and more. We take all the work out of stat tracking so the golfer can focus on their game.</span></p>

</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our technology only works because we have maticulously mapped every hole on each golf course. So far, we've hit about 8,000 courses, which is just over half of the United States. We'd love to complete every course on the globe, but we need your help. </p>
<ul>
<li>We need about $25,000 to complete the rest of the golf courses in the U.S. At that point, we can easily move to other countries with golf enthusiasts and give those people the same great service we're currently providing for people in thre U.S.</li>
<li>We've come up with a really valuable service to provide to golfers. We just need a little assistance to be able to complete our data collection. We're not a big company, but we know we have a big idea, and we just want it out there for people to use.</li>
<li>We're currently offering all of our services for free. This is a service for the golfer, by the golfer. We want to do something great for golf.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course there are operating costs with growing a business. As we grow, we'll be offering even more services to make the game of golf more fun. Once we have a stable system in place, we'll be offering a few premium products and services... you guessed it, those of you who help us out now will be rewarded with many perks and 100% cost-free services as we build them out.</p>
<p>Our goal of $25,000 should help us map every course in the Unted States, but even if we don't reach our goal, anything we raise will go towards this strategy. And if we raise more, we'll hit some more countries!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We're changing the way golfers can track their game. The services that exist today are either way too time-consuming, or they are so limiting that they don't give you any real indication of why you are playing better or worse. With our automated statistical analysis, we can provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extremely detailed stats covering dozens of categories</li>
<li>Stats on the individual golf clubs in your bag</li>
<li>Historical shot mapping</li>
<li>Golf shot tips before you swing your club</li>
<li>And much more.</li>

<h3>Help Us Raise Money for Our Mama</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Our Mom, Marie, is also a wife, daughter, sister, and grandmommy, and was diagnosed with Stage 4 Metastatic Breast Cancer.</p>
<p>Metastatic, means that it's spreading. And Stage 4, means--that it's time to get REAL. And by Real, we mean Serious.</p>
<p>Our experience with some Doctors when they've found out it's stage 4, have said things like, ""Well since it's stage 4, lets go ahead and just try to make you comfortable for the time you have left.""</p>
<p>Comforting...isn't it?</p>
<p>We didn't know how serious Cancer was until our Mom was diagnosed. We'd heard stories and read up on it some, but it was all pretty general. We didn't know that Breast Cancer is growing at alarmingly fast rates and that we had any power over preventing it or possibly even healing our bodies. </p>
<p><em>Our Mama, Marie has been NOTHING short of amazing throughout her whole journey... </em></p>
<p><em>She is a fighter and survivor and we know she will beat this!</em></p>
<p><em>Her example of courage, unwavering faith, determination, and positivity </em></p>
<p><em>have truly been an astounding, encouraging, &amp; downright incredible thing to witness!</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>We are proud to call Marie OUR AMAZING Mamacita/Mama-Bear &amp; we believe she deserves the best treatment &amp; care there is and w</em><em>e are determined to do everything we can to achieve that.</em></p>
<p>But we need your help.</p>
<p>She is receiving Integrative Treament but unfortunately most of the treatment is not covered by insurance. </p>
<p>Our family has completely exhausted all funds to pay for Mom's treatment.</p>
<p>So now, we are reaching out &amp; Asking for help. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mama lives in South Carolina and needs to travel across the country to Reno, NV to receive her treatment, where she will stay for several weeks.</p>

</div></div>","Help Us Raise Money for Our Mama
 
Our Mom, Marie, is also a wife, daughter, sister, and grandmommy, and was diagnosed with Stage 4 Metastatic Breast Cancer.
Metastatic, means that it's spreading. And Stage 4, means--that it's time to get REAL. And by Real, we mean Serious.
Our experience with some Doctors when they've found out it's stage 4, have said things like, ""Well since it's stage 4, lets go ahead and just try to make you comfortable for the time you have left.""
Comforting...isn't it?
We didn't know how serious Cancer was until our Mom was diagnosed. We'd heard stories and read up on it some, but it was all pretty general. We didn't know that Breast Cancer is growing at alarmingly fast rates and that we had any power over preventing it or possibly even healing our bodies. 
Our Mama, Marie has been NOTHING short of amazing throughout her whole journey... 
She is a fighter and survivor and we know she will beat this!
Her example of courage, unwavering faith, determination, and positivity 
have truly been an astounding, encouraging, & downright incredible thing to witness!
 
We are proud to call Marie OUR AMAZING Mamacita/Mama-Bear & we believe she deserves the best treatment & care there is and we are determined to do everything we can to achieve that.
But we need your help.
She is receiving Integrative Treament but unfortunately most of the treatment is not covered by insurance. 
Our family has completely exhausted all funds to pay for Mom's treatment.
So now, we are reaching out & Asking for help. 
 
Mama lives in South Carolina and needs to travel across the country to Reno, NV to receive her treatment, where she will stay for several weeks.


 


If you can't help with financial assistance, there is still more you can do.
You can donate SKYMILES.
Or Hotel Points, or any type of Transportation.
 
You can help us get the word out and make some noise about Marie's Fight for her Life. 
You can also donate on our website
www.PeaceLoveAndCancer.com  
(complete with Blogs, Vegan & Vegetarian Recipes, and Resources, in hopes to empower cancer patients and educate others on Integrative Therapies)
AND
 
We have some INCREDIBLE Auction ITEMS up for Grabs!!!
To make a BID on the Auction Items go to:
PEACELOVEANDCANCER.COM
 
AND
You can download Mama's Song by Annie Elie by clicking HERE
OR
You can shout about it from the rooftops (but we're not sure how much that will do) except for maybe annoy your neighbors... 
 
You can also use the Indiegogo share tools!
We live in an incredible era of Social Media.
Between Facebook, Twitter, Pintrest, Myspace (Well...does anyone still get on myspace anymore? ;), and Email- this is the quickest way to spread the word. 
 
And if you can't do anything else...
 
Please send Prayers and Positive Thoughts and Good Vibes.
 
Mom is a woman of Faith and we are believing that God is going to heal her and she will go on to live an incredible life with an Amazing Testimony to share and impact others. We believe in MIRACLES!
Any and all help is incredibly appreciated.

<p>We at the High 5 Running Club (H5RC) love to run but hate the fact that it's often such a solitary activity. We want to make running more social by connecting individuals through the simple medium of the ""High 5"".</p>
<p>With its roots in London, New York, and California we hope the High 5 Running Club will appeal to all you run- and fun-lovers out there so that we can banish the lonely jog for good.</p>
<h2>What we do and how do you get involved...</h2>
<p>By buying a High 5 Running Club shirt, the idea is that you throw it on every time you go for a run and that by wearing it, other runners will see the distinctive design and line up to give you what we've found to be the best performance enhancing booster on the right side of the law, a High 5! It's really that simple.</p>
<h2><strong>High 5 Running Club Days</strong></h2>
<p>To help get the High 5 ball rolling, we are dedicating 1 January 2013 as our first official ""High 5 Running Club Day"". We will be arranging five High 5 Running Club Days each year, each with a separate theme/cause - follow H5RC on Twitter and Facebook to keep up to date with plans for the following events.</p>
<p>On every official High 5 Running Club Day, members of the H5RC will wear one of our shirts out running (no matter where they are in the world) and high five everyone they pass on their runs.</p>
<p>We want to see photos, videos and stories up on the H5RC website so we can see that the word is spreading.</p>
<p>For our first official H5RC day on New Years Day 2013, we hope the joy of the night before will help break down any awkward social barriers and the high 5's will flow naturally!</p>
<h2>Thanks...and we hope to see you out there in a H5RC shirt soon!</h2>

<p><strong>My Dad, My Best Friend, My Hero</strong></p>
<p>My dad was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis at the age of 29. For those of you who don't know what that is, it's the inflammation of joints in your body. Rheumatoid Arthritis may occasionally affect the skin, eyes, lungs, heart, blood or nerves. While the exact cause of arthritis is still unknown, some suggest that a virus or bacteria alters the immune system, causing it to attack the joints. That leads to damaging inflammation, and wears down the cartilage. As the cartilage wears down, the space between the bones narrows. If conditions worsen, the bones could rub against each other. It’s a disease that unfortunately affects over a million people in the United States alone.</p>
<p>This is what’s happening to my dad. He’s 54 years old and he’s had Arthroscopic Knee Surgery, both knees replaced, and a Triple Arthodesis (where the 3 main joints of his right hindfoot were fused). I foresee more surgeries in his future, unless this new medication works for him. It’s called Rituxan. Of all the medications he’s tried in the past, this one has helped him the most with just one does. Rituxan is administered through an IV every six months, which is probably why it’s so costly. I wish I had the money he needed to pay for his treatments myself but life does not allow it.</p>
<p>I can’t explain the pain my dad is going through. I can only describe what it's like to see him on his bad days. We take so much for granted. Simple tasks like brushing his teeth or combing his hair seem almost impossible some days. Tying his shoes, putting on a shirt are daunting tasks at times. His elbows, wrists, and shoulders are limiting his movements. I can’t image what it feels like to have your body betray you every day. To take medication that might help with the pain for a few hours but ends up damaging another part of his body. Medication that over time has made him so weak we almost lost him a couple of years ago. Many of you that know my dad, do not know that last part but it’s true.</p>
<p>I’m asking for help on behalf of my dad, my best friend, my hero. I can NOT image my life without him. I hate to see him in so much pain. This fundraiser will only be up for a short time. Even if we don’t meet our goal, any contributions will be a huge help. My dad always wears a smile no matter what how much pain he’s in. Please help me lessen his pain and help him live a semi-normal life.</p>

<p><b>Butterflies BBI</b> is a 501c3 non-profit organization which was created to address the needs of children suffering from hair loss due to Alopecia and other medical conditions.  We have a special interest in inner city kids as they are often a group that is overlooked.  At Butterflies, our mission is to help create a sense of normalcy and wellbeing to our children as they deal with their personal illnesses and conditions by providing them with age appropriate high quality hair replacements. We know that parents are busy.  Juggling work, raising a family and caring for each child's individual needs is time consuming.  We recognize the time constraints so, to lighten the load, we do all the legwork to ensure that our clients receive  all the services they deserve.  Some of our services include matching  clients with the  highest quality  hair replacements  <b>and the best stylists, </b>in order to create that natural age appropriate look.  And most importantly, all our services are completely <b>FREE OF CHARGE </b>to clients 18 and under.</p>
<p><b>What makes Butterflies BBI different, is that we also know life is busy, so to maker life easier, we come to you!  We make home visits and provide transportation to scheduled appointments if needed.  We also work around the schedules of all caregivers.  So, if a mom or a grandma has to leave for work at 6am and will return at 8pm, we can accommodate them with a 5:30am or 8:30pm home visit to complete our application process.  Pretty neat!</b></p>
<p>The reality of it is that we live in a society where appearance and acceptance in young girls can be a turning point in regards to their self-esteem.  We believe that by helping to restore normalcy to our clients now, while they deal with their personal conditions and illnesses, we can assist in raising their self-esteem which will contribute to a happier more confident future.  In addition to our hair replacement program, our clients can also elect to participate in our Pink Butterflies program which offers self-esteem workshops and healthy eating seminars.  At Butterflies, we truly care about our clients' well-being and enjoy assisting with this part of their journey.</p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP:</b><br/></p>
<p>Although running a non-profit organization feeds our passion to help children, we do encounter expenses.  The cost of medical wigs can reach upwards of $6000.  We need your help to cover the cost of a  custom medical wig for a young girl who has been living with Alopecia for over 10 years.  She's such a special girl and a great student but has unfortunately been the victim of bullying and harassment due to her condition.  She's also worn traditional wigs which have been removed by other insensitive students in school, because they were not secure enough or customized.  Medical  wigs with suction caps are a better solution as they are custom made to fit securely, which makes them harder to remove and they look more natural.  They also require a lot of time and effort to create.  The steps include taking a mold of the head, creating a hand made unit and  fitting sessions.  This process can take  several weeks and, according to most providers, the costs begin  at $3500 and can reach $6500. </p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Your contributions will go toward covering the  total cost of a custom hair replacement and will be completely tax deductible!  Please help us lighten the load of children who are deserving but often underserved.</b></p>
<p>If our goal is met, we can immediately start the process of fitting this young lady for her much deserved, new medical wig. (A photo of her condition can be seen above but due to confidentiality guidelines, we can not show her face.) All additional funds will go towards providing  traditional hair replacements, caps ,wraps and services to  other clients in need.  Funds are always needed to help us help other children dealing with their conditions.  And remember, <b>all donations are tax deductible.</b></p>
<p><b> </b></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>In order to truly understand the impact of the services our clients receive, you would have  had to actually witness their transformations.  According to our parents and caregivers, children who have once shied away from enjoying the day to day activities, that we  so often take for granted, have now become active participants in life.  We have seen our girls blossom and look forward to their futures.  No more shying away from get-togethers, we encourage our girls to get out and live!</div> <p>Thats why we believe it's <b>so</b> important to raise the self-esteem of our clients sooner than later,  and with your help, we can touch each life one girl at a time.  After all, these girls will eventually become adults and with the help of our Pink Butterflies  program, they will be healthy, happy  well balanced members of society.  So in essence, helping them now is creating a brighter future for all of us.</p>

<div><span>Fast forward. Year and three quarters. I somehow have ended up purchasing a mountain farm with my fiance and rekindled the passion for a healthy and vibrant community.</span></div>

That's pretty freakin' difficult.</span></div>

<p><br/>These aren't per-se, like anything you've ever experienced before. Up to fifty percent of these raw chocolates include adaptogenic herbs. These herbs have the amazing capability to give your body what it needs most.  In order for an herb to be classified as adaptogen, it must <em>restore balance</em> and <em>strengthen</em> the functioning of the body without throwing another organ or body system out of balance. <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-LpK78n46bmw/UH8fHftvDlI/AAAAAAAAABo/lSoCoz9hUn4/s640/blisschill.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Adaptogens facilitate these changes by a wide range of actions rather than just by one specific action. Of equal importance to the herb’s active properties is its safety—an adaptogen must be nontoxic and non-habit forming, even when taken over a long period of time. </p>

You arrive on the pacific coast of Mexico, after 36 hours on busses. you lose your glasses, only to arrive in the most beautiful place you've even been able (sorta) to see. Welcome to Mazunte.

 
I found a little yoga school up the hill from the towns claim to fame, the museo de tortuga.  Here I lived, worked, sweated and mostly smiled my way through six months of bliss. During a raw food workshop I was hosting, we conjured up Adaptozens, little herbal balls of bliss.
 
Fast forward. Year and three quarters. I somehow have ended up purchasing a mountain farm with my fiance and rekindled the passion for a healthy and vibrant community.
 
Our kitchen has turned into a culinary alchemical madhouse. Using our knowledge of all sects of herbal medicine, along with our culinary mad genius, we've come up with these primitive raw chocolates that satisfy the gourmand, the weekend warrior and the vegan purist. That's pretty freakin' difficult.
 
We combine local herbs with hand selected raw ingredients. Elaborating on the spectrum of human experience, we selected thus far to explore the themes of Bliss, vitality, wiseness and peace.  Extracting from these palettes are the tastes, textures, and herbal alchemy that we meld together in the form of chocolate.

<p>Ninety-three percent of Maasai girls go through a mandatory ritual of having their clitoris cut off at puberty, signifying their transition from childhood to adulthood. It also means they have to discontinue school and are married off, some as young as 11, 12 or 13 years old!  Ending the practice of female genital mutilation or cutting (FGM) allows young girls to stay in school and postpone marriage until they have finished at least high school. </p>
<p>Not only are there emotional and physical consequences with FGM, there are serious health risks, such as shock, hemorrhage, HIV/AIDS, damage to the urethra resulting in urinary incontinence, infection and severe scar formation, dyspareunia (painful sexual intercourse), infertility, and death.

<p>In August of 2012, with the help of the Maasai, <em>Africa Schools of Kenya</em> designed the Alternative Rite of Passage (ARP) Program, and the first-ever 2-day ARP ceremony was conducted with 52 girls!

Our goal is for the ARP Program to grow and eventually be used throughout Kenya as a new sustainable “coming of age” ceremony.
The money raised through this campaign will fund 15 Alternative Rite of Passage (ARP) ceremonies (50+ girls per ceremony) over the next 5 years.
By 2017, at least 750 girls from Esiteti will be uncircumcised, and over 200 women will be trained to conduct their own ARP program due to the Life-Skill and ARP Training Program. Neighboring villages have already asked how they can start an ARP program.
Other Ways To Help
Please ""SHARE"" our Alternative Rite of Passage program and the Workshops for the women on your social media networks. These Maasai girls and women are worthy of our attention! EDUCATION is their only hope. By donating or spreading the word, you will help change the course of hundreds of girls and women's lives forever!",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

We have been conducting R&amp;D on an herbal tea that provides impressive, broad - based health benefits. Based upon scientific studies conducted on the Jiaogulan herb, we believe this tea may be one of the healthiest teas in the world. Re-3 has developed a branded line of Jiaogulan teas named Adaptix Multi - Health &amp; Weight - Loss Teas. The benefits provided by Adaptix Multi - Health Teas, target four of the most serious chronic health conditions facing many Americans today: diabetes/pre-diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol levels and weight/obesity issues. While Adaptix Multi - Health Teas are not a ""cure all"", these teas do provide broad - based health benefits that may help many people live healthier, happier and more productive lives. Re-3's goal is twofold. Improve people's lives by improving their health - making Adaptix Multi - Health Teas available to everyone and creating new jobs and opportunities for Americans by growing Jiaogulan tea in the US - not importing the tea as we presently do. You can help us accomplish these goals by donating funds to make this happen. Please share this campaign with family, friends, and co - workers. Thank you for your support and drink Adaptix Multi - Health Teas today and feel the difference!</p>
<p>The name of the herb/tea is Jiaogulan - botanically known as Gynostemma pentaphyllum. In South Central China where Jiaogulan was initially discovered, Jiaogulan is known as ""ziancao"" which translated means ""Immortality"". The people of Guizhou province gave this name to Jiaogulan tea due to the broad - based health benefits provided by drinking Jiaogulan tea - which included living longer, healthier lives. More than 300 scientific studies have been conducted validating the impressive health benefits of Jiaogulan. Today, Jiaogulan tea is also grown in Southeast Asia. Re-3 sources our organic Jiaogulan tea from Southeast Asia.   </p>
<p>Potential health benefits provided by Jiaogulan tea:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduction in insulin resistance, blood glucose and A1c</li>
<li>Reduction in high blood pressure</li>
<li>Reduction in LDL-C and Triglycerides</li>
<li>Potential weight - loss (we have seen individuals lose 20 pounds in 90 days)</li>
<li>Increase in Superoxide dismutase (SOD) the body's most powerful endogenous antioxidant - thought to be 3500% stronger as an antioxidant than vitamin C</li>
<li>Increase in white blood cell count (WBC) which benefits the immune system</li>
<li>Increase in energy and endurance</li>
<li>Reduction in stress</li>
</ul><p>We have developed a blended Organic/Kosher certified Jiaogulan tea product - Adaptix Multi - Health &amp; Weight - Loss Teas. Adaptix Multi - Health &amp; Weight - Loss Teas are available in Regular and Peach flavors with Apple - Cinnamon,Mango and Pomegranate flavors to be added. Recently formulated Adaptix Multi - Health Anti - Aging Tea, is a proprietary blend of Jiaogulan tea and Reishi mushroom. Reishi mushroom is known as the ""Mushroom of Immortality"" and the ""King of Herbs"" in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer are the #1 and #2 killers of US adults (CDC 2011). Jiaogulan tea can positively benefit CVD related health conditions while Reishi mushroom provides powerful chemo - preventitive (cancer prevention) benefits. Both Jiaogulan tea and Reishi mushroom provide additional synergistic health benefits. Adaptix Multi - Health Teas are naturally caffeine - free, taste great hot or iced and can be enjoyed by everyone.</p>
<p>Re-3 has completed the Adaptix Multi - Health Teas packaging and the adaptixtea.com web site (we need to add our Anti-Aging tea) - thanks to the help of family members and friends. We have lined up our direct marketing partners who include: Everyday Health (the #1 internet health web site), RealAge (Dr. Oz/Dr. Roizen's web site), Prevention Magazine, AARP, LifeScript.com, etc. Re-3 has also developed Q- ardio (pronounced cardio), a healthy sports nutrition supplement successfully used by Coach Peter Smith (the Head Tennis Coach at USC) and his athletes.

<h3>In Feb 2011, my husband went to the Hospital with what he presumed was a dizzy spell.</h3>
<p>He failed the hand to nose test and was sent to a second hospital which performed a ct scan. The ct scan showed that he had a stroke and needed further Testing at yet a third hospital located an hour away from our home.  At about 10 pm that same evening I arrived at the hospital to find a very confused staff in the stroke ward where my husband was located.  </p>
<p>  I can remember getting upset as the nurses came into his Room with a booklet of information on how to learn the signs of a stroke. I felt like my cooking was killing him and felt completely responsible for it.  But My husbands cholesterol, blood pressure and heart were all healthy after testing over twenty vials of blood. It was then decided that he get further testing as the stroke made no sence at the time to anyone including myself.  He got an MRI and a few hours later a mass was found in his brain. It was then determined it was not a stroke but seizures. Strokes and seizures all show up the same on ct scans, but are different on MRIs as they are more detailed. </p>
<p>We were very scared. Doctors could not provide much information to us until it was Biopsied.</p>
<p>A few days spent in the hospital, a biopsy to determine its grade and it felt like our world was coming down. We were beyond scared. A family to raise Bills to pay and we were already living paycheck to paycheck just like everyone else we knew. We got help from my mom who did a lot to help us keep a roof over our heads. My husband was unable to work and his job offered no disability at that time. What could we do? He got the biopsy and was released two days later to rest at home.</p>
<p>  A few weeks later the results came back inconclusive, so a few weeks later we made an  appointment at the cancer center in Baltimore, Maryland to get a second opinion of his tumor.  We came back home with the same results and were still feeling pretty overwhelmed.  It was then determined to be a grade two glioma lower frontal temporal lobe brain tumor. Talked big words! </p>
<p>On top of it all, His medication needed to be adjusted several times before returning to work on a trial basis.  That late June he returned to work only to miss a week of work almost every month because of pill adjustments. We learned there are approximately 28 different seizure preventative pills on the market and the trick was to find which combo worked best for him.</p>
<p>  In October we were referred to a neurologist who worked closely with him to find the perfect dose and combo of medication.  A few months later with bills and medication costs still piling up, he began to have seizures yet again! </p>
<p>  It was eventually suggested by his neurologist and neurosurgeon that he have as much of the tumor (that was also wrapped around his main artery) removed that was safe For him. After a few weeks of thought, my husband agreed.  I can be honest in saying i was so afraid of losing him, it took lots of convincing me to support his decision. Selfish? Yes. But more terrified than anything else. After a six and a half hour surgery, March 2012, about 75% was removed successfully.   We still dont have exact amounts because the brain is still swollen but he will always have tumor in him as they were unable to remove it all without damaging or paralyzing him. We do know It went from about the size of a large egg to about the size of a half dollar.</p>
<p>My husband has been out of work since his operation and is unable to return at this time.  We've been turned down for financial help, on just about every other door we've tried to open. Something needs to be done!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  He was fortunate that the company he works for finally got disability insurance (because of him) so we were able to qualify for short term for 13 weeks. It has run out as of june 21st and we were turned down for Long Term due to it being an apparent ""pre existing"" condition.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That's been a fight too. We keep arguing with them that he just needs more time to heal.</p>
<p>Most of our monthly bills cannot be paid. Noone will help, but we've been active on keeping on top of things, and some bill collectors have been sympathetic for our situation, they still want to set up a payment date.  It has been a rough and frightening road traveled.</p>
<p>After all that he's already been through- We have then learned that Behind the tumor is also a spot of cancer. He will need 6 months of chemotherapy treatments, perhaps more we cannot cross that bridge until we get to it.</p>
<p>  After 32 treatments of chemo and radiation, traveling over an hour every day for treatments with weekends off,  he is now recuperating, and they are keeping a close eye on the tumor with an MRI every three months.  The radiation lasts in the body long after treatments are over, and he is constantly fatigued, and has short term memory damage, tremors, and is very impulsive and more... He has become a different person. Who wouldn't though. His body has been through a lot, it will take time to heal.</p>
<p>I am worried sick. Losing it all (mortgage and basic utilities) scares me less than losing him.</p>
<p>Through this rough road we have learned a valuable lesson to learn to take life day by day. But it is often hard to focus on that lesson until we are reminded that life could get much worse. We will always have each other and our gorgeous three year old son gets us through each and every single day. Life is precious.  </p>
<p>  The funds received will help to alleviate the two hundred dollar a month medication burden as well as getting caught up on past due bills incurred throughout this entire ordeal.  </p>
<p>Words of wisdom and encouragement , positive vibes, all is welcomed and appreciated. Grey Matters is the theme for brain cancer awareness  it is the color of brain cancer awareness ribbons.</p>
<p>Additionally I would like to thank the following people- my mom and best friend, (Mary Ann) for everything you have done for us and still do every single day. We love you so much!  My mother in law (Denise) for having such a positive outlook through it all. I will never understand how you were able to hold it all together as I was falling apart. Lots of love and respect to you.  My sister in law aka Fuffy for holding my hand and your emotional support. You are Such a strong young lady! PS: Brownie points?  My father for keeping tabs on us and helping when you could. We love you!

</div></div>","Short Summary
Most of us take our good health for granted.  However, more than 50 million of us don't have health insurance and thus don't take advantage of basic, preventative healthcare services.
50 million.  That's a problem.  Be part of the solution.  As Ghandi said ""Be the change you wish to see in the world.""  That's what I'm doing.
I'm Chris Pantuso, Founder & Executive Director of The Calabria Foundation.  Learn more about me by clicking here.  Learn more about the Foundation and our plans to roll out a fleet of mobile medical units by clicking here.

<p>Aloha,</p>
<p>My name is Ikelene. This campaign was put together by friends and fellow volunteers. I am humbled by this whole experience. I have dedicated my whole life to fundraising, charity work, and end of life services. I never dreamed of a day when there would be such an outpouring of support for my needs. A lifetime of undiagnosed systemic lupus has meant years of medications that masked the symptoms and damaged my body. I even had my large intestine removed. I jokingly call myself ""Gutless Wonder"". Nothing short of a miracle resulted in my diagnosis just a few months ago. Unfortunately I am losing my hearing and one of the medications I am on could cause vision loss in as little as six months. My kidneys and liver are also under attack. I decided to seek alternative treatment. An Oasis of Healing has been the only alternative treatment center to accept my request. They believe I can be healed in approximately four weeks. Treatment is expensive, but highly effective. I just want to get back to giving back. Any contribution will go to helping more than one woman get well. It will help me help others.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>An Oasis of Healing estimates I will benefit from 4 weeks of treatment:</p>
<p><strong>Treatments:</strong></p>
<p>Complete blood work / Hormone panel / Unine Toxic Metals testing / Intravenous Therapeutic Vitamin C / Chelation (EDTA) / Ultraviolet Blood Irridation (UBI) / Autohemotherapy / Ozone and Hydrogen Peroxide / Supervised Juice Feast / Lymphatic Massage / Acupuncture / Yoga / Reflection Meditation</p>
<p>Treatment can range from $2,800 - $4,500 per week</p>
<p>Lodging (depending on how soon our goal is reached and availability ) $1,500- $2,500 for a month</p>
<p>Car Rental $850- $1,000 for a month</p>
<p>Round Trip Air Fair for two (a companion is recommended) approximately $1,000</p>
<p>Estimated living expenses approximately $1,000.</p>
<p>This is a total of only $22,500 in the most expensive scenario, but all donations not used to heal me will go towards healing others. I truly hope to exceed this goal, so that we can make a difference in the lives of others who need treatment and support. This is not just about me.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is a section that has limitless potential if we all come together. The donations are about getting me well so I can get on about helping others. This is about shedding light on alternatives to surgeries, and prescription drugs. It's community at its finest. We all deserve to be supported and sometimes that just means giving someone a voice.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you are not able to donate please give this campaign a voice. There is inspiration in this message. Let's spread the word.</p>
<p>Please use the indiegogo share tools too.</p>

<p class=""ecxMsoNormal"">My name is Gacia Hajinian. I am a Canadian-born and raised teenager. I just graduated from high school with honours and as an Ontario Scholar. I am appealing to you to help me raise funds for my mother’s life-saving spine surgery. My 52-year-old mother, Sevan Hajinian, is one of the most dedicated people in our community. For more than 25 years she was a volunteer in the Canadian Civil Society, helping people who are in need, regardless of their religion, colour or race. She was a youth leader, school board trustee, a member of the parents and teachers committee, and church auxiliary committee. She also volunteered in social services, immigration, and as a government relations adviser. She also raised funds for a variety of worthwhile and charitable causes. My mother has always been a hard-working woman with high moral ethics. She instilled in my sister and I the same values and encouraged us to follow her example. </p>
<p class=""ecxMsoNormal""><span>My mother is suffering from a debilitating spinal illness which has had a devastating impact on her life and curtailed her church, community, social, and family life. </span></p>

<p class=""ecxMsoNormal""><strong><span>My Mother's Story</span></strong></p>
<p class=""ecxMsoNormal""><span>In the last four years my mother has seen five Ontario spine surgeons, two neurologists, and one neurosurgeon. Two Canadian spine surgeons have refused to see her. The only recommendation for treatment they have suggested was the traditional morphine-based medication. </span><span>One Toronto spine doctor told her “when you are in wheelchair come and see me and we will do something.”</span> </p>
<p class=""ecxMsoNormal""><span>The Health Services Appeal and Review Board Panel (Ontario government health care insurance), which consisted of three people, all with a financial background and none with a medical background, released a decision not to fund her surgery in New York. This is a travesty of justice. My mother was denied natural justice and procedural fairness. The Board ignored critical testimony and facts which are crucial to rendering a fair and just decision.</span></p>
<p class=""ecxMsoNormal""><span>Award-winning journalist Roy Green, on his blog, summed up the urgency of the issue as follows: ""Sevan Hajinian of Toronto is in need of specialized back surgery. No Ontario surgeon she has spoken will agree to do the procedure because they say it's too complicated. Ms. Hajinian has found a surgeon in New York who has the expertise, but Ontario's health insurance plan will not pay for the $200,000 procedure."" </span></p>
<p class=""ecxMsoNormal""><span><br/></span><span><br/><strong><span>The Impact</span></strong></span> </p>
<p class=""ecxMsoNormal""><span>If my mother is not operated by the spine surgery specialist she will become paralyzed, have kidney and liver failure (because of morphine-based drugs) and has a high chance of becoming victim of MS due to lack of blood circulation to her brain. <span>She takes eight Percocets a day to control her pain.</span> Due to the stress of my mother’s illness, my father suffered a stroke.</span></p>
<p class=""ecxMsoNormal""><span>A few months ago my family and friends launched a fundraising campaign, with the help of the Bishop of the Canadian-Armenian Church. <span>In the last three months many people demonstrated their sympathy and solidarity through generous contributions.

<p class=""ecxMsoNormal""><span>But my mother needs further assistance: we have not been able to raise the amount of money to cover her surgery expenses. We need to double our fundraising efforts. Therefore, I have set up this campaign to reach out to a much larger group of compassionate individuals and organizations.  </span></p>

<p><strong>Dear</strong> community members of indiegogo, thank you for taking the time to visit this <span style=""font-size: 10px;"">page.</span></p>
<p><strong>Campaign</strong></p>
<p>I arrange this campaign in order to raise money for a russian girl whose name is Kate Guseva. Doctors diagnosed her with a disease that diractly affects locomotive functions of her legs. Now she is incapable of walking without the help of her nearest and dearest. </p>
<p><strong>Funding</strong></p>
<p>The target sum of money that will cover medical costs is 40,000 $. 50% of this amount is assumed by the charity foundation ""Little Heroes"" (<a href=""http://www.littleheroesfoundation.com.au/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.littleheroesfoundation.com.au/</a>), 25% are agreed to be paid by the fund of the Ministry of Health of Russian Federation. The left 10K $ need to be raised as soon as possible. Apart from medical costs the stipulated sum of money comprises the cost of aeroplane ticket for Kate and her mother and living costs in Germany, where the surgery will be carried out. <em><br/></em></p>
<p><strong>Perks</strong></p>
<p>Dear contributors, the only perk I can offer you is the photo of recovered Kate taking a promenade with her mother. Moreover, please follow the updates I will add regularly.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Kate will undergo surgery on the 16th of April 2013. All Kate's friends are striving to help funding the medical costs of the oncoming surgery but their efforts are not enough. I have seen numerous fabulous campaigns that significantly changed people's lives to the better. This is why I on behalf of those who are not indifferent to Kate's fate address this matter to the generous community of the Indiegogo. </p>
<p>Please, help Kate to walk again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>P.S. I want to clarify last but not the least aspect of the campaign. Kate asked me not to upload any pictures of her or spread her personal details due to the nature of her disease. I appreciate her will. However, if you find necessary to tell her anything or feel the need to ask anything please contact me via email <a href=""mailto:ao.alexeev@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ao.alexeev@gmail.com</a> or skype: februaryvictoria.

<p>I am a registered nurse from Tennessee and back in February
of this year I realized that I had a problem with alcohol. I was not in trouble with work or law enforcement, I have never gone to work impaired or hungover, I wanted to get help before any thing like that happened and I hurt someone else or myself. I went in search for help out of the knowledge that I had a problem that I had tried to solve myself but failed to do so.  </p>
<p>I sought out help through my employer and went inpatient to
detox. After 3 days my doctor told me that I was to be discharged and that I need
to set up some out patient treatment and one on one counseling as well. I would
be able to return to work in a week. </p>
<p>When I went for my first counseling session, which I was
doing through my employer, I was asked a lot of questions. One question was
whether or not I had had any law enforcement issues due to alcohol. I told them
that I had had a DUI last year and that my employer knew about this before
hiring me. Well, the EAP office, which I was getting counseling through, said
they did not know about it and even though it was on my application, resume,
and work record and even though my managers and human resources knew about it I
shouldn’t have been hired without an assessment. </p>
<p>I was sent to a treatment facility and told I would have a
week long assessment and then would have to follow what ever plan of treatment
was recommended for me. I was told not to worry and the most it would be was a
month. </p>
<p>My recommendations were 12 weeks of rehab followed by 6
months of sober living. During this time I would no be allowed to work as an RN
and if I did not complete this treatment plan the board of nursing would be
informed and my license revoked or suspended. </p>
<p>The total cost of this treatment is going to be around
$50,000. I have already paid through help of family and friends $30,000. I am
at my wits end and have no other resources available to me. I have completed
the 12 weeks of rehab with no problems. I am very grateful for the treatment I have
gotten and I have no desire to drink or cravings or ill effects ongoing. But I do
have a huge debt to pay and I cannot complete my sober living without $20,000. </p>
<p>So I am asking for help. I know a lot of people will say
that I put myself in this position by drinking, and yes, I did do just that. But
I was cleared to return to work before I was told to get this treatment and I had
been sober for 2 weeks. Also, one of the things I learned in treatment was that
as an alcoholic I have to learn to ask for help. I have to learn to turn to
others when I am unable to do for myself. This not asking for help is one thing
that will lead a person right back to drink. </p>
<p>So here I am. Asking humbly for assistance so that I may
return to the career I love and more importantly get all the help I can to
continue the sobriety that I have enjoyed for the last three months and hope to
continue for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>Thank you. <font><span style="""">A heartfelt thank you. It's all I can offer at the moment. After I get back to work and on my feet financially I will start repaying everyone who contributes. It will take time but it will be done.  </span></font></p><p><font><span style="""">Thanks. </span></font></p>

I went in search for help out of the knowledge that I had a problem that I had tried to solve myself but failed to do so.  
I sought out help through my employer and went inpatient to
detox. After 3 days my doctor told me that I was to be discharged and that I need
to set up some out patient treatment and one on one counseling as well. I would
be able to return to work in a week. 
When I went for my first counseling session, which I was
doing through my employer, I was asked a lot of questions. One question was
whether or not I had had any law enforcement issues due to alcohol. I told them
that I had had a DUI last year and that my employer knew about this before
hiring me. Well, the EAP office, which I was getting counseling through, said
they did not know about it and even though it was on my application, resume,
and work record and even though my managers and human resources knew about it I
shouldn’t have been hired without an assessment. 
I was sent to a treatment facility and told I would have a
week long assessment and then would have to follow what ever plan of treatment
was recommended for me. I was told not to worry and the most it would be was a
month. 
My recommendations were 12 weeks of rehab followed by 6
months of sober living. During this time I would no be allowed to work as an RN
and if I did not complete this treatment plan the board of nursing would be
informed and my license revoked or suspended. 
The total cost of this treatment is going to be around
$50,000. I have already paid through help of family and friends $30,000. I am
at my wits end and have no other resources available to me. I have completed
the 12 weeks of rehab with no problems. I am very grateful for the treatment I have
gotten and I have no desire to drink or cravings or ill effects ongoing. But I do
have a huge debt to pay and I cannot complete my sober living without $20,000. 
So I am asking for help. I know a lot of people will say
that I put myself in this position by drinking, and yes, I did do just that. But
I was cleared to return to work before I was told to get this treatment and I had
been sober for 2 weeks. Also, one of the things I learned in treatment was that
as an alcoholic I have to learn to ask for help. I have to learn to turn to
others when I am unable to do for myself. This not asking for help is one thing
that will lead a person right back to drink. 
So here I am. Asking humbly for assistance so that I may
return to the career I love and more importantly get all the help I can to
continue the sobriety that I have enjoyed for the last three months and hope to
continue for the rest of my life.
Thank you. A heartfelt thank you. It's all I can offer at the moment. After I get back to work and on my feet financially I will start repaying everyone who contributes. It will take time but it will be done.  Thanks.

Dega Schembri and Lucinda LaRee, we are the longest standing woman-owned
fitness business in Washington. As owner-operators, we remain
fully involved in day-to-day activities as Personal Trainers, Group

<p>City Fitness Gym believes in Doing Well and Doing Good – we have supported many local, national and international charities. We’ve

our annual Fitness Fiesta Fundraisers, we have given back to the community

<p>Being small in a world of big box facilities, a woman-owned gym
in a male-dominated field, and a friendly, neighborhood business in an ever-
growing isolated world, we face the challenge of staying competitive. We have
invested in our physical space constantly through the years with new equipment,
new floors, painting, updating our accessories, and improving our customer
service and staff education. In 2014, we began a major capital improvement
campaign: with assistance from the Great Streets Grant we partially refurbished
our locker rooms and replaced our aged fitness floor A/V equipment. In 2015, we
are poised to finish the locker room upgrades, replace our HVAC system, upgrade
our cardiovascular machines and more. The Great Streets Grant will help us with
some of this, but we want to do so much more. </p>
<p><b>You and Your Impact:</b></p>
<p>We strive to keep our costs competitive, and to do that our budget does not
allow for the upgrades to our weight room equipment and other parts of our A/V
systems. There are 4 weight room pieces that could be more user-friendly -
especially for our more mature members while, at the same time, still serving
our elite athletes.  Our televisions are very old and are difficult to see
on some cardio machines.</p>
<p>Our campaign to raise $10,000.00 will allow us to begin the effort of
replacing these items. We face fierce competition with the ever-growing
large chains of the gym industry and struggle to keep up the costly equipment
changes needed to stay cutting edge. Help us achieve this goal while still
allowing us to optimally service the diverse demographics that our gym
proudly attracts.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, we will purchase as many pieces of equipment as

<h2><font color=""00a7ec"">Why Crowdfund the Ambrosia?</font></h2><p>Although we have seen success with our flagship product, the X1 Orgasmatron, we are still just a tiny company- there are less than 10 of us! We are asking for your help in this campaign so that we can:</p><ol>
<li><p>Cover manufacturing costs. Making stuff is expensive! There are a number of up-front capital investment costs that we need to pay for before we can bring Ambrosia to you. The money raised in this campaign will help us cover prototyping and parts, as well as shipping and consultation fees.  </p></li>
<li><p>Support and celebrate sexual and gender diversity. The Ambrosia allows users to play in a completely novel way. Our hope with this toy and this campaign is that we can work together to open up a dialogue about body exploration and build the conversation about intimacy and pleasure.</p></li>

</h3><p>Doctor X. Treme is the inventor of our flagship product, the X1 Orgasmatron. He is also CEO and co-founder of Orgasmatronics, Inc.</p><p>When Doctor X. Treme was a child he dreamed of becoming an inventor. His aspirations led him to the field of physics and his studies earned him a PhD from Yale University. After graduation the Doctor took a job in a government lab. He spent the next six years erecting quantum measurement devices for low temperature physics. While the work was engaging, Treme found it constricting and oppressive, like wearing pants. He grew weary of the military’s involvement in his field. To the Doctor, applied physics was about more than advanced weaponry.</p><p>One fateful night, his wife made a simple request. “Build me a sex machine?” she asked. And just like that, Doctor X. Treme quit his government job, took off his pants, and got to work.</p><p>These days, the Doctor dedicates his time to coupling science and technology in the bedroom. He researches ways to use physical principles to enhance the lives of (extra)ordinary people. And in his spare time, he ceaselessly battles injustice while exploring time and space in his unreliable time machine. Okay, that last bit isn’t true... yet.</p><br/><h3>

First things first:1. All backers have the option to remain 100% ANONYMOUS. Simply check “Don’t display my name” when you are making a payment. 2. Science is sexy, but sometimes you want that sexiness to be subtle. We understand. Every order will be shipped via USPS in a discreet, brown box addressed from Boulder Applied Physics (the actual name of our company). Nothing on the outside of your package will identify the fun inside ;)The Ambrosia Vibe is a new type of strap-on dildo that responds to touch. The unique Ambrosia Pressure Sense Technology™ perceives motion on the dildo and transfers sensation to the user via a vibrator at the base of the unit. The Ambrosia Vibe allows the strap-on wearer to actually ""feel"" the sexual stimulation applied to the dildo!
We believe this is a game-changing toy with all sorts of awesome possibilities for gender bending and body hacking. Be 1 of 200 people that own the Ambrosia Vibe for $50 off the retail price when you pre-order during our Indiegogo campaign. The Ambrosia is specifically designed to be very, very simple to use, to do what all good technology should do: disappear and let the user get on with their business.“One of the most liberating uses for technology in general is to free individuals from the constraints of their bodies, whether it’s letting us see things hundreds of miles away, fly, or live underwater. Our technology lets people not born with a biological penis have a richer experience as they play with sensation of their new ‘organ.’ We hope that this improves people’s lives and makes them happier with whatever their sexual and gender identity are.” --Dr. X. Treme, inventor
Ways to Use | Why | Technology | Team | People are Saying | FAQs | SupportersAmbrosia Touch Response: A “vein” that senses pressure from massage with the mouth, hand, and other parts of the body runs along the underside of the Ambrosia dildo. The pressure applied to this vein is transmitted via a tube to the control box. The control box measures pressure using some extremely sexy math (see image below), and the bullet vibe in the base of the dildo vibrates in response. The strap-on is designed to be worn in a harness with the base positioned against the wearer’s clitoris, so they can feel the stimulation.Ways to Play with Ambrosia:

Why Crowdfund the Ambrosia?Although we have seen success with our flagship product, the X1 Orgasmatron, we are still just a tiny company- there are less than 10 of us! We are asking for your help in this campaign so that we can:
Cover manufacturing costs. Making stuff is expensive! There are a number of up-front capital investment costs that we need to pay for before we can bring Ambrosia to you. The money raised in this campaign will help us cover prototyping and parts, as well as shipping and consultation fees.  
Support and celebrate sexual and gender diversity. The Ambrosia allows users to play in a completely novel way. Our hope with this toy and this campaign is that we can work together to open up a dialogue about body exploration and build the conversation about intimacy and pleasure.

 Dr. X. Treme
Doctor X. Treme is the inventor of our flagship product, the X1 Orgasmatron. He is also CEO and co-founder of Orgasmatronics, Inc.When Doctor X. Treme was a child he dreamed of becoming an inventor. His aspirations led him to the field of physics and his studies earned him a PhD from Yale University. After graduation the Doctor took a job in a government lab. He spent the next six years erecting quantum measurement devices for low temperature physics. While the work was engaging, Treme found it constricting and oppressive, like wearing pants. He grew weary of the military’s involvement in his field. To the Doctor, applied physics was about more than advanced weaponry.One fateful night, his wife made a simple request. “Build me a sex machine?” she asked. And just like that, Doctor X. Treme quit his government job, took off his pants, and got to work.These days, the Doctor dedicates his time to coupling science and technology in the bedroom. He researches ways to use physical principles to enhance the lives of (extra)ordinary people. And in his spare time, he ceaselessly battles injustice while exploring time and space in his unreliable time machine. Okay, that last bit isn’t true... yet.

<h3>Hello All.  My name is Tiffini.  I'm originally from Grinnell, Iowa, but have been living in Des Moines, Iowa for about 3 years now. I'm currently a student of mortuary science at Des Moines Area Community College with an anticipated graduation date of May 2014.  Being in this profession is something I've always wanted to do, but didn't have the guts for until I was laid off from my job on December 31, 2010.  And if I was having any doubts about this profession, those were squashed when my father passed away at the age of 57 from sudden cardiac death on August 3rd, 2011. The funeral home that handled his final wishes was comforting and competent, and I want to be able to provide that service to others that are grieving.  </h3>
<p><strong>This campaign has the potential to give me my life back.</strong>  </p>
<p>Way back when, when I was just 12 years old, a little friend visited me.  The same friend that visits all girls that age.  My... *shhhhh*... period.  I'll try to keep the graphic details to a minimum, but make no promises.  </p>
<p>It wasn't anything like those little films they show to kids.  There was no celebration, no hugs from family and friends because I'd ""become a woman."" BAH.  There was just tooth grinding pain.  For several years I just dealt with it, occassionally complaining to my mom about how much it hurt.  Sometimes, if I couldn't stop crying and screaming from the hurt, she'd let me stay home from school.  </p>
<p>When I reached high school I talked to my doctor about my situation and she gave me birth control pills.  This helped take the edge off, but I still cringed with fear every 28 days and still had to miss class occassionally.  When I entered college in 2000, I was put on a different kind of birth control pill.  This one did a slightly better job at keeping the pain and bleeding under control.  Throughout college I was plagued by lady issues of a yeasty and bacterial nature.  </p>
<p>Out of college, things started to get more serious, pain and bleeding wise.  I asked a gynecologist if I could have a laparoscopy done to check for anything abnormal, but was told my symptoms didn't really warrant the surgery.  I saw about 5 more doctors after that.  One told me I was fine.  Another told me it was in my head.  Another ordered a transvaginal ultrasound.  When I asked for the results, I was told everything was fine and led out of the room.</p>
<p>In 2007 I finally got my way after LOTS of complaining.  My doctor sent me to a specialist for a laparoscopy referral.  The doctor I saw didn't seem to take me seriously at first, but then she got a fax from the office that had done my ultrasound.  She asked if I had ever been told what the results were.  I let her know they told me everything was a-okay.  She freaked out.  She told me I had nodes all over my uterus and ovaries that could be a whole range of problems, so I had the laparoscopy.  Inside they found stage 3 endometriosis, with the buildup of adhesions on my left ovary being so thick that it was literally stuck on my uterus.  </p>
<p>Immediately after the surgery I was put on a high dose of progesterone to make my lady flow stop.  Any bleeding would bring more adhesions, more problems, and more pain.  I was completely happy with this until I noticed my clothes started getting smaller.  I was avidly exercising, switching between swimming, weight training, treadmill and arc trainer.  I was in good health at about 170-175 lbs.  After a couple months of hormones I had put on 15 pounds.  I read several forums regarding gaining weight on this particular drug, and 20 pounds seemed to be the limit for weight gain for everyone else.  I was fine with that, just as long as my pain was gone, but after a year, it stopped working.  I was put on a drug called Danazol that filled me with androgens, (male hormones).  This completely eliminated pain and bleeding, but it made me crazy.  I was only on it for a couple months before I had to stop.  It made me violent and depressed.  I was put back on progesterone, along with some strong narcotics for the pain.  I was loopy all the time, which didn't always work well in an office setting.  </p>
<p>In the meantime, I was putting on more weight and having to buy bigger clothes.  I was NOT happy.  </p>
<p>In 2009 I moved to Des Moines and found a doctor that was willing to perform a hysterectomy to end my suffering and potential pain killer addiction.  I had the surgery December 4th, and I've never regretted a thing....</p>
<p>Except....</p>
<p>I was 27 when I had my full hysterectomy and was thrown into full blown menopause.  I started an HRT regimen, but because endometriosis is fed by estrogen, and likely caused by excessive estrogen, I couldn't have much in the way of hormones.  Hot flashes, mood swings, night sweats, insomnia... all of these I could have dealt with, but my body seemed to think rapidly gaining weight should be added to the pile of symptoms.  </p>
<p>I was determined to get myself back down to 170, since after starting hormones and going through the surgery I ballooned up to 210.  I joined a gym and started working out for 2 to 3 hours every night after work, doing cardio and weight training.  This started to burn me out, so I cut down to 45 minutes, 3 days a week.  I was still seeing weight creeping on, so I took more drastic measures and joined Farrell's XTreme Body Shaping.  The classes were fantastic and really challenging.  I thought for sure this would be the key to getting my weight down, but at week 5 I was the only person in the class that had gained 20 pounds.  I was baffled.  I was following the diet, doing the routine... what else was I supposed to do??  Well, I wanted to keep going and finish strong, but I rolled my ankle pretty severely during week 6.  It was over for me after that.  I tried to tape it and go back to class after a week, but it was much too painful.  I was interested in the maintenance classes, but they were too expensive for me. </p>
<p>I went to see my doctor about my ankle and she scolded me for doing such vigorous activity.  She said I should avoid high impact stuff since low estrogen weakens your joints, and my estrogen was in such short supply.  </p>
<p>I switched to walking a couple miles several times a week and got a BodyBugg system and a pen and notepad so I could track what I was burning and what I was eating.  I kept my doctor in the loop since I was kind of interested in having a lap band put in.  I followed the BodyBugg program religiously for several months, but ended up gaining more weight.  I was around 280 at this point.  </p>
<p>Being that heavy was making exercise difficult.  I tried yoga, but couldn't do the moves because my belly and breasts were in the way.  I tried to keep walking, but my bad ankle always hurt and my knees hurt from the weight.  My bra size had grown from a 38 D to a 46 G.  I opted to try water exercise at the Y.  I've gotta admit, it's my favorite work out.  I can have hot flashes until my hypothalamus is content, but I stay cool as a cucumber.  My joints don't hurt, and no one can see how much you're jiggling when you're underwater.  </p>
<p>So, right now, at this very moment, I weigh about 330 lbs, and it makes me sick.  All of my efforts seem to have been in vain.  I hate myself.  I hate the way I look.  I don't want to go out in public.  I don't want people to see me and jump to conclusions about why I'm so heavy.  I don't like worrying about whether I'm going fit in the seats at the symphony, or at a restaurant, etc.  I don't want to be intimate with my boyfriend.  </p>
<p>My doctor says I'm in hormone Hades and has suggested I have gastric bypass.  Her theory is, my body was producing excess estrogen, causing the endometriosis.  Surgical menopause completely shut down my estrogen production, and I'm getting back very little with HRT.  The only other source of estrogen is from body tissues, i.e., fat.  So my body stockpiles fat in order to produce more estrogen.  I'm willing to do what it takes and have gone through the classes at Mercy Bariatric Center.  I meet all the requirements for the surgery, but my insurance company turned me down.  The bariatric center appealed their decision but they still denied it.  The nurses I spoke to said the decision was very fishy and that they seemed to be giving me the run around.  I'll be switching insurance companies soon, but the process of waiting is making me crazy.  </p>
<p>I feel like I'm watching sand slipping through an hour glass.  Since putting on this weight I've struggled to keep my cholesterol and triglycerides down, I've developed sleep apnea, my hot flashes have tripled in intensity, and I'm terrified I'll become diabetic or have a heart attack at the age of 30.  Heredity is not on my side here.  As I mentioned before, my father passed away last August from sudden cardiac death.  Heart disease and diabetes are rampant in my family.  </p>
<p>I just want to be healthy.  I don't want to be a shut in.  I want to exercise knowing that it's actually benefitting my body, not making my hips and knees fall apart.  I want to feel sexy.  I want to go out in public with my boyfriend and not feel like everyone is staring at him because he's with some fat chick.  I want to be able to shop at the mall again, and not special fat girl stores.  I want to feel like I have a future.  </p>
<h3>I'm asking for $30,000 to fund gastric bypass surgery; the procedure, anesthesia, and hospital stay.  I'm asking for my life back.  All of the funds received will go to Mercy Bariatric Center in Des Moines to pay for the procedure.  If I don't meet my goal, the funds will be used in a couple of ways.  Paying insurance premiums for a new provider, and a program called Optifast, a prepackaged meal program that is monitored by a hospital nutritionist.  Hopefully this would make me more appealing to my insurance company.   (<a href=""http://www.mercydesmoines.org/weightreduction/serv_weight_optifast.cfm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.mercydesmoines.org/weightreduction/serv_weight_optifast.cfm</a>)</h3>

</div></div>","Hello All.  My name is Tiffini.  I'm originally from Grinnell, Iowa, but have been living in Des Moines, Iowa for about 3 years now. I'm currently a student of mortuary science at Des Moines Area Community College with an anticipated graduation date of May 2014.  Being in this profession is something I've always wanted to do, but didn't have the guts for until I was laid off from my job on December 31, 2010.  And if I was having any doubts about this profession, those were squashed when my father passed away at the age of 57 from sudden cardiac death on August 3rd, 2011. The funeral home that handled his final wishes was comforting and competent, and I want to be able to provide that service to others that are grieving.  
This campaign has the potential to give me my life back.  
Way back when, when I was just 12 years old, a little friend visited me.  The same friend that visits all girls that age.  My... *shhhhh*... period.  I'll try to keep the graphic details to a minimum, but make no promises.  
It wasn't anything like those little films they show to kids.  There was no celebration, no hugs from family and friends because I'd ""become a woman."" BAH.  There was just tooth grinding pain.  For several years I just dealt with it, occassionally complaining to my mom about how much it hurt.  Sometimes, if I couldn't stop crying and screaming from the hurt, she'd let me stay home from school.  
When I reached high school I talked to my doctor about my situation and she gave me birth control pills.  This helped take the edge off, but I still cringed with fear every 28 days and still had to miss class occassionally.  When I entered college in 2000, I was put on a different kind of birth control pill.  This one did a slightly better job at keeping the pain and bleeding under control.  Throughout college I was plagued by lady issues of a yeasty and bacterial nature.  
Out of college, things started to get more serious, pain and bleeding wise.  I asked a gynecologist if I could have a laparoscopy done to check for anything abnormal, but was told my symptoms didn't really warrant the surgery.  I saw about 5 more doctors after that.  One told me I was fine.  Another told me it was in my head.  Another ordered a transvaginal ultrasound.  When I asked for the results, I was told everything was fine and led out of the room.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>On August 28, 2012, 27 year old Sonali Mukherjee began one of many surgeries (involving eye operations and hair and ear transplants) to help reconstruct her face. It melted 9 years ago, after 3 men poured acid on her while she slept. This was in response to her fending off their relentless sexual advances as she made her way to school every morning. In india this type of harassment that women face is called 'eve teasing.'</p>
<p>Before it all happened, Sonali was studying sociology, she was a happy 17-year old. She no longer studies sociology, nor does she retain much happiness. But she's still got her spirit and a strong desire to pursue her education. Sonali has now petitioned her government to either help her find justice or give her the right to die. </p>
<p>For six of the last nine years, her assailants have been walking the streets. Sonali and her family, bankrupted paying for her care, had to move villages after they were threatened by the men when they returned. She has persistently appealed to the Indian justice system for medical assistance and stricter penalties for assailants, and a fund has been created to cover the expense of her medical care.</p>
<p>She isn't alone, however. In Columbia  there were at least 150 acid-throwing incidents last year, women like 51-year old Consuela Cordoba wear masks every day of their lives. In England, Katie Piper (a model) was doused in acid after a rejected ex-boyfriend hired someone to attack her. In Afganistan, schoolgirls are habitually subjected to acid throwing. In Pakistan, 10-year old Zaib Aslam thought someone had lit her face on fire when men on motorcycles threw acid on her face as she waited with her mother at a bus stop. In Rome last year, after 38 grueling surgeries, 33-year old Fakhra Youan finally committed suicide, 10 years after she was assaulted in this way. Only a few of countless incidents mentioned here.</p>
<p>The state of India, in collusion with Sonali's assailants, has stood by and allowed multiple injustices to occur. It has failed to protect Sonali and other women like her and to adequately protect their rights under the law.</p>
<p>There are sections of the law that make gestures or acts intended to insult the modesty of a woman or acts intrude upon her privacy a crime. The provisions under these sections and the procedural laws are complex and the type of proof that is required make it very difficult to get assailants punished.</p>
<p>Section 509- Whoever, intending to insult the modesty of any woman, utters any word makes any sound or gesture, or exhibits any object, intending that such word or sound shall be heard, or that such gesture or object shall be seen, by such woman, or intrudes upon the privacy of such woman, shall be punished with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine, or with both.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Currently Sonali is scheduled for numerous surgeries to get her back on her feet - the one we are raising funds for is- Release of burn contracture, local soft tissue rearrangement and skin grafting to allow neck mobility. It requires approx. $10,000 USD. The money raised will be remitted to her father who currently handles all her affairs.</p>

<h1>My Story</h1>
</div><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">I deployed in February of 2011 to Kunduz Provence, Afghanistan. I experienced my traumatic event around July of 2011. I noticed after that event that my sleep was greatly disturbed, I was having constant dreams of drowning in blood. But I sucked it up and didn't let it interfere with my job . I redeployed back to Germany in January 2012. I noticed my sleeping was off but I believed it was just my body adjusting to the time zone. I didn't notice the effect of the PTSD until I PCSD to Fort Riley, Kansas in September of 2012. I noticed my depression, self worth, attitude, and just everything that made me happy was in a really dark place. I was having flashbacks at training events and just being around other fellow soldiers. There were time were I would have full blown panic attack by just putting on my physical training uniform, to the point where I would vomit, get light headed and have to sit down because of the dizziness. I would sometimes lock myself in my closet and breakdown because all I could see was death when I closed my eyes.That is when I attended a Tempered Steel brief and just listening to all these soldiers talking about their experiences and being able to relate to them helped me see the problem in me. I seeked help after that.
Everything kept adding up to the point were I attempted suicide for the first time. I was hospitalized for 15 days and was then released. I got hospitalized a second time for attempting suicide, but this time it was because the medication was off and I was still having all the same symptoms. I married my wife on May 25, 2013. I deployed again in June of 2013 to Africa for 6 months. I believed that I had my symptoms under control but in February of 2014 my grandfather passed so I went home on emergency leave and helped finance and coordinate for the funeral. My depression was bad but I came back and went to a month long training event in Fort Polk, LA. About 5 days into it and battling with all my symptoms coming back, I blacked out and ended up cutting myself. This lead to my third 15 day hospitalization in Louisiana. I came back to Fort Riley after that and got sent to a month long intense PTSD treatment program in Kansas City, Missouri.
That is where I learned that art helped me bring back a piece of me. I noticed a great improvement in my attitude. I was able to create and get my frustrations out with woodwork. My wife noticed it too and supported with anything that I needed. Now I'm in the process of getting Medboarded for my conditions. I am trying to save as much money as I can so I can ease the transition for my wife and myself but that means that I don't have money left to buy tools and materials to keep my woodwork going. </span></p><h2>Extended Story</h2><div>

<h3>You Decide What We Research</h3>
</div>
<div>As patients we have a lot of theories that have never been properly tested.

</div>

<div>We are the first community focused on finding evidence-based answers to the questions patients are asking right now. That's because Flaredown learns specifically about the things patients <i>choose</i> to track.</div>

We can still use your support! Currently we pay for server and development costs out-of-pocket. Every donation helps.

Below is the original IndieGoGo campaign. With your feedback, the app has improved since this pitch.
--------------------------------------

Flaredown is a website and mobile app that makes it easy to visualize your health and your treatments. It's also the first community of patients gathering research-backed data to establish how well treatments work in the real world, and uncover the best new ones.


Flaredown is built by patients, for patients. It will be free, forever.







How It Works
It couldn't be more simple: each day you log in to Flaredown it will ask you a few questions about your illness. That's it! It takes about 30 seconds.










The questions you see are specific to your illness and come from formulas that medical researchers use right now to rate the severity of a patient's condition. Flaredown will take your answers, crunch the numbers, and graph your illness activity over time.












Now when you wonder what's causing you to feel bad you can go back through a complete, visual history of your illness and see clearly what triggered your symptoms, and how well your treatments are really working.

Every patient is different so we don't limit the treatments you can track. Medication or natural remedy, you just give it a name and Flaredown will start recording it.






Since you have all this cool data, Flaredown can print it out in a format that's ready to show to your doctor. The average appointment lasts about 15 minutes and they have to make decisions that will affect your health for months, a detailed history printout helps give them all the info they need to make the best choices with you.









Flaredown learns from the data it gets and shares that knowledge with you in the Insights section. You'll see all the treatments and triggers patients are tracking right now, and stats showing how Flaredown users have responded to them. 









Each treatment/trigger page has a discussion section where you can talk directly with other patients about their experience with the topic, because there's more to managing chronic illness than statistics alone can show.




You Decide What We Research

As patients we have a lot of theories that have never been properly tested. You can see it all over the internet--people are taking their questions to social networks and forums everywhere.


We are the first community focused on finding evidence-based answers to the questions patients are asking right now. That's because Flaredown learns specifically about the things patients choose to track.



Are Lupus patients worried about stress? We'll learn exactly how much it affects Lupus disease activity on average. Are Fibromyalgia patients taking low dose naltrexone? We'll tell you how effective it is in the real world. We even plan to bring in researchers for in-depth studies and release reports to you on a special section of the site.


You can opt out your data and use Flaredown solely for tracking, but we hope you'll consider contributing. This is our bid for patient-first research, and we want you to be a part of it.

They suffer a lot from lack of sleep and jet lag issues. It took them weeks to recover, which impacted their normal life as well as their working performance. </p><p>Coincidentally, in this March, we participated in Orange Fab Asia campaign as a guest where we met their Asia Chairman Mr. Wang who is a frequent flyer as well. He suggested us to create a smart lightweight sleep mask without a clumsy measuring device which would be easy to use. One that not only could help to sleep easily and would also adjust the jet lag at an affordable price. He deeply believed this mask could help lots of people. This matched with our primary idea that motivated us to come up with the solution as quickly as possible. </p><p>To develop this ideal sleeping mask, our team not only studied countless online reviews, purchased many top selling sleep masks for studying but also did the prototypes for testing. It took us months of trying to implement the idea from sketch to prototype 1, 2 and 3. Finally, we came up the Nuvi, a simple sleep aid device that is easy to carry and operate and packed features that help you sleep, wake up and adjust your jet lag. </p><p>Additionally, to prove Nuvi is working efficiently, we did the brain wave experiment and tested it in the medical school. The results were very impressive and showed it helps to relax and induces sleepiness by Zen music and binuarial beats. For the jet lag adjustment, we are following the study finds - the flashing blue light exposure could provide a fast and efficient method of preventing jet lags. We believe Nuvi will not only help long distance travelers but also assists more people with getting better sleep and improving their quality of live.</p><h3> </h3><h3> </h3></div>","About this projectNuvi was developed based on extensive brainwave experimentation and research.

See Brain waves picture A. After wearing Nuvi the Easy Sleep program with Zen music starts, which includes binaural beats. After 5 minutes the tester's brain waves quickly drop to low Alpha waves and afterwards change to slow Theta brain waves. See Brain waves picture B. That means Nuvi can highly clear the mind of the tester and help him fully relax and fall asleep easily.

It is not designed to be a diagnostic tool, form of therapy, or clinical intervention of any kind. Consult your doctor for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of any medical issues. Our TeamWe are a small team full of enthusiasm for sharing our work and providing our backers, friends, and clients with a healthy life style.Story  A lot of my ex-colleagues and friends are frequent flyers. They suffer a lot from lack of sleep and jet lag issues. It took them weeks to recover, which impacted their normal life as well as their working performance. Coincidentally, in this March, we participated in Orange Fab Asia campaign as a guest where we met their Asia Chairman Mr. Wang who is a frequent flyer as well. He suggested us to create a smart lightweight sleep mask without a clumsy measuring device which would be easy to use. One that not only could help to sleep easily and would also adjust the jet lag at an affordable price. He deeply believed this mask could help lots of people. This matched with our primary idea that motivated us to come up with the solution as quickly as possible. To develop this ideal sleeping mask, our team not only studied countless online reviews, purchased many top selling sleep masks for studying but also did the prototypes for testing. It took us months of trying to implement the idea from sketch to prototype 1, 2 and 3. Finally, we came up the Nuvi, a simple sleep aid device that is easy to carry and operate and packed features that help you sleep, wake up and adjust your jet lag. Additionally, to prove Nuvi is working efficiently, we did the brain wave experiment and tested it in the medical school. The results were very impressive and showed it helps to relax and induces sleepiness by Zen music and binuarial beats. For the jet lag adjustment, we are following the study finds - the flashing blue light exposure could provide a fast and efficient method of preventing jet lags. We believe Nuvi will not only help long distance travelers but also assists more people with getting better sleep and improving their quality of live.",35.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>The donation will be for the cost of the RV. This RV, which will be designed with a #campingforthecure tagline, will be used for years to come for cancer patients who wish to take the same trip, despite financial difficulties. The RV can be reserved, for free, for 6 month time periods. </p>

<p>Hi, I'm Jayden. I'm asking for your assistance to help me reach my goal of having top surgery. I'm a 21 year old Trans guy just trying to live my life.</p>
<h2><strong>What is top surgery?</strong></h2>
<p>Top surgery is a fancy name for having a double mastectomy with the final goal of creating a masculinzed chest.</p>
<h2><strong>More about me</strong></h2>
<p>I've been through a lot, and have since learned so much about myself. I was kicked out of my home shortly after I turned 18, and was forced to start rebuilding my life. I never had the opportunity to finish high school, but I managed to get my GED, and have since graduated from college. I currently work at the state psychiatric hospital where I work with individuals suffering from severe mental illnesses. In addition, I also volunteer at a local thrift store whose profits benefit homeless individuals and families.</p>
<p>I don't make a lot of money, but my passion is to help other people. I want to continue on my journey, and I know that I will be able to help more people the more comfortable I am with myself.</p>
<p>Surgery itself is a big and scary thing. However, I know that living in a body that doesn’t match the person that I identify as is an even bigger and scarier thing. It’s tough living in a body that doesn’t reflect me, and I’m asking for your assistance to help correct that</p>

am a man of 54 years old, a former biotechnologist, that turned later to web

and not only for the elite. The idea behind this project is that aging of the
human body is not considered a disease, but a normal process, has always been
so, the way of the world, so since there is no disease there cannot be patents
for cures, so the FDA says. But since there are now scientific insights for
potential cures against the aging process, I want to lobby so that people think:
OK there is a cure! So there must also be a disease (aging) pestering mankind!
Lets tolerate longevity patented medication for everybody now!</p>
<p>There
must come patents because otherwise no pharmaceutical company is going to do
long term investments in research &amp; development and marketing of longevity

<p>The squat is the king of exercises for a reason. <br/>The legs are the biggest muscles in your body and doing squats raises your testosterone levels drastically.  <br/>These compound movements hit more than one muscle and the more fibers you stress during an exercise the more testosterone will be released into the bloodstream. <br/>Squatting has direct benefits for those calf, leg, and butt muscles that you need to stretch, flex, and tone to tighten and strengthen up your booty. <br/>You not only get toned and beautiful legs but also boost healthy hormone production in the body.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551178455/uit5x3wdgiqpuf6hau8y.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>The knees are not at 90 degrees with your leg. <br/>This could be a result of low mobility/flexibility. Nevertheless, this is the number one cause of knee injury.  <br/>Additionally, the squat requires exceptional form, style and technique—learned through years of experience. <br/>The Wonder Squat helps you maintain good form when you are squatting so that your knees stay healthy, and your legs strong.</p>

<p>Strong legs, strong life.  If you want strong legs, you need to Squat.  <br/>But, Research reveals that 86% people don’t know how to Squat correctly. <br/>Squats are also known to cause injuries with the number 1 reason being—bad form. <br/>Additionally, 60% of beginners do not have the strength to Squat.  <br/>In order to help people squat correctly without any injuries while keeping all the benefits—we created the Wonder Squat. </p>

<h3>Twice Effective:</h3>
<p>Our patented Resistance makes you sit slowly, but provides the force necessary for the push to stand up. This feature is great for beginners, who need leg strength.</p>
<h3>No injuries</h3>
<p>The patented Wonder Squat design always keeps your feet at 90 degrees with your legs. This means that you can maintain good form, strengthen your legs and reach your fitness goals with a lower risk of  injuries. </p>

<h2>
<br/>What makes the Wonder Squat so effective?</h2>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Patent Resistance design</h3>
<p>We all know that free-weights are great and can cause a lot of joint pain. Resistance bands are known to produce progressive resistance, which means that your muscles are not completely activated throughout the movement.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551177247/pjkif0uc8bzhzi6uezfz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Wonder Squat works with gravity and your bodyweight.<br/>You can easily do a light cardio workout with just one single exercise. <br/>Additionally, you can also use the Wonder Squat for a wider range of functional exercises like pushups and dips. The Wonder Squat only weighs (please add weight)</p>
<p>The Wonder Squat makes squatting easier for people whose legs are not strong enough. <br/>The spring does that job and was designed to add that little support at the bottom of the squat—helping you keeping you injury free while giving you those toned legs.</p>
<p>Whether you are a beginner or an athlete, someone who wants toned sexy legs, great Buns and Thighs, or for you guys who want to improve the strength and size of your muscles, and also help enhance your core strength and balance, as well as improve flexibility.. Wonder Squat is for you!</p>

</div></div>","Wonder Squat is the World's First Smart Squat machine for anyone who likes to squat.


 
Easy Squat 

 
And, It is smart
The App with build in instruction video, 100 days exercise plan, and will record your daily exercises effort. 


 
 
 

The squat is the king of exercises for a reason. The legs are the biggest muscles in your body and doing squats raises your testosterone levels drastically.  These compound movements hit more than one muscle and the more fibers you stress during an exercise the more testosterone will be released into the bloodstream. Squatting has direct benefits for those calf, leg, and butt muscles that you need to stretch, flex, and tone to tighten and strengthen up your booty. You not only get toned and beautiful legs but also boost healthy hormone production in the body.


The knees are not at 90 degrees with your leg. This could be a result of low mobility/flexibility. Nevertheless, this is the number one cause of knee injury.  Additionally, the squat requires exceptional form, style and technique—learned through years of experience. The Wonder Squat helps you maintain good form when you are squatting so that your knees stay healthy, and your legs strong.
 

 
 

Strong legs, strong life.  If you want strong legs, you need to Squat.  But, Research reveals that 86% people don’t know how to Squat correctly. Squats are also known to cause injuries with the number 1 reason being—bad form. Additionally, 60% of beginners do not have the strength to Squat.  In order to help people squat correctly without any injuries while keeping all the benefits—we created the Wonder Squat. 

 
 
 

Twice Effective:
Our patented Resistance makes you sit slowly, but provides the force necessary for the push to stand up. This feature is great for beginners, who need leg strength.
No injuries
The patented Wonder Squat design always keeps your feet at 90 degrees with your legs. This means that you can maintain good form, strengthen your legs and reach your fitness goals with a lower risk of  injuries. 
 


What makes the Wonder Squat so effective?
 
Patent Resistance design
We all know that free-weights are great and can cause a lot of joint pain. Resistance bands are known to produce progressive resistance, which means that your muscles are not completely activated throughout the movement.

Wonder Squat works with gravity and your bodyweight.You can easily do a light cardio workout with just one single exercise. Additionally, you can also use the Wonder Squat for a wider range of functional exercises like pushups and dips. The Wonder Squat only weighs (please add weight)
The Wonder Squat makes squatting easier for people whose legs are not strong enough. The spring does that job and was designed to add that little support at the bottom of the squat—helping you keeping you injury free while giving you those toned legs.
Whether you are a beginner or an athlete, someone who wants toned sexy legs, great Buns and Thighs, or for you guys who want to improve the strength and size of your muscles, and also help enhance your core strength and balance, as well as improve flexibility.. Wonder Squat is for you!

<p>The Excellence Training Academy is an online program that provides emotional, psychological, physical, nutritional wellness, and success training and guidance.</p>
<p>We are currently focusing on the development of Live Longer, Live Healthier, an innovative disease fighting wellness program. Its purpose will be to reduce stress, defeat negative mind-states, and increase vitality, therefore boosting the immune system. The program is from the culmination of over 40 years of experimentation, and practical application, and will be based on a field of medicine known as psychoneuroimmunology, and the ETA team’s Dr. Al Barrios (Psychologist, and winner of the first annual National Cancer Federation’s Award in Psychoneuroimmunology) will be speerheading this particular program. And in honor of the significant impact Dr. Barrios has made working with cancer patients, we would like to donate part of the funds we raise here directly to Cancer Research.</p>
<p>We are asking for your help to boost the creation of Live Longer, Live Healthier, &amp; ETA Online Program, Turning our digital library of material into books, workbooks, dvd’s, cd’s, and a magazine, allowing us to reach out to more people, and in continuing to create great programs like this one.</p>
<h2><strong>The Live Longer, Live Healthier Program</strong></h2>
<p>Studies in psychoneuroimmunology have shown that depression and chronic stress increase the risk of the initiation or progression of many serious diseases, in fact it is the basic cause of 60% of all human illness. And 77% of Americans regularly experience physical symptoms of stress.</p>
<p>Chronic stress can lead to premature aging, skin problems, physical pain, infertility, high blood pressure, shorter life span, and susceptibility to infection of any number of diseases. This program will be designed to help us all combat and prevent the negative effects of stress, using visualization, meditation, fitness exercises, and positive psychology.</p>
<p>Here is the basic premise:</p>
<p>The body has a natural defense against disease- the immune system. Negative states of mind (anger, resentment, hopelessness) can suppress the immune system (i.e. stress hormone corticosteroid lowers lymphocyte white blood cells). If you remove these negative mind states the immune system will revive, and reject the disease more easily.</p>
<p>And no, we’re not simply talking about “Imagining your cancer away”, nor are we implying in any way that all people get diseases because they “think wrong”. This is not a miracle cure we are claiming here, we’re talking about naturally boosting the immune system- making your body better able to fight all diseases.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> When suffering from serious illness and disease this program should be used in combination with treatment recommended by your Doctor, not in replacement of.</p>

The Excellence Training Academy is an online program that provides emotional, psychological, physical, nutritional wellness, and success training and guidance.
We are currently focusing on the development of Live Longer, Live Healthier, an innovative disease fighting wellness program. Its purpose will be to reduce stress, defeat negative mind-states, and increase vitality, therefore boosting the immune system. The program is from the culmination of over 40 years of experimentation, and practical application, and will be based on a field of medicine known as psychoneuroimmunology, and the ETA team’s Dr. Al Barrios (Psychologist, and winner of the first annual National Cancer Federation’s Award in Psychoneuroimmunology) will be speerheading this particular program. And in honor of the significant impact Dr. Barrios has made working with cancer patients, we would like to donate part of the funds we raise here directly to Cancer Research.
We are asking for your help to boost the creation of Live Longer, Live Healthier, & ETA Online Program, Turning our digital library of material into books, workbooks, dvd’s, cd’s, and a magazine, allowing us to reach out to more people, and in continuing to create great programs like this one.
The Live Longer, Live Healthier Program
Studies in psychoneuroimmunology have shown that depression and chronic stress increase the risk of the initiation or progression of many serious diseases, in fact it is the basic cause of 60% of all human illness. And 77% of Americans regularly experience physical symptoms of stress.
Chronic stress can lead to premature aging, skin problems, physical pain, infertility, high blood pressure, shorter life span, and susceptibility to infection of any number of diseases. This program will be designed to help us all combat and prevent the negative effects of stress, using visualization, meditation, fitness exercises, and positive psychology.
Here is the basic premise:
The body has a natural defense against disease- the immune system. Negative states of mind (anger, resentment, hopelessness) can suppress the immune system (i.e. stress hormone corticosteroid lowers lymphocyte white blood cells). If you remove these negative mind states the immune system will revive, and reject the disease more easily.
And no, we’re not simply talking about “Imagining your cancer away”, nor are we implying in any way that all people get diseases because they “think wrong”. This is not a miracle cure we are claiming here, we’re talking about naturally boosting the immune system- making your body better able to fight all diseases.
NOTE: When suffering from serious illness and disease this program should be used in combination with treatment recommended by your Doctor, not in replacement of.
Psychoneuroimmunology is a well respected science with a rich history. For more information and recent news Click Here

<h3>The Impact</h3>
The problem with the U.S. health care system is best described by two world-renowned economists, Rosemary Gibson and Janardan Prasad Singh:
<p>“<em>The intrinstic value of healing, rooted in science and ethics, has been forsaken. In its place, the momentary glee of a rising stock price or a giant royalty payment has forever changed what was once a mission. It became a business. Now it is a racket. This is the corruption of a human enterprise that should be the noblest of them all, and it lies at the heart of where American-style health care went wrong.</em>” Source: <a href=""http://www.battleoverhealthcare.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.battleoverhealthcare.org</a>.</p>
<p>At Solarte Health we are on a mission to take back the health care system in the United States--and lower costs. Consumers control virtually every other sector of the U.S. economy. Health care is the <em>only</em> industry in which giant, powerful companies have managed to convince consumers they have no power. But the truth is consumers <em>do</em> have a powerful voice in the health care conversation, and we’re about to amplify it.</p>
<p>Solarte Health is creating an <strong><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">authentically</span></em></strong> “<em>consumer driven</em>” marketplace, one in which consumers have freedom to choose both their health care providers and the cost of the health care services and products they purchase. We’re developing apps for their cell phones and digital technology  that will allow them to shop for the best values. For instance, when faced with the option of paying $4,600 for a colonoscopy vs. $800 for the exact same test at a different location, consumers will have the freedom to purchase the best value—saving both themselves and their employers money. This competition will drive costs down throughout the system—providing substantial savings for both employers and consumers-- for years to come.</p>
<p>Many other start-ups in the healthcare space use words that <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">sound</span></em> like they will bring costs down, but in reality most of these services only add to the cost by making people (and companies) think they need unnecessary services, such as reporting.</p>
<p>Ours is the only company in the healthcare space that is <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">fundamentally going to change the way consumers purchase health care</span></strong> in the United States. We project substantial savings for both employers and employees from day one of implementation. But we need your help to get there.</p>
<p>You and I, and the rest of the U.S., can solve the problem of out-of-control health care spending together. Thank you for joining us in taking on the giants by donating generously to this cause.</p>

When I was 12 years old, my life was radically changed by a single bite of a tick. Thousands of people every year become infected with the B<em>orrelia Burgdorferi</em> bacteria, better known as Lyme disease. Many people are lucky and the disease is detected in its early stages, where it can be treated effectively. Others are not so lucky, living with the bacteria in their bodies for months, even years before a symptom appears.</p>
<p class=""normal"">The illnesses and conditions I developed from the bacteria affect my everyday life and are often debilitating. Over the years, doctors have diagnosed me with everything from Lyme arthritis, fibromyalgia, neurological symptoms such as “brain fog” but worst of all, excessive daytime sleepiness, chronic fatigue syndrome and narcolepsy. Within the past few months, it was discovered that a second tick bit me, infecting me not only with Lyme disease but also Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, another tick-borne illness. I’ve lost count of how many antibiotics, medications and therapies I have tried over the years, all of which have been largely unsuccessful. With my father on permanent disability and my mother working two jobs, the cost of medical expenses has had a significant impact on our family. I began to lose hope of ever being able to live a somewhat “normal”, healthier life but deep down inside, I knew I was not ready to end the fight.</p>
<p class=""normal"">Recently, I learned about a treatment called “whole body hyperthermia”. The treatment is not offered anywhere in North America but is performed in Germany for patients fighting Lyme disease. This is not just another treatment, another antibiotic I would take and hope that it works. This treatment kills the bacteria causing Lyme plus co-infections a tick can transmit, significantly improving a patient’s physical, mental, and emotional well-being each and everyday. Most significantly, it’s effective in 100% of patients -- even in those who have tried everything and have had Lyme disease for years. I now have a once-in-a-lifetime chance to become healthier by receiving an advanced, state of the art treatment in Germany. For me, the outcome to be gained significantly outweighs the potential side effects.</p>
<p class=""normal"">The only obstacle that stands between me and my health is raising the money I need for the treatment. Your donation will go towards the $40K I need to travel to Germany to undergo whole body hyperthermia. This will cover the treatment itself (which costs about €1,000 EUR/$1,300 USD per day) for three weeks, medications &amp; supplements, and traveling expenses. Whether or not my goal is reached, any and all funds will go towards the treatment I need to get better. Along the way, you can follow me through my journey by reading my blog, <strong><a href=""http://www.fightlyme.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.fightlyme.org</a></strong>, to living a healthier life before, during and after my treatment.</p>
<p class=""normal"">My goal from this treatment is not only to be Lyme-free but to be able to share my story. While my story has been extremely personal and difficult to talk about, there are thousands of other people who have their own story and millions more are at risk. It is essential to bring attention to the need of educating the public about this growing epidemic. Spreading awareness by publicizing my story, I feel, is the greatest contribution I can give. Helping others, I believe can be some of the best medicine.</p>
<p class=""normal"">While Lyme disease I feel has impacted my life negatively, I try to look at the positives that have come from fighting a chronic illness. Through hospitalizations, surgeries and treatments, I graduated from Syracuse University with my B.S. in Public Health, teaching me about the tools and resources that have been successful in being an advocate for my health. More importantly, I followed my passion in learning how to help educate the public about many illnesses, not only Lyme disease. However, if I can prevent any individual from going through what I’ve gone through, would make the struggle of getting through school that much more worth it. </p></span></div>","My name is Stacie Van Brandenburg and I am 23 years old.

of the public health sector and personal hygiene and this is something I'm
passionate about changing. I spent last January in
Ondangwa, Namibia researching dental care awareness/access. In my spare time, I
taught children about the importance of dental care at a local center for
orphans and vulnerable children. From my research, there was an evident
correlation between educational background, income, and dental awareness. <a href=""http://new.oberlin.edu/home/news-media/detail.dot?id=5119448"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Click here to read more about my experience!</a></p>
<p>In China, there is approximately
one dentist for every 82,295 people. To compare, in the United States
there are roughly 2,2792 people per dentist. And unfortunately in China,
over 55.3% of people in the 6-19 year age bracket are affected by dental
caries. The aim of my fourth winter term project at Oberlin is to further
research the causation of socioeconomic and geographical factors that affect
people’s dental awareness and care throughout the greater area of Beijing,
China. My research will primarily include interviews with several Chinese
nationals on their experiences and knowledge. Although language barriers limit me to the English speaking
demographic, I still hope to gain insight on others. I also hope to volunteer
with a local program for children informing dental care in some capacity.</p>
<p>While dental health and access is
improving overall, there is still much to be done to prevent and control dental
diseases. My research will aid in my long-term desire to study dental public
health. This experience also paves the way for my aspirations to start a dental
nonprofit, helping people understand the importance of proper dental/oral care
and the implications of improper care. </p>
<p>As of now, the total cost of the
trip comes out to around $1,700 including airfare, food, and other
transportation costs. Not so bad right!? Unfortunately, this project is
currently being funded solely through personal funds. Your financial
support is quintessential to my success and I would be most grateful for any
funds you are able to donate! I understand that not everyone can contribute donations,

<h3>My Goal<br/>
</h3>
<p>After many years of sedentary living and with my 40s fast approaching, I felt like time was slipping away.  I felt old. I felt sorry for myself.  So I started running, loving it, lost 30lbs and now signed up to run my first Triathlon!  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The event is the Malibu Triathlon, which I will be running on September 18th 2011.  My friend Toby signed me up, through his work so I will be running as part of the Paramount team.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The event has a fundraising aspect raising money for the Children's Hospital in Los Angeles and I also wanted to raise money for Lupus, so I thought I would combine them into one Indie-Go-Go campaign.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Please support my goal to raise money for these two worthy causes, and lend me your emotional support too!  I'm pretty comfortable with the running and biking part but everyone says the open water swim is the hardest part! :-)<br/></p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>Over 5 million people around the world are believed to have Lupus.  It strikes predominantly women of child-bearing age (15-44).  Women of color are 2-3 times more vulnerable to the disease.</p>

<h3><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">My Story (tl;dr at the bottom)</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">Hello IndieGoGo, my name is Katherine. I'm 20 years old, and you could say I'm not the average young adult. In my freshman year of high school, I began to suffer from panic attacks and anxiety, two illnesses that severely disrupted my life and have plagued me ever since. Over the years as my anxiety increased and became a more and more daunting aspect of my life, I began to slip in and out of depression. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">The past year and a half has been particularly trying. In the fall of 2010 I went away to college. It was the first time I had ever lived away from home and, although it wasn't all that far from my hometown, I started to feel the depression hovering over me. Things were rough. I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to even complete my first semester, but I pressed on.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">And that's when the sh*t hit the fan. Or, in actuality, that's when the car hit the guardrail. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">In the first week of December my boyfriend and I were driving back to school. Now, I have never been a fan of snow and, unfortunately, being from upstate New York, the majority of my life has been buried under snow. Looking back, I should've known not to go out that Monday morning. It was snowing pretty heavily, but my boyfriend assured me everything would be fine (he <em>had</em> taken Driver's Ed during the winter) and we headed out.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">As we rounded the first corner and the back wheels fishtailed, the tears started streaming. I was ready to give up and hightail it back home. But we kept going. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">Even now as I'm typing this and reliving that morning, my hands are shaking and I am near tears. We successfully made is across the Bay Bridge (the bridge spanning Irondequoit Bay) somehow, but that's when our luck ran out. In an attempt to change lanes, the car hit a patch of ice and we lost control. We spun twice and hit the guardrail, and landed facing oncoming traffic. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">And that's when I lost it. I started screaming and crying at the same time and simply couldn't stop. I'm sure I scared my boyfriend just as much as I scared myself. However strange it sounds, I felt betrayed by the car. I had never been in a car crash before and the feeling of being in an out-of-control vehicle was the worst thing I'd ever felt. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">Thankfully, we weren't hurt besides a bit of whiplash, but I had no idea how badly that crash would effect me. For days afterword, every time I closed my eyes I was back in the car, spinning and crashing. We would later find out that the crash caused me to develop Post Traumatic Stress Disorder or PTSD, which I still have to this day.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">After many calls to our parents and to AAA, a tow truck was able to turn the car around and my dad -- thank goodness for him -- came to pick me up and take me home. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">As you can imagine, this made the last few weeks of the semester almost unbearable. Two rocky weeks passed, and with one week left I could see the end in sight. But on the final Sunday night that I returned to my dorm, I woke up in the middle of the night feeling extremely sick to my stomach. My anxiety immediately went through the roof. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">You see, when my anxiety first started, it came along with an extreme fear of vomiting. To make a long story short, I spent that night sleeping in front of the toilet. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">I honestly don't know how I made it through that last week of school. I refused to eat or drink a single thing the entire week. I figured if I didn't eat anything, I couldn't get sick. And it worked, but unfortunately it would turn into another problem in the long run. I was shaken to my core and I felt so vulnerable. I was scared by how I was acting and how much I was crying.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">Finishing out the semester, I was able to go home and attempt to enjoy the winter holidays. I had it in my head that if I could just make it back home, everything would be alright. Unfortunately, it wasn't. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">Over the last week of school, my stomach had shrunk, my anxiety medication had worn off (I had been too afraid to take my pills), and my panic attacks had returned full force. Christmas day included several panic attacks and constant anxiety. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">As my next semester at school loomed near, my parents and I decided it would be best if I dropped out of school and came home. So we emptied my dorm room and I moved back home. Although I wasn't eating much, things were going okay. Not good, but okay.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">And that's when the sh*t hit the fan again.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">One morning in January I woke up with the worst pain I had EVER felt radiating from my hip. I was suddenly nauseous, extremely warm, sweating, and shaking. I ran to the bathroom, extremely confused and scared about what was going on. I was literally so warm I took off my shirt and was hanging out the window in the cold winter air. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">My mother came home, took one look at me, and rushed me to the emergency room (against my wishes because it was snowing, but I am extremely thankful she made me go). I spent 6 hours in the hospital being poked and prodded as the doctors tried to figure out what was wrong with me. Due to dehydration, I was hooked up to a saline drip and then given an ultrasound. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">As they scanned my insides, I saw confusion flash across the technician's face. He pressed hard beneath my ribs and asked, ""Does this hurt?"" Feeling no pain, I answered that it didn't. Eventually, the doctors came to the conclusion that, because I hadn't been drinking enough water, especially in the last week of school, I had passed a large kidney stone. Because the stone had passed, I was released from the hospital and went home.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">The next day we saw my pediatrician for a follow-up appointment and as he looked over my file he seemed concerned. He told us that during the ultrasound while they were looking at my kidneys, they had also found gallstones. But we were told that since they hadn't caused me any pain so far they most likely wouldn't be a problem. Unfortunately, that information was very, very wrong.      </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">January turned into February and things were okay. I spent most of my time in my room, sleeping. Spending time outside my room made me panicky so I became very isolated. I hated even seeing the snow outside my window, so I kept my curtains drawn. I was extremely depressed when I was awake and I only found comfort in sleeping. Unfortunately it went on like this for a while.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">February turned into March and I was dealt another challenge: I experienced three kidney stones passing over the course of one weekend. I found myself in the ER again, this time being treated by a disbelieving nurse who thought I was only there trying to get narcotics. After a long, painful night, I was allowed to go home.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">I was referred to a nephrologist and blood work was ordered. My calcium levels were slightly elevated and there was a possibility that I might've had a thyroid problem. Thankfully, a test for that came back negative and I was sent home.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">It was around that time that I was referred to a psychologist and I started meeting with her. By the time I started seeing her I had lost a considerable amount of weight due to strange stomach pains I had been experiencing ever since that last week of school. It wasn't that I didn't want to eat, it was that I physically couldn't. Although I explained this concept to the psychologist, she referred me to a local hospital with a teenage-eating-disorder program. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">I went there hoping that someone could explain to me why my stomach was hurting so much and how I could fix it. What I encountered was an extremely degrading environment. As soon as I walked through the door, I was seen as an anorexic teenage girl. No matter how many times I tried to explain to the doctors that I physically couldn't stomach any foods, they still saw me through their tunnel vision.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">Every time I went, I was required to strip naked, put on a hospital gown and get weighed. A male nurse even checked underneath my gown to make sure I wasn't hiding lead weights in my panties.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">There was one certain nurse who I clashed with the worst. We danced around the subject in our conversations, but overall she pretty much called me a liar to my face. She told me that I COULD eat and that I was trying to lose weight on purpose. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">In our final visit, her and another doctor with the same attitude told me to drink a glass of Ensure, which is a drink high in calories they give to patients who can't keep food down. I argued with them, telling them that those drinks made me sick (which they do) and that it would really hurt my stomach. After many tears shed and being told I was lying, I was literally forced to drink the stuff. I left there that day with my mascara running, feeling sick to my stomach, and vowing to never go back there.    </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">It was literally the next weekend that my grandmother passed away. She had been to the doctor and told that she had two types of cancer and might live another six months. She only lasted one. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">That was when I pretty much stopped eating. The pains and nausea my stomach was causing was almost unbearable. For weeks I was only able to eat three Fig Newtons a day. Things were getting serious.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">As quick as possible we went to see a gastroenterologist, who, after meeting with me once and pressing on my belly, knew something was physically wrong. Although something was wrong with me, it was almost a relief. Finally after months of pain and being told it was all in my head, we finally had something to act on. Answers were coming.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">Four days later, I was in the hospital having an endoscopy. The gastroenterologist decided they would look in my stomach to see if I had an ulcer. If it wasn't that, then it was most likely a problem with my gallbladder. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">Sure enough, my stomach was fine. It had been my gallbladder the entire time. The gallbladder I had been told that shouldn't be a problem.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">In June, I met with a surgeon and a week later I was being prepped for surgery. It was one of the most nerve-wracking days of my life. Hospitals have always been a source of stress and I had never needed surgery before. My stomach was completely empty and yet I nearly threw up. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">Recovering from the surgery was possibly even more painful then the kidney stones. But thankfully, the recovery time was quick and suddenly, like some sort of miracle, I could eat again. Not much, but more than three Fig Newtons. After losing 90 -- yes, I said 90 -- pounds, and shrinking 14 pants sizes, the physical maladies had seemed to come to an end.      </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">Unfortunately, the mental illness still remained.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">Over the summer, my boyfriend and I found an apartment close to school so we wouldn't have to commute so far. Things were doing pretty well. We moved all our stuff in, bought our textbooks, and waited for the end of August. Around the same time, I started meeting with a psychiatrist who I was able to connect with much easier. School started and I managed not to pass out on the first day (although I almost did). I was cautious not to jinx it, but things were going rather good. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">Over time though, going back every Sunday night got harder and harder. Every week I grew more homesick, missing my family and the house I'd lived in my entire life. I began to skip classes, not being able to convince myself to go. The stress of catching up was starting to creep up on me and I could tell a mental breakdown was imminent. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">Somehow, I persevered and finished a second semester. I had made it through again. Unfortunately, my grades took a hit because of all the classes I'd missed, but I still passed.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">From the moment I got home for Christmas break, the thought of going back was weighing on my mind. All I wanted was to stay home where I belonged. But I knew if I didn't go back to school I would be letting a lot of people down. For weeks it felt like my brain was trying to rip itself apart. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">So I went back.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">I knew from my first day of classes that this wasn't going to work. I decided to try cutting my work load in half, so I dropped three of my classes. That worked for a little while, but I soon found myself crying at the thought of returning to school. It was an excruciatingly painful decision, but I knew what I had to do.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">So now, here I am again. The story has come full circle. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">I dropped out of school and am still getting help for my anxiety and depression. But I know I need to help myself too.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><strong>HERE'S THE IMPORTANT PART:</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">One thing that has always made me happy from the moment I discovered it is the video game 'Portal' and it's sequel 'Portal 2'. I have always been a gamer, but I have never found a game I loved as much as this one. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">Lately, I have been starving for some creative outlet; something to help ease my anxiety. Ever since I graduated from high school, I haven't taken any art courses and I feel severely burnt out. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">Ever since seeing photos on the web of people redesigning their rooms to be Portal-themed, I've wanted to do the same. I have so many creative ideas my brain is ready to bust. Only thing is, my family has always been low-income and because of my (hopefully) temporary disability, I can't work at this point. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">I think making over my room would be extremely soothing and therapeutic, that's why I'm hoping maybe you guys could help me out :)</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica;"">Doing this project would be such a dream come true! Lately, Portal is the only thing that makes me happy and I really want to expand my creativity. I miss creating art and expressing who I am. I think this will help quell the storm in my mind. </span></p>

</div></div>","My Story (tl;dr at the bottom)
Hello IndieGoGo, my name is Katherine. I'm 20 years old, and you could say I'm not the average young adult. In my freshman year of high school, I began to suffer from panic attacks and anxiety, two illnesses that severely disrupted my life and have plagued me ever since. Over the years as my anxiety increased and became a more and more daunting aspect of my life, I began to slip in and out of depression. 

The past year and a half has been particularly trying. In the fall of 2010 I went away to college. It was the first time I had ever lived away from home and, although it wasn't all that far from my hometown, I started to feel the depression hovering over me. Things were rough. I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to even complete my first semester, but I pressed on.

And that's when the sh*t hit the fan. Or, in actuality, that's when the car hit the guardrail. 

In the first week of December my boyfriend and I were driving back to school. Now, I have never been a fan of snow and, unfortunately, being from upstate New York, the majority of my life has been buried under snow. Looking back, I should've known not to go out that Monday morning. It was snowing pretty heavily, but my boyfriend assured me everything would be fine (he had taken Driver's Ed during the winter) and we headed out.

As we rounded the first corner and the back wheels fishtailed, the tears started streaming. I was ready to give up and hightail it back home. But we kept going. 

Even now as I'm typing this and reliving that morning, my hands are shaking and I am near tears. We successfully made is across the Bay Bridge (the bridge spanning Irondequoit Bay) somehow, but that's when our luck ran out. In an attempt to change lanes, the car hit a patch of ice and we lost control. We spun twice and hit the guardrail, and landed facing oncoming traffic. 

And that's when I lost it. I started screaming and crying at the same time and simply couldn't stop. I'm sure I scared my boyfriend just as much as I scared myself. However strange it sounds, I felt betrayed by the car. I had never been in a car crash before and the feeling of being in an out-of-control vehicle was the worst thing I'd ever felt. 

Thankfully, we weren't hurt besides a bit of whiplash, but I had no idea how badly that crash would effect me. For days afterword, every time I closed my eyes I was back in the car, spinning and crashing. We would later find out that the crash caused me to develop Post Traumatic Stress Disorder or PTSD, which I still have to this day.

After many calls to our parents and to AAA, a tow truck was able to turn the car around and my dad -- thank goodness for him -- came to pick me up and take me home. 

As you can imagine, this made the last few weeks of the semester almost unbearable. Two rocky weeks passed, and with one week left I could see the end in sight. But on the final Sunday night that I returned to my dorm, I woke up in the middle of the night feeling extremely sick to my stomach. My anxiety immediately went through the roof. 

You see, when my anxiety first started, it came along with an extreme fear of vomiting. To make a long story short, I spent that night sleeping in front of the toilet. 

I honestly don't know how I made it through that last week of school. I refused to eat or drink a single thing the entire week. I figured if I didn't eat anything, I couldn't get sick. And it worked, but unfortunately it would turn into another problem in the long run. I was shaken to my core and I felt so vulnerable. I was scared by how I was acting and how much I was crying.

Finishing out the semester, I was able to go home and attempt to enjoy the winter holidays. I had it in my head that if I could just make it back home, everything would be alright. Unfortunately, it wasn't. 

Over the last week of school, my stomach had shrunk, my anxiety medication had worn off (I had been too afraid to take my pills), and my panic attacks had returned full force. Christmas day included several panic attacks and constant anxiety. 

As my next semester at school loomed near, my parents and I decided it would be best if I dropped out of school and came home. So we emptied my dorm room and I moved back home. Although I wasn't eating much, things were going okay. Not good, but okay.

And that's when the sh*t hit the fan again.

One morning in January I woke up with the worst pain I had EVER felt radiating from my hip. I was suddenly nauseous, extremely warm, sweating, and shaking. I ran to the bathroom, extremely confused and scared about what was going on. I was literally so warm I took off my shirt and was hanging out the window in the cold winter air. 

My mother came home, took one look at me, and rushed me to the emergency room (against my wishes because it was snowing, but I am extremely thankful she made me go). I spent 6 hours in the hospital being poked and prodded as the doctors tried to figure out what was wrong with me. Due to dehydration, I was hooked up to a saline drip and then given an ultrasound. 

As they scanned my insides, I saw confusion flash across the technician's face. He pressed hard beneath my ribs and asked, ""Does this hurt?"" Feeling no pain, I answered that it didn't. Eventually, the doctors came to the conclusion that, because I hadn't been drinking enough water, especially in the last week of school, I had passed a large kidney stone. Because the stone had passed, I was released from the hospital and went home.

The next day we saw my pediatrician for a follow-up appointment and as he looked over my file he seemed concerned. He told us that during the ultrasound while they were looking at my kidneys, they had also found gallstones. But we were told that since they hadn't caused me any pain so far they most likely wouldn't be a problem. Unfortunately, that information was very, very wrong.      

January turned into February and things were okay. I spent most of my time in my room, sleeping. Spending time outside my room made me panicky so I became very isolated. I hated even seeing the snow outside my window, so I kept my curtains drawn. I was extremely depressed when I was awake and I only found comfort in sleeping. Unfortunately it went on like this for a while.

February turned into March and I was dealt another challenge: I experienced three kidney stones passing over the course of one weekend. I found myself in the ER again, this time being treated by a disbelieving nurse who thought I was only there trying to get narcotics. After a long, painful night, I was allowed to go home.

I was referred to a nephrologist and blood work was ordered. My calcium levels were slightly elevated and there was a possibility that I might've had a thyroid problem. Thankfully, a test for that came back negative and I was sent home.

It was around that time that I was referred to a psychologist and I started meeting with her. By the time I started seeing her I had lost a considerable amount of weight due to strange stomach pains I had been experiencing ever since that last week of school. It wasn't that I didn't want to eat, it was that I physically couldn't. Although I explained this concept to the psychologist, she referred me to a local hospital with a teenage-eating-disorder program. 

I went there hoping that someone could explain to me why my stomach was hurting so much and how I could fix it. What I encountered was an extremely degrading environment. As soon as I walked through the door, I was seen as an anorexic teenage girl. No matter how many times I tried to explain to the doctors that I physically couldn't stomach any foods, they still saw me through their tunnel vision.

Every time I went, I was required to strip naked, put on a hospital gown and get weighed. A male nurse even checked underneath my gown to make sure I wasn't hiding lead weights in my panties.

There was one certain nurse who I clashed with the worst. We danced around the subject in our conversations, but overall she pretty much called me a liar to my face. She told me that I COULD eat and that I was trying to lose weight on purpose. 

In our final visit, her and another doctor with the same attitude told me to drink a glass of Ensure, which is a drink high in calories they give to patients who can't keep food down. I argued with them, telling them that those drinks made me sick (which they do) and that it would really hurt my stomach. After many tears shed and being told I was lying, I was literally forced to drink the stuff. I left there that day with my mascara running, feeling sick to my stomach, and vowing to never go back there.    

It was literally the next weekend that my grandmother passed away. She had been to the doctor and told that she had two types of cancer and might live another six months. She only lasted one. 

That was when I pretty much stopped eating. The pains and nausea my stomach was causing was almost unbearable. For weeks I was only able to eat three Fig Newtons a day. Things were getting serious.

As quick as possible we went to see a gastroenterologist, who, after meeting with me once and pressing on my belly, knew something was physically wrong. Although something was wrong with me, it was almost a relief. Finally after months of pain and being told it was all in my head, we finally had something to act on. Answers were coming.

Four days later, I was in the hospital having an endoscopy. The gastroenterologist decided they would look in my stomach to see if I had an ulcer. If it wasn't that, then it was most likely a problem with my gallbladder. 

Sure enough, my stomach was fine. It had been my gallbladder the entire time. The gallbladder I had been told that shouldn't be a problem.

In June, I met with a surgeon and a week later I was being prepped for surgery. It was one of the most nerve-wracking days of my life. Hospitals have always been a source of stress and I had never needed surgery before. My stomach was completely empty and yet I nearly threw up. 

Recovering from the surgery was possibly even more painful then the kidney stones. But thankfully, the recovery time was quick and suddenly, like some sort of miracle, I could eat again. Not much, but more than three Fig Newtons. After losing 90 -- yes, I said 90 -- pounds, and shrinking 14 pants sizes, the physical maladies had seemed to come to an end.      

Unfortunately, the mental illness still remained.

Over the summer, my boyfriend and I found an apartment close to school so we wouldn't have to commute so far. Things were doing pretty well. We moved all our stuff in, bought our textbooks, and waited for the end of August. Around the same time, I started meeting with a psychiatrist who I was able to connect with much easier. School started and I managed not to pass out on the first day (although I almost did). I was cautious not to jinx it, but things were going rather good. 

Over time though, going back every Sunday night got harder and harder. Every week I grew more homesick, missing my family and the house I'd lived in my entire life. I began to skip classes, not being able to convince myself to go. The stress of catching up was starting to creep up on me and I could tell a mental breakdown was imminent. 

Somehow, I persevered and finished a second semester. I had made it through again. Unfortunately, my grades took a hit because of all the classes I'd missed, but I still passed.

From the moment I got home for Christmas break, the thought of going back was weighing on my mind. All I wanted was to stay home where I belonged. But I knew if I didn't go back to school I would be letting a lot of people down. For weeks it felt like my brain was trying to rip itself apart. 

So I went back.

I knew from my first day of classes that this wasn't going to work. I decided to try cutting my work load in half, so I dropped three of my classes. That worked for a little while, but I soon found myself crying at the thought of returning to school. It was an excruciatingly painful decision, but I knew what I had to do.  

So now, here I am again. The story has come full circle. 

I dropped out of school and am still getting help for my anxiety and depression. But I know I need to help myself too.

HERE'S THE IMPORTANT PART:
One thing that has always made me happy from the moment I discovered it is the video game 'Portal' and it's sequel 'Portal 2'. I have always been a gamer, but I have never found a game I loved as much as this one. 

Lately, I have been starving for some creative outlet; something to help ease my anxiety. Ever since I graduated from high school, I haven't taken any art courses and I feel severely burnt out. 

Ever since seeing photos on the web of people redesigning their rooms to be Portal-themed, I've wanted to do the same. I have so many creative ideas my brain is ready to bust. Only thing is, my family has always been low-income and because of my (hopefully) temporary disability, I can't work at this point. 

I think making over my room would be extremely soothing and therapeutic, that's why I'm hoping maybe you guys could help me out :)

(tl;dr: I am a girl who's been suffering from anxiety and depression for years now, and I think making my room over to be Portal-themed will be extremely beneficial and therapeutic.)  



The Impact
I've spent a good amount of time dreaming up what I'd like my room to look like, and here's what I've come up with:

[Entry Door Wall]  |  [Inset Shelves Wall]  |  [Double Window Wall]  |  [Closet Door Wall]

And, no, I'm not asking you guys to buy me a Portal gun :) My mom pre-ordered it for me and I'm paying her back with babysitting my sister

Doing this project would be such a dream come true! Lately, Portal is the only thing that makes me happy and I really want to expand my creativity. I miss creating art and expressing who I am. I think this will help quell the storm in my mind. 



What I Need & What You Get
I think for this project I'll need about $2,000. I know its kind of a lot, but I have some really fun ideas :)

Here's a list of some of the things I hope to buy: 
 


- Orange Life Preserver [for Borealis buoy] - $32.50 + cost of paint + lettering
- ""Moon in My Room"" [to replicate the Moon from the end of Portal 2] – $19.54
- Orange LED Rope (10 ft) [For orange glowing mirror] - $18.56

- 15” x 22” Oval Mirror [to make glowing Portal mirror] – $18.60
- Red Circle Bath Rug [to pretend its a Heavy Duty Super Colliding Super Button] - $9.99
- Nightstand decals [for Turret nightstand] - $149.95
- Artograph Tracer Junior 10x Projector [for tracing the murals onto the walls] - ~$50
- Many different color paints - [not sure how much this will cost]    
- Stuff for Test Chamber sign - [I've made something similar to this before, I think it'll cost ~$50]
- Fake plants for foliage - ~$90
- Green thumbtacks [for posing foliage] - $0.69
- Artificial stuffed crow - $17.98
- 6"" Clear PVC Pipe [for cube transport tubes]- ~$100
- 4pk 8"" x 10"" Document Frames [for Cave Johnson awards] - $15.97
- Lumber, PVC pipe, paint, hardware + plexiglass for Portal Gun stand [not sure how much this will cost]
- Orange and Blue paint for gel splatters
- Gray, yellow + misc paints for the walls
- Lumber for Turret box nightstand
- Some sort of lighting for GLaDOS's eye
- Puck lighting kits [for the 'Completion Sign'] - $255
- Touch lights for illuminating Cave Johnson awards
- 6 Replica potatoes [for making PotatOS/GLaDOS] - $18.00
- Portal 2 PotatOS Science kit - $24.99
- 12"" x 12"" Orange plexiglass [for completion sign] - $6.69
- Decals for Test Chamber sign
- Vinyl decals for glowing mirrors 
- 'GLaDOS Emergency Shutdown' print
- Fabric for Aperture waiting room curtains



 

I'm not really sure if I'll be able to do any perks, which kinda stinks :( The only thing I could give you would be my undying thanks, which I would do :)



Other Ways You Can Help

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Tristian's surgery is complete and everything went as expected.  He had a bit of a fever after but it seems to have gone down.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">We know that every penny of this campaign is going to help he and his parents stay in Toronto be comfortable so that the focus can be on Tristian getting better instead of finances.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Thank you to everyone who is supporting Tristian and his parents by contributing, spreading his campaign, and keeping them all in your thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>Tristian's Story</strong></p>
<p>Tristian James had always been a happy little boy.  Smiling, dancing, and bubbling with personality and infectious laughter.  When he began to stop placing weight on his leg and cried out in pain when he was picked up, his family knew something was wrong.  At the first visit to the emergency room the doctors thought it was only an infection.  Then over a week later the final diagnosis came in, the word that stopped his parents hearts.  Cancer.</p>
<p>A malignant tumor was found in his left femur.  Agonizing weeks of waiting and it was identified; Ewings Sarcoma, an extremely rare form of bone cancer nearly unheard of in kids his age.  Two-thirds of his left femur is affected by the tumor.  He has started on chemotherapy to try to stop the aggressive cancer from spreading.  So far luck is on his side.</p>
<p>Tristian still needs surgery to remove the tumor.  A very special operation might even be able to save his leg.  There are no specialists in Saskatchewan able to handle this delicate procedure.</p>
<p><strong>Your Contribution</strong></p>
<p>Your contribution will help cover the costs of travel for his parents.  Tristian's surgery takes place in Toronto and they will be unable to bring him home for at least three weeks after the operation.  Contributions will also ease extra medical expenses like prescriptions and parking and help to balance the loss of one full income in the household as Tristian's mom is always up at the hospital with him.  This will be even more strained when they are both in Toronto and away from home and work.</p>
<p>The financial burdens placed on his family will only increase as his fight goes on. </p>
<p>Any contribution big or small will make a huge difference in this little boy's life.  Even $1.00 is a treasure.</p>
<p>Any funds that are raised over and above what will help these short term goals will be placed in trust for Tristian for any other medical expenses that may arise.  Should this battle with cancer be beaten back quickly any remaining funds will be held in the trust for a college education for Tristian.</p>
<p><strong>Importance</strong></p>
<p>Tristian doesn't even realize that he is battling a life threatening condition and continues to be a beacon of light and happiness for those that are suffering alongside him.  Please contribute your support to this little boy and keep a smile on his face.</p>
<p><strong>Our Heartfelt Thanks</strong></p>
<p>Thank you on behalf of Tristian and all of his family and friends for any contribution you can give, even if it's as simple as raising awareness for this fundraiser or Ewings Sarcoma itself.  We would also like to request that everyone out there take a moment to hug someone they care about, you never know when it might be your last chance.</p>

<p><strong>Kevin's Story and the beginning of Walk It Off</strong></p>
<p>This story is among one of the many that starts as a fun filled day and ends in tragedy. While celebrating a family wedding on the beach in Cuba, February 2009, my cousin Kevin Mills, age 28 at the time, was driven head first into the sand by a wave. Luckily, his new brother-in-law was able to pull him out of the water and to safety. Kevin broke his neck, sustaining a Spinal Cord Injury (SCI), was diagnosed a C4 ASIA A, quadriplegic and had no feeling or movement below the shoulders. Kevin and his wife Heather were both Advanced Care Paramedics in Toronto and now have experienced the medical system as both providers and patients. They have learned through our experiences that you must seek out and strive to provide the best care possible for your loved ones. They found that care at a SCI Recovery Centre in California, called Project Walk. They felt this specialized program should be available to our community and so began the process of building this unique not-for-profit SCI recovery centre, serving all of Ontario and beyond. </p>
<p>**Note:  THE VIDEO ATTACHED SHOWS PEOPLE'S EXPERIENCES AND EXPLAINS WHY THE MONEY IS NEEDED FOR THE FES BIKE.  Please ignore the Aviva plea on the video.  Walk It Off unfortunately did not receive funding via Aviva and thus why I am doing this to help them still try and raise the much needed funds. </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Walk it off is in desperate need of very expensive specialized equipment to assist with their recovery program.  </p>
<p>ALL funds raised through this campaign will go towards this equipment. Every little bit helps. Your funds will assist someone with a spinal cord injury to live their fullest quality of life and maybe even one day a possible recovery. </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>There are 85,556 Canadians living with SCI and 4257 occurrences every year. Though SCIs can affect all ages, eighty-four percent of people who sustain a SCI are under 34 years of age. Because SCIs have such an impact on our youth, we intend to develop a SCI prevention and awareness program designed for our high schools. <br/><br/> Traditional SCI rehabilitation is designed to help people function to the maximum with their disability. Traditionally, very little is asked of the paralyzed nervous system and muscles. Clients at WALK IT OFF will receive training by SCI Recovery Specialists who stimulate the nervous system and perform repetitive, manual manipulation of the paralyzed areas of the body with intense core retraining. This approach is known as the Dardzinski MethodTM of Spinal Cord Injury Recovery developed by Project Walk. This exercise-based recovery program will also assist clients in maintaining muscle mass and bone density to provide the physical foundation for recovery and to coincide with future medical advances. The Walk It Off program will not only benefit the recovery stages of a SCI but help with a client’s lifetime of physical well-being. People with SCIs not only face paralysis; there are also degenerative issues such as osteoporosis, circulatory and urinary tract diseases and physical regression that lead to a lower life expectancy. All of these require limb movement and weight bearing to slow the process and reduce the occurrences of these problems. Our facility will be the first of its kind in Ontario </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Please share this campaign with others and also spread the word about Walk It Off Spinal Cord Recovery and Wellness.  There are many people with an SCI who don’t know about this option for recovery and rehabilitation.</p>

<p>We are a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization committed to fighting childhood obesity.  Body Sculpt has been helping New York school children for more than 20 years through a variety of programs and services and now we need your help to continue our mission.  This campaign will help fund our 10<sup>th</sup> Annual Children’s Sports &amp; Fitness Expo.</p>
<p>The Expo is an annual FREE event where thousands of children have the opportunity to participate in over 25 sports activities, health screenings and nutrition clinics.  Through this event, families gain exposure to activities and services that will help them become physically fit thereby reducing the risk of obesity in their lives.  Some of these activities include: fencing, tennis, soccer, golf, archery, volleyball, capoeira, gymnastics, basketball, baseball and much more.  The sports clinics are conducted by over 35 Certified, Semi-Pro  collegiate athletes.</p>
<p>This year the 10<sup>th</sup> annual Children’s Sports &amp; Fitness Expo will take place on Saturday, June 15, 2013 from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. at the Boys &amp; Girls High School in Brooklyn, N.Y.</p>
<p>As President of <a href=""http://www.bodysculpt.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Body Sculpt of New York</a> and a personal trainer, my mission has always been to help people attain their fitness goals so they can live healthier lives.  The Expo has been the culmination of a dream for me.  We are changing lives, one family at a time and I hope you will see this as an opportunity to help make a difference in a child’s life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">How You Can Help</span></strong></p>
<p>So, what are we going to do with your money?</p>
<p>As you can imagine, putting on an event this size is a HUGE undertaking.  The $10,000 we hope to raise will help us provide 25 sports activities and trainers to more than 5,000 children.  It will also help us to purchase t-shirts and provide breakfast and lunch for the 200 volunteers who are graciously donating their time from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.</p>
<p>Any funds raised above and beyond our goal of $10,000 will go towards offering a Six Weeks to Fitness program for parents and children immediately following the Expo.  You can find out more about our Six Weeks to Fitness program by going to <a href=""http://www.sixweeks.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.sixweeks.com</a>.</p>
<p>Can I count on you to help us meet or surpass our goal and make this the best Expo ever?</p>
<p>We at Body Sculpt of New York believe that if you introduce children to sports activities at a young age, they will find one that they enjoy and will continue into their adult years.  We are changing lives and generations.</p>
<p>As a not-for-profit, this means any donations you make are tax deductible and it also means that you are a wonderful person for caring enough to help.  To show you our gratitude, we’ve included a few perks which include (1) being listed on our website; (2) being listed in a souvenir program book; (3) t-shirts, (4) consultations with our fitness trainers, (5) consultations with our nutritionists (6) a customized meal plan.  Not only are you helping others, but you’re also helping yourself to stay fit and healthy.  Sounds like a win-win situation doesn’t it?  Even if you don’t need the fitness or nutrition services, you may wish to donate and pass on the perks to one of your family members or friends.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The Impact</span></strong></p>
<p>We know you’ve all seen the alarming headlines about the childhood obesity epidemic.  The CDC reports that 18% of adolescents in America are obese and according to the New England Journal of Medicine children today will not live as long as their parents because of obesity.  To me, this is a call to action!</p>
<p>The Expo has a proven track record of being able to serve as an effective intervention that can contribute to behavior modification and increased awareness about the importance of proper nutrition and regular physical activity.  I hope you will help us continue this work.

<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Other Ways You Can Help</span></strong></p>
<p>We totally get it if you can’t make a donation at this time, but there are other ways in which you can help.  You can start by spreading the word! Please tell your friends, co-workers, family, frenemies – anyone you can think of about our campaign.  Put it on blast through your social media networks.</p>
<p>Also, if you’re in the Brooklyn area on Saturday, June 15, 2013 from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., come out and visit us at the Expo.  We will be at Boys &amp; Girls H.S., 1700 Fulton Street, Brooklyn, N.Y. 11213.  With your help and support, we can continue to keep this wonderful event FREE for the community.</p>

<h2>NoDoubt Workout Changes Lives Through Fitness!</h2>
<p>NoDoubt Workout was started in 2004 by Cedric Duplessis Jr NASM/CPT/OPT/CES, to provide personal training sessions and group fitness classes in the New Orleans area.</p>
<p>The NoDoubt Workout group fitness classes are expanding rapidly. As of April 2013,  classes are being held at a new location and participant numbers are growing. NoDoubt Workout is raising funds to purchase aerobic step boards to accomodate the needs of the group fitness classes. </p>
<p>Since Cedric started NoDoubt Workout, there are countless testimonials from clients explaining how his intense motivation and extensive knowledge base has helped to change their lives through successful weight loss. Cedric is passionate about fitness and his clients. Every person that he trains knows how important they are to him because of how he is able to motivate them to achieve their fitness goals, no matter what. Whether you are attending a group fitness class or a personal training session, Cedric makes sure that you will push yourself to get a good workout, NoDoubt!</p>
<p>One of the essential pieces to the group fitness classes is the aerobic step boards. It is imperative that NoDoubt gain the capacity to purchase approximately 30 step boards so that all participants in the NoDoubt group fitness classes have access to the intense workout Cedric offers.</p>
<h3><strong>Let's Be Specific...</strong></h3>
</div>
<p>NoDoubt Workout needs to purchase approximately 30 step boards for group fitness classes. The step boards cost $100 each (not including taxes and shipping), thus a need to raise $3000 to cover the costs of the boards.</p>
<p>If you are able to donate, NoDoubt Workout is offering great perks that include free group fitness classes, NoDoubt Workout T-Shirts, NoDoubt Workout DVD's, and Individual Fitness Profiles.</p>

<p>I'm <a href=""http://stef.io"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Stef</a>, a designer and software developer from London and I'm seeking your help in creating and launching the <a href=""http://datanecklace.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Data Necklace</a> - a set of bespoke, laser-cut necklaces individually made for someone that displays their data in a beautiful way.</p>
<p>Tweets, dates, meaningul words can all be visualised in a unique way to reflect the wearer's personality, history or stories.</p>
<h3>A Necklace that visualises how often you use the word ""love"" on Twitter? (Or a word of your choice...)</h3>
<p><img alt=""The Love necklace for @emilyquinton"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://datanecklace.com/images/necklace-master.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 100%;""/></p>
<p>The ""love"" necklace displays an entire year of tweets by a person. The lengths of the beads indicate the number of tweets in a month. The shorter lengths indicate how often she used the word ""love"" that month. I can do the same for any word.</p>
<p>Along the sides of every other bead you'll see a single laser-etched tweet for that period. They're visible if you hold up the beads to the light, and are partially public, partially private. I like to think of them as little reminders, memories, almost like a 21st Century locket.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/aeioux/8043236784/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""A necklace before it's assembled by Aeioux, on Flickr""><img alt=""A necklace before it's assembled"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8032/8043236784_1d68d5848f_c.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 100%;""/></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""How you read the necklace"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://datanecklace.com/images/pair-explanation.png"" src="""" style=""width: 100%;""/></p>
<p>The design is totally personal - I download the person's tweets, run them through some software that I've writetn, and based on a particular word (""happy"", ""want"", ""amazing"") the result is a laser-cut and laser-etched necklace, hand-assembled with a sterling silver chain. I had to learn how to make jewellery in the process!</p>
<p>This product is just past the ""prototype"" stage and I'm refining the design for a limited run. You'd be helping me do that.</p>
<h3>What I need to make this happen</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>The prototypes you can see on the <a href=""http://datanecklace.com/#gallery"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Data Necklace gallery</a> are all made using a laser-cutter, from a variety of materials. It's expensive experimenting with a laser-cutter! The hourly rate just to be in the room is £50. Then there are the materials - silver is also expensive. So I'm looking for funds to help me experiment and perfect the designs that I'm developing. </p>
<p>If we reach my funding goal then I'd have enough funds to experiment and perfect the following additional designs and begin making them.</p>
<p>If I exceed the goal I could even buy a laser cutter, invest in marketing and design around the product and improve my chances of making this project a success.</p>
<h3>The other designs</h3>
<p>In addition to the Twitter Necklace I have two other designs that I'm developing.</p>

Buzz about this project: Huffington Post, BBC, The Observer, Wall Street Journal, Wired, The Guardian, Domestic Sluttery.

I'm Stef, a designer and software developer from London and I'm seeking your help in creating and launching the Data Necklace - a set of bespoke, laser-cut necklaces individually made for someone that displays their data in a beautiful way.
Tweets, dates, meaningul words can all be visualised in a unique way to reflect the wearer's personality, history or stories.
A Necklace that visualises how often you use the word ""love"" on Twitter? (Or a word of your choice...)

The ""love"" necklace displays an entire year of tweets by a person. The lengths of the beads indicate the number of tweets in a month. The shorter lengths indicate how often she used the word ""love"" that month. I can do the same for any word.
Along the sides of every other bead you'll see a single laser-etched tweet for that period. They're visible if you hold up the beads to the light, and are partially public, partially private. I like to think of them as little reminders, memories, almost like a 21st Century locket.

 

The design is totally personal - I download the person's tweets, run them through some software that I've writetn, and based on a particular word (""happy"", ""want"", ""amazing"") the result is a laser-cut and laser-etched necklace, hand-assembled with a sterling silver chain. I had to learn how to make jewellery in the process!
This product is just past the ""prototype"" stage and I'm refining the design for a limited run. You'd be helping me do that.

If I exceed the goal I could even buy a laser cutter, invest in marketing and design around the product and improve my chances of making this project a success.
The other designs
In addition to the Twitter Necklace I have two other designs that I'm developing.
The Felt Data Necklace


 

 
Inspired by the wool-making and design traditions of the Inner Hebrides, Scotland, this is a visualisation of a person's Twitter activity over the period of a year, rendered as a felt ""collar"" necklace. 73 ellipses, representing 5-day periods of a year are cut from a single piece of coloured felt.

The Text Necklace


A series of pairs of words and numeric values that are rendered as a necklace.
A set of beads matches the values (the larger the number, the longer and more bulbous the bead), and along each bead the text you've supplied is laser-etched.
The results are quite stunning. However, this is the most experimental - I need to develop and perfect the way that people supply the data, and also how I communicate with them about the potential design before it is cut, so that they are happy with it.

<h3>Public Park in a Township</h3>
<p>I am a self employed Landscape Architect trying to do more work for townships (AKA squatter camps) around South Africa. I have been educated in the U.S and Norway, starting my degree at California Polytechnic University in San Luis Obispo and completing my masters at the University of Life Sciences in Norway.</p>
<p>My recent thesis on alternatives to low cost housing for informal settlements sparked my enthusiasm in helping township and squatter camp communities. I want to put more of my time and energy into creating parks and recreational spaces for our people living below the poverty line.</p>
<p>Townships are some of the most densely populated human settlements, many of <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">which have little to no open space for the community to enjoy. During Apartheid these tracts of land were given very little services and zero to very little town planning. Facilities such as toilets, roads, sidewalks or recreational open space (parks) were never even considered. </span></p>
<p>Many of these townships today are so densely populated today (5 x more than New York City!) that kids are forced to recreate along the sides of freeways!</p>
<p>The need for open space is dire!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/134782/files/20131015120939-Master_Thesis_-_Presentation22.jpg?1381864179"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>It's hard for me to see people still living in such conditions. I consider myself fortunate for where I grew up and the ability to go to school in a safe environment. I therefore want to offer the skills I gained from University and help these underprivileged communities and townships. </p>

<p>I've managed to team up with an inspirational Non-profit organization called <i>Etafeni (<a href=""http://www.etafeni.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.etafeni.org</a>)</i> which is based in a township called <i>Nyanga</i>, located on the outskirts of Cape Town. </p>
<p>After meeting with Etafeni's Development Manager, Stephanie Kilroe, and other members from Cape Town Municipality and Nyanga, we have set our aim at developing a park that focuses on uplifting the community and more specifically, the youth! </p>
<p>Typical of many townships, Nyanga is a densely populated area. It has very little open space and very few parks for the residents to recreate in and enjoy. Many of the kids are  then forced to recreate in the roads or along sidewalks!</p>

<br/><p></p>
<p>As of October 16th 2013, The City of Cape Town has recently given Etafeni and myself the go ahead to get working on the land. <i>YES MANN! Our first major step!</i></p>
<p>I have offered to volunteer what I can afford on this project, but what I am hoping for here is funding that allows us to build a park that no township has seen before! We want this park to be the best it can be. We want to give these kids a park they can feel safe in and enjoy! The more help we get, the better the park will be and the better life the kids will have. This may sound far fetched but a better community, helps makes a better town, a better country and finally a better world. A better quality of life for all of us!</p>
<p>We envision this park becoming one of the many gems within Nyanga, having a positive knock on effect that </p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">In order to make this project work we are relying on funding, skilled personal and materials. The administering of the project alone will need an estimated $4,000 (R40, 000) (NOK 25, 000) (€3,000)</span><br/></p>

<p>My name is Cashmere Nicole. Yes, my boobs were broken. Not only were my boobs broken. My entire world came crashing down after learning of my breast cancer diagnosis. After hearing of my diagnosis, the thoughts that went through my mind were: HOW? WHY ME? OMG...OMG...THIS is HUGE. My daughter, my company and everything that I had spent 26 years building was threatened. I thought about planning my own funeral and I even thought about how I'd like my daughter to be raised.</p>
<p>I'm thankful to be here today; alive and well enough to fight back. Just before I was diagnosed, I had begun building my company 'Beauty Bakerie Cosmetics Brand'. It had been my lifelong dream to begin my own company. However, upon my illness all operations were forced to a screeching halt. Marketing stopped. Sales stopped. Everything had to be stopped.</p>
<p>I find a hard time still accepting that a classmate of mine named, Kelly Brooke Anderson passed away from breast cancer the morning I awoke from reconstruction surgery. I reached out to her mother because I felt as though Kelly passed her torch to me. If she were alive, she'd continue trying to make strides in raising awareness.</p>
<p>I understand fully now why I had to endure this tragedy...recreating my brand by merging my passion with my testimony to save lives.</p>
<p>What I need and What You Get...</p>
<p>I hope to raise 25,000. I will use these funds to recreate and rebrand my company: website, repackaging, design, distribution). This also includes promotional and marketing objectives that will include bringing awareness to young women all over through visiting colleges and organizations. I'd like to give makeovers to breast cancer patients to inspire them to continue the fight. Lastly, it's my hope to have a song written along with a music video that will shed light on my experience and the love story that evolved from tragedy.</p>
<p>I have some pretty neat perks based on your level of donation or participation with my campaign, including the opportunity to meet me in person and assist me in making over a patient! If I do not reach my entire goal, I will use whatever funds I have obtained and continue to fight to make this happen!</p>
<p>We all know someone who believes that cancer cannot happen to them because they are young, because they are busy living their dreams or because it just can't. They need a face behind this..

aloha! I'm Levon</b>, and I am the
founder, owner, and lone ranger fitness professional at Superhuman Fitness, a exclusively
mobile fitness training company on the island of Oahu in Hawaii. I span the island on a daily basis to provide lower
cost fitness services to my personal training clients and group fitness  classes at local parks, beaches, and in their
own homes.  I also provide highly
effective and personalized training services to clients worldwide through
follow-along video training programs and 1-on-1 training and consultation video
conferencing sessions.  I also love
learning and spreading my knowledge as much as I can through writing and I
maintain a regularly published free fitness newsletter and have a couple of
different fitness-related books in the works as well.  I LOVE what I do and I see myself and the way
I interact with and influence my people as a breath of down-to-earth fresh air
in a largely shallow, self-centered, look-at-me fitness industrty.  We go against that grain at Superhuman
Fitness with the mantra of “Real. Good. Fitness.” and I will cough up a lung
and then some in my quest to create a “WOW” type of experience and level of
service that my clients won’t find anywhere else, and all at a cost that they
won’t find anywhere else.  This is my #1
goal!  <p></p>
<p><b>I also have another goal and a big dream</b>. I sincerely look at everyone I encounter with thoughts
like, “I wonder if he needs my help” and “what could I do to help her live a
healthier life?”  I’ve never been a “I
want to change the world!” kind of guy (I honestly think that’s the first time
I’ve ever used that cliche), but I guess in a way I kinda do.  <i>My goal
is to help 1000</i><i> <span>people by the end of 2014 successfully reach their
health and fitness goals</span></i>, or at least be well on their way to doing so by making and <span>getting started on a solid plan of action that is
begining to achieve measurable results. 
I really, REALLY want to make this happen!  A lot of plans are in place, some are in
motion, but more help is needed to get the Superhuman Fitness train really
moving to help as many people as possible become more than they ever thought
they could be.</span></p>
<p>But before I share those plans with you and describe
how you can help, <b>here’s a bit of my
story</b>...</p>
<p><b></b></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/248280/files/20131207182620-P8020011.JPG?1386469580"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p><p></p><p><b>In another life in the not too distant past</b>, I was in medical school studying to become a
physician.  I’ve always been physically
active and had a strong interest in the functioning of the human body and so I
wanted to do something that involved these interests.  Also, as an ultra committed and involved
family man (more on that later), my strongest desire was to pursue a career
that would allow me to be involved with my interests and helping people while
providing the kind of income that would allow me to have a traditional home
structure and opportunities for my kids’ growth and eduation.</p>
<p><b>Ultimately, however, this plan didn’t work out</b>.  “Stuff” hit the fan
while in my first year of medical school when I made some heartwrenching
discoveries in my marriage.  Then the fan
came off the ceiling when my wife at the time suddenly and without warning left
our home, taking our two young children with her, and relocated to another
island.  I won’t go into all the details
of all that happened as I don’t feel like the airing of dirty laundry is healthy
or helpful to anyone, but the end result of this sudden upheaval in my personal
life was an inability to stay focused on my studies in medical school.  As a result, my grades plummeted and I was
not allowed to continue in the curriculum, leaving me to bascially start my
adult life over again from scratch! (Except it wasn’t really starting all over
– private medical school education is anything but cheap and I’ve got the
6-figure student loan burden to prove it!)</p>
<p><b>So here
I am now.</b>  Thankfully, my struggles
led me to do a lot of soul searching, if you will, and re-evaluating of my life
and in which direction I would take it next. 
Interestingly, I ended up going full circle in a way by coming back to
doing something I’ve always loved and had a passion for but never really
considered pursuing as a career – fitness.</p>
<p><b>Making
it my own</b> – I’ve been a certified fitness professional for almost 10
years now and involved in high levels of athletic competition and training for
most of my life.  But for most of that
time I’ve never been able to picture myself working in fitness as a full-time
career, mostly because I’ve never been a fan of the typical gym atmosphere and
I most certainly detest the stereotypical nature and perception in general of
the fitness industry mentioned above. 
But somehow, in the the middle of my struggles to find myself and what
the next step in my life was to be, Superhuman Fitness was born and a continual
evolution of doing fitness in a way that reflects me and my down-to-earth,
common sense values has unfolded over the past 4+ years.  It’s exciting to create something that you
feel makes an impact not just in the world but in the life of an individual
human being!  I look forward to doing
this for many years to come!</p>
<p><b>I’m
hitting some roadblocks, however</b>.  The aftermath of medical school student
loans, not to mention a very long and drawn out contested divorce, has left me
in a position of needing to do something really big in life to bring myself out
of a pretty substantial hole while supporting myself and my children
financially, but it has also led to not being able to grow my business in a way
that most entrepreneurs would typically attempt (e.g. applying for a business
loan).  I have fought hard to find and
keep happy every client I’ve ever had the privilege to work with, scrimped and
saved and been very creative in growing my very humble supply of fitness
equipment, and have in general had to do pretty much everything in growing my
business the long, slow and hard way. 
It’s been rewarding, but it’s been a very tough road!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/248283/files/20131207182739-Alternate_Logo_jpeg.jpg?1386469659"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><b>But
this is where you can help</b>. 
The evolution of Superhuman Fitness has led to some really big ideas
that I would like to implement in trying to help as many people as possible
accomplish their fitness goals.  Here is
some of my work, the services I offer, or will soon offer:</p>
<p></p><ul>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Highly personalized group and individual fitness training
services on the island of Oahu.</span></li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Additional online fitness support and training services to help on-island
clients reach their goals.</span>
</li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Online check-in training via Skype and other services to help
remote clients make and excute plans to achieve fitness goals.</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">An online, high-intensity, follow-along video system of exercise
called ‘R:20’ which is focused on fat burning and getting fit in shorter, more
condensed workouts that can be done virtually anywhere.  This also includes an ongoing interactive
component with me as well as an online community made up of other subscribers
to this system, worldwide.</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">An online exercise bank that provides hundreds of exercises and
workout programs and templates for a small monthly subscription fee.</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">An additional workout program (downloadable or via DVD, haven’t
decided yet) that centers around high intensity exercise using no-bounce
medicine balls.</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Electronic books I am in the process of writing centered on
several fitness topics.</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">An idea for a new piece of fitness equipment that I would like
to develop, manufacture and bring to the market (that’s all I can tell you
about it for now!).</span></li>
</ul><p></p>
<p><b>I speak out loudly in behalf of and seek those who don’t have
access</b> to fitness facilities and/or qualified fitness
instruction and help.  Sometimes this
barrier to access is cause by financial reasons, other times it is due to
geography as is the case for some of my target areas on Oahu such as the
Waianae coast and the Ko’olauloa area from Ka’a’awa to Kahuku, as well as the
North Shore where there are little to no facilities or opportunities to work
out.  However, I’ve also learned that
access to the help people need isn’t always limited by just geography or
finances – many people in all areas are kept from better fitness by barriers
like the fear of bad experiences they’ve had at gyms with intimidating
atmospheres.  I especially want to help
those who fall into this category here in Hawaii, but as mentioned above, in
2013 I also began extending that reach worldwide through some of my online
forms of training services, my free fitness and nutrition newsletter, etc.</p>
<p><b>The
impact you will have by contributing to this campaign is tremendous</b>.  As mentioned before, in lieu of a business
loan, I am seeking funding to help build my business in the following ways:</p><p></p><ul>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">As mentioned, my company is 100% mobile and a large part of the
day to day concerns of my business is making sure that my transportation around
the island of Oahu is highly reliable. 
At some point I would like to be able to afford a hybrid or electric
vehicle (dream car = Tesla!) to be as economical as possible as well as to be
good to the environment, but for now anything that is reliable and somewhat
economical will do!</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">In addition, I have a big place in my heart for people for whom
access to qualitifed fitness help is extremely limited due to financial
concerns and/or geography.  We have quite
a bit of both not only here in Hawaii, but also worldwide, and as mentioned
before, I want to help as many people as I can reach to succeed in living healthier
lives!  Probably the biggest obstacle to
reaching this population that I target is simply the investment in work, time,
and money it takes to get my message out there and reach those who need
it.  Simply stated, funding to accelerate
advertising efforts is needed!</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Although much of what I do with my clients during actual
workouts centers around bodyweight-based workouts and functional movement
training for better day-to-day living, an increase in my supply of training
equipment I can bring with me to mobile training sessions would be a welcomed
addition and would help attract and retain more clients and keep them motivated
and excited about their fitness journey.</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">A major undertaking taking place in 2014 and beyond is to increase my business's community outreach.  So far, plans for this include ""Lunch and Learns"" where I provide a healthy lunch at workplace environments, community meetings, physician's offices, etc. and give informational workshops on various fitness and nutrition topics.  No strings attached, just free lunch and free helpful info!  Also in the works is what I call ""Turbo Trash Pickup"", which are events that are about like they sound - interested community members gather to pick up trash at local parks and beaches but in addition to the service we provide, we're doing so in a speedy way, getting a killer cardiovascular and core workout at the same time!  I hope to be able to fund and/or gain sponsorship for these events in providing refreshments/lunch after the activity.</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Product development and refinement is another big cost in terms
of time and money and this cost will continue to grow as I develop some of the tangible
as well as fitness information products such as books and training programs
mentioned above.</span></li>
</ul><p></p>
<p><b>Perks!</b>  I am very excited about the perks I have to offer contributors
to this campaign in exchange for your help so please check those out!  <i>Additional perks will be added soon.</i>  In addition to the perks offered in this campaign, ALL contributors, regardless of the amount donated, will receive a personal thank you email from me as well as named recognition on my website as a Superhuman Fitness sponsor (unless you'd rather not and choose otherwise - please let me know).</p>

while back from one of my mentors is that if you want to accomplish a really big goal, you need a strong enough ‘why’.  I teach this same concept to my clients and
anyone else I can influence as they strive to reach their fitness goals.  For me personally, I have a couple of
different ‘whys’ that fuel me in what I’m doing – obviously one of these is my
goal to achieve this “Help Count” of at least 1000 people in 2014, but
affecting me even more deeply and moving me to act is the desire and privilege
I have as a father to care for my two young children, age 8 and 5.  You see, in the course of my messy divorce in
which the main issue contested was custody of the children, I lost that battle
and the sole reason given was the fact that at the time of trial, my ex-wife
had a larger and more steady income and better living quarters (don’t get me
started on all the other factors that make this decision so maddening!).  I have always been an extremely involved and
hands-on type of dad, even through the years of graduate and medical school, so
for me this has been a most difficult pill to swallow.  As a result of the legal proceedings and that fact that my children live with their mother most of the time on a separate island in Hawaii, I don't get to see my children nearly as often as I would like or that I feel that they need.  Children need their fathers!  At the same time, however, the fact that finances were the sole determining factor when custody was determined also means that I
have an opportunity and great power to change this custody situation through changing my financial circumstances.  This is what I’m working hard at
accomplishing through my efforts as a fitness professional and entrepreneur.</p>
<p><b>As an educated and
qualified fitness professional</b>, I view what I know and what I do with that
knowledge as a social obligation, and that if I don’t spend the days of my life
trying to convey and help as many people as possible utilize that information
to their benefit, then I am not pulling my weight in society and the space I
occupy in it is basically just a wasted one! 
So I ask you today to please help me to help others and <b><i>bring
Fitness to the People</i></b>!  Mahalo (‘thank
you’) for your time and support!</p><p></p></div>","(Hey, my friend!  Check

For our family, the understanding of Christmas comes in the form of a very scary realization. Yesterday, we got a call that our Dad went to the hospital with gangrene and part of his foot was amputated. Our Dad, Jim Greenleaf, has been through a lot in his life... </span></h3>

<div>Many of you who know him, or have known him (through his work) may have memories about our Dad that are far better then what is written here. For those of you who don't know him, here is a little back story. He has had many injuries and accidents in the past and all of them have brought him to a new chapter in his life. As a young man, James (like so many others) dreamed of pursuing a career as an actor. He also realized that he should invest in the more practical study of his craft so he applied and received a full-ride scholarship to the University of Idaho for theater. Shortly after his time there he broke his leg severely enough and had to quit college to heal and rehabilitate himself. During this intervening time, he lost his scholarship and couldn't afford to return to College. This left him asking all kinds of questions about his future. At the time the only viable solution seemed to join the Navy as a journalist - which he did. The experience taught him discipline and determination and gave him a real sense of purpose and understanding the value for living life to the fullest. He was later honorably discharged and began to re-imagine his future as an actor so he moved to Hollywood to pursue the next ""stage"" of his life.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>His first appearance was on the Gong Show, where he performed a skit of a ping pong match in slow motion. This got the attention of Norman Lear, who called him, and gave him his ""big break"". Seeing the potential in him, Norman gave him a lead role in his show ""All the Glitters"". He was a hit, and the doors blew open. He was cast in movies and in guest starring roles on TV, and at the time people recognized him where ever he went.</div>

<div>A well known <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0339117/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">celebrity by the age of 25</a>, on his way to becoming one of the most sought out comedy Actors in the 80's, starring in hit TV shows like ""Laverne and Shirley"", and ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZP7YOvugBDU"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mork and Mindy</a>"", in blockbuster hits, like ""Night Shift"", and unforgettable films, with co-stars like Matt Dillon and Denzel Washington. He later received a lead role in a Sunday morning cartoon series on NBC, everything seemed to be going great. At the height of his career, he got in a terrible car accident that changed his life and our family forever. As kids, we heard that he was first pronounced dead at the scene. That moment everything changed. But miraculously our Dad came back to life and after two years in the hospital, he made a remarkable recovery. The surgeons performed a never-before-done surgery rebuilding his hip with titanium chains and screws and he underwent rigorous rehabilitation to learn to walk again. Since then he has faced every struggle with optimism attempting to turn every opportunity into a positive and hope-filled situation. Although, he would never reach the level of stardom once anticipated after this life altering accident; he managed to work in a variety of capacities, honing his skills as a character actor, doing stand-up comedy and working odd jobs to pay the bills along the way. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Our Dad loved to play basketball, and with his new limitations he became an even bigger fan from the sidelines. Unable to be as active as he once was he had to come to terms with the effects of a body that needed constant care and attention. With the onset of diabetes and other diseases caused by slowing down of circulation, he has been on a slow and lengthy journey to rediscover health and himself. He was recently married to Marva who believes in him and has helped him to manage a healthy lifestyle, since being married he has lost a lot of weight and he has been healthier than he had been for many years.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>One great passion of his emerged over the past several years - his role as Santa Clause. During this time, thousands of people around the world, have come to appreciate his 'Santa' character and the wisdom he shares in this new role. Jim speaks about diabetes and healthy living all in the context of 'Santa'. With an online presence and occasionally playing 'Santa', Jim and Marva have worked together as Mr. and Mrs. Clause, a jolly couple, bringing joy to kids and families worldwide. This Christmas, Jim and Marva were contracted to be in New York playing the roles of Mr. &amp; Mrs, Clause once more. For five hours each day, they would help each child that visited feel special and intently listened to, and of course kids would get their picture taken. Unfortunately, they were unable to complete their stay. We learned recently that our Dad got a cut on his toe which would not heal a few days ago. Being diabetic this was the first sign he was in trouble. Coupled with a flu like cold, the two made a tough decision to leave New York early and come back home. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>When they arrived two days ago it was clear that something was very wrong. There was a smell coming from his foot that was overpowering and James knew he had to see a doctor right away. When they visited the doctor, they were given a hard blow. They were told it was gangrene and that he needed to go immediately to the hospital...that was 2 days ago. They are still in the hospital today waiting to be given a room. They doctors say that they will have to amputate. As you can imagine this came as really hard news for our Dad and family. So many unanswered questions arose. Now we are wondering what the quality of his life will be from now on? How will he manage to take care of himself and one another? How will he work and pay his rent?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>There is one thing that stands out for us as a major blessing. It is the outpouring of love and support from our friends and family. In the midst of all this our Dad reminded us to simply 'believe'. So, we do, but we are struggling to see how he will be cared for along the way with all that is before him. It is overwhelming. We are hopeful to see and experience the best the human spirit has to show in the way of love, support and generosity through prayers and outpouring of compassion. Already we have received notes of encouragement and people have offered prayers and good wishes. Christmas to us, is exactly this!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Unfortunately, for Jim and Marva they were relying on the money they were going to make from their contract in New York to pay their bills this Holiday season. Now, there is a very real struggle to figure out how they will get by. They are too proud to ask for money themselves. So, this is why our family is appealing to the many people whose hearts 'Santa' has touched over many years in a positive way, to show their best wishes and blessings this holiday season. It is not easy for us to be this open and vulnerable about their circumstances, but we trust 'you' and believe that when people come together to help and serve each other in love, miracles can happen.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Words can't describe the deep sadness we are feeling for our Dad right now. We are still shocked and have not even had time to grieve yet. But it is more important for us to tell his story and to invite you to consider helping our Dad this Christmas Season.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Here is what the money will go toward...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>To help with their bills (rent, utilities, minor medical costs) which would have been paid for if they were able to complete their contract in New York. Becuase of the amputation and rehibilitation, they will need help meeting those needs this Holiday Season.</div>

Why does it sometimes take the most challenging of circumstances to learn the meaning of Christmas? For our family, the understanding of Christmas comes in the form of a very scary realization. Yesterday, we got a call that our Dad went to the hospital with gangrene and part of his foot was amputated. Our Dad, Jim Greenleaf, has been through a lot in his life... 
 

Many of you who know him, or have known him (through his work) may have memories about our Dad that are far better then what is written here. For those of you who don't know him, here is a little back story. He has had many injuries and accidents in the past and all of them have brought him to a new chapter in his life. As a young man, James (like so many others) dreamed of pursuing a career as an actor. He also realized that he should invest in the more practical study of his craft so he applied and received a full-ride scholarship to the University of Idaho for theater.

During this intervening time, he lost his scholarship and couldn't afford to return to College. This left him asking all kinds of questions about his future. At the time the only viable solution seemed to join the Navy as a journalist - which he did. The experience taught him discipline and determination and gave him a real sense of purpose and understanding the value for living life to the fullest. He was later honorably discharged and began to re-imagine his future as an actor so he moved to Hollywood to pursue the next ""stage"" of his life.  
 
His first appearance was on the Gong Show, where he performed a skit of a ping pong match in slow motion. This got the attention of Norman Lear, who called him, and gave him his ""big break"". Seeing the potential in him, Norman gave him a lead role in his show ""All the Glitters"". He was a hit, and the doors blew open. He was cast in movies and in guest starring roles on TV, and at the time people recognized him where ever he went.
