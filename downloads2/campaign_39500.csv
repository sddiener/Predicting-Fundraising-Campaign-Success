<p>Helloooo! I’m Sophie</p>
<p>In August I am off on an awesome trip to Uganda. I am graduating from Southampton Solent University having studied Media Culture and Production (waiting for results so fingers crossed!) In my spare time I love creating digital media and I never stop dancing. I also enjoy cooking. When I found this opportunity advertised I could not believe my luck as it combines my love for digital media with the chance to help primates and travel at the same time. Ever since I was little and began watching programmes such as Planet Earth I always knew I wanted to create media for awareness of animals which are facing great danger. This is a great step in the right direction!</p>
<p><strong>The Adventure</strong></p>
<p>The trip is with a great not-for-profit organization called The Great Primate Handshake who produces digital content to help with the preservation of Primates whilst teaching people like me new skills in media. We will be going into primate sanctuaries and working closely with the staff there to raise awareness through our work. We will be supporting several primate organisations across Uganda and working in locations such as  Kibale Forest to observe important eco-tourism projects.</p>
<p>All of this is made possible by the use of an overland vehicle which enables us to travel across Uganda for the month we are out there.</p>
<p><strong>The Money Bit</strong></p>
<p>As I have to fund this trip I would be so grateful if you could donate some pennies to enable me to do this.</p>
<p>The trip itself costs £1500. This covers accommodation, food, transport once there and production equipment. I also have to fund the cost of the plane tickets, vaccinations and anything I might need on the trip. (Which is about the same amount of money again.) I am going into my local schools to give presentations and raise money through a mufti day and cake sale. I also have a few other local fundraising events up my sleeve. However you can also donate on here. You See that button that says ‘contribute now’, Yep that’s right, the pink one… click it to donate. (go on you know you want to ;-) )  I would LOVE to raise extra so I can donate it to the organization as they do a great job and run by former volunteers.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this and thank you for any donations. I am SO greatful!</p>

Helloooo! I’m Sophie

<h1>The Goal</h1>
<p>Hey Everyone, My name is Michael. I’m the creator of the <a href=""http://www.containers4.me/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Container Project</a>. The container project takes used shipping containers and recycles them into beautiful modern homes.</p>
<p>After a home is constructed it is sold to build two more homes. For every two homes constructed, one container studio will be donated to a family in need.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1267.photobucket.com/albums/jj559/michaelb88/studiotext.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Imagine the container project as a big BOGO ( buy one give one) We build two container homes, sell them and then build a third to give away. This continues to compound, building more sustainable architecture and distributing more homes to families in need.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1267.photobucket.com/albums/jj559/michaelb88/funding-1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h1>With Your Help </h1>
<p>Your Pledges will allow us to build our first container home. This home will feature 6 High Cube Shipping Containers roughly coming out to 2000sqft. It will be a contemporary complex with split level living space. It will be located in Southern California within a 20 mile radius of Los Angeles, California. Your funds will go into purchasing the land and remaining five 40ft high cube shipping containers. </p>
<p>(5) 40ft High Cube containers 40Lx9’6Lx8W-$26000</p>
<p>4000-8000sqft buildable lot (includes water, electricity, gas and septic) $13000+ My $12,000 which is in a 95,000 land/construction loan. </p>
<p>By backing the project or simply sharing it with others, you will be helping the first of many sustainable creations come to life along with helping numerous families once again have shelter. Everyone that participates will also have the ability to directly contact me with ideas and insight on current projects. The more ideas the better the project!</p>
<p>If our goal isn't reach, don't worry. I will keep working to get the project going. We will downsize the Container house to 5 containers not 6, and the plot of land will be smaller. </p>
<p><strong><em>Without your funds we will not be able to start our project, remember any amount helps and is greatly appreciated. Everybody who pledges will get something!</em></strong></p>
<h1>My Story </h1>
<p>I got my inspiration for the Container Project when I worked at the Los Angeles County Muesum of Art(<a href=""http://lacma.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LACMA</a>). While I worked at LACMA, I would walk by their ticketing booths every morning and admire the fact that they were constructed from shipping containers. During my lunch breaks, I would sketch out home designs made entirely from containers. This progressed into 3D renderings and finally I built up the courage to start my own company. With over 10 years of art and design experience and a love for restorations, I have the ability to execute a project of this magnitude.</p>
<p>I have restored 6 classic cars from a 1973 Dodge Charger to a 1985 Lotus Esprit and completed 1000's of pieces of art from mixed media to pen and ink drawings. The task of taking inactive shipping containers and recycling them into beautiful homes is what I was meant to do. I will be working with a skilled architect and a great fabrication company during the first build. This will ensure that everything is done properly and the home will pass the strictest of California regulations.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>Our Build</h1>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1267.photobucket.com/albums/jj559/michaelb88/design.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1267.photobucket.com/albums/jj559/michaelb88/design2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>For our build we will be using 6 retired shipping containers. This home will set a standard for green architecture. If funded, the project can be constructed as soon as February of 2013. After the home is constructed it will immediately be sold and the profit from the project will fund two more builds! Each build will embody the surrounding land and build awareness for the many uses of cargo containers.</p>
<h1>Why Participate? </h1>
<p>More than 300,000,000 containers are rusting away in shipping yards all around the world. These containers have so much more potential than sitting around in shipping yards and by helping us, you will be taking 6 of these containers out of shipping yards and watching the structure come to life on our website.</p>
<p>After the build you will see two new projects blossom from the profit of the first. Along with the two new builds you will get to be part of the donation of a homes to a family in need. Everyone who participates will have their name on a card going to this family. </p>
<p>Used containers are not very expensive and can be modified into a home very quickly. The process of building a container home takes roughly one quarter the time of a traditional home and saves over 50 trees from being cut down.</p>
<p>Container homes have minimal site waste because wood isn't a crucial part of the construction. Think of them as big LEGO pieces, each fitting together seamlessly, creating a strong steel structure.  </p>
<p>Container structures aren't anything new. Many homes have been built from shipping containers, with the most impressive build being a 120 room travel lodge in England. </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1267.photobucket.com/albums/jj559/michaelb88/10217_1_Travelodge2big.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h1>Sustainability </h1>
<p>For every home build, 5-10 containers are being removed from a shipping yard and recycled into a home. Along with the recycling of the containers 50-100+ trees are being saved by constructing the home with containers opposed to wood. </p>
<p>Most of the containers will feature solar power and some will even be<a href=""http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CategoryID=19"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> LEED certified</a>. We will also try to pick up sponsors for energy efficient appliances like laundry machines and dishwashers. </p>
<p>I will be building most of the furniture to go along with the house, which will be constructed sustainably. </p>
<p>Along With recycling the containers, we will be recycling a car to go along with each home. Restoring a car back to its glory causes creates less waste then manufacturing a new one. All cars we restore will be non-running and be brought back to life!</p>
<p>You will be able to track the progress of each build through our website <a href=""http://www.containers4.me/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.Containers4.me</a>. There will be live cams on site, photo journals blogs, and a gallery of all of our designs. </p>

<p>I've started training with my dad and raising money for Muir's March on July 31 to August 3, 2013. Muir's March is a backpacking adventure in Yosemite to raise funds to bring Hetch Hetchy Valley in Yosemite back to life.</p>
<p>A long time ago people put a dam on the river and flooded this part of Yosemite under 300 feet of water. I want to tell people about this wonderful, wild place. I hope to see it fixed during my life.</p>
<p>The closest I have been to camping and hiking in the <img alt=""Scary Raccoon"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s14.postimg.org/vs3hyqh7x/scary_raccoon_s.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 100px; height: 80px; margin: 8px; float: right;""/>mountains is sleeping in our tent in the backyard. I am a little scared about raccoons because they have sharp teeth.</p>
<p><strong>Our goal is to raise $4,800</strong> that will go towards the work to restore Hetch Hetchy Valley. That is $16 for every foot of water that has flooded the Valley.</p>
<p>If I don't reach the fundraising goal my dad and I will not be able to hike Muir's March this summer, but will donate all funds raised to <a href=""http://hetchhetchy.org"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Restore Hetch Hetchy.</a></p>
<p><em>- Allison</em></p>
<h3>A Note From Allison's Dad</h3>
<p>One hundred years ago San Francisco, California launched the modern environmental movement by demanding to use the Hetch Hetchy Valley in <a href=""http://www.nps.gov/yose/index.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Yosemite National Park</a> as a reservoir. The unsuccessful fight to protect this unique ecosystem in the crown jewel of America’s national park system gave birth to the <a href=""http://www.sierraclub.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sierra Club</a>, the <a href=""http://www.nps.gov/index.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">National Park Service</a> and an environmental ethic amongst rank and file Americans.</p>
<p>The battle to restore this extraordinary place comes at a moment in time when we must re-evaluate all aspects of human impact on the environment. Since the Civil War more than 50% of habitat in the lower 48 states has been bulldozed. </p>
<p><strong>If we are serious about protecting the poor and future generations from the impacts of climate change we must launch a comprehensive ecological restoration effort. </strong>Where better to start than in Yosemite National Park?</p>

<h3>More Info: The Work to Restore Hetch Hetchy Valley</h3>
<p>The Hetch Hetchy Valley was described by John Muir as “one of nature’s rarest and most precious mountain temples.” The pristine Tuolumne River flowed along the valley floor, surrounded by flowered meadows and ancient forests which teemed with bears and bobcats, rushes and eagles. Hetch Hetchy Valley was considered one of the most unique and diverse ecosystems in the world.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://hetchhetchy.org/images/stories/parkmap.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Initially protected by the establishment of Yosemite National Park, in 1913 the city of San Francisco won congressional approval to build the O’Shaughnessy Dam which buried this extraordinary wilderness valley under 300 feet of water. Although John Muir was unsuccessful in preventing this from happening, his rigorous campaign resulted in the creation of an international environmental conservation movement.</p>
<p>Modern engineering advances afford us the opportunity to remove the reservoir and <strong>create one of the most ambitious and exciting environmental restoration projects in human history.</strong> As a living laboratory, Hetch Hetchy will advance the science of restoration by providing biologists, ecologists and botanists from all over the world with the chance to apply cutting-edge science to re-establishing lost habitats.</p>
<p>Soon after the valley is drained and the valley floor becomes exposed, Hetch Hetchy could also serve as a classroom for teachers, students and volunteers to experience restoration first hand, with tours for the public to learn about the restoration efforts and the area’s wildlife.</p>
<p>Within five years, native grasses and wildlife would begin to reappear as the Tuolumne River reclaimed its original channel. Willows and alders would quickly return to its banks and, soon after, Ponderosa pines and oak woodlands would begin to take root. As habitat restored itself, large numbers of animals would migrate home and the twin of Yosemite Valley would re-emerge in the light of the 21st century.</p>
<p>Families from around the world will be able to return to Hetch Hetchy Valley year after year to witness a national treasure coming back to life.</p>
<p>A restored Hetch Hetchy Valley will result in:</p>
<ul>
<li>The re-creation of 9 miles of the “wild and scenic” Tuolumne River</li>
<li>The regeneration of 3 square miles of extraordinary wilderness</li>
<li>The restoration of habitat for thousands of animal and plant species</li>
<li>The creation of miles of hiking trails and numerous camp sites</li>
<li>The establishment of an international classroom for restoration scientists</li>

My name is Allison. I'm 8 years old. I live in California. I'm on a mission to help Yosemite.
I've started training with my dad and raising money for Muir's March on July 31 to August 3, 2013. Muir's March is a backpacking adventure in Yosemite to raise funds to bring Hetch Hetchy Valley in Yosemite back to life.
A long time ago people put a dam on the river and flooded this part of Yosemite under 300 feet of water. I want to tell people about this wonderful, wild place. I hope to see it fixed during my life.
The closest I have been to camping and hiking in the mountains is sleeping in our tent in the backyard. I am a little scared about raccoons because they have sharp teeth.
Our goal is to raise $4,800 that will go towards the work to restore Hetch Hetchy Valley. That is $16 for every foot of water that has flooded the Valley.
If I don't reach the fundraising goal my dad and I will not be able to hike Muir's March this summer, but will donate all funds raised to Restore Hetch Hetchy.

A Note From Allison's Dad
One hundred years ago San Francisco, California launched the modern environmental movement by demanding to use the Hetch Hetchy Valley in Yosemite National Park as a reservoir. The unsuccessful fight to protect this unique ecosystem in the crown jewel of America’s national park system gave birth to the Sierra Club, the National Park Service and an environmental ethic amongst rank and file Americans.
The battle to restore this extraordinary place comes at a moment in time when we must re-evaluate all aspects of human impact on the environment. Since the Civil War more than 50% of habitat in the lower 48 states has been bulldozed. 
If we are serious about protecting the poor and future generations from the impacts of climate change we must launch a comprehensive ecological restoration effort. Where better to start than in Yosemite National Park?
Check out our great perks below and thank you for helping our efforts to restore Yosemite.

Muir documented these experiences in The Yosemite, first published in 1912. It is at once a vivid, accurate description of the land and a passionate homage to nature.

More Info: The Work to Restore Hetch Hetchy Valley
The Hetch Hetchy Valley was described by John Muir as “one of nature’s rarest and most precious mountain temples.” The pristine Tuolumne River flowed along the valley floor, surrounded by flowered meadows and ancient forests which teemed with bears and bobcats, rushes and eagles. Hetch Hetchy Valley was considered one of the most unique and diverse ecosystems in the world.

Initially protected by the establishment of Yosemite National Park, in 1913 the city of San Francisco won congressional approval to build the O’Shaughnessy Dam which buried this extraordinary wilderness valley under 300 feet of water. Although John Muir was unsuccessful in preventing this from happening, his rigorous campaign resulted in the creation of an international environmental conservation movement.
Modern engineering advances afford us the opportunity to remove the reservoir and create one of the most ambitious and exciting environmental restoration projects in human history. As a living laboratory, Hetch Hetchy will advance the science of restoration by providing biologists, ecologists and botanists from all over the world with the chance to apply cutting-edge science to re-establishing lost habitats.
Soon after the valley is drained and the valley floor becomes exposed, Hetch Hetchy could also serve as a classroom for teachers, students and volunteers to experience restoration first hand, with tours for the public to learn about the restoration efforts and the area’s wildlife.
Within five years, native grasses and wildlife would begin to reappear as the Tuolumne River reclaimed its original channel. Willows and alders would quickly return to its banks and, soon after, Ponderosa pines and oak woodlands would begin to take root. As habitat restored itself, large numbers of animals would migrate home and the twin of Yosemite Valley would re-emerge in the light of the 21st century.
Families from around the world will be able to return to Hetch Hetchy Valley year after year to witness a national treasure coming back to life.
A restored Hetch Hetchy Valley will result in:

The re-creation of 9 miles of the “wild and scenic” Tuolumne River
The regeneration of 3 square miles of extraordinary wilderness
The restoration of habitat for thousands of animal and plant species
The creation of miles of hiking trails and numerous camp sites
The establishment of an international classroom for restoration scientists

Memphis Botanic Garden and many others. To do this, we need your help. We are working to expand
the number of beehives we have to help us breed a honey bee better suited to surviving in
the modern world.</p>
<p>     We are raising money to be able to purchase 200 more honeybee colonies, a truck, extracting equipment, hive equipment, educational materials, and a honey house. With these, we will be able expand our education
co-operative with Shelby Farms 100 colony project and Grow Memphis. Meeting our fundraising goal will bring us to 400 hives that we manage and allow us to work full time helping the honeybee and managing colonies. It is our goal to one day have
a large honey house with observation hives, windows to view honey extraction,
presentation area, and a garden area containing examples of local honey plants.
Please, help save the honeybee, donate today!</p>
<p>   
 Willie comes from a family of beekeepers and got his first honeybee hive
at 4 years old! He has always had an interest in how bees adapt to their
environment. In his research, he learned that honeybees in New Zealand were
forced to adapt to pests because of a ban on beekeeper there using a pesticides
in the control of mites in their hives. Since learning this he has not
used pesticides in his hives since. He continues to practice selective breeding
to develop a line of honeybees suited to surviving whatever may be thrown their
way.</p>
<p>    George
started keeping bees 5 years ago after working with Willie on taking care of
his hives. He has a strong desire to save the honeybee and has adopted
practices to save them. He actively seeks to save every swarm he is called for
no matter how hard they are to reach. He is also a strong supporter of better
education about the bees, and fights tirelessly to prevent the destruction of
the honeybee!</p><p>     Willie and George started keeping bees together 5 years ago with the common dream to help develop beekeeping practices and to help bees survive the new problems plaguing them in this modern world. We have worked towards these goals by breeding bees for survival traits and staying away from practices we think are harmful to the long term survival of the honey bee.<br/></p>
<p>   
Together, they formed, G&amp;W Honey Farms, a company dedicated to improve bee
health, educating the public, and helping to develop new practices to save the

has been an average loss of 60% of the
honey bee colonies in the U.S. alone. That is a devastating amount to lose so
quickly. It is a truly staggering number when you think of it as 1.5 MILLION domestic honeybee colonies Have Died this year. Without bees, we will lose
so much of our agriculture that is dependent on them for pollination that it
would change the face of the earth! There is hope! With your help, we can save
the bees one hive at a time!  $1 Will Make A Difference!  Donate Now!
     We
are G&W Honey Farms. Our company's goal: to save the bees, one hive at a
time. We are working with Shelby Farms, Grow Memphis, the Memphis Zoo, the
Memphis Botanic Garden and many others. To do this, we need your help. We are working to expand
the number of beehives we have to help us breed a honey bee better suited to surviving in
the modern world.
     We are raising money to be able to purchase 200 more honeybee colonies, a truck, extracting equipment, hive equipment, educational materials, and a honey house. With these, we will be able expand our education
co-operative with Shelby Farms 100 colony project and Grow Memphis. Meeting our fundraising goal will bring us to 400 hives that we manage and allow us to work full time helping the honeybee and managing colonies. It is our goal to one day have
a large honey house with observation hives, windows to view honey extraction,
presentation area, and a garden area containing examples of local honey plants.
Please, help save the honeybee, donate today!
   
 Willie comes from a family of beekeepers and got his first honeybee hive
at 4 years old! He has always had an interest in how bees adapt to their
environment. In his research, he learned that honeybees in New Zealand were
forced to adapt to pests because of a ban on beekeeper there using a pesticides
in the control of mites in their hives. Since learning this he has not
used pesticides in his hives since. He continues to practice selective breeding
to develop a line of honeybees suited to surviving whatever may be thrown their
way.
    George
started keeping bees 5 years ago after working with Willie on taking care of
his hives. He has a strong desire to save the honeybee and has adopted
practices to save them. He actively seeks to save every swarm he is called for
no matter how hard they are to reach. He is also a strong supporter of better
education about the bees, and fights tirelessly to prevent the destruction of
the honeybee!     Willie and George started keeping bees together 5 years ago with the common dream to help develop beekeeping practices and to help bees survive the new problems plaguing them in this modern world. We have worked towards these goals by breeding bees for survival traits and staying away from practices we think are harmful to the long term survival of the honey bee.
   
Together, they formed, G&W Honey Farms, a company dedicated to improve bee
health, educating the public, and helping to develop new practices to save the
honeybee. Together with Shelby Farms, Grow Memphis, the Memphis Zoo, and the Memphis
Botanic Garden we are working toward raising awareness for the honeybee's
plight, and help to teach a younger generation the joys and wonder that come
with keeping bees. If you visit the zoo, stop by and see the observation hive.

Institutional recognition from:
          


Conceived at the University of California at Berkeley, .Ozone Drive
brings to life the ideal of sustainable mobility, where the pollutant
emissions, noise level, and ecological footprint fall radically down to zero.
We are transforming mobility by facilitating access to electric vehicles. 
[ Each $5000 received will translate into a new full electric vehicle incorporated to our fleet for 1 year ]FEATURED REWARDS


 Plant and Name your Tree









 Test-drive a Full Electric Car !


 Attend Formula E Race, London



OUR BUSINESS MODEL
.Ozone Drive currently promotes EVs along the
Mediterranean islands, starting with Spain. We target customers who are willing
to have a daily positive impact in the world, and provide them a risk-free
opportunity to experience electric cars, through a clean, emotional and
attractive brand, strongly attached to their values, lifestyle, environmental
awareness and aspirations. By partnering with major hotel chains and car manufacturers, we facilitate access to electric charging, thus assuring a perfect rental experience and a complete solution for electromobility for the first time in the industry.We invite you to have a better taste on our services watching real .Ozone Drive user experiences at our website. They are incredibly fun !WHERE ARE WE TODAY?We have already launched our services in the Balearic Islands in 2014 and have created an important impact, not only in terms of electric car driving experiences, but also in terms of media atenttion to EVs, featuring .Ozone Drive in some of the most prestigious media channels in Europe.WHERE ARE WE GOING NEXT?


We will focus first on expanding our services across some of the most attractive and impactful locations in the Mediterranean islands. However, we will also consider transatlantic opportunities of development as they arise. The Caribbean, Florida, California, or Hawaii represent some of the locations where we would love to operate in the future.


WHY DO WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT ?
.Ozone Drive expansion strategy is currently limited upon its partnerships with hotels and car manufacturers for the distribution of its electric rental services. In order to expand organically, .Ozone Drive needs the financial capacity to manage its own fleet of 100% electric vehicles.
After market validation and the overwhelming customer acceptance of the .Ozone Drive Electric Road Show in 2014 (http://electricroadshow.ozonedrive.com/), we need your support to launch a PERMANENT rental fleet in the Balearic Islands (Mallorca, Menorca, Ibiza). This will enable us to deploy more EV services along the Mediterranean and achieve sustainable growth.
Your donations will help us afford the leasing costs of our electric fleet: ($5,000 leasing cost/car/year). Therefore:

Each $5000 received will translate into a new full electric vehicle incorporated to our fleet for 1 year.

AWARDS & RECOGNITIONS

Our challenge is rapidly changing from simply obtaining genomic, epigenomic, and toxicological data to interpreting and using that data to improve human health. We will examine how exposures and the environment continue to shape the genome of individuals and populations. We will further learn how measuring or imputing the response of the genome and epigenome to environmental agents is providing powerful new approaches for understanding the genetic impacts of human exposures.</p>

The 47th Annual Meeting of the EMGS

Enabling technologies have driven our knowledge of the structure and content of the human genome and epigenome to dizzying heights and are empowering large scale toxicological assessments. Our challenge is rapidly changing from simply obtaining genomic, epigenomic, and toxicological data to interpreting and using that data to improve human health. We will examine how exposures and the environment continue to shape the genome of individuals and populations. We will further learn how measuring or imputing the response of the genome and epigenome to environmental agents is providing powerful new approaches for understanding the genetic impacts of human exposures.
EMGS 2016 focus topics:

Mechanisms of DNA damage and repair, somatic and germline mutagenesis, and their genomic signatures in health and disease.
Ways in which the environment modifies the epigenome and thus gene expression.

<p>Well friends, we find ourselves in the final 20 days of our campaign with only a handfull of supporters. We aren't certain why this important project has gained little interest. The Peoria Journal Star published an informative column about our efforts and one of the local tv stations aired us as well, perhaps we set the goal too high? Or maybe it's the flexible funding format we chose? Rest assured, every penny collected will go toward purchasing the equipment we need to make this venture progress.</p>
<p>Most of the commercial fishing men and women in this area have been unemployed since this spring when the last fish meal contract at Big River Fisherie ran out. We just want to get back to work!

<p>My name is Gene Sperry Jr., a licensed commercial fisherman (#1138) from Peoria County, Peoria, Illinois soliciting your interest in helping us save the Illinois River ecosystem and helping feed thousands of people around the planet.</p>
<p>If you are from the Midwest, or anywhere for that matter, you are probably aware of issues we are having with Asian Carp in our rivers and lakes.  The Asian Carp is an invasive species that escaped from fish farms and water purification systems in the southern U.S. in the 1980s and these fish have been migrating north via the Mississippi River ever since.  They are now well established here in Peoria, IL and have been for quite some time.  Asian Carp are not bottom feeders; they grow very quickly by filter-feeding on green/brown algae and plankton.  Their feeding habits and rapid growth make them low in contaminants, and high in nutrition and Omega 3 oils.  The downside of their type of feeding is that they eat their own body weight in less than a week, disrupting the river’s ecosystem by over-consuming on the diet of the river’s native species.</p>

<p>Brian Ickes, of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) in a May 18th 2012 report, states:  “As far as wild populations go, the greatest density of Asian Carp on the planet now likely exists in Illinois waters of the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers."" </p>
<p>Josephine Marcotty of StarTribune adds:  ""The Mississippi and Illinois Rivers have more Asian Carp than anywhere else on the planet.  Even more than China where they came from.” </p>
<p>The Canadian and U.S. fisheries on the Great Lakes are scared.  If the Asian Carp population enters the Great Lakes, it may choke out the salmon and destroy the charter fishing industry.  So what is being done to prevent this potential attack on the Great Lakes?  Electrified barriers have been placed across waterways leading to the Great Lakes.  Meanwhile, the Asian Carp population south of those barriers is growing at an alarming rate. </p>
<p>Currently, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) has hired teams of commercial fishermen to harvest Asian Carp from the waterways between Spring Valley and Morris, in an effort to reduce the number of Asian Carp reaching the electrified barriers, at a cost to the taxpayers of well over $40,000 per week.  The harvested fish are then donated to be processed into organic fertilizer.  In our estimation, this is a waste of this resource.  So what else is being done to reduce the population of Asian Carp in the Illinois River to slow their migration toward Chicago and the Great Lakes? </p>
<p>Multimillion dollar Asian Carp processing plants have been proposed for years and yet, to date, none have been built in Illinois.  When they <em>are</em> constructed, they will most likely process the harvested Asian Carp into fertilizer or fish meal to be used in animal feed.  This is not utilizing the Asian Carp to their full potential.  The harvested fish should be used to feed <em>people</em>. </p>
<p>That being said, there are two small, private Illinois companies that market Asian Carp for human consumption:  Schafer Fisheries located in Thompson, Illinois and Big River Fish located in Pearl, Illinois.  Both companies have facilities that process fresh iced fish and frozen fillets for sale in markets and restaurants across the U.S. and also ship small amounts to foreign countries to be served in high-end restaurants.  Both of these facilities are relatively small and only employ a handful of fishermen, creating little impact on the Asian Carp population. </p>
<p>At its average water level, the Illinois River pool at Peoria, Illinois covers 352 square miles of water in which the Asian carp spawn, live, thrive, and migrate towards the Chicago waterways and the Great Lakes. This is <em>352 square miles</em> of water holding hundreds of thousands of pounds of Asian Carp that are not being harvested because there is no local facility to process the fish. </p>
<p>We, the fishermen of the Peoria area, believe multimillion dollar plants harvesting Asian Carp to make fertilizer and animal feed or dump them in landfills is not the answer.  Throughout the world there is a market for frozen, whole fish to help feed the masses which utilizes the whole fish and wastes nothing.  Flash freezing the whole fish as soon as it comes out of the water and shipping them in large freezer containers will make freshly frozen fish affordable for everyone.  With our proposed facility, there is no processing, very little overhead, and no waste.  We just catch them, freeze them, ship them and feed people.  Our goal is to develop a pilot program that involves a spiral flash freezer facility on the river where the Asian Carp are harvested.  The spiral flash freezer facility can be constructed for 1/10th of the cost of building a full-scale processing plant.  Simple successful operations on the river’s edge could create jobs and opportunities for many communities on the Illinois River. </p>
<p>We are seeking funding/sponsors/donations so that we can acquire the rest of the equipment that we need to make this project a reality.  Please find it in your heart to help.  This project will have a positive impact on the lives of many people.  We already have property with river access, two plate boats, gear, trained fishermen, buildings to house the spiral freezer, and storage containers.  We need some aircraft/marine-grade aluminum to construct more plate boats (we have a professional boat builder on site), outboard motors, more gear, and a spiral flash freezer.  By purchasing a used and reconditioned spiral flash freezer and building our own boats with donated aluminum and outboard motors, we can begin the ""Illinois River Asian Carp Abatement Project"" for around $350,000. </p>
<p>It’s a pretty hefty goal that will take many donations from concerned people to reach, but it's also a far cry from the millions it will cost the government and its taxpayers to construct a plant to process fertilizer and fish meal.  With your help, in a few months we can be up 'n' running, feeding people and taking some of the pressure off of the Chicago waterways.  With your donations to the ""Illinois River Asian Carp Abatement Project,"" we can demonstrate better solutions.  Let’s feed <em>people</em> and stop spending taxpayer dollars. </p>
<p>Well friends, that's Plan A and if we can't reach the goal of $200,000 then we'll go to Plan B. Plan B is a goal of $100,000 so we can acquire boats for two more crews and purchase a refrigerated semi trailer so we can haul our harvest to an existing plant in Iowa, then maybe next year we can afford to purchase the much needed spiral freezer. If we cannot reach the goal of $100,000 for Plan B then we'll be looking at Plan C, which is a goal of $30,000  for boats and gear for one more crew and put a box cooler and a refrigerator unit on a truck we already have.</p>
<p>Please help us with this project before everything gets out of control and big brother shows up and thinks the only solution is to come in and poison the river and start over! The poisons are already being stockpiled.</p>

<h3>A coast-to-coast walk to talk about climate change</h3>
<p><a href=""http://climate-walker.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">climate-walker.org</a></p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>My name is David Henry. I'm a husband and father of two, an information technology professional, a musician, and a walking advocate. I'm very concerned about climate change – concerned about what we are leaving future generations – concerned about how we will adapt – concerned that not enough people are concerned.  It's very frustrating that the national conversation about climate change is still focused on whether or not it is a problem - or that it is someone else's problem.  I'm concerned enough that I can no longer continue with business as usual. So, I'm taking a career sabbatical to walk from Boston to Los Angeles – 3,500 miles – to start new conversations about climate change. </p>

<h3>Starting a new conversation</h3>
<p>My goal is to have at least 100 good conversations with people from all walks of life.  A good conversation is one where I listen to you and you listen to me.  I'm not aiming to convince you to do something specific - instead I think our conversation would be successful if you take ownership of the climate change problem in your own way and continue the conversation with others.</p>
<p>I’m not trying to make anyone feel guilty.  It does no good to spread guilt. Instead I’d like to spread hope – hope that we can meet the coming challenges – hope that we can turn those challenges into opportunities – hope that we can all work together.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How you can help me</h3>
I will be walking over 3,500 miles from Boston to Los Angeles.  Based on my research, I expect this will take somewhere between 6 and 7 months.  I'm asking for your support.  First and forenost is moral support - I'd love to hear from others who have the same sense of urgency about climate change.  I'd also love to hear your suggestions to make this journey more successful.  On a practical level, any monetary donations you provide will help me with equipment, provisions, occasional lodging etc.  My estimate of the equipment, provisions, and occasional lodging is about $5,000.  Any donations would be apopreciated and I will thank you personally at some levels.  At higher donation levels you can sponsor a specific city-to-city segment of my walk - you can even specify which cities (by refering to my route at <a href=""http://climate-walker.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://climate-walker.org</a>).  At the $1000 level you can sponsor my walk across an entire state.</div></div>","A coast-to-coast walk to talk about climate change
climate-walker.org
Hello,
My name is David Henry. I'm a husband and father of two, an information technology professional, a musician, and a walking advocate. I'm very concerned about climate change – concerned about what we are leaving future generations – concerned about how we will adapt – concerned that not enough people are concerned.  It's very frustrating that the national conversation about climate change is still focused on whether or not it is a problem - or that it is someone else's problem.  I'm concerned enough that I can no longer continue with business as usual. So, I'm taking a career sabbatical to walk from Boston to Los Angeles – 3,500 miles – to start new conversations about climate change.

<p>I discovered my passion for the outdoors through wilderness travel in the BWCA and Canada with YMCA Camp Menogyn. In 2011, I was one of the first two women to paddle 2,000 miles from <a href=""http://vimeo.com/24996375"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Minneapolis to Hudson Bay</a>, recreating Eric Sevareid's route from <em>Canoeing With the Cree</em>. That trip inspiring me to start a non-profit called <a href=""http://www.wildriveracademy.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Wild River Academy</a>. <span>Wild River Academy provides canoe expeditions along the Minnesota River. Trips stop along the route to interact with environmental organizations, community members, Dakota people, farmers, and State Park Rangers. This experiential learning opportunity not only enhances outdoor skills, it exposes participants to the social and natural environment in the Minnesota River watershed, encouraging a sense of peace and place.</span></p>
<p>I am gearing up for my next big adventure, but I need your help!</p>
<p>In the fall of 2013, I, along with eight other people, will embark on and film a three month long canoe journey down the Mississippi River from the headwaters in Lake Itasca, Minnesota, to New Orleans. As we paddle, we will engage communities in an ongoing dialogue about their relationships to and interactions with this watertrail to give voice to the Mississippi River, its inhabitants, and the many perspectives we encounter along the way. Upon completion of the trip, we will produce a documentary of this journey so that these vital conversations can continue with others beyond the flow of the river.</p>
<h3>
<strong>Why Paddle the Mississippi?</strong> </h3>
<p>As the climate debate comes to a head in the United States, it’s easy to get caught up in abstract political jargon and lose sight of the everyday people whose lives revolve around the health of a natural resource. I love paddling rivers that encompass an array of social and environmental issues because they tell a great story. One that needs to be heard.</p>

<p align=""center"">In just 10 years, half of Paraguay’s pristine natural habitats have been lost. The country’s agricultural output has been booming, but at a massive environmental cost. Too many habitats are being destroyed all over the world, particularly in developing countries.</p>
<p align=""center"">We want to reverse the trend in Paraguay, and we need your help.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Reversing the Trend</span></strong></h2>
<p>Para La Tierra (PLT) is a small not-for-profit conservation organization dedicated to protecting threatened ecosystems throughout Paraguay.</p>
<p>Since 2010, we’ve been stationed at Reserva Natural Laguna Blanca (RNLB), a beautiful nature reserve located at the meeting point of two of Paraguay’s threatened habitats: the Cerrado and the Atlantic Forest. Both of these habitats have suffered dreadfully over the past two decades. Through the development of large scale agriculture, these once lush habitats have been converted into open fields for cattle pasture. Today, only fragments remain untouched but thanks to government regulations and projects like ours the majority of these fragments are now protected. Sadly, it’s too little too late. The large businesses have already staked their claim in these two habitats and are looking for a new habitat to exploit. The Gran Chaco is their next target.</p>
<p>Chaco, in the indigenous language of Quechua, can be translated to mean, ‘the Land of Great Hunting’ and contains a huge biodiversity. It is South America’s largest dry forest and is home to the largest mammal on the continent – the Guanaco. While the indigenous tribes call the land ‘el Gran Chaco,’ the conquistadors called it ‘El Verde Infierno’ or The Green Hell. Boasting the continent’s highest temperature and a myriad of thorny plants, the early settlers disregarded it as useless land. Unfortunately, this view has recently changed. Through developments in technology, agriculture in the Chaco has not only become feasible but it has become profitable. This has led to rapid development of the area and massive destruction of the habitat in the past few years. 10% of the Paraguayan Chaco wilderness was converted to cattle land in 2012 alone, displacing countless indigenous tribes that call the forest home. But, with your help, we can help put a stop to this movement.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What We Do</span></strong></h2>
<p>According to National Geographic, Para La Tierra has created a new model for conservation organizations. We understand that there is no ‘silver bullet’ solution to the worldwide destruction of habitats, but we firmly believe that this is a battle worth fighting. PLT is committed to the protection of threatened habitats through scientific research, community outreach and environmental education. </p>

We have created the largest single-site reference collection in the country. We have published 19 scientific papers in international peer-reviewed journals. And our museum attracts over 1,000 visitors a year. In addition to publishing scientific papers, we promote conservation issues through public and social media, inclusion on Eco-Index, and news articles posted in large worldwide newspapers including Geo Mundo, Business India, The Times and The Daily Mail in addition to the IUCN and National Geographic websites. Our blogs receive over 500 hits a month. Our scientific papers have led to improved conservation plans and our media influence has helped raise the status of Paraguayan conservation issues to a global level.</p>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<h3 align=""center""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Community Support</span></strong></h3>
<p>Para La Tierra’s main focus in fostering change, encouraging conservation and protecting habitats has been to educate young people who live around the reserve. We’ve designed and implemented a customized environmental education curriculum for elementary and high school students. We’ve hosted on-site workshops for local community leaders designed to impart a new appreciation for their country’s amazing biodiversity. After PLT’s founder, Karina Atkinson, won the Rolex Award for Enterprise, PLT was able to build three chicken coops in the surrounding communities. This project has provided families close to the reserve a source of protein and income so they don’t need to enter the reserve to hunt for food.</p>

<p align=""center""> </p>
<h3 align=""center""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The Next Generation</span></strong></h3>
<p>Students, graduates and professionals from all over the world have come to PLT’s ecological research center at RNLB for the chance to study the local biodiversity. These visitors are inspired by the beautiful wildlife they see. We have trained students from over 60 universities in a variety of field sampling techniques, preparing them for a future career in conservation biology.</p>

<p>Each year, we have grown to train more and more interns. The majority of former PLT interns continue to post-graduate education but others have found jobs at zoos, rehabilitation centers, and other conservation organizations using PLT as a stepping stone towards a career in conservation.

<h2><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Why We NEED You</span></strong></h2>
<p>This successful new approach to conservation has given PLT the drive to do more. Our mission is to protect ALL of Paraguay’s habitats by transplanting our model conservation organization to each environment in the country. Before the year is out, we plan to expand to a second field site located on a massive reserve in Paraguay’s fastest disappearing habitat: the Gran Chaco. As you read this, more of its vast landscapes are being burned down and converted into cattle ranches.</p>
<p><img alt=""Progress"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/264594_10200251681998343_1312254683_n.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Progress""/></p>
<p>This expansion will create a huge variety of opportunities for PLT and ensure the conservation of the Chaco. With your help, PLT will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run the first ever year-round research station in the Paraguayan Chaco, providing the scientific justification for the protection of the Chaco.</li>
<li>Demonstrate the beauty and importance of this little-known habitat to a wider audience.</li>
<li>Install a training centre for a new generation of young Paraguayan and international scientists.</li>
<li>Conduct a scientific inventory of the Chaco’s flora and fauna leading to new discoveries for the region and the development of an informed conservation plan.</li>
<li>Welcome interns who will carry out pioneering investigations into how life survives in this hostile habitat.</li>
<li>Give tourists the unique opportunity to actively participate in nature conservation where they contribute positively to environmental issues.</li>
<li>Promote Chaco conservation issues in the media, sparking further interest in its protection.</li>
<li>Invite university biology classes to learn skills and gain experience that can’t be taught in a classroom.</li>
<li>Engage with the local indigenous tribes, providing environmental education to their children and ensuring the survival of their culture.</li>

<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">With £5000:</span></p>
<p>                We would open a field site in the Gran Chaco, installing electricity, plumbing, and internet. We would stock the house with necessary amenities such as beds, a cooker, a fridge, and showers. This would provide us the bare essentials we need to begin welcoming students and professionals to conduct research in the Chaco.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">With £10,000:</span></p>
<p>                We would be able to do all of the above as well as renovate a second building to open the first-ever natural history museum in the Chaco. It would be fitted with an air conditioning unit, dehumidifier and custom-made display units. An on-site museum would provide us with a place to store our scientific collection as well as a place to host educational workshops. Our museum at RNLB has been incredibly successful both as a scientific asset as well as an educational tool.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">With £20,000:</span></p>
<p>                We would be able to buy specialist scientific equipment which would allow us to do more in-depth study on the local flora and fauna. This would include microscopes, radio collars, GPS trackers, GPS units, camera traps etc. This equipment would take our projects to the next level and advance our knowledge of Paraguayan flora and fauna.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">With £500,000:</span></p>
<p>                We would be able to afford the purchase of a plot of threatened habitat to convert into a reserve. This would give us the freedom to manage a reserve with the sole purpose of conservation and investigation. Our first choice would be the land on which our flagship species – the White-winged Nightjar – lives and breeds. It is an endangered species with an estimated population size under 2,500. The land is currently owned by AgroForestal Rio Verde S.A. and they are using it for Eucalyptus plantations. With such a large sum of money, PLT would be able to provide protection for habitats in need of conservation.</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p></div>","In just 10 years, half of Paraguay’s pristine natural habitats have been lost. The country’s agricultural output has been booming, but at a massive environmental cost. Too many habitats are being destroyed all over the world, particularly in developing countries.
We want to reverse the trend in Paraguay, and we need your help.
 
Reversing the Trend
Para La Tierra (PLT) is a small not-for-profit conservation organization dedicated to protecting threatened ecosystems throughout Paraguay.
Since 2010, we’ve been stationed at Reserva Natural Laguna Blanca (RNLB), a beautiful nature reserve located at the meeting point of two of Paraguay’s threatened habitats: the Cerrado and the Atlantic Forest. Both of these habitats have suffered dreadfully over the past two decades. Through the development of large scale agriculture, these once lush habitats have been converted into open fields for cattle pasture. Today, only fragments remain untouched but thanks to government regulations and projects like ours the majority of these fragments are now protected. Sadly, it’s too little too late. The large businesses have already staked their claim in these two habitats and are looking for a new habitat to exploit. The Gran Chaco is their next target.
Chaco, in the indigenous language of Quechua, can be translated to mean, ‘the Land of Great Hunting’ and contains a huge biodiversity. It is South America’s largest dry forest and is home to the largest mammal on the continent – the Guanaco. While the indigenous tribes call the land ‘el Gran Chaco,’ the conquistadors called it ‘El Verde Infierno’ or The Green Hell. Boasting the continent’s highest temperature and a myriad of thorny plants, the early settlers disregarded it as useless land. Unfortunately, this view has recently changed. Through developments in technology, agriculture in the Chaco has not only become feasible but it has become profitable. This has led to rapid development of the area and massive destruction of the habitat in the past few years. 10% of the Paraguayan Chaco wilderness was converted to cattle land in 2012 alone, displacing countless indigenous tribes that call the forest home. But, with your help, we can help put a stop to this movement.
 
What We Do
According to National Geographic, Para La Tierra has created a new model for conservation organizations. We understand that there is no ‘silver bullet’ solution to the worldwide destruction of habitats, but we firmly believe that this is a battle worth fighting. PLT is committed to the protection of threatened habitats through scientific research, community outreach and environmental education. 

 
Global Awareness
 
Through our work at RNLB, we have discovered over 50 new species for Paraguay. We have created the largest single-site reference collection in the country. We have published 19 scientific papers in international peer-reviewed journals. And our museum attracts over 1,000 visitors a year. In addition to publishing scientific papers, we promote conservation issues through public and social media, inclusion on Eco-Index, and news articles posted in large worldwide newspapers including Geo Mundo, Business India, The Times and The Daily Mail in addition to the IUCN and National Geographic websites. Our blogs receive over 500 hits a month. Our scientific papers have led to improved conservation plans and our media influence has helped raise the status of Paraguayan conservation issues to a global level.
 
Community Support
Para La Tierra’s main focus in fostering change, encouraging conservation and protecting habitats has been to educate young people who live around the reserve. We’ve designed and implemented a customized environmental education curriculum for elementary and high school students. We’ve hosted on-site workshops for local community leaders designed to impart a new appreciation for their country’s amazing biodiversity. After PLT’s founder, Karina Atkinson, won the Rolex Award for Enterprise, PLT was able to build three chicken coops in the surrounding communities. This project has provided families close to the reserve a source of protein and income so they don’t need to enter the reserve to hunt for food.

 
The Next Generation
Students, graduates and professionals from all over the world have come to PLT’s ecological research center at RNLB for the chance to study the local biodiversity. These visitors are inspired by the beautiful wildlife they see. We have trained students from over 60 universities in a variety of field sampling techniques, preparing them for a future career in conservation biology.

Each year, we have grown to train more and more interns. The majority of former PLT interns continue to post-graduate education but others have found jobs at zoos, rehabilitation centers, and other conservation organizations using PLT as a stepping stone towards a career in conservation.

Why We NEED You
This successful new approach to conservation has given PLT the drive to do more. Our mission is to protect ALL of Paraguay’s habitats by transplanting our model conservation organization to each environment in the country. Before the year is out, we plan to expand to a second field site located on a massive reserve in Paraguay’s fastest disappearing habitat: the Gran Chaco. As you read this, more of its vast landscapes are being burned down and converted into cattle ranches.

This expansion will create a huge variety of opportunities for PLT and ensure the conservation of the Chaco. With your help, PLT will:

Run the first ever year-round research station in the Paraguayan Chaco, providing the scientific justification for the protection of the Chaco.
Demonstrate the beauty and importance of this little-known habitat to a wider audience.
Install a training centre for a new generation of young Paraguayan and international scientists.
Conduct a scientific inventory of the Chaco’s flora and fauna leading to new discoveries for the region and the development of an informed conservation plan.
Welcome interns who will carry out pioneering investigations into how life survives in this hostile habitat.
Give tourists the unique opportunity to actively participate in nature conservation where they contribute positively to environmental issues.
Promote Chaco conservation issues in the media, sparking further interest in its protection.
Invite university biology classes to learn skills and gain experience that can’t be taught in a classroom.
Engage with the local indigenous tribes, providing environmental education to their children and ensuring the survival of their culture.

</div></div>","Hello! My name is Sinéad Reynolds and I am a 23 year old Masters by Research student at the University of Glasgow, studying Ecology and Environmental Biology.I have been award an Amazon Scholarship by the Crees foundation am heading out to the Manu Biosphere in South-Eastern Peru to conduct research into the use of rainforest clay licks by large mammals - notably the fascinating South American Tapir and Red Brocket deer. 


Threatened by habitat loss, these animals are important species to focus on. The South American Tapir is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN red list, whilst the conservation status of Red Brocket remains undetermined due to lack of research. Whilst previous research has focused on avian use of clay licks, the importance of these sites to rainforest mammals has not been addressed. Using non-toxic paint marking, to help identify individuals, I aim to safely monitor how often these animals are returning to drink from the clay licks which will ultimately give insight into the importance of these areas to rainforest ecology.What We Need
At around £200 for 1 camera trap, this is not a cheap venture! 
Ideally, we would like to raise enough for 6 camera traps - 3 at each clay lick site - however if we can raise for 3 or 4 this may also be possible or the study will be focused at a single site. 
All funds raised will go to camera trap equipment for the crees foundation.
The Impact
My project will contribute to the overall research being conducted by the Crees foundation. Based at the Manu Learning Centre in the Manu Biosphere Reserve, Crees strive towards a sustainable future for the Amazon. By working closely with local communities as well as researchers from all over the world, conservation issues can be tackled efficiently.
With little currently known about the use of clay licks by mammals, particularly in rain-forests, donations towards camera traps will allow us to begin to fill this gap in knowledge and potentially allow for a new method of large mammal population monitoring in rainforest ecosystems!

<p></p><p></p><p>Trails serve as arteries for adventure throughout America’s
system of public lands. Benefits provided to society from a robust system of publicly-accessible
trails include improved fitness and well-being, opportunities to connect
families and children with nature, tourism and economic growth related to
outdoor recreation. The public loves and wants to stay connected with its
national parks, national forests and public lands.</p>
<p>The U.S. Forest Service alone is responsible for over 158,000
miles of trails throughout 155 national forests and grasslands. <b>Yet in</b> <b>2012,</b> <b>the Forest Service was
able to maintain only 37 percent of its trails. Only one-quarter of its trail
miles meet agency standards for public use. Government resources to maintain
trails have shrunk while public demand for trails in our national parks and
forests continues to climb. </b>The “backlog” in trail maintenance only grows worse
each year. Despite increased volunteer efforts by Back Country Horsemen and
others, our nation’s public lands are becoming increasingly inaccessible. </p>
<p><b>The Crisis:</b></p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Deteriorating and often impassible trail conditions across the
country</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Backlog in trail maintenance and resultant trail closures</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Lack of awareness among elected officials about the benefits of
public trails</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Diminishing agency budgets for outdoor recreation</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Increasing demand for volunteer organizations like BCHA
to maintain more trail miles each year</span><br/>
</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>In 2013, the Government Accountability Office estimated that nearly
a quarter of Forest Service trail maintenance comes from state funding, other
federal and non-federal sources, and volunteers and partners like BCHA. This
need is expected to grow as Congress continues to place low priority on public
lands funding.</p>
<p><b>Our Solutions:</b></p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Strengthening BCHA’s capacity as a leading voice among public land
and trail stewardship organizations</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Demonstrating the wide range of institutions and organizations who

</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Amplifying the message and collaboration of Back Country Horsemen

<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Sustaining volunteerism by engaging today’s youth as the next
generation of public land stewards</span><br/>
</li>

quilt to find a good home is through the Back Country Horsemen of America.
Included on the red, white and blue panel is a quote from each of the four
presidents. There is a sleeve for hanging the quilt or you can use it for lap
quilt.  May you enjoy “Heart of South Dakota” as much as I have in the
process of creating it."" Peg Greiwe Executive Secretary, Back Country

You
to everyone that contributed.  Thank You to all the chapters
that met the Lori Lennox and Grays Harbor Chapter Challenge.  Thank
You to all the state presidents that encouraged their members to spread the
word.  And a special Thank You to the Foundation, a longtime supporter of the
BCHA, that posted the $25,000 Challenge Grant – a Challenge that was met by the
members and friends of the Back Country Horsemen of America. Beyond Grateful!WE'RE ONLY HOURS AWAY FROM THE END! CAN WE PUSH TO REACH A STRETCH GOAL OF $65,000? All monies received over the $50,000 goal will be split 50/50 with BCH state
organizations and chapters via the BCHA Education Foundation.Let's keep pushing and sharing the incredible mission of BCHA through this campaign to see how far we can go!!!Why the Campaign?Because our trails on public lands need you. Like you, the men and women of Back Country Horsemen of America (BCHA) care about protecting and sustaining a safe and accessible outdoor experience for our families and future generations. But we can't do it alone. We count on our partners and you to help us preserve access to public lands. In 2012, only 37% of the 158,000 miles of National Forest Service trails received basic maintenance. Only one-quarter of these trails meet standard regulation for public use. Gaps of investment, oversight, and maintenance point to a future with fewer sustainable trails in our 144 National Forests. The funds from this campaign will increase BCHA's capacity to drive a national campaign to address the growing trail maintenance backlog on our public lands. BCHA, along with partner The Wilderness Society, have become the catalyst of a national discussion with Congress, agency leaders and the nation's recreation community regarding solutions for keeping trails open and enjoyable for everyone--hikers, hunters, anglers, bird-watchers, bicyclists and horsemen alike! With our decades-long track record of volunteerism and ""sweat equity"" in keeping America's trails open for you, BCHA's crowdfunding effort will secure our role in the campaign to secure sustainable solutions to the Nation's trail maintenance crisis.Please take a few minutes to support and share our campaign! Trails may be owned by government entities, but volunteers are needed to keep them open and maintained. Who are the Back Country Horsemen?BCHA are men and women who belong to a national non-profit organization. We are a 501(c)(3) serving 174 local and state chapters across the country. Our grassroots members—responsible leaders who help to carry forward our organization’s mission and values—lead BCHA organizations throughout the United States. BCHA chapters are active in 27 states consisting of over 13,000 members who are dedicated to keeping trails open for everyone on our public lands. Our chapters work closely with trail partners and local land management agencies to clear and maintain those trails. Are you a hiker, biker, or horseback rider who gets out and enjoys trails? We do much of the work that goes unseen to clear trails and preserve the safety and continued enjoyment of your outdoor experience. Yes, much of our work does in fact involve ""horsepower"" as well as human power. The majority of our pack trips with horses and mules are to assist trail crews get food, camping gear, and trail maintenance equipment into areas where four-wheeled vehicles cannot go.Campaign Partners:Our campaign partners below are equally committed to seeing that your trails remain accessible. Please take a minute to visit their websites to learn more about our partner's important work to keep trails open for you.What Does BCHA Do?In 2012, Back Country Horsemen of America volunteers spent 372,000 hours working to maintain trails on public lands.  That equates to a value of $12.5 million dollars in trail work donated to local and federal land managing agencies. Since 1995, BCHA members contributed a value equal to $86.66 million in volunteer hours. We invest in active participation by young leaders in the wise and sustainable use of wilderness and back country resources. We coordinate with conservation corps and youth groups, United States Forest Service, National Park Service, and Bureau of Land Management to ensure tomorrow's leaders have outdoor and wilderness experiences. As youth groups work with us and our partners, they learn about themselves and about stewardship of our most treasured resources. BCHA, its youth partners, and other volunteers leverage funds many times over in delivering projects to clear and maintain trails.The costs to clear, maintain, work, and log trails are substantial. Responsible stewardship of the land means more than just doing good work—it means making the most out of every donation we receive.The Crisis for America's Trails—And Our Solution
Trails serve as arteries for adventure throughout America’s
system of public lands. Benefits provided to society from a robust system of publicly-accessible
trails include improved fitness and well-being, opportunities to connect
families and children with nature, tourism and economic growth related to
outdoor recreation. The public loves and wants to stay connected with its
national parks, national forests and public lands.
The U.S. Forest Service alone is responsible for over 158,000
miles of trails throughout 155 national forests and grasslands. Yet in 2012, the Forest Service was
able to maintain only 37 percent of its trails. Only one-quarter of its trail
miles meet agency standards for public use. Government resources to maintain
trails have shrunk while public demand for trails in our national parks and
forests continues to climb. The “backlog” in trail maintenance only grows worse
each year. Despite increased volunteer efforts by Back Country Horsemen and
others, our nation’s public lands are becoming increasingly inaccessible. 
The Crisis:


Deteriorating and often impassible trail conditions across the
country


Backlog in trail maintenance and resultant trail closures


Lack of awareness among elected officials about the benefits of
public trails


Diminishing agency budgets for outdoor recreation


Increasing demand for volunteer organizations like BCHA
to maintain more trail miles each year


In 2013, the Government Accountability Office estimated that nearly
a quarter of Forest Service trail maintenance comes from state funding, other
federal and non-federal sources, and volunteers and partners like BCHA. This
need is expected to grow as Congress continues to place low priority on public
lands funding.
Our Solutions:


Strengthening BCHA’s capacity as a leading voice among public land
and trail stewardship organizations


Demonstrating the wide range of institutions and organizations who
care about, and depend upon, trail systems that course throughout our public
lands


Amplifying the message and collaboration of Back Country Horsemen
across the country to support increasing demand for volunteers on the ground maintaining our trails


Sustaining volunteerism by engaging today’s youth as the next
generation of public land stewards


Advancing solutions to remove current barriers that prevent
qualified volunteers from maintaining trails


Demonstrating the need for Congress to augment and support trail
programs of our federal agency partners


How You Can Be Part of the SolutionCurrently, nearly 100% of BCHA's funding is derived from two sources—from membership dues of and the generous contributions of our volunteer members. We have reached a tipping point when we can ask only so much more from our volunteers, who consistently donate more time and energy year after year. We are now asking for you to partner with us and our amazing volunteer members. We seek assistance from corporate sponsors, philanthropic foundations, and you through crowd-sourcing to share the responsibility for keeping trails open for everyone. Whether or not you've ever set foot on a trail, we know you want to ensure your kids or grandkids will have the opportunity. Please browse our incentives below and consider contributing today.

<span style=""color: #009900;""><strong><br/><br/>How does it work?</strong></span>
<br/>A very small amount of pro-degradant additive is put into the manufacturing process. This breaks the molecular chains in the polymer, and at the end of its useful life the product falls apart.

<br/>When the material has reached the fragmentation stage it is no longer a plastic, and is ""biodegradable"" in the same way as nature's wastes such as straw and twigs.

<p>Choose Rain has replaced the EVIL perception of bottled water with PURE rainwater in a guilt free, eco-friendly bio-D bottle.  </p><p>Creativity, transparency and
authenticity are the keys to success for many very successful crowd funding
campaigns.  The next two campaigns are outstanding examples.<i>  The Kickstarter ""Potato

humor, social media and a viral campaign.  <i>The Indiegogo ""Flow Hive"" campaign</i>
asked for just $70,000 and raised over $12 million.  Flow Hive developed <b><i>the better mousetrap</i></b> for

</div></div>","Not All Bottled
Water is EVIL,  Choose Rain has built a better mousetrap!""Choose
Rain's proprietary process presents the most significant innovation in bottled
water since the 1970's when bottled water was first introduced in plastic
bottles.” 
Choose Rain has replaced the EVIL perception of bottled water with PURE rainwater in a guilt free, eco-friendly bio-D bottle.  Creativity, transparency and
authenticity are the keys to success for many very successful crowd funding
campaigns.  The next two campaigns are outstanding examples.  The Kickstarter ""Potato
Salad"" campaign, asked for $10 and raised $55,492 due to
humor, social media and a viral campaign.  The Indiegogo ""Flow Hive"" campaign
asked for just $70,000 and raised over $12 million.  Flow Hive developed the better mousetrap for
wanna-be bee keepers and unlocked a previously untapped market – making the
essential practice of bee keeping simple. What a concept!  Hats off to them all. 

So in the true tradition of authentic,
transparent and innovative campaigns, we bring you Choose Rain – the evolution of bottled
water: removing the negatives and replacing them with positives.              

Choose Rain is a company
that harvests rainwater, purifies it naturally, pours it into bio-D bottles and distributes it to the marketplace where you can now enjoy pure, clean,
eco-friendly bottled water.

Launched on April 22, 2015, to honor Earth Day, our campaign will
create orders for our sustainable bottled water to help us gear up
production to meet global demand.  In the three years since we first introduced Choose Rain, we have discovered a very real need for our unique water in our bio-D bottle.  We are now ready to take Choose Rain to the world market. 
Our research shows us that people love Choose Rain!  They love the way the water tastes, the way the
bottle looks and they simply love the fact that both are genuinely eco-friendly: thus making Choose Rain a unique product among bottled waters.  
Our Campaign will provide the funds to take several steps forward on our
quest to secure a larger rainwater catchment and bottling facility in Central
Florida.  Whether we raise our $50,000 target
goal or $500,000 or even $5,000,000, every dollar will get us closer to providing
pure rainwater for human consumption that is safe, environmentally conscious,
and easy to access anywhere on earth.
Check out the rest of our campaign to find out how we take the rain from
the heavens and turn it into water you can drink safely and conscientiously. 

THE STORY 

The CEO of Choose Rain built a home in
Florida where rainwater is his only source of water, free from harsh chemicals
and over processing.  He decided to take his philosophy to the next level and
provide the same fresh experience for people everywhere.                              Memories of running around as a child catching rainwater on your tongue was the inspiration behind Choose
Rain. By drinking our bottled water, it is the closest you will ever get to that
childhood experience. Our water is safe for everyone to drink, just like catching
rain straight from the skies!  Coming
soon from a cloud near you! Water
Crisis!  Over filled landfills and
polluted waterways!  Unhealthy
water!                                                                                Rainwater gives aquifers a reprieve, Choose Rain!                                                   Our bio-D bottle gives landfills a reprieve, Choose Rain!                      Why is Choose Rain's bottled rainwater a better mousetrap?  We all know that traditional bottled water, the old mousetrap, is bad for the environment.  It's bad for the aquifer.  It's bad for landfills.  For nearly 50 years, since the first plastic bottles appeared, people across the globe now purchase 200 billion bottles of water a year in the name of convenience.  We know we shouldn't drink bottled water but we do anyway.  We call it ""guilty sustenance"".  This is all anyone had available until Choose Rain changed the playing field to offer a superior, ""guilt-free"", bottled water experience. Water Crisis! Over filled landfills and polluted waterways!  Unhealthy water!  Choose Rain™ is a revolutionary alternative to the bottled water currently available on the market.  Captured before it hits the ground, our rainwater is still fresh, sweet and pure - no ground pollution!  Our one of a kind purification process avoids the use of Chlorine and other harmful chemicals.  Once discarded, our unique, eco-friendly, bio-D plastic bottles are manufactured to dissolve more quickly in a typical landfill leaving no harmful by-products in the soil.  Of course our bottles are recyclable, in you choose.          

    The proof is in our process.  Choose Rain harvests rainwater before
it is contaminated.  We process it
naturally using ozone, ultra-violet light, micro-filtration and
other techniques.  Our bio-D bottle that goes away in a landfill up to 100 times faster than
traditional plastic bottles. Choose Rain's proprietary system, our better mousetrap, offers an ultra-premium bottled water to the vast number of the people who do care about their health, the water crisis and the proliferation of plastic in our oceans, streams, lakes and landfills. 
We are ready to revolutionize the bottled
water industry to foster in a new ecological beginning for bottled water!
With
a very attractive bottle and label, Choose Rain will stand out on the store
shelf.  We start out cleaner than most
end up.  We feel that Choose Rain simply
tastes better and is better for you.  The
bio-D bottle is just icing on the cake.  Our elegant look and wide mouthed bottle will
compete quite favorably with the higher priced waters like Evian, FIJI, VOSS
and Smartwater.
One of our best endorsements oddly comes from the label on Coke's Glaceau Smart Water which
reads.  ""Is
it just us or do clouds get a bad rap? While we admit they're not as great to
have around on a beach day as say the sun. 
Clouds are unsung heroes because they contain natures purest source of
water.  Meanwhile spring water comes
from the ground and contains random stuff and whatever else the animals that
swim in it leave behind.  That's why we
copied our white puffy friends by creating Smart Water.  It's vapor distilled so it is in its purest
original state, but we don't stop there.  We one-up the clouds by adding
electrolytes.  It's a difference you can
taste, unless of course you have no taste buds, then you're on your own"". We couldn't
have said it better ourselves.  We
don't have to ""one-up"" the clouds, we are the clouds' pure rainwater
in a eco-friendly bottle!

<p><b>1.<span> 
</span></b><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>To dream
means to be bold, courageous, fearless, sensible and above all, to believe in
yourself. The difference between having a dream and to make this dream come true
depends on the strength of your spirit - the belief in yourself, how much you
want to achieve this dream, and what effort would you invest to make it happen.
This divine Strength of the spirit drives us to new horizons, as well as all
mankind.</p>
<p>I am
conducting an experiment with myself for several years and here I will tell you
briefly about it. I do not claim that everything I do is right and that I have
to find supporters. Quite to the contrary, I am open to criticism and
discussions, because this way we are getting closer to the truth. The world is
changing every day, and we ourselves are changing and nothing can be extreme in
terms of statements and actions. It is important for a person to have the
correct information and to take decision on his own.</p>
<p>At the
beginning of 2012, I had started the realization of Subproject 1, which
envisages climbing the highest summits of the seven continents on our planet
without consumption of food of animal origin - as a vegan. This is related with
a study of the body and the strength of spirit, which, in turn, in order to
achieve the goal is related to achieving inner peace, a healthy and balanced diet,
reasonable sports and physical activity and culture, and as a whole, a natural way
of life.</p>
<p>How could a
man, who had never played sports and had no coaches, leaders, teachers,
managers and experience in the mountains, achieve the desired results.</p>
<p>In addition to
the highest continental summits and the highest summits on the planet, I am
also climbing many other summits in Bulgaria and abroad and I am also participating
in other sports activities in order to develop and improve my physical and
mental condition and to acquire the necessary skills and experience.</p>
<p><b><span>2.<span>  </span></span></b><b>Why Veganism?</b></p>
<p>In the
beginning of 2012, I switched to a vegan diet by excluding the 
consumption of
food of animal origin. I was a vegetarian for the previous six years but
 I was
looking for a change not only in my diet but also in my lifestyle, a 
change in
my thinking, in my actions, in my morals, in my behavior, as well as for
 a
change in my physical body.Everything
was subordinated to my study on excluding the consumption of food of 
animal
origin from my diet and exploring my body and my mentality. I believe
experimenting is needed in order to find the optimal solution.I am a 
vegan for almost four years and I still cannot get to thorough
conclusions, but I dare say that for the time being I feel very well and
 at
this stage I do not intend to change my diet regime. I only explore new 
plant
foods as well as their combinations.On the other hand, some doctors are 
sharing the opinion that at the moment
my organism is consuming the reserves of my body and after the 5th or 
the 6th
year as a vegan, my organism will suffer from health complications.I 
respect the opinion of the doctors, but for me it is far more important
to test how my organism will function in the future. Of course, as I 
already said,
this is an experiment and something can be changed at all times, if 
necessary.
I eat what I find delicious and what I feel like eating.The most 
important is to know if this diet regime is suitable for us
people, because in this way we will be able to significantly lower or 
even
discontinue the consumption of animals, which is associated not only to 
many
advantages and benefits for the human health, but also to protecting the
 planet
from global pollution and finding a way to feed the increasingly growing
population of people on planet Earth.The agricultural land on which we 
grow our food and the food for the
animals we eat, is limited and although new farmland is developed in 
some
areas, in other areas this land is urbanized and its status is changed 
mostly
to industrial and residential use.Either way, the agricultural land 
cannot grow indefinitely, it is limited.
But the population can grow as long as there is something to eat. The 
major
share of the cultivated agricultural land and the pasturelands are 
intended for
animal feed. If we reduce the consumption of meat and animal products, 
there
will be more space for plant food for humans and thus the world's 
population
can grow twice as much. Another very important fact is that the 
industrial animal breeding is a
very big polluter on the planet. The destruction of the ozone layer is 
mainly due
to the methane, which is excreted by the digestive system of the 
animals.
According to the United Nations data, the share of the greenhouse gases 
as a
result of animal breeding is about 50%.Over 70 billion animals are bred 
and eaten on the planet each year, and they
are consuming 2/3 of drinking water and contributing to the water 
pollution and
the entire planet. Also, in order to meet the needs of the market for 
meat and
animal products, more forests and jungles are transformed into pastures 
or used
for the needs of animal breeding.This industry has become the largest 
consumer of drinking water and user of
natural resources. The extermination and exploitation of animals by 
humans is
another important topic, which I do not want to discuss at present. This
 planet
is a haven for all animal species and humans and everyone should have an
 equal
chance to live on it without being grown for human consumption. For me, 
it is
very important that everyone can eat according to their internal 
beliefs,
morals and values.</p>
<p>To seek the
limits of the human capabilities and the limits of the vegan which are directly
related to the Strength of spirit and belief in the unlimited possibilities, are
my top priority. Everything must happen first in the head and then to believe
in it, and after that to apply it in practice.</p>
<p>If this vegan
diet is suitable for the most challenging activity for the mind and body
 - high
altitude alpinism, it means that people can easily live only plant 
food.Even reducing only the consumption of meat, fish, milk, cheese and 
eggs in
half will lead to a reduction in half of the harmful carbon emissions 
from
animal breeding on the planet, as well as half of the land used for 
growing
food for the animals, can be planted with forests or used for growing 
plant
foods for humans.</p>
<p>3.<span>  </span><b>Why the mountain</b><b>?</b></p>
<p>For me, the
mountain is something very special, where I have found everything I needed.
There, I feel free, balanced, in comfort with myself and I can reflect on
everything that excites me and where I can find answers to the questions that I
am asking myself.I believe
that the mountain helps not only to me to feel better, to fill me up with
energy and to teach me, but it also helps to many other people. So, I can only
recommend it to those who have not touched the magic of the mountain yet, and
are willing to do so, to just do it.Trekking, a small hike... if they like it, to continue. If it is not their
place, just to find their place. Everyone has its place on the planet where he feels
well balanced and in harmony with himself and the surroundings.</p>
<p>The mountain
helps me to discover very fine details of my character, and to reflect on life
and its patterns. I cherish Bulgaria and the nature and I had especially
returned to live in our homeland.</p>
<p>We have a
unique planet, which is a wonderful place for the existence of our human
 race.
Unfortunately, with the globalization and industrialization, we are 
destroying more
and more the nature and especially the ecosystems by building vast and 
numerous
animal breeding farms. Every day plant and animal species are 
disappearing.It hurts me for this planet and I want our children, 
grandchildren and
great-grandchildren to have the same chance as me to enjoy the beauty 
and
inspiration of our nature, to share what I see now with my eyes, smell 
with my
nose, feel with my skin and breathe with my lungs.Just let us all try to
 live as environmentally friendly as we can, and to
try to protect our planet from pollution with basic things. No man can 
call
himself and to think about himself as environmentalist while consuming 
food of
animal origin at the same time.</p>
<p>We have to
go back to Mother Nature. She teaches us many things and gives us answers to
the questions. We need to protect the nature because we will lose it.</p>
<p>Although I
got involved in alpinism and mountain sports relatively soon, I have devoted
myself entirely to the mountain and the nature.</p>
<p>4.<span>  </span><b>Project goals</b></p>
<p>My goal is
to show to more people that there is another way of life besides the most
common one. That, if a man who had never done sports before could cope with one
of the biggest challenges – high altitude alpinism, it means that we can live a
full life without animal products. Behind all this we can see the Strength of spirit
and the unlimited human capabilities.</p>
<p><b>The
key goal of this project is to test whether the lack of animal food in the diet
of a human would adversely affect his physical and mental qualities.</b><b>On the contrary, to check
whether without the consumption of food of animal origin, the human organism can
function well and can achieve higher physical and mental performance. </b></p>
<p><b>Another goal
of the project is to show that there are no impossible things and everything is
achievable if you believe in it and if you make the necessary effort for that.
To explore our own body and discover what is best for it while trying to fully
protect the environment and live in harmony with ourselves and the nature. To
believe in ourselves and in the strength of our capabilities.</b></p>
<p>This is whyI started climbing all the highest continental summits of the planet as
well as all summits higher than eight thousand meters without the consumption
of food of animal origin from a man who has never been an athlete and has not
practiced any sports.</p>
<p><b>5.<span> 
</span></b><b>Interim results:</b></p>
<p>With the
climbing the Vinson Massif summit on 22 December 2014, six highest continental summits
were concurred – those of Africa, Europe, South America, Asia, Australia and
Oceania and Antarctica and reaching 6900 meters on Lenin summit, Pamirs for
less than two years. On 01.10.2015, I climbed Manaslu summit in the Himalayas,
as a first expedition of Subproject 2.</p>
<p>I dare say
that I feel much better physically and mentally and I continue with the vegan
diet. Every few months I am going through medical examination and giving blood
samples, in order to monitor the status of major health indicators.</p>
<p>For 2014 and
2015 I have made presentations in various Bulgarian towns - Sliven, Rousse,
Plovdiv, Sofia, Varna, Mezdra, Vratsa, Kozloduy and others. My example
continues to attract young people who love the mountain and the healthy
lifestyle and all those dreamers who believe in themselves, and who want to
find themselves, and through my example, I am clearly showing the realization
of the change to which they aspire.I do not want to impose my way of life to anyone, especially veganism. Let
everyone find for himself the right way of life for him. My message to all is
to find what makes them happy and in balance with themselves and the
environment. Any dream can come true, if you believe in it and you make the
necessary effort. I want to show that there are no impossible things.
Everything is possible and let everyone believe in their dreams and the strength
of their spirit.</p>
<p>But let us
reflect on animal breeding, what it gives us and what it takes from us. For me
it is important that all people have information about the food, especially of
animal origin, and what are the results from its production. How the animal
food got to the table and what did it cause. Then everyone can decide for
themselves what to eat and how to live on this planet.</p><p>6.<span>  </span><b>Subprojects:</b></p>

<p>All of the 14 eight-thousanders are located in Asia in
the Himalayas and the Karakorum. </p>
<p><b>Start of the project</b>: 01.09.2015.</p>
<p><b>End of the project</b>: 31.12.2020.</p>
<p><b>Implementation of the project by</b>: Dr.  Atanas Skatov was born on 11.03.1978 in the
town of Sliven. Master of Plant Protection at the Agricultural University -
Plovdiv and Doctor of the Humboldt University Berlin, Germany. Dr.  Atanas Skatov did not consume meat since
January 2007, and fish since 6 December 2009. In early 2012, he ceased the
consumption of animal food. Until the summer of 2010, Atanas Skatov carried
almost no physical activity, the last time he had been involved in sports was during
his school years, 1990-1996.</p>
<p><b>History of the
climbing of the 14 highest peaks of our planet:</b></p>
<p>The first person to climb all 14 eight-thousanders was
Reinhold Messner, who completed this project in 1988. It took him 18 years to
climb all of the 14 summits without the use of artificial oxygen. For those 27
years, until now, a total of 34 people managed to set foot on all of the14 summits,
among which there are three women. Of those 34 people, 14 did not use
artificial oxygen when climbing.The fastest climbing of the 14 summits up to now is
done for eight years. Very good physical and mental preparation is needed for
climbing each of these summits, as well as a fee for the summit and inclusion
in an expedition. Around USD 230 000 is needed for climbing all the summits,
provided that they are climbed from the first attempt, which has not happened
to any alpinist, who had managed to finish the project.</p>
<p><b>Goal of Subproject

results </b></p>
<p>On 01.10.2015, at 5.50 hours Nepalese time, Atanas Skatov managed to 
reach
successfully Mount Manaslu without using artificial oxygen. Mount 
Manaslu is
the eighth highest summit on the planet, 8165 m high in the Himalayas. 
This is
the first expedition from Subproject 2. Despite the difficulties and two
unsuccessful attempts just before reaching the summit, Atanas Skatov did
 not
give up and made a third attempt with only two days resting between the 
attempts.Having reached the summit at minus 25 degrees with the sunrise 
and climbing
all night, because there were 8 alpinists before him, he had to stay 50 
minutes
in one place, immediately below the very summit. After that he spent 
another 20
minutes in the photos and videos at the summit, Atanas Skatov decided to
 use
artificial oxygen after the summit, which he had brought for emergencies
 and
breathed about 40 minutes on the way down to an altitude of about 7600 
m. Thus,
Atanas Skatov became the first vegan in the world to climb the summit 
only with
consumption of plant food during the expedition and managed to climb the
 summit
without artificial oxygen consumption.</p>
<p><b>9</b>.<span>  </span><b>Findings and
Conclusion</b>.</p>
<p>If this diet proves to be healthy for us humans, it
could reduce the consumption of meat and animal products, which will lead to a
huge reduction in the pollution of our planet resulting from animal breeding
and production of food of animal origin in industrial quantities.Also, agricultural land will be released and can be
used for the production of plant food and thus could help in solving the
problem with the world hunger and the safe increase in the population on our
planet. On the other hand, this will stop the destruction of forests and
jungles, which now takes place in order to provide for the needs of animal
breeding and will reduce the consumption of drinking water supplies.Planting new forests and jungles could begin on the
released agricultural land. The experiment is of great importance to all mankind
and the preservation of the nature on our planet.</p>
<p>The experiment will continue for an indefinite period
of time. </p>
<p>Financial support is needed in order to conduct this
experiment.</p>

заключение</p><br/><p><b>1.<span> 
</span></b><b>Увод</b></p>
<p>Да мечтаеш означава да бъдеш дързък,
смел, безстрашен, разумен и най-​вече да вярваш в себе си. Разликата от това да
имаш мечта и това да сбъднеш тази мечта зависи от силата на духът ти– вярата в
теб, колко силно искаш да постигнеш тази мечта и какъв труд би положил за да се
осъществи. Тази божествена Сила на духът движи нас към нови хоризонти, както и
цялото човечество.</p>
<p>От няколко години провеждам един
експеримент с мен и тук ще Ви разкажа на кратко за него. Нямам претенции, че
всичко което правя е правилно и трябва да намеря поддръжници. Дори напротив,
радвам се на критики и дискусии, понеже тогава се доближаваме по-​близо до
истината. Света се променя всеки ден, както и ние самите се променяме и нищо не
може да бъде крайно като изказване и действия.Важно е човек да има правилната
информация и сам да вземе решение.</p>
<p>В началото на 2012 година започнах
реализиране на подпроект 1, който предвижда изкачване на най-​високите върхове
на седемте континента на нашата планета без консумация на храна от животински
произход– като веган. Това е свързано с изследване на тялото и силата на духът,
който от своя страна за постигане на целта е свързан с постигане на вътрешен
мир, пълноценно и балансирано хранене, разумна спортно-​физическа активност и
култура и като цяло природосъобразен начин на живот.</p>
<p>Как може човек, който никога не е
спортувал и няма треньори, водачи, учители, мениджъри и опит в планината, да
постигне желаните резултати.</p>
<p>Освен континенталните първенции най-високите върхове на планетата,
изкачвам и много други върхове в България и чужбина, взимам участие и в други
спортни активности за усъвършенстване и подобряване на физическото си и
психическото си състояние и придобиване на необходими умения и опит.</p>
<p><b><span>2.<span>  </span></span></b><b>Защо веганство?</b></p>
<p>Преминах на 1 януари 2012г на
вегански режим на хранене без консумация на храна от животински произход. Бях 6
години преди това вегетарианец, но търсих някаква промяна не само в режима си
на хранене, а и промяна в начина си на живот, промяна в мисленето си, в
действията си, в морала си, в поведението си, както и промяна на физическото си
тяло. Всичко бе подчинено на изследването да преустановя консумацията на храна
от животински произход и да изследвам тялото си и психиката си. Според мен
трябва да се експериментира, за да се намери оптималното решение. Вече почти 4
години съм веган и не мога все още да направя задълбочени изводи, но смея да
твърдя, че за сега се чувствам много добре и на този етап нямам намерение да
променям режима си на хранене. Единствено се запознавам с нови растителни храни,
както и комбинации между тях. От друга страна някои лекари са на мнение че, в
момента организма ми консумира запасите в тялото ми и след 5-​тата или 6- ​тата
година като веган, в организма ми ще настъпят усложнения в здравословното ми
състояние. Уважавам мнението на лекарите, но за мен е много по-​важно сам да
проверя как ще функционира организма ми за напред. Разбира се, както вече
казах, всичко това е един експеримент и винаги може да се промени нещо, ако се
наложи. Аз се храня с това което ми е вкусно и ми се яде. Най-​важно е да
разбера дали този режим на хранене е подходящ за нас хората, защото по този
начин ще можем да намалим значително и дори преустановим консумацията на
животни, което е свързано не само с много предимства и ползи за здравето на
човека, но тук става въпрос да предпазим планетата от глобално замърсяване и
намиране на изход с изхранването на все по-силно увеличаващата се популация от хора
на планетата Земя. Селскостопанските площи, върху които отглеждаме нашата храна
и тази на животните с които се храним, са ограничени и въпреки че се създават
нови селскостопански площи в някои райони, то в други тези площи се урбанизират
и преминават в друг статут на ползване, най-​вече промишлен и жилищен. Така или
иначе селскостопанските площи не могат да нарастват безкрайно, ограничени са.
Населението обаче може да нараства докато има с какво да се изхранва.
По-​голямата част от обработваемите селскостопански площи и пасища са за храна
на животните. Ако се намали консумацията на месо и животинска продукция, ще има
много повече площи за растителна храна за хората и така населението на земята
може да нараства двойно повече. Другият много важен факт е, че промишленото гледане на животни е много голям
замърсител на планетата. Разрушаването на озоновият слой се дължи най-вече на
метана, който се отделя от храносмилателната система на животните. По данни на
ООН дела на парниковите газове при отглеждането на животни е около 50%. На
планета се отглеждат и изяждат годишно над 70 милиарда животни, които консумират
2/3 от
питейната вода и допринасят за замърсяване на водите и цялата планета. Също
така за да се задоволи пазара на месо и животински продукти все повече гори и
джунгли се превръщат в пасища или се използват за нуждите на животновъдството.
Този отрасъл се превръща в най-големият консуматор на питейна вода и използване
на природните ресурси. Изтребването и експлоатирането на животните от човека е
друга важна тема, която в момента не искам да коментирам. Тази планета е убежище
за всички животински видове и човека и всеки трябва да има равен шанс да живее
на нея без да бъде отглеждан за консумация от човека. За мен е много важно
всеки да се храни според вътрешните си убеждения, морал и ценностна система. </p>
<p>Да търся границите на човешките
възможности и границите на вегана, които са пряко свързани със Силата на духът
и вярата в неограничените възможности, са мой основен приоритет. Всичко първо
трябва да се случи в главата и да повярваме в него и след това да го приложим и
на практика.</p>
<p>Ако този режим на хранене като веган е подходящ за
най-натоварващата тялото и психиката дейност- височинният алпинизъм, значи може
спокойно хората да живеят само с растителна храна. Дори само намаляването на
консумацията на месо, риба, мляко, сирене и яйца на половина, ще доведе до
намаляване на половина на вредният въглероден отпечатък от животновъдството
върху планетата, както и половината площи за отглеждане на храна за животните,
може да бъдат залесени с гори или използвани за отглеждане на растителна храна
за човека.</p>
<p>3.<span>  </span><b>Защо планината?</b></p>
<p>За мен планината е нещо много
специално, където открих всичко от което имам нужда. Там се чувствам свободен,
балансиран, в комфорт със себе си и мога да размишлявам върху всичко, което ме
вълнува и да намеря отговори на въпросите, които си задавам. Вярвам, че не само
на мен планината помага да се чувствам добре, да ме зарежда с енергия и да ме
учи, а и на много други хора. Затова мога само да препоръчам на тези които още
не са се докоснали до магията на планината, а имат желание, просто да го
направят. Един поход, малък преход.…ако им хареса да продължат. Ако не е
тяхното място, просто да намерят своето място. Всеки има свое място на
планетата, където се чувства добре, балансиран и в хармония със себе си и
заобграждащата го среда.</p>
<p>Планината ми помага да открия много фини детайли от
моя характер, както и да размишлявам върху живота и неговите закономерности. Обичам
много България и природата и специално се завърнах да живея в нашата родина.</p>
<p>Имаме уникална планета, която е прекрасно място за
съществуване на нашата човешка раса. За съжаление с глобализирането и
индустриализацията все повече унищожаваме природата и най-​вече екосистемите с
огромните и многобройни ферми за отглеждане на животни. Всеки ден изчезват
растителни и животински видове. Боли ме за тази планета и искам това, което аз
виждам сега с очите си, мириша с носа си, чувствам с кожата си и дишам с
дробовете си, да могат и нашите деца, внуци и правнуци да имат същият шанс и те
да се насладят на красотата и вдъхновението на нашата природа. Просто нека
всички се опитаме да живеем колкото може природосъобразно и се опитваме с
елементарни неща да предпазваме нашата планета от замърсяване. Не може човек да
се нарича и да се мисли за природо-защитник и да консумира храна от животински
произход. </p>
<p>Трябва да се върнем отново към Майката-природа. Тя ни
учи на много неща и ни дава отговори на въпросите. Трябва да пазим природата,
защото ще я загубим.</p>
<p>Въпреки, че
от сравнително скоро се занимавам с алпинизъм и спортове в планината, съм се
отдал изцяло на планината и природата.</p>
<p>4.<span>  </span><b>Цели на проекта</b></p>
<p>Целта ми е да покажа на повече хора, че има и друг
начин на живот освен най-​разпространения. Че след като човек, който никога не
е спортувал преди, може да се справи с едно от най-​големите натоварвания –
височинния алпинизъм, значи и без животински продукти се живее пълноценно. Зад
всичко това прозира Силата на духа и неограничените човешки възможности.</p>
<p><b>Основната цел на настоящия проект е, да се
провери дали липсата на животинска храна в менюто на човека ще се отрази
неблагоприятно на неговите физически и психически качества. Напротив, да се
провери дали без консумация на храна с животински произход, човешкият организъм
функционира добре и може да постигне високи физически и психически резултати.</b></p>
<p><b>Друга цел на проекта е, да се покаже че няма
невъзможни неща и всичко е постижимо, ако вярваш в него и положиш необходимият
труд за това. Да изследваме собственото си тяло и да открием кое е най-​добре
за него, като се опитаме максимално да опазваме околната среда и да живеем в
хармония със себе си и природата. Да вярваме в себе си и в силата на нашите
възможности.</b></p>
<p>Затова предприех изкачване на всички континентални
първенци на планетата, както и на всички върхове над осем хиляди метра без консумация
на храна от животински произход от човек, който никога не е бил спортист и не е
тренирал спортове.</p>
<p><b>5.<span>  </span></b><b>Временни резултати:</b></p>
<p>С изкачването на връх Винсън Масив
на 22 декември 2014г са преодолени 6 континентални първенци– на Африка, Европа,
Южна Америка, Азия, Австралия и Океания и на Антарктида и достигане на 6900м на
връг Ленин, Памир за по-​малко от 2 години. На 01.10.2015г. изкачих връх
Манаслу в Хималаите, като първа експедиция от подпроект 2.</p>
<p>Смея да твърдя, че се чувствам много добре физически и
психически и  продължавам да съм с веган
режим на хранене. През няколко месеца провеждам и медицински прегледи и давам
кръвни проби, където се следят нормите на важни за здравето показатели. </p>
<p>За 2014 и 2015 година съм направил презентации в
различни градове на България-Сливен, Русе, Пловдив, София, Варна, Мездра,
Враца, Козлодуй и други. Моят пример продължава да увлича младите, хора,
обичащи планината и здравословния начин на живот и всички тези мечтатели, които
вярват в себе си, искат да намерят себе си и чрез моя пример аз показвам
нагледно реализирането на промяната към която те се стремят. Не искам да
налагам на никой моя начин на живот, особено веганството. Нека всеки открие сам
за себе си правилният начин за него на живот. Моето послание към всички е да
открият какво ги прави щастливи и в баланс със себе си и околната среда. Всяка
мечта може да бъде сбъдната, ако вярваш в нея и положиш необходимият труд.
Искам да покажа, че невъзможни неща няма. Всичко е възможно и нека всеки вярва
в мечтите си и силата на духът си.</p>
<p>Нека обаче се замислим върху животновъдството, какво
ни дава и какво ни отнема. За мен е важно всички хора да имат информация за
храната, особено от животински произход и до какво води нейното производство. Как
е стигнала животинската храна до трапезата и какво е предизвикала. Тогава вече
може всеки сам да реши с какво да се храни и как да живее на тази планета.</p>

<p><b>Край на
проекта</b>: 31.12.2020г.</p>
<p><b>Изпълнител
на проекта</b>: д-​р Атанас Скатов, роден на 11.03.1978г. в гр. Сливен.
Магистър по Растителна защита на Аграрен университет — Пловдив и доктор на
Хумболдт университет Берлин, Германия. Д-​р Атанас Скатов не консумира месо от
януари 2007г, а риба от декември 2009г. В началото на 2012
преустановява консумацията на животинска храна. До лятото на 2010г. Атанас Скатов не извършва почти никаква физическа
активност, като последно се е занимавал със спорт в ученическите си години 1990-1996г.</p>
<p><b>История на изкачването на 14-те най-високи върха на
нашата планета:</b></p>
<p>Първия човек,
осъществил този проект е Райнхолд Меснер през 1988г. Били са му нужни 18
 години,
за да изкачи всичките 14 върха без използване на изкуствен кислород. За 
тези 27
години успяват общо 34 човека към днешна дата да стъпят на всичките 14 
върха,
между които има и 3 жени. От тези 34 човека 14 не са използвали 
изкуствен
кислород при изкачванията. Най-бързото изкачване на 14-те върха до 
момента е осъществено
за 8 години. За изкачване на всеки един от тези върхове е нужна много 
добра
физическа и психическа подготовка, както и заплащане на такса за върха и
 включване в експедиция. За изкачване на всичките върхове
са нужни около 230 000 долара, при положение че бъдат изкачвани от първи
опит, което досега не се е случило с нито един алпинист, успял да 
завърши
проекта си.</p>
<p><b>Цели на подпроект 2: </b></p>

резултати на подпроект 2</b></p>
<p>На 01.10.2015г, в 5.50 часа непалско
време Атанас Скатов успява успешно да достигне връх Манаслу без да използва
изкуствен кислород. Връх Манаслу е осмият по височина връх на планетата-висок 8165м
в Хималаите, като това е първата експедиция от подпроект 2. Въпреки трудностите
и два неуспешни опити непосредствено преди достигане върха, Атанас Скатов не се
отказва и прави трети опит, като между отделните опити е почивал само 2 дни.
След като достига върха при минус 25 градуса с изгрева на слънцето и цяла нощ
катерене, преди него има 8 алпиниста и се налага да остане 50 минути на едно
място непосредствено под самия връх. След това прекарва още 20 минути в снимки
и видео на върха, Атанас Скатов решава след върха да ползва изкуствен кислород,
който носи за спешен случай и диша около 40 минути на слизане до височина около
7600м. Така Атанас Скатов става първия веган в света, който изкачва върха само
с консумация на растителна храна и по време на експедицията и успява до самият
връх да се изкачи без консумация на изкуствен кислород.</p>
<p>9.<span> 
</span><b>Изводи и
заключение</b>.</p>
<p>Ако този режим
на хранене се докаже като здравословен за нас хората, би могло да се  намали консумацията на месо и животинска
продукция, което ще доведе до огромно намаляване на замърсяването на нашата
планета в резултат на отглеждането на животни и производството на храна от
животински произход в промишлени количества. Също така ще се освободят
селскостопански площи, които могат да бъдат използвани за производство на
растителна храна и така би могло да се помогне при решаването на проблема със
световния глад и спокойно увеличаване на населението на нашата планета. От
друга страна ще се спре изсичането на горите и джунглите, което сега се прави за
нуждите на животновъдството, както и ще се намали консумацията на питейни
запаси от вода. На освободените селскостопански площи може да започне засаждане
на нови гори и джунгли. Експериментът е
с огромно значение за цялото човечество и за запазването на природата на нашата
планета.</p>
<p>Експериментът
продължава за неограничен период от време. </p>
<p>За да се проведе
този експеримент е нужна финансова подкрепа.</p>

Findings and Conclusion
  
1. 
Introduction
To dream
means to be bold, courageous, fearless, sensible and above all, to believe in
yourself. The difference between having a dream and to make this dream come true
depends on the strength of your spirit - the belief in yourself, how much you
want to achieve this dream, and what effort would you invest to make it happen.
This divine Strength of the spirit drives us to new horizons, as well as all
mankind.
I am
conducting an experiment with myself for several years and here I will tell you
briefly about it. I do not claim that everything I do is right and that I have
to find supporters. Quite to the contrary, I am open to criticism and
discussions, because this way we are getting closer to the truth. The world is
changing every day, and we ourselves are changing and nothing can be extreme in
terms of statements and actions. It is important for a person to have the
correct information and to take decision on his own.
At the
beginning of 2012, I had started the realization of Subproject 1, which
envisages climbing the highest summits of the seven continents on our planet
without consumption of food of animal origin - as a vegan. This is related with
a study of the body and the strength of spirit, which, in turn, in order to
achieve the goal is related to achieving inner peace, a healthy and balanced diet,
reasonable sports and physical activity and culture, and as a whole, a natural way
of life.
How could a
man, who had never played sports and had no coaches, leaders, teachers,
managers and experience in the mountains, achieve the desired results.
In addition to
the highest continental summits and the highest summits on the planet, I am
also climbing many other summits in Bulgaria and abroad and I am also participating
in other sports activities in order to develop and improve my physical and
mental condition and to acquire the necessary skills and experience.
2.  Why Veganism?
In the
beginning of 2012, I switched to a vegan diet by excluding the 
consumption of
food of animal origin. I was a vegetarian for the previous six years but
 I was
looking for a change not only in my diet but also in my lifestyle, a 
change in
my thinking, in my actions, in my morals, in my behavior, as well as for
 a
change in my physical body.Everything
was subordinated to my study on excluding the consumption of food of 
animal
origin from my diet and exploring my body and my mentality. I believe
experimenting is needed in order to find the optimal solution.I am a 
vegan for almost four years and I still cannot get to thorough
conclusions, but I dare say that for the time being I feel very well and
 at
this stage I do not intend to change my diet regime. I only explore new 
plant
foods as well as their combinations.On the other hand, some doctors are 
sharing the opinion that at the moment
my organism is consuming the reserves of my body and after the 5th or 
the 6th
year as a vegan, my organism will suffer from health complications.I 
respect the opinion of the doctors, but for me it is far more important
to test how my organism will function in the future. Of course, as I 
already said,
this is an experiment and something can be changed at all times, if 
necessary.
I eat what I find delicious and what I feel like eating.The most 
important is to know if this diet regime is suitable for us
people, because in this way we will be able to significantly lower or 
even
discontinue the consumption of animals, which is associated not only to 
many
advantages and benefits for the human health, but also to protecting the
 planet
from global pollution and finding a way to feed the increasingly growing
population of people on planet Earth.The agricultural land on which we 
grow our food and the food for the
animals we eat, is limited and although new farmland is developed in 
some
areas, in other areas this land is urbanized and its status is changed 
mostly
to industrial and residential use.Either way, the agricultural land 
cannot grow indefinitely, it is limited.
But the population can grow as long as there is something to eat. The 
major
share of the cultivated agricultural land and the pasturelands are 
intended for
animal feed. If we reduce the consumption of meat and animal products, 
there
will be more space for plant food for humans and thus the world's 
population
can grow twice as much. Another very important fact is that the 
industrial animal breeding is a
very big polluter on the planet. The destruction of the ozone layer is 
mainly due
to the methane, which is excreted by the digestive system of the 
animals.
According to the United Nations data, the share of the greenhouse gases 
as a
result of animal breeding is about 50%.Over 70 billion animals are bred 
and eaten on the planet each year, and they
are consuming 2/3 of drinking water and contributing to the water 
pollution and
the entire planet. Also, in order to meet the needs of the market for 
meat and
animal products, more forests and jungles are transformed into pastures 
or used
for the needs of animal breeding.This industry has become the largest 
consumer of drinking water and user of
natural resources. The extermination and exploitation of animals by 
humans is
another important topic, which I do not want to discuss at present. This
 planet
is a haven for all animal species and humans and everyone should have an
 equal
chance to live on it without being grown for human consumption. For me, 
it is
very important that everyone can eat according to their internal 
beliefs,
morals and values.
To seek the
limits of the human capabilities and the limits of the vegan which are directly
related to the Strength of spirit and belief in the unlimited possibilities, are
my top priority. Everything must happen first in the head and then to believe
in it, and after that to apply it in practice.
If this vegan
diet is suitable for the most challenging activity for the mind and body
 - high
altitude alpinism, it means that people can easily live only plant 
food.Even reducing only the consumption of meat, fish, milk, cheese and 
eggs in
half will lead to a reduction in half of the harmful carbon emissions 
from
animal breeding on the planet, as well as half of the land used for 
growing
food for the animals, can be planted with forests or used for growing 
plant
foods for humans.
3.  Why the mountain?
For me, the
mountain is something very special, where I have found everything I needed.
There, I feel free, balanced, in comfort with myself and I can reflect on
everything that excites me and where I can find answers to the questions that I
am asking myself.I believe
that the mountain helps not only to me to feel better, to fill me up with
energy and to teach me, but it also helps to many other people. So, I can only
recommend it to those who have not touched the magic of the mountain yet, and
are willing to do so, to just do it.Trekking, a small hike... if they like it, to continue. If it is not their
place, just to find their place. Everyone has its place on the planet where he feels
well balanced and in harmony with himself and the surroundings.
The mountain
helps me to discover very fine details of my character, and to reflect on life
and its patterns. I cherish Bulgaria and the nature and I had especially
returned to live in our homeland.
We have a
unique planet, which is a wonderful place for the existence of our human
 race.
Unfortunately, with the globalization and industrialization, we are 
destroying more
and more the nature and especially the ecosystems by building vast and 
numerous
animal breeding farms. Every day plant and animal species are 
disappearing.It hurts me for this planet and I want our children, 
grandchildren and
great-grandchildren to have the same chance as me to enjoy the beauty 
and
inspiration of our nature, to share what I see now with my eyes, smell 
with my
nose, feel with my skin and breathe with my lungs.Just let us all try to
 live as environmentally friendly as we can, and to
try to protect our planet from pollution with basic things. No man can 
call
himself and to think about himself as environmentalist while consuming 
food of
animal origin at the same time.
We have to
go back to Mother Nature. She teaches us many things and gives us answers to
the questions. We need to protect the nature because we will lose it.
Although I
got involved in alpinism and mountain sports relatively soon, I have devoted
myself entirely to the mountain and the nature.
4.  Project goals
My goal is
to show to more people that there is another way of life besides the most
common one. That, if a man who had never done sports before could cope with one
of the biggest challenges – high altitude alpinism, it means that we can live a
full life without animal products. Behind all this we can see the Strength of spirit
and the unlimited human capabilities.
The
key goal of this project is to test whether the lack of animal food in the diet
of a human would adversely affect his physical and mental qualities.On the contrary, to check
whether without the consumption of food of animal origin, the human organism can
function well and can achieve higher physical and mental performance. 
Another goal
of the project is to show that there are no impossible things and everything is
achievable if you believe in it and if you make the necessary effort for that.
To explore our own body and discover what is best for it while trying to fully
protect the environment and live in harmony with ourselves and the nature. To
believe in ourselves and in the strength of our capabilities.
This is whyI started climbing all the highest continental summits of the planet as
well as all summits higher than eight thousand meters without the consumption
of food of animal origin from a man who has never been an athlete and has not
practiced any sports.
5. 
Interim results:
With the
climbing the Vinson Massif summit on 22 December 2014, six highest continental summits
were concurred – those of Africa, Europe, South America, Asia, Australia and
Oceania and Antarctica and reaching 6900 meters on Lenin summit, Pamirs for
less than two years. On 01.10.2015, I climbed Manaslu summit in the Himalayas,
as a first expedition of Subproject 2.
I dare say
that I feel much better physically and mentally and I continue with the vegan
diet. Every few months I am going through medical examination and giving blood
samples, in order to monitor the status of major health indicators.
For 2014 and
2015 I have made presentations in various Bulgarian towns - Sliven, Rousse,
Plovdiv, Sofia, Varna, Mezdra, Vratsa, Kozloduy and others. My example
continues to attract young people who love the mountain and the healthy
lifestyle and all those dreamers who believe in themselves, and who want to
find themselves, and through my example, I am clearly showing the realization
of the change to which they aspire.I do not want to impose my way of life to anyone, especially veganism. Let
everyone find for himself the right way of life for him. My message to all is
to find what makes them happy and in balance with themselves and the
environment. Any dream can come true, if you believe in it and you make the
necessary effort. I want to show that there are no impossible things.
Everything is possible and let everyone believe in their dreams and the strength
of their spirit.
But let us
reflect on animal breeding, what it gives us and what it takes from us. For me
it is important that all people have information about the food, especially of
animal origin, and what are the results from its production. How the animal
food got to the table and what did it cause. Then everyone can decide for
themselves what to eat and how to live on this planet.6.  Subprojects:

Start of the project: 01.09.2015.
End of the project: 31.12.2020.
Implementation of the project by: Dr.  Atanas Skatov was born on 11.03.1978 in the
town of Sliven. Master of Plant Protection at the Agricultural University -
Plovdiv and Doctor of the Humboldt University Berlin, Germany. Dr.  Atanas Skatov did not consume meat since
January 2007, and fish since 6 December 2009. In early 2012, he ceased the
consumption of animal food. Until the summer of 2010, Atanas Skatov carried
almost no physical activity, the last time he had been involved in sports was during
his school years, 1990-1996.
History of the
climbing of the 14 highest peaks of our planet:
The first person to climb all 14 eight-thousanders was
Reinhold Messner, who completed this project in 1988. It took him 18 years to
climb all of the 14 summits without the use of artificial oxygen. For those 27
years, until now, a total of 34 people managed to set foot on all of the14 summits,
among which there are three women. Of those 34 people, 14 did not use
artificial oxygen when climbing.The fastest climbing of the 14 summits up to now is
done for eight years. Very good physical and mental preparation is needed for
climbing each of these summits, as well as a fee for the summit and inclusion
in an expedition. Around USD 230 000 is needed for climbing all the summits,
provided that they are climbed from the first attempt, which has not happened
to any alpinist, who had managed to finish the project.
Goal of Subproject
2: 
1. 
Climbing of the
14 eight-thousanders by a vegan; (for the first time in the world)
2. 
Climbing 4
eight-thousanders in one season for 100 days; (for the first time in the world)3. 
Climbing the 14 eight-thousanders
for less than 6 years, or as quickly as possible by a vegan, to challenge the
body as much as possible. (for the first time in the world)
All of the identified goals have not been achieved so
far, even by a person with a common ""normal"" diet and professional
alpine training. 
7.

8.  Subproject 2 Interim
results 
On 01.10.2015, at 5.50 hours Nepalese time, Atanas Skatov managed to 
reach
successfully Mount Manaslu without using artificial oxygen. Mount 
Manaslu is
the eighth highest summit on the planet, 8165 m high in the Himalayas. 
This is
the first expedition from Subproject 2. Despite the difficulties and two
unsuccessful attempts just before reaching the summit, Atanas Skatov did
 not
give up and made a third attempt with only two days resting between the 
attempts.Having reached the summit at minus 25 degrees with the sunrise 
and climbing
all night, because there were 8 alpinists before him, he had to stay 50 
minutes
in one place, immediately below the very summit. After that he spent 
another 20
minutes in the photos and videos at the summit, Atanas Skatov decided to
 use
artificial oxygen after the summit, which he had brought for emergencies
 and
breathed about 40 minutes on the way down to an altitude of about 7600 
m. Thus,
Atanas Skatov became the first vegan in the world to climb the summit 
only with
consumption of plant food during the expedition and managed to climb the
 summit
without artificial oxygen consumption.
9.  Findings and
Conclusion.
If this diet proves to be healthy for us humans, it
could reduce the consumption of meat and animal products, which will lead to a
huge reduction in the pollution of our planet resulting from animal breeding
and production of food of animal origin in industrial quantities.Also, agricultural land will be released and can be
used for the production of plant food and thus could help in solving the
problem with the world hunger and the safe increase in the population on our
planet. On the other hand, this will stop the destruction of forests and
jungles, which now takes place in order to provide for the needs of animal
breeding and will reduce the consumption of drinking water supplies.Planting new forests and jungles could begin on the
released agricultural land. The experiment is of great importance to all mankind
and the preservation of the nature on our planet.
The experiment will continue for an indefinite period
of time. 
Financial support is needed in order to conduct this
experiment.

Увод
Да мечтаеш означава да бъдеш дързък,
смел, безстрашен, разумен и най-​вече да вярваш в себе си. Разликата от това да
имаш мечта и това да сбъднеш тази мечта зависи от силата на духът ти– вярата в
теб, колко силно искаш да постигнеш тази мечта и какъв труд би положил за да се
осъществи. Тази божествена Сила на духът движи нас към нови хоризонти, както и
цялото човечество.
От няколко години провеждам един
експеримент с мен и тук ще Ви разкажа на кратко за него. Нямам претенции, че
всичко което правя е правилно и трябва да намеря поддръжници. Дори напротив,
радвам се на критики и дискусии, понеже тогава се доближаваме по-​близо до
истината. Света се променя всеки ден, както и ние самите се променяме и нищо не
може да бъде крайно като изказване и действия.Важно е човек да има правилната
информация и сам да вземе решение.
В началото на 2012 година започнах
реализиране на подпроект 1, който предвижда изкачване на най-​високите върхове
на седемте континента на нашата планета без консумация на храна от животински
произход– като веган. Това е свързано с изследване на тялото и силата на духът,
който от своя страна за постигане на целта е свързан с постигане на вътрешен
мир, пълноценно и балансирано хранене, разумна спортно-​физическа активност и
култура и като цяло природосъобразен начин на живот.
Как може човек, който никога не е
спортувал и няма треньори, водачи, учители, мениджъри и опит в планината, да
постигне желаните резултати.
Освен континенталните първенции най-високите върхове на планетата,
изкачвам и много други върхове в България и чужбина, взимам участие и в други
спортни активности за усъвършенстване и подобряване на физическото си и
психическото си състояние и придобиване на необходими умения и опит.
2.  Защо веганство?
Преминах на 1 януари 2012г на
вегански режим на хранене без консумация на храна от животински произход. Бях 6
години преди това вегетарианец, но търсих някаква промяна не само в режима си
на хранене, а и промяна в начина си на живот, промяна в мисленето си, в
действията си, в морала си, в поведението си, както и промяна на физическото си
тяло. Всичко бе подчинено на изследването да преустановя консумацията на храна
от животински произход и да изследвам тялото си и психиката си. Според мен
трябва да се експериментира, за да се намери оптималното решение. Вече почти 4
години съм веган и не мога все още да направя задълбочени изводи, но смея да
твърдя, че за сега се чувствам много добре и на този етап нямам намерение да
променям режима си на хранене. Единствено се запознавам с нови растителни храни,
както и комбинации между тях. От друга страна някои лекари са на мнение че, в
момента организма ми консумира запасите в тялото ми и след 5-​тата или 6- ​тата
година като веган, в организма ми ще настъпят усложнения в здравословното ми
състояние. Уважавам мнението на лекарите, но за мен е много по-​важно сам да
проверя как ще функционира организма ми за напред. Разбира се, както вече
казах, всичко това е един експеримент и винаги може да се промени нещо, ако се
наложи. Аз се храня с това което ми е вкусно и ми се яде. Най-​важно е да
разбера дали този режим на хранене е подходящ за нас хората, защото по този
начин ще можем да намалим значително и дори преустановим консумацията на
животни, което е свързано не само с много предимства и ползи за здравето на
човека, но тук става въпрос да предпазим планетата от глобално замърсяване и
намиране на изход с изхранването на все по-силно увеличаващата се популация от хора
на планетата Земя. Селскостопанските площи, върху които отглеждаме нашата храна
и тази на животните с които се храним, са ограничени и въпреки че се създават
нови селскостопански площи в някои райони, то в други тези площи се урбанизират
и преминават в друг статут на ползване, най-​вече промишлен и жилищен. Така или
иначе селскостопанските площи не могат да нарастват безкрайно, ограничени са.
Населението обаче може да нараства докато има с какво да се изхранва.
По-​голямата част от обработваемите селскостопански площи и пасища са за храна
на животните. Ако се намали консумацията на месо и животинска продукция, ще има
много повече площи за растителна храна за хората и така населението на земята
може да нараства двойно повече. Другият много важен факт е, че промишленото гледане на животни е много голям
замърсител на планетата. Разрушаването на озоновият слой се дължи най-вече на
метана, който се отделя от храносмилателната система на животните. По данни на
ООН дела на парниковите газове при отглеждането на животни е около 50%. На
планета се отглеждат и изяждат годишно над 70 милиарда животни, които консумират
2/3 от
питейната вода и допринасят за замърсяване на водите и цялата планета. Също
така за да се задоволи пазара на месо и животински продукти все повече гори и
джунгли се превръщат в пасища или се използват за нуждите на животновъдството.
Този отрасъл се превръща в най-големият консуматор на питейна вода и използване
на природните ресурси. Изтребването и експлоатирането на животните от човека е
друга важна тема, която в момента не искам да коментирам. Тази планета е убежище
за всички животински видове и човека и всеки трябва да има равен шанс да живее
на нея без да бъде отглеждан за консумация от човека. За мен е много важно
всеки да се храни според вътрешните си убеждения, морал и ценностна система. 
Да търся границите на човешките
възможности и границите на вегана, които са пряко свързани със Силата на духът
и вярата в неограничените възможности, са мой основен приоритет. Всичко първо
трябва да се случи в главата и да повярваме в него и след това да го приложим и
на практика.
Ако този режим на хранене като веган е подходящ за
най-натоварващата тялото и психиката дейност- височинният алпинизъм, значи може
спокойно хората да живеят само с растителна храна. Дори само намаляването на
консумацията на месо, риба, мляко, сирене и яйца на половина, ще доведе до
намаляване на половина на вредният въглероден отпечатък от животновъдството
върху планетата, както и половината площи за отглеждане на храна за животните,
може да бъдат залесени с гори или използвани за отглеждане на растителна храна
за човека.
3.  Защо планината?
За мен планината е нещо много
специално, където открих всичко от което имам нужда. Там се чувствам свободен,
балансиран, в комфорт със себе си и мога да размишлявам върху всичко, което ме
вълнува и да намеря отговори на въпросите, които си задавам. Вярвам, че не само
на мен планината помага да се чувствам добре, да ме зарежда с енергия и да ме
учи, а и на много други хора. Затова мога само да препоръчам на тези които още
не са се докоснали до магията на планината, а имат желание, просто да го
направят. Един поход, малък преход.…ако им хареса да продължат. Ако не е
тяхното място, просто да намерят своето място. Всеки има свое място на
планетата, където се чувства добре, балансиран и в хармония със себе си и
заобграждащата го среда.
Планината ми помага да открия много фини детайли от
моя характер, както и да размишлявам върху живота и неговите закономерности. Обичам
много България и природата и специално се завърнах да живея в нашата родина.
Имаме уникална планета, която е прекрасно място за
съществуване на нашата човешка раса. За съжаление с глобализирането и
индустриализацията все повече унищожаваме природата и най-​вече екосистемите с
огромните и многобройни ферми за отглеждане на животни. Всеки ден изчезват
растителни и животински видове. Боли ме за тази планета и искам това, което аз
виждам сега с очите си, мириша с носа си, чувствам с кожата си и дишам с
дробовете си, да могат и нашите деца, внуци и правнуци да имат същият шанс и те
да се насладят на красотата и вдъхновението на нашата природа. Просто нека
всички се опитаме да живеем колкото може природосъобразно и се опитваме с
елементарни неща да предпазваме нашата планета от замърсяване. Не може човек да
се нарича и да се мисли за природо-защитник и да консумира храна от животински
произход. 
Трябва да се върнем отново към Майката-природа. Тя ни
учи на много неща и ни дава отговори на въпросите. Трябва да пазим природата,
защото ще я загубим.
Въпреки, че
от сравнително скоро се занимавам с алпинизъм и спортове в планината, съм се
отдал изцяло на планината и природата.
4.  Цели на проекта
Целта ми е да покажа на повече хора, че има и друг
начин на живот освен най-​разпространения. Че след като човек, който никога не
е спортувал преди, може да се справи с едно от най-​големите натоварвания –
височинния алпинизъм, значи и без животински продукти се живее пълноценно. Зад
всичко това прозира Силата на духа и неограничените човешки възможности.
Основната цел на настоящия проект е, да се
провери дали липсата на животинска храна в менюто на човека ще се отрази
неблагоприятно на неговите физически и психически качества. Напротив, да се
провери дали без консумация на храна с животински произход, човешкият организъм
функционира добре и може да постигне високи физически и психически резултати.
Друга цел на проекта е, да се покаже че няма
невъзможни неща и всичко е постижимо, ако вярваш в него и положиш необходимият
труд за това. Да изследваме собственото си тяло и да открием кое е най-​добре
за него, като се опитаме максимално да опазваме околната среда и да живеем в
хармония със себе си и природата. Да вярваме в себе си и в силата на нашите
възможности.
Затова предприех изкачване на всички континентални
първенци на планетата, както и на всички върхове над осем хиляди метра без консумация
на храна от животински произход от човек, който никога не е бил спортист и не е
тренирал спортове.
5.  Временни резултати:
С изкачването на връх Винсън Масив
на 22 декември 2014г са преодолени 6 континентални първенци– на Африка, Европа,
Южна Америка, Азия, Австралия и Океания и на Антарктида и достигане на 6900м на
връг Ленин, Памир за по-​малко от 2 години. На 01.10.2015г. изкачих връх
Манаслу в Хималаите, като първа експедиция от подпроект 2.
Смея да твърдя, че се чувствам много добре физически и
психически и  продължавам да съм с веган
режим на хранене. През няколко месеца провеждам и медицински прегледи и давам
кръвни проби, където се следят нормите на важни за здравето показатели. 
За 2014 и 2015 година съм направил презентации в
различни градове на България-Сливен, Русе, Пловдив, София, Варна, Мездра,
Враца, Козлодуй и други. Моят пример продължава да увлича младите, хора,
обичащи планината и здравословния начин на живот и всички тези мечтатели, които
вярват в себе си, искат да намерят себе си и чрез моя пример аз показвам
нагледно реализирането на промяната към която те се стремят. Не искам да
налагам на никой моя начин на живот, особено веганството. Нека всеки открие сам
за себе си правилният начин за него на живот. Моето послание към всички е да
открият какво ги прави щастливи и в баланс със себе си и околната среда. Всяка
мечта може да бъде сбъдната, ако вярваш в нея и положиш необходимият труд.
Искам да покажа, че невъзможни неща няма. Всичко е възможно и нека всеки вярва
в мечтите си и силата на духът си.
Нека обаче се замислим върху животновъдството, какво
ни дава и какво ни отнема. За мен е важно всички хора да имат информация за
храната, особено от животински произход и до какво води нейното производство. Как
е стигнала животинската храна до трапезата и какво е предизвикала. Тогава вече
може всеки сам да реши с какво да се храни и как да живее на тази планета.
6.  Подпроекти:
6.1. Подпроект 1:
Изкачване на Седемте континентални
първенци на нашата планета без консумация на животинска храна
Начало на проекта: 01.03.2012г.

Всичките 14

Начало на
проекта: 01.09.2015г.
Край на
проекта: 31.12.2020г.
Изпълнител
на проекта: д-​р Атанас Скатов, роден на 11.03.1978г. в гр. Сливен.
Магистър по Растителна защита на Аграрен университет — Пловдив и доктор на
Хумболдт университет Берлин, Германия. Д-​р Атанас Скатов не консумира месо от
януари 2007г, а риба от декември 2009г. В началото на 2012
преустановява консумацията на животинска храна. До лятото на 2010г. Атанас Скатов не извършва почти никаква физическа
активност, като последно се е занимавал със спорт в ученическите си години 1990-1996г.
История на изкачването на 14-те най-високи върха на
нашата планета:
Първия човек,
осъществил този проект е Райнхолд Меснер през 1988г. Били са му нужни 18
 години,
за да изкачи всичките 14 върха без използване на изкуствен кислород. За 
тези 27
години успяват общо 34 човека към днешна дата да стъпят на всичките 14 
върха,
между които има и 3 жени. От тези 34 човека 14 не са използвали 
изкуствен
кислород при изкачванията. Най-бързото изкачване на 14-те върха до 
момента е осъществено
за 8 години. За изкачване на всеки един от тези върхове е нужна много 
добра
физическа и психическа подготовка, както и заплащане на такса за върха и
 включване в експедиция. За изкачване на всичките върхове
са нужни около 230 000 долара, при положение че бъдат изкачвани от първи
опит, което досега не се е случило с нито един алпинист, успял да 
завърши
проекта си.
Цели на подпроект 2: 
1. 
Изкачване
на 14-те осемхилядници от веган; (за първи път в света)
2. 
Изкачване
на 4-ри осемхилядника в един сезонза 100 дни; (за
първи път в света)
3. 
Изкачване
на 5 осемхилядника в една календарна година; (за първи път в света)
4. 
Изкачване
на 6 осемхилядника за 12 месеца; (за първи път в света)
5. 
Изкачване
на 14 осемхилядника за по-малко от 6 години или колкото може по-бързо от веган,
за да се натовари тялото на възможно максимална степен. (за първи път в света)
Всички набелязани
цели не са постигани досега дори и от човек с общ „нормален“ режим на хранене и
професионална алпийска подготовка. 
7. 
Материал и метод:
-подържане на висока спортна форма,
здрав дух и психика;
-целогодишни тренировки в България и
чужбина;
-вегански режим на хранене; 100% само
растителна храна;
-извършване на подробни медицински и
лабораторни изследвания за здравословното ми състояния;
-събиране на нужните финансови средства
за осъществяване на експедициите;
-всекидневно водене на дневник с
описание на физическата натовареност, консумираната храна по вид и количество и
други важни подробности;
-описване на всяка експедиция в книга и
заснемане на филм;
-разпространение на дейността чрез
презентации в България и чужбина, книги, филми, брошури, участие във фестивали в
цял святи др.;
8. 
Временни
резултати на подпроект 2
На 01.10.2015г, в 5.50 часа непалско
време Атанас Скатов успява успешно да достигне връх Манаслу без да използва
изкуствен кислород. Връх Манаслу е осмият по височина връх на планетата-висок 8165м
в Хималаите, като това е първата експедиция от подпроект 2. Въпреки трудностите
и два неуспешни опити непосредствено преди достигане върха, Атанас Скатов не се
отказва и прави трети опит, като между отделните опити е почивал само 2 дни.
След като достига върха при минус 25 градуса с изгрева на слънцето и цяла нощ
катерене, преди него има 8 алпиниста и се налага да остане 50 минути на едно
място непосредствено под самия връх. След това прекарва още 20 минути в снимки
и видео на върха, Атанас Скатов решава след върха да ползва изкуствен кислород,
който носи за спешен случай и диша около 40 минути на слизане до височина около
7600м. Така Атанас Скатов става първия веган в света, който изкачва върха само
с консумация на растителна храна и по време на експедицията и успява до самият
връх да се изкачи без консумация на изкуствен кислород.
9. 
Изводи и
заключение.
Ако този режим
на хранене се докаже като здравословен за нас хората, би могло да се  намали консумацията на месо и животинска
продукция, което ще доведе до огромно намаляване на замърсяването на нашата
планета в резултат на отглеждането на животни и производството на храна от
животински произход в промишлени количества. Също така ще се освободят
селскостопански площи, които могат да бъдат използвани за производство на
растителна храна и така би могло да се помогне при решаването на проблема със
световния глад и спокойно увеличаване на населението на нашата планета. От
друга страна ще се спре изсичането на горите и джунглите, което сега се прави за
нуждите на животновъдството, както и ще се намали консумацията на питейни
запаси от вода. На освободените селскостопански площи може да започне засаждане
на нови гори и джунгли. Експериментът е
с огромно значение за цялото човечество и за запазването на природата на нашата
планета.
Експериментът
продължава за неограничен период от време. 
За да се проведе
този експеримент е нужна финансова подкрепа.

</strong><h3>Bonjour,<br/>Je suis Rebecca, active dans le domaine de la protection des espèces sauvages menacées et du bien être animal. J'ai durant ces 7 dernières années collaboré pour plusieurs associations de défense de cétacés et soutenu plusieurs association de protection des animaux.

Je m'implique aujourd'hui à faire mon possible pour améliorer leur condition de vie. C'est donc tout naturellement que j'ai proposé mon aide dans l'affaire des chevaux abandonnés de Boncourt. Voici leur histoire telle qu'elle m'a été contée:</h3>
<p></p>
<p>A Boncourt (Canton du Jura, en Suisse) en octobre dernier, 35 chevaux ont été abandonnés dans leur structure d'hivernage par le propriétaire Mr X. A l’époque, le contrat entre MX et le propriétaire des lieux, Mr Prêtre, ne consistait qu’à la location d’un bâtiment et non la prise en charge des frais relatifs à une pension de chevaux. En occurrence, Mr X était tenu d’assurer lui-même les soins indispensables aux besoins fondamentaux de ses 35 chevaux. Mais depuis le mois d’octobre, Mr X s’est volatilisé dans la nature sans laisser de nouvelles.<br/>Mr Prêtre ne pouvait plus supporter de voir l’état des chevaux se dégrader. Par bonne conscience il a donc nourri et paillé les animaux avec son propre fourrage du 13 octobre 2014 à ce jour.<br/>Il n’a désormais plus les moyens d’assurer les frais de ces 33 animaux. Mais l’absence de soins sanitaires et vétérinaires a détérioré considérablement l’état des équidés.<br/>A ce jour, plusieurs plaintes ont été déposées au ministère public, à la police et auprès du service vétérinaire du canton.</p>
<p>Le service vétérinaire, a mandaté un collaborateur pour venir effectuer le 20 janvier un constat de la situation et de l’état des animaux.<br/>Suite à cette expertise, le service vétérinaire estime ne pas être compétant pour traiter cette affaire qui relève du droit civil. Tout au plus, une plainte peut être déposée au Ministère Public pour négligence et abandon de chevaux.</p>
<p>Monsieur Prêtre attend donc une réponse du service vétérinaire suite aux plaintes déposées.</p>
<p>A l’heure actuelle, il lui est impossible financièrement d’assurer l’entretien de 35 chevaux sans être rétribué par Mr X.</p>
<p>Malgré tout, et suite à la mobilisation de plusieurs passionnés, bénévoles et associations, depuis le 31 janvier l'état sanitaire des chevaux s'est grandement amélioré. Ils ont pu bénéficier de vermifuges, parages, et divers soins d'hygiène.</p>
<p>L'association NetAP en collaboration avec l'AJPA, ont financé l'achat de paille et foin qui nous permet de subvenir aux besoins des 33 chevaux pendant 2 semaines.</p>
<p>Je vous invite tous à m’aider à venir en aide aux 35 chevaux abandonnés en contribuant au financement du fourrage, paille et foin.</p>
<p>J’ai fixé le montant de la collecte à 1500€, ce qui représente à peu près à 1 semaine de paille et de foin. Ce serait magnifique si nous pouvions ensemble atteindre la somme de 3500€ ce qui représenterait deux semaines de foin et de paille pour les chevaux ! Si nous atteignons la somme de 6 750€ les 35 chevaux disposeraient de fourrage pour un mois supplémentaire !</p>
<p>La totalité de vos dons sera directement versés sur le compte de Mr Prêtre.</p>
<p>Cette initiative est personnelle et je n’ai aucun cadeau à vous proposer en retour, mais vous pourrez recevoir des nouvelles des animaux et bien sur leur rendre visite.

<p><strong>Peak Water</strong> is the point where our demands for safe clean freshwater begin to exceed the combined abilities of nature and man to replenish and supply it affordably and without harming ecosystems. The term was coined by Peter Gleick and Meena Palaniappan, who in a 2010 <a href=""http://www.pacinst.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2013/02/concept_of_peak_water_20113.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: #39c; text-decoration: underline;"" target=""_blank"">peer-reviewed article</a> distinguish between peak renewable, peak non-renewable and peak ecological water to demonstrate that although there is a vast amount of water on Earth, sustainably managed water is becoming increasingly scarce.</p>

Because the gap between supply and demand is routinely bridged with non-renewable groundwater, even more so during drought, groundwater supplies in some major aquifers will be depleted in a matter of decades.

At an average cost of about 20 cents a gallon, EcoloBlue AWGs are far more economical than any bottled water solutions, and with their solar power option they can provide off-the-grid potable water independence.  Contribute to PeakWaterUS.com and get an exclusive nontransferable discount coupon worth up to <b>20% off</b> your purchase!</p>

</div></div>","Peak Water: The point where demands for safe clean freshwater begin to exceed the combined abilities of nature and man to replenish and supply it.

PeakWaterUS.com will be a hydroactivist platform for raising awareness of, empowering activism regarding, and offering self-sufficiency preparedness for the Peak Water era. It will operate as a self-sustaining social enterprise website employing a freemium business model with membership subscription and preparedness product sales revenues promoted by ethical affiliate marketing. The proceeds from this campaign will be used to design, develop, populate and promote the PeakWaterUS.com platform.

Prospectus
Climate change from corporate greed is reshaping our planet.  We are entering the era of Peak Water and the Water Wars have begun.  Unseen by many, here in America a battle is raging to determine whether the last drop of groundwater pumped from the last exploitable aquifer will be diverted for fracking by Big Oil, contaminated with pesticides by Big Ag/Big Food, polluted with prescription drugs by Big Pharma, or bottled in plastic and sold for a king's ransom by Big Water.
Join us in building out PeakWaterUS.com and the answer to the above can be none of the above.  With your support we will produce and propagate a hydroactivist social enterprise platform that will:

 open the eyes of the media-mesmerized and help them see their right to safe cleaning drinking water is no longer guaranteed;

 give them the targets and tools they need to engage in the fight for their hydropolitical rights and sustainable freshwater; and

 offer water acquisition, purification, conservation and self-sufficiency preparedness to assure potable water for them and theirs.


Support PeakWaterUS.com and you'll be helping yourself, your children, fellow mankind and future generations.  In return for your support you'll receive the satisfaction that comes from doing the right thing, our appreciation (to all) and recognition (your option) for making PeakWaterUS.com possible, and your choice from a number of what can be tax-deductible perks - including our 100/100/100 Bonus Perk - that each provide a return of value far in excess of your contribution.  You will truly be doing well by doing good!

Plan
The PeakWaterUS.com social entrepreneurial platform will leverage a modified freemium online business model built on a foundation of seven contextual pillars:
1. Problem2. Prognosis3. Proactivity4. Policies5. Practices6. Products7. Prosperity


❶ Problem

Peak Oil Is Here
97.5% or more of all water on Earth is saline.  Less than 0.75% of the freshwater remaining is accessible to sustain all non-marine plant and animal life.  And as the United States fracks its homeland and attacks overseas to maximize its share of a finite and dwindling global fossil fuel supply, more and more vital potable water is being lost to hydraulic fracturing along with herbicide contamination, industrial pollution and the effects of CO2- and methane-accelerated climate change.

What You're Told & What You're Not

This is Table 14. Trends in estimated water use in the United States, 1950-2010 which you will find buried near the end of the USGS Estimated Use of Water in the United States in 2010 published for the first time on 5-Nov-14. Although it shows an alarming amount of our water supply being diverted to fracking, you'll have a hard time finding any coverage of it in the media beyond half-truth ""don't worry, be happy"" headlines like ""United States Water Use Drops to Lowest Level in 40 Years.""

❷ Prognosis

Peak Water Is Near
Peak Water is the point where our demands for safe clean freshwater begin to exceed the combined abilities of nature and man to replenish and supply it affordably and without harming ecosystems. The term was coined by Peter Gleick and Meena Palaniappan, who in a 2010 peer-reviewed article distinguish between peak renewable, peak non-renewable and peak ecological water to demonstrate that although there is a vast amount of water on Earth, sustainably managed water is becoming increasingly scarce.
Water scarcity is no longer just a third-world problem. Drought, drilling, industrial and other demands on an already-stressed water supply have brought about unprecedented levels of groundwater depletion  throughout the U.S.  Since 2000 the average rate of water withdrawal has been nearly 2.8 times higher than the 20th century average for the nation.  The key Ogallala Aquifer is just one of many being overpumped at increasingly unsustainable rates.  Once depleted, natural replenishment could take up to 1,300 years.

Groundwater Depletion: Alarming Decline in Aquifer Storage

According to hydrologist Jay Famiglietti, UC Irvine Professor and JPL Senior Water Scientist, ""In many parts of the world, in particular in the dry, mid-latitudes, far more water is used than is available on an annual, renewable basis. Precipitation, snowmelt, and streamflow are no longer enough to supply the multiple, competing demands for society's water needs. Because the gap between supply and demand is routinely bridged with non-renewable groundwater, even more so during drought, groundwater supplies in some major aquifers will be depleted in a matter of decades. The myth of limitless water and the free-for-all mentality that has pervaded groundwater use must now come to an end.""

❸ Proactivity

Doing Well By Doing Good
We can't drink oil and we can't keep sacrificing our shrinking potable water supply to get it.  Recent history shows we also can't rely on local, state or federal governments to protect America's water from those who would privatize, pollute and poison it. What we can do is take it upon ourselves to maintain accessible fresh water today and sustain it for our children tomorrow.  PeakWaterUS.com will provide its members a social entrepreneurial platform to empower that proactivity.

❹ Policies

Right To Water Trumps Water Rights
PeakWaterUS.com will alert its members about key issues in hydropolitics (the politics of water) and significant actions of corporations, lobbyists, politicians, governments, government agencies and NGOs (non-governmental organizations) in the water privatization and hydropolitical arenas.  It will also provide its members with strategies, tactics and tools for taking grassroots action to preserve the fundamental human right to clean water for themselves and future generations.

H2O: Hydrology, Hydroactivism & History

In this interview Dr. Peter Gleick of the Pacific Institute - the hydrologist credited with coining  the phrase ""Peak Water"" - states his position that ""We have to realize that water is both a human right [and] an economic good.""
As hydroactivists, we cannot accept that position because it opens the door for Big Water to apply a relative measure to an absolute right - as Nestle Chairman Peter Brabeck does in this interview where he brazenly asserts ""I am absolutely  convinced that the 5 liters [1.3 gallons] of water that we need  for hydration and the 25 liters of water [6.6 gallons] that we  need for minimum hygiene is a human right, and that the human  right is the responsibility of each government to assure that  people have access to this amount of water.  This amount of water  - of human right - accounts for 1.5% of the water that we are  using as human beings.  What I'm saying is that the 98.5% of the  water that we are misusing is not a human right.""
If we let Big Water get away with this subversion, it will only be a matter of time before the term ""Big Air"" takes on a whole new meaning.

❺ Practices

Sustainability Through Conservation
PeakWaterUS.com will empower its members to do more with less.  Recent reports that ""U.S. Water Usage is Lowest in Decades"" rarely disclose the claim is based on 2010 data, does not include the massive diversion of water to fracking since 2010, and reflects industrial decline more than reduced consumer usage.  Americans still use 89 gallons (337L) of water per day which more than doubles the UK (150L), almost triples Germany (122L) and exceeds six times UN recommendations (50L).

<p></p>
<p>The Picnic Point Preservation Committee, a <em>neighborhood-based, non-profit citizen action committee, is d</em>eeply concerned about a proposed housing development, ""Frognal Estates."" The plan is to clear cut 19 of 23 acres of forested land located on a
hilltop with steep slopes on three sides. This property, home to at least 48 different
types of birds and animals, is located in an extremely environmentally-sensitive
area. It is part of the Picnic Point Watershed area and is located uphill from
Picnic Point Creek, a salmon-bearing salmon. There is Native Growth Protection
Area all around the property, and a Snohomish County-designated wetland
downhill from the property. The area has a long history of landslide activity, and the most recent documented landslide was in April of 2014.</p>
<p>The
proposed land to be developed is presently steep hillsides and ravines. The developer’s
plan includes massively regrading the earth by removing 60 feet of vertical
soil, filling in 40 foot ravines, and terracing the remaining hillside with a
series of retaining walls. This amount of regrading is unheard of, but with Snohomish County aggressively looking to increase
their property tax base, it is possible the developer will get his way and
change Picnic Point forever. This proposed development will increase the
likelihood of landslides, erosion and flooding in the Picnic Point
 Valley, as well as the possible extinction of documented salmon in nearby Picnic Point Creek due to sedimentation.</p>
<p>According to Snohomish
 County, this development
will increase daily traffic on Picnic
  Point Road by 1,100 cars and 117 cars during peak
hours. These additional vehicles will add to existing road congestion at the Picnic Point Road/Beverly Park Road
traffic light, especially during morning and evening commute hours. There are
no plans, either by the developer or Snohomish
 County, to do anything
regarding installing sidewalks on Picnic
  Point Road to insure the safety of our children.
More cars on the road mean a greater chance for accidents involving pedestrians
who are forced to walk on streets without proper sidewalks. </p>
<b>
</b><p><b>What can I do now? Is it too late to act?</b></p>
<p>No! The application is still in the review process at Snohomish County and HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED YET. With your generous donation we will have the ability to pay off our current attorney fees AND pay for the professional Geo-Tech report needed to show hard evidence to the county about landslide and watershed issues. In the future we will be hiring a Traffic Engineer to do a full study and report on the safety and traffic impact on our local streets. Our attorney has advised us that these experts are needed based upon those who have successfully stopped such developments before. But we cannot do this without the ability to pay the bills. We need donations to continue forward by hiring these important professionals. PLEASE consider supporting this cause with any amount you can donate.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Build the Community, One Can at a Time</h3>
<p>None deny that recycling provides an environmental benefit, but it seems the advantage recycling gives to our earth does not hit home enough to motivate action. At Caring Cans, we motivate people to do a good thing (recycle) by giving them a good thing (build charities) in return.</p>
<p>In short, we collect aluminum cans, recycle them, then donate 100% of our revenues to local charitable causes. All money generated in a given community is donated back to organizations and causes in the same community in which we collected the aluminum cans. This is our way of giving back.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why Raise Funds?</h3>
<p>The money raised through Indiegogo will sustain our organization for the next 5 years without need for another fundraising event. Caring Cans' administrative staff is strictly volunteer and our ongoing administrative costs are minimal. The purpose of our Indiegogo campaign is to raise the required funds to lift our organization off the ground.</p>
<p>The funding we receive through this campaign will go toward 3 principal expenses:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Website and Hosting Costs</li>
<li>Collection Bins and Supplies</li>
<li>Marketing Materials</li>
</ol>
<p>Most of these costs are not reoccurring, and those costs which are reoccurring are minimal. Your donations are guaranteed to be long-lasting!</p>
<p>The greatest perk to donating to Caring Cans is knowing that your reach will be extended for years to come! At our 5 year mark, we hope to be raising $20,000+/annually and every penny will be donated to local causes.</p>

<p>Water is the most essential natural resource but it only available for human and land animal use in limited amounts.  The natural water cycle is for rain to be absorbed back into the ground and slowly back into our rivers and streams.  With urbanization pouring concrete and pavement the effectiveness is greatly reduced and the water runs into storm drains and into the rivers in streams carrying the pollutants that would normally be cleaned out by the sand and clay of the earth.</p>

<p>While researching to write an article on<a href=""http://www.recycledplastic.com/resource/plastic-recycling/recycling-plastic-bag-facts/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Recycling Plastic Bag Facts</a>, I discovered numerous articles online about creative ways to <em>reuse plastic bags</em>. Even though there are some good ideas out there, most focus on reusing the plastic bag only once or several times.</p>
<p>For example, a website suggests wrapping a plastic bag â€œaround paintbrushes if you stop mid-project to prevent the paint from drying out.â€ You may think this is an excellent idea, however, what will happen to the plastic bag now that it is contaminated with paint? It is no longer suitable for recycling.</p>
<p>To be sustainable, we need to think of creative ways to reuse plastic bags as many times as possible making sure it stays contaminant free, that is, away from glues, paints, and other chemicals. When the plastic bag is no longer usable, recycle it at a facility suitable for plastic bags. This way, the plastic bag can be remade into something useful.</p>
<p>**Most curbside recycling programs actually do not accept plastic bags, do your research before putting plastic bags in the recycling bin.</p>

<p><strong>Here my top 5 ways of reusing and recycling plastic bags:</strong></p>

<li>Always keep plastic bags (including grocery bags and bags from department stores) in your car. Reusing grocery bags is actually much more eco-friendly than using thicker tote bags made from cotton or non-woven fabric (lower carbon emissions).</li>
<li>Bring used plastic bags to the supermarket. After unloading the purchased items at home, I always tie each bag in knots and bring them immediately back to the car. I find that if I leave them on my kitchen top, I tend to forget.</li>
<li>Use DIY checkout counters so you can fill each bag with more items. You also have better control over how to load each bag. For bags that are about to break, I like to fill it with lighter items.</li>
<li>Use plastic bags as trashcan liners for paper or dry items only. When emptying the wastebasket, do not throw out the plastic bag. Pour the contents into a larger trash bag for disposal.</li>
<li>Store products using plastic bags at home. Theyâ€™re great for keeping dust away. You can also use plastic bags to sort items in your freezer. Bring plastic bags in your luggage case when traveling to store dirty clothing.</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>MuseArt is a company set up by 3 young women, our aim is to mobilise society and the youth in particular to pay attention to the global issues that impact their lives and inspire them to use their skills and passions in film, art, music, sport or science to better themselves and the world they live in.</p>
<p>The Plastic Oceans Exhibition focuses on the grave problem of plastic pollution. The planet is quickly becoming a tidal wave of plastic waste. Over half of the plastic we use is used only once and then thrown away.  the problem is that there is no “away”.  The impact on wildlife, the environment and the potential harm to human health are only now becoming clear.  The facts are that we have to do something and do it now. Brandon Boyd created a series of art to raise awareness about the islands of plastic floating about in the world's seas. We aim to showcase this artwork in South Africa to start a movement aimed at combating this problem because despite our vast shoreline (South Africa has impacts on both the Atlantic and Indian Oceans) , the issue has not been adequately raised amongst young people. We hope that through art we can inspire action to protect our seas.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>MuseArt needs a total of $3 000 to make this awareness initative a reality and we're hoping to get some of that right here! The money raised will go towards hiring our exhibition space and shipping of the inspiring artwork half way across the world to do it's job in motivating young people to care for the ocean. Even if we don't reach our goal, every cent raised will go towards the exhibition, which we are adamant about going ahead with.</p>
<p>We have some great perks for donors, from little gifts of plush sea creatures, your name on our wall of heroes at the exhibition, to entry tickets to the actual exhibition (transport not included) as well as VIP tickets to our launch night.</p>
<p> <strong>The Impact</strong></p>

 its formation in the late 1990s, The Ocean Project has grown from a 
handful of founding North American aquariums into the world’s most 
extensive network for advancing ocean education and action. Our growing 
network includes approximately <a href=""http://theoceanproject.org/partner-landing/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">2,000 partner aquariums, zoos, science, technology, and natural history museums</a>,
 and other education and conservation organizations, agencies, and 
institutions in all 50 U.S. states and 80 other countries that together 
serve more than 400 million visitors each year. The Ocean Project seeks 
to build upon the work of existing institutions and organizations and 
spark meaningful engagement.<p></p><p>The concept for a “World 
Ocean Day” was first proposed in 1992 by the Government of Canada at the
 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. As a result of a United Nations General
 Assembly <a href=""http://www.un.org/Depts/los/reference_files/worldoceansday.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">resolution</a> passed in December 2008, World Oceans Day is now officially recognized by the UN as June 8th each year</p><p>Since 2002, <a href=""http://www.theoceanproject.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Ocean Project</a> has
 helped promote and coordinate World Oceans Day events worldwide. Each 
year an increasing number of countries and organizations have been

And more!
WORLD OCEANS DAY IS PEOPLE-POWEREDJune 8th 
is World Oceans Day - when thousands of people around the world 
celebrate and take action to create a healthier ocean for everyone. Last
 year's World Oceans Day again was an inspiring experience. People around the world came together and took action for the ocean’s healthy future in a big way, with over 600 events in 70 different countries,
 held by aquariums, zoos, schools, businesses, local governments, moms, 
surfers, and so many more. These are people are reaching out in their 
own communities to do something to help protect the ocean and what it does for each one of us. The funds we raise from this campaign will go towards growing the community and supporting the people who make this day possible - with free educational tools, personal support, a better website, and more.These events don't just happen on their own! World Oceans Day is a truly grass-roots effort, thanks to the hard work of many dedicated people all over the globe.With hundreds of events last year that reached 1 million on Facebook and over 55,000 on Twitter - all on a shoestring budget - we're ready to do our part and make it a global rallying point for taking better care of our ocean.While our actions on our own may seem inconsequential, together, collectively, we can and are making a real difference. Help us make World Oceans Day 2014 even bigger and better around the world. “Together we have the power to protect the ocean!”HELP POWER A WORLD THAT IS BLUEEarth
 is 70% ocean, yet we often focus 100% on land. Meanwhile the ocean, and the vital role it plays in human life, faces serious 
threats: massive overfishing, rampant plastic pollution, ocean 
acidification, climate change, and more. What will future generations 
inherit from us?Our hope is for a healthy, thriving ocean that continues to connect people everywhere - from every country, culture, and creed across the planet.
The great news is that people in communities all over the world are caring more about the oceans every day and are taking action. The Ocean Project helps them by coordinating World Oceans Day, a day of action and celebration held globally every June 8th.
 We need your help to give these amazing people and organizations the 
support they need. We want to take this event to the next level by providing organizers with free tools and materials, growing the community and its impact, greatly improving our online engagement platforms, and much more.SUPPORT & GROW THE IMPACTEven
 though many of us don’t see the ocean daily, the ocean affects us and 
we affect the ocean. Our actions help protect it and the animals that 
call the ocean home. World Oceans Day is an opportunity to create 
widespread action and discussion about what we each can DO to keep it 
healthy.Your personal contribution will help support our 
community of event organizers, and build 
World Oceans Day into a bigger global rallying point for celebration and
 action; it will be an even better day to unify organizations and 
capture people's imaginations around the
 world to create important changes, locally, nationally and 
internationally.By supporting us with a gift for the ocean, we'll be able to:
Greatly improve the World Oceans Day online engagement platforms
Provide free educational materials and tools to event organizers
Work tirelessly to promote this event and empower our partners to be the best ocean ambassadors to their communities
And much more. With your help, we can collectively grow this event into a real force for change. Thank you!
AN OCEAN OF ACTIONThere are too many World Oceans Day stories to share in this little space – read our 2013 wrap up to learn more about the wide variety of celebrations and people getting involved.Partners
 around the world asked people to make an Ocean Promise on June 8th to 
do something for the ocean for the rest of the year. Hundreds 
participated and made a promise to help the ocean! Check out their promises here.REWARDSTo thank you for your support, we've teamed up with Pergamo Paper Goods with ocean-themed art and stationary that is sure to delight you. Check out their website to see some awesome work!

BACKGROUND ON THE OCEAN PROJECTSince
 its formation in the late 1990s, The Ocean Project has grown from a 
handful of founding North American aquariums into the world’s most 
extensive network for advancing ocean education and action. Our growing 
network includes approximately 2,000 partner aquariums, zoos, science, technology, and natural history museums,
 and other education and conservation organizations, agencies, and 
institutions in all 50 U.S. states and 80 other countries that together 
serve more than 400 million visitors each year. The Ocean Project seeks 
to build upon the work of existing institutions and organizations and 
spark meaningful engagement.The concept for a “World 
Ocean Day” was first proposed in 1992 by the Government of Canada at the
 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. As a result of a United Nations General
 Assembly resolution passed in December 2008, World Oceans Day is now officially recognized by the UN as June 8th each yearSince 2002, The Ocean Project has
 helped promote and coordinate World Oceans Day events worldwide. Each 
year an increasing number of countries and organizations have been 
marking June 8th as an opportunity to celebrate the world ocean and our 
personal connection to the sea, as well as get involved in helping 
protect our ocean.The Ocean Project is a fiscally sponsored project of The Ocean Foundation. So we can thank you for your contribution, we will add
you to our mailing list - but it's simple to unsubscribe with one click.THANK YOU!All
 the photos and footage in our campaign video came from our partner 
organizations and World Oceans Day event organizers. We thank them for 
their continued support and suggest you check them out.Thanks to One World One Ocean for the amazing ocean footage.

antibiotikaresistente bakterier er på fremmarsj. En er for mye bruk av
antibiotika i helsevesenet og landbruket. En annen er bruken av
bakteriedrepende stoffer i hverdagsprodukter.Mattilsynet har i mer enn 10 år
jobbet for et europeisk forbud mot et av de vanligste antibakterielle stoffene:
Triklosan. Miljødirektoratet mener at unødvendig bruk av antibakterielle
stoffer, for eksempel i klær, bør stoppes.

Hvem
er vi?
Framtiden i våre hender er en av
Norges største miljøorganisasjoner, med 23.000 medlemmer og 20 lokallag. Vi har
arbeidet i 40 år for at det skal bli enklere å leve etisk og miljøvennlig. Vi
setter ofte søkelyset på forbrukerprodukter og selskapene som produserer dem,
fordi vi ser at dette ofte kan føre til raske endringer. 
Vi ønsker å jobbe mer med miljøgifter
framover. Mens klimaendringer og tap av naturmangfold får velfortjent mye
oppmerksomhet, er miljøgifter et tema som i mindre grad dekkes av den norske
miljøbevegelsen. Det ønsker vi å gjøre noe med.
Vi har jobbet lenge for at maten skal bli renere. I høst har vi gjennomført en test av deodoranter, og nå ønsker vi å følge opp med en test av klær.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

Our Vision
You’d like to buy products that are better for your family, as well as better for the planet – but to do that, you need answers to some basic questions. Does this product contain toxic ingredients? Was it made with renewable energy? Has the company taken steps to minimize waste in manufacturing, and then make the product recyclable?EarthTouch provides you with a simple way to get the information you need to make smart choices.When people vote with their wallets, companies listen. If everyone used their purchasing power to demand their products were made with clean energy, no harmful chemicals, and a reduced waste stream, companies would pay attention.EarthTouch In The Press:EcoWatchHuffington PostDailyKosYahoo FinanceEarthTouch will break new ground 

Independent evaluation – we'll provide a ""just the facts"" approach so you can make your own decisions about what to buy.

Multiple-categories – other apps only cover one product category. In order to shop effectively, you would need five different apps, cluttering up your phone.

Comprehensive – covering everything from clean energy to animal testing to product life cycle, you’ll have one app that gives you ALL the information you need.

Customizable – this is YOUR app. Set it to tell you about YOUR priorities.


Initially, EarthTouch will cover the following categories:


Packaged foods


Household cleaning products


Cosmetics


Clothing

Pet food

Consumers in the US alone spend over $1.2 trillion per year on these categories of products. After our rollout, we'll add more.
Referral CampaignIf your friends and followers donate you can get a commission and more.  Check how simple it is here;http://earthaccounting.com/blog/referrals/




Getting the data

The non-trivial part in any project like this is gathering the information to deliver to consumers.In order to do that, Earth Accounting is forming a strategic partnership – the Alliance for Consumer Empowerment and Sustainability (ACES), an information cooperative that will put together all the data for EarthTouch.We already have commitments from a wide range of eco-labels, environmental and government organizations, companies, and others who are providing the data we will deliver through EarthTouch.The TeamEarth Accounting, a benefit corporation, was formed specifically to build EarthTouch. Our team brings years of experience to the table – from the worlds of business, tech, media, academia, and environmental research. 

Funding
The $40,000 we are raising here on Indiegogo will act as seed money, allowing us to grow the infrastructure we will need to make this happen:

Finalize the design for the initial product categories
Finalize the go-to market strategy 


Conclusion



We’re all in this together. That’s why we’re building the ACES cooperative, why we’re forming alliances with industry leaders, and why we’re asking YOU to join in.
We have a few perks for you – at the $25 level you’ll get an organic cotton shopping tote to help remind you to shop smart every time you go to the store (see below). At higher levels, we’ve got a cool perk – a solar-powered lamp from our friends at Buy Green (see below). But this campaign is about a lot more than the perks – it’s about the future.
Become a partner with us. Help us harness consumerism that is in balance with the needs of people, businesses, and the planet.  Let us build you the tools that will benefit our children for a healthier, sustainable future.

But we are a group of professional, experienced guides who are committed to ensuring the safety of ourselves and our guests.</p>

They contribute, also, to increasing salinity in our soils, a sure death knell for the previously rich and productive soils that produce much of the world's agriculture. Also, dams have limited <a href=""http://perc.org/articles/deadbeat-dams"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" style=""color: rgb(14, 180, 182); text-decoration: none;"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://perc.org/articles/deadbeat-dams"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" style=""color: rgb(14, 180, 182); text-decoration: none;"" target=""_blank"">lifespans</a>, depending on a variety of factors, such as <a href=""http://www.internationalrivers.org/sedimentation-problems-with-dams"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" style=""color: rgb(14, 180, 182); text-decoration: none;"">sedimentation load</a>, seismic factors, evaporation, and upkeep costs.

Just like building the interstate system in the US required displacement of people, <a href=""http://www.internationalrivers.org/human-impacts-of-dams"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" style=""color: rgb(14, 180, 182); text-decoration: none;"" target=""_blank"">so</a> <a href=""http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/06/100604-dams-economic-impact/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" style=""color: rgb(14, 180, 182); text-decoration: none;"">does</a> <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-17754256"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" style=""color: rgb(14, 180, 182); text-decoration: none;"" target=""_blank"">building</a> <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/24/opinion/sunday/large-dams-just-arent-worth-the-cost.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" style=""color: rgb(14, 180, 182); text-decoration: none;"" target=""_blank"">dams. </a>To the tune of nearly half a <i>billion</i> people; mostly already impoverished people. The resettlement and displacement due to dams cause greater poverty, often alcoholism, and cultural destruction to the displaced people. The large corporations that fund big dams rarely account for the cost of compensating the people who live upstream of the dam, and leave that part up to the government of the developing country, which either doesn't or can't deliver on its promises. What's more, the people who live next to these life-giving rivers rarely want to leave. Sometimes they never even hear about the projects until they're already being built, and are forced, nightmarishly, to leave abruptly and forced onto unproductive lands with little or no money, no water, and no electricity to start them off.

<p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px;"">""The larger the dam, the more expensive its dismantling becomes, until, in the case of a hydroelectric megadam, the expense may surpass the cost of erecting it. Imagine these dams in five hundred or a thousand years, after their useful life has ended, when an earthquake from the fault line beneath Sardar Sarovar fractures it, or the bankruptcy of Zambia and Zimbabwe leads to Kariba's fatal neglect, or Three Gorges fills with sediment, or Katse gets too expensive to maintain--and when every one of them suffers from an altered hydrological regime as a result of climate change. Take your pick of mortal scenario: cumulatively, they're more plausible than the assumption that megadams will be successfully financed, adroitly managed, and properly maintained into perpetuity. Some dams will crumble into the basins from which they rose, while others may still be intact but no longer storing water, which instead runs over or through or around them. They'll be relics of the twentieth century, like Stalinism and gasoline-powered cars, symbols of the allure of technology and its transience, of the top-down, growth-at-all-costs era of development and international banks, of the delusion that humans are exempt from nature's dominion, of greed and indifference to suffering. If there are tourists then, they'll circulate through the ruins and they now inspect the Pyramids, awed by the structures' technological prowess and unimaginable cost. The people who lived around the dams will have been dispersed, of course, and their cultures shattered, and the rivers and their valleys may still be depleted. But the dams' ephemerality, not the rivers', will then be on display. They'll be reminders of an ancient time when humans believed they could vanquish nature, and found themselves vanquished instead.""</p>

The Marañon, in Peru, is its hydrological source, meaning it contributes the most water to its final flow, and contributes massively to the general vitality of the Amazon basin. Did you know that the Marañon contains the Grand Canyon of South America?  Or that it, and therefore the Amazon, is under attack? I don't blame you! I didn't either, until Paddling with Purpose brought to my attention the 20 large dams proposed for the river's 1000+ mile stretch.



Look at those walls! Makes you want to protect that river, doesn't it?
I am a river guide from the United States with nearly a decade of experience, passionately in love with free flowing water. Rivers have sustained me in my adulthood and now it's time for me to put some of my river miles to good use and give back. This is my chance to help save one of the last free flowing rivers in South America from yet another big hydro project.*
Paddling with Purpose is partnering with Conservamos Por Naturaleza to raise awareness about the threats to this amazing river. Along with a group of Peruvians who are engineers, environmental and social lawyers, biologists, marketing professionals, graphic designers, and film makers, we will be filming a documentary about the Rio Marañon and launching a huge media campaign in Peru to inspire Peruvians to explore their country. In order to do this, we're going to the heart of it- a river trip through the Grand Canyon of South America.   Where's my money going? 
Making movies and getting it out to LOTS of people costs money! There's cameras to pay for, software to edit the movie, the cost of producing the DVDs and distributing them. We need:



US$4000 for cameras and potential damages to them


US$1000 for the post-production of our film, and

US$3000 at least to promote the film throughout Peru. 

Getting people on the river cost money! Any of you who've ever done one know that. So firstly we need to pay for boats, frames, coolers, oars, PFDs (life vests), transportation and, of course, food! We need:



US$5000 for equipment rentals


US$3500 for food


US$3000 for transportation. 




Just me and some lovely people enjoying the rio!

Also, don't forget to check out all the cool things you can reward yourself with for supporting us in our mission to save the Marañon! 


What will this project accomplish?
Through its multimedia campaigns, Conservamos por Naturaleza has created an active and growing community of Peruvians who are exploring their natural heritage and taking an active role in its protection. Think of the Sierra Club's success to galvanize the US public into saving our Grand Canyon through massive media campaigns! A more recent example is the Patagonia Sin Respresas campaign, which successfully stopped dams in Chilean Patagonia.
Not only will this project help the 14% of Peruvians whose livelihood would be destroyed by a massive reservoir, but it also preserves the river for international travelers to enjoy! A river trip through the Grand Canyon in the United States has been called the trip of a lifetime. This could be another major river adventure destination. But only if it isn't turned into a reservoir first.
Risks & Challenges

Every project comes with risks. Of course, the challenges this campaign faces are nothing compared to those face by the river. There is always the potential that our efforts and the voices of the Peruvians directly affected will be drowned by the waters of yet another large dam, and by the money and power of huge corporations and the governments they're in bed with. We are doing everything we can do not let this happen.

With regards to our campaign, we risk having insufficient funds to leverage and effective media campaign in Peru. Filming on the river has obvious potential to damage the equipment and allows limited time to get the best shots. And of course, every whitewater river trip has inherent risk to the participants. But we are a group of professional, experienced guides who are committed to ensuring the safety of ourselves and our guests.



I'm a dirtbag raft guide with no money, what can I do?
I'm right there with you. Donating money can be daunting, especially when you're doing everything you can just to get by. But remember, literally every little bit helps. But, there are other things you can do to help! Share this page with YOUR parents and friends and family and let them know how much we care about rivers. Every little bit counts! Every river matters!
Volunteer on another expedition with Paddling with Purpose. Go on a rafting trip down the Marañon with Sierra Rios.
Go on a rafting or canoe trip on your local river, and learn about how important it is to your environment!
LEARN about dams: Watch DamNation to learn more about the US history of dams. Read a book about dams- I highly recommend Deep Water byJacque Leslie, or if you want something a bit wonkier and harder to read, there's always the classic Cadillac Desert by Marc Reisner. 
Raise a stink about protecting our precious rivers all over the world- consider getting engaged with your local conservation groups or bigger ones like American Rivers or International Rivers.




*I want to say a little bit more about big hydro, because I find that my opposition to big dams is not easily understood, or even close to universally held. Recently, Costa Rica made news for having generated the last couple months of power solely through ""renewable"" energy. The majority of that power is coming from hydroelectric dams in the country. But are dams renewable? Is hydropower green? Maybe not. Dams, we are finding out, contribute heavily to global warming through the emission of massive amounts of methane being released from the sediment buildup behind them. They contribute, also, to increasing salinity in our soils, a sure death knell for the previously rich and productive soils that produce much of the world's agriculture. Also, dams have limited lifespans, depending on a variety of factors, such as sedimentation load, seismic factors, evaporation, and upkeep costs. Not only that, but when we take into consideration the cost of removing dams, which always has to happen at some point, the benefits of building them in the first place don't look so good. So much for sustainable, so much for ""green"".
Next, let's take a look at the direct human consequences. Just like building the interstate system in the US required displacement of people, so does building dams. To the tune of nearly half a billion people; mostly already impoverished people. The resettlement and displacement due to dams cause greater poverty, often alcoholism, and cultural destruction to the displaced people. The large corporations that fund big dams rarely account for the cost of compensating the people who live upstream of the dam, and leave that part up to the government of the developing country, which either doesn't or can't deliver on its promises. What's more, the people who live next to these life-giving rivers rarely want to leave. Sometimes they never even hear about the projects until they're already being built, and are forced, nightmarishly, to leave abruptly and forced onto unproductive lands with little or no money, no water, and no electricity to start them off. All of this is largely in the name of ""development."" So much for that.
I will leave you with a thought from Jacques Leslie's incredible book Deep Water:
""The larger the dam, the more expensive its dismantling becomes, until, in the case of a hydroelectric megadam, the expense may surpass the cost of erecting it. Imagine these dams in five hundred or a thousand years, after their useful life has ended, when an earthquake from the fault line beneath Sardar Sarovar fractures it, or the bankruptcy of Zambia and Zimbabwe leads to Kariba's fatal neglect, or Three Gorges fills with sediment, or Katse gets too expensive to maintain--and when every one of them suffers from an altered hydrological regime as a result of climate change. Take your pick of mortal scenario: cumulatively, they're more plausible than the assumption that megadams will be successfully financed, adroitly managed, and properly maintained into perpetuity. Some dams will crumble into the basins from which they rose, while others may still be intact but no longer storing water, which instead runs over or through or around them. They'll be relics of the twentieth century, like Stalinism and gasoline-powered cars, symbols of the allure of technology and its transience, of the top-down, growth-at-all-costs era of development and international banks, of the delusion that humans are exempt from nature's dominion, of greed and indifference to suffering. If there are tourists then, they'll circulate through the ruins and they now inspect the Pyramids, awed by the structures' technological prowess and unimaginable cost. The people who lived around the dams will have been dispersed, of course, and their cultures shattered, and the rivers and their valleys may still be depleted. But the dams' ephemerality, not the rivers', will then be on display. They'll be reminders of an ancient time when humans believed they could vanquish nature, and found themselves vanquished instead.""",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div><h3>ecoCOMP Electronics Service and Recycling:</h3><div>
</div><p>My name is Evan Snow of Rochester, New York.  I was raised to believe that responsible conservation is the best way of protecting the environment, rather than oppressive regulations.  I was blessed to have parents that felt that their children should experience all that life had to offer, which led to my father exposing us all to the latest technology as well as the great outdoors.  This started a lifelong interest in technology with me and how it could improve the world.</p><div>
</div><p><strong>A Little About Me:</strong></p><div>
</div><p>In 1993, I had my first professional job as a PC Technician, and I have always kept my skills current.  I began to notice a growing concern as computers and other tech evolved, called e-waste.  As you can see by the video, the current US model is to dump all e-waste onto third world countries for marginal recycling.  This doesn't have to be this way.  In New York State, recycling centers built with taxpayer dollars are quietly being closed, and consumers are facing fines for trying to dispose of old electronics, especially old televisions.  At ecoCOMP, we collect and disassemble all electronics for responsible recycling.  Any working equipment we gather gets reconditioned and available for purchase at a fair price for consumers.  All data on old computers and cellphones is wiped completely, protecting privacy.</p><div>

</div><p>Founded in September 2012, ecoCOMP was started when I participated in the Green For Gold program.  This program helped me to get all the necessary certifications to start a Green business.  The set goal was to provide the community with an accessible place to drop off their old electronics for recycling, rather than letting them end up in a landfill, poisoning the environment.  Unfortunately, shortly after getting the business started, the program was abruptly ended before the start-up funds were provided.  To help offset the costs involved, ecoCOMP began to offer computer and electronics service, cellphone repairs and data wipe/recovery, to mention a few of the services.</p><div>

</div></div>","ecoCOMP Electronics Service and Recycling:
My name is Evan Snow of Rochester, New York.  I was raised to believe that responsible conservation is the best way of protecting the environment, rather than oppressive regulations.  I was blessed to have parents that felt that their children should experience all that life had to offer, which led to my father exposing us all to the latest technology as well as the great outdoors.  This started a lifelong interest in technology with me and how it could improve the world.
A Little About Me:
In 1993, I had my first professional job as a PC Technician, and I have always kept my skills current.  I began to notice a growing concern as computers and other tech evolved, called e-waste.  As you can see by the video, the current US model is to dump all e-waste onto third world countries for marginal recycling.  This doesn't have to be this way.  In New York State, recycling centers built with taxpayer dollars are quietly being closed, and consumers are facing fines for trying to dispose of old electronics, especially old televisions.  At ecoCOMP, we collect and disassemble all electronics for responsible recycling.  Any working equipment we gather gets reconditioned and available for purchase at a fair price for consumers.  All data on old computers and cellphones is wiped completely, protecting privacy.

Enter ecoCOMP:
Founded in September 2012, ecoCOMP was started when I participated in the Green For Gold program.  This program helped me to get all the necessary certifications to start a Green business.  The set goal was to provide the community with an accessible place to drop off their old electronics for recycling, rather than letting them end up in a landfill, poisoning the environment.  Unfortunately, shortly after getting the business started, the program was abruptly ended before the start-up funds were provided.  To help offset the costs involved, ecoCOMP began to offer computer and electronics service, cellphone repairs and data wipe/recovery, to mention a few of the services.

              Newer, Better Facilities!The original location proved to be less than ideal, which led to a search for a better location.  In November of 2013, a much better location was found at 785 Spencerport Road, Rochester.  Easy access, triple the space and visibility has definitely helped.  In addition to the store services, I am offering free classes to senior citizens, e-waste educational materials, free cellphone and electronics recycling drop off and local pick-up service.  We are also providing space for a local cultural dance company to practice, as well as various community classes offered locally.  The move was costly, yet it was necessary to provide the community with a much needed service.Why We Need Your Help:
Funds that were available to facilities like ecoCOMP are no longer available due to budget cuts.  Costs for processing e-waste for recycling have increased as a result.  To offset these added costs, I am expanding the service available on computers, cellphones, tablets, televisions, etc.  I am seeking funding to pay for classroom materials,  website launch, repair parts inventory, utility costs and facility upgrades to make the new location more energy efficient by upgrading the lighting, signage and windows.  Also needed are funds to repair the current van used for pick-up and transport.  Thank you for your time and kind consideration, as you read through my campaign.  If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at evan.e.snow@gmail.com.  Thank you for doing your part for the environment, every little bit will help us to save our environment!",11.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h4><h1><br/></h1><h1>Rangeland Solutions, Inc.<br/>
</h1><h3>Overview<br/>
</h3><p></p>
<p>Rangeland Solutions is an innovative social not-for-profit business with
the mission to provide sustainable income-generating opportunities to
pastoralists, by restoring the local ecosystem and utilizing better rangeland
and livestock management techniques to increase the productivity of the land
and livestock.</p>
<p>Working through community-based field staff, Rangeland
Solutions partners with pastoralist groups to provide them the resources,
training and support they need to implement Holistic Management, a ranch
planning system. This unique approach to rangeland management has been shown to
rehabilitate habitats by reducing overgrazing and erosion and enhancing natural
processes, thereby increasing land productivity and generating significantly
higher rates of beef production.</p>

Overall, this approach has the potential to
significantly improve the livelihoods of pastoralists, who are often some of
the poorest and most marginalized members of society, while reversing the
processes of desertification and climate change, which threaten our planet.<br/><br/><h3>Problem</h3><h2>
</h2><p>The livestock sector is
an important global player with significant and wide-ranging social, economic
and environmental impacts.  Worldwide,
livestock production provides livelihoods for 1 billion of the world’s poor.  However, the livestock sector is also a major
driver of deforestation, land degradation, pollution, climate change and
biodiversity loss.</p>
<p>Kenya is a clear
illustration of livestock’s complex social, economic and environmental
role.  In the Arid and Semi-Arid Lands
(ASALs) of Kenya, which constitute 80 percent of the country, the livestock
sector provides livelihoods for 95 percent of families and employs 10 million
people.  </p>
However, pastoralism in ASALs faces many
challenges.<span>  Population and livestock growth
has led to overgrazing, creating a negative-feedback system of environmental
degradation, reduced livestock yields and greater poverty.  In addition, pastoralists lack access to
capital, markets and extension services, such as veterinary care.  The lack of these services is a major
detriment to pastoralist income and livelihoods and inhibits market efficiency.</span><br/><br/><h3>Solution</h3><p>Holistic Management
(HM) is a Ranch Planning System that helps pastoralists better manage agricultural resources. In this system land is managed on a large-scale and the livestock are grazed in concentrated
groups, mimicking wild herds, within demarcated areas. The cattle are moved
daily, rotating through the landscape, allowing
previously grazed grass enough time to regenerate.</p><p>This form of
management is shown to rehabilitate habitats by reducing overgrazing and
erosion and enhancing natural processes, such as nutrient and water cycling.<span>  As a result, land
productivity increases, generating <u>higher beef production rates of up to 50
percent</u>, <u>and ROA up to 200 percent ; while sequestering carbon into the
soil at 0.1-5.3 T C · ha<sup>-1</sup> · yr<sup>-1</sup></u>(Roughly equivalent
to removing 1-2 cars off the road).</span></p><h3>Business Model</h3><p>Rangeland Solutions will be a social enterprise that engages pastoralists in the practice of
Holistic Management.<span>  Rangeland Solutions will become
involved in the value chain by providing needed services to small-scale
livestock producers, such as access to financing, livestock inputs, and
training.  In addition, Rangeland Solutions
will act as a transactional intermediary, helping small-scale pastoralists sell
their livestock into larger-scale commercial markets, thereby addressing the
missing market linkages between small producers and large-scale buyers.</span></p><p><span></span>In the initial phase,
Rangeland Solutions will work with community members to form Pastoralist
Production Groups (PPG).<span>  </span>Once formed, Rangeland Solutions will provide training on Holisitic Management, as well as build a waterhole for livestock and provide grass seeds for reseeding (<b><i>At no cost</i></b>).  Rangeland Solutions will
also help PPGs market their livestock as a group and sell them into
larger-scale commercial markets, providing pastoralists with better access to
terminal markets and higher prices.  As part of the arrangement, Rangeland Solutions will have the rights to raise cattle on the lands of the PPGs for five years, at no cost.  This approach allows Rangeland Solutions to make back its original investment, while turning a small profit.</p><p><b>Each PPG requires approximately $5,000 USD in initial investment to begin, or less than $500 per pastoralist family</b> (Dependent on number of families in each PPG)<br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h1>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h1><h4>What We Need<br/>
</h4><p>We are currently in the process of starting our first <b>pilot project</b>, which will act as our ""proof-of-concept"".  We plan on launching it
in Spring 2014, in the village of Olekimunke (100 km south of Nairobi), where
Rangeland Solutions previously conducted research and has established communal
ties.<span>  The pilot project will involve
forming one PPG, in which we hope to sign up 10-15 pastoral families.  This initial PPG will help Rangeland
Solutions to test our model and work out any issues.  In addition, it will be used as a
demonstration site for other pastoralists to see the intended outcomes and
benefits.</span></p><p>As mentioned above, it costs approximately <b>$5,000</b> to start each PPG, and we need your help to raise that amount. <b>You can donate any amount</b>.<br/></p><h4>What You Get In Return:</h4>Many of the pastoralists we work with are Maasai and we would like to share a bit of their culture with you.<br/><ul><li>

productivity increases, generating higher beef production rates of up to 50
percent, and ROA up to 200 percent ; while sequestering carbon into the
soil at 0.1-5.3 T C · ha-1 · yr-1(Roughly equivalent
to removing 1-2 cars off the road).Business ModelRangeland Solutions will be a social enterprise that engages pastoralists in the practice of
Holistic Management.  Rangeland Solutions will become
involved in the value chain by providing needed services to small-scale
livestock producers, such as access to financing, livestock inputs, and
training.  In addition, Rangeland Solutions
will act as a transactional intermediary, helping small-scale pastoralists sell
their livestock into larger-scale commercial markets, thereby addressing the
missing market linkages between small producers and large-scale buyers.In the initial phase,
Rangeland Solutions will work with community members to form Pastoralist
Production Groups (PPG).  Once formed, Rangeland Solutions will provide training on Holisitic Management, as well as build a waterhole for livestock and provide grass seeds for reseeding (At no cost).  Rangeland Solutions will
also help PPGs market their livestock as a group and sell them into
larger-scale commercial markets, providing pastoralists with better access to
terminal markets and higher prices.  As part of the arrangement, Rangeland Solutions will have the rights to raise cattle on the lands of the PPGs for five years, at no cost.  This approach allows Rangeland Solutions to make back its original investment, while turning a small profit.Each PPG requires approximately $5,000 USD in initial investment to begin, or less than $500 per pastoralist family (Dependent on number of families in each PPG)What We Need & What You GetWhat We Need
We are currently in the process of starting our first pilot project, which will act as our ""proof-of-concept"".  We plan on launching it
in Spring 2014, in the village of Olekimunke (100 km south of Nairobi), where
Rangeland Solutions previously conducted research and has established communal
ties.  The pilot project will involve
forming one PPG, in which we hope to sign up 10-15 pastoral families.  This initial PPG will help Rangeland
Solutions to test our model and work out any issues.  In addition, it will be used as a
demonstration site for other pastoralists to see the intended outcomes and
benefits.As mentioned above, it costs approximately $5,000 to start each PPG, and we need your help to raise that amount. You can donate any amount.What You Get In Return:Many of the pastoralists we work with are Maasai and we would like to share a bit of their culture with you.
Maasai Herder ($25): Receive a beautiful beaded bracelet, hand-crafted by Maasai women from the communities we work in.  These are wonderful items, worn by almost every Maasai person.          
Maasai Warrior ($75): Do you want to dress like a Maasai warrior? Of course you do.  At this level you will receive a traditional Maasai shuka, worn by warriors (Warani) during cold nights out in the bush.  This is a versatile piece of clothing that can be used as a blanket, towel or sweater.             
Maasai Elder ($150):  Receive a leather beaded belt, hand-crafted by Maasai women from the communities we work in.  This is a wonderful accessory to brighten up any outfit.         
Maasai Village Elder ($500): Help support a pastoralist family and receive all of the items listed above, plus a profile of the family you support (including photos).

Maasai Village Chief ($1,000): Help support two pastoralist families and receive all of the items listed above, including profiles of both families, as well as a ceremonial club (rungu). These are carried by elders to signify their status.

<p class=""p1"">I’m Arvin Pierce and welcome to my campaign! With your support we can truly Save More Bees!</p>
<p class=""p1"">You've read the articles and seen the news. The reports just keep coming in on how the bees are dying off. It's hard to figure out what you can do. Well, now you can truly help Save More Bees by donating directly to my campaign. </p>
<p class=""p1"">I've been a beekeeper for over 11 years. As a beekeeper, one of my main jobs is to rescue colonies or swarms of bees that have taken up residence in buildings, homes, trees etc. Often, people used to just spray the colony with insecticide and kill them, but with all the awareness about bee populations dying off, people have started to call me to Save More Bees. I get a lot of calls to collect colonies from barns, houses, churches and even trees. I place these colonies into a hive (woodenware) and relocate them to a farm, yard, etc. so they can continue pollinating our crops and flowers.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Unfortunately, I have run out of hives and I need many more.</p>
<p class=""p1"">I am asking for your support, so I can continue to Save More Bees. Let's remember that although this is my campaign, it is not about me...it is about the bees. </p>
<p class=""p1""> </p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>My History</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">11 years ago, my wife Colleen and I figured we’d “just get a couple of hives” to provide our own honey.  By the end of that first year we had 6 hives, and that number just kept increasing. As I began to learn more about honeybees, I became totally fascinated. My love of bees has grown and now I take care of numerous bee yards around Central Illinois with at least 70 hives.</p>
<p class=""p1"">After a few years of keeping bees, I started to get calls from folks who had bee colonies in their buildings or trees and wanted them removed. I’ve been known to drive over 100 miles to remove bees from people’s property. The folks who call me have also seen the reports about the declining bee populations and they want to Save More Bees as well. It seems that the more colonies I save, the more folks find out about what I do.  Often in the middle of doing one job, I receive calls about other colonies needing to be saved. The year isn’t even close to being over yet!</p>
<p class=""p1"">To date, I have 2 pest control companies that will call me instead of destroying honeybee colonies. I also have 2 tree trimmers who will contact me when they find a tree with bees. This doesn’t include the numerous swarms of bees I personally get called to retrieve. After these colonies are saved, I need to keep them in my apiary until they become established in a hive (woodenware). Then, the hive needs to be moved to a yard or farm where the benefits of these wonderful, fascinating pollinators can be appreciated and utilized. </p>
<p class=""p3""> </p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>What I Need</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">A few years ago, I was fortunate enough to purchase some used hives. Well, now those hives are completely used up. Things have become so bad that I’ve begun to piece together hives with scraps of wood or parts of old ones. I really need new hives (woodenware) and that includes the top covers, bottom boards, hive bodies, and frames. It doesn't stop there. I need so much more than just the hives themselves. I also have the cost of the maintenance of my equipment which includes; my bee vac, saws, scaffold, ladder, and numerous hand tools. I also have the miles traveled to the jobs and the miles moving the hives, which creates cost for fuel and maintenance of my vehicle. This ALL adds up. </p>
<p>Here is the breakdown.  I need 30 hives right now. On average, the hive and the equipment used (per rescue) runs $250. I've captured and removed a total of 22 colonies of bees so far this spring and early summer. These colonies are being kept in my yard in old, single-box hives and nucs (a nuc is half a box), with 3 of these colonies still in logs and one still in an old porch post. At this point in time there are 8 more bee colonies on my list to save. These bees will all need to be put in full-size hives to be relocated and become beneficial colonies.  With all the calls coming in, these rescues just don’t end. They keep coming and coming and we need to Save More Bees. They are simply too important to lose.</p>
<p>So it looks like this:</p>
<p>Right now, I need...</p>
<p class=""p3"">30 hives @ $250 each = $7500 </p>
<p class=""p3"">That's 30 colonies that we saved from extermination and placed on farms or in yards. But remember, the more you give the more bees I can save.</p>
<p class=""p3""> </p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>What You Get</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">I need your support to be able to continue to Save More Bees. In exchange for your donations I am offering many different exciting rewards!</p>

<p class=""p3""> </p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Bees are an integral part of our eco-system and much needed pollinators. We need to be saving as many bees as possible. With the increase in the number of hives that I save, I can continue to increase the awareness in treatment-free bees and promote healthy beekeeping practices, while increasing the availability of raw, natural honey. But the greatest reward you can get…is knowing that you and I are Saving More Bees.   </p>
<p class=""p1"">Please pick a level you can afford and donate now. If you can't afford to donate money, that's ok too. Please help us by spreading the word; post this site on Facebook walls, Twitter and through other social media. Indiegogo has some easy and efficient social networking tools!!!

Unfortunately, I have run out of hives and I need many more.
I am asking for your support, so I can continue to Save More Bees. Let's remember that although this is my campaign, it is not about me...it is about the bees. 
 
My History
11 years ago, my wife Colleen and I figured we’d “just get a couple of hives” to provide our own honey.  By the end of that first year we had 6 hives, and that number just kept increasing. As I began to learn more about honeybees, I became totally fascinated.

Then, the hive needs to be moved to a yard or farm where the benefits of these wonderful, fascinating pollinators can be appreciated and utilized. 
 
What I Need
A few years ago, I was fortunate enough to purchase some used hives. Well, now those hives are completely used up. Things have become so bad that I’ve begun to piece together hives with scraps of wood or parts of old ones. I really need new hives (woodenware) and that includes the top covers, bottom boards, hive bodies, and frames. It doesn't stop there. I need so much more than just the hives themselves. I also have the cost of the maintenance of my equipment which includes; my bee vac, saws, scaffold, ladder, and numerous hand tools. I also have the miles traveled to the jobs and the miles moving the hives, which creates cost for fuel and maintenance of my vehicle. This ALL adds up. 
Here is the breakdown.  I need 30 hives right now. On average, the hive and the equipment used (per rescue) runs $250. I've captured and removed a total of 22 colonies of bees so far this spring and early summer. These colonies are being kept in my yard in old, single-box hives and nucs (a nuc is half a box), with 3 of these colonies still in logs and one still in an old porch post. At this point in time there are 8 more bee colonies on my list to save. These bees will all need to be put in full-size hives to be relocated and become beneficial colonies.  With all the calls coming in, these rescues just don’t end. They keep coming and coming and we need to Save More Bees. They are simply too important to lose.
So it looks like this:
Right now, I need...
30 hives @ $250 each = $7500 
That's 30 colonies that we saved from extermination and placed on farms or in yards. But remember, the more you give the more bees I can save.

The Fair pools collective creative potential and will curate from submissions a virtual exhibit/gallery online as well as a traveling exhibit to attend fairs, festivals, farmers markets, and other occassions as invited or as possible. This project will produce a  compilation book featuring artwork and writing that envision the change we want to see in the world and a compilation album featuring songs around the same theme. Both are offered as rewards for this Indiegogo drive. In addition, a traveling exhibit will be constructed to exhibit creative contributions and promote the book and album. Additional rewards include prints of artwork donated to this effort and the ability to host the Rainbow Nation exhibit in your community.ABOUT THE PROJECT INITIATOR22 Years an Earth Activist Hi, my name is Reya. I started a Kids for Saving the Earth club on my school playground at age 10. I am about to turn 32 and in these 22 years I have dedicated my heart energy to a variety of causes on this path. I would like to share with you details of my journey and work on this path to illustrate my commitment and dedication to this mission and my ability to organize and execute complex projects. And so, I have expanded on my story at the bottom if you scroll down so you don't get bogged down in my story before learning about the project. (SCROLL TO BOTTOM FOR MORE OF MY STORY...)WHAT IS RAINBOW NATION?Rainbow Nation is one of five facets of Rainbow Camp's work.
Rainbow Nation: Uniting creatives to dream a new world.

Model Sustainability Camp: Demonstrating how a small group of people can come together to share and create abundance and support for all.

Trail of Food: Propagating, Planning, Planting, and caring for food forests in the surrounding community.

Giving Corp: A service-oriented camp for youth teaching self reliance skills, teamwork and group communication skills, permaculture, and natural building. The Corp assists in maintaining the Trail of Food project and the free children's summer camps.

Kids Summer Camps: Free to area children, summer camps offer nature immersion and exploration on 160 acres of forested land that backs up to over 1,000 acres of public lands and trails including a limestone cave. Camp will also engage area youth in the Trail of Food and permaculture practice.

Rainbow Nation is the first project we are launching because the dream is where it starts. If we can envision the world we want to create, we will create it!

HOW THIS PROJECT CAN (LITERALLY) REINVENT THE WORLD
Quantum physics has helped illuminate how our thoughts impact the world around us. The biggest secret is the law of attraction. What we think, what we envision, what we pray for is what we attract into our lives. Our thoughts create our reality.With this knowledge we have a great responsibility and great opportunity to dream the world we all know is possible. If enough of us combine our creative intent on the question: What does a peaceful harmonious world look like? imagine the ripples we can create!There are plenty of experiments and stories that have emerged to illustrate this important once-supressed secret. From Emoto's photographs of water molecules subjected to words and prayer, to the 100th monkey phenomenon...With this new understanding of the nature of reality, we are free to stop living a story we know is toxic, and dream a new one to replace it. This work is already being undertaken by Rainbow Warriors and creative pioneers worldwide such as Sacha Stone with the New Earth Project and permaculturists worldwide. But just as it takes a village to raise a child, it will take a village to raise the collective vibration and enter the world of our dreams. This is the rationale for Rainbow Nation - gathering collective creative potential to unite people around a shared vision for a healthy free harmonious Earth.Rainbow Nation will create the following tangibles:
Compilation Book: Revolution Blueprint: Collective dreams to heal the world

Compilation Album: Dreaming New Earth

Virtual Exhibit online at RainbowNation.com

Traveling Exhibit to promote book, Revolution Blueprint and Album Dreaming New Earth and exhibit collection of creative visions.

Kids Collective Mural: In April Rainbow Camp will work with children at the Dome School to create a collective artistic representation of a healthy abundant world.

What We Need & What You GetHere are the bare expenses needed to make Rainbow Nation a success. The bulk of the budget is to provide modest stipends to selected artist/creative contributors. This is both fair practice and will help attract quality submissions to the project by set deadlines. $15,000 of $26,908 budget goes towards contributor stipends. $3,000 goes for stipends to master the album and layout/design the book. $2,700 goes to compensate performers and support for the exhibit launch April 19, 2014 in honor of the 44th Earth Day (April 22, 2014). $2,364 goes toward building the live exhibit and booth fees for events where the exhibit will go. $650 goes to purchasing art supplies for working with school children on collective art that will contribute to this exhibit.

Additional funding from this campaign would be directed toward:
EXHIBIT: Gas money to travel to events.
EXHIBIT: Truck rental: We would rent a truck from a neighbor to transport exhibit to events.
PROJECT COORDINATION: My time is as a volunteer for this effort. Additional funding would allow me to take a small stipend to support our land payments and livelihood at Rainbow Camp.
PRODUCTION: Additional resources may be directed towards better production of the compilation book and album.
If we do not reach our funding goal we will reduce the value of stipends offered to contributors and make cuts to production stipends. The Rainbow Nation solicitation does not mention stipends so achieving funding for the project will make these stipends possible and help raise the bar for contributions.Take Part in Collectively Dreaming New Earth

ABOUT THE PROJECT INITIATOR
22 Years an Earth Activist Hi, my name is Reya. My legal name is Kristen Steele. As a kid my classmates called me Smiley (because they said I never stopped smiling) and I've also been known by the forest name Dandi. I started a Kids for Saving the Earth club on my school playground at age 10. I am about to turn 32 and in these 22 years I have dedicated my heart energy to a variety of causes on this path.
After a few years of extensive research into animal testing and the food industry, I became vegetarian at age 14 and volunteered with Earth Save in my hometown of Louisville, KY. I went on to attend College of Charleston in South Carolina where I was a campus and community organizer. I worked with and led the student organizations Alliance for Planet Earth and Womyn's Forum on a number of campaigns, events, and actions. I attended the National Conference on Organized Resistance from 2003-2005 and a numerous marches and organized protests in Washington, DC and throughout the U.S. I've marched for Women's Rights, protested the KKK, protested the World Bank, protested the Free Trade Area of the Americas, protested genetically modified organisms, protested the war, protested nuclear power, and protested electronic waste alongside thousands of sisters and brother warriors. In 2002 I co-created a new community garden and began growing food and plants wherever I could. In 2003 I began forest defense training and sat in a tree for 45 days as part of an Earth First! campaign. I participated in two mission-driven multi-state bicycle tours around this time. 


 
In 2003 I participated in the Flying Rutabega Cycle Circus Caravan Across the Cornbelt raising awareness of the risks of GMO food. (That's me with the One Less Car shirt).

Focusing on People Powered MovementUpon returning from my activism tour, I created Charleston Cycle Fest, a week long celebration of bicycling which included a community-generated bicycle art show, an outdoor  bicycle film festival, kids bicycle rodeo, community bike ride, and bicycle maintenance and touring workshops which I organized for two years. The success and publicity generated by this event led to co-founding the nonprofit Charleston Moves and becoming active in the international bicycle and pedestrian advocacy movement. This marked a shift in my activist work away from protests and anti- messaging and towards positive solution-oriented advocacy. I attended the National Bike Summit in Washington, DC every March from 2005-2010 where I participated in lobbying for more federal transportation money to  create healthy safe places for biking and walking. 


In 2009 with sleeping baby in Senate building Washington, DC lobbying for biking and walking.

In 2006 I moved from South Carolina to San Francisco, CA where I met my ex-husband who is an artist and long-time bicycle advocate and co-founded Critical Mass. 
In January 2007 began working for the Alliance for Biking and Walking (then Thunderhead Alliance), the North American coalition of grassroots bicycling and walking advocacy organizations.



In 2008 co-leading a Winning Campaigns training for biking and walking advocates in hometown of Louisville, KY.
 I worked with the Alliance for 6 years where I lead a research project funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and published 3 biennial benchmarking reports that compiled data from the 50 states and 50 largest U.S. cities. 
Publishing and Visual Communications
I also led the Alliance's communication efforts including a renaming and rebranding process, website redesign, and building a resource library with thousands of resources for member groups. While with the Alliance I created the People Powered Movement Photo Contest which attracted thousands of photo submissions worldwide and partnered with a number of media and other businesses to promote and offer contest prizes.


       In 2010 created the People Powered Movement Photo Contest
In 2009 I began writing for Momentum Magazine (Vancouver, BC) and eventually began writing the column ""The Advocate""  I have also published in Earth First! Journal, Carbusters and here, Fit and Sport (South Carolina), and Public Sector Digest. I was the primary author and designer of the 2007, 2010, and 2012 versions of the 100+ page research report Bicycling and Walking in the United States. I co-authored, designed, and edited the Alliance for Biking & Walking's Guide to Fundraising Rides and Guide to Complete Streets Campaigns. I wrote two chapters for the book On Bicycles



    Some of the publications I have contributed to, authored, and designed.
Transition to Permaculture PathIn 2008 the focus of my heart work began to shift. My son Axel was born and I began self-directed study in permaculture starting with Gaia's Garden. In 2009 I took my first natural building course with Pat Hennebery of Cobworks and began designing a cob house with my then partner. 


    2009 at Natural Building Workshop with Pat Hennebery and son Axel.

In 2009 and 2010 we prepared the site and met Michael G. Smith of Emerald Earth who agreed to consult with us on the project. In 2010 my daughter Ayla was born and we moved to the rural Humboldt County location and began building a home of natural materials.

In 2011 and 2012 Sustainability School hosted two natural building workshops with Smith and hosted 100 people through these workshops, Worldwide Opportunities on Organic Farms, and Workaway. 


  Becky and Myles, two of our amazing volunteers with the project.
 also created the blog Muddy Hands to chronicle the natural home building process.

Transitions, Evolution, and MovesIn 2012 I left my ex-partner and father of my two young children and the land we had shared. He had bought the property before we joined and sharing it proved unhealthy for us all, so I moved in search of a new home to continue life and work with my then 2 and 4 year old. This search for a new place coincided with an evolution of the Sustainability School project into what is now Rainbow Camp, a spirit-centered nature awareness and self reliance skills camp and research center for low-cost energyt-efficient technologies that promote freedom and preserve Earth's resources for the next seven generations.After nearly 18 months of searching I signed for 160 acres of rural forested land in Southern Oregon and relocated to this land with my two children, cat, and converted school bus.

I am a junior at Pitzer College, one of the Claremont Colleges outside Los Angeles, California. I am studying Environmental Analysis and Social Development through Sports. I grew up in Chicago, Illinois and have been an avid soccer player since I could walk. I have played soccer competitively throughout my childhood and have continued to play in college. It was not until college that I realized the power of the game.  It is a universal language that connects all corners of the globe.  Throughout my work with StreetSoccerUSA and other development programs I have begun to see the power the sport can have on people’s lives.  Indeed sport has the power to change the world, to inspire, to unite people in a way that little else can.</p>
<p><strong>TakaBin Project</strong></p>
<p><strong>Takataka Yetu Jukumu Langu.</strong><br/><strong>Our Trash, My Responsibility.</strong><br/> <br/>Throughout my time in the Eastlands of Nairobi I have noticed one ongoing challenge- trash. During the 1990’s the city discontinued regular trash collection. This led to an area wide crisis, trash began to pile up on the road sides and the people were left no other option than to burn their trash which resulted in harmful chemicals released into their neighborhoods. Many families of five or more adults and children live in small shacks about three meters squared. The homes are made of mud, sticks, cardboard and flattened tins. The homes have no water, no electricity, no toilets, no garbage collection and no sewage lines.  The homes are not built to harness the natural world – rainwater usually pours through the roofs and walls. Even on sunny days it is too dark to read or do schoolwork inside. Overpopulation and underdevelopment has led to the spread of diseases. There is no proper sewage system, which leads to human waste being improperly disposed. When the rain season strikes garbage as well as human waste enters people’s homes. Most of the trash collection today is run by youth initiatives and private businesses. These small run trash collections require weekly payment from the different homes and communities. Many of residents of Mathare work in the industrial area where they provide manual labor which earns them a little more than $ 3 a day. Due to the severe poverty in the areas most people cannot afford trash collection when money is so pinched they can barely manage to put food on the table. Despite the issues in policy I think the main problem lies on the youth’s mindset towards nature. The natural world in the slums is tainted by human waste and overpopulation. The river is sandwiched between piles of plastic bags, and the few trees are layered with thick brown dust from the roads.</p>
<p>I am beginning the piloting phase of the TakaBin Project. Our motto is:<strong> Our Trash, My Responsibility.</strong> We hope this makes each individual be accountable for the litter in their community. There might be huge communal piles of trash in the streets but it is up to the individual to insure that it is properly disposed. The project not only will reduce the amount of trash surrounding schools but will hopefully alter the minds of the schoolchildren. I plan to construct permanent large metal trash bins. The bins will be rationed off into three sections- food waste, recyclables, and paper. They will be built locally in Nairobi.  The aim of this will be to give value to their ‘trash’. Not only will we implant the trash bins but we will deliver workshops in the classrooms as well. With the combined impact of the physical separation of trash and the environmental curriculum I hope the youth change their perception of the natural world. The goal would be that the schoolchildren retain the lessons and diffuse the message into their families and greater communities.</p>
<p>We will implement this project throughout the various slum communities of MYSA. The large bins will be strategically placed depending on the various community needs. Workshops and tree planting will accompany each bin’s introduction into the community. We hope to create sustainable change instead of quick solutions such as burning trash or illegally dumping waste on the road side.</p>
<p><strong>What happens when the bins are full?</strong></p>
<p>We have appointed field coordinators in each community that the bins will be placed in. The collection varies among the locations. Thus far we have confirmed that the bins will be implanted in Maili Saba, Mathare, and Kayole. Since there is no government assistance the collection is done by the community. In Mathare we have partnered with a local environmental group, The Mathare Environment Conservation Youth Group,  that will be in charge of the bins once they are installed. They will be watering the newly planted seedlings, emptying and washing the bins, as well as monitoring them. In Maili Saba we have partnered with local schools. The schools will be in charge of developing a collection system. This same structure we have put in place in Kayole. They will then transport the garbage to a legal dump site.</p>
<p>“Waste is not waste until it's wasted.” We also encourage the different groups we are working with to use the collected trash in an environmentally sound manner. The collected items can be used as revenue for themselves, as well as support for the varying community initiatives. We have visited local recycling projects that use plastic bags to make handbags, plastic water bottles to make furniture and even animal bones to make jewelry. 'Trash' has value!</p>
<p>This project we hope will not only help the community get much needed resources but also ensure there is a sense of responsibility and ownership for the project.</p>
<p><strong>Budget:</strong></p>
<p>Bin- $300.00 each</p>
<p>Transport for the Bin- $25.00</p>
<p>Seedings- $20.00 each</p>
<p>Curriculum material- $100.00</p>
<p>We see this as an opportunity to complement what MYSA is doing with slum clean up activities as well as create a more environmentally sustainable solution. This approach will help deal with the excessive amount of garbage in Eastlands, which is over 2,000 tons per day. Findings suggest that there are severe public health and environmental impacts because of this.</p>
<p>Any amount can help us accomplish our goal of implementing this project in at least three communities. Your money will go directly to the construction of the bins and the seedlings for the schools and communities. We hope to put at least three bins in each community. The more money we raise, the more bins we can make! As simple as that.</p>

<p><strong>Mathar</strong><strong>e Youth Sports Association </strong><br/>I have been working at Mathare Youth Sports Association for a month. MYSA is a local non-profit that links sports with environmental cleanups, AIDS prevention, leadership training and other community service activities. Currently over 25,000 youths from 16 different slum communities are active members of this organization. MYSA is a global pioneer in linking sports with social and community development activities. I specifically focus on the organization’s activities in community service and public outreaches, its significant success in creating opportunities for women’s involvement in sport, and its interactions with the government. MYSA provides crucial lessons for the youth development in Kenya by harnessing spirit of volunteerism, its holistic approach to development, its innovative use of sports, and its emphasis on youth leadership. </p>
<p><strong>What does MYSA do?</strong></p>
<p>MYSA is the largest self- help youth sports and community service organization in Africa. The Mathare area is one of the largest and poorest slums in Africa and home for over half a million people.</p>
<p>MYSA organizes a wide range of self-help youth sports and community<br/>development activities. Highlights include:</p>
<p><strong>Involving youth in development:</strong> Although youth are over half the population in Mathare, Kenya and Africa, their many needs, concerns and talents are often neglected. The main goal and motto of MYSA is to “Give youth a sporting chance” to help themselves and their community. Their longer term goal is to help develop the leadership skills and leaders needed to accelerate sustainable development in Kenya.</p>
<p><strong>Linking sport and environmental cleanup:</strong>  MYSA is based on the simple fact that every football team is also a ""mobilized"" youth group. Our boys and girls teams play matches but also carry out a wide range of environmental cleanup and other self-help community service activities.</p>
<p><strong>Reducing disease and deaths in the slums:</strong> Uncollected garbage and blocked drainage ditches are major causes of disease, disability and deaths in Mathare. The greatest threat is during the seasonal rains when water contaminated by garbage and human waste floods around and even into homes. So the youth carry out weekly garbage and drainage ditch cleanup projects. Teams earn six points in the league standings for each completed cleanup project.</p>
<p><strong>Tackling the AIDS threat:</strong> Poverty and ignorance are major causes of AIDS. Like many slums, Mathare is a high risk area. Hundreds of Mathare youth leaders between 13-20 years of age have been trained on AIDS prevention and peer counseling. As the new heroes and role models in the slums, the best players are also the best way to reach many other youth with crucial information on AIDS risks and prevention.</p>
<p><strong>Reducing substance abuse:</strong> To blur the edges of their tough lives, too many youth sniff glue and petrol or abuse drugs and alcohol. A top priority in MYSA is to give footballs to every team so they can train regularly. That helps many to stop abusing drugs because of peer pressure from teammates to keep fit.</p>
<p><strong>Helping young leaders stay in school:</strong> Due to their large families and desperate poverty, many youth are forced to leave school. Under the MYSA Leadership Awards Project, the youth earn points for their achievements in different sports and community service activities. Over 450 awards are now made annually to help the best young leaders stay in school. The awards are paid directly to their school.</p>
<p><strong>Helping youth excel in school:</strong> Without electricity, even at noon it is too dark to read inside homes in Mathare. Also, few local schools have libraries. MYSA has now created small libraries and study halls in four MYSA zones which are used by local schools on weekdays and by our own members after school and on weekends. They are so popular that we now aim to create one in each of the other 12 MYSA zones.</p>
<p><strong>Encouraging young artistic talents:</strong> Our programs include training youth in dancing, drumming and singing as well as drama and puppetry. Their performances highlight key social issues such as AIDS, drug and alcohol abuse. Since 2004 MYSA’s youth have performed at the annual Haugesund Children's Festivals in Norway.</p>
<p><strong>Helping disabled kids:</strong> MYSA organizes special sports, music and other activities for kids with mental and/or physical disabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Helping jailed kids:</strong> Over a hundred streetkids from 4-16 years old were being processed weekly at the Juvenile Court. In cooperation with local authorities, MYSA helped renovate the court facilities and also feed and interview the kids. Our staff help contact and return jailed kids to their families and then link their families with microfinance programs.</p>
<p><strong>Changing gender attitudes:</strong> Traditional views of men toward women and of women about themselves are serious constraints on social and political development. Both views changed among the Mathare youth since the mid-1990s with the rapid success of the girls’ teams in Kenya and abroad and the integration of girls in our decision-making committees and staff. Half of all elected MYSA leaders are girls, including the elected chair of the overall MYSA Executive Council.</p>
<p><strong>Practicing good governance and accountability:</strong> MYSA is owned and run by the youth. In the 16 MYSA zones, key decisions are made by locally elected youth leaders. The best leaders are elected to the overall MYSA executive bodies. The average age of our several hundred MYSA volunteer organizers, leaders, coaches and referees is 15-16 years. Our accounts are independently audited every year.</p>
<p><strong>Expanding horizons and hopes:</strong> Through their many achievements on and off the field our youth acquire new self-esteem and confidence. Over 1,000 MYSA youth have participated in the Norway Cup and youth tournaments in Holland. The youth lived there with host families and returned home with new views about themselves, the world and their future. Many of our best leaders are Norway Cup graduates. Others have earned diplomas or are still pursuing advanced studies in accounting, business administration, criminal justice administration, computer programming and medicine.</p>
<p><strong>Creating new role models:</strong> As too many fathers neglect or abandon their families, the survival of many kids depends on their hardworking mothers. Lacking other role models, the top players, coaches and youth leaders in MYSA have become the new heroes and role models for the youth in Mathare and for millions of youth in other poor urban and rural communities in Kenya.</p>
<p><strong>Changing public images of slums:</strong> When MYSA started our youth rarely admitted being from Mathare because of the bad and unfair image of the slums. The print and TV news reports about MYSA achievements on and off the field helped change those attitudes in and outside Kenya. So do the many remarkable photographs on their lives and living conditions taken and published by the youth in the MYSA “Shootback” photography training project.</p>
<p><strong>Building and maintaining communal peace:</strong> The MYSA leaders, youth and programs help reduce inter-ethnic tensions and promote reconciliation and peace in the slums, especially during the outbreaks of inter-ethnic conflict in late 2006 and the post-election violence in early 2008. MYSA also initiated the innovative youth sports for development and peace project in the huge Kakuma Refugee Camp in northwest Kenya.</p>
<p><strong>Changing distorted images of Africa:</strong> Drought, famine, corruption and war too often dominate news reports on Africa. That distorts reality as the poor majority of people in Africa are peaceful, honest, hardworking and young. Projects like MYSA and the youth exchanges with host families in Norway and Holland help change distorted attitudes and images about the poor and slums in Africa.</p></div>","My name is Lilli Barrett-O’Keefe.

<p>The US Department of Energy Solar Decathlon is an award-winning program that challenges twenty teams from Universitites across the world to compete against each other. The purpose of this competition is to educate student participants and the public about the many cost-saving opportunities presented by clean-energy products. Ecohabit is the name of our cost-effective; energy-efficient, solar-powered home designed and build by students across a variety of majors at Stevens Institute of Technology. By using out uniquely decided smart technology, our house evolves over time, adapting to its users, and their lifestyles, and is some sense gets better with age.</p>
<p>Stevens was <strong>1 of only 20 teams chosen to compete at the 2013 Solar Decathlon competition</strong>. This provides clear evidence of our motivation and willingness to take risks and achieve success in solar technology and innovation. With your help and our team’s dedication we plan on bringing home a 1st place finish to Stevens in addition to donating the home to a United States Veteran. </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Any contribution would help us out greatly! From 2x4's to build the home, energy-efficient appliances, decorations to cash. We would be more than happy to receive anything that can help us impress the judges at the competition in Irvine, California.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>The impact of this project is huge not only to us students, but to the public and the family we donate Ecohabit to. Our entire school is behind Ecohabit and we are very proud that our team has been selected out of hundreds to compete. As students we are provided with unique training that prepares us to enter our nation’s clean-energy workforce. Additionally, through our marketing effort we are addressing the public about the opportunities that clean-energy products present. Finally, we are most excited about the final step- the donation process. In the last Solar Decathlon competition, our team joined with Habitat for Humanity and donated the home to a needy family in Washington DC. This time around, we plan on teaming up with the mayors office in San Diego, California to donate the home to a well-deserved United States Veteran.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Considering this is our second time competing in this competition, our team hopes to make as much noise about Ecohabit and the competition as possible. We are very confident in our design and think this is the year we can bring home the 1st place finish with your help!</p>

The US Department of Energy Solar Decathlon is an award-winning program that challenges twenty teams from Universitites across the world to compete against each other. The purpose of this competition is to educate student participants and the public about the many cost-saving opportunities presented by clean-energy products. Ecohabit is the name of our cost-effective; energy-efficient, solar-powered home designed and build by students across a variety of majors at Stevens Institute of Technology. By using out uniquely decided smart technology, our house evolves over time, adapting to its users, and their lifestyles, and is some sense gets better with age.
Stevens was 1 of only 20 teams chosen to compete at the 2013 Solar Decathlon competition. This provides clear evidence of our motivation and willingness to take risks and achieve success in solar technology and innovation. With your help and our team’s dedication we plan on bringing home a 1st place finish to Stevens in addition to donating the home to a United States Veteran. 
What We Need & What You Get
Any contribution would help us out greatly! From 2x4's to build the home, energy-efficient appliances, decorations to cash. We would be more than happy to receive anything that can help us impress the judges at the competition in Irvine, California.
The Impact
The impact of this project is huge not only to us students, but to the public and the family we donate Ecohabit to. Our entire school is behind Ecohabit and we are very proud that our team has been selected out of hundreds to compete. As students we are provided with unique training that prepares us to enter our nation’s clean-energy workforce. Additionally, through our marketing effort we are addressing the public about the opportunities that clean-energy products present. Finally, we are most excited about the final step- the donation process. In the last Solar Decathlon competition, our team joined with Habitat for Humanity and donated the home to a needy family in Washington DC. This time around, we plan on teaming up with the mayors office in San Diego, California to donate the home to a well-deserved United States Veteran.
Other Ways You Can Help
Considering this is our second time competing in this competition, our team hopes to make as much noise about Ecohabit and the competition as possible. We are very confident in our design and think this is the year we can bring home the 1st place finish with your help!

<h3><em>Update: Prices for group flights are now in. Unfortunately their estimates were quite under the actual cost. See below for new cost info.<br/></em></h3>
<h3><em> </em></h3>
<h3><em>Update: They've placed me in Thailand on June 20th! I'm beyond excited, and an so happy with everyone's support so far!</em></h3>
<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>My name is Heather Topple. I'm a biology/music student at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Ever since I was little, I've been fascinated by nature; whether it was treking through the backyard on the lookout for chickadees or at the beach with my sisters, convinced the whitecaps off in the distance were pods of whales.</p>
<h3>The Opportunity</h3>
<p>Through school, I've learned how important wildlife conservation is, and now I have the opportunity to give my time, talents, and compassion to make a difference. Through International Student Volunteers (ISV), I have been selected to volunteer abroad in a 4-week program this summer in Thailand!</p>
<p>Through this program, I'll be able to help build houses in communities, teach English to local children, and interact with the local wildlife in sanctuaries and reserves. I'm really excited for the opportunity to work with elephants, hence the name of my campaign. As a full-time student and part-time brewery tour supervisor, I understand the value of money, and need to find ways to pay for this truly once-in-a-lifetime experience.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Cost</h3>
</div>
<div>The cost of this program is around $6115, which breaks down into the following:</div>
<p>Program cost.................... $3795<br/> International airfare........... $1345 -&gt; $1499<br/> Airline tax/fuel.................... $550 -&gt; $750<br/> Domestic airfare.................. $350 -&gt; $435<br/> Ticketing fee......................... $25 -&gt; $30<br/> Academic credit fee................ $50<br/> Travel insurance.................... TBA<br/> Passport............................... TBA<br/> Vaccinations..........................

<div>
<h3>My Gift to You</h3>
<p>Given the scope of the program, these costs make sense. As a thank-you for your contribution, there are a few perks involved! For contributions of $10, I will give a special crochet elephant (pictured). $25 donors will receive a personalized thank-you and an elephant of their prefered colour. Those who contribute $50 will receive a personalized thank-you and a selection of photos from the trip. Those who contribute $100 will receive a personalized thank-you and a travel diary from the trip, including a selection of photos.</p>
<p>As a result of shipping costs, those of you who are donating out-of-province/country will not receive an elephant, but may choose whichever of the other perks as a substitute.</p>
<h3>How Does This Help?</h3>
</div>
<div>The ISV program has been organizing these volunteer efforts for almost 30 years. In that time, they've clocked over 220000 hours of volunteer work in six different countries, protected and relocatetd 8570 engangered sea turtle eggs, and spent over 27500 hours teaching music, English, conservation, recreation, &amp; health programs to over 4100 children.</div>

<h3>What You Can Do</h3>
<p>Not everyone is in a position to help out financially, but that's okay! Please, if you can, spread the word. Tell friends, family, post this site on facebook, show someone a photo of the elephants, do an interpretive dance explaining the cause - whatever you feel to help get the word out there. You never know who of your friends may feel inclined to donate!</p>

WHO ARE WE? 
Hi, I'm Abra! I am the Program Guide of Reinventing Roots, a permaculture certification and design program in the indigenous Bedouin village of Kaser al-Ser, Israel. With local residents and our volunteer team of talented teachers, builders, students, farmers and scientists, we are developing an education center in Kaser al-Ser that, through a unified community effort, will provide a means of income for the village's residents and basic infrastructures the village needs. Visitors will learn best practices for sustainable building and agriculture from Bedouin residents and our certified instructors.
WHO DO WE SERVE?

Bedouin villages in
Israel often lack basic public services, such as paved roads, electricity, community
centers and play areas, trash and sewage disposal services, schools and public
transportation. These gaps are the results of a longstanding conflict between
the State and the Bedouin over the use and ownership of the Negev Desert.
While the State has ruled that Bedouin must live in urban

Reinventing Roots empowers Bedouin citizens to live a life of their choosing, in accordance with their lands and traditions, and to pass on their invaluable knowledge of living with the natural environment.
HOW FAR CAN YOUR DONATION GO?
Your support will enable us to run our summer session, this July 5-August 6 in the Bedouin village of Kaser al-Ser. We need financial support to buy the basics to build our education center, gardens, farms and playgrounds with our local community.  
Here's an idea of how far a couple of dollars (or shekels) can go:


$2: 2-liter bottle of drinking water


$6: Trowel to tend community garden


$6.50: Round-trip bus ticket to Beer Sheva to pick up supplies


$19.50: Pitchfork to build small-scale agriculture


$23.00: Soccer ball for soccer lessons and break times


$100.00: Tarp to shade playground to protect students from hot, desert sun

<p><span>Bob North here, founder and president of the non-profit Living Earth Oases Project which was started to develop reforestation, conservation and agroforestry/permaculture projects in order to save our planet's remaining rainforest. Our goal will be to boost food production efficiency in rainforest habitats eliminating the need for the slash and burn method currently used by subsistence farmers eking out a living in tropical forest across the globe. Slash and burn is a main driver of deforestation and responsible for millions of acres of lost rainforest presenting an urgent need for solutions to this ongoing and growing dilemma. We feel we've developed several working solutions to address the aforementioned problems resulting in mass deforestation but were lacking funding to develop and implement those solutions, but thanks to a very generous donor we are on the verge of resolving our fundraising problem.</span></p>
<p>Our non-profit, Living Earth Oases Project will finally be in a position to establish our first Agroforestry project thanks to that very generous donor who recently donated one of his properties to us here in Baltimore in need of renovation. I have an extensive background and experience spanning decades with the restoration, remodeling and renovation of properties so this gift of a property in need of renovation was perfect for us as a project for seed money funding. Work on the renovation of the house has already begun and it's well on it's way to completion but we have fallen behind on our planned completion date do to illness and a few other unforeseen problems that have forced us to reach out to secure more funding to complete the renovations within a reasonable time frame that will allow for marketing the house and then setting up our agroforestry project before the end of the year. I've been able to donate much of the materials used to this point as well as do the work. Most of the materials used to this point are from previous jobs and along with being able to preserve a lot of the home's original architectural features like the fireplace mantle, refinishing flooring and steps, saving old doors and hardware and so on we've managed the material cost without to much hardship. Once the renovations are completed we will sell the property and invest part of the proceeds earned from the sale toward our agroforestry project in Costa Rica and budget the remainder toward another renovation project here in Baltimore to repeat the process of renovating and selling local properties to continue our fundraising efforts into next year. Before we can move forward on to our primary goal and mission of saving our planet's remaining rainforest we need your help in raising the remainder of the funds needed to complete the renovations on our donated property.</p>
<p>We are so close and feel that if we can raise $3500 we will be able to get the house finished by the end of July and on the Market. The money will help with hiring an electrician to do some minor work like installing a new light fixture in the kitchen and replacing old lights with new ones, eight in all as well as replacing a few receptacles and switches. We still need to do yard work, replace fencing, purchase new refrigerator and stove and find used base cabinets we can refinish at the Loading Dock or the Restore that will work with the upper cabinets we were able to save and we have some paint but need more so we are reaching out for more funding but we are giving back with great perks in return for your help. Our perks are pretty cool, like our T-shirts with our original logo, our wildflower and Milkweed seeds which will present the opportunity for you to enjoy beautiful flowers while giving a second time, this time to nature by helping to save the Monarch Butterfly and other pollinators, and then there is our Children's books that were written by Baltimore legend Lucretia (Lu) Fisher who helped save both Fells Point and Federal Hill from the wrecking ball by helping to stop a planned Highway Project back in the 70's and there are beautiful Art Prints and other great perks to choose from. These wonderful perks will be our way of giving back to you for your generosity. Please help us in our efforts and our quest to find solutions to deforestation while helping subsistence farming communities improve their lives all while helping to save our Planet's Remaining Rainforest and the creatures that call the rainforest home.</p><br/></div>","Our Story

Most of the materials used to this point are from previous jobs and along with being able to preserve a lot of the home's original architectural features like the fireplace mantle, refinishing flooring and steps, saving old doors and hardware and so on we've managed the material cost without to much hardship. Once the renovations are completed we will sell the property and invest part of the proceeds earned from the sale toward our agroforestry project in Costa Rica and budget the remainder toward another renovation project here in Baltimore to repeat the process of renovating and selling local properties to continue our fundraising efforts into next year. Before we can move forward on to our primary goal and mission of saving our planet's remaining rainforest we need your help in raising the remainder of the funds needed to complete the renovations on our donated property.
We are so close and feel that if we can raise $3500 we will be able to get the house finished by the end of July and on the Market. The money will help with hiring an electrician to do some minor work like installing a new light fixture in the kitchen and replacing old lights with new ones, eight in all as well as replacing a few receptacles and switches. We still need to do yard work, replace fencing, purchase new refrigerator and stove and find used base cabinets we can refinish at the Loading Dock or the Restore that will work with the upper cabinets we were able to save and we have some paint but need more so we are reaching out for more funding but we are giving back with great perks in return for your help. Our perks are pretty cool, like our T-shirts with our original logo, our wildflower and Milkweed seeds which will present the opportunity for you to enjoy beautiful flowers while giving a second time, this time to nature by helping to save the Monarch Butterfly and other pollinators, and then there is our Children's books that were written by Baltimore legend Lucretia (Lu) Fisher who helped save both Fells Point and Federal Hill from the wrecking ball by helping to stop a planned Highway Project back in the 70's and there are beautiful Art Prints and other great perks to choose from. These wonderful perks will be our way of giving back to you for your generosity. Please help us in our efforts and our quest to find solutions to deforestation while helping subsistence farming communities improve their lives all while helping to save our Planet's Remaining Rainforest and the creatures that call the rainforest home.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>At Granja Tia Nora we apply and experiment with different
types of organic farming, <b style=""color: #639e2e;"">permaculture</b> and <b style=""color: #639e2e;"">biointensive agriculture</b>. These are farming methods that enrich the earth, rather than industrial
agricultural methods which impoverish it. Since 2013 all our vegetable

The health of our earth and our children is essential
to us. We cultivate our vegetable garden without any
pesticides, or chemical fertilizer and only from organic seeds. Our farm is based on harmony between the animal life and the vegetable
life. The earth feeds us and our animals and in return, our animals produce the
compost which feeds the earth.
At Granja Tia Nora we apply and experiment with different
types of organic farming, permaculture and biointensive agriculture. These are farming methods that enrich the earth, rather than industrial
agricultural methods which impoverish it. Since 2013 all our vegetable
production is verified and certified organic by the label
of OIA (Organisation Internationale Agropecuaria). 
We want to ensure that our earth continues to provide
for future generations, so we want to teach people, especially children, how to
look after it and treat it well. We are working to improve the facilities we
have so more people are able to visit us. This is where we need your help.
We need to raise $3800 so we can welcome more visitors to Tia Nora.
We need your help to enable us to finish bathrooms for
our visitors, particularly those for disabled visitors. These facilities will
mean we are able to welcome more groups to the farm, to learn and enjoy nature.We have already built a quarter of the building, but
we need your support to finish! $3800 will help us buy materials and some tools
to replace those that were unfortunately stolen from us. We have set aside $500
cash to contribute ourselves and have many willing volunteers who will be able
to assist our builder. Please help us complete this important project! 
We are very grateful for your support and if you
donate we will welcome you to visit Granja Tia Nora any time. However we know
that if you live far away this might not be possible so we have other gifts to
thank you, depending on your contribution you can select from the following:
- 
POSTCARD FROM THE FARM: to send
a piece of green air to your friends, choose our country pictures, freshly
taken from the garden just for you!- TEXTILE BAGS: Fashionable

Nora.

- CANASTA DE LA HUERTA: for the people of San Juan we offer you a basket of vegetables from our garden, all organic of course! The basket is an artisanal one made by a local artisan. We'll deliver it to your door.- KITS OF SEEDS: from the most common
to the rarest, with these seeds you can cultivate a piece of Granja Tia Nora at
home. You can choose the small kit of a selection of 5 types de seeds or the big one with 10 types of seeds. The kits included flowers and vegetables seeds.
- STAY IN OUR ECOLODGE: take

<h3>Sanitation in Kigali</h3>
<p>Rwanda does not have a sewer system.</p>
<p><strong>93% of Kigali’s human waste is released into the environment untreated.</strong></p>
<p>Pit Vidura provides a solution to this.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522865455/rbd7wynjpu2gomatafjc.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>At Pit Vidura we’ve replaced inhumane and unhygienic methods of emptying waste from non-sewered toilets with our double vacuum pumping system, the “DoVac,” that reduces servicing time to minutes, eliminates odors, and minimizes contact between hazardous waste and people. Standard vacuum trucks in Kigali can empty pits from households that are up to 30 meters from a road. This means most low-income households located in dense areas far from the road are out of reach for basic waste management services. </p>
<p><strong>We’ve developed a system that can empty waste from a over 200 meters away from our truck! </strong>This allows us to offer our safe waste removal services to households in even the poorest, densest, and most inaccessible areas. Our employees are equipped head-to-toe with personal protective gear and households love our professional, quick, and affordable service.</p>

<p><u>Why not build sewers?</u></p>
<p>Sewers are not always the best urban solution. They are inappropriate where water is very scarce – and where it isn’t feasible to extend them to lower-income settlements or those on city outskirts.

<p>A mix of technical solutions including both onsite and sewerage solutions is needed to ensure citywide inclusive sanitation—a sanitation system in which everybody benefits from sanitation infrastructure. Pit Vidura focuses on developing the components of an inclusive sanitation plan that benefit the poorest of the poor in the hardest to reach urban locations.</p>

<p>My name is Daniel Bernazzani. I have a Ph.D. in Environmental Studies from Antioch University. I have seen first hand the damage floods cause. Unfortunately, once the floodwaters recede and TV cameras are gone, secondary damage from mold and other microorganisms becomes a potetial health health concern for homeoweners and cleanup workers alike. Post-flood dangers can be dramatically reduced with simple training. Shockingly, the US has no central training organization for flood victims or volunteers. The educational resources currently available are fragmented and fraught with outdated procedures that could endanger the very individuals the information seeks to protect.</p>
<p><strong>To remedy this situation, Flood Safe Habitats will provide up-to-date, centralized, accessible online training developed by leading experts in the field. </strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We need funding to produce our first training video that provides guidance to workers. We need this because in the absence of insurance coverage or other funds necessary to secure the services of a professional water damage mitigation contractor, the homeowner is faced with the formidable task of conducting the remediation, typically with the assistance of friends, relatives, or volunteers. In these situations it is imperative that the homeowner and volunteers be sufficiently prepared to conduct such an effort with professional guidance and with the health and safety of all involved uppermost in mind. It is crucial to point out some areas of the home that appear to have only minor mold growth or appear to be or non-water damaged, may actually harbor considerable contamination. Moreover, other hazards may be present. Our training can help prevent further disaster.</p>
<p>Our program is an extremely cost-effective way to thwart preventable diseases and potential hazards. Along with the reduction in human suffering, this program should reduce the burden on healthcare, eliminate duplication of efforts by state and local organizations, and provide a resource that can be readily updated as new remediation techniques are developed.</p>

<h2><strong>*Who We Are</strong></h2>
<h3>Mother Earth Buildings</h3>
<p>Is an organization that shares  skills and knowledge for people to create their own sustainable way of life.</p>
<p>We are the founders and creators of this organization. It feels like for most of our life, we both have had the desire to make a difference in peoples lives. Since our meeting with each other while building a straw bale cabin in New York, we have set upon this amazing journey together.  Both of us come from a background in alternative building and have been living our lives in the most effective and efficient way we can. We have taught people about building with natural materials and have helped with the site design and layouts for many eco villages in Europe, as well as, Friland, where we currently live in Denmark. Our family also includes Bella, our 2 year old daughter who is the most beautiful, friendly and loving little person you could ever meet. We want to do everything we can to make a positive impact, for people, families, and all living creatures on earth.</p>
<p>My name is Peter Jensen. I come from Denmark. For 15 years I have been in love with straw bale homes. I've found how easy it is to live in harmony with nature and found such joy in building. I've been involved in building a lot of straw and wooden houses throughout the world and have designed many of them. I have given a number of presentations on sustainable housing and ecological ways of living with nature. I am a product developer and am always trying to find better ways to build houses. I am a project leader for building and designing schools and homes for the people of Nepal. I have seen great success with the work I have done in Nepal and would like to continue that throughout the world.  I have traveled around the world and have seen many poor people use so much energy to just survive, which has touched me deeply. We have created solutions to help give these people a better life.  My heart has fallen in love with spreading sustainable knowledge around the world.</p>
<p>My name is Ashley Ritzel. I am from Upstate New York in the U.S. I have been involved with natural building for a number of years and have experience with permaculture in a number of different climates as well. I love learning new ways of building to understand what works best in order  to create self-sufficiency around the world. I find it extremely rewarding to share information with people that enables them to be independent. Not only is it sustainable to build with natural materials, it can be healing on many levels as well. By working together in creating something, people learn the importance of teamwork and develop healthy relationships with each other, themselves and the planet. I enjoy teaching and facilitating these workshops for people to come together and experience this deep connection.</p>
<h2>*Our Lifes Passion</h2>
<p>MEB wants to make e-books that explain simple step by step methods in how local and natural materials can be used to create an inexpensive, safe and beautiful home. We want to fill our website, with the knowledge and information on how to become self-sufficient in food, electricity, water and heating of houses made from natural and renewable materials.</p>
<p>We feel extremely passionate about our goal in making a difference for people around the world.  We have traveled and seen with our own eyes, the unnecessary suffering of many poor people around the world. We have the personal experience with living in sustainable ways, as well as, building and design experience. We realize how simple and important it is to live in harmony with mother earth.  So, we want to do our part in sharing this life changing information to make a difference for all people around the world.</p>
<h2>*How YOU can help</h2>
<h3>“Give a man a fish, feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, feed him for his life.” Chinese proverb</h3>
<p>With your support, Mother Earth Buildings can reach the lives of millions of people around the world.  We can help teach people how to become self-reliant and independent through living sustainably. We don’t just want to give people a home or food for them to be safe and healthy. We want to give people the knowledge for them to be able to support themselves and to be independent from outside resources.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>*What We Need</h2>
<h3>We are looking to raise $20,000.00.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In many places throughout the world, many people live on less than a dollar a day. With every dollar we receive, an enormous amount is being accomplished.</p>
<p>We are seeking $20,000.00.</p>
<p>With this amount of money we are able to accomplish the following.</p>
<p>We will have the funding to go ahead and create 42 simple step by step E-books. They will include solutions for building various sustainable housing and hundreds of ways for one to become self- sufficient in food, power and water. All of these ideas can be utilized by wealthy and poor populations in any climate throughout the world.</p>
<p>We will have the funding to attend a workshop at CAL-EARTH in Hesperia, California to learn how to build using sandbags.</p>
<p>We will have the money to purchase the computer and equipment that allows us to update and manage our website.</p>
<p>Even if we do not reach our goal of $20,000.00 we will still be able to use the funds received. We can use the money towards the expense of writing and creating a variety of E-books on sustainability and to the cost of managing and updating our website for people to access information, videos and guides for free.</p>

<h2>*Our Success</h2>
<p>We have had success with projects completed around the globe. We have built schools and houses for needy children in Nepal. These buildings were constructed using local and natural materials and built using man power and hand tools. If you don’t realize how phenomenal this is, try and think about cutting a 20 ft. long tree into a four sided beam using only a hand saw.  This project helped create the necessary and vital schools for impoverished students in the frigid climate of the Himalayan Mountains.  We have also helped start numerous ecovillages in Europe that are very successful.</p>
<p>With your help we have a better chance to reach people around the world that are in serious need of basic things to survive. We don’t want to go and put a band aid on the problem, we are dedicated to finding the best answers and giving people these solutions.</p>

The name in itself is quite descriptive and to simplify it even more: Bamboo means wood, Forest means biodiversity and Fruits means food.</p><p>Tenerife is a volcanic island in the North Atlantic Ocean and belongs to the group of islands called Canary islands, situated close to African continent and are part of Macaronesia. It is a home to one of the largest volcano and one of the richest biodiversity in the world, but also, one of the most fragile ecosystems, that are highly sensitive to climate change, threatened by the pollution and loss of natural habitat, due to the conventional agriculture, unsustainable tourism and urbanization. Here in the island, we developed an even greater passion for nature and have spent most of the time, in recent years, learning about the climate, ecosystems, plants and other living creatures, while gaining more experience in agriculture and Eco-tourism.</p><p>This is how the idea to establish the nature reserve with Eco-retreat and the food forest was born. Finally, we have a suitable plots of land to start this project and now are few months here, living and working, but we need more funds to continue the work. Some of the funds needed are crucial and urgent, for example water compartments and ponds, to give us an important security of water supply for irrigation. </p><p>Our regenerative agriculture concept consists of a mix of few agricultural systems and our own interpretations. The aim is to rejuvenate the degraded agricultural land, increase natural productivity and biodiversity, combat soil contamination and desertification, adapt agriculture to natural conditions and cycles.</p><p>Agroforestry system is a combination of forestry and agriculture, where trees and shrubs grow alongside smaller edible plants or pasture. This type of agriculture gaining increasing recognition around the world, as a way of reducing land desertification, soil and water contamination and the carbon emissions, produced by the conventional agriculture. </p><p>Food forest or edible forest is another term of gardening in harmony with nature, following the nature's patterns and letting the natural formation of ecosystem to take place, it is a low-intervention and low-maintenance type of gardening. The term food forest is now widely adopted by the permaculture enthusiasts and community gardeners alike, and is associated with polyculture gardening.</p><p>Bamboo is a perfect woody crop for both agroforestry and permaculture systems with the unbeatable benefits of growth rate, self-regeneration and resilience. Bamboo plays an important role of providing alternative, green material for construction, furniture and numerous everyday items, that are currently made of unsustainable materials, including highly polluting plastic and aluminium.  Besides, bamboo absorbs high levels of CO2 and produce more oxygen than trees. There are two main types of bamboo, clumping (non-invasive) and running (invasive). We plant only non-invasive clumping bamboos. </p><p>An important part of this project is the integration of agriculture with consumers. The social networks and the on site visits enable the consumer to familiarize with the process of food production, consequently develop a better understanding of nature and agriculture. The one to one relations with the grower and the buyer, reduces food waste and carbon footprint, optimizes the quality and freshness, creates a greater value for consumer and fairer profit for producer.</p><p>The idea to create a small eco-retreat is to provide an ecological and affordable accommodation surrounded by nature and powered by renewable energy. Visitors have the benefit of fresh fruits, veg and herbs grown here, an opportunity to experience the rural life of northwestern side of Tenerife and learn about agriculture and natural surroundings.</p><p><strong>What are the funds for:</strong></p><ol>
<li>
<u>Water compartments and ponds for irrigation</u>. The pond also has a role of attracting wildlife. For irrigation purposes, it is needed for connecting to the antique canal system and to store water, this is known as ""own water"". The company that provides water for us at the moment has a low quality water, frequent pressure problems and cuts during the summer, when it is needed the most. We prefer not to use irrigation, but for young plants and trees it is crucial and it is necessary for the veg and fruit gardens, during the drought. </li>
<li>
<u>Bamboos, fruit trees and other edible plants</u>. We have already started planting bamboos, fruit trees, bushes and climbing plants, also herbs and veggies. There are a wide selection of the plants that can be established in the land, because of the mild climate conditions and the different micro climates here, due to the altitude variations and sun and wind distribution.

The name in itself is quite descriptive and to simplify it even more: Bamboo means wood, Forest means biodiversity and Fruits means food.Tenerife is a volcanic island in the North Atlantic Ocean and belongs to the group of islands called Canary islands, situated close to African continent and are part of Macaronesia. It is a home to one of the largest volcano and one of the richest biodiversity in the world, but also, one of the most fragile ecosystems, that are highly sensitive to climate change, threatened by the pollution and loss of natural habitat, due to the conventional agriculture, unsustainable tourism and urbanization. Here in the island, we developed an even greater passion for nature and have spent most of the time, in recent years, learning about the climate, ecosystems, plants and other living creatures, while gaining more experience in agriculture and Eco-tourism.This is how the idea to establish the nature reserve with Eco-retreat and the food forest was born. Finally, we have a suitable plots of land to start this project and now are few months here, living and working, but we need more funds to continue the work. Some of the funds needed are crucial and urgent, for example water compartments and ponds, to give us an important security of water supply for irrigation. Our regenerative agriculture concept consists of a mix of few agricultural systems and our own interpretations. The aim is to rejuvenate the degraded agricultural land, increase natural productivity and biodiversity, combat soil contamination and desertification, adapt agriculture to natural conditions and cycles.Agroforestry system is a combination of forestry and agriculture, where trees and shrubs grow alongside smaller edible plants or pasture. This type of agriculture gaining increasing recognition around the world, as a way of reducing land desertification, soil and water contamination and the carbon emissions, produced by the conventional agriculture. Food forest or edible forest is another term of gardening in harmony with nature, following the nature's patterns and letting the natural formation of ecosystem to take place, it is a low-intervention and low-maintenance type of gardening. The term food forest is now widely adopted by the permaculture enthusiasts and community gardeners alike, and is associated with polyculture gardening.Bamboo is a perfect woody crop for both agroforestry and permaculture systems with the unbeatable benefits of growth rate, self-regeneration and resilience. Bamboo plays an important role of providing alternative, green material for construction, furniture and numerous everyday items, that are currently made of unsustainable materials, including highly polluting plastic and aluminium.  Besides, bamboo absorbs high levels of CO2 and produce more oxygen than trees. There are two main types of bamboo, clumping (non-invasive) and running (invasive). We plant only non-invasive clumping bamboos. An important part of this project is the integration of agriculture with consumers. The social networks and the on site visits enable the consumer to familiarize with the process of food production, consequently develop a better understanding of nature and agriculture. The one to one relations with the grower and the buyer, reduces food waste and carbon footprint, optimizes the quality and freshness, creates a greater value for consumer and fairer profit for producer.The idea to create a small eco-retreat is to provide an ecological and affordable accommodation surrounded by nature and powered by renewable energy. Visitors have the benefit of fresh fruits, veg and herbs grown here, an opportunity to experience the rural life of northwestern side of Tenerife and learn about agriculture and natural surroundings.What are the funds for:

Water compartments and ponds for irrigation. The pond also has a role of attracting wildlife. For irrigation purposes, it is needed for connecting to the antique canal system and to store water, this is known as ""own water"". The company that provides water for us at the moment has a low quality water, frequent pressure problems and cuts during the summer, when it is needed the most. We prefer not to use irrigation, but for young plants and trees it is crucial and it is necessary for the veg and fruit gardens, during the drought. 

Bamboos, fruit trees and other edible plants. We have already started planting bamboos, fruit trees, bushes and climbing plants, also herbs and veggies. There are a wide selection of the plants that can be established in the land, because of the mild climate conditions and the different micro climates here, due to the altitude variations and sun and wind distribution. The size of the plot for planting is 4000 square meters and is spread through the 167 - 200  meters in altitude.

Nature resort and retreat. The largest part of the property is the mountain, an area of 10000 square meters (1  hectare). Most of it is already protected, as it is located Teno Rural Park boundaries. The plan is to clean and fix the paths, replant some local flora and create a view point.  Although the Eco-retreat accommodation will be constructed in the lower and gated area. The geodesic dome structure cabin, will have all the basic amenities and due to the shape and open design, spacious and airy. The mixture off glass and wood, makes it light, fresh and warm. The dome is not only the strongest structure known, it is also energy efficient.

Renewable energy. We have 3500 W solar system, which we need to double to make it more efficient.

New entrance. There are two entrances at the moment, but both of them with the difficult access for vehicles.  It is necessary to create new entrance for the easy access and to avoid accidents and damages to vehicles.

Gates and fences. Due to the age and the material, some need to be fixed or replaced.

<p>We are students at the University of Arizona who are traveling to South Africa this summer with International Student Volunteers. Here's a little info to tell you who we are.</p>
<p>Ashlynn Harris is a 4th year student studying animal science. She is traveling with ISV for the first time.</p>
<p>Justin Marshall is a 4th year student in biomedical engineering and has previously volunteered with ISV in New Zealand doing conservation work. He was involved in helping to plant over 4,000 native trees and plants to help regrow lost forest in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Amber Sumpter is a 4th year student dual majoring in journalism and gender and women's studies. She has previsouly worked with ISV in the Domincan Republic</p>
<p>Most of us had our passion for traveling and volunteering sparked with our first ventures with ISV and are greatly looking forward to working with them again.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The project will cost $3,795 for each of us, which will cover lodging, program fees, a mojority of food costs, and touring costs. In addition we will have to cover airfaire and any other fees that come up, so overall it is roughley $5,000 a piece. This campaign is to get some funds to get everyone a little help.</p>
<p>Whatever is raised during this campaign will be distributed evenly to the students involved.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The South Africa trip offers both community development and conservation work as a focus for the volunteers, chosen at the preference of the volunteer upon signing up.</p>
<p>Community development includes building schools and playgrounds, community health and education programs, sustainable food production, and recreational activities for children.</p>
<p>Conservation work includes working at wildlife preserves, preservation of habitats, and wildlife park management.</p>

<p>Water quality is a global concern. Almost 1 billion people lack access to safe drinking water and 2 million die every year from unsafe water. Even in the United States, it is estimated that as many as 2,000,000 households have drinking water with dangerously high levels of nitrate, a serious threat to infants (methemoglobinemia, more commonly known as ""blue baby syndrome"", inhibits oxygen transport by red blood cells).</p>
<p>Due to adverse environmental impacts from industry, inadequate and aging municipal infrastructure, and general shortcomings of regulatory systems, there is an express need for everyday citizen's to take more responsibility in the monitoring the environmental health of their world. Beyond our own health and safety, this need is especially vital if we want to ensure a sustainable future for our children. However, the scientific equipment and technical training required to accomplish this task is beyond the reach of most citizens, even in wealthy nations like the United States.

<h2>Stage of the Project and What Your Contribution Means</h2>
<p>This project builds on technologies developed through research that we have dedicated our professional and personal lives towards. We have already developed a prototype version of our low-cost handheld sensor for nitrate measurement. The performance of this proof-of-concept device is impressive; we're detecting nitrate down to 25 parts-per-billion at a fraction of the cost of typical methods. We have field validated data sharing using Twitter. While we're very happy with our proof-of-concept, but we're nowhere near full potential.</p>
<p>We anticipate the project will take up to two years to reach full scale for all planned sensing targets. We plan to start deploying our sensor for nitrate measurement within the next 6 months, working with citizen scientist groups (research institutes, NGOs) in Illinois. If this early testing proves successful, we'll scale up as needed. Given our sensor's construction process, we are confident that contract manufacturing will be able to easily produce our hardware at low cost and high quality. We're also developing partnerships with individuals, non-profits, and for-profit companies that share our vision.</p>
<p>Currently, using on-campus rapid prototyping facilities, we can make our sensor hardware for under $200 per unit. Once scaled beyond 500 units, we estimate that price will drop substantially under $100. In addition to expanding sensing capabilities (our next focus is on heavy metals), money raised will go towards improving the device for mass manufacture and producing an initial batch to be validated by citizen scientists affiliated the University of Illinois.</p></div>","Social Need
Water quality is a global concern. Almost 1 billion people lack access to safe drinking water and 2 million die every year from unsafe water. Even in the United States, it is estimated that as many as 2,000,000 households have drinking water with dangerously high levels of nitrate, a serious threat to infants (methemoglobinemia, more commonly known as ""blue baby syndrome"", inhibits oxygen transport by red blood cells).
Due to adverse environmental impacts from industry, inadequate and aging municipal infrastructure, and general shortcomings of regulatory systems, there is an express need for everyday citizen's to take more responsibility in the monitoring the environmental health of their world. Beyond our own health and safety, this need is especially vital if we want to ensure a sustainable future for our children. However, the scientific equipment and technical training required to accomplish this task is beyond the reach of most citizens, even in wealthy nations like the United States. In response to this great social need, we're developing a low-cost, high-accuracy, and extremely versatile sensor technology that makes use of nanotechnology and integrates with mobile devices: MoboSens.
MoboSens will give anyone with a smartphone the ability to measure the concentration of common pollutants - like nitrate, arsenic, chromium, lead - in water (municipal supply, private wells) and even soil (if properly prepared).

<p>We are 2 Environmental science majors who are getting involved in a summer conversation project in South America this summer. We are both “hippies” at heart and saw this as a great way to spend our summer! Not only do we get to go and visit one of the most beautiful and bio diverse parts of the world, we also get to make a difference in a field we believe so passionately in. Not only do we get to do important conservation work we also get the chance to learn another language, Spanish! We are hoping that we can get you excited about our project and then follow our progress as we lead up to leaving and then as we explore Costa Rica!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This coming summer the 2 of us will be undertaking the ISV Student  Volunteer project in Costa Rica, South America.  The <strong>International Student Vollunteers</strong> is a worldwide organisation that works to connect students from university’s around the world with volunteer projects focusing on community development and conversation initiatives.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have both chosen to undertake the Conservation project which involves at least 80 hours of volunteering work in Costa Rica over a fortnight! We know this experience will broaden our awareness of environmental issues outside our own backyard and give as hands on, practical experience we can use in the future.</p>
<p>Our team will be working in areas such as,</p>
<ul>
<li>Endangered species protection such as beach patrols and light construction for sea turtle hatchlings.</li>
<li>Observing and recording animal numbers and behaviours.</li>
<li>Restoring and researching animal habitats.</li>

<h2>Welcome to Greenshire Eco Farms! We are a fun, functional, educational, and inspirational cooperatively owned farm.</h2>
<h3>We grow community, partnership, compassion, self-awareness, connections to nature, ourselves and each other...</h3>
<p><img alt=""Travis, our garden manager, gives a tour of the permaculture gardens."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://greenshireecofarms.com/wp-content/gallery/kawartha-farmfest-2011/dscf1090.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;""/></p>
<p><strong>We</strong> also grow vegetables, fruit, nuts, and mushrooms using Permaculture methods and provide healthy, fresh, beyond-organic produce to our local community in the Kawartha Lakes region of Ontario, Canada. We offer tours, presentations, workshops, volunteer and internship opportunities to the public in our award-winning, unique Permaculture gardens. (Haven't heard of Permaculture? ... Please read on to learn more!)</p>
<p><strong>Greenshire</strong> is also a sanctuary for neglected, abused and unwanted animals including horses, pigs, dogs, cats, chickens, ducks and turtles. Our critters love to mingle with our visitors and they help to foster a strong connection to the natural world. Greenshire is also the proud home to the Healing Horse Centre - a place where horses <em>and</em> humans heal!</p>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://greenshireecofarms.com/wp-content/gallery/horses/cindysnugamelieherald.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin: 10px;""/>Our</strong> Healing Horse Centre offers rescue and rehabilitation services for unwanted and special-needs horses. The horses then partner with us to offer Facilitated Equine Experiential Learning or FEEL to humans in our community.  The non-riding FEEL workshops offer life-changing lessons and personal insights for teens to seniors, at-risk youth, survivors of abuse, and anyone else looking to make positive changes in their lives. The rescue horses are powerful teachers who also benefit immensely from this work as it gives them a renewed purpose in life.</p>
<p><strong>We</strong> founded Greenshire Eco Farms in 2009 with a group of 12 people who all had the same vision... to create a working farm to share with the members of our community. We believe strongly that a connection to the natural world and our food source is a vital and often missing part of a healthy, loving, fulfilled life. We are here for the greater community to come and make that connection, learn, grow and share!</p>
<p><strong>In</strong> the three and a half years we have been together, from not knowing much about farming and living in close-community we have learned many lessons and the most important lesson we have coming forward is one of PARTNERSHIP! T<span class=""userContent""><span class=""userContent"">o continue to grow and evolve in this exciting new era we need to support each other. We have put our hearts and souls (and every last penny) into this venture and it's time that we open up our hearts and reach out further to the community. <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://greenshireecofarms.com/wp-content/gallery/horses/midnovember-037.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 10px;""/><br/></span></span></p>
<p><span class=""userContent""><span class=""userContent""><strong>We</strong> need your help to secure a mortgage so that we may continue with our important mission.  Greenshire (and the Healing Horse Centre) is in the immediate danger of foreclosure and we need to raise a minimum of $50,000 to ensure our survival. <br/></span></span></p>

<h2><strong>More about us...</strong></h2>
<h3>Farming:</h3>
<h3>Our farm is a 100-acre property made up of about 70 acres of fields, 25 acres of young forest, and 5 acres of wetland.</h3>
<p><strong>Greenshire</strong> is first and foremost a Permaculture farm.</p>
<p><em><strong>""Permaculture</strong> is the conscious design and maintenance of agriculturally productive systems which have the diversity, stability, and resilience of natural ecosystems. It is the harmonious integration of the landscape with people providing their food, energy, shelter and other material and non-material needs in a sustainable way.""</em></p>
<dl><dd><em>Graham Bell, The Permaculture Way</em></dd></dl>
<p><strong>Using</strong> Permaculture philosophy and methods, we have created 3 acres of food-producing gardens with a mix of vegetables, herbs, trees and shrubs, planted 3 acres of nut trees, and 1500 asparagus plants.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://greenshireecofarms.com/wp-content/gallery/farmfest-2012/043_43.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin: 10px; float: left;""/>Modern</strong> methods of farming have largely scraped natural ecosystems off the map to grow monocultures (large areas with only one type of plant) using huge amounts of chemicals which further degrade the environment. Modern farming practices have resulted in huge losses of topsoil, and biodiversity. We are part of a movement seeking to change these practices so that our society does not crumble under food shortages as most cultures of the past have done.</p>
<p><strong>Using</strong> nature as a model and inspiration, we at Greenshire grow food using no-tillage cultivation, organic pest/disease control, and mixed crop planting. The goal is to have as little negative impact on the land as possible while still obtaining a substantial yield.</p>
<h3>Animal Sanctuary:</h3>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://greenshireecofarms.com/wp-content/gallery/kawartha-farmfest-2011/dscf1133.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 10px;""/>At</strong> Greenshire, we love animals and treat them as we would like to be treated. We take in unwanted animals of many different species and encourage the public to come and connect with these beautiful creatures, fostering compassion and empathy.</p>
<p><strong>We</strong> are also passionate about holistic animal-keeping and we strive to provide the most biologically appropriate and naturalized environment for all of our animals.We offer classes and workshops on these topics as we feel education is the key to eliminating animal homelessness, neglect, and abuse.</p>
<p><strong>We</strong> have plans to expand the sanctuary to take in a wider variety of species which we hope will include a Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre (one of our farm members has a background in Wildlife Rehab).</p>
<h3>Healing Horse Centre:</h3>
<p><strong>The</strong> Healing Horse Centre is our soon-to-be registered non-profit arm of Greenshire.</p>
<p><strong>We</strong> take in unwanted, special-needs equines (horses and donkeys) and spend tremendous amounts of time, energy, and money healing them.</p>
<p><strong> Our</strong> equines come from many different backgrounds; some have emotional scars, some physical. The same goes for our clients in the Facilitated Equine Experiential Learning or FEEL sessions and workshops. The humans who participate in these workshops come from all backgrounds and all stages of life. No matter what our story is, we all tend to have baggage that we carry from living in our broken society.  Horses are powerful, non-judgemental creatures who live in the moment and are always congruent in their emotions. They tend to very easily let go of past wrongs and learn to trust and thrive given the right conditions.  As humans we can learn alot from their way of life and because the lessons are experienced, instead of being read from a book, they are immensely life-changing!</p>
<p><strong>Here's</strong> what one of our participants had to say:</p>
<p><em><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>“Enlightening</strong>, powerful and transformative are the words I would use to describe my experience with the horses.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>It</strong> was like the horses could see past all the walls and boundaries that a person puts up to cope with all those difficult life moments. It was like the horses could see through the emotional baggage and the personal obstacles right into your core where they reached out and touched you with their gentleness.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>Before</strong> I went through the experience myself I was skeptical and unsure but the workshop opened me to a new way of learning about myself. I did not expect to be so moved and to gain so much insight into myself.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>I</strong> left the workshop, after the discussions and the exercises with the horses, with a peaceful feeling that somehow I was more centred and grounded.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>Kaileen</strong> and Cindy were supportive and skilful facilitators who guided me through the process. They made it a safe place to open up on an emotional level so that I could truly experience the energy and connection with the horses.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>I</strong> would personally recommend you to try this wonderful experience – there is nothing like it anywhere!!!!”</span></em></p>
<p><strong>Julie E., Toronto, Ontario</strong><br/><strong> May 2011</strong></p>
<p><strong>You</strong> can read more of our touching testimonials here:</p>
<p><a href=""http://greenshireecofarms.com/healing-horse-centre/feel-testimonials/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://greenshireecofarms.com/healing-horse-centre/feel-testimonials/</a></p>
<h3>Community:</h3>
<p><strong>The</strong> other side of Permaculture is the fostering of culture and community. Greenshire is a multi-family intentional community with 13 members, 6 of whom live on the farm. We are always open to considering new members. Greenshire operates as a co-op, where all major decisions are voted on democratically.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://greenshireecofarms.com/wp-content/gallery/farmfest-2012/img_0244.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin: 10px;""/>At</strong> Greenshire we are very passionate about expanding public awareness. We actively engage with the local community through presentations at public events, and our farm tours which are open to the general public, schools, and special interest groups. The tours showcase the Healing Horse Centre and our demonstration gardens that give examples of what people can do in their own backyards.</p>
<p><strong>We</strong> have many people come to the farm from as close as down the road, to as far as Europe and the Middle East,  to volunteer and gain new skills and experiences. Some stay for a few days to a week, while others stay for the better part of a year. In the future we plan to offer a multitude of interesting and educational courses and events such as an introduction to permaculture, yoga, meditation, wildlife observation, birding, music, visual arts, dance, shamanism, and astronomy, among others.</p>
<p><strong>We</strong> also aspire to build a large Earthship house which will be our central dwelling with multiple units for current and future residents, as well as various styles of  environmentally sound cottages which would be available to non-resident co-op members, the general public, and volunteers.</p>

<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<div>
<p><strong>We'll</strong> break it down for you folks in more detail:</p>
<p><strong>We</strong> have had the farm for 3.5 years through a short-term mortgage held by the previous owner of the property. The mortgage holders (previous owners) are an extremely generous couple who acquired the property through auction. They had initially made the purchase as a potential future retirement property for themselves and in the mean-time they would rent it out.</p>
<p><strong>We</strong> came across the property after an extensive search and it was love at first-sight. The generous couple has since decided it was too much land for their needs and agreed to sell it to us and hold the mortgage.</p>
<p><strong>Since</strong> living here we have put enormous amounts of money into establishing the farm (horse shelter, tack room, fencing, gardens, seeds, plants, trees, and equipment, etc.). We have been increasing our income each year, but as you may know it takes a while to get a start-up business to become sustainable and then profitable. </p>
<p><strong>The</strong> short-term mortgage held by the previous owner of the farm is now up and we have been applying for a long-term mortgage through banks and private lenders.</p>
<p><strong>Our</strong> farm has been appraised for $347,000 and we are certain that we can secure a farm mortgage for around 70% of this value (banks and lenders typically only give this percentage for farm mortgages) which would be approx $240,000, we owe our current mortgage holder $305,000 and so the difference to pay off our current mortgage holder is somewhere in around $50,000. </p>

Welcome to Greenshire Eco Farms! We are a fun, functional, educational, and inspirational cooperatively owned farm.
We grow community, partnership, compassion, self-awareness, connections to nature, ourselves and each other...

We also grow vegetables, fruit, nuts, and mushrooms using Permaculture methods and provide healthy, fresh, beyond-organic produce to our local community in the Kawartha Lakes region of Ontario, Canada. We offer tours, presentations, workshops, volunteer and internship opportunities to the public in our award-winning, unique Permaculture gardens. (Haven't heard of Permaculture? ... Please read on to learn more!)
Greenshire is also a sanctuary for neglected, abused and unwanted animals including horses, pigs, dogs, cats, chickens, ducks and turtles. Our critters love to mingle with our visitors and they help to foster a strong connection to the natural world. Greenshire is also the proud home to the Healing Horse Centre - a place where horses and humans heal!
Our Healing Horse Centre offers rescue and rehabilitation services for unwanted and special-needs horses. The horses then partner with us to offer Facilitated Equine Experiential Learning or FEEL to humans in our community.  The non-riding FEEL workshops offer life-changing lessons and personal insights for teens to seniors, at-risk youth, survivors of abuse, and anyone else looking to make positive changes in their lives. The rescue horses are powerful teachers who also benefit immensely from this work as it gives them a renewed purpose in life.
We founded Greenshire Eco Farms in 2009 with a group of 12 people who all had the same vision... to create a working farm to share with the members of our community. We believe strongly that a connection to the natural world and our food source is a vital and often missing part of a healthy, loving, fulfilled life. We are here for the greater community to come and make that connection, learn, grow and share!
In the three and a half years we have been together, from not knowing much about farming and living in close-community we have learned many lessons and the most important lesson we have coming forward is one of PARTNERSHIP! To continue to grow and evolve in this exciting new era we need to support each other. We have put our hearts and souls (and every last penny) into this venture and it's time that we open up our hearts and reach out further to the community. 
We need your help to secure a mortgage so that we may continue with our important mission.  Greenshire (and the Healing Horse Centre) is in the immediate danger of foreclosure and we need to raise a minimum of $50,000 to ensure our survival. 
PLEASE CONSIDER MAKING A CONTRIBUTION - no amount is too small!

More about us...
Farming:
Our farm is a 100-acre property made up of about 70 acres of fields, 25 acres of young forest, and 5 acres of wetland.
Greenshire is first and foremost a Permaculture farm.
""Permaculture is the conscious design and maintenance of agriculturally productive systems which have the diversity, stability, and resilience of natural ecosystems. It is the harmonious integration of the landscape with people providing their food, energy, shelter and other material and non-material needs in a sustainable way.""
Graham Bell, The Permaculture Way
Using Permaculture philosophy and methods, we have created 3 acres of food-producing gardens with a mix of vegetables, herbs, trees and shrubs, planted 3 acres of nut trees, and 1500 asparagus plants.
Modern methods of farming have largely scraped natural ecosystems off the map to grow monocultures (large areas with only one type of plant) using huge amounts of chemicals which further degrade the environment. Modern farming practices have resulted in huge losses of topsoil, and biodiversity. We are part of a movement seeking to change these practices so that our society does not crumble under food shortages as most cultures of the past have done.
Using nature as a model and inspiration, we at Greenshire grow food using no-tillage cultivation, organic pest/disease control, and mixed crop planting. The goal is to have as little negative impact on the land as possible while still obtaining a substantial yield.
Animal Sanctuary:
At Greenshire, we love animals and treat them as we would like to be treated. We take in unwanted animals of many different species and encourage the public to come and connect with these beautiful creatures, fostering compassion and empathy.
We are also passionate about holistic animal-keeping and we strive to provide the most biologically appropriate and naturalized environment for all of our animals.We offer classes and workshops on these topics as we feel education is the key to eliminating animal homelessness, neglect, and abuse.
We have plans to expand the sanctuary to take in a wider variety of species which we hope will include a Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre (one of our farm members has a background in Wildlife Rehab).
Healing Horse Centre:
The Healing Horse Centre is our soon-to-be registered non-profit arm of Greenshire.
We take in unwanted, special-needs equines (horses and donkeys) and spend tremendous amounts of time, energy, and money healing them.
 Our equines come from many different backgrounds; some have emotional scars, some physical. The same goes for our clients in the Facilitated Equine Experiential Learning or FEEL sessions and workshops. The humans who participate in these workshops come from all backgrounds and all stages of life. No matter what our story is, we all tend to have baggage that we carry from living in our broken society.  Horses are powerful, non-judgemental creatures who live in the moment and are always congruent in their emotions. They tend to very easily let go of past wrongs and learn to trust and thrive given the right conditions.  As humans we can learn alot from their way of life and because the lessons are experienced, instead of being read from a book, they are immensely life-changing!
Here's what one of our participants had to say:
“Enlightening, powerful and transformative are the words I would use to describe my experience with the horses.
It was like the horses could see past all the walls and boundaries that a person puts up to cope with all those difficult life moments. It was like the horses could see through the emotional baggage and the personal obstacles right into your core where they reached out and touched you with their gentleness.
Before I went through the experience myself I was skeptical and unsure but the workshop opened me to a new way of learning about myself. I did not expect to be so moved and to gain so much insight into myself.
I left the workshop, after the discussions and the exercises with the horses, with a peaceful feeling that somehow I was more centred and grounded.
Kaileen and Cindy were supportive and skilful facilitators who guided me through the process. They made it a safe place to open up on an emotional level so that I could truly experience the energy and connection with the horses.
I would personally recommend you to try this wonderful experience – there is nothing like it anywhere!!!!”
Julie E., Toronto, Ontario May 2011

Community:
The other side of Permaculture is the fostering of culture and community. Greenshire is a multi-family intentional community with 13 members, 6 of whom live on the farm. We are always open to considering new members. Greenshire operates as a co-op, where all major decisions are voted on democratically.
At Greenshire we are very passionate about expanding public awareness. We actively engage with the local community through presentations at public events, and our farm tours which are open to the general public, schools, and special interest groups. The tours showcase the Healing Horse Centre and our demonstration gardens that give examples of what people can do in their own backyards.
We have many people come to the farm from as close as down the road, to as far as Europe and the Middle East,  to volunteer and gain new skills and experiences. Some stay for a few days to a week, while others stay for the better part of a year. In the future we plan to offer a multitude of interesting and educational courses and events such as an introduction to permaculture, yoga, meditation, wildlife observation, birding, music, visual arts, dance, shamanism, and astronomy, among others.
We also aspire to build a large Earthship house which will be our central dwelling with multiple units for current and future residents, as well as various styles of  environmentally sound cottages which would be available to non-resident co-op members, the general public, and volunteers.
 

What We Need & What You Get

We'll break it down for you folks in more detail:
We have had the farm for 3.5 years through a short-term mortgage held by the previous owner of the property. The mortgage holders (previous owners) are an extremely generous couple who acquired the property through auction. They had initially made the purchase as a potential future retirement property for themselves and in the mean-time they would rent it out.
We came across the property after an extensive search and it was love at first-sight. The generous couple has since decided it was too much land for their needs and agreed to sell it to us and hold the mortgage.
Since living here we have put enormous amounts of money into establishing the farm (horse shelter, tack room, fencing, gardens, seeds, plants, trees, and equipment, etc.). We have been increasing our income each year, but as you may know it takes a while to get a start-up business to become sustainable and then profitable. 
The short-term mortgage held by the previous owner of the farm is now up and we have been applying for a long-term mortgage through banks and private lenders.
Our farm has been appraised for $347,000 and we are certain that we can secure a farm mortgage for around 70% of this value (banks and lenders typically only give this percentage for farm mortgages) which would be approx $240,000, we owe our current mortgage holder $305,000 and so the difference to pay off our current mortgage holder is somewhere in around $50,000. 
What you get
As a contributor you will get the satisfaction of knowing that you've helped support the practice and promotion of environmentally responsible farming, the care of abused animals, and provided a fun and educational equine-assisted learning and agri-tourism destination to be shared with the community for decades to come!

<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4eowfAvzk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>The Earth &amp; Me</strong></a></span> begins with the quote.  “<em>All things are interconnected.  What befalls the earth befalls the sons and daughters of the earth.  We did not weave the web of life, we are merely a strand in it.  Whatever we do to the web we do to ourselves.”  </em><strong>Chief Seattle</strong></p>
<p><strong>""</strong><a href=""http://shadowboxtheatre.org/shows.html#Earth"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The Earth &amp; Me</span></strong></a> evolved from a poem that I wrote many years ago as a gift to my grandchildren.  My goal: to inspire children to respect, protect and honor the earth — the land, the water, and all its creatures, using the most powerful medium I know – Theatre.  As the show ends the child, affected by the Earth’s plight, sings  “<em>I promise you a new beginning, a new beginning and a hope…Yes, Hand in Hand we all will stand, across the land, yes hand in hand, and ask for peace” </em> And the children in the audience join, and the commitment to the Earth is made."" <strong>Sandra Robbins</strong>, <strong>Founding Director, The Shadow Box Theatre</strong></p>
<p>“I am Sandra Robbins’ eldest grandchild and have just graduated from Cornell University majoring in environmental science. The Shadow box Theatre changed my life and has shaped me in more ways then I can imagine. But more importantly I see the impact it has on each child that is blessed with the opportunity to experience SBT. Children <em>love</em> my grandmother's shows. When I go to her weekday shows full of public school children I am amazed at the reception her theatre receives. They sing, dance, and clap along. In <em>The Earth &amp; Me</em> they all join hands at the end of the show and sing ""Hand in Hand,"" making a commitment to peace and the earth. As a child I remember listening to the sound track of <em>The Earth &amp; Me</em> and re-enacting the whole play with two little stuffed animal seals I had, entertaining myself for hours. I knew all the songs by heart and especially love the closing song, 'Hand in Hand.'</p>
<p>Today when I see who I have become, an outdoor enthusiast and a passionate steward of the natural world as well as an empowered individual with great concern for the earth and its people, I have to look back and thank my many influences, but particularly my grandma, who has always been one of my strongest woman role models. Her passion to bring theatre with important messages to children is a great example of a life's work well spent. When I heard that The Shadow Box Theatre was in a financial crisis due to Hurricane Sandy and considering canceling its spring show of <em>The Earth &amp; Me</em>, I knew I had to help. Now, more then ever, I think children need this show. With many in NYC having seen first hand the darkness brought by extreme weather, children need a message of hope and a guiding light of a way to live in peace and harmony with the earth. This show provides just that and much more. Anyone who experienced the power of theatre and the magic of its’ “Story-telling” as a child, knows that it stays with you forever. Thank you for helping us make this fund raising effort a great success.”  <strong>Miwa Oseki Robbins</strong></p>
<p><em>“When the play [The Earth &amp; Me] was unfortunately over, I put everything in the play together, and I got the message of what the play was trying to say, and it touched my feelings so deeply, it brought tears to my eyes.""</em><em><br/></em><strong>- Student, P.S. 290</strong><em> </em></p>

<p><a href=""http://shadowboxtheatre.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The Shadow Box Theatre</span></em></a> began in 1967 as the brainchild of an extraordinary woman, Sandra Robbins, who dreamed of using light, color, and sound to profoundly touch the creative spirit within each child. Beginning out of a bus, called <em>The Children's Caravan</em>,<em> </em>Sandra Robbins captivated audiences throughout Central and Riverside Park with story-time and shadow puppet shows. Today, The Shadow Box Theatre is a three fold program that provides <a href=""http://shadowboxtheatre.org/shows.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">multimedia puppet shows</span></a>, <a href=""http://shadowboxtheatre.org/workshops.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Theatre Arts Workshops</span></a>, and <a href=""http://shadowboxtheatre.org/bookstore.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Children’s books, audios, and DVDs</span></a> to young audiences.</p>
<p>Primarily serving New York City's children, teachers, and parents, it is the second oldest continuously running children’s theatre in NYC. Its award winning multimedia puppet shows, theatre arts workshops, and children's books, audios, DVDs and teacher guides serve over 30,000 children each year. This multi-ethnic troupe performs and works with inner city children and families, bringing laughter, joy, and affirmation to young audiences. Children not only enjoy the professional shows but SBT also gives them the opportunity to create their own puppets and productions inspired by The Shadow Box Theatre. Two great youtube videos that capture these workshops are here: The <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Shroq-mdai0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">2nd grade</span></a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckc9taVgQWE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">5th grade</span></a> workshops. </p>

<p>SBT's multi-sensory productions have a strong and immediate audio-visual impact on their young audiences. Their ultimate purpose is far-reaching. Children's theatre is more than a dynamic art form - it is a powerful educational tool. Through their synthesis of live interactive theatre, puppetry, song and dance, The Shadow Box Theatre:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fosters self-esteem and social responsibility</li>
<li>Encourages learning through creative expression</li>

<p>Peek in on a Shadow Box Theatre audience and you'll see something like a kid's United Nations, a cross-section of the City's diverse populations. SBT's school shows, with low group ticket rates and convenient weekday schedules, provide a stimulating creative experience for inner city pre-school, elementary, and middle school children. For many, Shadow Box is their first theatrical experience. The interactive nature of the shows allows them to participate regardless of functional level. Elementary, special education, ESL and family audiences alike respond to the vivid sights and sounds of an SBT performance. Because of this direct involvement, Shadow Box Theatre shows have become cherished landmarks in the imaginative lives of their young audiences. Family weekend performances afford an unparalleled opportunity for cross-cultural exchange, drawing a faithful following from the immediate neighborhood and the extended metropolitan area. Shadow Box audiences continue to share their enthusiasm with classmates, friends and family long after the show is over. The impact on one child who sat in the audience years ago was so long-lasting that he went on later to become an SBT performer.</p>
<p>When the recent Hurricane Sandy hit New York City, it brought damage of floods, school closings, show cancellations, and major disruptions, impacting many children and families. As we look forward and see much of New York still suffering in the aftermath, we know we must maintain our plans for our spring production, <em>The Earth &amp; Me</em>, even though, due to the hurricane, it is a fiscal risk. This show feels particularly vital now as it teaches peace and environmental stewardship and brings hope and empowerment to children through the inspiring mediums of story, dance, and song. Although much of the world has moved on from Hurricane Sandy, for the children and families affected by power outages and floods, the pervading darkness and fear around not having a home continues. And for others it is not easily forgotten.</p>
<h2><strong><em>What 2012 Brought: </em></strong></h2>
<h2><strong><em><img alt=""Children sad to see destroyed puppets due to floods"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.numeroff.com/sbt/Flood.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></em></strong></h2>
<p>We all know that the economic downturn has taken its toll on many enterprises, including The Shadow Box Theatre. As a result we entered 2012 with very little money left in the bank for a “rainy day.” Our earnings are a major source of our income and Hurricane Sandy caused us to lose most of our fall season. Because of school closings, disruption in New York City transportation, and cancelled school trips for almost the entire month of November, our fall season was greatly curtailed and resulted in us losing $37,000 in expected revenue. Most recently, our winter season has also gotten off to a challenging start. The school bus strike in NYC means teachers do not have a way to transport their children to our shows. If there are no school buses, there is little to no audience. Already we have had many cancellations of our run of The African Drum, which celebrates African-American History Month. We do not yet know its entire fiscal impact. However, we do know the income loss will be many thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>We now have the choice to either close our doors for the rest of the spring season or to turn to the public for support. We believe the <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The Earth &amp; Me</span> is an important story that our children need to be told at this time and so we are taking the financial risk, and reaching out to you to help us keep SBT's commitment to our young audiences.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Shadow Box Theatre’s primary medium is shadow puppets, which exist because of light. Metaphorically and literally they bring light into the hearts of children through stories of peace and hope.</em></strong></p>
<p><a href=""http://shadowboxtheatre.org/shows.html#Earth"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><em>The Earth &amp; Me</em></a> brings a vital message of empowerment to children using the mediums of music, dance, three dimensional puppetry, magical shadow figures and overhead projections on our shadow screen.  This inspiring production, who’s message, in todays world is so important not only for our young audiences, but for us all to remember, was last performed in 2006. Watch <a href=""http://youtu.be/XM4eowfAvzk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the promo video</a> we created of our first year of producing <em>The Earth &amp; Me</em> for a fuller comprehension of the message.  At that time we were still the Children’s Theatre in Residence at the Brooklyn YWCA. When its policy changed and it became only a residence for women, we had to move. Since then, we have not had the proper space or dance floor to rehearse and perform this show. However, its important message about peace, respect for the Earth, and creating a balanced environment, made us decide to rent rehearsal and performance space and put it back in the repertoire for our 2013 season.  The advent of the hurricane and its impact made this production a fiscal risk but even more cogent. There are many ways to TEACH PEACE!  Theatre is one of the most powerful and memorable. With your financial support we will be able to fulfill our mission. “<em>Hand in Hand” </em><em>we can do it together.</em></p>
<h2><strong><em>Artistic Excellence </em></strong></h2>

<h2><strong>Reviews of The Shadow Box Theatre </strong></h2>
<p>""I arranged for my E.S.L. classes to attend The Earth &amp; Me on (my birthday). It was the best present I could have gotten. We all had such a glorious experience! The presentation is easily understood without a high degree of facility in English. It is perfect for new language learners. If we only have one trip next year, it will certainly be to the Shadow Box Theatre presentation. May you continue your wonderful work."" <br/><em>- Teacher, P.S. 233, Brooklyn</em></p>
<p>""I like how the book explains how the Earth was so quiet until people came along, fighting with each other for land and it's making the Earth get hurt. The bears, butterflies, dolphins, and eagles are all something special to the Earth. I really love the book.""<br/><em>-Student, P.S. 151</em></p>
<p>""Children's theater is refreshing because it does not require the standard protocol of erect postures and silence. When something wows the children, they exhale great bursts of 'ooohs' and 'aaahs.' We adults have to stifle our natural reactions. The Brooklyn YWCA turned into an arena of screeches and yelps Wednesday morning as bigger-than-life butterfly and bumble bee puppets swarmed over the stage, in The Shadow Box Theatre's presentation of The Earth &amp; Me.""<em><br/></em><em>- Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em></p>
<p>""For centuries, children all over the world have been intrigued by shadows. The Shadow Box Theatre is bringing the ancient art form of shadow puppets to children in No Balloons Today. The group seems to have turned a kaleidoscope in such a way that the colorful pieces have formed winsome people, realistic animals and finely etched scenery...The youngsters are included all the way.""          <em>- The New York Times</em></p>
<p>The African Drum: ""Behind the screen, busy hands artfully maneuvered thin poles to manipulate the jointed figures formed from rainbow-hued pieces of plastic. Before the screen, more than 100 youngsters watched delightedly yesterday as striped zebras, spotted leopards, magnificently garbed African warriors, elephants and engaging birds flitted in silhouette across the illuminated screen...For those who think of puppets either on strings or on the hand like a glove, shadow puppetry is a delightful new find with the charm of an animated cartoon.""<br/><em>- The Washington Post</em> <br/><br/> ""This endearing presentation of The African Drum is an ideal way to familiarize children with African folklore. They are transported into a world of colorful tales enhanced by African rhythm and song. And so with this production, the Shadow Box Theatre has found a wonderful way to honor Black History Month.""<br/><em>- The Black American</em> </p>
<p>""I must take a moment to comment on an exceptional program which we at P.S. 30 have experienced...Programs such as SBT's provide an invaluable experience to students who have had very limited exposure to the performing arts. Art as an expression of culture, history, joy, and information, helps children better understand their world.""<br/><em>- Teacher, P.S. 30, Queens</em> </p>

Thank you for a very successfully IndieGoGo run. Our total, as of 3/17/2013 is a little over $10,000! (That is online donations plus offline donation) We could not have done this without you all. Although we can no longer accept donations through IndieGoGo we are still in need of donations and still accepting them.
To donate please send a check made out to The Shadow Box Theatre to Shadow Box Theatre, 325 West End Avenue, Apt. 12B, New York, NY 10023 or call 212-724-0677 to make a donation over the phone. 
As my grandmother said in out last update, ""Though we are noticeably short of our stated goal of $27,000, in good faith, Earth & Me has gone into rehearsal. The opening date is April 17th at Hostos College in the Bronx. We have already booked 3,140 inner city school children to see the show in all 4 boros. Our goal is 6 to 8,000. Hopefully between additional fund raising and ticket sales we will be able to end our season in the black and bring a wonderful show supported by you, our dedicated contributors, to our young audiences."" 
Please Know how deeply appreciative we are of your help. You literally will have inspired many children to care for our earth as well as making many children smile. We hope to see many of you at our performances!
Our Inter-generational joining of hands has made a small miracle happen.Thank You!
Sandra Robbins and Miwa Oseki Robbins, all of us at SBT and the many children we serve 
****************************
The Earth & Me begins with the quote.  “All things are interconnected.  What befalls the earth befalls the sons and daughters of the earth.  We did not weave the web of life, we are merely a strand in it.  Whatever we do to the web we do to ourselves.”  Chief Seattle
""The Earth & Me evolved from a poem that I wrote many years ago as a gift to my grandchildren.  My goal: to inspire children to respect, protect and honor the earth — the land, the water, and all its creatures, using the most powerful medium I know – Theatre.  As the show ends the child, affected by the Earth’s plight, sings  “I promise you a new beginning, a new beginning and a hope…Yes, Hand in Hand we all will stand, across the land, yes hand in hand, and ask for peace”  And the children in the audience join, and the commitment to the Earth is made."" Sandra Robbins, Founding Director, The Shadow Box Theatre
“I am Sandra Robbins’ eldest grandchild and have just graduated from Cornell University majoring in environmental science. The Shadow box Theatre changed my life and has shaped me in more ways then I can imagine. But more importantly I see the impact it has on each child that is blessed with the opportunity to experience SBT. Children love my grandmother's shows. When I go to her weekday shows full of public school children I am amazed at the reception her theatre receives. They sing, dance, and clap along. In The Earth & Me they all join hands at the end of the show and sing ""Hand in Hand,"" making a commitment to peace and the earth. As a child I remember listening to the sound track of The Earth & Me and re-enacting the whole play with two little stuffed animal seals I had, entertaining myself for hours. I knew all the songs by heart and especially love the closing song, 'Hand in Hand.'
Today when I see who I have become, an outdoor enthusiast and a passionate steward of the natural world as well as an empowered individual with great concern for the earth and its people, I have to look back and thank my many influences, but particularly my grandma, who has always been one of my strongest woman role models. Her passion to bring theatre with important messages to children is a great example of a life's work well spent. When I heard that The Shadow Box Theatre was in a financial crisis due to Hurricane Sandy and considering canceling its spring show of The Earth & Me, I knew I had to help. Now, more then ever, I think children need this show. With many in NYC having seen first hand the darkness brought by extreme weather, children need a message of hope and a guiding light of a way to live in peace and harmony with the earth. This show provides just that and much more. Anyone who experienced the power of theatre and the magic of its’ “Story-telling” as a child, knows that it stays with you forever. Thank you for helping us make this fund raising effort a great success.”  Miwa Oseki Robbins
“When the play [The Earth & Me] was unfortunately over, I put everything in the play together, and I got the message of what the play was trying to say, and it touched my feelings so deeply, it brought tears to my eyes.""- Student, P.S. 290 
About The Shadow Box Theatre

The Shadow Box Theatre began in 1967 as the brainchild of an extraordinary woman, Sandra Robbins, who dreamed of using light, color, and sound to profoundly touch the creative spirit within each child. Beginning out of a bus, called The Children's Caravan, Sandra Robbins captivated audiences throughout Central and Riverside Park with story-time and shadow puppet shows. Today, The Shadow Box Theatre is a three fold program that provides multimedia puppet shows, Theatre Arts Workshops, and Children’s books, audios, and DVDs to young audiences.
Primarily serving New York City's children, teachers, and parents, it is the second oldest continuously running children’s theatre in NYC. Its award winning multimedia puppet shows, theatre arts workshops, and children's books, audios, DVDs and teacher guides serve over 30,000 children each year. This multi-ethnic troupe performs and works with inner city children and families, bringing laughter, joy, and affirmation to young audiences. Children not only enjoy the professional shows but SBT also gives them the opportunity to create their own puppets and productions inspired by The Shadow Box Theatre. Two great youtube videos that capture these workshops are here: The 2nd grade and 5th grade workshops. 
SBT’s many shows, range from Lumpy Bumpy Pumpkin, a Halloween tale, to Big Annie, an American folk tale, to The African Drum, a celebration of multicultural sharing, to The Earth & Me, an inspiring tale empowering children to bring peace to the Earth. They model tolerance and respect for diversity, empower children with a positive view of themselves, their world, and their future
SBT's multi-sensory productions have a strong and immediate audio-visual impact on their young audiences. Their ultimate purpose is far-reaching. Children's theatre is more than a dynamic art form - it is a powerful educational tool. Through their synthesis of live interactive theatre, puppetry, song and dance, The Shadow Box Theatre:

Fosters self-esteem and social responsibility
Encourages learning through creative expression
Supports ethnic pride and cross-cultural sharing
Promotes a safe and healthy lifestyle
Teaches the hazards of drugs, alcohol and tobacco
Provides tools for change in a troubled environment
Offers a lasting message of hope and peace
                        
Peek in on a Shadow Box Theatre audience and you'll see something like a kid's United Nations, a cross-section of the City's diverse populations. SBT's school shows, with low group ticket rates and convenient weekday schedules, provide a stimulating creative experience for inner city pre-school, elementary, and middle school children. For many, Shadow Box is their first theatrical experience. The interactive nature of the shows allows them to participate regardless of functional level. Elementary, special education, ESL and family audiences alike respond to the vivid sights and sounds of an SBT performance. Because of this direct involvement, Shadow Box Theatre shows have become cherished landmarks in the imaginative lives of their young audiences. Family weekend performances afford an unparalleled opportunity for cross-cultural exchange, drawing a faithful following from the immediate neighborhood and the extended metropolitan area. Shadow Box audiences continue to share their enthusiasm with classmates, friends and family long after the show is over. The impact on one child who sat in the audience years ago was so long-lasting that he went on later to become an SBT performer.
When the recent Hurricane Sandy hit New York City, it brought damage of floods, school closings, show cancellations, and major disruptions, impacting many children and families. As we look forward and see much of New York still suffering in the aftermath, we know we must maintain our plans for our spring production, The Earth & Me, even though, due to the hurricane, it is a fiscal risk. This show feels particularly vital now as it teaches peace and environmental stewardship and brings hope and empowerment to children through the inspiring mediums of story, dance, and song. Although much of the world has moved on from Hurricane Sandy, for the children and families affected by power outages and floods, the pervading darkness and fear around not having a home continues. And for others it is not easily forgotten.
What 2012 Brought: 

We all know that the economic downturn has taken its toll on many enterprises, including The Shadow Box Theatre. As a result we entered 2012 with very little money left in the bank for a “rainy day.” Our earnings are a major source of our income and Hurricane Sandy caused us to lose most of our fall season. Because of school closings, disruption in New York City transportation, and cancelled school trips for almost the entire month of November, our fall season was greatly curtailed and resulted in us losing $37,000 in expected revenue. Most recently, our winter season has also gotten off to a challenging start. The school bus strike in NYC means teachers do not have a way to transport their children to our shows. If there are no school buses, there is little to no audience. Already we have had many cancellations of our run of The African Drum, which celebrates African-American History Month. We do not yet know its entire fiscal impact. However, we do know the income loss will be many thousands of dollars.
We now have the choice to either close our doors for the rest of the spring season or to turn to the public for support. We believe the The Earth & Me is an important story that our children need to be told at this time and so we are taking the financial risk, and reaching out to you to help us keep SBT's commitment to our young audiences.
The Shadow Box Theatre’s primary medium is shadow puppets, which exist because of light. Metaphorically and literally they bring light into the hearts of children through stories of peace and hope.
The Earth & Me brings a vital message of empowerment to children using the mediums of music, dance, three dimensional puppetry, magical shadow figures and overhead projections on our shadow screen.  This inspiring production, who’s message, in todays world is so important not only for our young audiences, but for us all to remember, was last performed in 2006. Watch the promo video we created of our first year of producing The Earth & Me for a fuller comprehension of the message.  At that time we were still the Children’s Theatre in Residence at the Brooklyn YWCA. When its policy changed and it became only a residence for women, we had to move. Since then, we have not had the proper space or dance floor to rehearse and perform this show. However, its important message about peace, respect for the Earth, and creating a balanced environment, made us decide to rent rehearsal and performance space and put it back in the repertoire for our 2013 season.  The advent of the hurricane and its impact made this production a fiscal risk but even more cogent. There are many ways to TEACH PEACE!  Theatre is one of the most powerful and memorable. With your financial support we will be able to fulfill our mission. “Hand in Hand” we can do it together.
Artistic Excellence 

The artistic excellence of these works is exemplified by the recognition we have received over the years and the continuing demand for our productions from teachers and parents. We have received broad and critical acclaim for the high caliber and artistic staging of our works in The New York Times, Newsday, New York Daily News, Amsterdam News, New York Parent Magazine, El Diario and other media, and CBS Evening News, NY- 1 (Parenting Segment) and local television have featured us. We have made featured appearances at Lincoln Center, Brooklyn Academy of Music, Symphony Space, Emelin Theatre, Sylvia and Danny Kaye Playhouse, Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC, American Museum of Natural History, the Brooklyn Museum, and other cultural institutions. In addition, SBT has appeared on Mister Roger's Neighborhood, Vegetable Soup, Romper Room and the PBS special anniversary production, Kids 13.
The Shadow Box Theatre has received multiple awards such as from the Office of the New York State Governor Mario Cuomo, Office of New York City Mayor Rudolf Giuliani, the Public Health Association of New York, the First Manufacturer’s Hanover Community Service Award, Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center, and the Metropolitan Hospital Center. It has created an educational video for the New York City Department of Transportation and the theatre’s books, CDs, and DVDs for children have received excellent reviews from the American Library Association’s Booklist, the School Library Journal, and an ALA “Children’s Notable Recording” award for How The Turtle Got Its Shell.

The association unites anthropologists, biologists, agronomists, ethnobotanists, curanderos and Amazon medicine experts. Since beginning 2015, we have been working together with EcoCentro project in Puerto Maldonado - located in the Madre de Dios region - in the middle of Peruvian Amazonia. We contributed to the project by making a botanic garden with medical plants. We also created a center dedicated to activities like educational workshops, sustainable tourism and experiential seminars concerning the use of medical plants and the related respect to be given to the locals’ knowledge and tradition.</p><h2><strong>THE PROJECT</strong></h2><p>‘Amazon Calling’ is a project aiming to build a plant nursery capable of producing 10,000 plants a year. Plants will partly be used to increase the botanical species kept inside Amarumayo botanical garden. Some others will instead be used to make phytotherapeutic treatments. However the majority of plants will be gifted to farmers - belonging to the Ecological Agriculture Association - in the Madre de Dios region. That will implement their fields by adding edible, wooden plants as well as medicinal plants.</p><h2>SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT</h2><p><strong>-    Spread and saving</strong> of plants with acknowledged medical value.</p><p><strong>-    Protecting</strong> a thousand-year old medical tradition</p><p><strong>-    Doing research</strong> on medicinal plants</p><p><strong>-    Doing development</strong> on Amarumayo botanical garden and its related activities.</p><p><strong>-    Developing agroforestry and analog forestry</strong> including medicinal plants. That aiming to both save and spread knowledge and on the other hand to have a positive impact on local economy. Farmers will in fact be given the possibility of selling plant-related material - like leaves, flowers, bark and roots -  to people who produce natural remedies.</p><p><strong>Agroforestry:</strong> this activity focuses on the ecological system and the sustainable use of natural resources. Its target is to diversify the agricultural system through the integration of trees. Earth’s resources would be used to enforce production. That will lead to an increase of social, economical and environmental benefits. Agroforestry systems thus succeed in combining together the ecological and economical value of wooden trees, plantations and farm animals.</p><p><strong>Analog Forestry</strong><strong>:</strong> likewise agroforestry, it reproduces a similar type of ecosystem though inside of an architectural structure. Plants’ ecological features will here be similar to the ones of the original vegetation.

It is currently hosting a variety of non-profit organisations like: Etnopharmakon, Asociación de Agricultura Ecológica, Ecodely, La Charcita del Arte, La Planta. Thanks to these associations’ contribution Ecocentro has acquired a pivotal role to all people interested in sustainable lifestyles and production systems that are environmentally and culturally friendly. Synergy among the organisations has managed to achieve lots of goals year by year. Many projects - such as educational workshops, involvement with schools, experiential seminars, sustainable tourism, craftsmanship, agroforestry, foresteria analoga, ecological farming, production of bio-fertiliser, phytotherapeutic remedies, biological products and much more yet to come - were activated through collaboration and the common certainty that keeping a respectful attitude toward surrounding people and environment is the right path to follow.</p><h2>CONTEXT</h2><p>Biodiversity in the <strong>Madre de Dios region</strong> currently is one of the vastest in the world. It is though also affected by dramatic levels of environmental risk. That occurring to an area where culture and nature are sticked together in an ancient and profound bond and consequently leading to critical cultural emergency. Such connection is seen in traditional medical practises that involve the local plants in a unique way. For too many years the region has been subject to the irresponsible and undiscriminating exploitation - gold and wood above all - of its natural resources. That is doing critical damage to both the region’s extraordinary biological balance, and people themselves  whose culture outstandingly exemplifies the ideal of a harmonic relationship between man and nature. Thousands hectares of forest are yearly taken down in favour to building illegal gold mines as well as the trade of wood, growing spread of monocultures and intensive farming. Rivers are being poisoned by mercury that is used in mines and then recklessly disposed into their waters. That leads to contamination of the river’s fauna and the related food chain. Children are illegally trafficked for prostitution and exploited to work. The lack of respect for life daily generates these and many other appalling side-effects in the Madre de Dios region. Local and international authorities and institutions are dealing inefficiently with the problem and they don’t fight against a situation that is risking to erase a priceless biological and cultural heritage.</p><p>The project is therefore born aiming to face both environmental and cultural controversies by spreading knowledge of the region’s therapeutic culture and giving value to Madre de Dios biodiversity which currently is one of the most incredible gifts mankind owns on this planet, though we are letting it disappear without ever really having the opportunity to know it for real.</p><h2>PERKS</h2><p><strong>ADOPTION CERTIFICATE</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481748601/qnevihswzi6ggw3oeht6.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>DIGITAL:</strong> an email with a personalized adoption certificate</p><p><strong>PAPER:</strong> a letter with the certificate of adoption printed with ecological inks on growing paper, from which will be born  ""forget-me-nots""</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481748969/ulr7g67jlthb0fzyvfwf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>ETNOPHARMAKON TEXTILE</strong></p><p>A textile with circular Etnopharmakon’s logo.

The association unites anthropologists, biologists, agronomists, ethnobotanists, curanderos and Amazon medicine experts. Since beginning 2015, we have been working together with EcoCentro project in Puerto Maldonado - located in the Madre de Dios region - in the middle of Peruvian Amazonia. We contributed to the project by making a botanic garden with medical plants. We also created a center dedicated to activities like educational workshops, sustainable tourism and experiential seminars concerning the use of medical plants and the related respect to be given to the locals’ knowledge and tradition.THE PROJECT‘Amazon Calling’ is a project aiming to build a plant nursery capable of producing 10,000 plants a year. Plants will partly be used to increase the botanical species kept inside Amarumayo botanical garden. Some others will instead be used to make phytotherapeutic treatments. However the majority of plants will be gifted to farmers - belonging to the Ecological Agriculture Association - in the Madre de Dios region. That will implement their fields by adding edible, wooden plants as well as medicinal plants.SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT-    Spread and saving of plants with acknowledged medical value.-    Protecting a thousand-year old medical tradition-    Doing research on medicinal plants-    Doing development on Amarumayo botanical garden and its related activities.-    Developing agroforestry and analog forestry including medicinal plants. That aiming to both save and spread knowledge and on the other hand to have a positive impact on local economy. Farmers will in fact be given the possibility of selling plant-related material - like leaves, flowers, bark and roots -  to people who produce natural remedies.Agroforestry: this activity focuses on the ecological system and the sustainable use of natural resources. Its target is to diversify the agricultural system through the integration of trees. Earth’s resources would be used to enforce production. That will lead to an increase of social, economical and environmental benefits. Agroforestry systems thus succeed in combining together the ecological and economical value of wooden trees, plantations and farm animals.Analog Forestry: likewise agroforestry, it reproduces a similar type of ecosystem though inside of an architectural structure. Plants’ ecological features will here be similar to the ones of the original vegetation. Analog forestry is a more complete version of agroforestry, therefore including multiple layers and many kinds of complex interactions among dozens of cultivated species. That lets it have a very similar look to the current original forest. Analog forestry thus enforces rural communities both socially and economically.PURPOSE OF THE CROWDFUNDINGLOCATIONEcoCentro (Puerto Maldonado, calle rompeolas km 3.2) is a multifunctional structure created in 2001.

Desde el comienzo de 2015 colaboramos con el proyecto EcoCentro en la ciudad de Puerto Maldonado, en la región de Madre de Dios, en medio de la Amazonía peruana a través de la creación de un jardín botánico de plantas medicinales y de un centro dedicado a la organización de talleres educativos,turismo responsable y talleres vivenciales con las plantas medicinales en el respeto de los conocimientos y tradiciones locales. EL PROYECTOEl proyecto 'Amazon Calling' tiene como objetivo la construcción de un vivero capaz de producir 10.000 plantas medicinales por año.Parte de las plantas cultivadas se utilizarán para aumentar las especies de plantas que se conservan en jardín botánico Amarumayo. Otras se utilizarán para la preparación de remedios fitoterapéuticos.La mayoría serán entregados a los agricultores de la región Madre de Dios (agrupados en la Asociación de Agricultura Ecológica) para que puedan poner implementar sus campos, además que con plantas de madera y comestibles, también con plantas medicinales.IMPACTO SOCIOAMBIENTAL- Conservación y difusión de las plantas de valor médico reconocido- Protección de una tradición médica milenaria- Investigación sobre plantas medicinales- El desarrollo del Jardín Botánico Amarumayo y de las actividades conexas- El desarrollo de sistemas agroforestales y de foresteria análoga que incluyan  plantas medicinales en la perspectiva, por un lado de preservar y difundir el conocimiento y, por otra, para tener un impacto en la economía local, con la posibilidad, por parte de los agricultores, de vender material vegetal (hojas, flores, raíces, corteza, etc.) a los productores de remedios naturalesAgroforestería: el propósito de esta práctica consiste en una gestión basada en los sistemas ecológicos y el uso sostenible de los recursosnaturales que a través de la integración de los árboles en el sistema agrícola diversifica y sostiene la producción para aumentar losbeneficios sociales, económicos y ambientales del uso de la tierra en todos los niveles. Por lo tanto, los sistemas agroforestales se caracterizan por interacciones ecológicas y económicas entre los árboles leñosos, cultivos y ganado.Foresteria Análoga: es un sistema que trata de reproducir ecosistemas análogos en estructura arquitectónica y funciones ecológicas de la vegetación original. Es similar a la agroforestería, pero más complejo y completo, ya que las múltiples capas y las complejas interacciones entre las decenas de especies cultivadas lo hacen, de hecho, similar a la vista del bosque actual. Este sistema refuerza la comunidad rural, tanto social como económicamente¿CÓMO SE UTILIZARÁ EL DINERO RECAUDADO?DONDE ESTAMOSEcoCentro (Puerto Maldonado, calle rompeolas del 3,2 km), es una estructura polivalente creada en 2001 y que, al día de hoy, es el hogar de variasorganizaciones sin ánimo de lucro, incluyendo: Etnopharmakon, la Asociación de Agricultura Ecológica, Ecodely, La Charcita del Arte, La Planta. Gracias a lacolaboración entre todas estas asociaciones Ecocentro se convirtió en un punto crucial para todos los interesados en un estilo de vida y a formas de producción sostenibles y respetuosos del medioambiente y de las diferentes culturas. Talleres educativos, proyectos con las escuelas, talleres vivenciales, turismo responsable, la artesanía, la agroforestería, la foresteria análoga , la agricultura ecológica, la producción de bio-fertilizantes, de remedios fitoterapéuticos, deproductos biológicos... todo esto y mucho más es lo que, en los últimos años se ha logrado activar gracias al trabajo colaborativo y a la certeza de que vivir enuna forma que respete el medio ambiente y los demás es el mejor camino a seguir.EL CONTEXTOMadre de Dios es actualmente una de las regiones con mayor biodiversidad en el mundo, pero por desgracia, es también una de las regiones con el mayor grado de riesgo ambiental, que también se convierte en una emergencia cultural en una zona donde la cultura y la naturaleza tienen un vínculo todavía profundo y antiguo que se manifiesta sobre todo en las prácticas médicas tradicionales, caracterizadas por el uso exclusivo de las plantas locales. El saqueo indiscriminado e irresponsable de sus recursos - en primer lugar el oro y la madera - que sufre ya desde demasiados años, tiene las proporciones de una devastación que está comprometiendo irremediablemente su extraordinario equilibrio biológico humano y la cultura del hombre de la que es su manifestación tan directa que representa un ejemplo único de la relación armoniosa entre el hombre y la naturaleza. Son, en efecto, miles cada año, las hectáreas de bosque destruido por el aumento de la minería de oro ilegal, el comercio de madera ilegal, la creciente expansión de los monocultivos y la ganadería intensiva. El envenenamiento de los ríos debido a la eliminación imprudente de mercurio utilizado en las minas, lo que resulta en la contaminación del pescado y la cadena alimentaria a eso asociada, la explotación del trabajo infantil y la trata de niños vinculados a la prostitución, son algunos de los horribles efectos secundarios de esta total falta de respeto a la vida en todas sus formas, y se manifiestan a diario en la región de Madre de Dios. La acción de las autoridades e instituciones locales e internacionales es desafortunadamente al día de hoy insuficiente e ineficaz- si no hasta cómplice - para contrarrestar esta situación que amenaza con acabar con un patrimonio biológico y cultural de inestimable valor.El proyecto nace, por lo tanto, con la idea de intervenir, actuando conjuntamente en dos frentes: el del medio ambiente y el del patrimonio cultural, favoreciendo el conocimiento en una perspectiva de integración, tanto a nivel local como internacional, de una cultura  terapéutica y de una variedad naturalistica que es actualmente una de las riquezas más extraordinarias que el hombre posee en esta tierra, y que estamos culpablemente dejando desaparecer sin ni siquiera haberla conocida realmente.",5.0,0,"2 Campaigns

While the daily life of Huntington Beach swirls around it, what is left of Historic Wintersburg tells the story of old California, Orange County agriculture, faith, and of California's Japanese Americans.”We are inviting you to save rare American history!It began with a little curiosity: what exactly were “those old buildings” at the corner of Warner Avenue and Nichols Lane in Huntington Beach, California?What came afterwards prompted local residents to come forward in an effort to save a remarkable historic property that had been hiding in plain sight for decades.
The story
The Historic Wintersburg blog was created in February 2012, www.HistoricWintersburg.blogspot.com  The book, Historic Wintersburg in Huntington Beach, was published by History Press in March 2014.  The research continues and more stories unfold!Historic Wintersburg contains stories of Japanese pioneers in Orange County, an historic goldfish and flower farm, and a pioneer community effort that founded one of the oldest Japanese missions in California.  The Wintersburg Mission is part of the unrecognized Japanese Mission Trail that began in the late 1880s in San Francisco and made its way down the Pacific coast to Wintersburg Village by 1904.  The pioneers who settled Orange County together survived drought, earthquakes, flood, World War I, Spanish Flu, and the giddy rush of people coming to Southern California, to the land of oranges and beautiful beaches.  Historic Wintersburg is the story of all of us.Historic Wintersburg also is a rare Japanese-owned property that survived California’s Alien Land Laws of 1913 and 1920, and the traumatic upheaval of World War II.  Everyone associated with the Historic Wintersburg property—farmers, merchants, clergy and congregation, including American citizens—was forcibly evacuated from California and confined during World War II.  Historic Wintersburg is a tangible icon of the brave pioneer settlement of the American West and the struggle for civil liberties.Wintersburg Japanese Presbyterian Mission, founded in 1904, at gathering in 1910. These are among the six buildings still standing at Historic Wintersburg. Photo courtesy of Wintersburg Presbyterian Church. © All rights reserved.Historic Wintersburg was named in June 2014 as one of America’s 11 Most Endangered Historic Places by the National Trust for Historic Preservation.  It is the first time an Orange County historical property has made the list in its three-decade long history and the only property named in the western continental United States.   Historic Wintersburg was re-zoned by its current property owner to commercial / industrial zoning, along with a plan for demolition.   It is endangered with complete demolition of all six historic structures on the property by May 2015, unless financial support helps us save it.Photo of Yukiko and Charles Furuta in front of their bungalow in Wintersburg Village, 1912. This is among the six buildings still standing at Historic Wintersburg. Photo courtesy of Furuta family. © All rights reserved.Going for the National Register: All six of the structures on the 4 ½-acre property are considered eligible for the National Register of Historic Places: the 1910 Wintersburg Japanese Presbyterian Mission and manse (parsonage); the 1934 Wintersburg Japanese Presbyterian Church; the last remaining pioneer barn in Huntington Beach, circa 1908-1912; the 1912 Furuta bungalow; and the 1947 post-World War II Furuta ranch house.“Historic Wintersburg is a unique cultural site that tells the important story of early Japanese American immigrants as they sought to make a new life and build a community in Southern California,” said Stephanie Meeks, president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, “We strongly support a collaborative effort that preserves Wintersburg’s historic landscape while building upon its longstanding role as an educational and supportive space for the Huntington Beach community.”In 2013, the U.S. Department of the Interior introduced with the U.S. Park Service a new Asian American Pacific Islander heritage theme study, to identify and find ways to preserve Asian American historical sites.  Less than 3 percent of all National Register listings represent places associated with diverse cultural groups, according to the National Trust.  You have a chance to help us save one of these rare American heritage places! Don’t let this pioneer history be erased!

FUNDRAISING GOALSImmediate goal: $50,000The immediate, critical path need for the preservation of Historic Wintersburg is funding of a $35,000 Urban Land Institute technical advisory* and professional stabilization of the six buildings at Historic Wintersburg.Urban Land Institute technical advisory: This analysis of the property is conducted by a multidisciplinary and balanced team of builders, developers, preservationists, historians, real estate finance professionals, and planners provides a land use planning proof-of-concept document explaining how the historic features on the property can be preserved, while incorporating adaptive reuse.  This report is the tool that shows potential partners how historic preservation works in a financially viable and economically productive approach.  It provides the ""road map"" to a restored, beautiful and vibrant Historic Wintersburg!Professional stabilization: The funds used for stabilization of the buildings will go toward removal of debris or ephemera that may degrade the buildings before preservation, tree trimming, branch and brush clearing near buildings, and any additional security measures that may help stabilize the structures, which, according to a recent inspection by representatives from the U.S. Park Service retain “remarkable integrity” and can be beautifully restored.*ALL DONORS who help us meet the mid-point goal of $35,000 before October 31, 2014; will have their name in the final Urban Land Institute (ULI) technical study as an underwriter.  This report will be circulated nationally.Photo of Depression-era Wintersburg Japanese Presbyterian Church, circa 1934. This is among the six buildings still standing at Historic Wintersburg. Photograph courtesy of Wintersburg Presbyterian Church. © All rights reserved.Long-term objective:We will work with partners to acquire the Historic Wintersburg property from the current landowner, who is willing to sell.  We currently are working with the National Trust for Historic Preservation to reach out to potential partners in preservation.  The 4 1/2-acre property may be valued at approximately $5 million (the Urban Land Institute report will provide an assessment).Additional contributions that exceed the immediate $50,000 goal will go to the dedicated Historic Wintersburg Preservation Fund, which has public oversight.  This funding helps the Historic Wintersburg Preservation Task Force work with other financial partners to buy the property and begin its restoration.  Collaborative partnerships can reduce preservation costs. All funds raised are dedicated solely to the ongoing preservation work (stabilization, expert restoration, archaeological work on the property, public education programs, long-term stewardship and maintenance).About your donation
The Historic Wintersburg Preservation Task Force has applied for a 501c3 nonprofit designation.  The Preservation Fund has both City and Public oversight and is dedicated solely to the preservation of Historic Wintersburg.  We are considered a charitable donation today under our current organization, per IRS Code, 26 U.S.C.170(c)(1).

<p>Our group consists of six researchers, who are living, working and studying in Berlin/ Germany. Four of us are students of environmental engineering and one is student of fine arts focused in cultural science. Our interdisciplinary group will focalize on the growing copper and gold mining industry, combined with the cultural background of nomad’s life in Mongolia which we intend to study from July until August.</p>
<p>The goal of our project is to analyze this aspect from a socio-ecological perspective by visiting two different mining areas and talking to the surrounding residents. Our documentation about mining, especially about Copper- and Gold mining and their influence on nature and humans will consist of recorded interviews, photographies and video films. We will focus on the environmental impact, like water scarcity and changes in the flora. Also we are interested in changes concerning the nomad’s lifestyle as Mongolian nomads managed to maintain their lifestyle throughout a vast period of time and global changes. Are they changing their way of life now with the mining boom in Mongolia? Using their knowledge we would like to raise awareness on that topic.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>In our interviews we will ask questions like:</b></p>
<p>Changes in the life of nomads:<i>i</i>the life of nomads:</p>
<p>- What do you know about mining? Have you been informed by the government or the companies about mining? What did you experience?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- What has changed in recent years in your nomadic life? How did elder generations live in this landscape?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Did you experience any conflicts between mining companies and nomads? Whom can you contact in case of conflicts?</p>
<p>Changes in the environment:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Did the scenery generally change (because of mining) in the last 10 years?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Did water supply areas or grazing areas change? What is the water situation today compared to the past?</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>We need 6.500 Euro for our project. We expect following expenses:</b></p>

</ul><p>
</p><p><b>The importance of our project for you and us:</b></p>
<p>When new mining areas are being developed, theoretically there is always the chance to minimize the negative socio-ecological impact directly from the beginning rather than repeating former  mistakes over and over again and dealing with the consequences afterwards. But taking precautions always reduces profit so that in cases of slack governmental regulations future impact is not considered. Especially in such cases a sensitive community is indispensable.</p>
<p>As consumers we are part of the resource cycle, as gold and copper are essential when it comes to electric devices and their lifecycle. In industrialized countries a life without all these electronic helpers is unthinkable. But we have to realize, it has its price. What is the price?</p>
<p>In order to find out we will record interviews with people from local communities. We intend to record the actual state and the environmental and social (especially for the nomadic living people) changes caused by the intensive mining during the last 10 years. Hereby we provide information about the circumstances under which resources are produced. We want to learn how the nomads, who have managed to maintain their lifestyle in this globalized world, deal with the mining boom in Mongolia.  Based on their knowledge we wish to help out with information and links between mining and water scarcity or airborne pollutants etc. We want to communicate the results of our research and raise awareness to consumers too by putting together a documentary. This way we hope to contribute to a sensitized local community and consumers. </p>
<p>Our cultural scientist Mady Piesold will support the documentary with her special knowledge. During 2011 she was already involved in documentary work and analyzed the cultural changes and assimilation of the native population in Alaska.  The results of her work were presented in several exhibitions and lectures. </p>

Different brainteaser/puzzle toy (onison togloom) for all ages, handmade of wood. 


Shagai is a game of skill, made of ankle bones from sheep and goat. Mongolians exchange shagai as tokens of friendship. It has four possible sides (horse, camel, sheep and goat).

The importance of our project for you and us:
When new mining areas are being developed, theoretically there is always the chance to minimize the negative socio-ecological impact directly from the beginning rather than repeating former  mistakes over and over again and dealing with the consequences afterwards. But taking precautions always reduces profit so that in cases of slack governmental regulations future impact is not considered. Especially in such cases a sensitive community is indispensable.
As consumers we are part of the resource cycle, as gold and copper are essential when it comes to electric devices and their lifecycle. In industrialized countries a life without all these electronic helpers is unthinkable. But we have to realize, it has its price. What is the price?
In order to find out we will record interviews with people from local communities. We intend to record the actual state and the environmental and social (especially for the nomadic living people) changes caused by the intensive mining during the last 10 years. Hereby we provide information about the circumstances under which resources are produced. We want to learn how the nomads, who have managed to maintain their lifestyle in this globalized world, deal with the mining boom in Mongolia.  Based on their knowledge we wish to help out with information and links between mining and water scarcity or airborne pollutants etc. We want to communicate the results of our research and raise awareness to consumers too by putting together a documentary. This way we hope to contribute to a sensitized local community and consumers. 
Our cultural scientist Mady Piesold will support the documentary with her special knowledge. During 2011 she was already involved in documentary work and analyzed the cultural changes and assimilation of the native population in Alaska.  The results of her work were presented in several exhibitions and lectures. 
Besides giving us financial support you can help us to broadcast the idea of our campaign and this platform with all information about our projects.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><span style=""color: #98B3F0;"">Our Vision on Climate</span></h3>
<p>Climate has been on the international scene and in the news for more than 20 years now. <strong>But, have you ever wondered what we actually know about the climate?</strong> If you wanted to know more about it, where would you go? Do you know of a media which gives a serious, reliable and understandable access to climate science to everyone? Something you can really trust on this important and highly controversial topic? Something which is not just an opinion, but which is solidly based on the best science available?</p>
<p>We would like to offer the <strong>best science available to everyone in an understandable manner</strong> by building a direct bridge between citizens and climate scientists around the world. We think that it is of the utmost importance that everyone has <strong>free and reliable access</strong> to what climate scientists know on climate and that everyone can <strong>ask questions to climate scientists and get answers</strong>. We believe that we can achieve this together and that it may help everyone shape a positive future for themselves and for their children.
</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><span style=""color: #98B3F0;"">Goals of Climanosco</span></h3>
<p>The goals of Climanosco are:</p>
<ul>
<li>To provide free access to high quality climate science to everyone in non-scientific language.</li>
<li>To allow citizens to engage in the process of making climate science and of communicating it. </li>
<li>To provide a direct channel to raise questions related to climate science and obtain answers from active climate scientists.</li>
<li>To offer scientists a reliable channel for communicating their research to the public.</li>
</ul>
<p>All our decisions and actions taken in pursuing these goals are based on three pillars:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Independence and neutrality</li>
<li>Individual participation</li>
<li>Highest scientific standards</li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><span style=""color: #98B3F0;"">How do we want to achieve our goals?</span></h3>
<p>It’s quite simple! We open the door for you and all interested people to engage in the communication of science and in the making of science. <b>We connect citizens and climate scientists, allow their interaction and publish resulting climate articles.
</b>To support these activities, we are developing an <b>innovative platform</b> which structures the community’s interactions and allows the free publication of articles. Here is an overview of the types of interaction it allows:</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<h3><span style=""color: #98B3F0;"">Climate Articles…</span></h3>
<p>The climate articles will open the door to the inside of the world of climate science, all in <b>non-scientific language</b>. They will bring readers directly to the frontier between what we know and what we don’t know today as human beings. You will discover this frontier, its challenges, the avenues that are being explored. You will find out how existing paradigms are questioned and re-evaluated by the scientists, as research develops. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><span style=""color: #98B3F0;"">… and Arts</span></h3>
<p>As humans, our perception and understanding go through the channels of our senses. Arts provide sensible and human perspectives on thematics, which even if very abstract, can support the process of acquiring knowledge. <b>Arts and sciences are to work together</b> at Climanosco. Although this aspect will be developed in the next phase, we are readily establishing the connection by having our two artists Barbara Glazar and Ryan James associated to this campaign. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><span style=""color: #98B3F0;"">How this story started…</span></h3>
<p>Ideas emerged and developed over time through discussions between colleagues, friends and scientists that all had one common idea: to make climate knowledge more accessible. Then in 2014, the ideas took a coherent shape and we started to build a functional web site and an initial, yet worldwide community. Earlier this year, we defined our name, Climanosco, and founded a <b>non-profit association</b> that is registered in Zurich. We now have a Board of Directors, a scientific Editorial Board and about 60 members all around the world.</p>

plants and animals live solely on private land. We can’t begin to fully
understand species distributions and how to best conserve rare species without thorough
inventories of private property, but biologists have, by and far, only been
surveying public land for decades. One of the reasons private lands have not
been surveyed is because private landowners have not been invited to do so or
they haven’t known how. Rate My Land (RML) will offer the invitation and walk a
landowner through the process. Rate My Land will try and tackle other roadblocks too (like
the financial burden!). It’s time for RML to change the norm and foster a new
wave of private landowners who are exploring the biodiversity on their land
with the help of biologists. </p><p> </p>

<p>Join with us to develop a fully-functioning website that offers education, resources, connection to biological consultants, rewards, and incentives to private landowners - empowering them to engage in conservation and have their land formally surveyed. Our goal is to create a social norm where it is commonplace and esteemed for private landowners to have their land biologically surveyed. Will you help get this project off the ground? Spread the word, make a donation...it's only through collective ""small"" steps of action that, together, we'll make a big impact and turn the tide of species loss. <br/></p><p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/></b></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/326295/files/20140123162125-what_we_need_what_you_get_copy.png?1390522885"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>We are requesting funds to develop a

<p>To thank you for your support and encourage your
donation, I have rounded up some great perks. Two botanical gardens have
donated admission tickets, friends Seth and May Bernard and Ken Scott (see beautiful photo below) have
donated some of their talented artwork in support of the Rate My Land campaign.
With a large donation, you can be one of the Rate My Land forerunners and have the
botanical diversity of your land assessed by me this summer. Fellow botanists have helped me assemble excellent plant photographs that I have put into a quick reference, pocket field guide. You could elect to
sport an RML t-shirt that asks, “Do you know what’s on your land?” or an RML bumper

our data for public lands, or roughly 40% of the country. For the country as a whole,
private land included, the gaps are chasms. Unfortunately, the majority of
private landowners have not had biological surveys conducted on their land, either
fearing regulation or uncertain on how to initiate the process.  Rate My Land will address these fears and make

<p>Biological surveys provide data on the number and condition of populations,
the ranges occupied by species, population trends and dynamics, and they
identify threats from non-native pests. This data is foundational to species
conservation and land management. A great potential for reversing species loss
and restoring biodiversity lies in engaging private landowners. This will face
challenges and roadblocks—finances, ideological hesitations, and lack of motivation.
Rate My Land is an attempt to bring about new incentives that push past these
roadblocks. Our vision for RML is that it will grow to be an entity that lobbies
government agencies to initiate new monetary incentives (and expand the reach
of existing ones) for landowners engaging in conservation. We see RML creating
new incentives internally by raising the value and desire for high quality land
and biodiversity through focused educational campaigns and collaborations with
real-estate agencies. Rate My Land will be an advocate for landowners by
petitioning governmental agencies to establish assurances that managing their land to help rare species will not lead to further regulations. When
people interact with Rate My Land, we want them to feel inspired and motivated
to join and take action. We hope that every action they take, every new creature
they learn to see and call by name, will lead them further down the road as an
advocate for biodiversity.</p>
<p>Consulting
companies will pay a small fee to use the standardized RML inventory forms as a

</div>
<p>We are volunteers who are part of a campaign to raise awareness in Peru about a series of dams being constructed on the Marañón River, the largest volume contributor of the Amazon River.</p>
<p>Socially and ecologically speaking, the Marañon, home of the ""Grand Canyon of South America,"" is one of the most important rivers in the world. It supports a huge variety of endemic and endangered species spanning numerous ecosystems from high-alpine Andean terrain through the jungles of the Amazon. It is also home to more than 100,000 Peruvians and native Amazonian communities. The electricity from the proposed dams is slated mostly for use in Brazil and in a large -- and controversial -- Peruvian mining operation. A number of the dams to be constructed are ""megadams"" (&gt;1000MW), which will create reservoirs that flood huge areas and displace many local people. These impacts will extend beyond the local environment as the effects of damming this river and adjusting flows and sediment supply will be significant throughout the Amazon. <br/>

The base cost of this 18 day expedition is roughly $13,000 and includes transport, food, and equipment rental. We are covering our own costs for the trip, but are asking for help to support the Peruvians and other volunteer raft guides.</p>
<p>The raft expedition is just the first part of this project, though. Conservamos por Naturaleza is budgeting a further $7000 to produce a high quality documentary and promote it in Peru following the trip. As a team of volunteers, we're hoping to raise over $20,000, but the sky is the limit -- any additional money raised will go towards promoting awareness of the issue in Peru and running a follow-up publicity campaign to try and create the political will necessary to mitigate the harm that comes to the Marañon.</p>

The risk with this campaign is that we go on this trip and create a powerful documentary, but nobody sees it. This is why we need as much support as we can get.

<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This is where the bees will live.</span> </blockquote><h2>Lusted Road Honey Co. &amp; Humblebee Pollinator Conservatory - Sandy, Oregon</h2><p>Thank you for taking a look at this fundraising effort. My name is Dena Rash Guzman. I am a published poet, essayist and work as a writer and reporter for the organic food industry. Born in Las Vegas, Nevada, I now make my home on my family's 60 acre sustainable permaculture-centered produce farm deep in the pristine old-growth coniferous wilderness of the Sandy River Gorge and the Bull Run Wilderness near Portland, Oregon. Stargazer Farms, established as the Oregon Bulb Farm in the 1930s sits on a river bluff and is filled with a variety of unsprayed and organic plant life, including heirloom flowers left over from its previous life as a flower farm. It is alive with bees, butterflies and other natural pollinators, all of which forage blooms from early spring to late fall. One cannot sit still on our property during foraging season without seeing a pollinator feeding on nectar, or without hearing a constant hum-buzz of life. Three honeybee hives are kept here by our farmers at this time. I would like to add to those hives, using time-honored holistic beekeeping methods, as well as research new ways to attract and provide homes for wild pollinators like bumblebees and orchard bees. With success, I hope eventually to produce and provide these homes and habitat plans for other farms, backyard gardens and urban environments in my bioregion and beyond. Another aim is outreach, education and establishment as a nonprofit with the aim of employing at a living wage disabled people to work the hives, package honey, and help produce wild bee homes and habitats. </p><p><b>The ultimate aim of Lusted Road Honey Co. &amp; Humblebee Pollinator Conservatory is to fill the world with honeybees, wild pollinators, and wildflowers. </b></p><p><span><b></b></span></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/364313/files/20140211155328-bees_will_live_.jpg?1392162808"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p><b><br/></b><span><br/></span>It is often said that the best sign of a healthy farm is a healthy beehive. Could the same be said of the world? If so, we are headed for some trouble. Bees are disappearing. Since 2006, beekeepers throughout North American and parts of Europe have watched helplessly as their honeybee hives are decimated by <a href=""http://www.ars.usda.gov/news/docs.htm?docid=15572"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">colony collapse disorder.</a> From backyard hobbyists to major commercial operators, keepers have reported up to 90% hive losses each year since then, with an average yearly hive loss of 34% since 2006, since the disorder was first named and diagnosed. While hives can fall to many ailments, the mark of CCD is a hive from which nearly all the bees in the colony disappear, leaving behind the queen bee, her brood and a handful of sick bees. As bees cannot live without their colony, all the bees die. With the exception of the bees left behind in the hive, none of the other bees are found. They simply disappear. <span><br/></span><span><span><br/></span>There are many theories but no real answers as to the cause of CCD, but some thoughts and research point to systemic pesticides, monoculture farming practices, soil erosion, changing weather patterns in North America, chemical treatment of beehives, pollution, water scarcity, viruses including a newly discovered one that jumps from flower to bee, premature replacement of queen bees to increase honey production, varroa mites (not all CCD cases show the presence of these mites, however) and management stressors such as some migratory beekeeping practices. <br/></span><span><span></span></span><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/></span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">It's not just honeybees that are in danger.

Feral honeybees are colonies that have swarmed, or left with their queen in order to make room in the hive for a new queen and colony. Feral honeybee colonies were a common sight in the wild for some time, but their numbers, along with native wild bees, butterflies and bats are diminishing rapidly as well. In </span><a href=""https://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/5193"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""line-height: 1.45em;"" target=""_blank"">China</a><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">, there are areas where there are no bees left at all, and entire orchards are pollinated by hand. <span><br/></span></span><span><br/></span>At Lusted Road Honey Co. &amp; Humblebee Pollinator Conservatory, we will put into practice time-honored beekeeping methods with an eye on current scientific research. We will utilize native wildflower seed mixtures  to provide our bees, both kept and feral, with a wide variety of food beyond what they will find in our fields and forests. We will keep meticulous records and provide up-to-date information on our website, to be built with funding from this campaign. We will provide classes, hands-on community outreach and work with existing conservation societies to promote best practices for pollinator conservation. We will also harvest and sell our honey. All proceeds will go toward our establishment as a nonprofit, and toward the goals previously listed. We will also  breed queens, and intend to learn how capture unwanted swarms and adopt unwanted existing hives in our area, and to encourage beekeepers in other regions to do the same. </p><p>                <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/363012/files/20140211071207-beehives-vintage-image-Graphics-Fairy-sm.jpg?1392131527"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><ul>
<li>
<b>Our aim with this fundraiser is to raise $7000 to begin our effort.</b> Your donations will cover our minimum start-up costs. We will buy brand new hives and equipment from local companies. This is important as this is a bioregional effort, and we want to support our local economy. We will visit Ruhl Bee Supply as well as Bee Thinking. We will do our best to buy locally bred bee packages and nucs to populate our hives. We will hire local experts to consult us if we run into problems. We will continue our research and education into the practice of beekeeping. We will join existing pollinator conservation efforts and beekeeping societies, establish an official website to share news and best practices for caring for bees and pollinators as well as to sell products from the hive, and we will buy electric fencing to keep predators safely away from our beehives. (We live in a forest where bears and other honey-lovers live.) We will purchase materials needed to build a better bumblebee home and to build and utilize orchard bee houses. Finally, we will be able to afford to apply for grants to further fund our effort, and establish a nonprofit so that your future donations will be tax-deductible. Currently we are in the process of establishing ourselves as an Oregon business and have filed a DBA to that effect. </li>
<li>
<b>Each donation you make will come with a perk. </b>From $5 and under (your name on our website) on up to $1000 (stay with us at the farm for a weekend, receive many one-of-a-kind gifts, and we will name the first queen bee after you) perks include poems, artwork, a salon &amp; cocktail reception in the historic farmhouse here at Stargazer Farms, a guided hike through the gorge and down to a black sand beach below the property, a children's day out at the farm, the chance to see your manuscript put to print and designed by a respected independent press, access to exclusive updates from Dena, a bound first year beekeeping journal, an exclusive chapbook of Dena's bee poems, one of a kind works of art and books, and a cooking lesson and dinner for four at Stargazer farm with world-renowned chef Isabel Cruz, plus of course, first-harvest honey &amp; other products from the hive. </li>
<li>
<b>Whether we make our goal or not</b>, we plan to put your donations to use by establishing beehives here on the farm, and to begin researching new ways to attract and host wild pollinators. The more money we raise, the more bees we can help. We will reinvest the money we make from this venture into helping more bees, and will consult with organic food company executives and farm owners as well as others to make sure we grow a financially sustainable organization. </li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact &amp; Possible Risks </h3><ul>
<li>Bees and other pollinators are important not only to human survival and our food chain, but to the ecology of forests, deserts and everything in between. Where plants grow, pollinators are present. Most of us know that bees are in danger. This is a chance to help do something about it. </li>
<li>I am an active member of my literary community. I donate time and energy, as well as money, to its well-being. My work is widely published, I live and work on a farm in the wilderness and am supported by those who also live on my family farm, which is dedicated to sustainable agriculture. I work and have valuable contacts in the organic food industry, and have worked for political leaders in all sorts of advocacy, including disability rights. My heart is set on helping my world community save the bees, and I have a track record of dedication to the causes I believe in. I live on a sustainable farm and my bees will help it thrive, as it will help my bees thrive. </li>
<li>Risks are obvious. Sadly, first year and even established beehives stand a good chance of dying. So many things can and are going wrong right now. That's the reason I am taking action. While the bees I raise have a good chance of never encountering pesticides, there is the chance that it could happen as they forage. They have a lot of pristine foraging ground here, but there is no way to keep them from finding a sprayed flower. I will alert my neighbors, far off as they live from me (one mile is about the closest,) of my project and ask them to only spray at night if they must spray at all. It is common for a first year hive to produce only enough honey to sustain a colony over winter. Your honey sample perks might take more than one year to produce. The health of the bees will come first. </li>

Another aim is outreach, education and establishment as a nonprofit with the aim of employing at a living wage disabled people to work the hives, package honey, and help produce wild bee homes and habitats. The ultimate aim of Lusted Road Honey Co. & Humblebee Pollinator Conservatory is to fill the world with honeybees, wild pollinators, and wildflowers. It is often said that the best sign of a healthy farm is a healthy beehive. Could the same be said of the world? If so, we are headed for some trouble. Bees are disappearing. Since 2006, beekeepers throughout North American and parts of Europe have watched helplessly as their honeybee hives are decimated by colony collapse disorder. From backyard hobbyists to major commercial operators, keepers have reported up to 90% hive losses each year since then, with an average yearly hive loss of 34% since 2006, since the disorder was first named and diagnosed. While hives can fall to many ailments, the mark of CCD is a hive from which nearly all the bees in the colony disappear, leaving behind the queen bee, her brood and a handful of sick bees. As bees cannot live without their colony, all the bees die. With the exception of the bees left behind in the hive, none of the other bees are found. They simply disappear. There are many theories but no real answers as to the cause of CCD, but some thoughts and research point to systemic pesticides, monoculture farming practices, soil erosion, changing weather patterns in North America, chemical treatment of beehives, pollution, water scarcity, viruses including a newly discovered one that jumps from flower to bee, premature replacement of queen bees to increase honey production, varroa mites (not all CCD cases show the presence of these mites, however) and management stressors such as some migratory beekeeping practices. It's not just honeybees that are in danger. Wild pollinators are seeing rapid declines as well. Feral honeybees are colonies that have swarmed, or left with their queen in order to make room in the hive for a new queen and colony. Feral honeybee colonies were a common sight in the wild for some time, but their numbers, along with native wild bees, butterflies and bats are diminishing rapidly as well. In China, there are areas where there are no bees left at all, and entire orchards are pollinated by hand. At Lusted Road Honey Co. & Humblebee Pollinator Conservatory, we will put into practice time-honored beekeeping methods with an eye on current scientific research. We will utilize native wildflower seed mixtures  to provide our bees, both kept and feral, with a wide variety of food beyond what they will find in our fields and forests. We will keep meticulous records and provide up-to-date information on our website, to be built with funding from this campaign. We will provide classes, hands-on community outreach and work with existing conservation societies to promote best practices for pollinator conservation. We will also harvest and sell our honey. All proceeds will go toward our establishment as a nonprofit, and toward the goals previously listed. We will also  breed queens, and intend to learn how capture unwanted swarms and adopt unwanted existing hives in our area, and to encourage beekeepers in other regions to do the same.                 What We Need & What You Get

Our aim with this fundraiser is to raise $7000 to begin our effort. Your donations will cover our minimum start-up costs. We will buy brand new hives and equipment from local companies. This is important as this is a bioregional effort, and we want to support our local economy. We will visit Ruhl Bee Supply as well as Bee Thinking. We will do our best to buy locally bred bee packages and nucs to populate our hives. We will hire local experts to consult us if we run into problems. We will continue our research and education into the practice of beekeeping. We will join existing pollinator conservation efforts and beekeeping societies, establish an official website to share news and best practices for caring for bees and pollinators as well as to sell products from the hive, and we will buy electric fencing to keep predators safely away from our beehives. (We live in a forest where bears and other honey-lovers live.) We will purchase materials needed to build a better bumblebee home and to build and utilize orchard bee houses. Finally, we will be able to afford to apply for grants to further fund our effort, and establish a nonprofit so that your future donations will be tax-deductible. Currently we are in the process of establishing ourselves as an Oregon business and have filed a DBA to that effect. 

Each donation you make will come with a perk. From $5 and under (your name on our website) on up to $1000 (stay with us at the farm for a weekend, receive many one-of-a-kind gifts, and we will name the first queen bee after you) perks include poems, artwork, a salon & cocktail reception in the historic farmhouse here at Stargazer Farms, a guided hike through the gorge and down to a black sand beach below the property, a children's day out at the farm, the chance to see your manuscript put to print and designed by a respected independent press, access to exclusive updates from Dena, a bound first year beekeeping journal, an exclusive chapbook of Dena's bee poems, one of a kind works of art and books, and a cooking lesson and dinner for four at Stargazer farm with world-renowned chef Isabel Cruz, plus of course, first-harvest honey & other products from the hive. 

Whether we make our goal or not, we plan to put your donations to use by establishing beehives here on the farm, and to begin researching new ways to attract and host wild pollinators. The more money we raise, the more bees we can help. We will reinvest the money we make from this venture into helping more bees, and will consult with organic food company executives and farm owners as well as others to make sure we grow a financially sustainable organization. 
The Impact & Possible Risks 
Bees and other pollinators are important not only to human survival and our food chain, but to the ecology of forests, deserts and everything in between. Where plants grow, pollinators are present. Most of us know that bees are in danger. This is a chance to help do something about it. 
I am an active member of my literary community. I donate time and energy, as well as money, to its well-being. My work is widely published, I live and work on a farm in the wilderness and am supported by those who also live on my family farm, which is dedicated to sustainable agriculture. I work and have valuable contacts in the organic food industry, and have worked for political leaders in all sorts of advocacy, including disability rights. My heart is set on helping my world community save the bees, and I have a track record of dedication to the causes I believe in. I live on a sustainable farm and my bees will help it thrive, as it will help my bees thrive. 
Risks are obvious. Sadly, first year and even established beehives stand a good chance of dying. So many things can and are going wrong right now. That's the reason I am taking action. While the bees I raise have a good chance of never encountering pesticides, there is the chance that it could happen as they forage. They have a lot of pristine foraging ground here, but there is no way to keep them from finding a sprayed flower. I will alert my neighbors, far off as they live from me (one mile is about the closest,) of my project and ask them to only spray at night if they must spray at all. It is common for a first year hive to produce only enough honey to sustain a colony over winter. Your honey sample perks might take more than one year to produce. The health of the bees will come first.

<p>Time slows down for no man, and the time for action is upon us right now.

<p>What does it tell you when you consider that things we see as very basic, abundant supplies--like bars of soap, blankets, toiletries, clothing, school supplies, moquito netting, first aid kits--are longed for and will make huge impacts in the lives of people faced with extreme poverty?  These are just a few of the essentials from the aid packs we're delivering.</p>
<p>Along with aid packs, we want to have at least 10 midwifery kits in this mission's inventory.  Building a midwifery base in rural areas guarantees a significant drop in both maternal and infant mortality rates, especially the regions we're visiting in Nicaragua which are regularly ravaged by hurricanes and lack a strong medical infrastructure.</p>
<p>We all know that there's so much more to humanitarian work than dropping off a boatload of supplies, no matter how much they're needed.  Making a real impact requires local involvement and collaborative efforts with community leaders, thought-out approaches to creating sustainability in the face of hardship, and long-term dedication to the cause.  At Green Seas, we want to create long-term social change through that kind of involvement. </p>

<li>Our deliveries are focusing on the East Coast of Nicaragua, mostly between the cities of Bluefields and Puerto Cabezas.  Known as both the ""Forgotten Coast"" in reference to treatment from the Nicaraguan government and the ""Mosquito Shore"" due to it's ecology, it encompasses the poorest areas of the country.</li>
<li>We're delivering midwifery kits, aid packages (which include a wide range of basic suppplies, mostly for personal hygiene, comfort and human dignity), first aid kits and school supplies. </li>
<li>Volunteers from Green Seas will be spending time in Nicaragua to work with community leaders, especially in the rural areas we visit, to help develop sustainability projects and break the chains of poverty.</li>
<li>It will take several weeks at sea to deliver the aid supplies from where the boat is docked in Califorina to Nicaragua. The planned route stretches over 3,000 miles, two oceans, connects two continents, and passes through Panama Canal before making landfall in the Caribbean.</li>

Eogea Inc. is a nonprofit organization that provides funding to small businesses and individuals developing new green technology and emerging sustainable industries. 

Eogea supports these green causes through grants provided from a proprietary endowment fund called the World Sustainability Fund (WSF). 



Eogea gives back to its donors by generating extensive publicity for them as green advocates and by offering them exclusive connections through the Eogea network. Read below for more details about what we do!





Our Story and Why Eogea was Founded.


We are consuming and depleting the world’s non-renewable resources; the problem is obvious. Without developing new technology to sustain the world’s limited resources, our future generations will never enjoy the lifestyle in which we currently live.Eogea’s core mission is to sustain our Earth’s precious, non-renewable resources and to encourage people worldwide to be more environmentally aware and active. To do this, we have created an endowment fund called The Worldwide Sustainability Fund (WSF). The WSF will provide financial backing to small businesses with the intention to research and develop innovative green applications or implement sustainable practices. The WSF awards penalty-free grant funding to applicants with promising projects aimed to develop technologies or practices to sustain the world’s limited resources.Funding for the WSF will be provided by people and businesses worldwide. By way of saying ‘thanks’ for the donation given, Eogea will publicly advertise the donor's support of creating a brighter, more eco-friendly future. Contributors will also gain access to a growing community of individuals and businesses that all say “I stand for a greener planet.” Donors will be able to promote eco-friendly practices while simultaneously connecting themselves to other green-conscious people and businesses. A healthy attitude and healthy world go hand in hand, and we hope that you’ll be involved in giving us the jump start Eogea needs. With Eogea, you will personally be part of the solution to help sustain the planet’s natural resources.But we don’t want to just stop there. We will be educating the public of ways to become more sustainable in their daily lives. This information will range from simple tips to large scale projects. In addition to these educational projects, Eogea will eventually provide a platform for innovative people to develop creative solutions for some of the world’s most ecologically pressing questions.  
We Believe...
Sustainability gives back. Green technology and sustainable practices preserve healthy ecosystems and environments, which provide vital resources such as clean water and clean air.  
You are investing in the Earth. You will be funding the companies that seek to improve the world for the benefit of us all.
Great ideas must be pursued. Everyone has great ideas, and some of these ideas could change the world. We cannot let an idea go to waste and become forgotten because the innovators did not have the funds to pursue it.

<p>
                    The idea of ""Going Green"" can be overwhelming. Where do you start? Where do you
                    make changes? What does it involve? How much time and effort will this take? What
                    will it cost?</p>
<p>
                    ""Going Green"" isn't just about championing an environmental cause. It's about improving
                    your own life one day at a time. It starts at home. It starts with you. It starts
                    by learning about healthier alternatives as well as making informed choices for
                    you and your family, not just for the greater good but for your own improved health
                    and well being.</p>
<p>Living a healthy, green life has been a passion of mine for over two decades. My own personal health was 
		compromised several years ago, putting my life and my family's well being at risk.
        As is often the case, the immediate focus was centered on managing the situation rather than discovering and 
        eliminating the underlying cause.</p>
<p>What really caused it? What could have been done to prevent 
it?  With time and effort, help from some enlightened individuals 
		along with a lot of research, I did recover.  But questions still 
lingered.  As environmental factors were at the root of it I 
		began to ask what can I do to keep healthy and avoid a repeat?  What 
could I do to protect my family in the future?  How can I 
		help others to do the same?</p>
<p>I started my ""Going Green"" project because I want to share with all of you, everything I have learned and 
        all the knowledge I continue to collect so that together, we can make improvements to the quality of our lives 
        at home, at work and at play.</p>
<p>By offering private consultations, group workshops and corporate ""Lunch &amp; Learn"" presentations, I look forward 
        to sharing resources for information and the steps you can easily take to improve your own health and environment, 
        for a better life.</p>
<p>I started this Indiegogo campaign because I would like to promote ""Going Green"" with a Zero-Emission 100% electric vehicle, as my dream is to move away from my dependence on fossil fuel.  </p>
<p>I have been a stay-at-home mother of two for twelve years now and do not have the funding to purchase an EV (electric vehicle).  I started my small business three years ago and would like to help it grow by promoting it on the EV, so that everywhere I go, people will have the opportunity to see what my business is all about, and that I am indeed ""green"" with my mode of transportation!</p>
<p>I would like to inspire others to do the same!  Our planet is in crisis and she needs all the help we can give...<br/></p>
<p>I would appreciate anything that you can contribute to help make our world a greener place!  Thank you...<br/></p>

		began to ask what can I do to keep healthy and avoid a repeat?  What 
could I do to protect my family in the future?  How can I 
		help others to do the same?
I started my ""Going Green"" project because I want to share with all of you, everything I have learned and 
        all the knowledge I continue to collect so that together, we can make improvements to the quality of our lives 
        at home, at work and at play.
By offering private consultations, group workshops and corporate ""Lunch & Learn"" presentations, I look forward 
        to sharing resources for information and the steps you can easily take to improve your own health and environment, 
        for a better life.
I started this Indiegogo campaign because I would like to promote ""Going Green"" with a Zero-Emission 100% electric vehicle, as my dream is to move away from my dependence on fossil fuel.  
I have been a stay-at-home mother of two for twelve years now and do not have the funding to purchase an EV (electric vehicle).  I started my small business three years ago and would like to help it grow by promoting it on the EV, so that everywhere I go, people will have the opportunity to see what my business is all about, and that I am indeed ""green"" with my mode of transportation!
I would like to inspire others to do the same!  Our planet is in crisis and she needs all the help we can give...
I would appreciate anything that you can contribute to help make our world a greener place!  Thank you...",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

</p><p>Australia’s Great Barrier Reef is at the centre
of global attention and concern due to evidence of declining health of the reef
and its ecosystems. Current plans call for expansion and development of ports
and industrial facilities within the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area and
surrounding it, adding to the concerns related to impacts from natural causes.
At Australian Oceanographics we have prepared a major scientific research
program to be at sea year round collecting critical data to help preserve,
protect and better manage these outstanding natural habitats. We are proud to
be seeking your help to achieve this goal and hope to make it a global mission
to better understand and preserve our oceans.</p>
To launch this mission, we recently completed a
full refit of two deep-sea manned submersibles in USA, for use in our scientific
programs within the Great Barrier Reef and around Australia. Manned research
submersibles have never before been based in Australia for dedicated research
of the nation's vast ocean environments and their natural assets. Funding for this
project will be used to immediately bring the submersibles to Australia and to begin
collecting critical baseline data in the areas where marine ecosystems are most
likely to be impacted before major developments take place. Our team has
assembled the scientific equipment platforms, secured a dedicated research
vessel and is ready to begin a series of major research programs aiming to fill
information gaps and uncover the unknowns of our oceans. Now all we need is
your generous support to fund this major project and help us create a promising
future for our oceans.<div><br/></div><div>While our Funding Goal is a significant target that we'd love to achieve and reaching it would allow us to run our C-SEA campaign with ongoing time at sea, we will be able to utilise all contributions whether or not the target is reached.</div><div>

<h3>Who We Are &amp; What We Do</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Our company, Australian Oceanographics,
strives to develop and provide cutting edge marine and oceanographic research
tools and equipment to scientists in Australia. 
The scientific expertise already exists in
Australia, however there is commonly not enough funding for these researchers
to acquire or lease the necessary scientific tools to carry out world-class
investigations and experiments in Australia's true last frontier, its oceans.</p>
<p>We are addressing this critical gap in
scientific capability by providing researchers with free access to the underwater equipment
that they cannot afford or acquire. Our primary objective is to bring
scientifically capable manned submersibles to Australia to expand oceanographic
and marine research capabilities, and to enable scientists to carry out
world-class investigations. Along with dedicated manned submersibles we are
compiling a range of various innovative and hi-tech equipment to perform groundbreaking
studies in Australia’s vast oceans. Scientists are also encouraged to come to
us when they identify fundamental research topics but there is no current technology
to sufficiently carry out those studies. In this case, we work with the
researchers to develop new innovative equipment to help them succeed in their
goals. Whatever the needs of the scientists, we pride ourselves in making the
technologies freely available to their studies and contributing towards our own
research programs.</p>
<p>Our company was established in 2006,
founded by two trained scientists that recognized this substantial gap in
Australian marine and oceanographic research capabilities. We are based in
southeast Queensland, for it's ideal location along the east coast of Australia
allowing easy access to the Great Barrier Reef and its associated natural
resources, as well as being close to the high density city areas.</p>
<p>We have already secured two DeepWorker 2000
manned submersibles with our crew successfully completing a full refit of both
subs to enhance their operational and scientific capability. We have also served
as the primary Industry Partner for the “Deep Australia” ARC (Australian
Research Council) grant in collaboration with The University of Queensland (UQ),
and other leading institutes around the world. The Deep Australia project
successfully developed and operated innovative “Research Camera Lander” systems
and other innovative equipment. Continuing on from the successes of this grant,
we have agreed with UQ to continue working on the Deep Australia project even
though government funding for the project has now finished. Collaborations like
this with UQ and other institutes will continue and are critical for processing
and publishing the data and results that will arise from our efforts in years
to come.</p>
Australian Oceanographics now needs your help to
kick off a major oceanographic research and monitoring project!<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>With Australia’s population growing and our
major city centres expanding along the coastlines, marine ecosystems are under
a continual pressure to cope with the impacts of development, resource
exploitation, recreation and natural catastrophes. Australian Oceanographics
has prepared a long-term ecosystem monitoring and investigation program
utilizing our innovative scientific platforms and technologies to compile
comprehensive baseline data along Australia’s eastern coast. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Under recent review by
UNESCO (for more information, visit: <a href=""http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/154"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/154</a> ) the Australian Government has submitted a report in
January 2014 on the current state of the Great Barrier Reef’s conservation and management.
 This report describes the current
conditions and knowledge gaps of the GBR, demonstrates the management steps
already in place and outlines the future objectives and targets for the GBR conservation
as the World’s primary custodian of the Reef. A full copy of the report is publicly
available (<a href=""http://www.environment.gov.au/resource/state-party-report-state-conservation-great-barrier-reef-world-heritage-area-australia-2014"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.environment.gov.au/resource/state-party-report-state-conservation-great-barrier-reef-world-heritage-area-australia-2014</a>
). Australian Oceanographics has actively participated in the many public
comment phases related to the preparation of this report and others. Our
approach is independent of the Australian Government and associated groups, but
our efforts are collaborative and we always strive to support and contribute to
the work of Governmental agencies, Universities and other not for profit
organizations.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The C-SEA (Continental-Shelf of Eastern
Australia) program is the flagship project for Australian Oceanographics and
makes up a long-term scientific plan to explore, map and study the marine
ecosystems of our ‘backyard’. Examining the coastal and offshore waters of the
continental shelf from Cape York, Queensland, to as far south as Sydney, New
South Wales, the project aims to provide critical unbiased baseline
environmental data to increase our knowledge and understanding of the marine
ecosystems found off our coasts, including a focus on the Great Barrier Reef. The  rapidly increasing populations along
eastern Australia’s coastline along with our reliance on the oceans for
recreation and economic gain are putting immense pressures on these ecosystems
that we know little about. We will work in partnership with Australian
scientists and international collaborators to focus on current knowledge gaps
and collect critical baseline data to better inform management and
decision-makers, and to increase awareness for all those who are affected by
changes in Australia’s oceans.</p>
<p>The primary research goals of the C-SEA
program are to:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Collect critical baseline
environmental data, which includes documentation of habitat types and
ecosystems, organism biodiversity, species identification and abundance, as
well as monitoring water quality.</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Survey the sea floor along eastern
Australia’s continental shelf using high-resolution equipment to increase
detailed topographic/bathymetric data.</span></li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">
Prepare detailed maps to provide a better
understanding of what seafloor structures and ecosystems are present in
our deep-sea and ocean environments. Seafloor mapping also allows for much
more efficient and precise operations of underwater vehicles in relatively
unknown or previously uncharted environments.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Survey unexplored areas and
identify the organisms and ecosystems found within them as well as locate and
highlight any historical or culturally significant artefacts.</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>






Performing these fundamental investigations and
focusing on areas of natural or scientific significance, proposed industrial
and urban developments, high resource potential and regions under threat by
natural or human-induced impacts, will enable all of us to better understand
the state of our oceans and how to manage their conservation appropriately and
sustainably. Our commitment to be at sea year-round performing recurring studies of the same areas and
environments at appropriate intervals over time, will allow researchers to
broaden their understanding of the natural cycles of environments and how
habitats and organisms react to various impacts.<br/><p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This Indiegogo project is targeted
to raise AUD $1,500,000 to enable us to mobilise the submersibles and other
research platforms and to begin operation of the C-SEA project with missions at
sea. We have funded our efforts to date with substantial amounts of our own
money to acquire the necessary equipment, put together a team of experienced
personnel and support real, credible ocean science. We are now seeking your
support to begin the collection of vital unbiased data where it’s most needed. Our
goal is to commence ongoing year-round scientific operations around the areas of proposed port expansions
and developments that are currently under significant public and media
pressure, as well as within areas of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area
that are of concern under the investigation by the UNESCO World Heritage
Committee and the International Union for Conservation of Nature. We will be inviting world-renowned scientists as
well as post-graduates and students to come onboard for our expeditions in
which they will gain free access to our capabilities and equipment in order to
achieve our joint research goals.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>How You Can Help</h3>

<p>Our Project is a substantial undertaking and requires the same scale of funding, but every donation, no matter how big or small, is extremely helpful to us! We appreciate and rely on those of you who can only contribute in our small categories just as much as those who can afford more. Every dollar you are able to donate will get us more time on the water, and in turn give our oceans a better chance at a having a healthy future!</p>
<p>Your generous contributions will help us to
mobilize the submersibles and get started immediately so that baseline sampling
can begin before activities of potential impact to these environments commence. In return for your kind donations we are offering some very unique ""Perks"" that will actively involve and keep our contributors up to date with our project and its operations.

<h3>Inquinamen(t)o Project</h3>
<p>The “Inquinamen(t)o” Project aims at increasing the awareness of people in Italy about the current state of water pollution in the region of Veneto (North Italy). The water pollution in object is due to the leakage of PFAS (polluting agent) in the groundwater.<br/>In 2013 ARPAV (Veneto regional environmental prevention and protection agency) and the Italian national health system started to investigate the case and its possible consequences on food and population. An important public health screening programme, both on human health and food, is currently underway. Our project will facilitate the access on those results once the screening activities, carried out by public health services, will be completed.<br/>The project consists of an awareness campaign based on the production and promotion of a short motion graphic video. The short cartoon will be posted on the social media and screened during relevant events. The video will increase the awareness about water pollution, providing easy access to related materials and spreading information and facts that are scientific and legally proven.</p>

The water pollution in object is due to the leakage of PFAS (polluting agent) in the groundwater.In 2013 ARPAV (Veneto regional environmental prevention and protection agency) and the Italian national health system started to investigate the case and its possible consequences on food and population. An important public health screening programme, both on human health and food, is currently underway. Our project will facilitate the access on those results once the screening activities, carried out by public health services, will be completed.The project consists of an awareness campaign based on the production and promotion of a short motion graphic video. The short cartoon will be posted on the social media and screened during relevant events. The video will increase the awareness about water pollution, providing easy access to related materials and spreading information and facts that are scientific and legally proven.
 

What We Need & What You Get
The contribution is intended to finance the production of a video in motion graphics. The video will be design and created by professional supplier. 
The Campaign Goal Amount reported in the platform is to half the total cost of the video. This sum will allow us to start the production of the video. To finance the whole video we will use additional forms of fundraising.Based on the paid amount, you will get a our  personal gratitude and certain level of visibility within the video.
 
The impact

Number of municipalities involved: 21
Number of citizens involved: 126.927
Number of citizens who take advantage of the aqueduct: 109.029
Range of age for citizens eligible for the health screening: 14 yo – 65 yo
Number of citizens eligible for the screening: 84.795
Expected participation to the screening campaign: 59.356 (70%)
Successful track record: the initiative moves from a previous experience of video production (aimed at increasing the participation of the voters) that reached over 150,000 people",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

SDN's  mission is to support the efforts of those affected by extractive industries and weak governance through rights based community empowerment. 

What does SDN do in the Niger Delta


 
""The Niger Delta is a region suffering from administrative neglect, crumbling social infrastructure and services, high unemployment, social deprivation, abject poverty, filth and squalor, and endemic conflict.""


The Niger Delta fuels Nigeria's heavily oil-dependent economy and accounts for 95% of Nigeria's export earnings and over 80% of Federal Government revenue. However, this region remains one of the poorest parts of the country. 

The extreme neglect of Human Rights and Governance from all levels of Government is endemic throughout the region. 

Billions of dollars from oil revenues have been distributed unequally and have not translated into development and basic services for the population. 

The majority of the Niger Delta inhabitants lack access to basic infrastructure, health and education services as well as job opportunities. High levels of pollution and destruction of traditional means of livelihood increase the vulnerability to poverty in the region. The fundamental conditions of extreme deprivation have remained unchanged for decades and drive cycles of violent conflict.



SDN's two organisational pillars of research and advocacy, supported by two core tools of capacity building and pilot projects help facilitate communities and civil society to communicate a shared vision and negotiate with other stakeholders, to get a better deal from the investments and operations that affect their lives, livelihoods and environment.
SDN believes that empowered communities can become the agents of change and uphold their basic socio-political and economic rights. 


SDN helps communities to become knowledgeable, confident, inclusive, organized and able to participate in and influence decision- making to improve their lives.

   The Impact
 
Poor operating practices, weak law enforcement and an active illegal oil economy contribute to hundreds of oil spills a year in the Niger Delta.

This environmental disaster destroys traditional livelihoods, breeds mistrust and resentment and undermines the operational security of oil companies and Federal Government.

SDN recognises the importance of building the capacity of citizens and civil society in all areas of their work. 
£10 donations can contribute to funding communities based training in rural areas of Rivers, Delta and Bayelsa State in response to this national emergency. 

Larger donations can support community groups to identify a multi-stakeholder process that streamlines regulations, reduces incentives for the illegal oil economy and ensures global standards are enforced.

A pesar de que hay una gran belleza natural en esta región, muchos recursos, y gente muy creativa, muchas de estas personas sienten que no tienen oportunidades.</p>

<h2><strong>Help us create development and employment alternatives in Los Santos community in Costa Rica</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Cultura Verde Project</strong></h3>
<p>Hello! We are Cultura Verde, an <strong>initiative led by three professional women</strong> who have united our knowledge on organic agriculture, art, culture and gastronomy to create this ambitious project.</p>
<p>Our <strong>main operations center</strong> is located at El Casquillo, an organic farm located in the coffee farming mountains of Los Santos in Costa Rica.  <a href=""http://elcasquillo.wix.com/culturaverde"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://elcasquillo.wix.com/culturaverde</a></p>
<p>We work with local community groups helping them to carry out development projects which will <strong>generate new employment options</strong> in the area. We <strong>focus on 3 topics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>organic agriculture (biointensive)</li>
<li>arts (including art-therapy)</li>
<li>
<p>culture (linked to tourism)</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What do we need your collaboration for?</span></strong></p>
<p>We need to raise a minimum of <strong>$25.000 USD</strong> to improve and enlarge our infrastructure in order to be able to hold cultural events, workshops, trainings and host more people.</p>
<p>The money will be used in:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Condition and equip the kitchen and dining room</strong> area (work tables, furniture, cabinets, stove, refrigerator, tables and chairs, cooking utensils, dishes and silverware, etc.) - <strong>$3.800</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Close the ranch with windows and install a floor</strong> in it (we would add some 50 m2 of comfortable space to be at during nights and cooler days) -<strong>$6.500</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Build a deck</strong> to host the public events (we would add some additional space of 30 m2)<strong>- $7.000</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Build a storage room</strong> for equipment, furniture and food ingredients– <strong>$7.000</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Buy audiovisual equipment, tools and materials </strong>for our workshops and trainings - <strong>$3.000</strong>
</li>
</ul><p>We really need to improve the current conditions at our center to be able to offer a better service, as well as an awesome learning and enjoyment experience for all.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The impact on the community</span></strong></p>
<p>The Los Santos region produces some of the world’s best coffee. This coffee production and the coffee cooperatives have brought prosperity to many, but there are people, especially young people and women's groups, who are being left behind. In spite of the region’s great natural beauty, many resources, and very creative people, they don’t feel that there are opportunities for them.</p>
<p>Working with these groups in communities, we believe that we can help them see and take advantage of new opportunities, creating a multiplier effect, not only economically but also in these communities’ vision for their future.</p>

<p>We have at least three sources for assuring financial support:</p>

Realmente necesitamos contar con mejores condiciones para poder ofrecer un servicio excelente y una experiencia de disfrute y aprendizaje óptima.
El impacto sobre la comunidad
En esta zona se produce uno de los mejores cafés del mundo. Esta actividad y las cooperativas cafetaleras han traído prosperidad para muchos pero, también hay personas, sobre todo jóvenes y grupos de mujeres, que están quedando excluidos. A pesar de que hay una gran belleza natural en esta región, muchos recursos, y gente muy creativa, muchas de estas personas sienten que no tienen oportunidades.
Al ayudarles a ver y consolidar nuevas oportunidades de desarrollo, creemos que podemos crear un efecto multiplicador, no solo en lo económico sino también en la visión de futuro de cada una de estas comunidades.

Help us create development and employment alternatives in Los Santos community in Costa Rica
Cultura Verde Project
Hello! We are Cultura Verde, an initiative led by three professional women who have united our knowledge on organic agriculture, art, culture and gastronomy to create this ambitious project.
Our main operations center is located at El Casquillo, an organic farm located in the coffee farming mountains of Los Santos in Costa Rica.  http://elcasquillo.wix.com/culturaverde
We work with local community groups helping them to carry out development projects which will generate new employment options in the area. We focus on 3 topics:

organic agriculture (biointensive)
arts (including art-therapy)

culture (linked to tourism)

What do we need your collaboration for?
We need to raise a minimum of $25.000 USD to improve and enlarge our infrastructure in order to be able to hold cultural events, workshops, trainings and host more people.
The money will be used in:


Condition and equip the kitchen and dining room area (work tables, furniture, cabinets, stove, refrigerator, tables and chairs, cooking utensils, dishes and silverware, etc.) - $3.800


Close the ranch with windows and install a floor in it (we would add some 50 m2 of comfortable space to be at during nights and cooler days) -$6.500


Build a deck to host the public events (we would add some additional space of 30 m2)- $7.000


Build a storage room for equipment, furniture and food ingredients– $7.000


Buy audiovisual equipment, tools and materials for our workshops and trainings - $3.000

We really need to improve the current conditions at our center to be able to offer a better service, as well as an awesome learning and enjoyment experience for all.
The impact on the community
The Los Santos region produces some of the world’s best coffee. This coffee production and the coffee cooperatives have brought prosperity to many, but there are people, especially young people and women's groups, who are being left behind. In spite of the region’s great natural beauty, many resources, and very creative people, they don’t feel that there are opportunities for them.
Working with these groups in communities, we believe that we can help them see and take advantage of new opportunities, creating a multiplier effect, not only economically but also in these communities’ vision for their future.
For more information on this regard visit this section of our webpage: http://elcasquillo.wix.com/culturaverde#!alianzas/c1nt5
How will we achieve sustainability for this Project?
We have at least three sources for assuring financial support:

Public participation at our cultural and educational events
Support from the private industry through their corporate social responsibility programs
Government cultural and environmental support grants

Why then are climatologists speaking out about the dangers of global warming? The answer is that virtually all of us are now convinced that global warming poses a clear and present danger to civilization.             -- Lonnie Thompson, Ohio State paleoclimatologist, 2010Sometimes doing your best is not good enough. Sometimes you must do what is required.             -- Winston ChurchillThe Climate Mobilization is a growing group of people who know that climate change threatens the collapse of civilization within this century. We believe, along with many well-respected scientists and environmental analysts, that the only way to preserve a climate that is safe, stable, and supportive of human civilization is to fight climate change with a  World War II-scale mobilization.The Pledge to Mobilize - a political platform and social movement strategy - is a tool that can make this possible.  (View our slideshow for an  overview!)Signers publicly acknowledge climate change as a threat to civilization and call on the US Federal Government to instigate a WWII scale mobilization to fight back. Signers pledge their support to politicians who have also signed the Pledge, and, critically, promise to spread the Pledge to others-- their friends, family, and communities. In this way the Pledge is both a democracy re-boot and a viral strategy. The Pledge was designed to overcome psychological, cultural, and technological barriers to engagement in order to make the climate crisis real for people and bring about a cultural transformation.
Commence a five-year mobilization, on the scale of the WWII home front mobilization,  to preserve a climate that is safe, stable, and supportive of human civilization. 
Reduce national carbon emissions by at least 76% in 5 years, at a rate of no less than 25% per year.
Create a Climate Mobilization Corps, tens of millions strong, which will implement adaptation measures and rapidly expand our post-carbon energy infrastructure and agricultural systems.
Conduct this mobilization in accordance with the Constitution, and ensure that the essential needs of the civilian economy are met during this transition. 

Exert diplomatic and international pressure to enlist allied nations in this heroic fight against social, economic, and environmental chaos. 

**Full Pledge text available in the gallery**Perhaps this strikes you as a pie-in-the-sky platform. We fully acknowledge, given the current political climate of passivity, willful ignorance, denial and stalemate, that our demands are ""unrealistic"" in the narrow sense of the word.  That's why the Pledge to Mobilize is also a social movement strategy designed to leverage massive public support for a scientifically tenable mobilization platform.The Pledge's demands are not idle words. Signing the Pledge to Mobilize commits you to supporting political candidates, on the local, state, and national level, who have also signed the Pledge. This creates a challenge, and an opportunity, for sitting politicians and their opponents: Will they sign? Will they acknowledge that climate change threatens the collapse of civilization and muster the courage to fight back? As more people take the Pledge, it will become an ever more effective political tool. This is not another internet petition. You can't just ""take"" the Pledge online. It has to be given to you by someone who has already taken it. This ""person to person"" method of spreading encourages people to discuss climate change with their friends, family, and communities.  Signers spread the Pledge to people they respect and care about. Climate change is often avoided as a topic of conversation, in large part because it makes people feel scared and helpless. But the Pledge changes that equation. The Pledge provides a frame for discussions about climate change that are scary, but also realistically hopeful. We can fight this crisis and every one of us can contribute. The Pledge is a flexible strategy. 

Pledgers can host events at their homes, or
in the community. They can organize local lectures and discussions about
the climate crisis and the Climate Mobilization. Religious people can spread the Pledge in their
communities of worship, and climate educators can offer the Pledge after their presentations. The
Climate Mobilization can have booths at farmers’ markets, staffed by Pledge signers, who will offer
frank conversations about climate change, the need for a mobilization, and the Pledge as a tool to
get us there. 
Spreading the Pledge can transform our culture of denial into one of truth, courage, and active engagement.

Rather than finding a ""politically realistic"" solution that does not address the scientific realities and cannot prevent the collapse of civilization, our goal is to fundamentally alter what is realistic. Spreading
the Pledge can instigate millions of conversations about climate change,
fostering a culture of dedicated emergency response. The media will stop asking politicians, “Do you believe in climate change?” and start asking them, “Will you fight for civilization or not?”
