<h3>Short Summary</h3>
I am Nia Burks. I’m a video artist.  I investigate identity constructs, personal relationships, and collective memory on the web. I use appropriated videos that I find on YouTube to re-create and re-define their meaning and existence so that I can learn more about how we use the social web. <br/><br/> I appropriate footage because figuring out the web is a rapidly moving target and I believe the people who use it best define its purpose. My goal with art is to learn more about how we use the internet as a tool for connectivity, ask questions, and come to a few conclusions before the next set of questions come barreling in. <br/><br/> Right now, I am preparing to have a solo exhibition with a new body of work titled Standardized Authenticity. This new body of work will show in Berlin, Germany concurrent with the Berlin Biennale at Art Claims Impulse Gallery in Kreuxburg. An opening, artist talk and a live performance will take place on April 27<sup>th </sup>and the show will be up for the following month. <br/><br/> I am in a crucial developmental stage for the work. I need many many hours to put the finishing touches on this body of video work and I need backers to help fund this project and make this artist talk and performance happen.</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
My goal is to raise $1500 to help cover the total cost of production and travel. Your contributions will not go unrewarded. The perk system I’ve created is intended to not only thank you for your generosity, but also further this research by allowing me to directly collaborate and respond the medium I work in---you and me, the web users. For every donation over $50 there is a personalized perk. I did this, not only for obvious awesome perk related reasons, but also because my work deals with the personal that’s been mediated. I want to highlight that mediated connection while also trying to bring back the idea of a unique interaction between two people.<br/><br/> For $10, I will add your name to my website as a contributor. For $20, I will add your name to my website, and send you a handwritten postcard from Berlin when I arrive for the exhibition opening. For $50, you get all of the above, plus a 5x7 mini show poster signed with a unique Photobooth shot of the gallery and me before the opening. For $100, you get all of the above, a personalized thank you video postcard that Ill post to YouTube from the gallery and an 8x10 print of a unique computer glitch that I will screen shot while I am abroad so that you have a physical print of a specific and ephemeral moment in time. My computer makes these for me pretty often and I catch them and name them.  For $250, you’ll be invited to a pre- opening curatorial tour via BlogTv with me containing new work not yet on the web, and receive a personalized 11x14 print of one of my Facebook layered default prints created from YOUR facebook photos. For $500, you’ll get all of the above, plus a 30 second unique piece of video art that you create the prompt for. We will discuss the prompt and idea in a one on one meeting via skype upon my return from Berlin. This way, you and I, the web users, can directly collaborate on the subject of an artwork, which I have not yet done in my art practice yet.</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div>
<div>This show will help get my work out during a very important time of year: the Berlin Biennale. Having this exhibition and talk at Art Claims Impulse during the same time that the Berlin Biennale will give my work countless eyes and attention, and thus help contribute to an ever changing and shifting dialogue that is the internet.</div>
<div> </div>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>Don't have any money but still want to contribute? Thats ok. Share this link, pass along my website and tell folks about the show! Find the Standardized Authenticity Page on Facebook (look out, it'll be up soon!) and share it with friends.</p></div>","Short Summary

<p>Our goal is to revitalise an iconic and historically significant building in Glasgow, Scotland - by developing it into a vibrant venue, bringing art, music, culture and life to a disadvantaged area of the city.</p>
<h3>
<br/>Who we are and our campaign</h3>
<p>The Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society is an independent, non-profit making charity, established in 1973 to promote the awareness of the Scottish architect, artist and designer, Charles Rennie Mackintosh and support the preservation and protection of Mackintosh's buildings.</p>
<p>One of the many not-for-profit activities of the Society has been to rescue and restore his only Church, when it fell into disuse in 1976 and was no longer required by the Church of Scotland.  The building was in danger of being lost and the Society stepped in to save it.  With many renovations and a major restoration project the Society aims to protect and preserve this important building for future generations.</p>
<p>We recognise that the building, while having such historic relevance to the area through its iconic architect, is also a beautiful and unique building that can create the perfect setting for the arts.</p>
<p>Our campaign is designed to help us develop this stunning site and take advantage of the building's excellent natural acoustic qualities for the use of concerts, gigs, exhibitions and shows. This will not only help to keep the building alive, but also creates a new and vibrant arts centre in one of the areas of highest multiple deprivation in Glasgow.</p>
<h3>What we need</h3>
<p>To achieve our goal we need to raise £10,000 to put towards transforming this venue into a usable and accessible area for performing artists, musicians and events.</p>
<p>The money will be used in three key ways:</p>
<p>To create additional performance space.<br/>Install stage lighting, to help create the right atmosphere that will enhance any type of performance, exhibition or art show.<br/>To provide a quality grand piano that will give musicians access to use the venue as a performing space.<br/>***This will not only help open up the building for arts use, but also give free access to local music students to use the space for rehearsals and lunchtime concerts.***</p>
<p>If we did not reach our goal of £10,000, we would assess the most effective way to use what money we have raised to fulfill one or two of these aspects.</p>
<p>All of the work that we do within the building is in consultation with Historic Scotland and conservation specialists.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By contributing to this cause we will be able to create a facility that will enhance a heritage building and bring life to the area it is situated in, by encouraging a world of arts, music and culture to perform here. This will bring associated benefits to the local community, local artists and performers and encourages a sustainable use of this unique heritage site.</p>
<p>Moreover your efforts will help music students from the area to develop their talents for free.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand more than most, that often money can be limited and would not wish you to contribute if you are unable.</p>
<p>However, you could help us by spreading the word. You can shout it from the rooftops, proclaim it over the dinner table, announce it to a stranger, OR if you could share a link on your Facebook or twitter page then we would be very grateful.</p>
<p>Indiegogo also have some great share tools for spreading the word.</p>

<p>By the upmost straight forward meaning of its name ""Take the festival"", by all means, we want you to do just that! We are giving you ((anyone attending)) safe artistic freedom as artists to spread your wings.</p>
<p>You are encouraged to go all out, live your dream, be inspiring, be jaw dropping, And CREATE!</p>
<p>Plunderfest is much, much more then a music or art festival.... PlunderFest is an experience!</p>
<p>There are two types of people who attend our festival. The watcher, and the participant.  We can promise you, by the end of the weekend you're a participant.</p>
<p>While we are <strong>NOT</strong> a non-profit, all proceeds gained from the festival go back into its self to create a better experience for the following year.  If our proceeds ever reach a million dollars.... you better believe we are putting on one hell of a million dollar show the following year! </p>
<p>We have a pretty huge goal to do something for the Midwest that has never been done before.....   Let us explain how and why....</p>
<p>Usually a typical concert takes place in a gated venue.  If there is to be camping, it is usually in a separate housing area OUTSIDE of the gated music area. Not a very pleasant walk to get back and forth and it also becomes a hassle to get in and out of a secured zone for the patron.</p>
<p>Usually a typical concert has specified hours of am-pm and once the music stops... you are left to your own device, shuffled out of the music area as quickly as can be and gates are locked till the next concert day.  The in-between is left to your own mind. Not always entirely fun..</p>
<p>These are the first 2 things Plunderfest sought after as a foundation for change.<br/>We have one major zone.... Everything happens within ONE area. All festival activities take place inside ONE GIANT FESTIVAL GROUNDS. Leaves out all complication and the annoyance that goes with it. </p>
<p><strong>NOW...</strong> here is the foundation that makes PlunderFest what it is!<br/><br/><strong>PARTICIPATION AND CREATION!</strong> <br/><br/>Creating a piece that shows who and what you are... and allowing others to safely view your dream in a scope that holds no time limits nor boundaries outside of safety. </p>
<h2><strong>To the musical artists: </strong></h2>
<p>We offer the creative gift of our stages to you.  We offer you a chance to play our gorgeous stages in the deep Midwest woods to present the best of your talents. We do our best to provide you the exposure you so greatly deserve. Hard thought and countless hours of planning goes in to this process each year. Our goal here is to ensure magical experiences happen by day and into the evening in our concert area with musical appearances from artists through out the world. <br/><br/>Large consideration goes into the UP AND COMING LOCAL musicians of the Midwest. We wish for your everlasting success in fulfilling your dreams as an artist.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The real magic happens everywhere else....  Sculptures, art installations, theme camp built stages, fun houses, cool down areas, simple to amazingly complex structures that have full interaction with you! YOU are the artist, YOU are the patron, YOU are the festival... YOU are what we care about and YOU are the reason the magic exists!</p>
<p>Our musical gifts follow the guidelines of the law for keeping hours of timed sound.... HOWEVER once the music is over there is playground of un-measurable possibility only limited by the artist.  If you want to see it, we encourage you to build it and share it!</p>
<p>Think about it...</p>
<p>You may not even be interested in the music but your whole purpose might be to create a fun house, a giant castle, a water station, a fire-spewing dragon.... </p>
<p>To have a festival that truly caters to EVERY ONE of all ages!</p>
<p>MAGIC!!!!!!!</p>
<h2>THE SUPER HUGE POINT we have to stress is the shier size of the venue we are currently calling home.  </h2>
<p>It's literally MILES of open fields, trees, and gorgeous land!!!  The ability to grow this festival into the largest Midwest festival...  it isn't just a dream.. THIS IS a very very REAL thing! </p>
<p><em>We NEED your help to make this possible</em>.</p>
<h2><strong>What does PlunderFest provide for the artists who attend?</strong></h2>
<p>We provide a safe space that allows you as an artist to create your wildest dream creation.  It doesn't matter if you're a band and just want to create a large-scale stage show, or a visual artist who just wishes to create something magical.  PlunderFest will find a home for you on its massive grounds. </p>
<p>We would love to be able to help fund your creations for the show in the future. Outside of functional production costs we will some day have an overage.  Some of that overage will then be presented as an applicable artists fund.  </p>
<p>Lets say you have a creative concept that you would love to build for PlunderFest and this creation could be used to help benefit you as an artist AFTER the show.  You could put in for a PlunderFest grant and we could help fund your individual project.  This in turn would help us create a larger spectacle for the festival and allow you to grow as an artist, allowing you to take a piece of the festival home with you, your personal plunder. </p>
<h2><strong>What does your pledge mean to PlunderFest?</strong></h2>
<p>We dream in HUGE. We have always taken the words ""Go big or go home"" quite seriously. After 3 years of hard dedication in supporting the artists, we need your help to launch this project into hyperspace.</p>
<p>If we are able to reach a goal of $28,000.00 (set at $30,000.00 to allow for fees).</p>
<p>We can build a <strong>world first</strong> stage light show display.  <br/>This stage display would consist of a 28 feet of High Definition LED fabric and DMX controlled moving stage lights. <br/>((Think DaftPunk, DeadMau5, PrettyLights, AmonTobin))</p>
<p>With your pledges we would be able to purchase enough sectional LED fabric to cover a large scale outdoor stage, and roughly 20 Intelligent moving lights.</p>
<p>This concept lighting rig would allow us to change around our stage show each year, creating a different stage illusion, without adding to our production cost... <br/>allowing us to cater our production value of the show even further.</p>
<p>We would also be taking this rig on tour and bringing it to as many festivals around the nation as we can possibly schedule. We want you to see our passion in person.</p>
<p>We have already received sponsorship from the manufactures to help reduce the cost of this production to an affordable cost... however we need your help to be able to bring this to production to a reality.  </p>
<p>We know our goal of $30,000.00 is a large number to grasp at... so we have broken it down to its raw bare minimal functioning cost per panel.  </p>
<p>Each Panel will cost us roughly $4,500.00 in production and delivery.<br/>((lowering in cost of coarse if we are able to purchase more panels at one given time.))</p>
<p>We have set our goal at $5,000.00 to allow for fees, and stretched our goal timeframe to the max possible in order to fundraise as much as possible to reach our total goal. </p>
<p>If we receive anything above and beyond the amount we seek <br/>((as $30,000.00 barely scrapes the barrel of what we could do with the money...))<br/>it will go directly into the festival funding to create a better show for everyone. </p>
<p><em><strong>Other artist suggested projects include but are not limited to :</strong> <br/><br/></em>Solar LED's to light up the floor and trees.<br/>Solar color changing jellyfish to hang in trees. <br/>Wood for our large wooden phoenix remembrance sculpture we burn on Friday, Supplies to donate to our medical staff, (as they donate free time to us.)<br/>Advertising supplies,<br/>Gifts to give our ticket holders upon entree,<br/>Larger PlunderFest produced structures to build for ticket holders,<br/>starting our art fund FOR OTHER artists who don't have the money to fully fund a dream project<br/><br/>((we wish to pay it all forward))</p>

<p>Despite having a rich and vibrant creative community, the San Gabriel Valley and its neighboring cities do not have an annual literature or arts festival.  When you accept this invitation to help us, you are doing more than dropping a few digital bucks in our coffers, you are helping to invigorate the literary community east of Los Angeles, promote literacy, and establish a yearly tradition that will help others share the gift of the arts for generations. We want to give our area an outlet, and we want to support our local artists and writers and share their awesome work with the world.  We know we can give the Inland Empire and San Gabriel Valley a global voice.<br/><br/>When people in our area want to write or to see writers, they usually leave town. They go to Long Beach or San Francisco or New York. They shouldn’t have to. We have talent and even genius in our backyard. Help us to celebrate that genius. We have brought writing programs like Writer’s Weekend to Mt. SAC, but we want to bring something to everyone in the area, not just our students. Everyone can join in on the festival. Everyone can be a part of it.</p>

What We Need & What You Get
Running a free, public festival isn’t easy.  The City of West Covina has donated us the operating space, but we have many (many!) operational costs we still need to cover:
What we need --

Security
We need to pay to have the Festival Area guarded during the night (that way nobody makes off with all the art and literature!).

Author/Artist fees
Since we want to bring the best writers and artists possible to West Covina, we need to pay them a little to help them to travel here to West Covina and buy a sandwich or two.

Web Space
We run a very fancy website, but apparently need to pay for web space. Go see the website, it’s beautiful (and worth it!)

Promotion
We’re running the festival in an area that doesn’t have a traditional “art culture” & we need to make sure that everyone knows about the festival and has access to it.  This means passing out fliers (lots of them), 

Electricity
We’ll need to run sound, record the festival, and have the lights on after dark.  This means we’ll need to rent a few generators! Also, some of the writers are afraid of the dark.

Furniture Rentals
We’ve got to have places for artists to set their art and writers to scribble that writing.  Artists gonna art. Writers gonna write.

Any amount of money will help. If we don’t reach our goals, the funds we do have will go to bringing in generators and paying for security.
The Impact
Despite having a rich and vibrant creative community, the San Gabriel Valley and its neighboring cities do not have an annual literature or arts festival.  When you accept this invitation to help us, you are doing more than dropping a few digital bucks in our coffers, you are helping to invigorate the literary community east of Los Angeles, promote literacy, and establish a yearly tradition that will help others share the gift of the arts for generations. We want to give our area an outlet, and we want to support our local artists and writers and share their awesome work with the world.  We know we can give the Inland Empire and San Gabriel Valley a global voice.When people in our area want to write or to see writers, they usually leave town. They go to Long Beach or San Francisco or New York. They shouldn’t have to. We have talent and even genius in our backyard. Help us to celebrate that genius. We have brought writing programs like Writer’s Weekend to Mt. SAC, but we want to bring something to everyone in the area, not just our students. Everyone can join in on the festival. Everyone can be a part of it.
Other Ways You Can Help
If you can’t donate, you can still do a lot for us. 1.)We run an Amazon.com clickthrough -- use our clickthrough any time you shop on Amazon.com, Amazon will donate a small portion of the proceeds to SGVLF (at no cost to you or the vendor). 2.)Spread the word.  Visit our website for easily-shared banners, flyers, and twitter updates.3.)Speaking of Twitter, follow us on Twitter, become a facebook fan, and subscribe to our youtube.4.)Use the Indiegogo sharing tools5.)Come to the Festival on February 15th, 16th, & 17th!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Chalkmaster Dave and i've been making my living as a sidewalk chalk artist/painter for 20 years. I've had the privilege of traveling to diffierent countries for my work as well as across Canada many times. It hasn't always been easy, at one point i literally was down to $1.79... i bought one piece of black chalk... started drawing on the sidewalk and made a few dollars... i used that to buy a few more pieces of colored chalk...and now, now im Chalkmaster Dave and have dined with movie stars, travelled the world for my art, partied with rock bands and done shows for politicians in front of thousands... and been welcmed into homes from strangers i've met on the internet who've now become life long friends. i'm positive there will still be some rough times every now and then,  but i would choose to do nothing else if i were given a second chance.</p>
<p>My goal is to make a documentary called ""Operation: Chalk the Nation""<br/> as well as a book when it's all done.</p>
<p>about 4 Years ago i developed a fear of flying which lead me to drive everywhere i needed to go for my gigs. Over time i realized how much of a rush we are to get everywhere that we rarely take the time to enjoy the trip. We bypass so much by hoping from one airport to another. This country is absolutely stunning in it's geography and contains people from all walks of life with history and culture few people are aware of and through my specialized tpye of art performed at festivals i've been blessed to have seen and experienced this country in a way only a handful of us have. I want to show everyne i can through this documentary the power and the privilege art has in our lives and how its accepted, or not, by different people in different places. Along the way we learn about this country in a hands on approach and the adventure that this will undoubtedly become. This idea of mine is so important that i'm willing to give up most of my summer to do this...the summer is where i make the bulk of m money to survive my winters, but im willing to risk not making much money this season to make this documentary because i see a value here beyond just the money...i see the potential to open eyes and inspire and bring a view of this country to people in a way they've never seen before.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>the goal is $25,000. After fees for this site  and unexpected suprises I'm likely going to need a little more to pull it all together properly but im banking on being able to make some money with tips and or selling prints of my art between now and the end of the journey.</p>
<p>Gas i'm estimating to be around $2400, Equipment and supplies i estimate $3200, food and lodgings every few days so i can shower is going to be about $5500, i've estimated $2000 for vehicle maintenance as over 12,000 kilometres of driving is definitely going to do some wear and tear, 2 months of bills ie rent etc is $6200.</p>
<p>so without anything going wrong and zero issues along the way i would need at least $19,300 and i haven't even added cost of  a volunteer to film me and their food... so i can see $22,000 as an absolute minimum while still needing to sell some art on the way.<br/> Whatever i can raise i will use to make the best Documentary possible this summer... i'm aiming for the stars on this one even if it's against the odds and most will tell me this is impossible to raise.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Donate $10 or more and i will personally thank you by name in the documentary and in the book.</p>
<p>Donate $30 i will give you a signed print of my art.</p>
<p>Donate $60 and recieve 3 signed prints of my art.</p>
<p>Donate $100 and recieve a signed copy of the book as well as 3 signed prints of my art.</p>
<p>Donate $500 and recieve a signed copy of the book, 3 signed prints of my art, and an original 12""x16"" painting from me.</p>
<p>Donate $1500 and get all of the above and i'll stop off at your place of work or residence to do a personal sidewalk art piece just for you which will be in the documentary and be listed as an associate producer in ""Operation: Chalk the Nation""</p>

<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>One of the reasons i want to do this, even though it will take away profit from me this season, is to show everyone how wonderful this country is and how incredibly fortunate i have been over the years to make my living as an artist. I worked hard, and sacrificed a lot to make it but theres no way i could've made it without the support of people over the years. many times i;ve been down and broke and had no clue how i was going to get through, and then what seemed like out of the blue, someone backed me up, or bought my art, or showed me the way. Becoming a successful artist isn't about being the ""best"" artist... it's about the support you have from the people and your fans. I am not the best...there are many far more skilled than i am... but for whatever reason i was lucky to have support of people and i work hard to keep that support by giving back when i can and supporting other artists as well. Being an artist is not a linear goal for me... it's not about a financial goal so much as it is about bulding good connections with people. So long as there's enough money to pay the bills im happy living the rest of my life like the silly headed goofy artist that i am with the privilege of meeting and experiencing many more things with and for the people who support my craft.</p>
<p>I've taken on some big projects in my life... raised thousands of dollars  for animal shelters, a personal friends cancer medication, community projects, donated my time teaching art to kids and donating work for fundraisers to sick kids hospital, given away much art and supported other peoples goals... not for glory, but because i believe we're in this life together and if i dont share my gift the way others have shared with me then i simply don't deserve the support.</p>
<p>If you would like to learn more about me and what i do check me out on facebook, chalkmaster dave, ... i'm rough around the edges, i'm not extremely well spoken and sometimes i say too many silly things as stand up comedy is a little obby of mine so im always saying something weird lol. In the end... i'm just a guy whos had some glory thanks to others and this country i live in... if i can turn this experience into something positive for others and myself then i look forward to the challenge.</p>

<h2>A Lotus for you, the enlightened one will be. <b style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 24px;"">(Buddha)</b>
</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Hello
all! My name is Junichiro (Jun) Ishida, a visual artist based in Brooklyn, NY.
I am excited to launch this fundraising campaign to cover the cost of my art
residency in Wyoming to create a new body of work!</p>
<p>I was
born in the port city, Kobe, Japan, and came to the US two decades ago. My art
intertwines with my spiritual practice, Buddhism, and its aim is to bring tranquility in life.</p>
<p>I
paint the Lotus flower as a metaphor for the process of the
enlightenment. The lotus flower grows in mud and rises from it to bloom. Likewise,
people can bloom into the state of enlightenment by overcoming muddy
negative thoughts and emotions. </p>
<p>I was
accepted to the Jentel art residency, just outside of Sheridan, Wyoming for this winter. I am going there on November 15 and come back on December 15th. I am
very excited about the opportunity ahead. Getting accepted in a residency is
very important for me since It allows me to create bigger size of work than what my Brooklyn apartment can accomodate.</p>
<p> People often ask me how long does my piece take to be made. I
have pieces that I bring one residency to another, which sometimes are put in
suspension for more than a year. Being accepted residency is a competitive
matter. One needs to prove that the project is worthwhile by presenting
previous works and a proposal, to be judged by selection committee members
whom are respected in their field. </p>
<p> The Jentel residency will provide living space, studio,
and a small stipend to cover my food for one month residency. I am very excited
and thankful that I can have this very focused time to create my craft. But I need
your help.</p>
<p>During
the residency, I intended to further develop my <a href=""http://www.junichiroishida.com/lotus-painting-index"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""lotus"" series of painting </a>, and
create a <span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;""> <a href=""http://www.junichiroishida.com/mandala-installtions-index-page"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Mandala"" installation</a>, which is an interactive assembled piece on which viewers can practice walking meditation to get the sense of
serenity and calmness.</span><a href=""http://www.junichiroishida.com/mandala-installtions-index-page"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank&gt;""></a></p>

Hello
all! My name is Junichiro (Jun) Ishida, a visual artist based in Brooklyn, NY.
I am excited to launch this fundraising campaign to cover the cost of my art
residency in Wyoming to create a new body of work!
I was
born in the port city, Kobe, Japan, and came to the US two decades ago. My art
intertwines with my spiritual practice, Buddhism, and its aim is to bring tranquility in life.
I
paint the Lotus flower as a metaphor for the process of the
enlightenment. The lotus flower grows in mud and rises from it to bloom. Likewise,
people can bloom into the state of enlightenment by overcoming muddy
negative thoughts and emotions. 
I was
accepted to the Jentel art residency, just outside of Sheridan, Wyoming for this winter. I am going there on November 15 and come back on December 15th. I am
very excited about the opportunity ahead. Getting accepted in a residency is
very important for me since It allows me to create bigger size of work than what my Brooklyn apartment can accomodate.
 People often ask me how long does my piece take to be made. I
have pieces that I bring one residency to another, which sometimes are put in
suspension for more than a year. Being accepted residency is a competitive
matter. One needs to prove that the project is worthwhile by presenting
previous works and a proposal, to be judged by selection committee members
whom are respected in their field. 
 The Jentel residency will provide living space, studio,
and a small stipend to cover my food for one month residency. I am very excited
and thankful that I can have this very focused time to create my craft. But I need
your help.
During
the residency, I intended to further develop my ""lotus"" series of painting , and
create a  ""Mandala"" installation, which is an interactive assembled piece on which viewers can practice walking meditation to get the sense of
serenity and calmness.








What you get and what I

<p><b><i>OUR STORY</i></b><i>:</i></p>
<p>See a stately magnificent building and <b>PEOPLE’S</b> heads snap around. What<br/>secrets does it know? What musings can it tell? Did Al Capone hide any stash in<br/>those glossy gilded vaults inside?  After all, he and his gang vacationed in southwest Michigan. Hey, the first time I saw it, <b>MY</b> head snapped around. Still does. Every time I look at this amazing historical bank building that sits on Main Street in Benton Harbor, Michigan. Huge circular corrugated pillars that seem to climb to the sky. Rectangular white terra cotta blocks fading but still gleaming from it, like it’s a twinkling star or something. And a roofline with pointy pediment, a clock resting just below its apex. Oh, but that clock way up there…without hands, not telling time right now… may be telling us that unless we come together at an apex,  maybe this amazing icon’s slipping away from us. A year from now? Perhaps two. A crumble and a peel at a time. And once it’s gone, it may be gone forever. We’re in <b>DANGER of LOSING</b> it!

<p><b>Now for the really serious stuff...</b></p>
<p><b>About Saving the F and M</b></p>
<p>Time is ticking. Two, maybe even one year from now, it may be too late! But there’s still a chance to save the magnificent historical Farmers and Merchants Bank building. Beloved icon for more than 100 years, it sits stately at 92 West Main Street in Benton Harbor, Michigan. What an amazing place. It’s exciting! It’s revitalizing! Once threatening a ghost town, and after years of disrepair, the entire city’s in makeover mode, emerging as an arts district frequented by artists, dancers, musicians, photographers, and visitors. It’s bordered by St. Joseph, a thriving romantic tourist town right on Lake Michigan and a developing marina district on the St. Joseph River which boasts a brand new Jack Nicklaus Golf Course - Harbor Shores. It was proudly the site of the 73rd Senior PGA Golf Championship presented by KitchenAid in May 2012. And the Senior PGA will host the 75<sup>th</sup> in May, 2014. And good news. Recently, the PGA announced it will happen again in 2016 and 2018. But the F and M is falling behind all this progress. That’s important to know because restoration of the F and M will benefit the entire community and have a positive economic impact. We need your help to bring it back to life. And restore it to its original historic neo-classical beauty. </p>
<p><b>Its History</b></p>
<p>The F and M has a story to tell. It was established in 1888. By 1911, the owners (the O.B. Hipp name remains etched in stone East of the building to this day) gave it its present look: white terra cotta blocks, massive corrugated pillars, curlicue design at the roofline, and a pointy pediment housing a clock. Though long gone, the interior was finished in Italian marble and mahogany. Imagine the early 1900’s…A car hooded by a surrey-like canvas pulls up to 92 West Main. Women in big-brimmed hats and ankle-length dresses slide out of a speedster, maybe a roadster, followed by men dressed in top hats, taking a peek at their pocket watches. They enter the front doors talking, smiling. Perhaps they pause to admire the terra cotta blocks and architecture.</p>
<p><b>Disrepair; Fixing it</b></p>
<p>Nowadays, the F and M still enjoys admiring glances from passersby in Chevrolets, Fords, Chryslers, maybe a Honda or two. This building simply turns heads. But a closer look reveals pieces of terra cotta crumbling, pillars cracking and chipping, and the curlicues and pediment attracting birds keen on making this icon their home. Its bright face is fading. The owners did due diligence. They applied for grants but the money for those was scarce. They completed major repairs and renovations: a new roof drain system, stairway to the attic creating roof access, scraping, spackling, and painting walls, even shoveling and drying out the basement after a flood. And they installed netting to hold the terra cotta in place at the top of the pillars. “The upkeep has been a challenge,” says Tom Miller, co-owner and member of Smarts LLC (south of Main Arts). “But we keep on going.”</p>
<p><b>A Bigger Vision</b></p>
<p>Smarts has a bigger vision. As a writer, author, and award-winning playwright, Sherry Miller, a member, sees an “original works” theater showcasing award-winning children’s plays and experimental works; a creative place where talented writers will develop their scripts on the second floor. “We’d like to engage the local Benton Harbor High School for extracurricular classes/events as well as tap into local talent,” says Sherry. “And after initial development here, award-winning plays can find a full production home at the local high school’s state-of-the-art theater, or at colleges and universities.” The vision includes an event center, film studios, writer studios, classrooms, even retail and restaurant space. Renovated and ready right now is a hall for a non-for-profit photography gallery, a section of which will be dedicated to a<br/>museum with pictorial history of Benton Harbor. Amazing people live and work in the Benton Harbor Arts District. Because of their dedication, businesses are breathing life back into the community. There’s WaterStreet Glassworks (a success story giving students and artists an opportunity to learn glassblowing), the renowned Citadel Dance and Music Center, fashion shops, resale stores, art galleries (e.g. the world renowned artist; Richard Hunt’s studio), antique shops, offices, workout studio, the Livery Brewery, and many restaurants including Babe’s, Bread Bar, Chatterbox, Euneek Bakery, The Ideal Place, The Library, Lark’s Barbeque, Piggin’ and Grinnin’, and the Phoenix Café. Cornerstone (chamber of commerce), housed in another bank building behind the F and M, continues to play a prominent role encouraging entrepreneurs and supporting this community. And the New Territory Arts Association resides here. It just keeps on growing.</p>
<p> **NOTE: We’d like to see a culinary arts school here, too.</p>
<p><b>What Will It Take To ‘Save 92 West Main?’</b></p>
<p>People like you. Who believe in us. And our vision. And who believe in preserving history and architectural beauty. Our restoration project is divided into three (3) phases: fix and restore the façade, renovate space for theater and events, and repair and replace the elevator, electrical systems, and windows.  Estimates show it will total more than $150,000 to implement all three. A good start. So for right now, we are focusing on the first phase – the façade. Our goal? For the façade to be repaired for the next Senior PGA Championship presented by KitchenAid in May, 2014. And wouldn’t it be nice to surpass our goal allowing us to start the second phase at the same time? “When we first saw the F and M, we were mesmerized. Like those folks in 1911. Like those passersby today,” Sherry Miller offers. “A feeling of wanting to save it overwhelmed us. We originally invested in it to keep a gym from purchasing it. We just knew this building was more than sweaty workouts and treadmills. The F and M is meant to be admired like the treasure it once was.” We can do this. We can save 92 West Main.</p>
<p><b>Why Do We Need Money? And What for?</b></p>
<p>We, Smarts and Millers, extended our own resources to keep up with multiple repairs and tapped into our own personal finances. But a project of this magnitude requires so much more than what we’re able to give upfront. We’ve done estimates for these major renovations and they exceed $150,000. After deciding to concentrate on the first phase – the façade, we did a breakdown of costs for this campaign:</p>
<p>PHASE ONE:</p>
<p>Approximately, </p>
<p><u>$9,000</u> – </p>
<p>Marketing/Web/Media/Visual Media/Administrative. We will have some volunteers/interns available to help defray this cost. </p>
<p><u>$46,000 </u>–</p>
<p>Masonry, historically restoring the façade. (estimate available)</p>
<p><u>$3,000</u> –</p>
<p>Work to ready the Hallway Walk of Fame (scrape, spackle, paint). Any additional monies are allotted to dividing the electricity into individual units. And replacing windows. A certain amount of labor donated by Tom Miller and volunteers.</p>
<p>_________</p>
<p><u>$58,000</u> – Total start-up required.</p>
<p>**We are absorbing other costs such as some promotion, some writing, and administrative. We have offers from volunteers and are thrilled.</p>
<p><b></b> </p>
<p><b>Who Are We?</b></p>
<p>This IndieGoGo campaign was initiated by Smarts LLC, originally founded by Tom Miller, Sherry Miller, the Motts and R. Vance, and one silent partner (former school teacher) and supported by various arts affiliates locally and across the country, a big part by those associated with theater. Local BH entrepreneurs and community leaders also support this project. And have supported many of our grant applications and petitions. Smarts now is reduced to three (3) members.</p>
<p><b>Are Contributions Tax Deductible?</b></p>
<p>No. With the possibility of private investors in this building’s future and offering room for retail space as well as non-for-profit theater and non-for-profit Photography and pictorial museum wing, and because this project is not registered as a 501 ( c ) 3 non-for-profit and time restraints associated with doing that, contributions are not tax deductible.

But a project of this magnitude requires so much more than what we’re able to give upfront. We’ve done estimates for these major renovations and they exceed $150,000. After deciding to concentrate on the first phase – the façade, we did a breakdown of costs for this campaign:
PHASE ONE:
Approximately, 
$9,000 – 
Marketing/Web/Media/Visual Media/Administrative. We will have some volunteers/interns available to help defray this cost. 
$46,000 –
Masonry, historically restoring the façade. (estimate available)
$3,000 –
Work to ready the Hallway Walk of Fame (scrape, spackle, paint). Any additional monies are allotted to dividing the electricity into individual units. And replacing windows. A certain amount of labor donated by Tom Miller and volunteers.
_________
$58,000 – Total start-up required.
**We are absorbing other costs such as some promotion, some writing, and administrative. We have offers from volunteers and are thrilled.
 
Who Are We?
This IndieGoGo campaign was initiated by Smarts LLC, originally founded by Tom Miller, Sherry Miller, the Motts and R. Vance, and one silent partner (former school teacher) and supported by various arts affiliates locally and across the country, a big part by those associated with theater. Local BH entrepreneurs and community leaders also support this project. And have supported many of our grant applications and petitions. Smarts now is reduced to three (3) members.
Are Contributions Tax Deductible?
No. With the possibility of private investors in this building’s future and offering room for retail space as well as non-for-profit theater and non-for-profit Photography and pictorial museum wing, and because this project is not registered as a 501 ( c ) 3 non-for-profit and time restraints associated with doing that, contributions are not tax deductible. More details about the Farmers and Market Building and “Save 92 West Main” can be found on the website “Save 92 West Main.com” E-mail: save92westmain@gmail.com. Also find this campaign on Facebook: Facebook.com/BentonHarborRenaissance. Or type in: “Save 92 West Main.”

<p>     Hi, I’m Chris (playa name “Keys”), a 13 year burner who has decided I want my burn this year to be more interactive by helping people unable to attend Burning Man, vicariously experience it, as well as helping those that are attending, have an even more amazing experience!</p>
<p>     Actually, I’m taking a huge risk. In keeping with the principle of radical self-reliance I have decided not to purchase a ticket and instead decided to raise any and all money for ticket/food/gas by being your playa representative and, consequently, if I don’t raise the money, then perhaps this year I am not meant to be on the Playa.</p>
<p>     Since my first burn in 2000 I have participated in many different ways: I have created fallout shelters and crashed ship dance clubs, given away root beer floats and playful whippings, hosted artists for dinner and help set up major theme camps. I’ve experienced just about every life event you can think of on the playa, including birthday parties, engagements and weddings.  I’ve even placed the ashes of two fellow campmates in the Temple, one being one of my original four campmates from my very first year.</p>
<p>     This year I want to give back and use my burner knowledge and experience to help others and earn my way back. I have created perks that will allow both those on and off the playa an opportunity to enhance their experience. For those on playa, I offer my knowledge, abilities and resources. For those off playa, I offer the opportunity to vicariously experience the playa with me as your avatar. For those that have never even been, maybe you just want a piece of Burning Man and a better understanding of what this whole crazy event is all about and hopefully I can help with that desire.</p>

<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i50.tinypic.com/w8x6jn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>When I was 13 years old I began going to local punk shows. Apart from the memories, my favourite thing to take with me from these gatherings were 1"" buttons (aka: pinkbacks). I would pin them on my jacket, my schoolbag, my jeans, or just leave them scattered about my house. As a gift when I was 17 my parents purchased me a 1"" button machine. This was a dream! I couldn't be stopped! I made them for my friend's bands, as gifts, mementos for family members, even button making parties! The list goes on and on.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i47.tinypic.com/2zrdulc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>A couple years back a 'friend' asked if he could borrow my button machine. This was no problem for me, as it was common for me to loan it out. What's the point of having anything if it can't be shared, right?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i46.tinypic.com/i2n5h1.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></p>
<p>I left town for a couple weeks, and when I returned I had a difficult time getting ahold of my friend who had borrowed the machine. I was then informed that he had the intentions of moving across the country. He left - I can only assume with my button machine and I haven't heard from him since. 3 years of friendship toss asunder over a button machine? It seems surreal, I know...</p>
<p>Aaaannyway...I miss it. I want a new one. I'd love your help!<br/><br/>The button maker itsself isn't that expensive. Indiegogo requires you to have a minimum of $500, but if we raise more money I may be able to get a better quality one, or maybe be able to make differnet size buttons, or maybe even a new printer so I don't have to make my prints at kinko's!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>

<h3>Artist Linda Carmella Sibio and Bezerk Productions have launched this Indiegogo fundraising campaign to support Sibio’s ambitious new body of work, “Economics of Suffering.”   Sibio, who has been indisposed due to serious (and costly) illness since 2008, made a remarkable recovery during the past year and has returned to working on her artwork full-time.  Due to her illness, funds have been tight, so Sibio is turning to supporters and art enthusiasts to help her bring her new work into the world.  <br/><br/>
</h3>
<h3>Economics of Suffering</h3>
<p>Economics of Suffering is an artistic exploration into the psychological effects of a world economy that is collapsing and creating a fertile bed for individual pain and suffering. The images explore issues such as starvation, AIDS, blue-collar workers, healthcare, torture and genocide. <br/><br/>The  multimedia project includes live performance, 36 epic paintings, sound, video, and two very strange closets.  The full-length performance piece is Sibio's first since 2006.  She will also create a haunting soundtrack using a vocal distortion machine.  Blake Matthew Brousseau will use found images, created images and his unique blend of short clips with emotionally impacting imagery.<br/><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>$3000 will pay for the supplies needed to launch this epic masterpiece. </p>
<p>Contributions will fund the painting supply costs for dozens of Linda Carmella Sibio works on paper and other project elements.  Specifically, funds will be used to purchase paint, archival paper, gold leaf, framing, and video production services. </p>

In 1985, I assisted in starting The Los Angeles Poverty Department (a homeless performance art troupe on skid row in Los Angeles, CA).  During this year I started working with the homeless mentally ill which affected my work for the next 20 years.<br/><br/>I am very much interested in the fringe of society and how that affects culture as a whole. I have combined strong social issues such as homelessness, mental illness, suicide, mass murder, gangs, drug addiction and prostitution with progressive elements in design and form thus creating my own sub-culture language. Madness has been a dominant theme in my work having been influenced by my own diagnosis as schizophrenic and my mother’s incarceration in mental hospitals for 15 years during my childhood.<br/><br/>My philosophy was developed through a combination of personal experience and intellectual pursuits. My perceptions were influenced by Marcel Duchamp’s book “The Bride Stripped Bare by the Bachelor’s Even,” Foucault’s “Madness and Civilization”, “Theater and It’s Double” by Antonin Artaud and “Anti-Oedipus” by Deleuze and Gautier. Visually in design my work was developed from looking at medieval manuscript paintings, ancient ruins, Mayan hieroglyphs, Soutine, Hieronymous Bosch, and Van Gogh.<br/><br/>Although my visual art training stems from an academic background I have replaced these design techniques with that from my research into the perceptions of the insane. I have taken “symptoms” of insanity and transposed them into techniques for making experimental art. These methods include fragmentation, interrupters, non-linear time sequencing, multiple layers of images and stories, dismemberment, psychological torture, broadcasting, delusions and hallucinations. These techniques have lead to work where there are layers and layers of images leading to an epic effect.<br/><br/>Through teaching mentally disabled persons I create a microcosm or a sub-culture against which the voice of social consciousness, politics, philosophy and visual art can be explored. In this exploration I recognized the need to integrate that, which is mad into my core thinking. It is through this that I am able to function in the context of a fragmented world.<br/><br/>My philosophical stance includes the modern day ostracizing of the insane from a productive society. In ancient times the insane were looked to for insights and guidance, today they clean dishes and bus tables. We can learn a lot about our society and culture by how the mad are treated. As we dispose of human beings so then we go toward a disposable culture.<br/><br/>The fragmented thinking of the schizophrenic is actually a window into the placement of our culture. We are living in a deconstructed world no longer thinking linear thoughts. Our perceptions are continually interrupted by television, Internet, video surveillance, the media – we no longer have a single thought. We think in a multi-layered complex pattern. In order for our culture to go forward the darkness of the dismembered body needs to come into the light. We need to fragment in order to become whole again.  </p>

</div></div>","Hi!My name is Barbara. I'm the founder of Cadeauté Bold Designs and the designer behind Cadeauté's creations. In 2006 I started to dream of learning Pottery. I didn't know anything about it back then, but I knew that I wanted to put my hands in the clay on a wheel and create.The opportunity to learn Pottery came in January 2013. Four courses later, my love for it has grown stronger, as well as my desire to have a pottery studio at home and share that passion through Cadeauté.

</div></div>","Be A Part Of An AMAZING Biblical Experience!

If you believe in the Bible, then you've seen perhaps some of the world's greatest artwork portraying religious scenes.  You can be part of strengthening the cause of Christ and help change lives for the good!  With your support, you’ll help to establish a vision of world-class ""Bible in Art Galleries"" that take guests on a pictorial journey through the great stories of the Bible.

The curators are planning to build the inspiring “Bible in Art Galleries” in multiple locations across the nation.  The first ""Bible in Art Galleries"" will be established in Salt Lake City, UT with additional locations planned for Branson, MO, Nashville, TN, Washington DC, and many others!
Our Galleries are biblically based and will present reproductions of hundreds of breathtaking biblical art created by the old masters to the contemporaries of today.

Inspiring!  Uplifting!  Amazing!
Featured paintings will be organized and displayed in 10 biblically themed galleries.  Beyond that, themed specialty Galleries will be featuring breathtaking artistic works that depict God and Country, and Americana art.




Fun And Educational!
Throughout the Galleries, visitors will find fascinating biblical and “Did You Know?” exhibits that teach unusual and fun Bible facts.  These interactive resources give scriptural insight into the biblical stories behind each painting and help guests understand the culture and times when the Bible was authored by great men and women of God. 


Here's How We Start And How You May Help 
In today’s world it’s continually becoming more difficult to find quality, wholesome entertainment.  We wish to provide uplifting entertainment for all to enjoy and have secured an incredible building at the Gateway Mall in Salt Lake, Utah, in which we would like to open the nation’s first “Bible in Art Galleries”.

This property is a beautifully remodeled facility where the Arnold Friberg art exhibition was held several years ago.  This outstanding facility will become home to the nation’s first ""Bible in Art Galleries"". 











There will always be something fun to do at the Galleries!  The Celebration Theater will offer continual showings of quality movies.  Live “Christian Praise Bands” will perform mini-concerts every Saturday! The Galleries will partner with a wide selection of favorite restaurants to offer a “Date Night” experience of dining and art.  Those living in assisted living and nursing homes will be treated to monthly field trips to the ""Bible in Art Galleries"".  Guests may explore God’s underwater creations at the Living Oceans Virtual Aquarium while enjoying a snack at the Galleries Deli.  Incredible brick sculptures and mosaics made from LEGO(r) pieces including Noah’s Ark and the animals, the Tower of Babel, and much more will be on display! 

What will the crowdfunder money be used for?

Purchase of 20 high def video screens- for interactive media shown at the Bible in Art Galleries!
Purchase of Epson 8980 Giclee Printer - for use with reproductions.
Varnished canvas on which the art is printed and framing of images featured in the Galleries - for the best quality reproductions possible!
Appropriate furnishings that will be placed throughout the galleries for guest's comfort.
Security system - to provide security of the art and artifacts contained in the Galleries.
Shuttle van - will be used to provide free trips from the airport, ski resorts, major hotel/motels and other major attrations near Salt Lake city to the Bible in Art Galleries at the Gateway!

</h2><h2>The Story of SPARKcon </h2>
<p>SPARKcon is an interdisciplinary creativity, art &amp; design 
festival produced by the non-profit creativity incubator, Visual Art 
Exchange, in Raleigh NC. SPARKcon 2014 will be the 9th annual event and 
will be held Sept. 11-14 in downtown Raleigh.</p>
<p><strong>September 2014 will be our nineth annual SPARKcon.</strong> Each
 year we activate an open-invitation group of volunteers. SPARKcon is 
open to any passionate individual or group who wants to get involved. 
We’re grass roots—our money comes from our pockets and the pockets of 
others excited to support local creativity. The ideas and showcases come
 from inspired people who have the ingenuity to say “What if…?” and the 
motivation to then help make it happen.</p>
<p>SPARKcon’s “creative potluck” of SPARKs or creative themes such as 
art, music, film, fashion, geek, circus, etc.  is put together by 
passionate individuals who volunteer their expertise and are deeply 
embedded in a specific local scene. Using a combination of networking 
and open calls for participants, organizers create diverse and 
representative events to show off local talent and connect disparate 
creative scenes. </p>
<p><strong>This year, we have over 80 organizers, hundreds of local 
talents will be showcased, hundreds of volunteers will helping behind the scenes 
and thousands of attendees. All of these people equal SPARKcon.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>Gallery of Awesomeness</strong></h2>
<p><strong>See the <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/sparkcon-2013-igniting-the-creative-hub-of-the-south/x/1117345?c=gallery"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">gallery of images and a video explaining the opensource model</a> from past SPARKcons!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><h2>Why We Gogo</h2>
<p>As SPARKcon grows, so does the budget (ain't it funny how that 
happens?). This year, we anticipate budgetary needs to be upwards of 
$200k: $100k in in-kind donations (meaning totally awesome people and 
organizations donating their time or their stuffs) AND $100k+ of cold 
hard cash to make it happen. All this money goes to the production and 
logistics of the events. Most of the organizers, the visionaries and 
talent are passionate volunteers.</p>
<p><strong>Indiegogo is such a beautiful representation of a 
community-based funding process, that we have to embrace it! Our goal is
 to realize at least 10% of our cash budget needs through this Indiegogo
 campaign.</strong></p>
<p>Each year, we ask for our community to engage with SPARKcon and help 
make it happen through awesome contributions of time, talent, know-how 
and, yes, money. </p>
<p><strong><em>Your support helps make it happen! The budget goes towards:</em></strong><br/><br/>• Creating a super festival featuring 2,000+ local creatives in 200+ events!<br/><br/>• Allowing SPARKcon to be free and open to everyone!</p>
<p>• Paying sound techs, stage and lighting techs and other production talents</p>
<p>• Renting equipment like video screens and projectors and buying supplies</p>
<p>SPARKcon keeps the Triangle creative. By helping artists plan their 
own showcases and grow their professional skill sets and networks, this 
festival helps build careers and create leaders. And educate everyone 
about the next big thing! </p>
<p><strong><em>What happens if we don't meet our goal?</em></strong><br/>We
 will always have SPARKcon! Our artists always find a way! That said, 
your support is needed to help us purchase supplies, pay artists, build 
new audiences and inspire more people.</p>
<h2>This year is so SPARKly!</h2>
<p><span>SPARKcon grows every time a new person gets involved with a 
SPARK category, creating their own event, or joining in to help an 
existing one. <strong>It’s an open-source, “for the people, by the people” approach with an intentionally dynamic focus </strong>and
 will feature 2,000 artists in 200+ events. Each segment of the creative
 community plans their own ""SPARKs"" to showcase their talent.</span></p>

<br/><p></p></div>","The Story of SPARKcon 
SPARKcon is an interdisciplinary creativity, art & design 
festival produced by the non-profit creativity incubator, Visual Art 
Exchange, in Raleigh NC. SPARKcon 2014 will be the 9th annual event and 
will be held Sept. 11-14 in downtown Raleigh.
September 2014 will be our nineth annual SPARKcon. Each
 year we activate an open-invitation group of volunteers. SPARKcon is 
open to any passionate individual or group who wants to get involved. 
We’re grass roots—our money comes from our pockets and the pockets of 
others excited to support local creativity. The ideas and showcases come
 from inspired people who have the ingenuity to say “What if…?” and the 
motivation to then help make it happen.
SPARKcon’s “creative potluck” of SPARKs or creative themes such as 
art, music, film, fashion, geek, circus, etc.  is put together by 
passionate individuals who volunteer their expertise and are deeply 
embedded in a specific local scene. Using a combination of networking 
and open calls for participants, organizers create diverse and 
representative events to show off local talent and connect disparate 
creative scenes. 
This year, we have over 80 organizers, hundreds of local 
talents will be showcased, hundreds of volunteers will helping behind the scenes 
and thousands of attendees. All of these people equal SPARKcon.

Why We Gogo
As SPARKcon grows, so does the budget (ain't it funny how that 
happens?). This year, we anticipate budgetary needs to be upwards of 
$200k: $100k in in-kind donations (meaning totally awesome people and 
organizations donating their time or their stuffs) AND $100k+ of cold 
hard cash to make it happen. All this money goes to the production and 
logistics of the events. Most of the organizers, the visionaries and 
talent are passionate volunteers.
Indiegogo is such a beautiful representation of a 
community-based funding process, that we have to embrace it! Our goal is
 to realize at least 10% of our cash budget needs through this Indiegogo
 campaign.
Each year, we ask for our community to engage with SPARKcon and help 
make it happen through awesome contributions of time, talent, know-how 
and, yes, money. 
Your support helps make it happen! The budget goes towards:• Creating a super festival featuring 2,000+ local creatives in 200+ events!• Allowing SPARKcon to be free and open to everyone!
• Paying sound techs, stage and lighting techs and other production talents
• Renting equipment like video screens and projectors and buying supplies
SPARKcon keeps the Triangle creative. By helping artists plan their 
own showcases and grow their professional skill sets and networks, this 
festival helps build careers and create leaders. And educate everyone 
about the next big thing! 
What happens if we don't meet our goal?We
 will always have SPARKcon! Our artists always find a way! That said, 
your support is needed to help us purchase supplies, pay artists, build 
new audiences and inspire more people.
This year is so SPARKly!
SPARKcon grows every time a new person gets involved with a 
SPARK category, creating their own event, or joining in to help an 
existing one. It’s an open-source, “for the people, by the people” approach with an intentionally dynamic focus and
 will feature 2,000 artists in 200+ events. Each segment of the creative
 community plans their own ""SPARKs"" to showcase their talent.

The convent, which no longer exists, was located in Piazza San Marco and was governed by that monastery’s friars.</p><p>Contrary to how we might imagine convents today, in the Renaissance they were home to many wealthy, educated women, and these women enjoyed freedoms that their married counterparts did not. One of these was to pursue an artistic career, considered inappropriate and downright impossible for women. Noble women might paint small canvases as dilettantes, but could not sell their work.

In this context where craftsmanship was key, she taught herself art using drawings and prints and began to sell her paintings. Recent studies of the convent account books reveal that, as demand for Nelli’s art grew, she instructed her sisters and set up an actual painting workshop, parallel in organization to the ones by her lay counterparts, whose income made the convent self-sufficient. The full extent of this workshop and its impact has yet to be studied.</p><p>Giorgio Vasari, who is considered the first art historian, mentions Nelli in his important book about the <i>Lives of the Artists</i> (1568 edition), saying ""she would have done wonderful things if she had had the chance to study as men do.""

Picture this. The painting is oil on canvas, and it’s <strong>huge</strong>: 22 feet wide and 5.6 feet tall, composed of numerous pieces of canvas stitched together and mounted on a wooden support. It depicts the biblical scene of Christ and the Apostles at table, when Jesus reveals that one of them (Judas, seated at the front of the table) will betray him.</p><p>There’s a lot that is remarkable about this painting. First and foremost, think about how <strong>massive</strong> the task must have been for a woman at this time, an artist who likely received no professional training at all! Even just facing the blank canvas must have been daunting. Firstly, she had  to lay out the composition, which she would have done by drawing large cartoons and transferring their outlines to the canvas. Then she had to have the willpower and downright patience to cover that 14 square meters or so in paint, sometimes using the smallest of brushes.</p><p>Another very interesting fact that emerges is that one does not go about stretching a canvas like this on one’s own. Nelli must have <strong>engaged outside workmen</strong> to build the frame and prepare the canvas, which adds to our understanding of a rather open, permeable convent in which these women lived.</p><p>And last but not least, Nelli had the ability and pure guts to paint a subject matter that her contemporaries considered the <strong>ultimate test of artistic ability</strong>. She looked to Leonardo da Vinci’s famous fresco in Milan (which she knew probably through prints), as well as to important examples nearby. She was the first woman artist to deal with this topic, and as far as we know, she was also the last.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487174093/empiiqlnijkzfemotuuu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Nelli’s<i> Last Supper</i> is in dire need of restoration; it has lost a lot of paint that hinders its legibility. The convent of Santa Caterina da Siena was closed under Napoleon, and it seems that the painting was rolled up and put in storage for some time before it found a new home in the monastery of Santa Maria Novella, where until recently it was hung in the monks’ private dining room.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487177778/xcxoiy8zaxfmftewmaly.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><i>[In this detail of the left side of the painting, the restorer has removed the varnish and in-painting to reveal the artist's own color choices and brushstrokes.

Consolidation of the work on its support: being made of multiple pieces of canvas stitched together, it has started to sag. Removal of a thick yellow varnish that was applied in the past, to reveal the original paint. Conservation of the original paint where it is flaking off. Conservative infilling where paint has been lost.

Rossella Lari is perhaps the person who is closest to Nelli right now, quite literally as she works millimeter by millimeter on the painting. Through observation, aided by high-tech machinery, she will write a restoration report about Nelli’s painting that will be a first step to guide future scholarship.

Thank you!AWA will put any further funds towards collateral projects related to the restoration of Nelli’s masterpiece. The amount we set out to raise here on Indiegogo is just enough to cover the restorer’s fees, but for every AWA project, as you know, we always produce a book to share the results of the research and restoration, and when possible also a documentary film. These are additional costs that we consider well spent because this material helps spread the word about women artists and their achievements.  Plautilla Nelli was an important artist in sixteenth-century Florence, Italy. Her paintings were found in churches and in the homes of many nobles. Yet until about 10 years ago, few had ever heard of her, and she’s still not a household name. We at the Advancing Women Artists Foundation (AWA) want to change that, and the fact that you’re reading this is a first step!Nelli was the starting point for our first decade of research and restoration; now we hope Nelli will inspire you to get involved in the restoration of her greatest masterpiece - a 22-foot canvas depicting a Last Supper, a subject that no woman before or after her has addressed.This is #TheFirstLast: the First ""Last Supper"" by a woman, by the First documented female artist in Florence. It is the largest work of art by an early modern woman. It has been hidden from the public eye for 450 years and this restoration will put it, and Nelli, in the spotlight.Women from all around the world have gotten behind this project, putting their energy and enthusiasm into it. Listen to their own words about why THEY support Nelli! 

 
  
NOTE: Advancing Women Artists Foundation is an American not-for-profit (501c3). Your contributions here on Indiegogo are tax deductible in the USA.  Our founder, philanthropist Jane Fortune, “met” Nelli on a visit to Florence’s San Marco Museum in 2005. Nelli’s painting, Lamentation with Saints, moved her; Nelli as an artist intrigued her. This is the first documented woman painter of Florence, who was celebrated in Vasari’s Lives and had created a vast body of works, but Jane, an art lover, had never heard of her. She asked herself: “how many other works by women are hanging on museum walls or hiding in storage, forgotten by history?”.[Jane Fortune looking at a Lunette painted by Plautilla Nelli at the San Salvi museum in Florence]Sparked by Nelli’s formidable talent, Jane embarked on a quest to uncover more works by women artists in Florence. She and her team made an inventory of over 2,000 paintings, drawings and sculptures by women from the 16th to the 20th centuries. Many of these are in storage and are in need of restoration. Jane created the Advancing Women Artists Foundation (AWA) to help them get out of storage and into the public eye. In the past decade, the foundation Fortune established has restored over forty of these works, and shed further light on them through books and documentaries for the general public, such as the Emmy-award-winning PBS documentary “Invisible Women.”Polissena Nelli was born in Florence 1523; at the age of 14, in 1538, she entered the Dominican convent of Santa Caterina da Siena and took her vows as a nun, adopting the name Plautilla. The convent, which no longer exists, was located in Piazza San Marco and was governed by that monastery’s friars.Contrary to how we might imagine convents today, in the Renaissance they were home to many wealthy, educated women, and these women enjoyed freedoms that their married counterparts did not. One of these was to pursue an artistic career, considered inappropriate and downright impossible for women. Noble women might paint small canvases as dilettantes, but could not sell their work. By being a nun artist, Nelli broke the mold.[Plautilla Nelli, Lamentation with Saints, Museo di San Marco, restored by AWA]Nelli’s convent was initially known for the production of terracotta objects. In this context where craftsmanship was key, she taught herself art using drawings and prints and began to sell her paintings. Recent studies of the convent account books reveal that, as demand for Nelli’s art grew, she instructed her sisters and set up an actual painting workshop, parallel in organization to the ones by her lay counterparts, whose income made the convent self-sufficient. The full extent of this workshop and its impact has yet to be studied.Giorgio Vasari, who is considered the first art historian, mentions Nelli in his important book about the Lives of the Artists (1568 edition), saying ""she would have done wonderful things if she had had the chance to study as men do."" We believe she has done great things, and we're working to discover and restore them, one by one.(This pre-restoration image shows the grimy yellow varnish that was used to cover the painting's fine details, and the in-painting added centuries ago where original paint is lost.)The Last Supper is Nelli’s largest and most ambitious work, painted for the nuns’ dining room in her own convent. Picture this. The painting is oil on canvas, and it’s huge: 22 feet wide and 5.6 feet tall, composed of numerous pieces of canvas stitched together and mounted on a wooden support. It depicts the biblical scene of Christ and the Apostles at table, when Jesus reveals that one of them (Judas, seated at the front of the table) will betray him.There’s a lot that is remarkable about this painting. First and foremost, think about how massive the task must have been for a woman at this time, an artist who likely received no professional training at all! Even just facing the blank canvas must have been daunting. Firstly, she had  to lay out the composition, which she would have done by drawing large cartoons and transferring their outlines to the canvas. Then she had to have the willpower and downright patience to cover that 14 square meters or so in paint, sometimes using the smallest of brushes.Another very interesting fact that emerges is that one does not go about stretching a canvas like this on one’s own. Nelli must have engaged outside workmen to build the frame and prepare the canvas, which adds to our understanding of a rather open, permeable convent in which these women lived.And last but not least, Nelli had the ability and pure guts to paint a subject matter that her contemporaries considered the ultimate test of artistic ability. She looked to Leonardo da Vinci’s famous fresco in Milan (which she knew probably through prints), as well as to important examples nearby. She was the first woman artist to deal with this topic, and as far as we know, she was also the last.Nelli’s Last Supper is in dire need of restoration; it has lost a lot of paint that hinders its legibility. The convent of Santa Caterina da Siena was closed under Napoleon, and it seems that the painting was rolled up and put in storage for some time before it found a new home in the monastery of Santa Maria Novella, where until recently it was hung in the monks’ private dining room.[In this detail of the left side of the painting, the restorer has removed the varnish and in-painting to reveal the artist's own color choices and brushstrokes. It looks ""ruined"" but it is on its way to recovery.]The restoration job involves the following steps. Consolidation of the work on its support: being made of multiple pieces of canvas stitched together, it has started to sag. Removal of a thick yellow varnish that was applied in the past, to reveal the original paint. Conservation of the original paint where it is flaking off. Conservative infilling where paint has been lost. Florentine Conservator Rossella Lari has estimated that it will take her 1750 hours over 2 years to do this work.In this particular case, there is still a lot to learn about the Last Supper. Rossella Lari is perhaps the person who is closest to Nelli right now, quite literally as she works millimeter by millimeter on the painting. Through observation, aided by high-tech machinery, she will write a restoration report about Nelli’s painting that will be a first step to guide future scholarship. What she finds is likely to provide clues or answers to many things, from the work’s physical history to the specific iconography of the painting as she removes the grime to reveal previously unseen details.It is very rare for conservationists to have the opportunity to restore works by historic female artists, so when the opportunity arises, we believe that modern-day women should be given that chance. Restoration sponsored by AWA plays a dual role. On the one hand, it allows us to rescue paintings and sculptures from decay. On the other, it is a tool for reclaiming these artists’ stories, and in this case for reclaiming the usually man-centric historical period of the Renaissance.By restoring a work, we begin to study it, understand it, talk about it, and exhibit it. These are all essential parts of giving these artists’ their rightful place in history. You cannot love something you do not know. You cannot protect something you do not love. So, ultimately restoration gives people the opportunity to know and love an artist like Nelli.The Last Supper Team is supported by several ‘front-line’ volunteers based in Florence: Leslie Jmaeff, Lucia Bucciarelli, Poiret Masse, Margherita Agostini, Torie Gray and Ann Piper, who are art historians, students or art lovers committed to the project via cultural liaison work, press support, international communication and social media.  In addition this project is supported by the graphics and strategy team at Flod.Heading into our next decade, we want to continue Jane’s legacy by getting more people involved in AWA’s projects.

What We Need
Your help is greatly needed! The more you can give, the more fabulous this will be. To make this project successful, I need to rent lighting and camera equpment. I will need to pay workshop leaders and provide needed supplies like fabric, clothes, mask making materials, paint, digital storage, a stenographer, and props as well as drinks and refreshments.

<h3>WHAT NOW?</h3>
<p>Emma Katz at Recession Art has invited me to attend the <a href=""http://wassaicartistresidency.org/program/winter-residency/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wassaic Project Artist Residency</a> through the Recession Art / Wassaic Project partnership this coming April, and I would totally love to join the other three artists they have invited.  The residency costs $600 for the session running from April 2nd- April 30th, 2014, along with a $300 deposit.  I'll need to make the payment towards the residency on October 1st, and I'll be putting the rest of the money raised towards film &amp; development costs, as well as printing costs.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>A little about me:  </p>
<p>I'm a queer photographer whose work <span>examines the tension between representation and presentation, between the traditionally singular desire inherent in the photographer’s gaze, and the mutual desires involved in cruising, one night stands, and other casual encounters. </span> I recently finished my MFA in Photography at Columbia College Chicago, and just moved back to New York.  I now live and work in Brooklyn.  I like milk shakes in pretty much any weather condition, Roseanne, and My Bloody Valentine.   Funding through this campaign will go towards both the costs of the residency itself (roughly $900 for a one month stay) and towards the cost of supplies used in the production of a new series of images.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>WHAT ARE YOU SPENDING MY MONEY ON?</h3>
<p>So here's the breakdown of how much the Wassaic Project Artist Residency will cost:</p>
<ul>
<li>One month stay at the Wassaic Project from April 2nd to April 30th, 2014 - $600.  Includes room + board in one of their houses in addition to a studio space.</li>
<li>Security Deposit - $300. (Due with cost of residency on October 1st)</li>
<li>5 boxes of Fuji Provia 4x5 Slide Film (20 sheets each) - $350</li>
<li>Developing 100 sheets of slide film at <a href=""http://www.lti-lightside.com/?page_id=39"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">LTI/Lightside Photographic Services</a> - $300</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>WHY SHOULD I GIVE YOU MY MONEY?</h3>
<p>Funding would allow me to attend a residency program for the first time, allowing me both the opportunity to make work in a beautiful mountain setting and exposing my work to curators and critics who have no idea who I am otherwise.  It will also allow me time to explore ideas of gender, collaboration, and the muse, within the larger confines of my ongoing project <i>A Momentary Interaction</i>.  I will also send you awesome things, depending on how many clams you send me, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>$25 gets you a copy of my zine <i>A Momentary Interaction</i> and a 5x7"" print of the image used in the campaign, <i>Mark and I at the Beach (After Brooke Shields), </i>at an edition of 20<i>.</i>
</li>
<li>$50 gets you a copy of my zine <i>A Momentary Interaction</i> and an 8x10"" print of the image used in the campaign, <i>Mark and I at the Beach (After Brooke Shields),</i> at an edition of 10<i>.</i>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">$100 gets you a copy of my zine </span><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">A Momentary Interaction</i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> and an 16x20"" print of the image used in the campaign, </span><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Mark and I at the Beach (After Brooke Shields),</i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> at an edition of 2</span><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">.</i>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>GURL, I GOT BILLS TO PAY.</h3>
<p>Any help is good!  If you can't help with cash, spreading the word is always welcome:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share this on facebook, tumblr, and through email - however you see fit!</li>
<li>The Indiegogo share tools are easy and convenient!  Give a signal boost!</li>

I'm a queer photographer whose work examines the tension between representation and presentation, between the traditionally singular desire inherent in the photographer’s gaze, and the mutual desires involved in cruising, one night stands, and other casual encounters.  I recently finished my MFA in Photography at Columbia College Chicago, and just moved back to New York.  I now live and work in Brooklyn.  I like milk shakes in pretty much any weather condition, Roseanne, and My Bloody Valentine.   Funding through this campaign will go towards both the costs of the residency itself (roughly $900 for a one month stay) and towards the cost of supplies used in the production of a new series of images.



WHAT ARE YOU SPENDING MY MONEY ON?
So here's the breakdown of how much the Wassaic Project Artist Residency will cost:

One month stay at the Wassaic Project from April 2nd to April 30th, 2014 - $600.  Includes room + board in one of their houses in addition to a studio space.
Security Deposit - $300. (Due with cost of residency on October 1st)
5 boxes of Fuji Provia 4x5 Slide Film (20 sheets each) - $350
Developing 100 sheets of slide film at LTI/Lightside Photographic Services - $300




WHY SHOULD I GIVE YOU MY MONEY?
Funding would allow me to attend a residency program for the first time, allowing me both the opportunity to make work in a beautiful mountain setting and exposing my work to curators and critics who have no idea who I am otherwise.  It will also allow me time to explore ideas of gender, collaboration, and the muse, within the larger confines of my ongoing project A Momentary Interaction.  I will also send you awesome things, depending on how many clams you send me, such as:

$25 gets you a copy of my zine A Momentary Interaction and a 5x7"" print of the image used in the campaign, Mark and I at the Beach (After Brooke Shields), at an edition of 20.

$50 gets you a copy of my zine A Momentary Interaction and an 8x10"" print of the image used in the campaign, Mark and I at the Beach (After Brooke Shields), at an edition of 10.


$100 gets you a copy of my zine A Momentary Interaction and an 16x20"" print of the image used in the campaign, Mark and I at the Beach (After Brooke Shields), at an edition of 2.




GURL, I GOT BILLS TO PAY.

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>There is a lot I could tell you about myself, but what matters is that I am a creator and community-builder. I have worked as a visual artist, a writer, an editor, a dancer, a capoeirista, a teacher. In all of <a href=""http://giorgiasage.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">my work</a> I try to use language and connection to try to build a better and more equitable world. During my undergraduate career, I have come to decide that design is the most exciting and effective way for me to do that professionally, but have struggled to integrate that into the overwhelmingly historically corporate, profit-driven atmosphere of the professional design world at large. However, in recent years, other narratives about design have begun to emerge and gather steam. As I prepare to graduate and hurtle into an increasingly pre-apocalyptic world, I hope that my senior thesis project—an accumulation of my artistic and academic education at Wesleyan—will provide a foundation for my career and practice as a professional designer that foregrounds my passion for connectivity and reflection within the field.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>About ExpoNOW</h3>
<p>My thesis, ExpoNOW, is an examination of how the commodification of time and experience constructs identity and belonging amidst and among global social, political, and technological networks. Inspired by the history of world's fairs and their impact on the development of the globalized and networked world we live in today, ExpoNOW draws upon and critiques contemporary practices of branding, exhibition design, and marketing. It will take the form of an exhibition inspired by world expositions and trade shows, where the content of the exposition is the viewer themselves, in the present moment.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Here's where you come in.</h3>
<p>The fabrication and construction of any project of this scale has a huge material cost as well as a time cost. I've got the time (not enough, but a lot), but I don't have the money. I need to cover my materials costs for printing and building the displays in my exhibition, and for fabricating the exhibition's ephemera, which is an essential demonstration of the brand design's success and execution.</p>
<p>Some things I am making:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trade Show Display</li>
<li>Large hanging banners and graphics</li>
<li>Brochures</li>
<li>T-Shirts</li>
<li>Postcards</li>
<li>Buttons</li>
<li>Tote bags</li>
<li>Expo badges</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these have a material and fabrication cost that my own savings cannot cover. This fundraiser is not only a way to cover those costs, it is also a way for you to have a piece of ExpoNOW for yourself. It doubles as an e-gift-shop of sorts for the expo's branded goods.</p>
<p>I am not trying to make a profit from any of these products. The amount I am trying to raise covers all of my anticipated material costs for creating my ideal exhibition, with $300 padding to accommodate for the expenses I haven't calculated yet, but know will come up— namely the cost of plywood and paper for my the pavilion construction. Indiegogo also takes 5% of whatever I raise, and I hope to somewhat offset that.</p>
<p>Any leftover funds will be donated to <a href=""http://826valencia.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">826 Valencia</a>, an educational and creative writing nonprofit that has been instrumental in my growth and development, and has funded part of my own Wesleyan education.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When I realized I wanted to be a designer, I had a painful deliberation about whether or not I should transfer to a design school for their greater course offerings and professional resources. However, I chose to stay at Wesleyan because I realized that critical thought and interdisciplinary practice was not only essential to who I am as a person, but also because I decided that it was essential to being the best designer I can be. I <i>needed</i> the array of perspectives, knowledge, and skill that a liberal arts education would offer. I have never regretted that decision, but have had to be resourceful, independent, and tenacious in my education, and am admittedly graduating at certain disadvantages compared to peers who attended design schools. I have fewer connections, and a far more limited portfolio. This is why my thesis is <i>essential</i> to my future job prospects. The scope of the Wesleyan art theses provides possibilities and opportunities unavailable at many undergraduate schools. ExpoNOW will be the cornerstone of my portfolio after graduation, and the more fully I am able to realize it, the more it will help compensate for my different set of experiences and skills than art school graduate job applicants. The less I have to worry about overhead materials costs, the more successfully I will be able to realize the project and continue to contribute to essential discourses about the future role and impact of design on a world that needs transparency and equality more than ever.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello fellow sponsors!</p>
<p>I am a proud graduate of the University of Alabama Birmingham with a Bachelors in Theatre Arts.  I am a member of the Aurora Theatre Professional Acting Apprenticeship Company Class of 2018. I was selected to be a director for the 2019 Alumni Series based on my submission of Dutchman. In this series, directors are expected to self produce a play production. Everything from casting and  production team to marketing and fundraising is completely the responsibility of the director. </p>
<p>I believe that pictures are worth a thousand words and for me in art we get tons of pictures with a million words, out of one piece. 1960 to 2019 has quite a few similarities. One of the many  reasons I chose Dutchman. From my very first time reading it in undergrad, until being called upon to partake in this great opportunity. It has always left me with many answers. I hope that this piece as others holds true to the saying that a picture is worth a thousand words and spark what ever conversation needs to be had. </p>

<p>The world is full of assimilation where people try to be something that they are not; constantly trying to fit in, in a world that they don't belong to. This world is full of separation and judgement of things and people we don't understand.

<p></p>
<p></p>
</div><p>We are introduced as a couple 
from Croatia whose profession can be directly described as illustrators,
 painters and drawers. Our inspiration comes from the beauty of our 
nature and environment, the luminosity of our everyday surroundings , as
 well as, the tragedy and comedy within the human life. Our path has led
 us to the creation of wooden coasters for cups, plates and other 
serving dishes. However, this is not where our journey ends as we find 
pleasure in experimenting with wood  as well as recycling wooden 
objects.</p><p>Our vision defines 
wood in terms of environmental cleanliness and purity as this material 
shines with positive energy and warmth while also being perfectly 
adaptable to any home environment and decorative style.</p><p>Our
 motive and topic of our creation is evident through our picturesque 
illustrations of traditional Croatian sayings and inspirational quotes. 
Our hope is to provide a glimpse of Croatian culture and tradition 
through these illustrations of our folk sayings and quotes. Furthermore,
 our mission is to make your everyday special starting with the morning 
coffee that you drink- our coasters will separate you from your 
potentially-hectic-everyday routine and remind you that there is a 
lighter way. <br/></p><p>However, not only as a personally used product, we can say 
with certainty that as a souvenir for your loved ones, our products are 
not dust-collecting objects but rather serve its full purpose and 
potential. Our products are an ideal one-of-it's-kind detail in every 
kitchen and can also be a unique gift to anyone.</p><div>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get </h3>

We are introduced as a couple 
from Croatia whose profession can be directly described as illustrators,
 painters and drawers. Our inspiration comes from the beauty of our 
nature and environment, the luminosity of our everyday surroundings , as
 well as, the tragedy and comedy within the human life. Our path has led
 us to the creation of wooden coasters for cups, plates and other 
serving dishes. However, this is not where our journey ends as we find 
pleasure in experimenting with wood  as well as recycling wooden 
objects.Our vision defines 
wood in terms of environmental cleanliness and purity as this material 
shines with positive energy and warmth while also being perfectly 
adaptable to any home environment and decorative style.Our
 motive and topic of our creation is evident through our picturesque 
illustrations of traditional Croatian sayings and inspirational quotes. 
Our hope is to provide a glimpse of Croatian culture and tradition 
through these illustrations of our folk sayings and quotes. Furthermore,
 our mission is to make your everyday special starting with the morning 
coffee that you drink- our coasters will separate you from your 
potentially-hectic-everyday routine and remind you that there is a 
lighter way. However, not only as a personally used product, we can say 
with certainty that as a souvenir for your loved ones, our products are 
not dust-collecting objects but rather serve its full purpose and 
potential. Our products are an ideal one-of-it's-kind detail in every 
kitchen and can also be a unique gift to anyone.

What We Need & What You Get 

The above is who we are and what we do. In order to accomplish our 
mission, the following resources are needed. Below if our proposal to 
Indiegogo.

Opening of a physical lab of creative ideas
Purchase of tools for imaging (burning of the wood)
Purchase of tools for crafting of the wood
Purchase of a number of wooden surfaces for crafting/imaging (scraps of wood)
Purchase of water-based colors for the imaging (Eco-friendly)
Building of the company web-page and web-shop for the marketing of our products and services

<p>I grew up here in Devon before training in the creative arts, and then in horticulture, and I've always juggled these two passions, fascinated by how these skills helped to connect our ancestors very profoundly to the land in which they lived.

Deeply rooted in this ancient landscape of ours, my work draws heavily on folklore and mythology, and explores the deep connection, both physical and spiritual, between people and the land they inhabit.</p>

<p>I have spent the last 5 years creating The Green Wheel Oracle Deck, a set of 45 cards from my paintings. This is a set of divination cards that can be used in several ways:  to offer insights into situations, to suggest new ways of looking at things, and also to help you journey deeper into an awareness of the rythyms of the land and the skies.</p>

<p>The deck is divided into three sets: The 8 Wheel cards, which follow the wheel of the year, and mark the 8 celtic festivals - Imbolc, Spring Equinox, Beltane, Midsummer, Lammas, Autumn Equinox, Samhain and Midwinter.  The 13 Moon cards, representing the thirteen lunar months of the year, and 24 Companion cards, depicting animal and plant allies.</p>
<p>Finally, after years of work, it is ready to be put into production. I am working with a local print company, and we plan to produce a set of beautiful full coloured, high quality cards (89mm x 127mm) which will come with a cloth bag and a small book explaining how to work with the cards, in a beautiful presentation box.</p>

<h3><strong>Why do I need your help?</strong></h3>
<p>I want to produce this myself, rather than handing it to a publisher, because it's an intensely personal project, and I want to retain control of the content. It's taken me five years of hard work, with no financial return on the project, and I'd like to publish it myself.  What I'm doing here is launching it as a pre-order - so that the advance payments will fund the printing. I know that many of my customers have been patiently waiting for years to get their hands on a copy of this deck, and so I am offering the Green Wheel Oracle at a special pre-order price of £35 plus postage (please check the pre-order perks to make sure you choose the one with the correct postage for your country). This pre-orders should be ready to post by the end of November, meaning it can be ordered in time for Christmas. The size of the print run will be determined by the funding raised, but I am hoping to make an edition of 1000 units, which I plan to launch on the retail market later in the New Year.</p> <p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What's the money for?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I need to raise £10,000 to bring this to production:</p>
<p>£7000 for print and production costs</p>
<p>£1000 covers the percentage to Indiegogo, campaign costs, and pre-production samples (plus a small fee to my 12 year old nephew, Ruan Scott for his expertise and hard work in video creating and editing and tech advice!)</p>
<p>£2000 approx will cover the postage and packing of pre-orders and perks</p>
<h3>What am I offering in return?</h3>
<p>As well as the options for pre-ordering a deck, there are lots of exciting perks you can buy too!</p>
<ul>
<li>Special 'limited edition' sets of the Green Wheel Oracle, including extra tools for working with the deck, such as incense to use with the lunar months, and a beautiful handmade casting cloth</li>
<li>Small sets of Altar cards and incense</li>
<li>Limited edition large giclee prints of the 8 Wheel Cards</li>
<li>An incense making workshop (in the south west of UK) for up to 6 people</li>
<li>Some original paintings from the deck to be released for sale later in the campaign</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What happens if I don't meet my target?</strong></p>
<p>All the pre-orders and perks will be fulfilled, however much the campaign raises, BUT I will have to make a much smaller print run, and therefore am unlikely to have decks to sell after the pre-orders or to launch into shops in the New Year.</p>
<p><strong>And if I go over?</strong></p>
<p>There is so much more I can do with more funds! My priority will be framing the original artwork for exhibition and launch of the Green Wheel Oracle. This will cost about £2500. Extra funds would be put towards the launch and marketing campaign, and updating my website.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<p> </p>
</div><p><strong>Is there any risk involved?</strong></p><p>The risks are small for this project, as most of the work is already done. However, I haven't quite finished writing the small book that goes with the deck.

The printers, a very experienced company, have assured me that they can deliver the separate elements of the product within a month from giving them the go ahead, so I am confident it will be with me by the end of November.

<h1>Indiegogo updates</h1>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Nik Wallenda, and I’m a 7th generation daredevil from the Flying Wallenda family. I spent the past 2 years working tirelessly to lobby governments in two countries and change laws that have been in place for over a hundred years. Why?  I wanted to achieve my life long dream and be the first person ever to walk across Niagara Falls on a tight rope. On June 15<sup>th</sup>, that dream came true.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I live my life following a simple but powerful mantra- never give up! In 1978 my grandfather fell to his death walking a tightrope between 2 buildings in Puerto Rico. I recently did that same walk in his memory.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tight Rope is a performance art that has been passed down in our family for generations.

Indiegogo updates
 
My name is Nik Wallenda, and I’m a 7th generation daredevil from the Flying Wallenda family. I spent the past 2 years working tirelessly to lobby governments in two countries and change laws that have been in place for over a hundred years. Why?  I wanted to achieve my life long dream and be the first person ever to walk across Niagara Falls on a tight rope. On June 15th, that dream came true.
 
I live my life following a simple but powerful mantra- never give up! In 1978 my grandfather fell to his death walking a tightrope between 2 buildings in Puerto Rico. I recently did that same walk in his memory.
 
Tight Rope is a performance art that has been passed down in our family for generations. It is the apex of engineering and personal discipline requiring strength and sharp mental focus to keep balanced on a tensioned wire between two points. Tightrope walking is a part of American history and has been a form of popular entertainment since the circuses of the 1700’s. With this walk over Niagara Falls I wanted to elevate and evolve the art, just as my personal hero and great-grandfather Karl Wallenda did with the 7 person chair pyramid Flying Wallendas.
 
So why am I on Indiegogo? I may be the first man to be granted the right to attempt the walk, but I’m not the first who tried to seek permission. It was a long and arduous process that at times felt impossible. With the miraculous support of my family, friends, local and federal government officials, a lot of patience and persistence we did the impossible… and now I’m coming to you, the Indiegogo community to be that last bit of support that makes this possible.
 
One of the conditions of the walk was that I had to finance it myself. No government assistance was provided and in fact I had to pay for all government services. We have been able to offset most of these costs but not all of them. The unforeseen costs that popped up last minute are huge. I’m coming to you Indiegogo. Be a part of this important moment in history. Help me compensate all of the people that made the impossible happen.
 
I am asking for your help in raising $50,000. Thanks to everyone who watched the walk, and for all of your support. It means the world to me.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is <a href=""http://karonleigh.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Karon Leigh</a>.  I am an artist living in southeastern Arizona.  I moved to Arizona from the pacific northwest in 2008 for the sun and light.  What I found was incredible beauty, energy and creative inspiration.</p>
<p>Currently and historically, artists have made their way to the southwest for the light, the wide open spaces, the energy and the rich history of the American west.</p>
<p>Open Studio Tours are a unique opportunity to appreciate what its like to be an artist.  I am interested in how artists work in their spaces, how they set up their space for their particular medium and work style.</p>
<p>It is not my nature to ask for help.  I'm a very independent person and although I totally believe in community funded projects and what sites like Indiegogo can do, I am usually the giver, not the receiver.</p>
<p>So here's my project:</p>
<p><strong>Southwest Art Studios</strong> is an ongoing project to visit, interview and document artist in their studios in Arizona and New Mexico and to create an online web based ""Open Studio Tour"" to help promote artists and share their studios and their work with the world.</p>
<p>Most artists don't make a living from selling their art.  Artists work in many fields and often juggle multiple jobs in or order to support their families, pay the bills, buy their art supplies and have time in the studio to create their art.  I am fortunate in that I am able to work in a creative field managing art programs for a small non-profit.  I spend time in the evenings and on weekends creating my art.  I also teach art workshops in encaustic painting and monotype printmaking.</p>
<p>My studio spaces have been a closet, a garage, a room in the house, the dining room table, a commercial space with other artists, a casita, and currently, a small area off of the kitchen in my house.  No matter where we set up to create our art, whether we are selling our work in galleries or working multiple jobs, what all artists share and have in common, is the passion and need to create.  It is who we are.</p>
<p>It is my love of art and artists that inspire me to create this project.  I think artists need to be supported and promoted.  Art is fundamental and critical to a civilized society.  Art Saves Lives!</p>
<p>In June of 2013 I am taking unpaid time off of work to visit and interview artists in New Mexico.  I will be documenting their studio spaces with photos and video.  I am creating a blog and website, <a href=""http://www.SouthwestArtStudios.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.SouthwestArtStudios.com</a> to promote the artists that I visit.  In order to make all of this happen and get this project off the ground and onto the web, I need a little help from you to help offset my travel expenses.</p>

After a year of hard work alongside the photographers Alexandra Banti and Ultimate Psycho I finally present the creation of my portfolio ""Femme Fétiche, Femme Fatale.""<br/><br/>This portfolio will contain 12 A5 size photos, protected in a beautiful cover.

<br/></span></div><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I started as a model in 2007, lead by the fashion photographer Nicolas Meunier. Through this passion, I discovered a lot about myself. Modelling helped me to overcome my shyness and to assume my femininity. I always want to push myself and go beyond my own limit. Modelling is a rich and liberating form of expression.</span></p><div>

C'est un moyen d'expression très riche et libérateur.</i><br/></p>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">One year ago, I started a project with two photographers. We first wanted to make a calendar of my photos (a publisher asked us to do it, but it canceled when all our work was already done...). It was a real challenge for us: we had to shoot 12 unpublished photos in a very short time, and the biggest difficulty was innovating between each shot! We wanted to express many different sides of my personality and explore how I see eroticism and sensuality: Femme Fétiche, Femme Fatale.</span></p>
</div><div>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><i>Il y un an, nous avons commencé un projet de calendrier, commandé par un éditeur qui a malheureusement annulé alors que nous avions finit de réaliser toutes les photos. C'était un gros challenge pour nous: nous avions peu de temps, peu de moyens et nous devions innové entre chaque photo. On voulait montrer autant de facette de ma personnalité que possible;  et montrer ma vision de l'érotisme et de la sensualité: Femme Fétiche, Femme Fatale.</i></span></p>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">After several months of work, I have decided to do a more artistic project rather than a calendar. A calendar has a time limit: when the year is finished, what do you do with a calendar? Most of the time you throw it in the bin! How sad, right? I wanted a more durable object and still with an affordable price: the idea of the portfolio was born!</span></p>
</div><p><i>Après plusieurs mois de réflexion, j'ai décidé de proposer un objet plus artistique qu'un calendrier. En effet, ce dernier a une limite dans le temps.

</div></div>","Hello everyone! I am Nella Fragola, I've been an alternative model since 2007 and today I am very pleased to launch a project which is so dear to my heart! After a year of hard work alongside the photographers Alexandra Banti and Ultimate Psycho I finally present the creation of my portfolio ""Femme Fétiche, Femme Fatale.""This portfolio will contain 12 A5 size photos, protected in a beautiful cover. These new photographs will illustrate the theme of womanhood and sensuality. 


*****

Bonjour tout le monde ! Je suis Nella Fragola, je suis modèle alternative depuis 2007 et aujourd'hui je suis ravie de lancer un tout nouveau projet très cher à mon coeur ! Après un an de travail aux côtés des photographes Alexandra Banti et Ultimate Psycho, je suis enchantée de vous présenter mon portfolio ""Femme Fétiche, Femme Fatale"" 
Il contiendra 12 photos A5, protégé dans une pochette. Ces photos illustrent ma définition de la sensualité féminine.  

I started as a model in 2007, lead by the fashion photographer Nicolas Meunier. Through this passion, I discovered a lot about myself. Modelling helped me to overcome my shyness and to assume my femininity. I always want to push myself and go beyond my own limit. Modelling is a rich and liberating form of expression.
J'ai commencé à poser en 2007, guidée par le photographe de mode Nicolas Meunier. A travers cette passion, je me suis découverte. Cela m'a aidé à surmonté ma timidité et assumer ma féminité. J'aime me surpasser et aller au delà de mes limites. C'est un moyen d'expression très riche et libérateur.
One year ago, I started a project with two photographers. We first wanted to make a calendar of my photos (a publisher asked us to do it, but it canceled when all our work was already done...). It was a real challenge for us: we had to shoot 12 unpublished photos in a very short time, and the biggest difficulty was innovating between each shot! We wanted to express many different sides of my personality and explore how I see eroticism and sensuality: Femme Fétiche, Femme Fatale.

Il y un an, nous avons commencé un projet de calendrier, commandé par un éditeur qui a malheureusement annulé alors que nous avions finit de réaliser toutes les photos. C'était un gros challenge pour nous: nous avions peu de temps, peu de moyens et nous devions innové entre chaque photo. On voulait montrer autant de facette de ma personnalité que possible;  et montrer ma vision de l'érotisme et de la sensualité: Femme Fétiche, Femme Fatale.
After several months of work, I have decided to do a more artistic project rather than a calendar. A calendar has a time limit: when the year is finished, what do you do with a calendar? Most of the time you throw it in the bin! How sad, right? I wanted a more durable object and still with an affordable price: the idea of the portfolio was born!
Après plusieurs mois de réflexion, j'ai décidé de proposer un objet plus artistique qu'un calendrier. En effet, ce dernier a une limite dans le temps. Que faites-vous d'un calendrier une fois l'année fini? Vous le jetez ! C'est triste, n'est-ce pas? J'avais envie de réaliser un objet durable dans le temps mais accessible niveau prix: l'idée du portfolio été née !
A photo from Alexandra Banti, Femme Fatale / Une photo d'Alexandra Banti, Femme FataleWe are very proud of what we have accomplished. We hope you will enjoy the finished product as much as we do!There is no art without the artist to create it. And being an artist is a hard job to do for a living. If this project is dear to my heart, it is for all the artists who followed me into it as well: photographers, graphic artists, makeup artists, hair stylists... Talented people who deserved to be paid (not only money, but with all your heart too)!Your contribution will help us to cover all our costs:Printing of the portfolioEnvelop Postal costs (worldwide)Artists (2 photographer, 1 hair stylist, 1 make up artist, 1 co-model, 1 graphic designer and I as model)

Nous sommes très fiers de ce que nous avons accomplis. Nous espérons que vous aimerez le produit une fois finit autant que nous !
Il n'y a pas d'arts sans artiste pour le créer. Et être un artiste est un travail difficile à vivre. Si ce projet est cher à mon coeur, c'est pour tous les artistes qui ont cru en moi et m'ont suivi dans la réalisation du projet: photographes, graphiste, maquilleurs et coiffeurs... Artistes talentueux qui méritent d'être payés (pas seulement en argent mais aussi avec tout votre coeur) !
Votre contribution nous aidera à payer:

With those 2 000 € we could see our project in your hands! We won't be paid ourselves a lot. I especially wish to see the work of my team be paid as they deserved it. Artists should be able to live of what they create. Please, support the arts!

Who is Action Communiterre?We are a community organization based in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, which aims to promote food security and social inclusion. To achieve this, we have developed collective gardening and intergenerational cooking programs.Even though it is the heart of our work, our aim is not only to produce vegetables or prepare healthy meals. We also see gardening and cooking workshops as a means to achieve another objective: to create united and resilient communities. These activities become pretexts to bringing together members of the community, breaking down social barriers and building lasting friendships.For more information, visit: www.actioncommuniterre.qc.ca",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>A Passion for the Power of the Arts...<br/>

<p>In 2009 the core members of the Manifesto|Jamaica team started meeting...and meeting...and meeting. Meeting about what?...About what we were going to do to elevate Jamaica's Art &amp; Culture, bringing it to the forefront as an agent of personal, community and national empowerment, and how we were going to do it.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>Hello there!</p><p> Thank you for
finding your way to my crowdfunding campaign. As you may have guessed, I am
hoping to gather some money for something that is very important to me. But I
will get to that later, let me start by introducing myself:

</p><p>My name is
Meike Zane. I’m a 24 year old portrait artist from the Netherlands, with a
dream to turn my hobby into a career. Drawing, especially portraits,
is my passion and something I would do 24/7 if I had the chance. This dream all
started on December 31<sup>st</sup>, 2009. My dad passed away unexpectedly and
his last words, the evening before, were to me; that he was so proud of me and
my drawings. Looking back, my drawings really weren’t even
that good back then. But – his words stuck with me
and I decided I wanted to honor them by continuing to draw to the best of my
ability. Over the years that followed both that ability as well as my desire to
succeed became considerably larger. Now, we are here.</p>
<p>In order to be
able to continue growing in my art and become a professional artist there are a
few things I need. First of all, I need to move to London (UK). This small town
in the south of the Netherlands? It’s not gonna happen out here. But don’t
worry, I’ve got the London part under control. What I don’t have is the right
material to become better at my art and provide customers with the best
drawings I could possibly make. In short: I need better equipment.</p>
<p>I want to be
able to make works that are 100% mine, from start to finish. This means I want
to work with reference photographs that I took myself (whenever possible), but
unfortunately – my camera is old, and while I love it to pieces (... it's almost *in* pieces as well), it is just not good enough. I need a new camera, and
a few accessories – such as a lens, external flash, camera bag, and memory
cards – to go with it, to be able to make completely original works. This is
the main part that you, as a potential contributor, would help me with. Any
extra money acquired would go to other necessary items, such as better pencils,
paper, a good scanner (also very pricey), and more.</p>
<p><b>What I Need</b></p>
<p>After some
thorough research, both on the Internet to see what’s available, and in my
brain to see what I really need, I have compiled a short list of items and
their average prices that I really need to be able to start. Here they are:</p>
<p>Camera body:
Canon EOS 7D – approximately 1000 euros<br/>
Camera lens: Canon EF 85mm f/1.8 USM – approximately 350 euros<br/>
External flash: Speedlite 430EX II – approximately 250 euros<br/>
Additional accessories (camera bag, memory cards) – approximately 100 euros</p>
<p>This comes to a
total of 1700 euros. I set the target to 2000 euros, because with many of the perks shipping costs are included and I need to be able to pay for those. Any extra money received
could go to a better body/lens, or other equipment I will need such as a good scanner
(A3 preferably), paper, pencils, brushes, watercolours, ink, blending stumps,
erasers, portfolios, and so on and so forth. Maybe even help towards renting a
slightly larger room in London so I actually have enough space to be able to
create my artwork in the comfort of my own room. But as stated – that is all
secondary to getting the right equipment.</p>
<p><b>What You Get</b></p>
<p>Perks! Let’s be
honest, this is the most important part, isn’t it? What do you get for
supporting me? Well.. I don’t think this is a tough one to guess. Artwork! I am
an artist after all, what better to offer than artwork?</p>
<p>I have a few
perks available, ranging from 1 euro (a simple massive thank you for
contributing!) to 450 euros (the mega pack!). Included in these perks are
original drawings and sketches, Trees of Life, EXCLUSIVE prints, and postcards
prints (in case you love Benedict Cumberbatch.. and why wouldn’t you?).</p>
<p>The original,
custom drawings are offered on size A5 (5.8”x 8.3” / 148 x 210mm) and size A4
(8.3” x 11.7” / 210 x 297mm). The drawings are done with graphite pencils, and
are detailed realism:</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/893710/files/20140930122321-Papa001.jpg?1412105001"" src="""" style=""width: 280.815px; height: 399px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/893713/files/20140930122343-BenedictCumberbatch.jpg?1412105023"" src="""" style=""width: 274.119px; height: 388px;""/></p>
<p>The sketches
are on size A5, and are realism. They might not be detailed, but do capture the
essence of the subject. But please, do decide for yourself:</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/893723/files/20140930122528-SketchSpock.jpg?1412105128"" src="""" style=""width: 292.984px; height: 421px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/893724/files/20140930122547-SketchTomHiddleston.jpg?1412105147"" src="""" style=""width: 216.076px; height: 309px;""/><br/></p><p>Trees of Life
are lovely necklaces and decorations I’ve been making for about a year or two
now. You can see them as something spiritual, because of the idea behind the
Tree of Life (a tree that connects all life in this world) or because of the
gemstones. You can also just see them as pretty items:</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/893728/files/20140930122815-IMG_6207.JPG?1412105295"" src="""" style=""width: 511.269px; height: 340px;""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/893733/files/20140930122929-IMG_3820.JPG?1412105369"" src="""" style=""width: 511.5px; height: 341px;""/></p>You can find

<p>If I don’t
reach the target, I will still get the money – that’s how flexible funding works.
In that case I will set the money aside until I have earned enough (it might
take a while) to buy the camera and other necessary equipment. Trust me – your money
will only go towards my advancement in my career as a portrait artist, regardless
of whether I reach the needed funds now or in a few months/years.</p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>Are there any
risks &amp; challenges? Of course there are. There always are. What if I break
my arm and can’t create the perks for a few weeks? In that case it would take a lot longer to get all perks done &amp; shipped out.  I
promise I’ll try to not break anything though.</p>
<p>Do keep in mind
that creating custom drawings takes time. I will not be able to ship your
drawing within a week of the campaign closing (unless you’re among the first
ones I start with. Lucky you!). If you need the drawing before Christmas or any
other deadline, please ask me before contributing and picking that perk. If you don't ask me beforehand if I can make a deadline, I can’t make any promises to
have it finished and shipped (shipping might take a while if you don’t live in
the same country) before a certain day.</p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>If you can’t
contribute (aww!), but you do wish to
help me (yay!), you can try and get the word out about this campaign. Share it
with your friends, your family, your classmates, your colleagues, or your
networks on social media. Even if only one of them then contributes 1 euro, you
will have made a difference, for which I thank you.</p>
<p>If at all
possible, use the IndieGogo share tools – and make sure you are logged in to
your IndieGogo account when doing so. I can track referrals that way.. and.. <b><i><u>the
person whose friends’ contributions amount to the highest amount of money will
win TWO sketches!</u></i></b><u> </u> Remember – log in to IndieGogo and use the share
tools, otherwise the referrals will not be tracked and can’t be counted towards
your total!<br/><u></u></p><u>

<p></p>
<p>As the designer behind Paper &amp; Clay, I make modern functional ceramics that are designed to be both beautiful and very usable. I draw inspiration from my love of Scandinavian design — in the design of my forms and development of glazes, but also in a broader sense. I love having simple but well made elements as a part of my own home, and I strive to create work that fits that form.  </p>
<p>Each piece is made by hand with careful attention to detail, and each glaze has been carefully developed from scratch to create subtle and unique colors that mix and match harmoniously. I source many materials locally and all within the U.S. I’m committed to growing Paper &amp; Clay slowly and sustainably in order to build a lasting brand that is committed to quality handmade ceramic wares.</p>

Help launch a new mug, a saucy little addition to your morning coffee routine. I've been making this F-bomb Mug for friends and family only, but now I want to offer it to everyone, because everyone deserves to start their day with a ""Fuck Yeah!"" salute in 22k Gold. 

About Paper & Clay Paper & Clay is a modern ceramics line created by Brit McDaniel in 2013. 

As the designer behind Paper & Clay, I make modern functional ceramics that are designed to be both beautiful and very usable. I draw inspiration from my love of Scandinavian design — in the design of my forms and development of glazes, but also in a broader sense. I love having simple but well made elements as a part of my own home, and I strive to create work that fits that form.  
Each piece is made by hand with careful attention to detail, and each glaze has been carefully developed from scratch to create subtle and unique colors that mix and match harmoniously. I source many materials locally and all within the U.S. I’m committed to growing Paper & Clay slowly and sustainably in order to build a lasting brand that is committed to quality handmade ceramic wares.


   What We Need & What You Get The nitty gritty of what I need:  $500 to order custom gold decals for the mugs. I've been painting them by hand with the help of a stencil, but with the higher demand I want to move to the faster and higher quality method of Gold decals.  $850 for a small test kiln.

<strong>Crow Sourcing</strong> by <em>Andy Deck</em>
</h3>
<p>Do you have the ""memory of an elephant""? Are you ""wise as an owl"" or are you a ""bird brain""? How does the ""crow fly""? As ""crooked as a dog's hind leg""? Crow_Sourcing engages collective memory and insight to demystify and reanimate a dizzying array of sayings, idioms, and expressions like these. It's not ""snake oil"" – no, it's the ""cat's pajamas."" Or as they say in Australia, ""the duck's guts."" Hundreds of these idioms have been discussed and collected via Web, mobile, and social media for the past year. Now it's time to edit and publish the findings in a more durable format.</p>
<p>The purpose of this fundraising effort is to finance two print publications<em>:</em> a calendar and a book. Each will include original research and illustrations that complement the many, many expressions that connect us through language to the natural world.<em><br/></em></p>
<p><strong>Look what the cat dragged in</strong><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p>When I began this project I figured it would be interesting. But really I had no idea how much fun it would be to learn about animal expressions. It's more fun than a barrel of monkeys. With the help of many volunteers contributors, I have learned about the wide variety of expressions that are used around the world. In some cases these idioms reflect pre-industrial human civilization. Ideas survive in language that have become, for most people, dead metaphors. In short, there are many ways in which these habits of speech are thought provoking. In our collective memory there are fascinating lessons about our understanding of nature.</p>
<p><strong>Straight from the horse's mouth</strong><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p>Over the past century the populations of many species that are fixtures of storytelling, like tigers and whales, have been pushed to the brink of extinction by the environmental impact of humans. In general the tide of extinction is rising. This has led me to think about ways that, through art, I can cause people to reflect on their environmental impact. And on the amazing diversity of nature that should be passed on to future generations.</p>
<p><strong>Ants at a picnic</strong><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p>Now, it's obvious that preachy and depressing art is unpopular. So I am employing mental jujitsu to get people to engage with the topic indirectly. In everyday speech there are hundreds of expressions that evoke animal nature. Some of the expressions are accurate and insightful, while others are quite random and misleading. This leads to some interesting philosophical issues about how we know wild creatures. Is it through direct experience? Language? Television?</p>
<p><strong>Cash cow?</strong><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p>The funding target – $1000 – is the bare minimum to accomplish the two publications. The full amount will be consumed by printing costs. Realistically it would be better to have at least $3000, but this funding game dictates that the target be set low to avoid forfeiting 5% of the funds. In any case, the book and calendar will be made. I have learned to make stone soup, or, to put it another way, to ""make a silk purse from a sow's ear.""</p>
<p><strong>Nervous as a cat?</strong><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p>I've been making calendars for over thirty years (a ""coon's age""?). The fact that I haven't missed a year since the 1980s should give you confidence that the calendar is happening! Yours will be printed in color, with high quality paper. The book draws upon the same skills and research. The book printing will be outsourced. Although I have never made a book with more than 40 pages, I have already produced several small publications with the same company, so I am aware of the process and costs involved. Moreover, I'm excited to see the results in print.</p>
<p><strong>Ants in my pants</strong><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p>To be honest, this kind of fundraising makes me a little uncomfortable. That is why it's important to me to offer quality premiums. If you have loads of cash, by all means make a donation. But in general, I'm happy to provide you with unique printed matter.</p>
<p><strong>Free as a bird</strong><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p>So you don't have any extra ""clams""? Don't worry.

<p><strong>""Touch""</strong> is a public art project consisting of an image of two hands performing a gesture of intimate connection, printed on a bus wrap that will circulate for a month in the city of Richmond, Virginia. The importance of this image relies on the persistence of its gesture, counter to the increasingly individualist and threatening times we live in based on a fear and rejection towards “the other”.</p>
<p>Each bus is assigned a different route every day. This enables the image to be disseminated as widely as possible. The bus will run from more lower class neighborhoods such as Blackwell and Broad Rock in the South Side to more upper class areas like The Fan and The Museum District among others.</p>
<p>I aim to communicate directly with a general public by appropriating and altering strategies of a commercial discourse to re-constitute that which belongs to Richmond’s citizens, the streets. I have specially chosen a simple and direct image of human contact reaching for a diverse, heterogeneous and unsuspecting audience. The use of cropping of the image allows for the audience to project themselves in the space of the image; whether it is the hand being touched or the touching hand. I want this transient piece to have passersby experience the unexpected: an image of a human touch. It is an invitation to slow down for a moment and contemplate, about what an image of an affectionate touch means to those passing through.</p>

<p> <strong>""Touch""</strong> es un proyecto de arte público consistente una imagen de dos manos, una posada sobre la otra en un gesto de conexión íntima. Esta imagen circulará impresa en un autobús durante un mes por la ciudad de Richmond, Virginia. La importancia de esta imagen recae en la cualidad de resistencia intrínseca en el gesto, contrario a unos tiempos como los de ahora, cada vez más individualistas y amenazantes basados en el miedo y rechazo hacia ""lo otro"". </p>
<p>La linea de ruta asignada a cada autobús cambia cada día. Esto permite que la imagen se disemine lo máximo posible. El autobús circulará por  las barriadas más marginales como Blackwell y Broad Rock en el sur de la ciudad a zonas más residenciales de clase media-alta como The Fan o The Museum District entre otros. </p>
<p>Pretendo comunicarme directamente con un público general, ajeno a a los circuitos habituales del arte, apropiándome y alterando estrategias de un discurso comercial para re-conquistar aquello que pertenece a los ciudadanos de Richmond, las calles. He elegido concretamente una imagen tan sencilla y directa de contacto humano aspirando a conectar con una audiencia diversa y heterogénea. La forma en que la imagen está recortada y descontextualizada, permite a los viandantes, ciclistas, y conductores, proyectar su propia interpretación sobre ella. Así, uno puede elegir ser la mano tocada o la mano que se posa sobre la primera, en un acto de consuelo. Quiero que esta pieza temporal permita a los transeúntes experimentar lo inesperado: una imagen de contacto humano. Esta pieza de arte público es una invitación para detenerse por un momento y reflexionar sobre qué significa para cada uno encontrarse de manera fortuita con un imagen de un gesto de afecto entre dos personas. </p>

""Touch"" is a public art project consisting of an image of two hands performing a gesture of intimate connection, printed on a bus wrap that will circulate for a month in the city of Richmond, Virginia. The importance of this image relies on the persistence of its gesture, counter to the increasingly individualist and threatening times we live in based on a fear and rejection towards “the other”.
Each bus is assigned a different route every day. This enables the image to be disseminated as widely as possible. The bus will run from more lower class neighborhoods such as Blackwell and Broad Rock in the South Side to more upper class areas like The Fan and The Museum District among others.
I aim to communicate directly with a general public by appropriating and altering strategies of a commercial discourse to re-constitute that which belongs to Richmond’s citizens, the streets. I have specially chosen a simple and direct image of human contact reaching for a diverse, heterogeneous and unsuspecting audience. The use of cropping of the image allows for the audience to project themselves in the space of the image; whether it is the hand being touched or the touching hand. I want this transient piece to have passersby experience the unexpected: an image of a human touch. It is an invitation to slow down for a moment and contemplate, about what an image of an affectionate touch means to those passing through.

 ""Touch"" es un proyecto de arte público consistente una imagen de dos manos, una posada sobre la otra en un gesto de conexión íntima. Esta imagen circulará impresa en un autobús durante un mes por la ciudad de Richmond, Virginia. La importancia de esta imagen recae en la cualidad de resistencia intrínseca en el gesto, contrario a unos tiempos como los de ahora, cada vez más individualistas y amenazantes basados en el miedo y rechazo hacia ""lo otro"". 
La linea de ruta asignada a cada autobús cambia cada día. Esto permite que la imagen se disemine lo máximo posible. El autobús circulará por  las barriadas más marginales como Blackwell y Broad Rock en el sur de la ciudad a zonas más residenciales de clase media-alta como The Fan o The Museum District entre otros. 
Pretendo comunicarme directamente con un público general, ajeno a a los circuitos habituales del arte, apropiándome y alterando estrategias de un discurso comercial para re-conquistar aquello que pertenece a los ciudadanos de Richmond, las calles. He elegido concretamente una imagen tan sencilla y directa de contacto humano aspirando a conectar con una audiencia diversa y heterogénea. La forma en que la imagen está recortada y descontextualizada, permite a los viandantes, ciclistas, y conductores, proyectar su propia interpretación sobre ella. Así, uno puede elegir ser la mano tocada o la mano que se posa sobre la primera, en un acto de consuelo. Quiero que esta pieza temporal permita a los transeúntes experimentar lo inesperado: una imagen de contacto humano. Esta pieza de arte público es una invitación para detenerse por un momento y reflexionar sobre qué significa para cada uno encontrarse de manera fortuita con un imagen de un gesto de afecto entre dos personas.

<p>I have loved paper since I was a small child.  I had a wall with my favorite gift wrap taped to it!  It has been a constant in my life, but I didn't know until 2009 that it was to become my passion and purpose.</p>
<p>In June 2009, I decided to start a stationery company, <a href=""http://www.s2stationery.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">S2 Stationery and Design</a>. I wanted my business to focus on eco-friendly paper and printing techniques. As I designed more and began working with different papers, I realized I not know how the paper I was using was being made. The sources could have been hurting the planet! At the same time, I began to work more and more with hand made papers from around the world, and a light bulb went off - I knew that to truly learn the art and the craftsmanship of real paper making, I would have to go to the source- to the artists directly making paper by hand to learn their traditions and techniques.</p>
<p>I want to learn everything about paper making around the world: from the moment bark, fiber, and other materials are collected to create the pulp that will eventually become sheets of paper, to the flattening and drying processes, to the final way designs for each sheet is determined, and everything in between.</p>
<p>My trip will begin on October 15th when I take the train from Tokyo to Echizen, Japan, on the western side of the country. Echizen has a history rich in making Japanese Washi paper. It has a museum, <a href=""http://www.echizenwashi.jp/english/information/museum.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Echizen Washi Paper and Culture Museum </a>where those interested in paper can stay and study for a few weeks.  I have been in touch with the museum and will be spending around 2, no more than 3, months at the museum working with the artists to learn washi paper making and will teach a few classes at the end of December. I am so excited for this opportunity!</p>
<p>If I can raise the money through this campaign, I will travel from Japan to countries in South East Asia (Thailand, Cambodia, Philippines, Vietnam and Indonesia) learning their paper traditions. Most programs run a week or two in these countries and require travel to each country as well as lodging expenses. Money raised will go directly to travel to each paper making program, lodging, fees and supply costs for each program. Additional money raised than the asking amount will go to helping me stay longer in each country.</p>
<p>All of the reward incentives offered will be done on paper I make during the time spent learning in these various countries. They will all be marked accordingly so you know where that particular art came from.</p>
<p>I will be documenting the experience as often as I can via <a href=""http://s2designs.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">my company blog</a>. I will also be sending out email updates regularly to those who would like to receive them.</p>

My Dad told my sister and me that you don’t have to be rich to be kind, philanthropic, or even indulge in the arts. He told us to be creative, think large, and come up with an idea to meet these aspirations. </p><p>Our entire education teaches us to strive for the top of the class, to get a great job, and make money. Rarely are we taught to be imaginative, passionate, and kind. I come from a background in banking and financial reporting, but I was not inspired by only maximizing profits. I wanted to imagine a new business model – one that aggregates shared resources and provides shared benefits. There are enough resources on this planet, we just have to be creative about how to use them.</p><p>I asked myself: what if we could unlock the value of art – a transformative, virtuous, universal medium – as a vehicle for social good? And do it in such a way that ensures your contribution is making a difference? More importantly, how could someone like you or me experience the joy of knowing that we can make a difference, too?</p><p>With these goals in mind, Art of Kindness was created to unite a family love of art with my strong business acumen and passion for social impact.</p><p>I have spent the past two years researching and developing the ideas behind Art of Kindness by working with partners, artists, collectors and industry experts to validate our mission. I even focused my graduate thesis at Imperial College Business School on Art of Kindness. In December of last year, Imperial College sponsored me for a UK entrepreneurial visa, providing further affirmation for the business.</p><p> </p><h3>WHY WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT- OUR FIRST EXHIBITION</h3><p>The Art of Kindness exhibition will showcase our mission through a new and exciting digital art experience. The unique interactive exhibition will broadcast art, its patronage, and the potential for social good. This transformative experience will be centred on showcasing digital mediums to portray the connection between the human phenomena of kindness and art as a new language for human possibility.</p><p>London based architecture firm <a href=""http://www.tonkinliu.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tonkin Liu</a> is custom designing a unique installation to help us take viewers on this new journey, designing it for future use and integrating the philosophy behind our organization into the concept.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495817776/kepzvyyz5v63wycrbnbq.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>This pop-up exhibition is the first step towards our long-term goal of integrating technology into the Art of Kindness platform, which allows us to portray this new narrative in a more impactful, tangible, and unique way.</p><p>Here the art will be for sale, which allows us to give a percentage directly to our social impact partner organizations. We will also display the pieces of art that have already been sold and start to reveal the impact these funds have had on the social project being supported.</p><p>This is the intention behind our business and the focus of our first exhibition. We want to showcase the future possibilities of the next chapter of art’s story, while also celebrating the previous ones, creating a new art journey and kindness experience.</p><p>The exhibition will explore three areas:</p><ul>
<li>Primarily, we will explore what attracts us to art and how we can capture those sentiments in a unique digital experience.</li>
<li>Second, we will define what kindness means to us. How does it manifest in art? In nature? In our communities? In our consciousness?</li>
<li>Finally, we will test our goal of celebrating the human phenomena of kindness and imprinting this into our consciousness through digital and smart technologies.</li>
</ul><h3> </h3><h3>WHAT EXACTLY WE NEED FROM YOU</h3><p>Corporations or institutions traditionally sponsor art exhibitions. Since Art of Kindness is building a community, we want to give art lovers and philanthropists the opportunity to join us and participate in this experience.</p><p>We’re asking you to help us raise £45,000 (the equivalent of $57,000) for the five day, pop-up exhibition.</p><h3> </h3><h3>HOW WE WILL USE THE FUNDS</h3><p>£45,000 will fund the hard costs of the exhibition needed to get this off the ground. This includes: covering the costs associated with renting the exhibition space, setting up the digital build out to support our unique experience, and producing the custom designed installation from the talented team at London Tonkin Liu.

Over the centuries, some pieces of art have accumulated exorbitant value simply by being in the hands of a historic figure. The great artists of history did not envisage their work resonating with others in the centuries to come. Their work merely reflected the environmental and socio-economic climate of the time in a way that had meaning to future generations. The starving artist, Vincent Van Gogh, would never have predicted his ‘Portrait of Dr. Gatchet’ would sell for $82.5 million in 1990.  The value of a piece of art is determined by its story – its origin, history, the artist’s intentions, and the perception and tastes of others.</p><p>Art of Kindness will not only leverage the intangible qualities and financial value of art to help fund social initiatives all over the world, we will also write a new chapter in the story of the art piece.</p><p>Through Art of Kindness, we are adding social layer to the artwork. A story that is current, but celebrates its history and alludes to its future. This allows you to view the art piece in a completely different way – one that now includes you and the benefit this piece of art has catalyzed.</p><p> </p><h3>TIMELINE<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496045726/zw5zydrxomrdwfqvcnnc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>

My Dad told my sister and me that you don’t have to be rich to be kind, philanthropic, or even indulge in the arts. He told us to be creative, think large, and come up with an idea to meet these aspirations. Our entire education teaches us to strive for the top of the class, to get a great job, and make money. Rarely are we taught to be imaginative, passionate, and kind. I come from a background in banking and financial reporting, but I was not inspired by only maximizing profits. I wanted to imagine a new business model – one that aggregates shared resources and provides shared benefits. There are enough resources on this planet, we just have to be creative about how to use them.I asked myself: what if we could unlock the value of art – a transformative, virtuous, universal medium – as a vehicle for social good? And do it in such a way that ensures your contribution is making a difference? More importantly, how could someone like you or me experience the joy of knowing that we can make a difference, too?With these goals in mind, Art of Kindness was created to unite a family love of art with my strong business acumen and passion for social impact.I have spent the past two years researching and developing the ideas behind Art of Kindness by working with partners, artists, collectors and industry experts to validate our mission. I even focused my graduate thesis at Imperial College Business School on Art of Kindness. In December of last year, Imperial College sponsored me for a UK entrepreneurial visa, providing further affirmation for the business. WHY WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT- OUR FIRST EXHIBITIONThe Art of Kindness exhibition will showcase our mission through a new and exciting digital art experience. The unique interactive exhibition will broadcast art, its patronage, and the potential for social good. This transformative experience will be centred on showcasing digital mediums to portray the connection between the human phenomena of kindness and art as a new language for human possibility.London based architecture firm Tonkin Liu is custom designing a unique installation to help us take viewers on this new journey, designing it for future use and integrating the philosophy behind our organization into the concept.This pop-up exhibition is the first step towards our long-term goal of integrating technology into the Art of Kindness platform, which allows us to portray this new narrative in a more impactful, tangible, and unique way.Here the art will be for sale, which allows us to give a percentage directly to our social impact partner organizations. We will also display the pieces of art that have already been sold and start to reveal the impact these funds have had on the social project being supported.This is the intention behind our business and the focus of our first exhibition. We want to showcase the future possibilities of the next chapter of art’s story, while also celebrating the previous ones, creating a new art journey and kindness experience.The exhibition will explore three areas:
Primarily, we will explore what attracts us to art and how we can capture those sentiments in a unique digital experience.
Second, we will define what kindness means to us. How does it manifest in art? In nature? In our communities? In our consciousness?
Finally, we will test our goal of celebrating the human phenomena of kindness and imprinting this into our consciousness through digital and smart technologies.
 WHAT EXACTLY WE NEED FROM YOUCorporations or institutions traditionally sponsor art exhibitions. Since Art of Kindness is building a community, we want to give art lovers and philanthropists the opportunity to join us and participate in this experience.We’re asking you to help us raise £45,000 (the equivalent of $57,000) for the five day, pop-up exhibition. HOW WE WILL USE THE FUNDS£45,000 will fund the hard costs of the exhibition needed to get this off the ground. This includes: covering the costs associated with renting the exhibition space, setting up the digital build out to support our unique experience, and producing the custom designed installation from the talented team at London Tonkin Liu. This also includes bringing some of the artists to London for the exhibition.Your contribution will go directly to the exhibition and our digital build out which further amplifies the experience with our partners, artists, collectors and the crowd. WHAT IS ART OF KINDNESS?Art of Kindness celebrates the most vital aspect of the human spirit: kindness.Our platform enables you to:1. SELECT AND PURCHASE YOUR ARTWORK         Our artists have exhibited all over the world, are renowned in their field, and personally advocate for social causes. They produce work across multiple mediums including painting, sculpture, photography and mixed media. They hail from all over the world: from New Zealand and India to the UK, Portugal and the US. Meet some of our artists:Petroc SestiPetroc Sesti is a London-based artist born in 1973, whose work is exhibited in museums and permanent collections around the world. He works in a variety of mediums exploring concepts of physics, cosmology and matter.Rita GTRita GT lives between Luanda, Angola and Viana do Castelo, Portugal.

He is credited with easternizing the Color Field language through his use of thrown and sifted pigment.Nathan Slate Joseph An integral member of the New York School of Art for more than forty years, he blurs the boundary between painting and sculpture. Alluding to issues of globalization, immigration and climate change, he collects shards of discarded steel and stains them with raw pigment and acid.Seema KohliCelebrated Indian artist and visual storyteller whose work spans over three decades. Her paintings, drawings, and public murals are an extension of her creative growth and search for self.Revati Sharma SinghInternational contemporary artist who uses her art to showcase the issues that face Indian society.

PICK A CAUSE YOU LOVE AND SEE THE IMPACT CREATEDwww.acumen.orgwww.elephant-family.orgwww.charitywater.orgwww.project-pressure.orgwww.micrograam.comEach of our partners has a proven ability to deliver on their promise of building a better world in a very transparent and engaging way. Like Art of Kindness, storytelling is built into their mission.3. CELEBRATE AND SHARE WITH OTHERS (in the future on the AoK app) 4. BUILD YOUR LEGACY OF KINDNESS (in the future on www.artofkindness.co.uk platform)Art of Kindness is a new and exciting marketplace for art, where artists and collectors can discover, exhibit, buy, and sell art while giving to a cause they love. A portion of the proceeds from each sale is given to one of our social impact partners from all over the world. We share the same proceeds from the sale of the artwork that would ordinarily be ""fees"" in the traditional art market.Through your involvement and vibrant storytelling, Art of Kindness creates a new story for all art lovers and philanthropists – which includes you, the artist or collector, the artwork, and the champion for social good. We will curate a new narrative for the art piece, as a unique Art of Kindness experience, for you to share on our platform.We believe that art can be more than just a beautiful object that hangs on a wall – it can be part of your of legacy of kindness to make our world a more beautiful place – one artwork at a time. We invite you to build your social giving legacy with us. What do you want your story to be? VISIONOur aim is to provide easy and transparent access to the art market, with the opportunity to do social good through art. We are creating a unique experience for people who may feel locked out of the marketplace or unsure of how they can get involved in giving back.We will share the new stories where art lives – in both the virtual universe and through curated physical pop-up exhibitions.Some key elements of our work are still under wraps, and we look forward to unveiling more of our vision in the months ahead. We hope to see you at our exhibition this fall in London where you can witness our work come alive, expressed through our artists, patrons, partners and the art loving crowd. A NEW 'ART OF KINDNESS' CHAPTER IN A PIECE OF ART’S STORYA piece of art’s value largely determined by its story.A vast majority of the world’s art resides in a collector's home, on the walls of great institutions and museums or locked away in vaults, hidden from the rest of the world. Over the centuries, some pieces of art have accumulated exorbitant value simply by being in the hands of a historic figure. The great artists of history did not envisage their work resonating with others in the centuries to come. Their work merely reflected the environmental and socio-economic climate of the time in a way that had meaning to future generations. The starving artist, Vincent Van Gogh, would never have predicted his ‘Portrait of Dr. Gatchet’ would sell for $82.5 million in 1990.  The value of a piece of art is determined by its story – its origin, history, the artist’s intentions, and the perception and tastes of others.Art of Kindness will not only leverage the intangible qualities and financial value of art to help fund social initiatives all over the world, we will also write a new chapter in the story of the art piece.Through Art of Kindness, we are adding social layer to the artwork. A story that is current, but celebrates its history and alludes to its future. This allows you to view the art piece in a completely different way – one that now includes you and the benefit this piece of art has catalyzed. TIMELINE
 WHAT ARE THE RISKS AND CHALLENGES?We are confident that this campaign will help us to showcase our exhibition. As we are a start-up, we have faced many challenges along the way, and it is inevitable that we will face more in the months ahead. However, we will continue to work through any roadblocks with perseverance, tenacity and dedication.In the event that there are delays that significantly impact our schedule, we promise to communicate with full transparency. Our team is passionate about this initiative and is fully committed to managing the obstacles we might face along this journey in writing the next chapter of art’s story.   END NOTEWe understand that not everyone can give financially, so support in any form helps!

My name is Emma Lu and since the end of 2012 I have found myself creating art, and lots of it! </span><br/></p><p>See, I didn't grow up in the nicest city, nor was my early education very good. Any belief in my creativity was gone by the time I found myself alone in the world. I lost my parents a few years apart from each other, an age when I was about to move into adulthood. I entered my 20's an orphan and up until my art, life was a struggle in some way, emotional or finding myself homeless for many years. </p><p>I had nobody in the world to care about or to worry about me. But through grief a freedom was granted me, however hard it was to attain. I found myself a nomad, moving from hotel job to hotel job, anywhere they offered me a roof and food and small wage. I got to see some amazing places and meet some inspirational characters and although only 27 already have a few books to write about my journey so far. </p><p>But honestly it was lonely, I never faced my grief because our culture is so scared of death and treats it like a taboo instead of a natural process. I finally wanted to just live a life again like I had before it was interrupted. I wanted to put to rest the grief and stitch up that scar. So I found myself in the Amazon Jungle drinking an alternative shamanic medicine to western science.</p><p> Ayahuasca. It has been the most life changing process and a very positive one. Its a medicine and it was my last resort and the scariest step I ever took. I entered that experience not knowing what would come from it, just maybe a life I could live in again, but instead I left an artist. Suddenly my days were filled with drawings, then paintings. And it has not stopped or slowed down since. </p><p>I'm not a scientist but I do feel I am proof to anybody who thinks this is just a trippy drug, that it is in fact exactly what the people who have been using in their culture say it is, medicine. As soon as I left the jungle 21/12/2012 I created a Facebook art page and ever since have been uploading my progress, art and journey with amazing feedback from all over the world.</p><p>I see the art I create is popular among people from all walks of life. Its self taught, its not been shaped by art school, and its hardly ever planned and it wont stop. I have done a lot of online networking with the world getting it out there. But now I need to go with it, because my art is my story. I don't put it all out there for sympathy (I don't need that). I put it out there because I know when I was at rock bottom I could have done with some Psychedelic Artist telling me <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">""look it will be OK"" </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">through words or through their art. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I need help with this, I buy canvas over food </span>some days<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> :) </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The basic outline of this trip is to start in Amsterdam. Most of the trip will be hard work and taking my art to places I feel would </span>benefit<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> from it, and as I am a Psychedelic Artist I would like to spend just a week or so networking Amsterdam </span>Coffee shops<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> with my artwork in person. From this part of the trip I hope to just get myself out there, maybe get some mural work and so forth.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">From here I will go to Jerusalem. I have spent a lot of time in both Israel and Palestine and know a lot about this conflict. I spent a lot of time around the more </span>war-torn<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> regions and was completely blown away with the graffiti. I would like to spend a short amount of time in the area working on some graffiti with the message of peace, but in my own psychedelic way and something very different, even taboo for such a religious place (if in Jerusalem), but positive either way. I already have contacts there and places to stay and I plan to make good use of them with my art in person. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">From here I wish to visit Egypt. Since the revolution their has been an artistic explosion in the country and I also want to work more with political peaceful graffiti. I also want to network with one of my </span>favorite<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> authors and get some knowledge that will add to the depth of my artwork. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Next stop is the USA. I am currently looking for locations to spend longer periods of time, networking and getting inspired. First I would start in New York, over the years on my travels I met many artistic friends from here and would love to get my artwork here as well as visiting Alex Grey's Chapel of Sacred Mirrors.</span></p><p>Then I will slowly make my way west. Colorado for around a month then California where I want to spend the most time with my art. It is mainly people from California who have been showing a lot of interest in my artwork since the early days so reaching here will be a very important step for my art and myself. I will work my arse of networking, displaying, graffiti, festivals, everything! And I will put more information on the places and  faces I am aiming for soon. :)</p><p>The final part of my journey is Mexico. This country has been calling me for years, I even dedicated my right arm to a big Mexican tattoo. I met some political graffiti artists from Mexico that I am still in touch with and would love a chance to see their art in action and join in. I also met another artist who has projects teaching kids art, which I would love to do. </p><p>And that's all for now :) </p><p>During the entire time at every chance I get, I will try and get as many people I can making art. Its good for you and you don't need an art degree to create art, we all have it in us, just like we all can learn to play an instrument if we try. I believe in areas where there is not much going on for the youth, or a lot of horrible stuff going on for the youth, the more psychedelic bright happy art the better. Art helps people dream, tunes up the imagination, makes people calm and can be a healthier escape option than other things. Since as young as I can remember that's all I wanted for the world but I had no idea how to do it. I'm going to give it a go with my art, dream big :) </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get </h3><h3><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-weight: normal;"">So I pretty much have to go for days without food currently, its impossible for me to save any money. I have rent and my wage is below minimum as well as it being winter and not much work around....</span></h3><p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-weight: normal;"">I need help with this Please: </span></p><p><br/></p><ul><li>Flights and Travel. UK - Amsterdam - Israel/Palestine -Egypt -USA -Mexico. This is what a lot of the money raised will be going on, I'm confident I can make a bit with my art along the way and I will sofa surf and volunteer for accommodation. I will try and do the transport costs for £2500 max but it may go over that target. </li></ul><ul><li>The rest of the money will go on food, basic needs, emergencies, living and my art supply as I will have to get new stuff in each different country. I'm used to being broke, I can make money last a long time. </li></ul><ul><li>If I don't reach my final goal the money will still go towards this trip, that will not change. Its happening somehow! And if I only raise maybe a few hundred pounds it will be the first savings towards this trip, and some desperately needed art supplies. </li></ul><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>The impact from my trip is not just a personal goal I am aiming to reach, its larger than myself. I'm not a fan of the people who run things, but I am a fan of the underdog. I am that underdog and my art is proving already that dreams are possible no matter who you are or where you come from. The door is open and i'm partly through, I just need to jump, no fear, and really believe I can bring positive vibrations into this world with my art. Whats the point of happiness if you don't have the world to share it with? </p><p>And if my most magical dreams come true and this art thing can turn into a living I hope to inspire others to KNOW you are everything you already need to be. Its all inside, with dedicated you can get there.</p><p>My story/art will also highlight the corruption within the War On Drugs and how some legal drugs are a lot more dangerous than illegal ones. I saw my parents face death, my mother unready and completely destroyed from her cancer treatment that took away her quality of life. We all die, stop fighting it and just go with it. I learnt from death how to live, my art is life. Thank you for your time. </p><p>I'm a good trustworthy person, can get reference for that claim :)</p><p>Love.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Spread the art &lt;3 <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Emma-Lu-Arts/435914796477708"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Emma-Lu-Arts/435914796477708</a></p></div>","SummaryHello world.

First I would start in New York, over the years on my travels I met many artistic friends from here and would love to get my artwork here as well as visiting Alex Grey's Chapel of Sacred Mirrors.Then I will slowly make my way west. Colorado for around a month then California where I want to spend the most time with my art. It is mainly people from California who have been showing a lot of interest in my artwork since the early days so reaching here will be a very important step for my art and myself. I will work my arse of networking, displaying, graffiti, festivals, everything! And I will put more information on the places and  faces I am aiming for soon. :)The final part of my journey is Mexico. This country has been calling me for years, I even dedicated my right arm to a big Mexican tattoo. I met some political graffiti artists from Mexico that I am still in touch with and would love a chance to see their art in action and join in. I also met another artist who has projects teaching kids art, which I would love to do. And that's all for now :) During the entire time at every chance I get, I will try and get as many people I can making art. Its good for you and you don't need an art degree to create art, we all have it in us, just like we all can learn to play an instrument if we try. I believe in areas where there is not much going on for the youth, or a lot of horrible stuff going on for the youth, the more psychedelic bright happy art the better. Art helps people dream, tunes up the imagination, makes people calm and can be a healthier escape option than other things. Since as young as I can remember that's all I wanted for the world but I had no idea how to do it. I'm going to give it a go with my art, dream big :) What We Need & What You Get So I pretty much have to go for days without food currently, its impossible for me to save any money. I have rent and my wage is below minimum as well as it being winter and not much work around....I need help with this Please: Flights and Travel. UK - Amsterdam - Israel/Palestine -Egypt -USA -Mexico. This is what a lot of the money raised will be going on, I'm confident I can make a bit with my art along the way and I will sofa surf and volunteer for accommodation. I will try and do the transport costs for £2500 max but it may go over that target. The rest of the money will go on food, basic needs, emergencies, living and my art supply as I will have to get new stuff in each different country. I'm used to being broke, I can make money last a long time. If I don't reach my final goal the money will still go towards this trip, that will not change. Its happening somehow! And if I only raise maybe a few hundred pounds it will be the first savings towards this trip, and some desperately needed art supplies. The ImpactThe impact from my trip is not just a personal goal I am aiming to reach, its larger than myself. I'm not a fan of the people who run things, but I am a fan of the underdog. I am that underdog and my art is proving already that dreams are possible no matter who you are or where you come from. The door is open and i'm partly through, I just need to jump, no fear, and really believe I can bring positive vibrations into this world with my art. Whats the point of happiness if you don't have the world to share it with? And if my most magical dreams come true and this art thing can turn into a living I hope to inspire others to KNOW you are everything you already need to be. Its all inside, with dedicated you can get there.My story/art will also highlight the corruption within the War On Drugs and how some legal drugs are a lot more dangerous than illegal ones. I saw my parents face death, my mother unready and completely destroyed from her cancer treatment that took away her quality of life. We all die, stop fighting it and just go with it. I learnt from death how to live, my art is life. Thank you for your time. I'm a good trustworthy person, can get reference for that claim :)Love.Other Ways You Can HelpSpread the art <3 https://www.facebook.com/pages/Emma-Lu-Arts/435914796477708",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I'm Molly, the writer/director of this film. Me and my DOP Dave got together earlier this year and talked about how much we'd like to make this short, but what a shame that we couldn't because we didn't have the budget. Then we realised that actually maybe we could... by pulling in favours, by giving people the opportunity to gain credits, by selling our possessions and by being cheeky enough to ask you. So that's why I'm here, talking to you now. Hi. (Your hair looks great, btw). </p>
<p>In these dark times, it feels good to laugh as well as cry and shout and get drunk and try to be better people. This is a film that will make you laugh as well as hopefully make you think, feel all the feelings and contemplate YOUR WHOLE PURPOSE IN LIFE. Or, you might at least smile and think, aww, bless them for having a go. </p>
<p>This is a film about love and hope and family and people who talk too much. It's about a narcissistic comedian who's about to learn a massively important lesson, via a trip to a grim seaside town and an unexpected game of Dungeons and Dragons. </p>
<p>Due to what I can only describe as witchcraft, I have somehow managed to bag an amazing cast consisting of the wonderful Paul Foxcroft, Sara Pascoe, Marcus Brigstocke and Charlotte Gittins. I have also cast some YOUNG PEOPLE - Martha, Louis and Jeremiah . I'm excited to give them an opportunity to do their first bit of film acting. Our co-lead is Cybil Cann, who is 14 and has the most excellent personality as well as genuinely mesmerising eyes. I need to stop telling her that though, apparently it's ""creepy"". (She does, though, and if you help fund this film you can see them for yourself. Then we'll see who's ""being weird"").  </p>
<p>Oh, you have some questions? Cool.</p>
<p><strong>YOU: So Molly. Why should I contribute to this? </strong></p>
<p>ME: Good question. Also nice jumper. Well, it will be a really good film, hopefully. Also it will help me and Dave with our lives. He wants to get more experience as a DOP, I want to be a director. We realised that no one was going to help us gain those skills, we needed to do it ourselves! By which I mean, ask you. But most of all, it's going to be a really good film. </p>
<p><strong>YOU: Sounds good, if incredibly indulgent. But how do I know for sure that it's going to be decent? I don't want to throw my money at garbage. </strong></p>
<p>ME: Gosh no, nobody wants that. Well, what can I say. I have written some stuff already, for BBC Radio 4, for Sky One, and for a whole bunch of theatres, and other places. Dave is a renowned photographer and has made films before, too. This is not amateur-hour. We are very committed to making it good, and I refer you back to the excellent cast list to further convince you of the potential quality.</p>
<p><strong>YOU: And what will you do with it once it is made?</strong></p>
<p>ME: We will submit it to a bunch of festivals and see if it gets anywhere. Through this experience and the things we get to learn (inevitably due to our mistakes), we will have all learned how to make a filmmaking and will be able to continue to make work with the help of having this on our respective CVs. And YOU will have a lovely film to watch, and the knowledge that you did a Bloody Good Deed. If you have even read this far, I'm extremely grateful! If you can't chuck us any quids right now, sharing or sending to someone else is also very helpful. </p>
<p>Here are some pictures of us rehearsing and location scouting to show you how into it we all are, even when it's windy. </p>

Violet begins to track down the men who have hurt her, determined not to be a compliant victim anymore, and take matters into  her own hands. During her blood-soaked journey, she meets a boy named Josh at the one place she gets solace - her favorite lake. Will Josh give her the closure she needs or will revenge be the only way for her to heal?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566426273/fzeiwgdogvxgowickxok.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>                                   Teaser Poster for Violet - Artwork by 'Martin Trafford'</p><p> </p><p>                       </p><h3><strong>Why Crowdfunding?</strong></h3><p>Why Crowdfunding?

Me and my cast/crew would love to finish the film over a weekend in October and we need your help! The goal is only 3000 but that will help cover costs on set with actors, sound, etc. But that will also cover post production costs to cover the score (composed by Justin Burning) AND get the poster artwork commissioned (artwork by Simon Pritchard). WHATEVER is funded after the goal will help me get rid of the debt I have aquired from doing this project and if somehow I'm able to raise even more than that - every penny will go towards my next feature film 'Scarlett'. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Now, let's get to the good stuff!</strong></p><h3><strong>The Cast of VIOLET</strong></h3><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566426441/obemdquu1nm65ole1xli.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>                                                                Screen grab from 'Violet'</p><p> </p><p>Before working with <strong>Alyss Winkler</strong> (Plank Face, Space Babes from Outer Space) on my previous short film 'Breathe', I had no plans on doing Violet. I wanted to wait and be confident enough in myself, and wanted to find someone who can do this role. Because getting in Violet's head is such a dark place to go to and I had no idea who could do this role and could do it justice... then I worked with Alyss. Halfway through shooting my short film, I was a bit mad at myself. I was like 'why am I doing this, when I can do Violet?' I knew I was ready that moment and I knew I could tackle something much larger than that simple short. The short primarily was a test short, to see if I was even ready for a bigger project. And... pretty much after working with Alyss, I could only see her doing this role.

He is such a down to earth guy and is such a blast to work with. Interesting enough, Jason has also been following my film-making journey since the start.

It's a story that means a lot to me and will hopefully have a positive impact in the community. It is a dark movie, it does deal with a lot of heavy touchy subjects, mostly showcasing the lingering trauma from the attack, but that's the point. Reality is scary and most people try and ignore that, but this film opens your closed eyelids wide open and shows you what people are truly capable of. When I say open your eyes, the film doesn't include a twenty minute rape scene like a lot of 'rape/revenge' movies do. This film starts AFTER the event and we focus on the character more than the lead up and the event itself. When we do show some footage from it, I made sure not to show any nudity. I didn't want to turn anyone on while watching this, I wanted to make you the audience feel disgusted. Because that's what rape is. It's disgusting... and it's fucked up that people just brush it off like it's just 'sex'........<strong> no, it can completely change a person and fuck them up for LIFE... it's not just 'sex'.</strong></p><p> </p><h3>Why should YOU donate to this campaign?</h3><p> </p><p>My first feature film Violet is <strong>85 percent shot</strong>. This film at the end of the day will be finished and delivered to your doorstep soon. This is not a campaign in pre-production, this is also not a campaign that will screw you over. I haven't been in the independent scene that long and I don't know how good my word is... but I've seen people get screwed over with Kickstarter and Indiegogo campaigns... trust me, I've been in those situations too. Actually still waiting for a few of those campaigns to either refund me or send me something haha. So I get it. But this campaign WILL NOT be like that. I have only done three Indiegogo campaigns in the past, but with each of those I made sure to ship as soon as possible and make sure everyone got their perks safe and sound. I love independent film community with all my heart and I want to see it continue to flourish and grow. </p><p>ALSO keep in mind that the perks could ship earlier than 'March 2020'. I only put March down just in case if the score was taking a while or the artwork or whatever. I hope to have everything finished before the end of the year - but if it does go any longer it will not surpass March of 2020... that I can assure you.</p><p> </p><h3>Stretch Goal Information</h3><p> </p><p>IF I'm able to surpass my goal and reach a crazy number I never was able to believe, like I don't even know If I'll raise 3000, but If I do - I have stretch goals in mind that are reallllllly cool extra goodies. I really wanted to use this Kickstarter to raise funds my next feature, but now I have to use it to finish the movie / pay off debt... but if I'm able to raise more to pay off debt / finish the movie, all of the extra funds go straight into my next feature film 'Scarlett' &lt;3 </p><p> </p><h3>Closing Information</h3><p> </p><p>This is my first feature film. This film means the world to me. With every film, short or feature, I have done more than simply make a film. I've poured my soul into these scripts. Pieces of myself are scattered within these stories. Making films isn't just about making them, it's more than that to me. It's about telling a meaningful story.

Me and my amazing cast / crew have shot 85 percent of the movie! As I am typing this we only have another day of filming left to go to completely wrap principal photography!  NOW, let's proceed to what VIOLET is about now shall we? The Story of VIOLETMoments after being brutally violated, a once starry eyed girl named Violet wonders through the night traumatized and completely changed. Violet begins to track down the men who have hurt her, determined not to be a compliant victim anymore, and take matters into  her own hands. During her blood-soaked journey, she meets a boy named Josh at the one place she gets solace - her favorite lake. Will Josh give her the closure she needs or will revenge be the only way for her to heal?                                     Teaser Poster for Violet - Artwork by 'Martin Trafford'                        Why Crowdfunding?Why Crowdfunding? Well that's simple! It's because I'm broke. I can't afford to go into anymore debt from this project and I have bills of my own coming up soon, you know...life... this is where crowdfunding comes in. Me and my cast/crew would love to finish the film over a weekend in October and we need your help! The goal is only 3000 but that will help cover costs on set with actors, sound, etc. But that will also cover post production costs to cover the score (composed by Justin Burning) AND get the poster artwork commissioned (artwork by Simon Pritchard). WHATEVER is funded after the goal will help me get rid of the debt I have aquired from doing this project and if somehow I'm able to raise even more than that - every penny will go towards my next feature film 'Scarlett'.  Now, let's get to the good stuff!The Cast of VIOLET                                                                 Screen grab from 'Violet' Before working with Alyss Winkler (Plank Face, Space Babes from Outer Space) on my previous short film 'Breathe', I had no plans on doing Violet. I wanted to wait and be confident enough in myself, and wanted to find someone who can do this role. Because getting in Violet's head is such a dark place to go to and I had no idea who could do this role and could do it justice... then I worked with Alyss. Halfway through shooting my short film, I was a bit mad at myself. I was like 'why am I doing this, when I can do Violet?' I knew I was ready that moment and I knew I could tackle something much larger than that simple short. The short primarily was a test short, to see if I was even ready for a bigger project. And... pretty much after working with Alyss, I could only see her doing this role. She IS Violet.  One of my favorite reviews of Breathe is linked down below :)https://www.pophorror.com/samuel-vainisis-2018-...                                                                  Screen grab from 'Violet' I've always been a fan of Jason Crowe (Harvest Lake, The Bad Man). He is actually my favorite indie actor to date... I've said this publicly before, but I'm going to say it again. Jason is just one of those rare guys who is amazing on and off set. He is such a down to earth guy and is such a blast to work with. Interesting enough, Jason has also been following my film-making journey since the start. He backed my first ever short Senses and he has been watching me grow over the short years. I was going to ask if he'd be interested in doing a short film... but then I met Alyss and well... the rest is history now.                                                                    Screen grab from 'Violet' Ember Burns is such a great actress and such a funny individual on and off set. Ember is mostly a model but does film work here and there and honestly she needs more credit than she is given. I'm excited to eventually release this film to show people what she can really do.                                                                      Screen grab from 'Violet' Justin Tsanta... this guy was actually my very first producer. He believed in me since the beginning with my short film Senses and he has been by my side ever since. He also is a sick tattoo artist and artist in general. He also did the DVD cover art for my second short film 'Akrasia'. It was a pleasure having him on set, this was actually the first time we ever met in person and we just clicked and starting shooting scenes :)                                                              Screen grab from 'Violet' Brian Papandrea (Space Babes from Outer Space, The Big F) is mostly known for his comedic roles, but in this film he plays a more serious and quite frankly terrifying role in Violet. He absolutely killed it... I've never seen this side of Brian before and it just chilled me to the core (in a good way). He took what I wrote and made it ten time better. I was actually nervous about his scenes, those scenes in general were the scenes I was the most nervous about, but it turned out to be my favorite scenes to shoot AND favorite sequence in the entire movie! Brian is such a committed actor, he is willing to put himself out there and try new things and really give it his all with every role.                                                                Screen grab from 'Violet' Jennie Osterman is a bit newer to acting, but man did she deliver in this film. She is such a sweet heart on and off of set, I don't know where she gets all those positive vibes but can I please steal them? Jennie was able to dip her toes in a role with this film and she even told me she wants to do even more of them and she should! With even more practicing and just being in front of a camera, I see Jennie going places in the independent scene <3                                                                   Screen grab from 'Violet' Keith Voigt Jr. actually was the first person I met in person from the independent scene. I went to my very first horror convention with my copy of Redsin Tower in my backpack. I wanted to meet Fred Vogel to get it signed and also a few other people I wanted to meet from the Indie scene. Back then in 2015, I was just getting really into the scene and I tried to support as many independent artists as I could. And with this con, I also went to meet Marcus Koch and Stephen Biro in person! But Keith stood out... It started out as a usual conversation does when you go to cons. Someone tries to get your attention to possibly buy some dvd's, but then I pulled out my own copy and showed I was a fan and things changed. It was like we were friends right then and there. When I was getting my stuff to leave the con, Keith actually found me and gave me a copy of his short films for free. I still have that DVD and whenever I look at it, I always remember that awesome day and how great of a guy he was. -- story time over... Keith also kills it in this movie. He plays a creep pretty much and I couldn't be more happier.   Martin Trafford has been my main go to artist for the past two years now. I love this man and everything he has done for me. He has done artwork for my novel 'Unlocking The Truth', illustrations for my novella 'Agony & Pleasure',  DVD art for Senses, Akrasia and Breathe and COUNTLESS other pieces. This guy is a legend in the indie scene and a true friend. He also has a small cameo in Violet as Jason (over the phone because he is from Australia).  I met Samuel Thompson on the set of 'The Bad Man' and he amazed me right from the start. He also taught me all the basics of film-making on set. That film set was my very first time being apart of a crew and actually creating something. I had no idea what to do going into it, but after the experience only a few weeks later I began doing my own shorts. But that is going into my own story... anyways back to Sam. I was pretty amazed by how much knowledge Sam had with sound and all the little things that go into it. I was even more captivated with him once I saw the first trailer for the film drop, the sound was crystal clear and just perfect in every way. Right then and there I knew I had to contact him about recording sound for one of my films down the line... and a year and a half later it happened :)  I am so thrilled that Justin Burning is the composer for Violet! He scored the teaser trailer for the film, to give you an idea of how amazing he is. I honestly had no idea of Justin until I heard his music in 'The Bad Man', and I was just floored. He is one of the best in the indie scene to date and from what I heard from Scott Schirmer, the director of 'The Bad Man', he is a pleasure to work. Honestly, this film wouldn't be as good without him and I am so thrilled to have him on board!  Simon Pritchard will be the artist that is going to design the DVD / Poster art. Back earlier in the year, I saw previous work he did on another indie film titled 'Chickens Blood' and I was amazed by the quality of the piece. I also found out he hand paints the pieces and I'm not going to lie I stalked his facebook hahah. I looked through all of his photos and looked at the paintings he did that he commissioned and ones he just did to do and right then and there I contacted him and asked him if he'd be interested in doing a piece for me... and I haven't changed my mind since. This guy is seriously amazing and I cannot wait to see what he designs for the film.                                                      Behind The Scenes Photo of 'Violet'  HERE ARE THE PERKS THAT INCLUDE PHOTOS (MOSTLY PROP SECTION)                                                                       'Akrasia' Wardrobe Screen grab from 'Akrasia' Senses, Akrasia and Breathe (from left to right) Josh's Grey Hoodie from 'Violet' Pink Wig from 'Violet' SCREEN WORN RIPPED UP GREEN FLANNEL AND WOODEN POCKET KNIFE FROM 'VIOLET' DRESS LIKE VIOLET! - BLACK HOODIE, RED BEANIE AND POCKET KNIFE FROM 'VIOLET' Violet's Backpack and Notebook Ski Mask from 'Violet' HARVEST LAKE TENTACLE #1 HARVEST LAKE TENTACLE #2 BLOODY OUTFIT #1 BLOODY OUTFIT #2 BLOODY BANDAGES FROM 'VIOLET' - INCLUDED WITH THE BLOODY OUTFIT #2 PERK GUN PROP FROM 'VIOLET' RED WOODS PAINTING FROM VIOLET'S BEDROOM ORIGINAL ARTWORK FROM 'SENSES'  BY 'JOE MEREDITH' SCRIPT OF 'VIOLET' (needs more autographs) UNDER THE MOON PAINTING FROM VIOLET'S BEDROOM (by Brittany Blanton) I WAIT BEYOND THE TREES PAINTING FROM VIOLET'S BEDROOM (by Brittany Blanton) UNDER THE SKIN PAINTING FROM VIOLET'S BEDROOM (by Brittany Blanton) SERPENTS MEDUSA - MAIN PAINTING FROM VIOLET'S BEDROOM (by Adam Mickey McAndrew's and Alyss Winkler) CHEST PIECE #1 FROM 'VIOLET' LAPTOP PROP FROM 'VIOLET' (works perfect too)  NEW PERK ADDED! MARTIN TRAFFORD DESIGNED THESE PORTRAITS BELOW.

It is a dark movie, it does deal with a lot of heavy touchy subjects, mostly showcasing the lingering trauma from the attack, but that's the point. Reality is scary and most people try and ignore that, but this film opens your closed eyelids wide open and shows you what people are truly capable of. When I say open your eyes, the film doesn't include a twenty minute rape scene like a lot of 'rape/revenge' movies do. This film starts AFTER the event and we focus on the character more than the lead up and the event itself. When we do show some footage from it, I made sure not to show any nudity. I didn't want to turn anyone on while watching this, I wanted to make you the audience feel disgusted. Because that's what rape is. It's disgusting... and it's fucked up that people just brush it off like it's just 'sex'........ no, it can completely change a person and fuck them up for LIFE... it's not just 'sex'. Why should YOU donate to this campaign? My first feature film Violet is 85 percent shot. This film at the end of the day will be finished and delivered to your doorstep soon. This is not a campaign in pre-production, this is also not a campaign that will screw you over. I haven't been in the independent scene that long and I don't know how good my word is... but I've seen people get screwed over with Kickstarter and Indiegogo campaigns... trust me, I've been in those situations too. Actually still waiting for a few of those campaigns to either refund me or send me something haha. So I get it. But this campaign WILL NOT be like that. I have only done three Indiegogo campaigns in the past, but with each of those I made sure to ship as soon as possible and make sure everyone got their perks safe and sound. I love independent film community with all my heart and I want to see it continue to flourish and grow. ALSO keep in mind that the perks could ship earlier than 'March 2020'. I only put March down just in case if the score was taking a while or the artwork or whatever. I hope to have everything finished before the end of the year - but if it does go any longer it will not surpass March of 2020... that I can assure you. Stretch Goal Information IF I'm able to surpass my goal and reach a crazy number I never was able to believe, like I don't even know If I'll raise 3000, but If I do - I have stretch goals in mind that are reallllllly cool extra goodies. I really wanted to use this Kickstarter to raise funds my next feature, but now I have to use it to finish the movie / pay off debt... but if I'm able to raise more to pay off debt / finish the movie, all of the extra funds go straight into my next feature film 'Scarlett' <3  Closing Information This is my first feature film. This film means the world to me. With every film, short or feature, I have done more than simply make a film. I've poured my soul into these scripts. Pieces of myself are scattered within these stories. Making films isn't just about making them, it's more than that to me. It's about telling a meaningful story. So, please... please help me finish this movie. Kaylee Williams, Alyss Winkler, Keith Voigt Jr, Samuel Vainisi and Jason Crowe (from left to right) Alyss Winkler, Jason Crowe, Andres Boeta, Jessi Winston, Samuel Vainisi and Samuel Thompson (from left to right)",42.0,0,"5 Campaigns

<p><strong>I'm ready to make that leap between waiting tables and getting professional illustration work, but I don't have the equipment I need to get going.</strong> Not having professional equipment of my own has been a detriment to my studies and severely weakens my ability to self-promote. I've tried pretty much everything in my power to get the stuff, but it's been a lot of wheel spinning so far.

<p><strong>What a successful campaign would help achieve:</strong></p>

<h3>Residency </h3>
<p>My name is Aron Fischer...and I am a maker of things.  Currently, I am a MFA Candidate in Sculpture at the University of Missouri, Columbia, with hopes to continue on as a working artist/curator after graduation.  For now, I have been offered an amazing 2 week artist residency opportunity at the Haystack Mountain School of Crafts in Deer Isle, Maine.  </p>
<p>An opportunity like this can not be passed up, but to have this offer extended during my career as a graduate student is not only exciting, but is rather trying and exhausting financially (contrary to popular belief...Grad Students do not live a lavish lifestyle.) Because I would be traveling on a graduate students budget, ticket prices can be overwhelming.  I am asking for some support here.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What that means...</h3>
<p>Flights from Columbia, MO to Bangor, ME can run upwards of $700 roundtrip, and since the school is about an hour away from the nearest airport, a taxi/ground transport is the only way to get to the school.  With that said...that is why I am trying to raise $800 to cover these expenses.  I would love to meet and beat that goal, and any money you contribute to this campaign will go to cover my travel expenses to and from Deer Isle, ME.  <strong>Anything over that amount will go toward food/materials/living expenses while I am there.</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Thanks!</h3>
<p>I want to give back to my contributors to show you just how much this experience means to me.  I am an artist/designer that does both additive and subtractive works in paper, clay, metal, wood and basketry based around tools, toys, utensils and items of utility.  You can see some of my works at <a href=""http://www.aronfischer.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.aronfischer.com</a>.  </p>
<p>I have a project that I want to work on while at Haystack - a series of chidrens toys made from wood, ceramic, and basketry dealing with ideas of uncertainty and failures - while exploring some new processes (GLASS BLOWING and METAL SMITHING!) </p>
<p>All of these ideas are great, but I want to make a few series' of handmade items to say thank you.  Different levels of donations will receive one-of-a-kind pieces made personally for you!  If you have certain requests or allergies (specifically since I work in wood...nut allergies such as walnut, pecan, etc., could be an issue for you) please let me know.  Ill work with you!</p>

<p>Control Tower is a large scale interactive artwork at Burning Man 2013. It is a complex, challenging and experimental artwork that embodies the ongoing mission of the International Arts Megacrew - to create &amp; support big, collaborative art projects that promote the creative development &amp; self expression of people from all walks of life.</p>
<p>Control Tower will be a 60' tall interactive platform to which we invite any and all artists to contribute. Every aspect of the tower will be interactive, from the never before seen experimental flame effects, to the massive &amp; dazzling array of RGB lasers, to the shifting patterns that play across the entire surface of the artwork.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>Burning Man is growing rapidly into a global force for good, and our principles are spreading ever further into the world.

<p>IAM is a crew of artists, engineers and volunteers from 22 countries around the world that assemble in Reno, Nevada every summer to build some of the largest and most collaborative work at <a href=""http://www.burningman.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Burning Man</a>. </p>
<p>Once again, we hope to engage hundreds, maybe even thousands of people in a wildly co-creative experiment to see just how far we can take the Burning Man principles of participation, inclusion, and collaboration.</p>

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">UV99 - the Opulent Temple laser crew</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Mischief Lab - purveyors of fine experimental flame effects</p>

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">The Ein Hammer Crew - Interaction programming &amp; nonsense</p>
<p>Would you and your crew like to get involved? Just let us know! This project is rapidly shaping up to be one of those legendary collaborations only possible at Burning Man, so the more the merrier, IMHO!!</p>
<p><strong>Why do we need your support?</strong></p>
<p>For various reasons, including their belief in our ability to raise the required funding ourselves, we did not get an art grant from Burning Man, although they have agreed to support us in all kinds of other, softer ways. </p>
<p>This project is a LOT smaller than the Temple, but due to its complexity and mind-bending awesomeness, it's still gonna cost a significant amount to bring to fruition - about $50,000. We think we can raise about half of that figure via fundraising events, but these events can only be attended by people in Reno and the Bay - so we are here on Indiegogo to ask you guys, the Burning Man community, to help us raise the other half. </p>
<p>You have trusted us and supported us in 2010 and 2011, and if you choose to fund us again, we promise to deliver you another epic, thought provoking, interactive and fundamentally FUN project for you to experience and play with in the sweet, dusty desert this summer at Burning Man 2013. </p>
<p><strong>Donations are Tax Deductible!</strong></p>
<p>In return for your support, we have a range of of juicy schwag for you to choose from as a thank you for your kind donation - but wait, there's more!</p>
<p>Thanks to our Fiscal Sponsor Fractured Atlas, we are delighted to announce that all donations to the project are Tax Deductible to the extent permitted by law. We will be delighted to work with you to ensure you receive a Tax receipt in exchange for your kind donation. </p>

Control Tower is a large scale interactive artwork at Burning Man 2013. It is a complex, challenging and experimental artwork that embodies the ongoing mission of the International Arts Megacrew - to create & support big, collaborative art projects that promote the creative development & self expression of people from all walks of life.
Control Tower will be a 60' tall interactive platform to which we invite any and all artists to contribute. Every aspect of the tower will be interactive, from the never before seen experimental flame effects, to the massive & dazzling array of RGB lasers, to the shifting patterns that play across the entire surface of the artwork.
Why?
Burning Man is growing rapidly into a global force for good, and our principles are spreading ever further into the world. This project will provide a platform for massive international collaboration and participation, allowing artists and burners from all over the world to contribute content and ideas to the final work - a true celebration of our increasingly international and networked community! 
At Burning Man, the Temple embodies the past, our memories, and our internal lives. The Man himself embodies immediacy, the now, and shared experience in the present moment.

</h3> <p>We are a band of friends who are crazy enough to brave the snow, wind and ice for three and a half days -- in January . We are Chris Wing (team captain), Kelly Madison and Candace Washburn. The three of us make up the team ""The Snowflake Assassins"". </p>
<p>Chris studied graphic design with a concentration in illustration at Watkin's College of Art and Design in Nashville. He lived there for six years focusing on 2-D and 3-D work. He moved to Rockford, IL before moving to Chicago in 2011 where he currently resides. He has competed in the Illinois snow sculpting competition two times, with this upcoming year being his third. He loves pixel art, barcades and hanging out with his zoo of animals.</p>
<p>Kelly Madison studied fine art with a concentration in screen printing at Rockford University in Rockford. After finishing college, she moved to Japan to participate in the JET program for several years to teach English. While abroad, she was able to fine tune her style and incorporate East-Asian influences that can be found in her work today. She has competed in the Illinois snow sculpting competition four times, with this upcoming year being her fifth. </p>
<p>Candace Washburn studied music at University of North Texas in Denton. She dabbles in many forms of art, especially illustration and painting. She's lead singer of LePercolateur, an amazing gypsy jazz band in Chicago, IL. This will be her first year taking on the large block of snow.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What's The Sculpture?</h3>
<div>We have to have a sculpture, right? <span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We are doing a sculpture that focuses on everyone's favorite book and TV series: Game of Thrones! This will be carved into a 10'x6'x6' solid block of snow and ice. Depicting a ferocious direwolf, representative of the ancient and proud House Stark, and lion, symbolic of the wealth and pride of House Lannister, the sculpture will capture a </span>flurry<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> of teeth, claws, and fur.</span></span>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We have some basic tools but we are looking to purchase or rent some specialized tools. </p>
<p>We need:</p> <ul> <li>(3) Root cutters</li> <li>(1) Scaffolding </li> <li>(1) Barbwire</li>
<li>(1) 12ft Ladder</li>
<li>(1) Two-man saw</li>
<li>(3) Portable work-lights (We only  had one last year and that made night time carving very interesting.)</li>
<li>All the hothands (These things save lives.When I say lives, I mean fingers.)</li>
<li>(3) Axes</li>
<li>(3) Water-proof gloves</li> </ul>
<div>What you get:</div>
<div><ul>
<li>Digital personal thank you with a $5 donation<br/>
</li>
<li>Access to team play list with plus previous perk with a $10 donation<br/>
</li>
<li>Snail Mail Postcard plus previous perks with a $15 donation<br/>
</li>
<li>Limited Edition Print plus previous perks with a $20 donation<br/>
</li>
<li>Custom Drawing from one of the team members plus previous perks (excluding limit edition print) with a $40 donation.<br/>
</li>
<li>Drawings &amp; Team Sticker from all three members plus previous perks (excluding limited edition print and single drawing) with a $50 donation.<br/>
</li>
<li>Our unconditional love with a $100 donation. This includes all previous perks and the limited edition print. </li>
</ul></div>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>This will be a challenge without most of the items we have listed above. The sculpture is still doable but it will not be as detailed without. Items like root cutters allows us to remove large amounts of snow in a short amount of time. </p>

</div></div>","The Snowflake Assassins
 We are a band of friends who are crazy enough to brave the snow, wind and ice for three and a half days -- in January . We are Chris Wing (team captain), Kelly Madison and Candace Washburn. The three of us make up the team ""The Snowflake Assassins"". 
Chris studied graphic design with a concentration in illustration at Watkin's College of Art and Design in Nashville. He lived there for six years focusing on 2-D and 3-D work. He moved to Rockford, IL before moving to Chicago in 2011 where he currently resides. He has competed in the Illinois snow sculpting competition two times, with this upcoming year being his third. He loves pixel art, barcades and hanging out with his zoo of animals.
Kelly Madison studied fine art with a concentration in screen printing at Rockford University in Rockford. After finishing college, she moved to Japan to participate in the JET program for several years to teach English. While abroad, she was able to fine tune her style and incorporate East-Asian influences that can be found in her work today. She has competed in the Illinois snow sculpting competition four times, with this upcoming year being her fifth. 
Candace Washburn studied music at University of North Texas in Denton. She dabbles in many forms of art, especially illustration and painting. She's lead singer of LePercolateur, an amazing gypsy jazz band in Chicago, IL. This will be her first year taking on the large block of snow.

What's The Sculpture?
We have to have a sculpture, right? We are doing a sculpture that focuses on everyone's favorite book and TV series: Game of Thrones! This will be carved into a 10'x6'x6' solid block of snow and ice. Depicting a ferocious direwolf, representative of the ancient and proud House Stark, and lion, symbolic of the wealth and pride of House Lannister, the sculpture will capture a flurry of teeth, claws, and fur.
   What We Need & What You Get We have some basic tools but we are looking to purchase or rent some specialized tools. 
We need:  (3) Root cutters (1) Scaffolding  (1) Barbwire
(1) 12ft Ladder
(1) Two-man saw
(3) Portable work-lights (We only  had one last year and that made night time carving very interesting.)
All the hothands (These things save lives.When I say lives, I mean fingers.)
(3) Axes
(3) Water-proof gloves 
What you get:

Digital personal thank you with a $5 donation

Access to team play list with plus previous perk with a $10 donation

Snail Mail Postcard plus previous perks with a $15 donation

Limited Edition Print plus previous perks with a $20 donation

Custom Drawing from one of the team members plus previous perks (excluding limit edition print) with a $40 donation.

Drawings & Team Sticker from all three members plus previous perks (excluding limited edition print and single drawing) with a $50 donation.

Our unconditional love with a $100 donation. This includes all previous perks and the limited edition print. 


    Risks & Challenges This will be a challenge without most of the items we have listed above. The sculpture is still doable but it will not be as detailed without. Items like root cutters allows us to remove large amounts of snow in a short amount of time. 
Time is crucial during this competition. We are allowed to work Wednesday 8:00 AM - 11:00 PM, Thursday 8:00 AM - 11:00 PM and Friday 8:00 AM - 12:00 PM Saturday Morning. 
With your help it will reduce any stress we might have about time and allow us to really work on the details. 
    If Your Wallet Can't Help, You Still Can We understand you may not be able to contribute with the holiday season approaching. What you can do is post this everywhere. We want your mom to know how awesome our sculpture will be. 
If you have any of the tools listed and are willing to lend them to us, you can contact Chris at c.wing87@gmail.com. We promise to take good care of any equipment provided. 
We look forward to seeing you on January 17th at Sinnissippi Park so that you can participating in voting for your favorite sculpture!",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: #da8648; font-size: 24px; text-decoration: none;"">The campaign has been relaunched on Kickstarter!</p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: dimgrey; font-size: 15px;""><a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1134016110/nine-from-nine"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1134016110/...</a></p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: #da8648; font-size: 24px; text-decoration: none;"">Nine from Nine</p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: dimgrey; font-size: 15px;"">Nine from Nine will be an illustrated book of a Viking Age poem. It's a visual account of the Norse god Odin’s eighteen magical songs.</p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: dimgrey; font-size: 15px;"">Nine from Nine will be a beautiful book that presents the rich subject matter in a clean and accessible way.</p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: dimgrey; font-size: 15px;""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/645324/pictures/full/20130203060533-FrontCover650new.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: #da8648; font-size: 24px; text-decoration: none;""> </p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: #da8648; font-size: 24px; text-decoration: none;"">Where Does the Poem Come From?</p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: dimgrey; font-size: 15px;"">There are two Icelandic manuscripts that contain the oldest written records of Norse mythology. They are called the Younger and Elder Eddas. The poem is called Ljóðatal and is a small section of the Elder Edda.</p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: dimgrey; font-size: 15px;"">The stories, verses and sayings contained within the Eddas are an incredible source of information about the lives and beliefs of the Vikings.</p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: dimgrey; font-size: 15px;"">For an illustrator, nine worlds inhabitated by gods, giants and trolls is just too exciting to pass up!</p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: dimgrey; font-size: 15px;""> </p>

<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: #da8648; font-size: 24px; text-decoration: none;"">Book Specs</p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: dimgrey; font-size: 15px;"">The book will be Hardback. Approximately 17cm x 20cm (6.5"" x 8"") and 40 pages (80 sides). Each verse of the poem will have 1 to 3 full-page illustrations. There will be a section at the end of the book explaining each verse and some information about it's illustration.</p>
<h2 style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: goldenrod;""> </h2>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: #da8648; font-size: 24px; text-decoration: none;"">Breakdown of the Poem</p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: dimgrey; font-size: 15px;"">The father of the gods, Odin is obsessed with acquiring arcane knowledge. So much so that he has previously given up one of his eyes in exchange for a chance to make use of Mimir’s well of knowledge.</p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: dimgrey; font-size: 15px;"">At the start of this poem, we meet the now one-eyed Odin hanging on the world tree, Yggdrasill.</p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: dimgrey; font-size: 15px;"">Odin stabs himself with his spear, sacrificing himself to himself. Now dead and in the underworld he aquires knowledge of nine songs (these are like charms or spells) from a big, scary giant.</p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: dimgrey; font-size: 15px;"">Odin is then re-born, wiser and inspired. He is able to create a new song from each of the nine taught to him. A stanza (verse) is then dedicated to a desciption of the powerful magical effects of each song.</p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: dimgrey; font-size: 15px;""> </p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: #da8648; font-size: 24px; text-decoration: none;"">Ljóðatal Translation</p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: dimgrey; font-size: 15px;"">You've probably already noticed that whenever possible I've used the original Old Norse words. Sometimes it's good to mix things up. I'm attempting to make something incredibly old more accessible but I don't want to change the original ideas or the translation unless I really have to. This will hopefully produce a much richer experience for the reader.</p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: dimgrey; font-size: 15px;"">I have based my text on an out of copyright translation by Benjamin Thorpe. This translation is one of the more faithful to the original structure and wording of the poem.</p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: dimgrey; font-size: 15px;""> </p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: dimgrey; font-size: 15px;""> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://foursecondmemory.com/nine-from-nine/IndieGoGo/giantbookmarksNew.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: #da8648; font-size: 24px; text-decoration: none;"">Visual Language of the Book</p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: dimgrey; font-size: 15px;"">When designers use type they often use a grid to space out the text so that each heading and paragraph has a visual relationship. This grid will often relate to the size of the page so that all the elements lock together.</p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: dimgrey; font-size: 15px;"">These illustrations are placed on one of these grids but they are also drawn in relation to the grid. It's all part of a contemporary visual debate about how painting meets graphics, especially when using a computer to produce work.</p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: dimgrey; font-size: 15px;"">The book features cool stuff like trolls and giants though, so let's not worry about that too much.</p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: dimgrey; font-size: 15px;"">The colours are chosen to describe specific settings and also the cold muggy light of Iceland. I'm obsessed with colour so i'll be spending way too much time on that.</p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: dimgrey; font-size: 15px;"">Red is used for blood and to signify a link to Niflheim, the land of the dead. If someone has red eyes they really are actually dead. Scary stuff.</p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: dimgrey; font-size: 15px;""> </p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: #da8648; font-size: 24px; text-decoration: none;"">Naughty Bits and Zombie Vikings</p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: dimgrey; font-size: 15px;"">The illustrations will depict some nudity and violence, as befits the subject matter. Also included: trolls, giants, eight-legged horses and zombie Vikings.</p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: dimgrey; font-size: 15px;""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/599538/primary_pictures/full/20121231091205-dwarfsong.jpg?1357157937"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: #da8648; font-size: 24px; text-decoration: none;"">Why Indiegogo?</p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: dimgrey; font-size: 15px;"">I've been working on this project for over a year now. I've been sketching on the train journey into work and then working up these drawings on a computer at home at the weekends.</p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: dimgrey; font-size: 15px;"">Working in this way, the project would take another year to finish. The ambition of this campaign is to get a completed book out there much sooner than this.</p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: dimgrey; font-size: 15px;""> </p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: #da8648; font-size: 24px; text-decoration: none;"">The Goal</p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: dimgrey; font-size: 15px;""><strong>If I Achieve the Goal</strong></p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: dimgrey; font-size: 15px;"">The book will be produced within approximately 3 months from the end of the campaign, depending on printing times. The wallpapers and prints as soon as possible after the campaign ends. Exciting!</p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: dimgrey; font-size: 15px;""> </p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: dimgrey; font-size: 15px;""><strong>If I Don't Achieve the Goal</strong></p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: dimgrey; font-size: 15px;"">The book will take much longer to produce as I fit it in around work, approximately a year from now! The wallpapers and prints much sooner.</p>
<p style=""font-family: helvetica, verdana; color: dimgrey; font-size: 15px;"">If you'd like to get involved, please use PayPal (if possible, if not, don't worry) as this isn't delayed until the end of the campaign.</p>

Nine from Nine
Nine from Nine will be an illustrated book of a Viking Age poem. It's a visual account of the Norse god Odin’s eighteen magical songs.
Nine from Nine will be a beautiful book that presents the rich subject matter in a clean and accessible way.

 
Where Does the Poem Come From?
There are two Icelandic manuscripts that contain the oldest written records of Norse mythology. They are called the Younger and Elder Eddas. The poem is called Ljóðatal and is a small section of the Elder Edda.
The stories, verses and sayings contained within the Eddas are an incredible source of information about the lives and beliefs of the Vikings.
For an illustrator, nine worlds inhabitated by gods, giants and trolls is just too exciting to pass up!
 

Book Specs
The book will be Hardback. Approximately 17cm x 20cm (6.5"" x 8"") and 40 pages (80 sides). Each verse of the poem will have 1 to 3 full-page illustrations. There will be a section at the end of the book explaining each verse and some information about it's illustration.
 
Breakdown of the Poem
The father of the gods, Odin is obsessed with acquiring arcane knowledge. So much so that he has previously given up one of his eyes in exchange for a chance to make use of Mimir’s well of knowledge.
At the start of this poem, we meet the now one-eyed Odin hanging on the world tree, Yggdrasill.
Odin stabs himself with his spear, sacrificing himself to himself. Now dead and in the underworld he aquires knowledge of nine songs (these are like charms or spells) from a big, scary giant.
Odin is then re-born, wiser and inspired. He is able to create a new song from each of the nine taught to him. A stanza (verse) is then dedicated to a desciption of the powerful magical effects of each song.
 
Ljóðatal Translation
You've probably already noticed that whenever possible I've used the original Old Norse words. Sometimes it's good to mix things up. I'm attempting to make something incredibly old more accessible but I don't want to change the original ideas or the translation unless I really have to. This will hopefully produce a much richer experience for the reader.
I have based my text on an out of copyright translation by Benjamin Thorpe. This translation is one of the more faithful to the original structure and wording of the poem.
 
 
Visual Language of the Book
When designers use type they often use a grid to space out the text so that each heading and paragraph has a visual relationship. This grid will often relate to the size of the page so that all the elements lock together.
These illustrations are placed on one of these grids but they are also drawn in relation to the grid. It's all part of a contemporary visual debate about how painting meets graphics, especially when using a computer to produce work.
The book features cool stuff like trolls and giants though, so let's not worry about that too much.
The colours are chosen to describe specific settings and also the cold muggy light of Iceland. I'm obsessed with colour so i'll be spending way too much time on that.
Red is used for blood and to signify a link to Niflheim, the land of the dead. If someone has red eyes they really are actually dead. Scary stuff.
 
Naughty Bits and Zombie Vikings
The illustrations will depict some nudity and violence, as befits the subject matter. Also included: trolls, giants, eight-legged horses and zombie Vikings.

Why Indiegogo?
I've been working on this project for over a year now. I've been sketching on the train journey into work and then working up these drawings on a computer at home at the weekends.
Working in this way, the project would take another year to finish. The ambition of this campaign is to get a completed book out there much sooner than this.
 
The Goal
If I Achieve the Goal
The book will be produced within approximately 3 months from the end of the campaign, depending on printing times. The wallpapers and prints as soon as possible after the campaign ends. Exciting!
 
If I Don't Achieve the Goal
The book will take much longer to produce as I fit it in around work, approximately a year from now! The wallpapers and prints much sooner.
If you'd like to get involved, please use PayPal (if possible, if not, don't worry) as this isn't delayed until the end of the campaign.

Me and You, You and Me
My name's Guy. I'm a freelance designer with 20 years experience in design, illustration, web and print. I have a soft spot for tea and biscuits.
Thanks for taking the time to check out the campaign. If you like the work it'd be great if you could spread the word- tweet it, follow it, like it! Go on, you know you want to.
If you have any questions, ask away.

Their new SLO County art endeavor is called ""Fiasco Gallery"" and is located at Studios on the Park in Paso Robles CA. <br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We officially set up shop at the beginning of August and have been pleasantly surprised with all this town has to offer as well as all the people that support the arts. To make this ""Fiasco"" adventure continue we need your help. The studio/gallery space and other additional fees amount to about $1300 per month. We would really like to stay in this space as long as possible. Realistically, to keep Fiasco Gallery going through the new year would take closer to $5,000 (rent and other fees associated with being members of Studios On The Park). Although we need a lot more than what we're asking for, we will be super stoked and overly grateful to receive anything and we will put any and all funds to good use in an effort to make Fiasco a place worth visiting where you can check out cool artwork, meet and watch us at work, and leave feeling inspired.</span></p>
<p>Like we mentioned above, we've been in the studio since August, but still feel like newbies in Paso Robles and have no idea what we're in for in the coming months. Will the folks in Paso Robles support our artwork as much as our fans and collectors we've gained in SLO?   We've come to Indiegogo in an effort to keep the ball rolling by selling Fiasco t-shirts, super fancy one of kind collaboration pieces and also some limited edition prints. Venturing into the unknown is exciting, but not without a little fear. With your support we can dive in head first with confidence.<br/><br/>Our fancy pants art bios can be seen if you scroll down, but for now here are some photos of our latest collaboration pieces.<br/><br/><b>REWARDS</b><br/><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Please keep in mind when checking out our rewards that all of our art sales go right back into making more art and keeping our studio open.

<br/>We consider this shirt to be our main reward because who doesn't like rockin' an awesome t-shirt, especially when it's got our handsome faces on it. It's a no brainer, people.

And, of course, Made in the good ole' U.S of A.</span><p></p>Screen printed tees are super cool, but every t-shirt printer I've ever met has a minimum number of shirts they need to print to make it worth their while. If minimums aren't met they would go out of business. The minimum is what makes it difficult for artists and designers to get shirts printed. The t-shirt printer we use has a 36 piece minimum, so it would be SUPER COOL if enough of you (36 to be exact) purchase a shirt so that we meet the shirt printers minimum.<br/><br/>This will be a one color (white ink) print on a black tee. It will be available in unisex sizing for Men and Women (size xs, s, m, l, xl, 2xl). Women may prefer to order one size smaller. Once this campaign ends we will post an update with specific sizing information so you know what size will be best for you.<br/><br/><b>Collaboration Art By Jeff And Neal</b></span><br/><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">These examples are all one of a kind originals and available as individual rewards.

<p>Neal Breton, a New Hampshire native, has been a professional artist for twenty years. He studied painting at Pasadena City College. His artistic endeavors in the Los Angeles area lasted over 15 years, in which he showed and sold a large body of work all over Southern California.</p>
<p>Breton moved to the Central Coast in 2008 years ago, where he continued to showcase his work at galleries and cafes. He began a stint as a business owner in 2009, opening up San Luis Art Supply, which became known not only as a place to buy supplies affordably, but as a hub of activity amongst the young and underground art scene. Breton sold the shop in 2012 to pursue other endeavors as a painter and curator.</p>
<p>As an illustrator for the SLO New Times, his work has won awards in 2011 and 2012 from CNPA (California Newspaper Publisher Awards) and AAN (Association of Alternative Newsweeklies). </p>

We had never talked about art, or drawing or anything cultural. My Dad was practical, and never spoke of art or anything having to do with it.  He dug through a closet and found an old manilla envelope.  He opened it up and displayed a stack of drawings of comic book covers from the 1940's that he had copied when he was a teenager growing up in Brooklyn, after the great depression. The drawings were beautiful.  He did them all in pencil and colored pencil.  I was amazed and shocked as he flipped through the art, and he said, ""I wanted you to know that I used to draw too...""  As tears filled my eyes, my heart raced and at that point I knew what I wanted to do with my life... <br/><br/>Sadly those drawings were lost due to Hurricane Sandy... But they changed the course of my life... <br/><p>                 <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/67754/files/20130911084458-gq.jpg?1378914298"" src="""" style=""width: 403.418px; height: 151px;""/></p>I am grateful for my family, my health and the support I have... I am just putting it out there as I am not in a position to move forward in the art world... not yet...<br/><p>Due to the nature of the commercial art industry, everything is going digital... and I need to follow along or I'll be left in the dust.  <span class=""notranlsate""> </span></p>
<p>The more work an artist does the more their drawing/ painting hand and wrist are exhausted and over-stressed.  Using the tool I need, there is smoother, less stressful strain on your hand and wrist.  This will help me in my journey as an illustrator to provide for my family.   I am not in a position that will allow me to acquire the appropriate tools I need for my hand's stress and my career's progression.<br/></p>

Hi.  My name is Gene DeCicco, and for as long as I can remember I have been an artist.   I'll share with you when I knew what I wanted to be...
           When I was a young boy, around 10, my Father (who worked in a factory since he was out of high school) told me he wanted to show me something. We had never talked about art, or drawing or anything cultural. My Dad was practical, and never spoke of art or anything having to do with it.  He dug through a closet and found an old manilla envelope.  He opened it up and displayed a stack of drawings of comic book covers from the 1940's that he had copied when he was a teenager growing up in Brooklyn, after the great depression. The drawings were beautiful.  He did them all in pencil and colored pencil.  I was amazed and shocked as he flipped through the art, and he said, ""I wanted you to know that I used to draw too...""  As tears filled my eyes, my heart raced and at that point I knew what I wanted to do with my life... Sadly those drawings were lost due to Hurricane Sandy... But they changed the course of my life...                  I am grateful for my family, my health and the support I have... I am just putting it out there as I am not in a position to move forward in the art world... not yet...Due to the nature of the commercial art industry, everything is going digital... and I need to follow along or I'll be left in the dust.   
The more work an artist does the more their drawing/ painting hand and wrist are exhausted and over-stressed.  Using the tool I need, there is smoother, less stressful strain on your hand and wrist.  This will help me in my journey as an illustrator to provide for my family.   I am not in a position that will allow me to acquire the appropriate tools I need for my hand's stress and my career's progression.

How Your Contributions Help

My campaign is a simple one.  I need funding to purchase a drawing tablet so I can continue working and push my art forward.  There are screens called Cintiqs, which are computer monitors that you can draw directly on.... they are expensive ($2,000.00 - $2,500.00) amazing pieces of technology that one day I may be able to afford.  But I am realistic  and don't need much, only a chance... and my campaign would allow me to get a less expensive Yiynova MSP19U Tablet Monitor ($599.00+tax+shipping).  It works similarly to the Cintiq  and is more affordable.  It is the solution that will help me get my illustration production to the next level and continue to do what I love as I help my wife to provide for my family while protecting my hand and wrist from further stress and pain.With this monitor, I will be able to create for my kids and survive in the commercial art industry. Growing up in Brooklyn, New York everyone I knew thought I would become ""rich and famous"" for my art.... but that hasn't happened.  I am almost making a living at it but surviving due to my wife's career as a NYC public school teacher.

<p>My name is Robert Roberg. I am an English professor at the University of Florida and I am a 3-D Fluorescent Artist.</p>
<p>My team and I would like to create America’s first fluorescent 3-D art museum. I have been doing fluorescent black light art for many years and about ten years ago discovered Chroma Depth glasses, and by following their web tutorials, have been able to transform my  art into 3-D black light paintings. We are looking for space  to convert into a not-for Profit museum in The <strong>Village of the Arts</strong>  in the ""Bradenton Florida .</p>
<p>The village of the Arts is ""Florida's largest Art colony"". The Village contains over 35  art studios. Our goal is to purchase a house, or building, and turn it into a museum.</p>
<p>We need your help. In order to purchase and prepare the museum we estimate we will need $160,000.00. This will include remodeling a space, lighting, fees for legally incorporating locally, statewide and federally.  Within the first year we plan to apply for non-profit status. The non-profit will own the house and the museum will be administered by a board. We will offer classes in many genres of art with a special emphasis on children.</p>
<p>I have two paintings in the Smithsonian Museum of Art and one of my paintings appeared on the front page of the New York Times. I say this to show that I am a serious and recognized artist. </p>

Rachel Pollack, creator of <i>The Shinning Tribe Tarot</i></font></p>
<br/><p><b>About <i>The Oracle of Initiation </i></b><br/><i>The Oracle of Initiation</i> deck by Mellissae Lucia offers experienced guidance in claiming the beauty in spiritual transformation. The Oracle’s ancient cross-cultural guardians light the way to our rainbows in the dark, the paradox of our greatest gifts hidden within our shadows. <b>Learn to confidently navigate your own initiations</b> with the Oracle’s earthened wisdom, shape-shifting your challenges into your own wild, sovereign brilliance.<br/></p><p>The Oracle deck’s <i>Painted Body </i>series emerged directly from artist Mellissae Lucia’s seven-year vision quest after the death of her husband. All of the images in <i>The Painted Body </i>series were taken alone and nude by the artist herself, in the ancient desert landscape of arroyos, canyons, caves, and graffiti tunnels surrounding Santa Fe, New Mexico. In her work, the camera is held at arm's length, making it a literal extension of her body. None of the images in <i>The Painted Body </i>series are altered or retouched in any way.</p>
<br/><p><b>Making This Happen</b><br/>
I am eight years into this amazing project, and I have been selling Deluxe, limited edition sets of the Oracle deck with the full-size, 400-page book for the last four years. The first edition of 88 decks <b>sold out</b> in 2012, and the second limited edition of 112 is currently available. With print-on-demand costs being high for this Deluxe edition, the $155 price point is an investment. The deck has an underground, cult following, and getting the price point down to $50 will make the deck <b>more accessible </b>for those who are called to it. </p>
I am<b> asking for your support </b>to fund a little over half of the project, at $8,888. The entire project will come in at about $15,000 for the printing of 1,000* decks, shipping, reward fulfillment, technology and design support, copy editing, and fees to both Indiegogo and the payment methods in the campaign. I have self-funded all my previous projects, and it has always been my dream to see the deck in more hands, and <b>I need your help to make this one happen</b>. I will create the New Edition no matter what, it may be a smaller run and a smaller size, so you will get a deck if you make a pledge, but to print the full run of 1,000 I need to reach my goal, or better. <p><br/></p><p>*Update as of 6-17-14. There have been 43 new Tarot-sized editions ordered, and I am going to print a smaller run, at a smaller size, not the edition of 1,000. Your wonderful, affordable Oracle deck will come in a lovely velvet bag, with a downloadable PDF as the text. The text will be a little more robust than it would have been in the booklet, with full-color images of the cards. Each $44 Tarot-sized pledger will also get a *special* and *fun* little gift for rolling with the shifts. And honestly, I will put this out there again, the big, deluxe book is really the best option for full-oracle-engagement, so if you wish to upgrade the extra $33 for US orders (international orders add $67 for the deluxe book and shipping) I lovlingly suggest it. This change also means you should get the deck a little sooner. SWEEET! Thanks to everyone who is supporting this amazing project, and keep sharing it to reach the goal and cover the expenses already invested in the project. Only 4 days left!<br/></p><p></p> <br/><p></p><hr/><p></p>

I slipped into my animal self – and sight, sound, smell, touch, and even taste became attuned and merged. My Western thinking mind no longer had control of me. I was free of ideas of who I was suppose to be.

Part of my own process of claiming my sovereignty during creating the deck was what I call my Artemis Return. Artemis is the virginal Greek huntress goddess who embodies the wild instinctive freedom of the feminine on the land. As a virgin goddess, she is a guardian and guide for young women finding their own authentic power. I have a stash of Deluxe promotional decks from the first printing that I would love to <b>gift to young women</b>. As each $1,111 pledge amount is reached in the campaign, I will send out an update asking your help in finding the young women under 18 who you believe could be powerfully supported by working with the deck. It will be an intuitive lotto as your suggestions flow in, the decks telling me which young women to choose. I believe the personal is political, and the only way we are really going to change the world is one sovereign soul at a time.<p></p>

About The Oracle of Initiation The Oracle of Initiation deck by Mellissae Lucia offers experienced guidance in claiming the beauty in spiritual transformation. The Oracle’s ancient cross-cultural guardians light the way to our rainbows in the dark, the paradox of our greatest gifts hidden within our shadows. Learn to confidently navigate your own initiations with the Oracle’s earthened wisdom, shape-shifting your challenges into your own wild, sovereign brilliance.The Oracle deck’s Painted Body series emerged directly from artist Mellissae Lucia’s seven-year vision quest after the death of her husband. All of the images in The Painted Body series were taken alone and nude by the artist herself, in the ancient desert landscape of arroyos, canyons, caves, and graffiti tunnels surrounding Santa Fe, New Mexico. In her work, the camera is held at arm's length, making it a literal extension of her body. None of the images in The Painted Body series are altered or retouched in any way.
Making This Happen
I am eight years into this amazing project, and I have been selling Deluxe, limited edition sets of the Oracle deck with the full-size, 400-page book for the last four years. The first edition of 88 decks sold out in 2012, and the second limited edition of 112 is currently available. With print-on-demand costs being high for this Deluxe edition, the $155 price point is an investment. The deck has an underground, cult following, and getting the price point down to $50 will make the deck more accessible for those who are called to it. 
I am asking for your support to fund a little over half of the project, at $8,888. The entire project will come in at about $15,000 for the printing of 1,000* decks, shipping, reward fulfillment, technology and design support, copy editing, and fees to both Indiegogo and the payment methods in the campaign. I have self-funded all my previous projects, and it has always been my dream to see the deck in more hands, and I need your help to make this one happen. I will create the New Edition no matter what, it may be a smaller run and a smaller size, so you will get a deck if you make a pledge, but to print the full run of 1,000 I need to reach my goal, or better. *Update as of 6-17-14. There have been 43 new Tarot-sized editions ordered, and I am going to print a smaller run, at a smaller size, not the edition of 1,000. Your wonderful, affordable Oracle deck will come in a lovely velvet bag, with a downloadable PDF as the text. The text will be a little more robust than it would have been in the booklet, with full-color images of the cards. Each $44 Tarot-sized pledger will also get a *special* and *fun* little gift for rolling with the shifts. And honestly, I will put this out there again, the big, deluxe book is really the best option for full-oracle-engagement, so if you wish to upgrade the extra $33 for US orders (international orders add $67 for the deluxe book and shipping) I lovlingly suggest it. This change also means you should get the deck a little sooner. SWEEET! Thanks to everyone who is supporting this amazing project, and keep sharing it to reach the goal and cover the expenses already invested in the project. Only 4 days left!

I was free of ideas of who I was suppose to be. As the sun moved beyond the canyon and shadows fell, my new experiences merged within my more familiar self, now changed forever – now changed for the better. I vibrate differently. I am more assured of my path, and feel the courage to walk it pumping through me.” Coleen Renee, Ellensburg, WA

The land!!), emotionally, spiritually, and energetically beautiful.  The process for me was about leaving old patterns, and taking a courageous leap into an unknown new-self.  I was so honored to have Mellissae hold such a sacred, yet fun space for me. My experience was as much play and joy as it was serious ceremony. Mellissae honored, yet calmed my fears, encouraged me, and fed me yummy food once we arrived back at the car, tired and covered in mud. The insights are still coming four months later, and this was definitely a turning point for me in my process of personal growth and spiritual understanding about my sacred work”  Amy F. Milder, Santa Fe, NM

♥ Other Ways YOU Can HelpWe are building tribes through the grassroots power of crowdfunding, and passing on information about work you love is so essential. Even if you are not called to donate, please spread the word about this project to people who may be inspired by the Oracle’s magic.

Post this campaign on your own Facebook timeline and pages, as well as in your favorite groups. You may also tag your friends in your posts, and directly message them to make sure they get it

Tweet the campaign #OracleofInitiation #Oracle Deck #Tarot-sized #indiegogo

Write Blog posts about the Oracle’s unique gifts

Email 5-10 people personally with whom you wish to share this with 
Tell people one-on-one about how the project speaks to you 

Send the Oracle love to find its way into the hearts and hands of the people it can best support in these fierce and transformative times  

On the Oracle website and Mellissae Lucia Blog is a place called “Ambassador Crowdfunding Resources” that has pre-written quotes, posts, tweets, and images you can copy and paste easily to be a really brilliant deck devotee. The deck was made in the spirit of collaboration, and it is time for the larger tribe to catapult it into its next phase. Thank you SO MUCH, we cannot do this without you.  
♥ Artemis Return-gifting the deck to girlsI believe deeply in the Oracle’s ability to guide anyone through initiatory transformations, and its unique mysteries speak powerfully to the fierceness of young women's journeys. Part of my own process of claiming my sovereignty during creating the deck was what I call my Artemis Return. Artemis is the virginal Greek huntress goddess who embodies the wild instinctive freedom of the feminine on the land. As a virgin goddess, she is a guardian and guide for young women finding their own authentic power. I have a stash of Deluxe promotional decks from the first printing that I would love to gift to young women. As each $1,111 pledge amount is reached in the campaign, I will send out an update asking your help in finding the young women under 18 who you believe could be powerfully supported by working with the deck. It will be an intuitive lotto as your suggestions flow in, the decks telling me which young women to choose. I believe the personal is political, and the only way we are really going to change the world is one sovereign soul at a time.

We made it, everybody! Thank you so much for supporting anipan!
If you are an anipan backer, please check your inbox (or spam box) for an email confirming your address and reward tiers. We will be sending out rewards at the beginning of June.
If you have not yet received your user id code, please hold tight - we're still sending these out in order of receipt, so please look out for them over the next few hours.
Our contest winners will be announced over the coming days, so please check back to see if you're a winner!
We will be adding more updates to our Indiegogo and social networking pages over the coming months:

Twitter: @anipancom

Tumblr: anipan-com.tumblr.com

Facebook: facebook.com/anipancom

 
A big thank you!


To all of our backers, who helped us hit out goal in the last few minutes;
To all of our artists, who volunteered their time and talents;
To everybody who helped to get the word out there;
To those who left such motivating comments
...and to everybody who believed in us!


 
What next?
We're going to complete work on anipan, launch it into private alpha in June, and release a beta soon after. anipan will launch to the public later this year.
 
We're going to do our best to bring you a groundbreaking community for artists and art appreciators that changes the way we submit and view artwork on the web.
 
We look forward to seeing you there!- Eddz, Megan, and Arco 
 


Hello!We're building a new community for artists, called anipan.
anipan will:

put the emphasis back on presenting your artwork beautifully;
reduce copyright infringement of high resolution works;
make your artwork more accessible to a larger global audience;
and to revolutionise the sharing of your artwork with your friends and followers all around the web.

We've re-thought the art community fundamentals, such as how you get your works online and how people view and interact with them. We've discovered a way to cut copyright infringement, while making viewing your artwork even more engrossing. And we're intending to make it even easier to upload creations to art communities and social networks you're already a part of. You can see examples of these developments in action in our video updates.

For the artist, if the amount of time spent promoting your artwork can be reduced, you can spend more time on being an artist.
And for the art lovers, we want to make your experiences when viewing artwork even more lifelike and engaging.

Please take a look at our video to see how we have so far been able to achieve these things.
We're doing this because we love artwork, and we want to inspire creation.
 

With the support of some very talented artists, we've created a range of goodies that we will send to you when you back anipan.

We're also offering Founding Member status, lunch with the team, and featuring on the anipan homepage!
Plus, you can have the site mascots based on your name and likeness. And, somebody out there will be the person to press the red button that switches anipan into public beta mode! Will it be you?
Launching a large site is expensive, and we want to get it right, without a hiccup. We're asking for your support to help us complete the site's development and cover large upfront expenses including servers (there will be five to begin with!), software, and administration.
Our target is $25,000. Let's go for it!
Thank you for reading. We hope you are able to join us in this campaign to be a part of a new and exciting community for artists.
Please help us to reach our goal by spreading the word to your friends, family, and followers around the web.
Thanks again!

<h3>My story</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: arial;""><font size=""3"">Hi, my name is Olya.</font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: arial;""><font size=""3""> I am an architect by profession but my true passion has always been artistic design.  This
is why, after ten years of working for various firms, I decided to
quit architecture altogether.</font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: arial;""><font size=""3"">It sounds like it was an easy decision to make, but it wasn't.  I was (and still am) a mother of two small children with a very modest family income.  I was closing in on my 40th birthday and realized that I never did anything else with my career except work as an architectural technician.  And I wasn't happy.  When I decided to quit I felt like I was throwing away all my years of experience and schooling - civil engineering high school, architectural university.  My family and friends were doubtful of my decision, and who could blame them?  Even I was.  I was questioning myself constantly for months on end, and it  was difficult, but through it all my gut feeling kept telling me to change, even if I had no clue what I wanted to do.  <br/></font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: arial;""><font size=""3"">So I did.<br/></font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: arial;""><font size=""3"">As a child and a young girl I was always very good at drawing and painting, but when I got older life happened and I put my youthful passions on the back burner... until now.  </font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: arial;""><font size=""3"">I am giving myself a chance to rediscover and wake up this passion of mine.  Today I am feeling wonderfully passionate (and a little scared) about my new venture and there is no better feeling in the whole world!!!</font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font size=""3""><span style=""font-family: arial;"">I am creating
family trees... with a twist!</span></font><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span></p>
<h3>Hangyourfamily.com story</h3>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: arial;""><font size=""3"">I am in the process of creating hangyourfamily.com, an e-commerce website dedicated to selling
unique, digitally-drawn family trees that are a fresh and creative alternative to the
traditional trees.  The major differences between my trees and traditional trees are: <br/></font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: arial;""><font size=""3"">a) the design.  There really isn't anything out there like mine.</font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: arial;""><font size=""3"">b) the ability for clients to insert their own photos/info into an existing
template(s) before downloading the finished version onto their computer as a JPEG image, which can then be displayed in many different ways.   Nobody knows your
family better than you do!  Clients will also have the option of making their family trees come to life with my help.  Clients will be able to upload their pictures/info onto the website and I will cut, re-size and adjust the color scheme for a higher-quality, professional look.  I will ship the final print on chosen material, such as canvas, watercolor or photographic paper, etc.<br/></font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: arial;""><font size=""3"">All of my templates are designed in such a way
that the missing photos (if any) will not disrupt the beauty of the
piece. My art work will show instead in the designated spaces where photos are missing.   Even if you just have the names and years of
birth/death (optional but suggested) all of my templates will look stunning. </font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: arial;""><font size=""3"">I would love for everyone to be able to afford my templates, and my competitive prices are going to reflect that.<br/></font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: arial;""><font size=""3"">I am presently working on developing new templates for diverse
families: gay parents, adopted children, children from previous
marriages  or relationships, etc.</font></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The impact<br/>
</h3>
<font size=""3""><span style=""font-family: arial;"">Your contribution will help enormously.  The funds raised will ensure that I launch my start up.  If I don't raise enough money I will have to find alternative solutions but I am determined and passionate about my project to make it come to life.  It will be longer and more complicated without your help, but I will make it happen.</span></font><br/>
</div><div>
<h3>What I need &amp; What you get</h3>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: arial;""><font size=""3"">There
are many expenses associated with my start up:</font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: arial;""><font size=""3"">- paying all legal fees <br/></font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: arial;""><font size=""3"">- paying a web programmer to create a fully functioning e-commerce
website with the special interactive tools that will permit clients to rotate,

Hi, my name is Olya.
 I am an architect by profession but my true passion has always been artistic design.  This
is why, after ten years of working for various firms, I decided to
quit architecture altogether.
It sounds like it was an easy decision to make, but it wasn't.  I was (and still am) a mother of two small children with a very modest family income.  I was closing in on my 40th birthday and realized that I never did anything else with my career except work as an architectural technician.  And I wasn't happy.  When I decided to quit I felt like I was throwing away all my years of experience and schooling - civil engineering high school, architectural university.  My family and friends were doubtful of my decision, and who could blame them?  Even I was.  I was questioning myself constantly for months on end, and it  was difficult, but through it all my gut feeling kept telling me to change, even if I had no clue what I wanted to do.  
So I did.
As a child and a young girl I was always very good at drawing and painting, but when I got older life happened and I put my youthful passions on the back burner... until now.  
I am giving myself a chance to rediscover and wake up this passion of mine.  Today I am feeling wonderfully passionate (and a little scared) about my new venture and there is no better feeling in the whole world!!!
I am creating
family trees... with a twist!

Hangyourfamily.com story
I am in the process of creating hangyourfamily.com, an e-commerce website dedicated to selling
unique, digitally-drawn family trees that are a fresh and creative alternative to the
traditional trees.  The major differences between my trees and traditional trees are: 
a) the design.  There really isn't anything out there like mine.
b) the ability for clients to insert their own photos/info into an existing
template(s) before downloading the finished version onto their computer as a JPEG image, which can then be displayed in many different ways.   Nobody knows your
family better than you do!  Clients will also have the option of making their family trees come to life with my help.  Clients will be able to upload their pictures/info onto the website and I will cut, re-size and adjust the color scheme for a higher-quality, professional look.  I will ship the final print on chosen material, such as canvas, watercolor or photographic paper, etc.
All of my templates are designed in such a way
that the missing photos (if any) will not disrupt the beauty of the
piece. My art work will show instead in the designated spaces where photos are missing.   Even if you just have the names and years of
birth/death (optional but suggested) all of my templates will look stunning. 
I would love for everyone to be able to afford my templates, and my competitive prices are going to reflect that.
I am presently working on developing new templates for diverse
families: gay parents, adopted children, children from previous
marriages  or relationships, etc.

The impact

Your contribution will help enormously.  The funds raised will ensure that I launch my start up.  If I don't raise enough money I will have to find alternative solutions but I am determined and passionate about my project to make it come to life.  It will be longer and more complicated without your help, but I will make it happen.

What I need & What you get
There
are many expenses associated with my start up:
- paying all legal fees 
- paying a web programmer to create a fully functioning e-commerce
website with the special interactive tools that will permit clients to rotate,
scale, space and place their photos/info in the designated spaces, which is the most expensive cost of my start up 
- paying for advertisement;  
- printing business cards;  


- printing each of my templates on a variety of printing materials 
My
goal is to raise $4500.  Every cent raised will be well-spent!   No
matter what amount you donate, you will have my eternal gratitude.  Check
out all my perks and find something that will appeal to you.

<h3>There’s no place like dome!</h3>
<p>Root society can best be defined as a connection between spectacular people from all over the world. If you are reading this, you probably understand that spirit and its importance. It has nothing to do with whether you can attend this year or not.  </p>
<p>Root Society has become renowned for its creative efforts within the Burning Man community and on the global stage of innovative music and dance venues.  Every year we deliver our gift of inspirational architecture, cutting edge music, dazzling visual arts, an infamous sound system, and an environment for people to unite and dance together in celebration of art and the creative impulse.</p>
<h2>We need your help.</h2>
<p>The expense requirement for Root Society to bring its own artistic impulse to the desert is substantial. This year for the first time we are asking for our family's help.</p>
<p>The contributions will help fund the cranes, scissor lifts, generators, boom lifts and lulls, scaffolding, domes, projectors, screens, LED light panels, color blasts, black lights and strobes, transportation and shipping costs, and provisions to sustain a crew of 100+ people for 10 days in the desert.</p>
<p>That’s where the real expense is, it’s true, but these expenses are at essence about connecting <strong>us</strong>  - and reminding <strong>us</strong> that we, together, are the art we seek in the world. All the funds collected will be directed to Root Society at Burningman alone.  </p>
<p>We cannot express our thanks effectively enough with just words. Every contribution will be acknowledged with an iconic 2012 Root Society T-shirt gift.  It’s 100% cotton, athletic fit, and will forever remind you of the Root Society Burning Man Experience that you are a stake holder in and of the Root family that you are a part of. You can check out the design in this campaign's gallery!</p>
<h3>***Please type your t-shirt size at the end of your address in parentheses! Example: 2:00 &amp; Esplanade (L) Black Rock City, NV (If you do not want a t-shirt please put an (X) in parentheses)***</h3>
<h2>It is significant to us all.</h2>
<p>Bringing people together through music and dance is powerful. Building something out of nothing with a worldwide network of talent is even more powerful. When you contribute not only do we get a chance to thank you with an authentic Root Society T-shirt, but we but we also create a place for the Root Society network to come together in a very sepcial way. Once you've experienced Root Society at Burning Man (or met someone who has) you know that you've become part of an amazing network....an amazing family of spirits.  </p>
<h2>Broke? Still want to help?</h2>
<p>Whether you can afford to donate $1000 or $1, every dollar helps and is immensely appreciated. Some people just can’t contribute financially, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help.  Our Root Society fundraiser has to be about our spirits. In order for us to succeed at <strong>giving away 5000+ t-shirts</strong> your role in personally asking friends, family, artists, music and dance lovers to support us is equally as important. </p>
<p>Pass on this message through email, facebook, and personally reaching out to your friends and family and we'll reach our goals without a doubt.  </p>

<p><strong>About the Artist</strong></p>
<p>My name is Andrew Young I'm a recording artist, songwriter, content creator, producer, and story teller. More Importantly, I'm a mouthpiece for faith! My mission in life is to help people build there faith 1 story at a time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>My Football Dream </strong></p>
<p>""My Football Dream"" is a story about an obsessed football fan &amp; songwriter (A.Young) who was recently released from the Yale psychiatric hospital after what doctors described as a ""drug induced psychosis"". After an 8 month stint of writers block he's finally inspired to write a song about his favorite football team and just as he begins writing his wife reminds him to take his colonopin (a sleeping pill) and he drifts off into a dream world where he imagines himself as a pro football player struggling to succeed in the football world. </p>
<p>In his football dream he imagines a struggle that very much parallels the adversity I've faced in my own football dreams as a recording artist (TheMadFanatic). He struggles with addiction and he struggles financially to provide for his family . This story is one of incredible perseverance and faith and tackles a number of hot button issues affecting pro football today and parodies a lot of classic football films. ""My Football Dream"" is an incredible story with real life drama, incredible music, and just the right amount of humor. This hip hop/pop culture musical has all the makings of an instant classic.</p>
<p>We are not only releasing a book with the script and dialog but also an audio experience in the form of a 24 track album as well as a full length film and  12 episode VR180 Series. The VR180 series is going to be used to raise money and awareness for 12 great causes through Cause51.org, a new platform I'm premiering with this project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Cause51.org</strong></p>
<p>""My Football Dream"" will be the first project to launch on Cause5.org,  a platform I developed as a way for production houses to use their talent and content to raise money and awareness for good causes. On Cause51 creators accept donations from their audience and donate 51% of the money they raise to the cause they are hoping to raise awareness with the particular piece of content. The underlying cause of cause51 is creators and creating a platform that enables artists who actually want to use their art to make the world a better place to have a platform where they can earn and income from their art. So for that reason the production house keeps 49%. (after platform fees). The reason they keep slightly less then what they give is because while we believe in both giving and receiving, we believe the energy of giving more than you receive makes it a true give and we wanted to shift the ""house always wins"" paradigm so on Cause51 the cause always wins. </p>
<p>When ""My Football Dream"" is released, we will be asking viewers to donate a minimum of $2 to experience each episode and each episode will be used to raise money and awareness for a different charity including some NFL players charities, Kalief Browder Foundation, and many more amazing foundations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Our Goal is to raise $10,000 to produce the book, full length film, audio soundtrack, and 12 episode VR180 series.</p>

<p>In addition to inspiring dreamers all over the world to never give up on their dreams, ""My Football Dream"" is going to be used to show how creatives can use this new platform ""Cause51"" to earn a living creating art designed to raise awareness and money for good causes. Without giving too much away each episode touches on an issue that affects people in the football world and beyond and will be used to raise money for a great charity that's making a real difference pertaining to that issue for example there is an episode called ""move the chains"" where the starting Quarterback Cap O'Connell takes a knee during the national anthem and the entire second verse talks about an injustice that took place with Kalief Browder and how bail reform is something we all need to get involved in  and at the end of the song my character breaks the 4th wall to explain to the audience that the issue at hand isn't black vs white or democrat vs republican or brown lives vs blue lives but rather a much simpler concept I believe football fans can grasp. It's about offense and defense either you are on the side that wants to continue moving the chains closer to the goal of liberty and justice for all or you are trying to impede that progress. I chose to raise awareness and money for the Kalief Browder Foundation because unlike some bail reform charities that simply bail kids out at Rikers that aren't afforded speedy trials which I consider a band-aid, their foundation teaches how to get involved in politics and push for new legislation to get passed to actually fix the system from within. Every episode is important tho not all as heavy handed of politically charged but ""My Football Dream"" is going to make a real impact on the world in a positive way and help shine a light not only on some important issues but some great causes that are actively addressing those issues and the groundbreaking way it's being released is going to set up creatives to thrive for years to come.</p>

<p>Last year, Amsterdam based artist <a href=""http://www.dadara.nl/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Dadara</a> started a new bank: <a href=""http://blog.artasmoney.com/art-as-money/our-mission/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""The Exchangibition Bank"">The Exchanghibition Bank</a>. In an Amsterdam shopping center he <a href=""http://blog.artasmoney.com/exchanghibition-bank/photos-of-last-evening-with-larry-harvey-in-magna-plaza/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">presented</a> his new Exchangibition Banknote to Larry Harvey, the founder of the Burning Man Festival, and during the 2011 edition festival he managed to open up <a href=""http://blog.artasmoney.com/exchanghibition-bank/banking-in-the-dust/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Black Rock City branch</a> of his bank. <br/><br/> Dadara has built some big interactive art projects in previous years as well, such as the <a href=""http://www.dadara.nl/sculptures-and-installations/Fools-Ark"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Fools Ark</a>, a wooden threemaster shipped from the Netherlands to the Nevada desert and then burnt, the <a href=""http://www.dadara.nl/sculptures-and-installations/burning-greymen"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Burning Greymen</a>, an altar surrounded by 140 paper mache Greymen, and <a href=""http://www.dadara.nl/sculptures-and-installations/dreamyourtopia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Checkpoint Dreamyourtopia</a>, a border control checkpoint to enter your own Dreams.<br/><br/> The Exchangibition bank is an ongoing project which raises questions about the value(s) of Art and Money. As a part of this project, he now wants to grow a Transformoney Tree in the vast moneyless desert of the Burning Man Festival.</p>
<p><img alt=""transformoney tree"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i251.photobucket.com/albums/gg314/dadara/treeinstudiowithbanknotessmall.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""transformoney tree""/><br/><br/><br/><strong>What is the nature of this tree?</strong><br/><br/> Money plays such a big part in our everyday lives that it has almost become part of our nature. But most people don’t realize that humans have lived without money for the largest part of their history - and possibly will do so again in the future. Long after money has disappeared, nature will still be there and we might still be able to pick things of real value from trees.</p>
<p>The Transformoney Tree aims to make people conscious of the real value of money. Participants in this art installation can pick Exchangibition banknotes from the tree, while decorating its bark by gluing one-dollar bills, or other currency, onto it. We will make this tree grow together, and by doing that you will turn your money into Art and become one of the artists who helped make this Dream evolve! After all, isn't there an artist hidden inside all of us? Without your contribution the tree will be 'worthless' (pun intended)........</p>
<p>We even need you to help us with our promotional video featured above! Send us your short webcam video with your view on money, and we might include it in our next video!<br/><br/> In the process every dollar bill will transform from money to art material. It will lose its financial value, but it will add value to the artwork, especially if it is personalized in an artistic way by the participant. After all, that extra value added by you won't get lost!</p>
<p><img alt=""Transformoney Tree"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i251.photobucket.com/albums/gg314/dadara/transformoneytreeWEB.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Transformoney Tree""/><br/><br/><br/><strong>How can I help grow it?</strong></p>
<p>We do need money to grow the Transformoney tree. But unlike most projects on Indiegogo, we prefer your physical bank notes over a donation by card or bank transfer, because we can only use physical bills as art material for the tree. If, however, we will receive donations online we will use them to buy art materials (or in other words: one-dollar banknotes). When personalizing your bill, keep in mind that only one side will be visible, because it will be glued to the tree.</p>
<p><img alt=""custom dollar"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i251.photobucket.com/albums/gg314/dadara/dollar-ralfvanpelt.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""custom dollar""/><br/><br/> You can also sign up as an Exchanghibition Bank Ambassador by sending us an email - to inartwetrust (at) artasmoney (dot) com - to help us collect art materisal for the Transformoney Tree. After you have signed up we will send you a personal badge to identify yourself as an ambassador and an envelope to collect the art materials. Collecting art materials becomes even more fun when you throw a <a href=""http://blog.artasmoney.com/tree/customizing-art-materials/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Customizing Party</span></a><br/><br/>It would be fantastic if you can meet us at the Burning Man Festival in person to hand over your art material collection. Alternatively, you could mail it to our Dutch or U.S. representative before we head out to the desert:</p>
<p>Joris Hofmans, Prinsengracht 113 K, 1015 DP Amsterdam, Netherlands</p>
<p>Bridgewire c/o Transformoney Tree, 1055 Industrial Way, Suite 20, Sparks, NV 89431, United States</p>
<p>And of course we also need you to help spread the word, because we will need thousands of banknotes to make the tree grow, and the more people who contribute, the more powerful the transformoneyational qualities of this tree will be!</p>
<p>A start for spreading the word would be to 'like' our <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/artasmoney"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook page</a> and share it with others.</p>
<p>And, as mentioned already before, we would love to receive your videos with you holding your art material donation in front of you and telling us in one sentence your thoughts about money, so you'll be featured in our next video to help promote this project :-)</p>
<p>After all, changing the world one banknote at a time, requires lots of banknotes!</p>

Last year, Amsterdam based artist Dadara started a new bank: The Exchanghibition Bank. In an Amsterdam shopping center he presented his new Exchangibition Banknote to Larry Harvey, the founder of the Burning Man Festival, and during the 2011 edition festival he managed to open up the Black Rock City branch of his bank.  Dadara has built some big interactive art projects in previous years as well, such as the Fools Ark, a wooden threemaster shipped from the Netherlands to the Nevada desert and then burnt, the Burning Greymen, an altar surrounded by 140 paper mache Greymen, and Checkpoint Dreamyourtopia, a border control checkpoint to enter your own Dreams. The Exchangibition bank is an ongoing project which raises questions about the value(s) of Art and Money. As a part of this project, he now wants to grow a Transformoney Tree in the vast moneyless desert of the Burning Man Festival.
What is the nature of this tree? Money plays such a big part in our everyday lives that it has almost become part of our nature. But most people don’t realize that humans have lived without money for the largest part of their history - and possibly will do so again in the future. Long after money has disappeared, nature will still be there and we might still be able to pick things of real value from trees.
The Transformoney Tree aims to make people conscious of the real value of money. Participants in this art installation can pick Exchangibition banknotes from the tree, while decorating its bark by gluing one-dollar bills, or other currency, onto it. We will make this tree grow together, and by doing that you will turn your money into Art and become one of the artists who helped make this Dream evolve! After all, isn't there an artist hidden inside all of us? Without your contribution the tree will be 'worthless' (pun intended)........
We even need you to help us with our promotional video featured above! Send us your short webcam video with your view on money, and we might include it in our next video! In the process every dollar bill will transform from money to art material. It will lose its financial value, but it will add value to the artwork, especially if it is personalized in an artistic way by the participant. After all, that extra value added by you won't get lost!
How can I help grow it?
We do need money to grow the Transformoney tree. But unlike most projects on Indiegogo, we prefer your physical bank notes over a donation by card or bank transfer, because we can only use physical bills as art material for the tree. If, however, we will receive donations online we will use them to buy art materials (or in other words: one-dollar banknotes). When personalizing your bill, keep in mind that only one side will be visible, because it will be glued to the tree.
 You can also sign up as an Exchanghibition Bank Ambassador by sending us an email - to inartwetrust (at) artasmoney (dot) com - to help us collect art materisal for the Transformoney Tree. After you have signed up we will send you a personal badge to identify yourself as an ambassador and an envelope to collect the art materials. Collecting art materials becomes even more fun when you throw a Customizing PartyIt would be fantastic if you can meet us at the Burning Man Festival in person to hand over your art material collection. Alternatively, you could mail it to our Dutch or U.S. representative before we head out to the desert:
Joris Hofmans, Prinsengracht 113 K, 1015 DP Amsterdam, Netherlands
Bridgewire c/o Transformoney Tree, 1055 Industrial Way, Suite 20, Sparks, NV 89431, United States
And of course we also need you to help spread the word, because we will need thousands of banknotes to make the tree grow, and the more people who contribute, the more powerful the transformoneyational qualities of this tree will be!
A start for spreading the word would be to 'like' our Facebook page and share it with others.
And, as mentioned already before, we would love to receive your videos with you holding your art material donation in front of you and telling us in one sentence your thoughts about money, so you'll be featured in our next video to help promote this project :-)
After all, changing the world one banknote at a time, requires lots of banknotes!

<h1>WHERE THE MONEY WILL GO</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Everything is designed, I need your help to make the GLOBALLS.<br/></p>
<h4>Fourteen ORIGINAL 3D Mitered, Laser-Engraved, Wooden GLOBALLS with Wood Imported From Every Continent<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> </span>
</h4>
<p><b>1.</b> <b>IMPORTING THE WOOD</b>. The original wood blocks will be sourced by good friends of mine from the 7 different continents (Antarctic wood will be from the forests that were there thousands of years ago and migrated to the southern hemisphere). Importing heavy blocks of wood costs money, especially when it's Eucalyptus from Australia!</p>
<p><b>2.</b> <b>MAKING THE GLOBALLS</b>. The wooden blocks will be 3D mitered and laser-engraved in both Portland, Oregon and Brooklyn, New York. Both of those processes and shipping cost $$ too.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> <b>CREATING A PERMANENT EXHIBITION</b>. 7 balls will travel and 7 will go into a permanent exhibition that will hopefully travel from museum to museum. This exhibition will feature all the peripheral artifacts and documentation from the GLOBALL experience. </p>
<p><b>4.</b> <b>LAUNCH OF GLOBALL</b>. A kickoff event will hand the GLOBALLS out to 6 good friends. The 7th GLOBALL will go to a random attendee. This is part of the entire art project as much as anything else so it has to be worthy of the entire experience. </p>
<p><b>5.</b> <b>GLOBALL WEBSITE</b>. This isn't just a blog, it's a robust and dynamic social networking website that allows for tracking of the GLOBALLS, profile building, interconnectivity and outerconnectivity with the real world.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> <b>KEEPING THE GLOBALLS ROLLING</b>. There is no set end date to GLOBALL. Part of your funding will go towards keeping the project afloat for the next year. That means a lot of elbow grease and sweat from yours truly. I would greatly appreciate your help!</p>
<p><b>THE IMMEDIATE GOAL</b> is to execute the construction of the GLOBALLS within one month from the end of the IndieGoGo campaign and have the launch party shortly after, in late 2013. </p>
<p><b>THE STRETCH GOAL </b>is to keep the project going indefinitely. There is no end date, no final conclusion. Once the GLOBALLS enter the world, they are literally, out of my hands! Hearing people's stories and connections are what the project will become about. I can't wait!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h1>THE IMPACT</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Like with any creative endeavor, the biggest risk is not doing it. As citizens who inhabit Spaceship Earth, we all know that the only constant is that things move forward. I'm excited to push the boundaries of social networking and I am fully confident I can execute GLOBALL with integrity. I have been working successfully as an artist in New York City for the last 20 years with a speciality in pushing art into new territories and executing large, unusual projects. GLOBALL is no different. Thankfully, I will have some great help.</p>
<p>Melea Seward, writer and TEDx fellow is mentoring me on the project and keeping me on the right track. I also have a robust Do-It-Yourself community throughout the world who are helping me on all facets of the project too. Artists, fabricators, producers, writers, musicians, filmmakers and philosophers are just some of the people who have already stepped forward to help with GLOBALL. The support for this idea is electrifying and getting larger everyday!</p>
<p>Lastly, I have one invaluable and constantly underestimated asset, YOU. You're the greatest contributor and it literally couldn't, wouldn't and shouldn't happen without you! I know you're busy and hard working folks, so let me thank you for your time and assistance in advance. : )</p>
<p></p>

<h1>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP: SHARE!</h1>

4. LAUNCH OF GLOBALL. A kickoff event will hand the GLOBALLS out to 6 good friends. The 7th GLOBALL will go to a random attendee. This is part of the entire art project as much as anything else so it has to be worthy of the entire experience. 
5. GLOBALL WEBSITE. This isn't just a blog, it's a robust and dynamic social networking website that allows for tracking of the GLOBALLS, profile building, interconnectivity and outerconnectivity with the real world.
6. KEEPING THE GLOBALLS ROLLING. There is no set end date to GLOBALL. Part of your funding will go towards keeping the project afloat for the next year. That means a lot of elbow grease and sweat from yours truly. I would greatly appreciate your help!
THE IMMEDIATE GOAL is to execute the construction of the GLOBALLS within one month from the end of the IndieGoGo campaign and have the launch party shortly after, in late 2013. 
THE STRETCH GOAL is to keep the project going indefinitely. There is no end date, no final conclusion. Once the GLOBALLS enter the world, they are literally, out of my hands! Hearing people's stories and connections are what the project will become about. I can't wait!


THE IMPACT

Like with any creative endeavor, the biggest risk is not doing it. As citizens who inhabit Spaceship Earth, we all know that the only constant is that things move forward. I'm excited to push the boundaries of social networking and I am fully confident I can execute GLOBALL with integrity. I have been working successfully as an artist in New York City for the last 20 years with a speciality in pushing art into new territories and executing large, unusual projects. GLOBALL is no different. Thankfully, I will have some great help.
Melea Seward, writer and TEDx fellow is mentoring me on the project and keeping me on the right track. I also have a robust Do-It-Yourself community throughout the world who are helping me on all facets of the project too. Artists, fabricators, producers, writers, musicians, filmmakers and philosophers are just some of the people who have already stepped forward to help with GLOBALL. The support for this idea is electrifying and getting larger everyday!
Lastly, I have one invaluable and constantly underestimated asset, YOU. You're the greatest contributor and it literally couldn't, wouldn't and shouldn't happen without you! I know you're busy and hard working folks, so let me thank you for your time and assistance in advance. : )


OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP: SHARE!
GLOBALL is about sharing a work of art with the most meaningful person in your life. Help me to start the process of sharing right now by reaching out to a VERY GOOD FRIEND who would be interested in this unique project. Have them join our Facebook page, follow us on Twitter and for the more visually inclined, Instagram. They can also join our mailing list by emailing us a request at wheresgloball at gmail dot com.I can really use your help and spreading the word is a great FREE way to do it!",16.0,0,"1 Campaign

Σαν μία μυρωδιά  που κάπως κάτι σου θυμίζει, εγείρει τη φαντασία και σε αναστατώνει, αλλά και σου προκαλεί αγωνία όπως κάθε καινούργιο και άγνωστο. Ονειρεύτηκα παιδιά που τα σπίτια τους είναι άλλα σπίτια. Που τα παιδιά είναι άλλα παιδιά. Που η φαντασία τους δεν είναι δειλή όπως η δική μου. Που τολμήσανε να κοιμηθούν σε ιπτάμενα χαλιά, να γίνουν ακροβάτες σε κόκκινο τσίρκο. Που γκρεμίσανε τοίχους για να φωλιάσουνε τα άγρια ζώα του δάσους στην κουβέρτα τους. Έτσι, για να μετατρέπεται το φευγιό της φαντασίας σε ύλη.""</i></p>

<p><u><b>Εικαστική εγκατάσταση «Home? το μικρό-μικρό σπίτι» </b></u>
</p>Επιλέξαμε να εκφραστούμε πρώτα με την εικαστική γλώσσα ώστε να δώσουμε μορφή  στις σκέψεις και στις ιδέες μας. Η εικαστική προσέγγιση σε συνδυασμό με την τεχνολογία αποδείχτηκε απολύτως κατάλληλη για μία νέα βιωματική εξερεύνηση, όπου τα συναισθήματα και οι επιθυμίες των «Εν δυνάμει» καλλιτεχνών δημιουργούν ένα άμεσο διάλογο αντιδράσεων και ερεθισμάτων.  <p><span><i><u><b><br/></b></u></i></span></p>

<p><span><i><u><b></b></u></i>Ακολουθούμε μια πορεία που περιλαμβάνει προσωπικές συνεντεύξεις των μελών της ομάδας, συζητήσεις, κατασκευή μακέτας και εφαρμογή της σε φυσικό χώρο και μέγεθος ώστε να καταφέρουμε να δημιουργήσουμε μια νέα πραγματικότητα, έναν νέο μικρό-μικρό κόσμο . Οι καλλιτέχνες - δημιουργοί καταθέτουν ιδέες, σκέψεις και κείμενα για το ""σπίτι"" που μέσα σ' αυτό θα ήθελαν να ζουν. </span></p>

<p>Μετά τη κατασκευή της μακέτας, η δημιουργική ομάδα ετοιμάζει σε πραγματικό χώρο το δωμάτιο ακριβώς όπως το έχει φανταστεί ο κάθε δημιουργός. Η κινηματογραφική ομάδα με ειδικά σχεδιασμένο εξοπλισμό καταγράφει την πρώτη επαφή του καλλιτέχνη με το χώρο του σε τρισδιάστατο βίντεο .

<p>Η εικαστική αυτή πρόταση έχει ήδη υιοθετηθεί από το Μακεδονικό Μουσείο Σύγχρονης Τέχνης ως ένα εξαιρετικά ενδιαφέρον πείραμα και πρόκειται να εκτεθεί στο χώρο του μουσείου από τις 29 Ιανουαρίου εως 8 Φεβρουαριου. <span>Την καλλιτεχνική επιμέλεια της έκθεσης έχει αναλάβει η ιστορικός τέχνης Θούλη Μυσιρλόγλου.</span></p>
<p><i>Tο συγκεκριμένο εγχείρημα θέτει ουσιαστικά ερωτήματα γύρω από το θέμα κατασκευής του εαυτού, βάζει δηλ. θέματα ταυτότητας σε ένα πλαίσιο πολύ ευρύτερο από τα συμβατικά όρια της σύγχρονης τέχνης. Αν η σύγχρονη τέχνη είναι το όχημα για διαφορετικές εμπειρίες του κόσμου, το project “Home? το μικρό-μικρό σπίτι ” μπορεί να συμβάλει καθοριστικά σ’ αυτή την κατεύθυνση και να εμπλουτίζει το περιβάλλον της σύγχρονης καλλιτεχνικής δημιουργίας και πρόσληψής της</i>.

<h4>Σύντομη περιγραφή της ομάδας και του οράματος<br/>
</h4>
<span> </span>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><i>Μπορεί το διαφορετικό να κραυγάσει την αποδοχή του;<span>  </span></i></p>
<p>Η ομάδα «Εν δυνάμει» αποτελείται από νέους καλλιτέχνες με και χωρίς αναπηρία, που επιθυμούν να παραμείνουν ανήσυχοι, ενεργοί και ευαίσθητοι σε διαρκή μετακίνηση μεταξύ των τεχνών. Μια ζωή εν κινήσει!</p>
<p>Η σύσταση της ομάδας, αυτή η παράδοξη συνεύρεση με ανήσυχο και πολλές φορές επαναστατικό πνεύμα και η απόκλιση από την «κανονικότητα», σε συνδυασμό με το νεαρό της ηλικίας, ακροβατούν ανάμεσα στην πνευματική και σωματική δυνατότητα του καθένα και συνθέτουν μία «τέχνη των εκπλήξεων». Μέσα στην Τέχνη είμαστε όλοι <b>ίσοι,</b></p>
<p><b>Στόχος της ομάδας είναι : </b><br/></p>
<p>μέσα από ανοιχτές συζητήσεις, περφόρμανς, πειραματισμούς με νέα τεχνολογικά μέσα, καλλιτεχνικά εργαστήρια εικαστικών, μουσικής, χορού, θεατρικής έκφρασης, κινηματογράφου, δημιουργικής γραφής, εναλλασσόμενες δράσεις και συνεργασίες με νέους αξιόλογους καλλιτέχνες, <br/></p>
<p><b>να ισχυροποιήσει τη θέση της, ως μια πρωτότυπη πειραματική καλλιτεχνική οντότητα με διεθνή ταυτότητα. </b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h3>
<b>Γιατί χρειαζόμαστε τη βοήθειά σας</b>
</h3>
<p>Το Home ξεκίνησε ως μια συλλογική δημιουργία και εξελίχθηκε μέσα από τη δυναμική  της ομάδας σε κάτι πολύ μεγαλύτερο από αυτό που αρχικά υποψιάστηκαμε κι εμείς οι ίδιοι. Η έκθεση στο Μακεδονικό Μουσείο Σύγχρονής Τέχνης, απαιτεί επιπλέον υλικοτεχνικά μέσα  που δεν έχουμε την οικονομική δυνατότητα να υποστηρίξουμε.<br/></p>

<p>Χρειαζόμαστε να συγκεντρώσουμε 1950 ευρώ για την κάλυψη όλων των εξόδων της έκθεσης. Γι' αυτό ψάχνουμε εναλλακτικούς τρόπους χρηματοδότησης, από ανθρώπους που ενδιαφέρονται για τη δουλειά μας. Η συνεισφορά σου θα βοηθήσει να καταθέσουμε μία καλλιτεχνικά άρτια παραγωγή και θα δημιουργήσει συνθήκες ώστε η ενσωμάτωση του “διαφορετικού” και του “ανοίκειου” να κάνει δημιουργικά την παρουσία του στον χώρο των τεχνών.</p>
<p><b>Αναλυτικά χρειαζόμαστε :</b></p>
<p>600 ευρώ: για αγορά τεχνικού εξοπλισμού για την τρισδιάστατη βιντεοπροβολή των 10 δωματίων, σχεδιασμένα από τους Δημήτρη Ζάχο και τον Μπάμπη Βενετόπουλο, και Οδυσσέα Γκάλιο.</p>
<p>400 ευρώ: για την αγορά ξυλείας και υλικών για τις μακέτες και των ειδικών  κατασκευών στον  εκθεσιακό χώρο, σχεδιασμένα από τους Richard Anthony, Μαρία Καβαλιώτη και Κατερίνα Κολλιοπούλου.</p>
<p>600 ευρώ: για τον κατάλογο που θα συνοδεύει την έκθεση, για τις εκτυπώσεις φωτογραφιών και banner σχεδιασμένα από τον Ιωάννη Εργελετζή.</p>
<p>100 ευρώ: για την μεταφορά της εικαστικής εγκατάστασης στο χώρο του Μακεδονικού Μουσείου Σύγχρονης Τέχνης.</p>

Συλλεκτικές φωτογραφίες, αυθεντικά αντικείμενα από τα δωμάτια, μακέτα από το δωμάτιο των ονείρων σου και ακόμα το ολόδικό σου δωμάτιο σε περίπτωση που το επιθυμείς σε πραγματικό χώρο και σε τρισδιάστατο video installation. </p>

""Το βράδυ το ονειρεύτηκα, το μικρό-μικρό σπίτι, το σπίτι μου. Σαν μία μυρωδιά  που κάπως κάτι σου θυμίζει, εγείρει τη φαντασία και σε αναστατώνει, αλλά και σου προκαλεί αγωνία όπως κάθε καινούργιο και άγνωστο. Ονειρεύτηκα παιδιά που τα σπίτια τους είναι άλλα σπίτια. Που τα παιδιά είναι άλλα παιδιά. Που η φαντασία τους δεν είναι δειλή όπως η δική μου. Που τολμήσανε να κοιμηθούν σε ιπτάμενα χαλιά, να γίνουν ακροβάτες σε κόκκινο τσίρκο. Που γκρεμίσανε τοίχους για να φωλιάσουνε τα άγρια ζώα του δάσους στην κουβέρτα τους. Έτσι, για να μετατρέπεται το φευγιό της φαντασίας σε ύλη.""

Οι Εν δυνάμει ενώ συνεχίζουν την επιτυχημένη πορεία της παράστασης που αγαπήθηκε από κοινό και κριτικούς ""Ο άνθρωπος ανεμιστήρας ή πώς να ντύσετε έναν ελέφαντα"" σε σκηνοθεσία Ελένης Ευθυμίου, δηλώνουν δημιουργικά την παρουσία τους προτείνοντας μια σύγχρονη εικαστική εγκατάσταση 
                                        Home? το μικρό-μικρό σπίτι                                                         
                  Μία ενδελεχής έρευνα πάνω στο ζήτημα του προσωπικού χώρου         
                                      Μακεδονικό Μουσείο Σύγχρονης Τέχνης
                                         29 Ιανουαρίου έως 8 Φεβρουαρίου 

Πού θα ήθελες να ζείς;Πώς είναι ο χώρος των ονείρων σου;Πού αισθάνεσαι ευτυχία, χαρά, αυτοπεποίθηση;Μπορείς να φτιάξεις οτιδήποτε ονειρεύεσαι!
Το μικρό-μικρό σπίτι είναι μια προσπάθεια να προσδιοριστεί ο εαυτός, οι επιθυμίες, τα όνειρα, έξω από το κοινωνικό πλαίσιο που επιβάλλει σε όλους μας τρόπους να βλέπουμε τον εαυτό μας, τις επιθυμίες μας, τα όνειρά μας, το χώρο μας. 



φώτο:Διονύσης Μεταξάς





Εικαστική εγκατάσταση «Home? το μικρό-μικρό σπίτι» 
Επιλέξαμε να εκφραστούμε πρώτα με την εικαστική γλώσσα ώστε να δώσουμε μορφή  στις σκέψεις και στις ιδέες μας. Η εικαστική προσέγγιση σε συνδυασμό με την τεχνολογία αποδείχτηκε απολύτως κατάλληλη για μία νέα βιωματική εξερεύνηση, όπου τα συναισθήματα και οι επιθυμίες των «Εν δυνάμει» καλλιτεχνών δημιουργούν ένα άμεσο διάλογο αντιδράσεων και ερεθισμάτων.  
Στάδιο α 
Ακολουθούμε μια πορεία που περιλαμβάνει προσωπικές συνεντεύξεις των μελών της ομάδας, συζητήσεις, κατασκευή μακέτας και εφαρμογή της σε φυσικό χώρο και μέγεθος ώστε να καταφέρουμε να δημιουργήσουμε μια νέα πραγματικότητα, έναν νέο μικρό-μικρό κόσμο . Οι καλλιτέχνες - δημιουργοί καταθέτουν ιδέες, σκέψεις και κείμενα για το ""σπίτι"" που μέσα σ' αυτό θα ήθελαν να ζουν. 






Στάδιο β
Μετά τη κατασκευή της μακέτας, η δημιουργική ομάδα ετοιμάζει σε πραγματικό χώρο το δωμάτιο ακριβώς όπως το έχει φανταστεί ο κάθε δημιουργός. Η κινηματογραφική ομάδα με ειδικά σχεδιασμένο εξοπλισμό καταγράφει την πρώτη επαφή του καλλιτέχνη με το χώρο του σε τρισδιάστατο βίντεο . Η διαδικασία αυτή τεκμηριώνεται από φωτογραφίες και βίντεο των συμμετεχόντων να ζουν μέσα στο μικρό-μικρό ονειρεμένο τους σπίτι .



Στάδιο γ
Η φωτογραφική ομάδα  επισκέφτηκε περισσότερα από 50 σπίτια και κατέγραψε  λεπτομέρειες που αποτυπώνουν  την «διαφορετικότητα». όπως αυτή εκφράζεται μέσα από τους κατοίκους των σπιτιών και τα προσωπικά τους αντικείμενα Η συλλογή από τις αληθινές ιστορίες ανθρώπων θα αποτελέσει μέρος της έκθεσης που ετοιμάζουμε. Ευχαριστούμε για την εμπιστοσύνη και τη φιλοξενία όλους τους ενοίκους των σπιτιών που φωτογραφήσαμε.



Στάδιο δ
Η εικαστική αυτή πρόταση έχει ήδη υιοθετηθεί από το Μακεδονικό Μουσείο Σύγχρονης Τέχνης ως ένα εξαιρετικά ενδιαφέρον πείραμα και πρόκειται να εκτεθεί στο χώρο του μουσείου από τις 29 Ιανουαρίου εως 8 Φεβρουαριου. Την καλλιτεχνική επιμέλεια της έκθεσης έχει αναλάβει η ιστορικός τέχνης Θούλη Μυσιρλόγλου.
Tο συγκεκριμένο εγχείρημα θέτει ουσιαστικά ερωτήματα γύρω από το θέμα κατασκευής του εαυτού, βάζει δηλ. θέματα ταυτότητας σε ένα πλαίσιο πολύ ευρύτερο από τα συμβατικά όρια της σύγχρονης τέχνης. Αν η σύγχρονη τέχνη είναι το όχημα για διαφορετικές εμπειρίες του κόσμου, το project “Home? το μικρό-μικρό σπίτι ” μπορεί να συμβάλει καθοριστικά σ’ αυτή την κατεύθυνση και να εμπλουτίζει το περιβάλλον της σύγχρονης καλλιτεχνικής δημιουργίας και πρόσληψής της. Θ.Μ.




Σύντομη περιγραφή της ομάδας και του οράματος

 
 
Μπορεί το διαφορετικό να κραυγάσει την αποδοχή του;  
Η ομάδα «Εν δυνάμει» αποτελείται από νέους καλλιτέχνες με και χωρίς αναπηρία, που επιθυμούν να παραμείνουν ανήσυχοι, ενεργοί και ευαίσθητοι σε διαρκή μετακίνηση μεταξύ των τεχνών. Μια ζωή εν κινήσει!
Η σύσταση της ομάδας, αυτή η παράδοξη συνεύρεση με ανήσυχο και πολλές φορές επαναστατικό πνεύμα και η απόκλιση από την «κανονικότητα», σε συνδυασμό με το νεαρό της ηλικίας, ακροβατούν ανάμεσα στην πνευματική και σωματική δυνατότητα του καθένα και συνθέτουν μία «τέχνη των εκπλήξεων». Μέσα στην Τέχνη είμαστε όλοι ίσοι,
Στόχος της ομάδας είναι : 
μέσα από ανοιχτές συζητήσεις, περφόρμανς, πειραματισμούς με νέα τεχνολογικά μέσα, καλλιτεχνικά εργαστήρια εικαστικών, μουσικής, χορού, θεατρικής έκφρασης, κινηματογράφου, δημιουργικής γραφής, εναλλασσόμενες δράσεις και συνεργασίες με νέους αξιόλογους καλλιτέχνες, 
να ισχυροποιήσει τη θέση της, ως μια πρωτότυπη πειραματική καλλιτεχνική οντότητα με διεθνή ταυτότητα. 


Γιατί χρειαζόμαστε τη βοήθειά σας

Το Home ξεκίνησε ως μια συλλογική δημιουργία και εξελίχθηκε μέσα από τη δυναμική  της ομάδας σε κάτι πολύ μεγαλύτερο από αυτό που αρχικά υποψιάστηκαμε κι εμείς οι ίδιοι. Η έκθεση στο Μακεδονικό Μουσείο Σύγχρονής Τέχνης, απαιτεί επιπλέον υλικοτεχνικά μέσα  που δεν έχουμε την οικονομική δυνατότητα να υποστηρίξουμε.






Χρειαζόμαστε να συγκεντρώσουμε 1950 ευρώ για την κάλυψη όλων των εξόδων της έκθεσης. Γι' αυτό ψάχνουμε εναλλακτικούς τρόπους χρηματοδότησης, από ανθρώπους που ενδιαφέρονται για τη δουλειά μας. Η συνεισφορά σου θα βοηθήσει να καταθέσουμε μία καλλιτεχνικά άρτια παραγωγή και θα δημιουργήσει συνθήκες ώστε η ενσωμάτωση του “διαφορετικού” και του “ανοίκειου” να κάνει δημιουργικά την παρουσία του στον χώρο των τεχνών.
Αναλυτικά χρειαζόμαστε :
600 ευρώ: για αγορά τεχνικού εξοπλισμού για την τρισδιάστατη βιντεοπροβολή των 10 δωματίων, σχεδιασμένα από τους Δημήτρη Ζάχο και τον Μπάμπη Βενετόπουλο, και Οδυσσέα Γκάλιο.
400 ευρώ: για την αγορά ξυλείας και υλικών για τις μακέτες και των ειδικών  κατασκευών στον  εκθεσιακό χώρο, σχεδιασμένα από τους Richard Anthony, Μαρία Καβαλιώτη και Κατερίνα Κολλιοπούλου.
600 ευρώ: για τον κατάλογο που θα συνοδεύει την έκθεση, για τις εκτυπώσεις φωτογραφιών και banner σχεδιασμένα από τον Ιωάννη Εργελετζή.
100 ευρώ: για την μεταφορά της εικαστικής εγκατάστασης στο χώρο του Μακεδονικού Μουσείου Σύγχρονης Τέχνης.

περίπου 250 ευρώ για τις κρατήσεις του Indiegogo για την καμπάνια μας. (αναπόφευκτο)

Σε αντάλλαγμα, σου προσφέρουμε συλλεκτικά δώρα από το “μικρό-μικρό “μας σπίτι. Δώρα που αποτυπώνουν στιγμές, από το συλλογικό μας «βίο» . Συλλεκτικές φωτογραφίες, αυθεντικά αντικείμενα από τα δωμάτια, μακέτα από το δωμάτιο των ονείρων σου και ακόμα το ολόδικό σου δωμάτιο σε περίπτωση που το επιθυμείς σε πραγματικό χώρο και σε τρισδιάστατο video installation.

“En Dynamei” are continuing the successful journey of their much beloved play ‘The Fan Man or how to dress an elephant’ directed by Eleni Efthimiou, and  now they are creating a contemporary art installation:
Home? Sweet littlest home
An extensive research on personal space
Macedonian Museum of Contemporary Art (MMCA)
29 January - 8 February 2015
Where would you like to live?
How do you imagine your dream space?
Where do you feel most happiness, joy, confidence?
You can build whatever you dream!

‘Home?-little, little home’ is an attempt to shape our identity, desires and dreams, beyond the bounds of social convention that surround us.




Art installation

With art the medium of exploration and as a mechanism to give shape to thoughts and ideas. In tandem with technology, is proving to be fruitful for a new exploration of life, where the feelings and desires of ‘En Dynamei” members build a direct dialogue of reactions and impulses.
Stage 1

We follow a journey that includes personal interviews with members of the team, creative discussion, the construction of a model and then its transformation into real size in order to create a new reality, a new little, little world. The ‘home’ they dream to live in.


Stage 2

After the construction of the model, the team prepares in real size the room as imagined by each creator. Thanks to specially designed equipment, the film team will record a 3D video of the artist’s first contact with the location and their own personal exploration within. The process is further documented with pictures and videos capturing the participants alive inside the little, little home of their dreams.


Stage 3

The photography group has already visited more than 50 homes, recording details showing the ‘diversity’ as expressed through the inhabitants and their personal belongings. This collection of personal stories forms a facet of the exhibition. We thank all the inhabitants of the homes that we photographed.




Stage 4

This artistic proposal has already been adopted by the MMCA as an extremely interesting experiment and will be on display from 29th January until 8th February 2015. The exhibition is being curated by the art historian, Thouli Mirsirloglou.


Short description of the team and vision

‘En dynamei’ is composed of disabled and non-disabled youth, who together with the creative team strive to be curious, proactive, and in constant dialogue between the arts, and life on the move!
The team’s goal is:

Through open dialogue and research in performance, new technology, craft, music, dance, theatre, film, creative writing and collaborations with new talented artists, En Dynamei aims to strengthen its position as an original experimental art collective with an international identity.

Hi! I'm Michelle Seabreeze - I've been
an actress, dancer, spoken word artist, and commercial model in NYC for
over 10 years. 

Most of my inspiration to follow my dream has come from being a
teaching artist in schools all over the city.


 I try to inspire all of my
students to follow their dreams, so I think it's time I followed my own advice. 

My dream is to live and work in Los Angeles, CA. The amount of funds it will take
to get me there I am simply unable to generate on a teaching artist’s salary - so
I've created an Indiegogo Campaign with the hopes that there are more than a
few generous supporters out there. Thanks for caring everyone, and wish me
luck!
