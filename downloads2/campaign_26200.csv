<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></div>
<div>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Why not another module? </span>The norm has always been to buy a prototyping board and then buy additional boards or sensors to wire them up. This is a lengthy process that takes time, and many things can go wrong. eeMod integrates the most commonly used sensors, so students can focus on the programming and not on wiring problems.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<b>What can I learn with eeMod?</b> eeMod is a versatile tool, but also a learning platform. Students who have the slightest curiosity on programming and want to do cool things with hardware are in for a treat. Starting from programming concepts, to how a program is run on a microcontroller to controlling and manipulating robotic arms; it can all be done using eeMod.<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<b>Is it suitable for kids... and researchers?</b> There's a drastic difference, but yes it can. Reason being that eeMod can be programmed and used in different ways. A young student might program eeMod using Arduino to move the motors with a button click, whilst a researcher might use an FPGA for mesh networking and positioning problems using eeMods hardware.<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<b>How can eeMod be used in research and projects?</b> eeMod was first built for swarm robotics purposes. That means having multiple robots performing a task cohesively. This entails in having lots of on-board functionality on a small package. Besides this, it's a great tool to have during project development and debugging.<br/>

<h1>A short tutorial</h1>
<br/><p></p>
<p>Every user of every board, module or platform that he or she buys asks the same question: ""How do I use it?"" We've proudly built eeMod using the most commonly used sensors out there - all open source. What's more is that our first microcontroller is run using Arduino. That means that there's already a tonne of information on how to program and use the device: <a href=""https://goo.gl/T1ZgRd"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://goo.gl/T1ZgRd</a></p>
<p>So let's assume you're going to start with Arduino. You've downloaded the free IDE, connected eeMod and you're good to go:</p>

<br/><p></p>
<p>Let's say you want to control the motors forward whilst having some LEDs on, what do you write? There are two ways; either use our library, or just go ahead and include the pins that are used to connect to the sensors from the ATmega2560 and write some code to make use of them. Here we show a mixture of both.</p>

<b style=""background-color: initial;"">Who are eeRoots?</b><br/><p>We're a small team with big ambitions. Started over a cup of coffee with good friends, and grew into a company aimed at creating simple, educational, and fun integrated electronic products and services.</p>
<b>What does eeRoots stand for and what does it mean?</b><p>eeRoots is a short word for ""Electrical Engineering Roots"". We chose this name because the idea, design, and core of the products all stem from electronics engineering. Our logo also represents this, showing a tree like structure formed from the ground - pun intended.</p>
<p><b>Why crowd funding and why flexible funding?</b></p>
<p>Crowd Funding is an effective way to get this product to market. Since it's ready to be manufactured, we feel confident to sell it on-line, otherwise we wouldn't. We chose flexible funding in order to allow people who would otherwise have problems contributing with Paypal to contribute. This can only be done with flexible funding.</p>
<b>What is eeMod?</b><p>eeMod is the first and primary product of eeRoots. It is a truly integrated prototyping platform - because unlike other modules, it integrates all the tools, sensors, and functionality on one single platform that's smaller than your fist. We worked especially hard to make it compact, robust, and easy for everyone to use. We chose the most common sensors used by the open-source community, so there's plenty of free resources for everyone to tap into.</p>
<b>What can I do with eeMod?</b><p>This is a vast question, and it deserves a vast answer. eeMod has an on-board controller that can be changed. This means anything that an Arduino or your favorite module can do so can eeMod. The beauty of eeMod is in the integration of features and ease of use. With other modules, you must constantly stay buying a sensor or add-on module, connect wires, or stack multiple boards to include the feature you want in your project, e.g. Wi-Fi. It's a messy, very expensive, and time consuming process...</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
On the other hand, eeMod comes pre-built with over 10 sensors and modules. This enables you to activate and use any sensor or combination of sensors, and is as simple as writing a few lines of code. There are no wires, messy connections or extra costs with eeMod. Talk about bang for buck. One can also learn electronics and how to code using eeMod. We will make clear and easy tutorials for you to follow, starting from a beginner up to an engineer.<p></p>
<b>Can eeMod be used in the classroom?</b><p>Absolutely! Since our primary module is Arduino compatible, it's easy for students to code and see their projects come to life. With loads of information online, compiling notes and materials will be easy.</p>
<b>How can I change the controller?</b><p>The controller can be changed by replacing the Top Module. From our experience, different users often get accustomed to different microcontrollers, but the underlying tools remain the same. So you can either design a PCB with a different microcontroller or buy one that we'll support in the future. Having said that, we installed an ATmega2560 on eeMod - one of the most powerful and widely used Arduino compatible microcontrollers out there, making sure that there's plenty of information and tutorials to start and grow with.</p>
<b>Will there be support and tutorials?</b><p>Definitely. We believe in proper documentation. We understand that as a user, you want tutorials, code to begin with, code to continue with, and code to really get into it. So we'll provide these if the campaign is successful. Having said this, we strongly recommend that you check out Arduino tutorials since much of the information is already available.</p>
<b>Is eeMod safe to use?</b><p>Yes, there can be no harm done from eeMod to a person in any way. This is a prototyping module made for education and fun.</p>
<b>Where and when will eeMod be available?</b><p>eeMod will go through a process of crowd funding in April 2016. After that, it will be in demand on Indiegogo and possibly in different distributors around the world.</p>
<b>Where can eeMod be shipped to?</b><p>We're making eeMod available worldwide, so you'll be able to get it no matter where you are.</p>
<b>Is eeMod certified?</b><p>eeMod has components that use official FCC and CE certifications. eeMod is sold as a kit and is therefore exempted from certain certifications. Although certain certifications are not required for this product, we still abide by ROHS, CE, FCC regulations.</p>

What's the problem we're solving?


We understand that creating circuits on breadboards, stacking boards or wiring up your normal Arduino board to the sensors you want can get messy, complicated and frustrating, especially when something from the electrical side doesn't work. 
We wanted to solve these problems by creating a platform that houses the most commonly used sensors for many different scenarios whilst keeping it simple to use and educational at the same time.

_____________________________________________________________________________


An Integrated Development Platform for Makers, Students and Engineers.
We designed a platform that integrates the maker's favorite sensors, tools and controllers... all without any wires or connections.
Bluetooth 4.0, Wi-Fi, Infrared Sensors, Motor Control, Light Sensors, color Sensor, Compass, Gyro, Accelerometer, SD Card slot and USB on one platform the size of your fist.


The ATmega2560 is installed on the eeMod, so you get the best of Arduino.










It even transforms into a customizable robot...


The platform can even be customized to transform into a robot. Just add two wheels, a ball caster and a battery and you can control it from your smart phone, tablet or PC. Or maybe you want to let it operate autonomously?



Note: The decal is only intended to portray any sticker. Spider-man is the property of Marvel Comics and the sticker is not included with the product.

Customize the 3D printed body!

The body is 3D printed, which means common acrylic paint sticks to eat easily. So do stickers and decals. You can customize it or even 3D print your own body if you want to. Our 3D designs will be available if the campaign is fully funded.
Here are a few cute examples of what you can make them look like :)




_____________________________________________________________________________


Features










We understand that different projects require different processing power. Or maybe you like to work with a certain microcontroller?
Choose from our selection of controllers or design one yourself!
We're currently using the ATmega2560. That means it's Arduino compatible and we ship it that way.



_____________________________________________________________________________
Rewards
We've got something for everyone! We worked hard to decrease the price as much as possible without compromising both the quality and the functionality of eeMod.
We need your help because manufacturing at low quantities skyrockets the price or the product. So production cannot take place without your help. Help us make this happen.

_____________________________________________________________________________
Who is eeMod for?



Want to use it for Projects, Class or Research? Learning or starting from scratch?


Why not another module? The norm has always been to buy a prototyping board and then buy additional boards or sensors to wire them up. This is a lengthy process that takes time, and many things can go wrong. eeMod integrates the most commonly used sensors, so students can focus on the programming and not on wiring problems.


What can I learn with eeMod? eeMod is a versatile tool, but also a learning platform. Students who have the slightest curiosity on programming and want to do cool things with hardware are in for a treat. Starting from programming concepts, to how a program is run on a microcontroller to controlling and manipulating robotic arms; it can all be done using eeMod.



Is it suitable for kids... and researchers? There's a drastic difference, but yes it can. Reason being that eeMod can be programmed and used in different ways. A young student might program eeMod using Arduino to move the motors with a button click, whilst a researcher might use an FPGA for mesh networking and positioning problems using eeMods hardware.



How can eeMod be used in research and projects? eeMod was first built for swarm robotics purposes. That means having multiple robots performing a task cohesively. This entails in having lots of on-board functionality on a small package. Besides this, it's a great tool to have during project development and debugging.

We're currently using eeMod for reliable data logging and research, take a look:

    

_____________________________________________________________________________

Specs



The platform is divided into two parts, the top module and the bottom module.
The top module houses the microcontroller, RGB LED, programming port and extra pins to connect more platforms.
The bottom module has all the sensors, the power supply, USB controller and connectors.




To better understand what eeMod is made of, check out this non-technical system diagram. It includes all the sensors present on the Bottom Module as well as the micro controller present on the Top Module. There's also code to get an idea of what programming looks like. We also wrote a cool tutorial, keep scrolling down for that!






The eeMod-T is designed to be interchangeable, allowing you to upgrade to more powerful controllers without changing the underlying sensors or supply.
             
 Variable Microcontroller/FPGA. ATmega2560.
 RGB LED       Status LEDs      Connecting headers




Custom Controller












You can program eeMod using different programming languages to suit different ages, different difficulties and different levels of detail.
The programming language depends entirely on the controller you choose on the eeMod. We started using a dsPIC and installed an ATmega2560 to make it Arduino compatible for you to use freely and easily. You can design your own Top Board or even expansion modules to add sensors, custom made circuitry or additional hardware capabilities.









The bottom platform of eeMod enables you to access the most commonly used sensors used by the open-source community. No more connecting wires and stacking countless boards.  Convenience on one board.
""We chose the most commonly used sensors by hobbyists, makers and students. Every sensor and line of code is open-source and easily accessible.""







Size


eeMod is small... In fact, it's smaller than your fist.




Technical Specs, Pin-outs and Pin Labeling




Everyone wants good documentation to start with. This is why we included a non-technical system diagram and code for you to really know what's in there and how to use it. We also included signal pin-outs and pin labeling, so you can really get a clear view of how eeMod is constructed and used.

It's that easy. We'll be adding tutorials and code if this campaign is successful, and we can't wait to share it with you!


Here's another full tutorial for you, this one explains how we made part of the video - the part where eeMod is used to turn the cube on the monitor. We think you'll enjoy this one.

We worked especially hard to make it compact, robust, and easy for everyone to use. We chose the most common sensors used by the open-source community, so there's plenty of free resources for everyone to tap into.
What can I do with eeMod?This is a vast question, and it deserves a vast answer. eeMod has an on-board controller that can be changed. This means anything that an Arduino or your favorite module can do so can eeMod. The beauty of eeMod is in the integration of features and ease of use. With other modules, you must constantly stay buying a sensor or add-on module, connect wires, or stack multiple boards to include the feature you want in your project, e.g. Wi-Fi. It's a messy, very expensive, and time consuming process...


On the other hand, eeMod comes pre-built with over 10 sensors and modules. This enables you to activate and use any sensor or combination of sensors, and is as simple as writing a few lines of code. There are no wires, messy connections or extra costs with eeMod. Talk about bang for buck. One can also learn electronics and how to code using eeMod. We will make clear and easy tutorials for you to follow, starting from a beginner up to an engineer.
Can eeMod be used in the classroom?Absolutely! Since our primary module is Arduino compatible, it's easy for students to code and see their projects come to life. With loads of information online, compiling notes and materials will be easy.
How can I change the controller?The controller can be changed by replacing the Top Module. From our experience, different users often get accustomed to different microcontrollers, but the underlying tools remain the same. So you can either design a PCB with a different microcontroller or buy one that we'll support in the future. Having said that, we installed an ATmega2560 on eeMod - one of the most powerful and widely used Arduino compatible microcontrollers out there, making sure that there's plenty of information and tutorials to start and grow with.
Will there be support and tutorials?Definitely. We believe in proper documentation. We understand that as a user, you want tutorials, code to begin with, code to continue with, and code to really get into it. So we'll provide these if the campaign is successful. Having said this, we strongly recommend that you check out Arduino tutorials since much of the information is already available.
Is eeMod safe to use?Yes, there can be no harm done from eeMod to a person in any way. This is a prototyping module made for education and fun.
Where and when will eeMod be available?eeMod will go through a process of crowd funding in April 2016. After that, it will be in demand on Indiegogo and possibly in different distributors around the world.
Where can eeMod be shipped to?We're making eeMod available worldwide, so you'll be able to get it no matter where you are.
Is eeMod certified?eeMod has components that use official FCC and CE certifications. eeMod is sold as a kit and is therefore exempted from certain certifications. Although certain certifications are not required for this product, we still abide by ROHS, CE, FCC regulations.

<h4>Personal Life</h4>
<p>Along the course of my little achievements, I was blessed with a daughter who means the World to me. I need to be self-employed because she lives 13,278 kms (8250.5 mi) away from me in the Philippines. Every year, I try to see her for about 2 weeks to a month, so holding a full-time employment is not feasible. To cut on cost, I sometimes travel with many stopovers, between 24 to 31 hours to get to her. I would love nothing more than to see her multiple times a year, or hopefully someday be able to bring her to Canada as well. In the meantime<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">, I am growing a business that can help finance my yearly trip.</span></p>

<h4>Dilemma</h4>
<p>The $1,600 tuition for the program is absolutely worth every bit of hard work I put in to earn the fund. But that same amount is also the approximate amount it will take for me to see my daughter in the Philippines. I am hoping that with a sufficient amount of help, I can do both. :)</p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">By far, the profits from my business have been constantly put back into buying new, necessary equipment for my craft. Almost 3 years later, I am confident in saying now that I have all the necessary tools and knowledge of the trade. Along the way, I do make it a point to travel to various places in North America and along the Pacific (on my way to see my daughter), to attend photography workshops and diversify my portfolio. When budget permits, I also try to bring a team for mutual learning. </span></p>
<p>Since starting my business in 2012, I have been nothing but frugal, constantly trying to budget my spendings to things that can potentially further my abilities and have a decent return on investment.

My name is Maria Belano. I was born in the Philippines. My parents did a fantastic job in ensuring my constant lust for education, as well as my desire for constant advancement, so we relocated frequently. At 4 years old, my parents took me to Brunei where I started in the British educational system. 
At 12, my Architect mother taught me Photoshop 7.0. 
At 16, I relocated to the Philippines to formally attended school for Multimedia Arts.
At 17, with an overall average of 97%, I was put on my university's President's List.
At 18, I was named Best Director of a short-film called ""Fall"", for a film festival held for our program, and earned a chance to be an apprentice director on-set for ABS-CBN with Director Paolo Villaluna.
At 19, I worked on my first published commissions for an events company in the Philippines, and also earned a Special Citation from the UNFPA Philippines for a short animation called ""Si Leo ang Batang Lito"" (Leo, the confused child).
At 19, we moved to Canada and started my first job as a design artist at a print shop in Windsor, while attending school for Business Admin at the University of Windsor. 
At 22, I moved to Toronto and started my first (miniature) business as a photographer, graphic designer and web master. 
At 23, I took a Book-keeping course at McMaster University.
At 24, I moved for a year to Windsor and started a Photo Booth company. 
And now, before I turn 25, I applied and got accepted into Nick Knight's prestigious talent program, selected among 9,631 other potential candidates.


Personal Life
Along the course of my little achievements, I was blessed with a daughter who means the World to me. I need to be self-employed because she lives 13,278 kms (8250.5 mi) away from me in the Philippines. Every year, I try to see her for about 2 weeks to a month, so holding a full-time employment is not feasible.

In the meantime, I am growing a business that can help finance my yearly trip.

The $1,600 tuition for the program is absolutely worth every bit of hard work I put in to earn the fund. But that same amount is also the approximate amount it will take for me to see my daughter in the Philippines. I am hoping that with a sufficient amount of help, I can do both. :)
Shop Talk
By far, the profits from my business have been constantly put back into buying new, necessary equipment for my craft.

Almost two years ago, I came to UCLA and chose to major in Political Science and International Relations. Now I’m a full time student with a work-study job, a part-time job and an internship. And yet somehow, that’s still not enough to cover a 4 month study abroad in Paris! That's why I've turned to Indiegogo and try to raise money to put towards housing and tuition and other travel expenses which adds up to about $14,000. More specific information about my program can be found <a href=""http://eap.ucop.edu/OurPrograms/france/Pages/political_science_sciences_po.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. </p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">You see, I’m aiming for the big leagues - I’m going to be a diplomat or ambassador, ideally one to France. That’s why, as soon as I learned of this opportunity to study at a top Political Science University in Paris - Sciences Po - I didn’t think twice. But a</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">s you can see, I finally had to get around to the thinking twice part. </span></p>
<p>When I got to 9th grade, I had to pick my “second” language. Of course, for me it was my sixth and maybe final so I had to chose wisely. I chose French. What I didn’t know was how hard it would be to retain it. Time passed, I went to college, studied hard, got a job, and then a second, and then a third and almost two years went by where no matter how hard I tried, there just wasn’t enough time for French maintenance. However, I am not ready to give up on it or on the four long years I spent on learning it just yet! I So I figured my best bet is the most drastic one - actually moving to France! Even more exciting is that <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I will be studying in my own field at a top Political Science University. It is honestly a dream combination - an incredible opportunity to experience European politics while mastering French. Not to mention learning from a </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">completely new perspective, destroying any tunnel vision I might have from living and studying in the same place for too long. </span></p>I have already made a promise to myself that from the minute I land in Paris, I will not speak a word of English. My people back home can use Google translate. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I will carry baguettes under my arm. I will take the subway everywhere.

</div></div>","Hello world!!! (Hopefully..) My name is Sally and I'm a second year college student from Los Angeles. Almost two years ago, I came to UCLA and chose to major in Political Science and International Relations. Now I’m a full time student with a work-study job, a part-time job and an internship. And yet somehow, that’s still not enough to cover a 4 month study abroad in Paris! That's why I've turned to Indiegogo and try to raise money to put towards housing and tuition and other travel expenses which adds up to about $14,000. More specific information about my program can be found here. You see, I’m aiming for the big leagues - I’m going to be a diplomat or ambassador, ideally one to France. That’s why, as soon as I learned of this opportunity to study at a top Political Science University in Paris - Sciences Po - I didn’t think twice. But as you can see, I finally had to get around to the thinking twice part. 
When I got to 9th grade, I had to pick my “second” language. Of course, for me it was my sixth and maybe final so I had to chose wisely. I chose French. What I didn’t know was how hard it would be to retain it. Time passed, I went to college, studied hard, got a job, and then a second, and then a third and almost two years went by where no matter how hard I tried, there just wasn’t enough time for French maintenance. However, I am not ready to give up on it or on the four long years I spent on learning it just yet! I So I figured my best bet is the most drastic one - actually moving to France! Even more exciting is that I will be studying in my own field at a top Political Science University. It is honestly a dream combination - an incredible opportunity to experience European politics while mastering French. Not to mention learning from a completely new perspective, destroying any tunnel vision I might have from living and studying in the same place for too long. I have already made a promise to myself that from the minute I land in Paris, I will not speak a word of English. My people back home can use Google translate. I will carry baguettes under my arm. I will take the subway everywhere. I will eat croissants for breakfast and crepes for dinner. I will wear stripes and a beret and ignore the sneers I get. I will literally become a French citizen. I will do all of this, and I will come back speaking French so well, you will have to excuse it. I am very excited about what Paris has to offer! All I need is a little boost to get there. If you'd like to know more about me or my trip, I'm just a click away! :)

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Help Us Build Each-One-Teach-One</b></h2><p>The goal of Each-One-Teach-One is to make an impact on education in the best way possible, which is to teach reading and English. We hope to encourage people like you to become  tutors/instructors. As tutors, you can teach your family members. As instructors, you can train tutors who will help out their communities. The tutors can start by teaching basic reading and English skills. We are not talking about rocket science. This is early reading skills for four, five, and six year old students. All tutors have to do is teach the alphabet and phonetic alphabet. That is all it takes to get started. After that, give the students an assignment; they will start sounding out words and learning vocabulary on their own using the workbook. The basic reading foundation takes only a few hours to learn and teach.</p><p></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">
<b> Illiteracy Rate in the </b><b>United States</b>
</h3><p>About 20% of the adult population is functionally illiterate, which is about 40 million people. Another 20% reads well enough to get by. This mirrors the statistic that 40% of fourth grade students read at below grade level. Most of the adults are working minimum wage jobs or they are unemployed. Those unemployed people have time to learn to read and then teach reading.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></p><h4>Many children fall behind and never catch up.

If you can read English, you can help others learn to read. You can start your own reading program! You only need three or four students to begin and a few family members volunteering as tutors. Start helping the children of family members, then help friends. The only curriculum you will need is ""Phonetic English."" </p><p><b>When you teach adults the basic skills, get a pledge from them. Make them promise to teach at least one other person to read.</b><br/></p><p>Phonetic English is the most advanced language skills program in the world.

We hope to encourage people like you to become  tutors/instructors. As tutors, you can teach your family members. As instructors, you can train tutors who will help out their communities. The tutors can start by teaching basic reading and English skills. We are not talking about rocket science. This is early reading skills for four, five, and six year old students. All tutors have to do is teach the alphabet and phonetic alphabet. That is all it takes to get started. After that, give the students an assignment; they will start sounding out words and learning vocabulary on their own using the workbook. The basic reading foundation takes only a few hours to learn and teach.
 Illiteracy Rate in the United States
About 20% of the adult population is functionally illiterate, which is about 40 million people. Another 20% reads well enough to get by. This mirrors the statistic that 40% of fourth grade students read at below grade level. Most of the adults are working minimum wage jobs or they are unemployed. Those unemployed people have time to learn to read and then teach reading. Many children fall behind and never catch up. Teachers can't take the time to help them get caught up using tutoring, but you can!+++++++++++++++++++++Help Your Family and CommunityIt makes no difference if you are a nurse in Mississippi, bookkeeper in New York, or a high school student in Africa. If you can read English, you can help others learn to read. You can start your own reading program! You only need three or four students to begin and a few family members volunteering as tutors. Start helping the children of family members, then help friends. The only curriculum you will need is ""Phonetic English."" When you teach adults the basic skills, get a pledge from them. Make them promise to teach at least one other person to read.Phonetic English is the most advanced language skills program in the world. Native English speakers can learn to teach basic reading skills in twenty-four to forty-eight hours. English language learners can learn to read and speak English in a few weeks.Help Us Reach Our Goal $1 at a TimeOur standard PDF ebook perk  is $10. The other ebooks are $20.

Diversity Multicultural Channel is a web TV/Radio
station established to serve the needs of the ever
growing migrant population in the Republic of Ireland to promote community and
social integration, Social development and empowerment by bringing together
Ireland's new communities to engage, debates on social, immigration and political
and other issues concerning and affecting migrant people from across the globe
who now call Ireland home. DTV platform has offerings of local integrated
range of audience engagement opportunities to all members of ethnic minority
communities across Ireland.




Multicultural Television Station in Ireland 

   

What We Need & 

This is the first leg of our campaign and We need to raise $55,000 to get all the
things we need to set up and running. Roughly half of the amount will go toward
purchasing quality equipment like cameras,
editing software, etc. While the other half
will fund a part-time technician with expertise in video recording and editing, hire
creative talents, music and licensing, insurance, set design, mobile
app, and more importantly we want a studio space.
BUT, these costs money, that's where you come in! Join us in our
campaign and help us reach our goal otherwise this
project will struggle to get off the ground. 
However, if we don't reach our goal at the end of
this campaign, any funds raised will go toward studio hire and getting basic
equipment to begin production of a few shows while we plan a second phase of
funding exercise. But If we get super-duper lucky and exceed this goal amount!
Then, Hallelujah! Extra funds will go towards organising training workshops
for migrant women and youth. Please see Migrant Media Funds section on our
website.
A small contribution from you can go a long way in helping us meet
our funding goal. Donate Now At Any Level in the Right Hand Column to
Support DTV. You will be helping to launch a
project that will change the media landscape in Ireland for ever! A project aiming
to promote integration and inclusion and empowerment to migrant people in Ireland!

appreciate your donation regardless of amount. To show our appreciation we

The Impact

how important your support is to the future of ethnic minority media
practices in Ireland.More importantly, Ireland not

We hope to continue this project until these children graduate from High school to be able to apply for vocational training, higher education, and jobs. We expect continuous support from you all. Thank you all again. - Suraj Bhattarai, Chris Gibson and Rotary Katy/Rotaract WH Katy familySTORIES FROM THE GROUND""During our Earthquake relief mission in Thulosirubari VDC, Sindhupalchowk, we met these 2 children, raised by their father after they lost their mother nearly a decade ago. Unfortunately, their father also lost his life in the recent Earthquake making their life a series of misery. They are now been taken care by their uncle who is financial weak and already has 6 children of his own. They have no shelter either."" Dr. Prabhat Sapkota, one of our local partners from B.P. Koirala Institute of Health Sciences Nepal and a medical doctor involved in the relief mission, shared his experiences from Sindhupalchowk, the district with more than 4,000 deaths.  We would like to disburse a part of our fund for the rehabilitation of these 2 children.Ramita Rokka, 12, and Anil Rokka, 10, from Thulosirubari, Sindhupalchowk district, have been orphaned by the Earthquake.

NEPAL'S TRAGEDY 2015 IN FIGURES Two major Earthquakes, 7.9 and 7.3 Magnitudes, followed by hundreds of aftershocks rocked Central Nepal in April and May 2015, taking lives of more than 8,500 people and injuring over 20,000 people. Authorities say that the hardest hit areas of Sindhupalchowk, Dolakha, Gorkha, Rasuwa, Nuwakot, Dhading and Kathmandu districts might take years to recover.According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, more than 400,000 houses are damaged or destructed and over 8 Million people have been directly affected. Thousands of children have been orphaned by this terrible Earthquake and scores have been disabled. UNICEF reports that more than 5,000 schools have been damaged or destroyed and over 1 Million students are without classrooms. More reports and data are yet to come.UNICEF facts about NepalQuake 2015Nepalese friends in Netherlands have prepared this video to show how Nepal looked before the Earthquake and what it looks in its aftermath. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oklS38fD59A PLEA FOR YOUR HELP

Girl Scout group of Duchesne Academy of the Sacred Heart, Houston Texas, learned about Volunteerism from Dr. Suraj Bhattarai. This year, their 'Scout Action Project' includes 'Earthquakes in Nepal'. For this, girls have been raising funds and collecting relief materials to support underprivileged children in Nepal.
We hope you will join our campaign to uplift the lives of underprivileged and unfortunate children in Nepal. Only with your valuable support, there can be an immediate and sustainable impact.

My story has inspired many, unfortunately, it is not reflective of the larger student population in my native country---where even the most capable student is shut out of education. </p>
<p>The earthquake that struck in April was devastating for every family across Nepal, thousands of lives were lost and our country sunk deeper as one of the poorest countries in the world, especially the district that I grew up in, Humla, which is now the poorest district in Nepal. There are no roads, transportation or electricity and my family and neighbors still struggle to find jobs, health services and of course, access to education.</p>
<p>I was blessed enough to escape this tough reality that many of my friends and family members still face because I was given an opportunity to pursue my education in international schools and now university in America because of my godparents who have supported me since I was five. Nevertheless, to me, it is heartbreaking that not all children can be as lucky as I am.</p>
<p>Someone I love dearly still struggles to find access to higher education, my sister Sapura Shahi. Through much sacrifice and support from my family, she recently passed her SLC (School Leaving Certificate,) she scored a B. Her work is all the more notable to me and my parents as for someone from a poor and disregarded district as Humla is, to pass the SLC is a huge accomplishment. I immediately expressed the joy for her when I heard the news. I was beyond happy and excited that she would be able to attend college, beating all odds by being the only girl from our village to make such stride.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not all was good news; a week later I got a phone call from my parents who explained how they were unable to pay for my sister’s education. In my village, this would not be out of the normal, the circumstances and lack of money pressure young girls to forgo their chance at an education—forced to marry at a young age. The truth is that most will end up working in the fields, herding cattle, collecting firewood, cooking and performing an endless list of chores, daily.</p>
<p>I do not want all of my sister’s hard-work to be thrown away, it would devastate me to see her potential be wasted. Sapura dreams of continuing her education to become a nurse, she shares with me hopes of one day being able to help others. She is asking for a chance at a better life and I promised my sister that she will go to school and her dreams and hopes will become a reality</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.worldvision.org/sites/default/files/pdf/Gender-Equality-Study-2014-Executive-Summary.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Research</a> shows that increased access to education for girls equals progress on reducing gender-based violence, early marriage, and other harmful practices---furthermore, education increases participation by women and girls in their community, decision making and makes for a happier and more fulfilling life.</p>
<p>Education can change the lives of people for good, especially the lives of young girls like my sister. I do believe that helping my sister obtain an education will send a strong statement to others and will create rippling effects, encouraging many to continue their education.</p>
<p>I promised my sister that I would help her realize her dream of an education and I can only do that with your help. Your donation will change my sister’s life and the lives of many around her. Please help me fulfill this promise by donating, together we can make my sister’s dream a reality.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h1>The Impact</h1><div>
<p>Sapura wants to become a nurse with the clear goal of coming
back to her village to help the injured and provide basic health training for
others. Especially after the earthquake, basic needs became even more difficult to fulfill and people are dying as result of small infections because there is no immediate treatment provided. The village of Karanga is in a remote zone in the top of the mountains and the closest health center is
located seven hours away, as result of that many die waiting for medical attention. </p>
<p>Sapura has always had the passion of helping others and she feels deeply about helping her village overcome otherwise small infections from taking lives. </p>
<p>#Onenurse in the village would drastically improve the lives of many. </p>

Education can change the lives of people for good, especially the lives of young girls like my sister. I do believe that helping my sister obtain an education will send a strong statement to others and will create rippling effects, encouraging many to continue their education.
I promised my sister that I would help her realize her dream of an education and I can only do that with your help. Your donation will change my sister’s life and the lives of many around her. Please help me fulfill this promise by donating, together we can make my sister’s dream a reality.The Impact
Sapura wants to become a nurse with the clear goal of coming
back to her village to help the injured and provide basic health training for
others. Especially after the earthquake, basic needs became even more difficult to fulfill and people are dying as result of small infections because there is no immediate treatment provided. The village of Karanga is in a remote zone in the top of the mountains and the closest health center is
located seven hours away, as result of that many die waiting for medical attention. 
Sapura has always had the passion of helping others and she feels deeply about helping her village overcome otherwise small infections from taking lives. 
#Onenurse in the village would drastically improve the lives of many. 

How the money will be used100% of your donation will go to support Sapura during
the entire program she needs to become a nurse.

Quick question. If it takes 2 days to build one Wall O Books, how many days would it take to build 100? 200 days? 50 days? We got you! 



It takes just 2 days. What it takes is also a team that can get this figured. Well, it took us about three months to figure that out! We are a hybrid Not For Profit Foundation with a strong full time team. Men and women. Engineers and MBAs. Young and Old. Indians. And even a Canadian.

How you can help?
----------
Thank you for reading our story so far. As we wrote right in the beginning, we need your help to build 900 out of our target of 1000 Wall O Books this year. We have built 26 so far and we can build 100 on our own. We are on a mission to build a total of 2900 Wall O Books in India, 100 in each state, covering a total of 290,000 children in the next three years.
We are looking for contributions in four categories - $5 helps to buy a book and hundred smiles, $25 helps create a Pocket O Books with 5 - 12 books inside, $125 creates a full Wall O Books with 9 pockets and 100 books and finally, $500 helps to run it for a full year. 
We have kept our best perk for a $5 contribution. 
If you choose to do this, you will receive the complete Wall O Books Design Kit so that you can build your own Wall O Books for vulnerable children in your city. We will guide you through the process and extend to you our relationships with publishers who love us and give us special discounts for books. 
We have kept it this way so that we can trigger a large and open movement around our idea to build a simple, hyper-cool library of 100 books for children around the world.
Let your friends know for all we need is $5 to make it happen.

</div></div>","HELLO SUPPORTERS & VISIONARIES!ABOUT -- TERRA BABEL is 501c3 Approved Non Profit initiative that engages indigenous communities, the world's oldest remaining cultures in danger of extinction, to participate in the process of their own preservation, giving them a VOICE  though Creative Expression in the universal language of Art & Photography. My name is Paul L. R. Du Bois and I am the founder of the L. R. Du Bois Foundation and creator for the TERRA BABEL PROJECT. This project will benefit not only the people in ancient communities in our world, who are in desperate need of assistance, but all of us for generations to come. As a Creative Director I was privileged to work with award-winning international agencies, and as Artist & Explorer, the gift to journey across borders and explore the magic we, as a people, express in the form of our imagination.  It is through our collective limitless imagination that I invite you to take a journey that is going to change our world : I would like you to ask yourselves one simple question --""If you were the last of your People, what would your Legacy be? ""WHY THESE CULTURES NEEED YOUR HELP -- The oldest remaining cultures in our planet are suffering nothing short than cultural genocide, affecting all of humanity, due to unregulated progress. The fact that the majority of the people in our world are unaware of the existence of these ancient peoples and their cultural realities, make them vulnerable. This recklesness opens the door to abuse through human rights violations, much of which is unaddressed by the world today. 

Families, children and whole communities are often displaced from their ancestral homes, their way of life destroyed, and their history | our history | exterminated in the process.



THE LAUCH OF THE PROJECT--
ARTISTS & CULTURES UNITE TO CREATE A NEW VISUAL LANGUAGE, GIVING A VOICE TO THOSE THAT HAVE NONE, AS THEY SHOW US NEW WORLDS.
For our launch, we will journey to TWO of the world's oldest cultures in danger of extinction :MAORI of New Zealand & Q'ERO Shamans of Peru. 

Art works will be created by the members of the disappearing indigenous communities, together with a team made of impactful artists, showing us their VOICE in the form of various of Artistic Platforms, portraying their incredible unseen CREATIVITY,  which will show the world the cultural & social challenges they face, as well as the beauty of the origins -- humanity's cultural heritage.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The ability to write computer programs and build robots is
an important part of literacy in today’s society. Young people learn strategies
for solving problems, designing projects and communicating ideas in the process
of carrying out a robotics project.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Robotics is a fascinating way to help kids learn to think
creatively, reason systematically and work collaboratively. In the future, not
knowing the language of computers will be as challenging as being an illiterate
today.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Will every job in the future involve programming? No. But it
is still crucial that every child learns to code.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This is not primarily about equipping the next generation to
work as robotics engineers; it is about promoting computational thinking.
Computational thinking is how software engineers solve problems. It combines
mathematics, logic and algorithms, and teaches kids a new way to think about
the world.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nigeria </a>is blessed with a huge youthful population. Over 60%
of the 170 million Nigerians are under the age of 35. The major criterion for a
great future for the country is sound education for its kids and youths.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Today, high school education in Nigeria is more about
memorizing of academic materials to pass exams. The goal of most school owners
is to make students pass WASSCE (West African Secondary School Certificate
Examinations) in flying colours. You can’t create innovators and problems
solvers that way.</p>
<p>As important and brilliant as robotics and coding is to the
education of our kids. It is still an out-of-the-world thing in Nigeria.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Less than 1% of high schools in Nigeria teach coding or
robotics. Most school principals don’t even know what coding/robotics is.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Our intention is to champion the beginning of a great
paradigm in the Nigerian education system. We want to expose our young students
to real-world engineering challenges through hands-on LEGO-based robotics
projects. We want Nigerian kids to begin to think creatively and innovate like
their international counterparts. </b></p>

quite a number of things:</p>
<p><b>1.  </b><b>LEGO Robotics Kit: </b></p>
<p>We want every 6 students we train to have a

<p><b>2.  </b><b>Transportation: </b></p>
<p>Our undergraduate instructors would be
transported to schools in Ibadan, Lagos, Abeokuta, Ife, Akure and Osogbo from Obafemi
Awolowo University, Ife and University of Ibadan campuses on a daily basis.
That is 32 instructors daily (see the illustrations above).</p>
<p><b>3.  </b><b>T-shirts for students and instructors:</b></p>
<p>We would be giving each of the 10,000 kids

The ability to write computer programs and build robots is
an important part of literacy in today’s society. Young people learn strategies
for solving problems, designing projects and communicating ideas in the process
of carrying out a robotics project.
Robotics is a fascinating way to help kids learn to think
creatively, reason systematically and work collaboratively. In the future, not
knowing the language of computers will be as challenging as being an illiterate
today.
Will every job in the future involve programming? No. But it
is still crucial that every child learns to code.
This is not primarily about equipping the next generation to
work as robotics engineers; it is about promoting computational thinking.
Computational thinking is how software engineers solve problems. It combines
mathematics, logic and algorithms, and teaches kids a new way to think about
the world.




Why Nigeria?

Nigeria is blessed with a huge youthful population. Over 60%
of the 170 million Nigerians are under the age of 35. The major criterion for a
great future for the country is sound education for its kids and youths.
Today, high school education in Nigeria is more about
memorizing of academic materials to pass exams. The goal of most school owners
is to make students pass WASSCE (West African Secondary School Certificate
Examinations) in flying colours. You can’t create innovators and problems
solvers that way.
As important and brilliant as robotics and coding is to the
education of our kids. It is still an out-of-the-world thing in Nigeria.
Less than 1% of high schools in Nigeria teach coding or
robotics. Most school principals don’t even know what coding/robotics is.
Our intention is to champion the beginning of a great
paradigm in the Nigerian education system. We want to expose our young students
to real-world engineering challenges through hands-on LEGO-based robotics
projects. We want Nigerian kids to begin to think creatively and innovate like
their international counterparts. 




   Why now?

The Nigerian educational system has been neglected for so
many years. The country has a huge population of unchallenged youths. If we
don’t fix it NOW, then WHEN?




This project is scheduled to start in September 2015 through
April 2016.








How many schools?

200 secondary schools across 6 Nigerian cities: Lagos,
Ibadan, Osogbo, Akure, Ile-Ife, Abeokuta. Presently, we have invited 53 schools to be part of the project. The remaining 147 schools will be invited in September 2015.As part of the project, we would be training 80 girls at the
Women’s Technology Empowerment Center (W-TEC), Yaba Lagos, 50 kids at Kids and Teens Resource Center, Akure, and 100 kids at 2 orphanages in Lagos.
How many kids per school?

We are training 50 kids per secondary school. Kids between
ages 10 and 14.How many instructors are we using per school?4 ACI robotics instructors per school. 

How many instructors in all?

We would be using about 800 instructors for the whole
project. Presently we have 200 instructors on ground. Among them are former
FirstStep BootCamp students in Obafemi Awolowo University and University of Ibadan, and undergraduate robotics engineers at iLab, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, who have represented Nigeria in the World Robotics Olympiad (WRO) in Indonesia. We intend to train more instructors during the
course of the project.
How long per school?

Our robotics instructors would visit each school 4 times.
Each class (visit) would be for 3 hours.










How are we going to spend the money?

We are training 10,000 Nigerian kids in robotics. Intensive
classes! This is a huge project. Every dollar contributed would be going into
quite a number of things:
1.  LEGO Robotics Kit: 
We want every 6 students we train to have a
FULL robotics kit to themselves during the program.
2.  Transportation: 
Our undergraduate instructors would be
transported to schools in Ibadan, Lagos, Abeokuta, Ife, Akure and Osogbo from Obafemi
Awolowo University, Ife and University of Ibadan campuses on a daily basis.
That is 32 instructors daily (see the illustrations above).
3.  T-shirts for students and instructors:
We would be giving each of the 10,000 kids
a i-can-build-a-robot T-shirt each. From experience, kids love the T-shirt.
4.  Lunch allowance for the instructors:
All our 800 undergraduate instructors would
be taking part in the project on a volunteering basis. We are not paying them. A
snack and drink won’t be a bad idea!
5.  Logistics










#Project10000kids is a very huge program
that will have a lasting impact in the Nigerian education system. This is
because it will be taking place in 6 major cities (in 5 states) in South-western
Nigerian. This would surely have a ripple effect across the country.
The termly robotics competition (starting
from December 2015) would ensure continuous robotics research and learning within

For the first time in a country of over 170
million people, robotics would be taught in average and below average Nigerian high
schools for FREE.
With our partnership with iLab, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, National Instruments and Enactus International we believe we can make this a huge success in Nigeria.

the money should go to the Greek people, we were simply astonished (over
100.000 people in just 7 days!) and at the same time inspired on how much
everyone wanted to help us! After that we decided to make a new campaign which will not
be fixed funding.<br/></p>

funding (meaning that if the required goal of 1.6 billion is not reached in time  then it gets refunded in full), and it has not achieved even 5% of that. (It
got refunded by now), hopefully we can make it and help the people as they deserve!<br/></p>
<p>The donations acquired in this campaign will go to:</p>
<p>50% will go
to the National Pension Fund (IKA) which is empty and this month allot (up to 25% of
pensions where not paid due to “paper problems, but we all know why”) (Once
money is there it cant be spent anywhere else, it will be a donation from the
People around the globe represented by this campaign)</p>
<p>50% will go
into donating to local charity organizations that have been giving out food,
clothing and medicine for free for the donated money (such as Stasi Zois,

</p><p><b>Who is GIBRON or Qui Etes-Vous M. Shepperd?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Hello, my name is Gibron Shepperd and
GIBRON is my namesake lifestyle-clothing brand.<span>  </span>The line is about
paradoxes; an aesthetic I call bourgeois bohemian.<span>  </span>A design world that is one part glossy, sophisticated, artifice
and one part honesty and nature.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was born with an affinity for
fabrics and composing a story through them.<span>  As a young child I wanted to be an artist, often finding
myself drawing women in clothes and making accessories like origami earrings
and bags out of paper.  All through
middle school and high school, I created small businesses from baked goods to apothecary.  By the end of high school I decided I
wanted to dedicate myself wholly to fashion design. I studied fashion design and small business management at
West Valley College in Northern California for two years.  Everyday since graduating high school,
I have dreamed of this brand, and it’s finally time to make it a reality!</span></p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-height=""719"" data-src=""http://40.media.tumblr.com/feeb568f096fade4fa1b3105a5f1c13f/tumblr_nbo66bg3hc1qagh17o1_1280.png"" data-width=""825"" src="""" style=""width: 580.124px; height: 505px;""/><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>What We Do &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>With your help I hope to
raise $75,000, a very small amount for a multi-category start up fashion brand.<span>  In addition to the GIBRON clothing
line, within the first year we plan to have home fragrances, a line of natural
beauty products, and leather goods. 
Having multiple categories allows clients to access facets of GIBRON
through various price points: meaning that individuals that cant afford the
$750 coat can still have a piece of the brand by purchasing a $10 lip butter. </span></p>
<p>Nearly 50% of funding will
go to fabrics and supplies, 25% will go to business fees, marketing, and
miscellaneous expenses like models and studio upkeep and the last 25% is a year’s
stipend.<span>  If you have questions on the
specifics of my business plan or budget, feel free to contact me.  </span></p>
<p>Once funds have amassed,
production will begin<b>!<span>  </span></b>We will start with a small holiday collection
that will be presented at Renegade Craft Fair.  A spring collection and the beginning of a basics line, from
which customers can always order classic pieces, will follow this.  </p>
<p>For your gracious donations you will receive the
perks listed on the side of the screen.</p>

Hello, my name is Gibron Shepperd and
GIBRON is my namesake lifestyle-clothing brand.  The line is about
paradoxes; an aesthetic I call bourgeois bohemian.  A design world that is one part glossy, sophisticated, artifice
and one part honesty and nature.

I was born with an affinity for
fabrics and composing a story through them.  As a young child I wanted to be an artist, often finding
myself drawing women in clothes and making accessories like origami earrings
and bags out of paper.  All through
middle school and high school, I created small businesses from baked goods to apothecary.  By the end of high school I decided I
wanted to dedicate myself wholly to fashion design. I studied fashion design and small business management at
West Valley College in Northern California for two years.  Everyday since graduating high school,
I have dreamed of this brand, and it’s finally time to make it a reality!
What We Do & What You Get

With your help I hope to
raise $75,000, a very small amount for a multi-category start up fashion brand.  In addition to the GIBRON clothing
line, within the first year we plan to have home fragrances, a line of natural
beauty products, and leather goods. 
Having multiple categories allows clients to access facets of GIBRON
through various price points: meaning that individuals that cant afford the
$750 coat can still have a piece of the brand by purchasing a $10 lip butter. 
Nearly 50% of funding will
go to fabrics and supplies, 25% will go to business fees, marketing, and
miscellaneous expenses like models and studio upkeep and the last 25% is a year’s
stipend.  If you have questions on the
specifics of my business plan or budget, feel free to contact me.  
Once funds have amassed,
production will begin!  We will start with a small holiday collection
that will be presented at Renegade Craft Fair.  A spring collection and the beginning of a basics line, from
which customers can always order classic pieces, will follow this.  
For your gracious donations you will receive the
perks listed on the side of the screen.

Your Impact on Us

The greatest challenge with
the development of Gibron has been the lack of time I could devote to the
production due to my fulltime job and lack of discretionary income. Even with minimal
financial capital and time that I had available, I have created and developed
two collections that include custom prints, leather goods and home decor. 
If I can reach the goal of $75,000 it would
allow me to dedicate all my time to building the brand to its full potential. 

Risks & Challenges

This is my biggest business venture and with that may
come unprecedented issues, however I’m very
excited to take them on headfirst.  The
greatest problem the brand currently faces is low visibility, but this will be remedied by aligning GIBRON with like-minded craft
and trade shows.  I have a long history of working in retail and customer service,
which have helped me refine my salesmanship skills.  GIBRON is operating on a lean business model, which means the

<p>The CAPP Alumni
Association is a network of CAPP graduates that are dedicated to continuing to
grow and deepen the community that they’ve created in CAPP. We aim to unite CAPP graduates
across multiple cohorts for networking, collaborating, continuing education and mutual
support. The CAPP Alumni Association is bonded by a deep desire to build their wellbeing and the wellbeing of those around them, and a deep appreciation for the gifts that the
CAPP program and the Flourishing Center has given them. </p>
<p>In CAPP we learn about SoMo Leaders (Social and Emotional Leaders).  These are people who understand that they do not live in a bubble.  That the changes they make within themselves ripple out to the their networks of friends, family, co-workers and community at large.</p>
<p>SoMo Leaders see themselves as change agents and catalysts for positivity in their community. They understand deeply the ties that connect all beings and focus on being the change they wish to see in the world. </p>

<p>My name is Raul Roa and I'm a photojournalist in Southern California. I'm also an avid bird photographer and bird watcher.   I've given birdwatching presentations at my son's elementary school and children loved them.  Birdwatching takes people outdoors and people exercise without even realizing it.  One can spend half an hour to a couple of hours in no time looking for birds at a local park or even just around the neighborhood.  So, with children's obesity rate at an all time high, I <span style="""">want to help children get outdoors and I think that I can do my part to get children interested in the outdoors and walking. There are many natural areas and nature centers but many times children and their parents don't even realize how close they are to some of them. I want to introduce children to the nature centers and natural areas so they can spend times outdoors walking and looking for birds.</span></p>
<p>After giving my birdwatching presentations, children always send me letters expressing their admiration and awe for the birds I've shown them.  Some of them tell me they went home and looked for birds, or went to the zoo and looked at exotic birds.  One child once told me, when I was wrapping up my slide show, that he wished he could go home with me because he liked the birds I showed him so much! Children sometimes just need a little bit of a push to get outdoors and walk.</p>
<p>Birding is a great activity that gives everyone some exercise.  Spending a half an hour to a few hours outdoors can be good for anyone, including children. I plan to give a slideshow of birds 3rd and 4th grade students can see all around them and then take them on a short birding walk around their school grounds. I need binoculars, bird books, and equipment to give the slide show and show them how to take a photo or two of the birds they see, plus materials for them to keep that they can use later as they birdwatch themselves.  It's a huge project but I am confident that I can accomplish it. I do not plan to charge the schools for my time and service.</p>
<p>I want to do it on a volunteer basis but I need your help to achieve this goal.  I need the right equipment to give them a presentation and birding walk that will get spark their interest in the outdoors.   I plan to start these events in the Fall and do them for a couple of hours, a few times per month or more, on my days off. The school's won't have to pay for the presentations. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Here are some quotes from children who have seen my presentation.</span><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“You taught us about birds. I got inspired so I set up a bird feeder in my backyard.”</p>
<p>Yolanda, 3rd grade student</p>
<p>“Thank you for showing us the birds and teaching us different kinds of birds, what they eat and their habitat.”</p>
<p>Andre, 3rd grade student</p>
<p>“I wish you can visit us again.”</p>
<p>Henry, 3rd grade student</p>
<p>“Thank you for all the pictures you showed our class.  By the way, never stop looking at birds.”</p>
<p>Jessica, 3rd grade student</p>
<p>“I wish I was like you.  I can’t wait to see a Condor.”</p>
<p>Jordan, 3rd grade student</p>And a teacher's note.<p></p>
<p>“Once again you’ve enlightened my students… Hopefully the increased awareness will encourage them to take care of our earth.”</p>
<p>3rd grade teacher</p>
<p>I also do two birding walks a year, as a volunteer, for the city of Glendale Parks &amp; Rec. and maybe I can also do these at community centers for larger groups of children as well. I have friends in various cities parks &amp; rec depts. and I know they'd be thrilled to have me show kids how to bird. I realize that our economy has hit everyone hard, but I also know that there are those people out there, like many of you, who are able to help.  So, I humbly and respectfully ask you to help me help children. Please go to the website and donate whatever you can and please share the link with others who can help as well.  I thank you from the bottom of my heart in advance.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <ul> <li>I'm asking for $30,000 for equipment and materials that will serve for many many years. The initial investment is a lot of money but it will buy everything I need to get children involved in birdwatching. I need binoculars and bird books to lend to the entire class at each visit. I also need a laptop and a projector with a screen. A birdwatching camera setup is also needed so when the children go on the birdwatching walk they can snap some photos of the birds on their school grounds. A printer is also needed to create the materials that will be given to the children. </li> <li>You can be a major sponsor  with your name prominently mentioned in the presentation and in all advertising materials with your contribution of $5,000</li>
<li>Donations of $30 will buy a birding guide and the first 30 donors will have their name out in one of the books noting that it was your donation that made the book possible. Binoculars are $200 ea.  The first 30 donors who contribute this amount will have their name placed on one of the 30 binoculars needed so that each child is able to use one.  The projector ($1,300) and screen ($400) will cost approximately $1,700 and if you donate that amount first, your name will always be mentioned as the person who made that equipment possible. Then there's the laptop with the programs to create the slide shows and that's about $3,500.  The most expensive part of this program, but the item that will last the longest is the camera, lens and tripod/gimbal combination needed for birdwatching photography.  The total is about $16,000.  Then there is protective items for the equipment and cases to carry all the equipment from place to place and the printer to create all the materials that will be handed out to children at the presentations.  In any case, every single person who donates will be listed at the end of the program so that the students know that the presentation was made possible by the good will of many people who care for them. </li>
<li>If you want to purchase the items directly and have them sent to me, we can do that as well.  I have specific brands that I've researched which will work the best for what I want to do, so if you are so inclined to purchase the item straight out from the specialty stores that I've researched, please let me know and I will give you the model number of the item and the store website that it is available from. And as previously mentioned, any item purchased with your donation will have your name on it stating you were the donor that made the item possible. You can contact me at roaemail@gmail.com for any question you may have.</li> <li>I don't have much to offer besides my photography, so if there are any bird photos you like in my Facebook or Instagram I can send you an 8x10 of it for every $50 contribution. Just let me know which one by taking a screenshot and sending me an email to roaemail@gmail.com. I am grateful for anything you can donate and I can also sign the photo for you if you'd like. </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Your contribution will help me get children going outdoors and walking and exercising. </p> <ul> <li>I believe this is extremely important because I can give children skills that will last for a lifetime and they can use those for a healthier lifestyle. Waking outside and looking for birds will take them away from sitting inside playing video games, which I believe is a major contributor to children's obesity. </li> <li>Every time I've given a birding presentation children they all been positive and given me really great feedback. They write notes telling me they enjoyed the birds and some even go home and look for birds on their own. One child told me one time as I finished my presentation he wished he could go home with me because he liked the birds so much. </li>
<li>We all know or have children in elementary school. Wouldn't it be great if they could learn something new and exciting like birdwatching. </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>I believe this is a worthy cause and my challenge will be in raising the money needed.  Once I have the funds, getting the equipment and pitching the project to schools will be the easy part. I know my son's former teachers were all very positive about the presentation the first time I told them about it and even other teachers who watched had be come back for their own classes.</p> <ul> <li>I've always been a positive person and outgoing. If I do not meet my goal this time with the fundraising the funds info receive will make the initial purchase of binoculars and bird books and any other equipment that I can afford. I will continue trying to raise funds until I have everything I need to get e children the best presentation possible. I want to give my best to them so they know there are people out there who truly care about them and their health. </li> <li>I have about 4 months to get everything ready and I know I can accomplish this goal because I've done the presentations before and all I need is the equipment to start calling schools and offering my free program. </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p> <ul> <li>If you can, share the link on Facebook, Twitter and email to those you know.</li> <li>Please share this story with everyone. I truly am grateful for any help you can give me, financial or otherwise.  Please share this link: <a href=""http://igg.me/p/1300502/twtr/11017697"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://igg.me/p/1300502/twtr/11017697</a> </li>

Donations of $30 will buy a birding guide and the first 30 donors will have their name out in one of the books noting that it was your donation that made the book possible. Binoculars are $200 ea.  The first 30 donors who contribute this amount will have their name placed on one of the 30 binoculars needed so that each child is able to use one.  The projector ($1,300) and screen ($400) will cost approximately $1,700 and if you donate that amount first, your name will always be mentioned as the person who made that equipment possible. Then there's the laptop with the programs to create the slide shows and that's about $3,500.  The most expensive part of this program, but the item that will last the longest is the camera, lens and tripod/gimbal combination needed for birdwatching photography.  The total is about $16,000.  Then there is protective items for the equipment and cases to carry all the equipment from place to place and the printer to create all the materials that will be handed out to children at the presentations.  In any case, every single person who donates will be listed at the end of the program so that the students know that the presentation was made possible by the good will of many people who care for them. 
If you want to purchase the items directly and have them sent to me, we can do that as well.  I have specific brands that I've researched which will work the best for what I want to do, so if you are so inclined to purchase the item straight out from the specialty stores that I've researched, please let me know and I will give you the model number of the item and the store website that it is available from. And as previously mentioned, any item purchased with your donation will have your name on it stating you were the donor that made the item possible. You can contact me at roaemail@gmail.com for any question you may have. I don't have much to offer besides my photography, so if there are any bird photos you like in my Facebook or Instagram I can send you an 8x10 of it for every $50 contribution. Just let me know which one by taking a screenshot and sending me an email to roaemail@gmail.com. I am grateful for anything you can donate and I can also sign the photo for you if you'd like.     The Impact Your contribution will help me get children going outdoors and walking and exercising.   I believe this is extremely important because I can give children skills that will last for a lifetime and they can use those for a healthier lifestyle. Waking outside and looking for birds will take them away from sitting inside playing video games, which I believe is a major contributor to children's obesity.  Every time I've given a birding presentation children they all been positive and given me really great feedback. They write notes telling me they enjoyed the birds and some even go home and look for birds on their own. One child told me one time as I finished my presentation he wished he could go home with me because he liked the birds so much. 
We all know or have children in elementary school. Wouldn't it be great if they could learn something new and exciting like birdwatching.     Risks & Challenges I believe this is a worthy cause and my challenge will be in raising the money needed.  Once I have the funds, getting the equipment and pitching the project to schools will be the easy part. I know my son's former teachers were all very positive about the presentation the first time I told them about it and even other teachers who watched had be come back for their own classes.  I've always been a positive person and outgoing. If I do not meet my goal this time with the fundraising the funds info receive will make the initial purchase of binoculars and bird books and any other equipment that I can afford. I will continue trying to raise funds until I have everything I need to get e children the best presentation possible. I want to give my best to them so they know there are people out there who truly care about them and their health.  I have about 4 months to get everything ready and I know I can accomplish this goal because I've done the presentations before and all I need is the equipment to start calling schools and offering my free program.     Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  If you can, share the link on Facebook, Twitter and email to those you know. Please share this story with everyone. I truly am grateful for any help you can give me, financial or otherwise.  Please share this link: http://igg.me/p/1300502/twtr/11017697",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

   Screening Costs and Theater Rental Fee We need your help to secure additional funding to cover the costs to host the Tulsa screening of The Mask You Live In on Tuesday, August 18 at 6pm.  Earlier this summer I ran a separate campaign to raise money for an Oklahoma City screening. After the success of that event, I turned to contacts in Tulsa to schedule a second screening and discussion.

$300 USD is our minimum goal to offer the film to a capacity of 140 people
$985 USD is the maximum to offer the film to an audience of 222 people in Circle Cinema's largest auditorium.  Unused funding will go toward organizing a third screening in Norman or will be donated to The Representation Project.    Community 

Your contribution helps to make this screening and discussion free to the Tulsa community. 

After I hosted the first screening in Oklahoma City in June, I connected with Mana Tahaie of YWCA Tulsa, who has partnered with me to host this film for the Tulsa community.


There will be a discussion panel following the film, in order to jumpstart this very important conversation. 


    If you cannot give…


Please, forward the trailer and links on to anyone you know and come to the viewing of The Mask You Live In.

Attending the screening is just as important as raising the money to make it possible to view.
Sharing information about The Representation Project's The Mask You Live In on any social media outlets and with your friends and family is a great way to start the conversation within your community.

English summary: This funding effort is helping the largest orphanage in Serbia (Childrens village in Novi Sad) cope with the heating cost for the forthcoming winter, enabling us to get the pellets (bio renewable heating fuel) we need for the season, totaling around 30.000USD. More information in english on the bottom of the page, and on our website in english: Childrens village english websiteUstanova za decu i omladinu  Dečije selo dr. Milorad Pavlović Sremska Kamenica počela je sa radom 1975 godine. Osnovna delatnost ustanove je zbrinjavanje dece bez roditeljskog staranja, dece čiji je razvoj ometen porodičnim prilikama, raznim oblicima zlostavljanja i zanemarivanja do stvaranja uslova za zbrinjavanje u sopstvenu ili alternativnu porodicu ili do osposobljavanja za samostalni život. Dečije selo je državna ustanova socijalne zaštite, delatnost finansira budžet Republike Srbije a osnivač ustanove je Vlada AP Vojvodine. Organizacija i koncepcija rada utvrdjeni su Podzakonskim aktima Ministarstva za rad i socijalnu politiku R Srbije, a na osnovu ovih akata bliže uređena opštim aktima ustanove koja su na snazi.

 


  Šta smo do sada uradili? 9. septembra 2015. godine, potpisivanjem Ugovora o ugradnji kotlova na biomasu zaokružili smo jednogodišnji ciklus žive aktivnosti i investicija  u Dečje selo ""Dr Milorad Pavlović"" Sremska Kamenica, Srbija, koji uključuje i:-nastavak 4 i pokretanje novih 8 projekata usmerenih na osnaživanje i obrazovanje štićenika;-pokretanje akcije ""Promeni svet sms porukom na 5186"";-nabavke i instalacije najmodernije telefonske VoIP centrale;-nabavke i instalacije sistema bežičnog Interneta;-nabavke i instalacije sistema zagrevanja sanitarne vode solarnom energijom;-nabavke i instalacije sistema video nadzora sa daljinskim i odloženim osmatranjem;-potpunu konverziju rasvetnih tela u Selu i stanovima štedljivim, najmodernijim led sijalicama i cevima;-upristojavanje igrališta u Dečjem selu i izgradnja teretane na otvorenom;-projekta javnih radova sa 35 radnika svih profila;-uključivanje stručnih volontera i saradnika u oblastima kao što su radionički rad, logopedija...;-puštanje u rad softvera za učenje na daljinu, kao i sistema za evidenciju prisustva zaposlenih karticama;-opremanje 3 nova, poklonjena stana kompletnim nameštajem i tehnikom;-i mnogo mnogo drugih aktivnosti koje ulepšavaju život i olakšavaju detinjstvo našoj dečici!Ovim putem se ponovo zahvaljujem svim prijateljicama i prijateljima, saradnicima i radnicima, volonterima, donatorima, predstavnicima vlasti i medija, jer bez Vas, ništa od ovoga ne bi bilo moguće!


Zašto nam je sada potrebna Vaša pomoć
Kako bismo nesmetano grejali Dečje selo uz pomoć novih, ekoloških kotlova na biomasu, neophodno je da prikupimo sredstva za nabavku peleta, koja iznose oko 25.000€. 


  Rezultati Svaka Vaša donacija će biti upotrebljena isključivo za nabavku peleta za grejanje. Ove nabavke se obavljaju na potpuno jasan i zakonom propisan način, po pravilima za Javne nabavke u Javnim Ustanovama i preduzećima u Srbiji.
Svaki doniran dinar će omogućiti lakšu, lepšu i topliju zimu za naše štićenike i omogućiti im makar materijalne preduslove za lep život, učenje i rad.
    Rizici U vremenima u kojima živimo često je teško očekivati pomoć drugih kada su u pitanju humanitarni ciljevi, pa makar i jedne takve utemeljene i ugledne Ustanove kao što je Dečje selo u Sremskoj Kamenici. Kampanja ""pošalji sms na 5186"" je tako dala polovične rezultate, tako da postoji mogući rizik neuspeha i ovog načina prikupljanja sredstava. U tom slučaju će se Selo, kao i do sada, krajnjim naporom zaposlenih i čitave zajednice, snalaziti kako zna i ume.
    Ako nemate novca ili ne posedujete kreditnu karticu Najvrednije što možete da date Selu je prisustvo, pomoć, pažnja našoj deci. Slobodno nas kontaktirajte, navratite, osnažite našu dečicu. Održite im čas matematike, donesite igraču. Ukoliko imate mogućnost da pelet donirate u toj formi, rado ćemo prihvatiti i taj vid pomoći, kao i sve druge.

<p>Hello! My name is <b><i>Domingo Atao Condori</i></b>. I am a co-owner of Ayni Peru Expedition. When I was 8 years old, I left my very small village in the mountains with my older brothers. The education was not very good there. I remember we had a teacher who spoke, only Spanish and I did not understand anything she said because <b>my language was Quechua, the language of the Incas…my ancestors.</b></p>
<p>The village school had two desks made by stacked bricks and our seats were stools made with alpaca leather. There were shared pencils and paper but no notebooks, books or backpacks. There was no heating in the room and the chalkboard was old and ready to fall off the wall.</p>
<p><b>There was no electricity in the village</b>. Therefore, we rushed to do the little homework we received or went to someone’s house who had candles. We never knew if we did the work correctly because of the language difference between the teacher and the students. But we kept going to school hoping to learn something.</p>
<p><b>By third grade, my older brothers and I left our small village in the back of a truck transporting potatoes to a city called Cusco</b>, where there were opportunities for a better future, which was not easy. I worked and learned Spanish then in my teens I attended night school to learn English and get a certificate in tourism.  Currently, Ayni Peru Expedition helps one school near Cusco.

Benefits for the language learners


Contextualized
acquisition and development of communication skills in foreign language. Putting learners in situations resembling real life creates better grounds for mastering of foreign language (words, whole phrases and language structures).

Confidence to express
thoughts in a foreign language. Confidence allows students to feel safe even
in situations where they may not know a word or do not fully understand the interlocutor - they can explain words
that they do not know or may ask clarifying questions.

Learning comes naturally
and fun. Students may not even notice that they are in a foreign language class
- an important prerequisite to reduce stress and increase motivation to learn a
foreign language.


What is different about the method?




Language practice


Standard courses






We
       practice the language. We speak IN the language. In our
       classes teachers and students speak IN the target language.


Students
       are active inventing dialogues, situations, roles. They talk, play,
       sing, improvise.


Teachers
       support the learning process. They provide the structure of the
       classes and if necessary clarify meanings and language rules.

The
       acquisition of grammar and words comes naturally as in a real situation.
       Young children learn languages without knowing the rules and
       structures of the language. They learn led by their own needs and
       curiosity. Similarly we are aiming at the spontaneous learning we gain
       when we are in real language situation and engage simultaneously our
       minds, senses and feelings.
Students
       express themselves and work on topics that are interesting to them.



Standard
       courses rely heavily on language rules explanation. The oral
       communication in the target language is limited during classes.

Less
       practice, less role plays and less dialogues. 
The
       teacher is the active side.
Students
       are passive, receptive, expect information from the teacher.

Memorization
       of rules and words is required. 




What the classes look like?The
content of the classes is flexible and conformed to the language skills and
interests of the students. Tasks are presented in more or less structured
way on relevant for the students topics. During the language practice students
work  out different situations. It
is not important whether they make mistakes. It is important to talk, to
communicate, to express thoughts and ideas. During the classes grammar
rules and word meanings may be explained; examples for a situation, words and
phrases may be given. The teacher assesses the complexity of the grammar and vocabulary to be given in each exercise.Depending on the language and comfort level of the students the exercises will be more or less structured. For example:Exercise
“Casting”

play. Students
rotate in the roles of the actor/actress and the members of the jury. It is
up to the students what will be the content of the presentations and
conversations during the exercise. 
Level 2Teacher
provides students with:
-
magazines and books so they can pick a text to reproduce for the casting and 
- main
characteristics of the members of the jury, for example:
Jury
member 1 is angry, just soiled his/her shirt
with coffee, s/he does not follow the actor/actresses presentation.
Jury member 2 is eccentric, s/he requests from the actor/actress to read and play
more expressively, even extravagantly.
Jury member 3 is balanced and supportive.

Level 3
Teacher provides text for the actor/actress to read and cues for the jury
members.

</div></div>","Necesitamos aumentar el impacto
No obstante, la naturaleza digital de la plataforma limitó este propósito ya que la mayoría de las víctimas viven en región y no tienen acceso a internet. Es por esto que nace un segundo proyecto llamado ‘Yo sobreviví al conflicto’, el cual, busca acercar Rutas del Conflicto a las víctimas y de esta forma lograr una reconstrucción conjunta de estos hechos y darles voz a través de un ejercicio de memoria histórica. Buscamos acercar esta plataforma digital a las regiones de Colombia para alcanzar una mayor participación de las víctimas de las comunidades rurales. Vamos a crear una forma para que las comunidades construyan la historia de la guerra con herramientas periodísticas, desde su realidad, desde su creatividad, desde su visión de los hechos.Para lograrlo necesitamos financiar viajes hacia tres regiones de Colombia: Antioquia, Cauca y Santander, además de recursos humanos y tecnológicos para dictar cursos básicos de periodismo que le den a estos nuevos participantes herramientas para narrar sus propias historias.Con tu ayuda podremos mejorar la información de Rutas del Conflicto y seguir produciendo contenidos que contribuyan a completar la memoria del conflicto en Colombia.Otras formas en las que puedes ayudarSi no puedes donar, ayúdanos con tu red de contactos para contarle al mundo de nuestra campaña, el proyecto y de lo que queremos hacer por nuestro país.Visita nuestra página y suscríbete al boletín para mantenerte informado.Síguenos en Facebook, Twitter y nuestra cuenta de Instagram y si quieres compartir esta campaña puedes mencionar a @RutasConflicto.Acerca de:¿Quién sabe de la guerra en Colombia? ¿Los ciudadanos, la justicia, los medios de comunicación o los grupos armados? La realidad es que la información está dispersa y es inexacta. Por eso creamos el proyecto Rutas del Conflicto, el primer portal web que reúne toda esta información a partir de una base de datos periodística con información del conflicto en Colombia.Esta plataforma permite visualizar los datos a través de mapas y líneas de tiempo que explican el contexto histórico y geográfico de la guerra. Víctimas, investigadores académicos y periodistas pueden aportar información para seguir construyendo la base de datos. Desde su lanzamiento en 2014 más de tres mil personas descargaron la aplicación para móviles y el sitio web ha tenido  alrededor de 250 mil visitas.Rutas del Conflicto surgió de la necesidad de visibilizar los hechos del conflicto armado colombiano que no habían sido narrados ni resaltados por los medios de comunicación y el mismo Estado, convirtiéndose en la primera base de datos periodística con información visualizada y de contexto.Para más información
Rutas del Conflicto se ha construído de la mano del portal periodístico VerdadAbierta.com, el Centro Nacional de Memoria Histórica y ConLupa.co,  documentando 728 masacres perpetradas entre 1982 hasta la fecha. Somos un proyecto que busca ser una fuente de consulta para centros de enseñanza, investigadores, medios de comunicación, organizaciones de víctimas y ciudadanos del común.

<h1>Isis executes Palmyra antiquities chief and hangs him from ruins he spent a lifetime restoring</h1>
<br/><br/><p>It was sadly reported today in the press that  Isis militants have tortured and executed the antiquities chief of the ancient city of Palmyra, 81-year-old Khaled al-Assad.</p>
<p>The head of Syria's department of antiquities said that militants later took Mr Asaad's body from the square where he was executed and hung it from a Roman column in one of the ruins he had dedicated more than 50 years of his life to restoring.<br/><br/></p>

</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>We live in a world where some seek to hold back education and enlightenment and take us back to a dark age where war lords use quasi-religious justifications to do the worst deeds imaginable, leaving misery and destruction in their wake, I for one feel unable to stop the tide of cruelty that I see many drowning in however I think that collectively we can make a difference and that this man's death should be a catalyst for ensuring that a student out there passionate about this field should be funded to continue in Khaled al-Assad's vein protecting humanity's collective history and preserving it for posterity to enlighten us all.<br/><br/>I'm just one guy and can't fund such studies by myself so I am reaching out to you all, other's who I have seen comment and commiserate and lament his passing to chip in and do what you can to salvage some good from this dreadful situation, to lift the spirits of those who like me all to often feel powerless in the face of such things to do anything other than lament the passing of a good man from a sometimes too cruel world and to help a student out there start on a journey that may see them follow in his footsteps into a noble career spanning a lifetime and to in that small way feel my own soul less burdened by the grief I felt at hearing of his passing in such a horrendous way. <br/><br/>He died saving something for all of us, I honestly feel the least we can do as a global community is to show our appreciation for the ultimate sacrifice he made and to do some good in his name. We cannot bring him back but we can collectively commemorate his bravery and enable someone else to continue his work. </p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>I have never done a crowd funder before nor sponsored a students studies however I am a good man and work promoting businesses on Facebook and have achieved some modest successes with certain communities I've built that have reached over 1 million likes in my time which I will happily be promoting this on until such time as it reaches it's goal or becomes apparent that it sadly won't in which case as previously stated the monies raised will still do much good by assisting those in dire need in the region.<br/><br/>I welcome any assistance or advice from anyone who does have experience in crowd funding or the educational/archaeological fields to see how best to allocate the monies raised to achieve the stated goals and will be reaching out to local universities in the next couple of days to see how this can be facilitated and processed and to do good .<br/><br/>I'm tenacious and if this, as I hope, does raise enough money to fund a student I will work diligently in conjunction with some members of my family, my trusted elders, with experience in the field of eduction to see the money is well spent and be transparent in how in any event the monies raised are allocated to assure you that some good will come of this man's sad demise one way or another. <br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you are not in a position to donate but would like to assist this effort then <i>please</i> share this page, tweet and email your friends and promote on social media and in public forums, the press, anywhere as you see fit.

It was sadly reported today in the press that  Isis militants have tortured and executed the antiquities chief of the ancient city of Palmyra, 81-year-old Khaled al-Assad.
The head of Syria's department of antiquities said that militants later took Mr Asaad's body from the square where he was executed and hung it from a Roman column in one of the ruins he had dedicated more than 50 years of his life to restoring.



They tortured him for a month to get information about the city and its treasures.He refused to tell them anything.

Held for a month a tortured by barbarians this heroic man gave no quarter and died safeguarding humanity's history, his life's work and irreplaceable artefacts that belong to the whole of humanity. 
My Name is Jay Burnett, I'm not an expert on archaeological studies, nor a student of the field myself but what I am is a human with utter admiration for a man who would die defending humanity's heritage, these ruins and antiquities he spent his life restoring tell a part of our collective story and it saddened me greatly to hear of his passing in such a fashion at the hands of misguided and (for want of a better word) evil men determined to drag the region back centuries and destroy monuments that have stood for thousands of years, to allay my feelings of impotence and despair at the way the world is going and to salvage some good from this heartbreaking story I propose that we raise enough to fund the studies of a student in the field of Archaeology is his memory to continue the noble work that was this brave man's passion and to commemorate this hero's passing. 
His valiant efforts in the face of overwhelming cruelty should never be forgotten and if some good can come of this I feel this would act as a fitting memorial.  
If you agree please donate what you can and I will pass on all funds raised through appropriate channels to see that a student out there interested in this field has their studies funded in his memory. For more: http://huff.to/1J3wwaJ
This campaign has been sanctioned by Directorate-General of Antiquities & Museums, Syria.For more: http://on.fb.me/1MSaqMj
We need to raise £25,000 to fund a students studies in this field to act as a fitting memorial to this man's heroic sacrifice. 
   The money raised from this campaign will be donated to  Aliyah Hasinah Holderwho is aiming to raise £18,000 to study a BA in History & International Relations at Royal Holloway! The minimum amount I must raise is £4,500 by September in order to enroll! She's also pushing for more representation of ethnic minority groups through art such as film and writing. She wants to study at University in order to learn and bring attention to so called alternative histories, I'll dig deep into history in return for you digging deep or shallowly into your generous pockets!You can find out more about  Aliyah here: https://hubbub.net/p/fundAlyBA
    The Impact We live in a world where some seek to hold back education and enlightenment and take us back to a dark age where war lords use quasi-religious justifications to do the worst deeds imaginable, leaving misery and destruction in their wake, I for one feel unable to stop the tide of cruelty that I see many drowning in however I think that collectively we can make a difference and that this man's death should be a catalyst for ensuring that a student out there passionate about this field should be funded to continue in Khaled al-Assad's vein protecting humanity's collective history and preserving it for posterity to enlighten us all.I'm just one guy and can't fund such studies by myself so I am reaching out to you all, other's who I have seen comment and commiserate and lament his passing to chip in and do what you can to salvage some good from this dreadful situation, to lift the spirits of those who like me all to often feel powerless in the face of such things to do anything other than lament the passing of a good man from a sometimes too cruel world and to help a student out there start on a journey that may see them follow in his footsteps into a noble career spanning a lifetime and to in that small way feel my own soul less burdened by the grief I felt at hearing of his passing in such a horrendous way. He died saving something for all of us, I honestly feel the least we can do as a global community is to show our appreciation for the ultimate sacrifice he made and to do some good in his name. We cannot bring him back but we can collectively commemorate his bravery and enable someone else to continue his work.    Risks & Challenges I have never done a crowd funder before nor sponsored a students studies however I am a good man and work promoting businesses on Facebook and have achieved some modest successes with certain communities I've built that have reached over 1 million likes in my time which I will happily be promoting this on until such time as it reaches it's goal or becomes apparent that it sadly won't in which case as previously stated the monies raised will still do much good by assisting those in dire need in the region.I welcome any assistance or advice from anyone who does have experience in crowd funding or the educational/archaeological fields to see how best to allocate the monies raised to achieve the stated goals and will be reaching out to local universities in the next couple of days to see how this can be facilitated and processed and to do good .I'm tenacious and if this, as I hope, does raise enough money to fund a student I will work diligently in conjunction with some members of my family, my trusted elders, with experience in the field of eduction to see the money is well spent and be transparent in how in any event the monies raised are allocated to assure you that some good will come of this man's sad demise one way or another.    Other Ways You Can Help If you are not in a position to donate but would like to assist this effort then please share this page, tweet and email your friends and promote on social media and in public forums, the press, anywhere as you see fit.

German-Bavarian Restaurant</i></b></p>
<p><b>Traditional
Bavarian culture meets modern American lifestyle</b></p>
<p><b><i>Project:</i></b></p>
<p>My goal is
to start a restaurant business at ten
different places in the USA, situated at high traffic locations. These restaurants will be in a German/Bavarian
style. It is my intention that this will be the first and only drive-in in this
style anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>We have
worked relentlessly and have designed a tri-modular concept that has not been seen before that includes a restaurant
with a bakery, a butcher shop as well as a drive-in, all combined under one
roof.</p>
<p>Many
full-time jobs will be created with our
new tri-modular restaurant business model. Thus the money you invest will help
to create sustainable income for over 200 workers.</p>
<p>At 3 separate drive-in counters with large shop windows, the customer will
be able to watch the production of fresh baked breads,  meat products according to original German,
Bavarian and Austrian recipes and purchase single products or pick them up as a
finished menu.</p>
<p>In addition, the
two indoor levels and two outdoor terraces will offer the possibility of eating
locally for up to 300 guests. Coupled with a hearty German hospitality, the
quaint premises, in stylistic reference to the Munich Oktoberfest, will be
styled to always offer an invitation to
relax.</p>
<p>The facilities will also offer event character through the implementation
of family and company parties, department, club, and corporate events, as well
as special theme days: Dance around the Maypole, Oktoberfest, Thanksgiving as
well as many others.</p>
<p>The on-site
merchandising shop will provide the typical souvenirs, from key chains to
pitchers, dirndl, cuckoo clocks and everything the heart desires.</p>
<p><b><i>The Concept</i></b></p>
<p>The result
would be a drive-in restaurant with strong
Bavarian character. The architecture would be reminiscent of a typical Alpine
mountain farm. It would showcase massive woodwork in the indoor and outdoor
areas, balconies in the inner and outer part of the facility, and terraces in a
beer garden style.</p>
<p>The
furnishings in rustic solid wood trim can withstand the highest frequency of
guests even when they dance to Bavarian brass music on tables and benches in a
relaxed mood.</p>
<p>The
combined drive-in stations would first present:</p>
<p><i>The Bakery:</i></p>
<p>Fresh rolls, pretzels, traditional German brown and black bread, cakes,
pies and the like will be produced in the open kitchen for all to see,
according to original recipes and production methods, and offered for sale
fresh out of the oven.</p>
<p><i>The Butcher
Shop:</i></p>
<p>Also according to original recipe, the master butcher prepares everything
from Bavarian white sausages to meatloaf and meatballs, fried chicken, roasted
pork leg, schnitzel and bratwurst, Nürnberger sausage with sauerkraut or pork
roast with red cabbage.
Seasonal dishes like kale and smoked sausage, groats or various stews
individually round out the offer.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>
<p>I believe
that by using this crowd funding platform, we can raise the necessary funds to
move this from the drawing board to actual implementation. We are actively in
the process of locating the premises for this undertaking and we could
certainly benefit from your generosity.</p>
<p>We know you
cannot spend as much as we need but with enough money, we can finance the cost
of an IPO. Remember the story of Shake Shack earlier this year? They generated
25 million dollars for one restaurant. We only need 3-4 million per restaurant.

</div></div>","Short Summary ""Education is a woman's fastest route out of Poverty.""-- Barbara Lucas, US Board Chair, WomensTrust This campaign is for our education program.  Our simple aim: to get and keep Ghanaian girls in school. 70% percent of girls drop out of high school in Ghana.  In our program, 95% of our scholarship recipients graduate. Currently we grant around 240 scholarships a year.  This year we have four students at University.   What We Need & What You Get Mostly, we need you to help us fund scholarships.
Here's what you get for how much you give:  $25 covers a backpack and school supplies for one girl. $50 covers a school uniform. $100 covers fees for one year of Junior High School.
$350 coveres fees for one year of Senior High School.
. . . But even $1 moves us closer to our goal,
And a gift of any amount earns our eternal gratitude.    Impact ""They need to know they can do so much more than just sit at home.""-- Regina, WomensTrust Scholarship Recipient, on the fate of elderly women in rural Ghana and why she is training to be their nurse

serving as a US Peace Corps Volunteer in Dang Tung, Cambodia from 2008-2010. Dara
is a native of Dang Tung District, the poorest district in Kampot Province,
Cambodia, a district of about 58,000 people, of which 40% are under the age of 18 and 91% are subsistence-level rice farmers. As of 2013, the population of Dang Tung has been decreasing as people leave to seek jobs elsewhere. In 2013, 9% of the Dang Tung population had to leave their children and families behind to work within Cambodia, mostly in sweatshops/factories around  the capital. 4.5% left to work outside the country in similar but even more trying settings.</p>
<p>While watching the video above, you will learn about Dara’s hopes and
dreams for Dang Tung, and you will meet members of the Dang Tung community who
are so eager to bring more learning to their home, a place where every year more and more students simply drop out of school, with 9% of the 7600 children aged 6-11, and 13% of all children, not enrolled in 2013.   (For more stories of Dang Tung residents, check out the photos and stories in the Gallery, more and more of which we will be adding on a regular basis.) </p>

The “Troy” Chavez
Memorial Peace Garden has been established since 1994 and is built on an acre
and a half of land. The fence we would like to build must allow the community
to always be able to view the garden as to always make them feel welcome and a
part of it. We have considered many styles of fences and have given it much
thought. We realize the fence we desire is a little more expensive but a wooden
fence would cut the community off and a wrought iron fence gives the garden an
unwelcoming feeling. Our goal is not to cut the community off but to protect
the garden. The fence we currently have has three openings so we would also
have to replace three gates that we can lock and close the garden at night.
Although the garden is highly respected, watched and cared for by the
community, once the plants grow and it’s late at night it is easy for people to
hide from view. We have installed solar lights and of course our goal is to put
in more as we raise funds but we still get homeless people who unfortunately
are not interested in the care of the garden. We work with youth and their
safety is always a priority of our organization. We also feel there is no need
for anyone to be in the garden after hours but currently have no way of
preventing their entry. This fence would not only provide safety to the garden
but also add security for the youth who participate. We really hope anyone who considers
donating to this project that you take the time to walk through the garden so
that you can see its importance to the community located at 3825 Shoshone St in Denver CO. Please feel free to visit our
website that is updated with our work in the community and visit us at

<p>Under the direction of Dr. Andrew B. Williams, the HEIR Lab engineering team at Marquette University is making strides to expand their knowledge of robotics by participating in RoboCup 2015 in Hefei, China this July.<br/></p>
<p>Through the not so simple act of having robots play competitive soccer against each other, our team is collaborating with robotics experts from around the world to progress the use of robotics in academics and daily lives.  While soccer is the current mission, we can see the long term benefits of robots in the near future. The HEIR Lab's mission is to fight childhood obesity and transform the lives of children with robots. The current robots in the lab are prototypes of personal training robots that can be used to teach children proper exercise technique and inspire children of all backgrounds. Through our robotic developments, we can change the world.</p>
<p>This will be our second year competing in RoboCup and over the course of the last year, we have made significant improvements to our robots' design and programing. We will once again be the only American team in attendance and want to continue to build international robotic connections to continue our research.  We are looking for your help to raise funds for three things:<br/></p>

<p>Both working parents, weather, safety, and lack of parks and natural surroundings in our bleak urban landscape have been blamed for children spending less time outdoors.<br/></p>
<p><b>Mission</b><br/></p>
<p>To bring approximately 400 Grade 6 and 7 students into nature to learn about the importance of their environment through hands-on interactive learning during our inaugural <b>Stepping into Nature Festival</b>. We want to inspire, connect, and engage students with nature and demonstrate their interdependence on it.  <br/></p>
<p><b>Details</b><br/></p>
<p>The festival will take place over the course of 4 days in October 2015 in the<b> <a href=""http://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/burns-bog-delta-nature-reserve/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Delta Nature Reserve</a></b>.  The reserve is part of the iconic <b></b><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burns_Bog"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Burns Bog </b></a>- the largest undeveloped urban wilderness in North America.  It is located in the heart of the Lower Mainland and easily accessible to surrounding schools. Local environmental education organizations have carefully planned hands-on activities which will teach participants about the importance and fragility of their local environment. Students will leave the festival with an environmental challenge that will impact those around them and which they must fulfill within the course of their school year.</p>
<p><i>Building leaders in the community</i></p>
<p>Local high school students will be getting involved as well.  With training from our environmental partners, students will be developing their leadership skills and helping to deliver station activities to elementary students during festival days.</p>

<p><b>Challenge - Where we need your help!<br/></b></p>
<p>Transit is expensive. Very expensive! It costs more to get a child to the program than it does to provide the actual program to them.  We want to make this as affordable and accessible to as many local schools as possible. Our budget for the entire program to start up would be $24,776.29. <b>The Pacific Salmon Foundation, Chris Spencer Foundation and the Hamber Foundation </b>have kicked in $7,200 so far, a small student fee will contribute $3,024 and it`s up to us to raise the rest.</p>
<p>After Indiegogo and credit card fees, that becomes exactly $13,388.11 for the program to launch in October 2015. <br/></p>
<p>Our goal for this fundraiser is to raise a modest $5000 to help cover transportation and initial start-up costs. <br/></p>
<p>Every dollar we raise will move us closer to creating a valuable learning experience that will become an annual event.<br/></p>
<p>Solid funding is the core of every project like this one.  The root of conservation is <b>Passion</b> and by engaging students to their natural surroundings, you create amazing citizens for your community.  Here's our breakdown for all the costs involved in the project to the penny.</p>

With less than a month of release about the festival, we have maxed out our registrations with 432 students registered for the festival and a wait-list started for Oct 2015.  Sixty high school student leaders have been confirmed and set to deliver stations over the duration of the festival.  Our incredible environmental partner hosts have programmed excellent hands-on educational stations for students, which align with British Columbia school curriculum.</p>
<p>Help us finish and bring some great kids to learn about nature and open up their minds to the potential they hold as environmentally conscious citizens.  Your pledge could mean a world of difference to someone.  Every environmentalist started with a valuable interaction with nature. <br/></p>
<hr/>
<p><b>Your Impact<br/><i></i></b></p>
<ul>
<li>Providing us the funding for bus transportation to help us connect 432 students to nature.</li>
<li>Supporting a great opportunity to educate the students on the importance of nature and environment and their interdependence on it.<br/>
</li>
<li>Helping to engage students to nature through hands-on experience  in an out-door learning environment<span></span> <br/>
</li>

<span>Encouraging and fostering environmentally responsible citizens.</span><br/>

<li>Building and empowering young leaders in the community.</li>

Additional funding will allow us to cover the remaining operational costs and continue to develop the festival for the following years.  We have a large demand for outdoor educational programs, but we can`t make it happen without funding!<br/><p></p>

<p>We set our sights on $5k to have an achievable goal.  $14k is a large amount of money.  We're still pushing to match our goal, but we didn't want folks to feel their contributions didn't matter.  Every single dollar absolutely matters!</p>

<p><b>What's the goal after this year?</b></p>

</div></div>","Who Are We?We are Burns Bog Conservation Society, a Canadian charity that is committed to protecting and sustaining the world's wetlands and peatlands since 1988. Using Burns Bog as a model, we are dedicated to educating the public on the importance of Burns Bog and the world's peatlands. We provide a voice for the public on important decisions regarding the bog's future, opportunities for the public to interact with the bog's natural environment, and offer a variety of community events to engage the public.We are hosting the Stepping into Nature Festival with a host of environmental partners for a future with environmentally connected and conscious citizens.-----Less technology and more nature for kidsYouths ages 8 to 10 are spending an average of 8 hours a day in front of a screen (i.e. phone, computer, and TV).  Older kids are plugged in for more than 11 hours a day.  With so much time dedicated indoors and on screens, children are developing a disconnect with nature, leading to a new disorder called Nature Deficit Disorder - the theory that a wide range of learning, emotional, and social problems are occurring in children as a result of spending less time outdoors (Last Child in the Woods by Richard Louv). Some of the problems include: anxiety, sedentary lifestyles, depression, attention deficit disorders, and the inability to develop essential social skills. Today, kids are aware of the global threats to the environment, but their physical contact and intimacy with nature is fading.Benefits of natureIncreasing evidence shows interactions with nature has physical, emotional, social benefits and is important for maintaining and improving human health in a rapidly changing world. In addition, nature also stimulates creativity and discovery that comes with experiential play and not just spending their time on video games or TV.The problem
Both working parents, weather, safety, and lack of parks and natural surroundings in our bleak urban landscape have been blamed for children spending less time outdoors.
Mission
To bring approximately 400 Grade 6 and 7 students into nature to learn about the importance of their environment through hands-on interactive learning during our inaugural Stepping into Nature Festival. We want to inspire, connect, and engage students with nature and demonstrate their interdependence on it.  
Details
The festival will take place over the course of 4 days in October 2015 in the Delta Nature Reserve.  The reserve is part of the iconic Burns Bog - the largest undeveloped urban wilderness in North America.  It is located in the heart of the Lower Mainland and easily accessible to surrounding schools. Local environmental education organizations have carefully planned hands-on activities which will teach participants about the importance and fragility of their local environment. Students will leave the festival with an environmental challenge that will impact those around them and which they must fulfill within the course of their school year.
Building leaders in the community
Local high school students will be getting involved as well.  With training from our environmental partners, students will be developing their leadership skills and helping to deliver station activities to elementary students during festival days.



Challenge - Where we need your help!
Transit is expensive. Very expensive! It costs more to get a child to the program than it does to provide the actual program to them.  We want to make this as affordable and accessible to as many local schools as possible. Our budget for the entire program to start up would be $24,776.29. The Pacific Salmon Foundation, Chris Spencer Foundation and the Hamber Foundation have kicked in $7,200 so far, a small student fee will contribute $3,024 and it`s up to us to raise the rest.
After Indiegogo and credit card fees, that becomes exactly $13,388.11 for the program to launch in October 2015. 
Our goal for this fundraiser is to raise a modest $5000 to help cover transportation and initial start-up costs. 
Every dollar we raise will move us closer to creating a valuable learning experience that will become an annual event.
Solid funding is the core of every project like this one.  The root of conservation is Passion and by engaging students to their natural surroundings, you create amazing citizens for your community.  Here's our breakdown for all the costs involved in the project to the penny.

We are so close to success, but we need your help to finish it off! With less than a month of release about the festival, we have maxed out our registrations with 432 students registered for the festival and a wait-list started for Oct 2015.  Sixty high school student leaders have been confirmed and set to deliver stations over the duration of the festival.  Our incredible environmental partner hosts have programmed excellent hands-on educational stations for students, which align with British Columbia school curriculum.
Help us finish and bring some great kids to learn about nature and open up their minds to the potential they hold as environmentally conscious citizens.  Your pledge could mean a world of difference to someone.  Every environmentalist started with a valuable interaction with nature. 

Your Impact

Providing us the funding for bus transportation to help us connect 432 students to nature.
Supporting a great opportunity to educate the students on the importance of nature and environment and their interdependence on it.

Helping to engage students to nature through hands-on experience  in an out-door learning environment 


Encouraging and fostering environmentally responsible citizens.

Building and empowering young leaders in the community.


 The PerksWe want to reward you for your journey with us.  We tried to keep the cost of the perks low so we can put as much money as possible into the program, but I think there are some pretty invaluable perks that come straight from the people who you will be helping out.  Take a look to see what may interest you. Stretch GoalIf we're somehow lucky enough to achieve our funding goal, we won`t stop there! Additional funding will allow us to cover the remaining operational costs and continue to develop the festival for the following years.  We have a large demand for outdoor educational programs, but we can`t make it happen without funding!
 Our Sponsors
We've been very lucky to have some great supporters and help along the way.  We want to recognize those who are helping us along our journey, whether it be big or small.  Thank you and the kids will thank you too!

Together you can direct, design and create your own stage performance. The Interactive Stage is an open-ended toy that:• Incorporates,theater arts, engineering, visual programming and storytelling. It sparks creativity and imagination  • Empowers and motivates self-directed discovery and learning• Ideal for ages 5-10Our Baby Monster Group StoryMy husband and I are both engineers and together we have two daughters. As we raised them we looked for toys to get them interested in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math), but we soon found that none of the STEM toys we bought held the interest of our daughters for long. Many parents encounter this issue but rather than be dissuaded by the STEM toy options out there, we decided that we'd try to change the landscape by inventing our own product.Hear from Linda Chen, the founder of Baby Monster Group:
 
For backing at $75 level, you will get one manufactured Interactive Stage diorama kit and its software
 Our third version of the prototype will soon be ready for manufacturing.   In this version, you will have a software application optimized for young children's experiential programming through real-time feedback of all the electronics.  As our early backer, you will receive all software feature improvement and updates that can grow with your child's continuing interest in performing arts.  This version of the hardware will include a robust theater stage for placing LED light strips, a motor, an RFID sensor and a micro-controller.  It will also come with RFID stickers, puppet stands and puppet templates.  The electronics are transportable to any existing play-set that your child already owns. While it is our first time doing so, we have experienced companies to guide us through the process.  The biggest challenge is the high cost of manufacturing and shipping, but we have consulted many experts to get the best estimates possible for getting the product manufactured, tested and shipped to final users.  Our goal of $25,000 is the best estimate for minimum manufacturing order.    The ImpactResearch tells us that those who are underrepresented in STEM fields need to be encouraged early on.  

 
According to The Harris Project:Only 1 in 5 students feel “very confident” when it comes to learning STEAM subjects. And hands-on learning tools have the potential to improve educational outcomes that prepare students for the future.According to Claire Shipman, author of The Confidence Code for Girls:Between elementary school and high school, girls experience a 30% drop in confidence. Interactive Stage Projects That Our Students Have Created:      Over the past two years, we have inspired over 200 students to create original stories, parades and concerts with the Interactive Stage at our workshops and after school programs.  We’ve seen students' excitement as they begin with creating a show from scratch and moving along to programming lights and motors. All the while, they are just doing what they do best, imagining and playing. Furthermore, they are being exposed to engineering and programming without being formally instructed to do so.

<h2><strong>A TEACHER AFFECTS ETERNITY!</strong></h2>
<p>My name is Pat Cruz. I believe that as educators, we have the superpower to inform communities and inspire grassroots action. This is why I started <a href=""https://teach-arts.sharetribe.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Transcontinental Educator Artist Collective for Humanity = TEACH</a>.</p>
<p>I believe Greta Thunberg: we are in a climate emergency! This young woman has done more to raise environmental awareness than any government entity and she has inspired me to take action. I realized, if this young student can accomplish this, <i>imagine what we educators can do?</i></p>
<p>This is why we created the <strong>TEACH ClimateChangeAgents Project</strong>.</p>
<h3>
<strong>OUR GOAL</strong>: </h3>
<h3>Activate Climate Change Initiatives in Communities Across the Globe through STEAM &amp; Arts Integration.</h3>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>OUR PLAN: 2 Fold - July 2021</strong></h3>
<p><i>1 - TEACH Climate Change Virtual Conference:</i> will include: asynchronous workshops, keynotes, as will as live, interactive, arts integrated and STEAM workshops as well as discussion groups scheduled for different time zones. </p>
<p><i>2 - TEACH ClimateChangeAgents Institute: </i>A four day in-person institute with keynotes, interactive workshops, and room and board in Northern Italy. The institute will culminate STEAM presentations by participants which will be included in the Virtual Conference. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>YOUR IMPACT: </strong></h3>
<p>ALL proceeds go towards the <strong><a href=""https://teach-arts.sharetribe.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TEACH ClimateChangeAgents Project</a>, </strong>which includes a Virtual Conference for up to 1000 educators, and an in-person institute in Italy for 15 or more educator leaders from around the world!</p>
<p>We feel it is important for this professional development to be available to ALL teachers, regardless of income.  This is why we hope to exceed our goal so that, in addition to providing free training, room, and board, we may also provide a travel stipend for all participants attending from outside of Europe. </p>

<h3>
<strong>OUR TRACK RECORD: </strong> </h3>
<p>We have a strong team of STEAM educators/teaching artists who each have over 20 years of experience in education. Meet our TEACH TEAM:</p>

<h3><strong>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</strong></h3>
<p>If we fail to raise the full $30,000, we will design this program like a typical Institute (the old way) - where only those who can afford to attend participate. But, we believe there is a better way.

My name is Pat Cruz. I believe that as educators, we have the superpower to inform communities and inspire grassroots action. This is why I started The Transcontinental Educator Artist Collective for Humanity = TEACH.
I believe Greta Thunberg: we are in a climate emergency! This young woman has done more to raise environmental awareness than any government entity and she has inspired me to take action. I realized, if this young student can accomplish this, imagine what we educators can do?
This is why we created the TEACH ClimateChangeAgents Project.

OUR GOAL: 
Activate Climate Change Initiatives in Communities Across the Globe through STEAM & Arts Integration.
 
OUR PLAN: 2 Fold - July 2021
1 - TEACH Climate Change Virtual Conference: will include: asynchronous workshops, keynotes, as will as live, interactive, arts integrated and STEAM workshops as well as discussion groups scheduled for different time zones. 
2 - TEACH ClimateChangeAgents Institute: A four day in-person institute with keynotes, interactive workshops, and room and board in Northern Italy. The institute will culminate STEAM presentations by participants which will be included in the Virtual Conference. 
 
YOUR IMPACT: 
ALL proceeds go towards the TEACH ClimateChangeAgents Project, which includes a Virtual Conference for up to 1000 educators, and an in-person institute in Italy for 15 or more educator leaders from around the world!
We feel it is important for this professional development to be available to ALL teachers, regardless of income.  This is why we hope to exceed our goal so that, in addition to providing free training, room, and board, we may also provide a travel stipend for all participants attending from outside of Europe. 

 

OUR TRACK RECORD:  
We have a strong team of STEAM educators/teaching artists who each have over 20 years of experience in education. Meet our TEACH TEAM:
Fernanda Aller, Scientist in Residence. Fer has a multidisciplinary background in Engineering, Agriculture Environmental Science with a postgraduate Sustainable Value Chain. This background has been essential to developing and work across different industries. Fer will speak on what we can do on a local level protect soil fertility to grow sustainable food with fewer resources and to produce affordable green energy to fight climate change.
Tambra Harris, Featured Teaching Artist. Tambra is Artistic Director of Giwayen Mata an award winning Dance, Percussion, and vocal ensemble that celebrates the richness of traditional Afrika. Tambra successfully developed the K-12 dance program at Atlanta’s first charter school, Charles R. Drew where her curriculum specialized in STEAM and arts integration, unifying the school community through African culture and the core values of Project Based Learning. 
Jeff Mather, Featured Teaching Artist. Jeff is a sculptor and interdisciplinary teaching artist. Since 2012 Jeff has served as the STEAM Artist in Residence at Drew Charter School, the first STEAM-certified charter school in Georgia. Since 2012 Mather has also worked at the Beverly Taylor Sorenson Arts Access program in Utah, a full inclusion arts program. When directing public art projects he always works in collaboration with other artists and community members. He is also a facilitator with Alternate ROOTS' Resources for Social Change training team.
John Morogiello, Facilitator. Artistic Director of Best Medicine Rep Theater Company and an Award Winning International Playwright.  His Engaging Shaw (Old Globe, Vienna’s English Theatre in Austria, New Jersey Rep, Oldcastle, and Abingdon Theatre Company off-Broadway) and Blame It On Beckett (Colony Theatre, Abingdon) have both been published by Samuel French. John provides playwriting residencies through The Maryland State Arts Council. He served as performing artists facilitator for the Teaching Artists Institute in for many years.
Federico Colombo, Facilitator -  docente di sostegno presso IC Silvio Pellico - Vedano Olona, Cultore della Materia, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore. Federico is a great educator and university professor who integrates the arts with physics in the primary grades. Federico is a community connector who seems to know everyone in Italy! He has coordinated our partnership with the Astronomical Observatory Foundation of Tradate. He is also the founder of the STEAM and Arts Integration in Education group in Italy.
Pat Cruz, Director. I have been facilitating and directing Institutes for over 2 decades.  I worked for the Maryland State Board of Education's summer arts integration institute, MATI, for over a decade. I have taught arts integration courses at Towson University and University of Maryland in Baltimore County (UMBC). I am the founding director of the Teaching Artists Institute in Maryland. I am honored to have been recognized by my peers in 2017 when I received the Linda Popp Leadership Award from The Maryland Art Education Association in 2017.
We will utilize Wiggins and McTighe's Understanding By Design (UbD) framework and Design thinking, a human-centered approach to innovation.
 
OUR PARTNERS:
Astronomical Observatory Foundation of Tradate ""Messier 13""
STEAM & Arts Integration in Education
Taikoza EastWinds Non-Profit
Graduate Credit available through UMBC - University of Maryland Baltimore County

 
RISKS & CHALLENGES
If we fail to raise the full $30,000, we will design this program like a typical Institute (the old way) - where only those who can afford to attend participate. But, we believe there is a better way. We believe by hosting a Creative Challenge to select the participating teachers we will find the dynamic educational leaders who will inspire others to become environmental citizens who take immediate action.
If we fail to meet our goal we will offer spots for sale in January 2021. We will offer one or more free spots, based on how much we raise ($1500 = 1 free spot). 
If the pandemic makes it impossible to conduct the institute in July 2021, then we will host a virtual conference in July 2021, and postpone the in-person Institute until July 2022.

<p>We are looking for people like you to join our team to establish Organic Farming Demonstration Farms that train youths, women and agricultural students in Africa.</p>
<p>Through our practical and academic experience, we have designed a system that can use Organic Farms to create more economic opportunities and leverage Africa's youth demographic and agricultural natural resources advantages. We designed the system to be self-sustaining and we called it STAC - which means Smart Transfer of Agro Capacities (STAC). It is a combination of Smart Tools and training systems for improved agricultural productivity. We designed it as a capacity-building strategy that affords the participant to acquire the knowledge and technical skills needed to be self-employed or employable. Each unit of STAC will train 100 youths practical skills needed to operate a successful and profitable organic farm.</p>

<p>Even though each unit of STAC will be self-sustaining once established, we still need help from people like you. We need funds to establish the first set of demonstration farms. These demonstration farms can unlock the potential of thousands of youths in Africa and contribute to global food security and sustainable development.</p>
<p>Will you support us and together inspire a critical mass of agricultural entrepreneurs, innovators, and change-makers in Africa?</p>
<h3><strong>Why the campaign?</strong></h3>
<p>We need $15,000 to establish each of the Organic Agriculture Demonstration Farm. All the money generated through this campaign will be used for two things:</p>

<p><strong>Project summary</strong></p>
<p><i>What is this project?</i><br/><br/>This project is an indoor international children's play center, where kids can build lifelong fun experiences through three creative play areas. We will provide an indoor playground, theater area for performing arts and children events, along with a science and discover area.<br/> </p>
<p><i>How will the funds bring it to life?</i></p>
<p>The costed are derived from leasing of the facility in Leipzig, Germany, design production &amp; renovation, marketing, exhibits, man-power, and fabrication. We will also be hosting a bio-based cafe area which provides healthy balanced snacks and beverages for our guest to purchase. </p> <p><i>Who is the creator?</i></p>
<p>The founder is DeLondon Hawthorne, a father, a business owner and sports trainer for kids from Chicago, USA. He is living since the last year in Leipzig, Germany and he is trying to make a difference in the german community and bring something new to the city. </p> <p><strong>Project description</strong></p>
<p>We are raising funds to bring to the city of Leipzig, Germany a new concept in child growth and learning through play. We are looking to lease, what once was an old grocery store operation and transforming the space into a wonderful indoor play and learning center for kids ages 1-10 to participate in montessori style games and activities. The aim is to have children find ways on their own to be creative and develop life long memories that will remain for a lifetime.</p>
<p>I believe in the magic of children and with the right resources presented to them their power to be inspiring and creative is unmeasurable. We live in a highly technological world, where to often we are not allowed to express our true talents. Through natural play and discovery, I believe that talent can be found again and adored.

</div></div>","Project summary
What is this project?This project is an indoor international children's play center, where kids can build lifelong fun experiences through three creative play areas. We will provide an indoor playground, theater area for performing arts and children events, along with a science and discover area. 
How will the funds bring it to life?
The costed are derived from leasing of the facility in Leipzig, Germany, design production & renovation, marketing, exhibits, man-power, and fabrication. We will also be hosting a bio-based cafe area which provides healthy balanced snacks and beverages for our guest to purchase.  Who is the creator?
The founder is DeLondon Hawthorne, a father, a business owner and sports trainer for kids from Chicago, USA. He is living since the last year in Leipzig, Germany and he is trying to make a difference in the german community and bring something new to the city.  Project description
We are raising funds to bring to the city of Leipzig, Germany a new concept in child growth and learning through play. We are looking to lease, what once was an old grocery store operation and transforming the space into a wonderful indoor play and learning center for kids ages 1-10 to participate in montessori style games and activities. The aim is to have children find ways on their own to be creative and develop life long memories that will remain for a lifetime.
I believe in the magic of children and with the right resources presented to them their power to be inspiring and creative is unmeasurable. We live in a highly technological world, where to often we are not allowed to express our true talents. Through natural play and discovery, I believe that talent can be found again and adored. The Wonder Works, as the name portrays, provides such an environment for a child to display their potentials through constructive play. 

Our plan will be to build a three section play area, which will include; a tree house play  area with a two small pretend villages namely a bakery and an animal hospital, a theater stage area where kids can make their own performances and productions from various back-drops and costumes, and thirdly an area hosting a natural science and exhibition center with thinking games, experiments, water crafts, and so much more.

<h1>Short Summary</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Eli Willner, President of Trebuchet (a five-year old
New York based services firm), originator of the TutorToot concept (this campaign!), a parent and a one-time teacher. My colleagues
and I have long been concerned about the less-than-ideal state of education in
the US and wondered what we could do about it.</p>
<p>When we were kids our parents always helped us with our
homework. Without that help we might have just given up and fallen behind. But
many kids today, especially from disadvantaged areas, don't have anyone they
can turn to at home for homework help. And they can't afford to pay for tutors,
either.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/947355/files/20141021012500-folorn_student.jpg?1413879900"" src="""" style=""width: 322.961373390558px; height: 215px;""/></p>
<p>Our core team at Trebuchet was previously involved in the
creation and launch of an online tutoring service. It occurred to us that we
could leverage our experience and customize a similar service to provide
surrogate ""parent-like homework assistance"", online, to kids who need
it.</p>
<p>The key idea here is that this service will be
self-sustaining because it will have a commercial as well as an altruistic
side. We will charge those who can afford to pay and use part of our revenues
to fund free services for those who cannot afford to pay. We will motivate our
tutors to accept less or no pay when they're helping disadvantaged students by
giving them priority when they're helping paying students.</p>
<p>Your participation in our campaign will enable us to help
kids all over the country succeed by improving their out-of-school learning
experience. We will start by improving education in America one student at a
time. But as we grow we just might revolutionize education in America by
creating large communities of teachers and students who will serve as a
positive force in restoring America's preeminent educational position. Wouldn't
it be awesome to be a part of something this huge?</p>
<p></p>

<p>
</p>
<h1>What We Need and Why</h1>
<p>We've been nurturing this idea for a while and have a
well-thought out game plan. Our functional spec, business model and marketing
approach have been completed and we have even designed most of our app
screens.  We need your help to fund the
following items in order to make the plan a reality.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Application development -
We've designed and are going to code a really cool app that students will love
and that will run on just about every smart phone, tablet and desktop PC out
there. We've done development work of this scope before and will be working
with development partners we're familiar with and confident in. </span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">IT infrastructure - We've
selected our hosting partner - also familiar to us - and scoped out our initial
IT infrastructure requirements. </span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Market analysis - When it
comes to determining the ""sweet spot"" for pricing the service to our
paying customers we don't want to play guessing games. Nor do we want to take a
seat-of-the-pants approach in determining the sweet spot for tutor
compensation. The objective is to maximize the number of paying students and
active tutors while maintaining enough of a margin to pay for the qualifying non-paying students and have some profit left over at the end of the day. The analysis has
to be done scientifically, by professionals, so we will be engaging a market
research firm to do it for us.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Publicity and marketing -
We want to hit the ground running and gather a critical mass of students and
tutors in as short a time as possible. We want to get the word out about the
availability of the free service to organizations serving disadvantaged
communities in as broad-based a manner as possible. That takes work and costs
money.</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Startup operating expenses</span></li>
</ul>
<p>We seek to raise $75,000 with your
help. That's not a small amount of money but given the scope of what we're trying
to accomplish it's really a very frugal budget. We will be able to carry our
other costs with current and future capital investments and our projected first year earnings and
plan to be self-sustaining after that.</p>
<h2>What if...</h2>
<p>In the event we don't raise the full amount our fall-back
plan will enable us to launch in scaled down fashion. We won't compromise on
our primary objective of providing free ""parent-like homework
assistance"" to disadvantaged kids. But we will spend less on
infrastructure and marketing and scale back our projected growth numbers
accordingly. </p>
<p>On the other hand if, with your support, we exceed our
funding goal we will be able to accelerate our growth plan and reach more kids
who need the free service (and of course more paying customers to help support
it) more quickly. Our app Release 2 is already on the drawing boards and has
tons of slick new features. With additional funds we can accelerate the process
of getting Release 2 into the hands of students who will benefit from it the
most.</p>
<h1>What's In It for You?</h1>
<p>The biggest reward for supporting our project is the
knowledge that you are doing something concrete and meaningful to improve the
quality of education in America. At a minimum you'll be helping individual
underprivileged students. Changing lives, one by one. And if our project
snowballs as we expect it to it can truly revolutionize our educational system!
Thus, all Indiegogo contributors will be listed and recognized on our website
in perpetuity. You will have played a pivotal role in this endeavor and you
deserve to be enshrined forever on our Wall of Fame! </p>
<p>But we would like to express our gratitude in more concrete
ways as well so we've assembled a tantalizing array of perks including,</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A really nice pen/stylus</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A clip-on mirror so you can
see the face of... your own face!</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Our ""official
issue"" colorful company tee-shirt</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">And of course, an array of
different subscription plans to the service - for kids in your own family and
for kids who can't afford the service themselves</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, by funding us you are rewarding yourself nicely as well
- a true win-win!</p>

<h1>Service Details</h1>
<p>Our model for an online homework platform is “cool”, light
and suited primarily to ad hoc questions that need quick answers, with
explanations - in short, that will help students with their homework just like
Mom and Dad helped us.</p>
<p>Many students today want instant gratification – they often
function in “last minute” mode and are reluctant to plan or pre-schedule even
activities that they concede are necessary, such as school work or test preparation.
Many students today are uninterested in formalities or hurdles of any kind that
have to be overcome before getting the information they require. They will not
tolerate impediments that stand between their needs and the satisfaction of
those needs. Students, and especially teens, are notorious followers of the
herd instinct. They seek to do what is popular among their peers; what is
perceived as “cool”. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/947359/files/20141021012911-cool_herd.jpg?1413880151"" src="""" style=""width: 420.571428571429px; height: 280px;""/></p>
<p>Our online homework platform is aimed at today’s student.
After a brief one-time setup students merely have to select their subject
(their grade level and other relevant details are already in the system) and
enter their questions into a simple, user-friendly app that runs on all
platforms.</p>
<p>The question is broadcast to a team of tutors qualified in the
student’s grade level and subject. The student will typically receive a
response within seconds of sending the question. Follow up questions are
permitted; the goal is to provide gratification in as complete and quick a
manner as possible.</p>
<p>The experience is designed to be appealing in every respect.
In addition to providing clear, concise and accurate answers the app will have
engaging graphics, a catchy name and “concept” and slick and memorable effects
that enhance the cool factor without being obtrusive.</p>

<p>
</p>
<h1>The Name</h1>
<p>We're calling our service ""Tutor Toot"" to convey a
sense of whimsy and fun and we're calling the student questions
""toots"" because they will be short and sweet; quick outreaches for
assistance that will evoke near-instant responses. We hope the name catches on!</p>
<p></p>

<h1>The State of Education in the US</h1>
<p><b>Here’s some sobering
data: despite lowering standards, about 20% of all students who enter high
school in the USA never graduate. In some low-income areas a staggering 41%
never graduate. [Data from “Public High School Four-Year On-Time Graduation
Rates and Event Dropout Rates” US Department of Education, April 2014.] Contrast
with Finland, for example, where only 7% of students don’t graduate. Not
coincidentally, in Finland 30% of children receive extra help during their
first nine years of school. It is clear that out-of-school learning (i.e. homework)
is a critical component of the learning process – and that parents today are
simply not able to supply that extra help.</b></p>
<p></p>
<h2>The Teaching Model for Our Times</h2>
<p>Students sometimes
have difficulty focusing in traditional classroom settings but they may be more
amenable to learning via the quick interactions that will be the norm on our
platform, which resemble traditional parent-provided homework help. While this
is not an educational panacea it should mitigate towards more effective
learning, in conjunction with other improvements that are being made in the US
educational system.</p>
<h2>Free to Those with a Need and No Means</h2>
<p>It is an unfortunate fact that often, the students most
in the need of the kind of service our platform will provide cannot afford to
pay for it. <b>Our system introduces a major innovation to address this problem.
It is built from the ground up to support provision of free services (of the
same quality made available to paying customers) to students in depressed
economic areas who cannot afford to pay for the service. </b></p>
<p>Our plan is to fund the free service in three ways. </p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">First, we will pay the
costs of offering the free service out of revenues from the paid service.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Second, we will lower our
out-of-pocket costs for the free service by creating incentives for tutors to
respond to free questions with little or no remuneration. We will do this by favoring
those tutors with priority on paid questions.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Third, we will seek funding
from public and private sources that provide grants to fund educational
services in disadvantaged areas and we will work through local educational
non-profits to leverage grants that may already be in place, in exchange for
providing their students free access to our system.</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Why Us?</h1>
<p>Because our background and experience uniquely qualify us
for this role. </p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We are a technology firm

and we know first-hand of the problems that can arise in such an undertaking -

</li>
</ul>
<h1>Risks &amp; Challenges</h1>
<h2>Will They Come?</h2>
<p>While we don't doubt that we can build it, the question is,
will they come? That, of course, is the risk inherent in any new service
offering. We are confident that we have a handle on the variables under our
control but there are always variables that we can't control. Nonetheless our
experienced team is doing their utmost to leave nothing to chance. We’re planning on
advertising in online and print media, contacting schools and parent organizations
directly and otherwise engaging in an aggressive outreach campaign. We’ve
already established relationships with numerous non-profits that specialize in
K-12 education and we will be leveraging those relationships to identify
students who qualify for the free service.</p>
<p>And we
believe the odds are in our favor. The team is really pumped about the
potential of this project and really excited about this Indiegogo campaign!</p>
<h2>The Business Model</h2>
<p>We will engage a professional firm to assist us in our
market analysis so that we charge our paying customers enough to cover our
costs but not so much that we'll drive them away.They'll also help us determine
how much to pay our tutors so that it's a worthwhile undertaking for them while
not breaking the bank. There is always a risk that the professional firm will
be wrong. But we'll be mitigating that risk ahead of time by selecting the firm
very carefully and by watching our post-launch bottom line very closely, so
that if errors were made we'll catch them and make adjustments quickly.</p>
<h2>Competition</h2>
<p>All successful businesses run the ""copycat risk"".
But we pride ourselves on our creativity - that's how we came up with the idea
and the implementation plan in the first place - and we intend to stay ahead of
the competition by continually exercising our creativity and not resting on our
laurels. You'll be amazed at some of the tricks that we have up our sleeve for
the future! And of course we'll have ""first mover advantage"" in our
favor as well.</p>
<h1>Other Ways You Can Help</h1>
<p>We hope that you're impressed enough by our project to
contribute to the maximum extent that you're able. And we'd like you to help by
telling your friends about us as well. Please help us get out the word about
this important project! Use email, use the Indiegogo share tools, use mail and
pony express!</p>
<p>And if you can't contribute financially, that's ok - but we
would still appreciate your assistance in spreading the word!</p>

<h1><br/></h1>
<h1>=========================</h1>
<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<br/><h1 style=""display: inline !important;""></h1>
<h2>General Service</h2>
<p><b>1. 
</b><b>Will this be a
simple “cheat” for students to avoid having to work on their homework
themselves?</b></p>
<p><i>No, not at all! Tutors will be trained to guide
students toward understanding the material and arriving at correct answers themselves
– just like good parents help their kids!</i></p>
<p><b>2. 
</b><b>Can students select
which tutors they want to direct their questions to?</b></p>
<p><i>In the initial release of the service students
will be assigned the first available tutor from our highly qualified pool who
is approved for the student’s grade level and subject. Tutors are identified by
unique “handles” but are otherwise anonymous. Future releases of the service
will allow students to specify by “handle” either a “preference” for a
particular tutor (if that tutor is online he or she will be given an exclusive
window in which to respond after which the question will be assigned to the
general tutor pool) or a “requirement” for a particular tutor (if that tutor is
offline or does not respond to the question within the exclusive window the
question will be withdrawn and not be assigned to the general tutor pool).</i></p>
<p><b>3. 
</b><b>How will students be
protected against improper tutor contacts?</b></p>
<p><i>Prospective tutors will undergo extensive
background checks by a reputable nationwide agency specializing in employment
background checking and only tutors will clean records will be hired. Tutors
will be instructed that all contacts with students must be maintained at the
highest professional level and must not deviate into personal conversation and
will be informed that indiscretions will result in immediate dismissal. All
tutor-student interactions will be recorded and securely preserved and will be
monitored by software in real-time to detect and flag potentially troublesome
interactions. When these are detected a Tutor Toot staff member will review the
interaction and terminate it immediately if it is problematic, following up
with appropriate action aimed at the tutor and/or student.</i></p>
<p><b>4. 
</b><b>What grade levels
and subjects will be covered by the service?</b></p>
<p><i>The initial release of the service will cover all
subjects commonly taught in grades 6-12 in the USA. Future releases will also
cover standard college prep and select college level courses.</i></p>
<p><b>5. 
</b><b>Will you support
scheduled, longer-duration tutoring sessions as well as the “toot” concept?</b></p>
<p><i>The initial release of the service will focus on
responding to ad hoc questions that typically arise when a student is doing
homework, studying or reviewing school work at home. Future releases of the
service will support scheduled longer-term learning sessions with student’s
choice of tutor.</i></p>
<p><b>6. 
</b><b>What are the payment
models for paying students?</b></p>
<p><i>Students will be able to pay per question
(includes as much dialogue as necessary to resolve the question) or purchase a
monthly subscription that will entitle them to an as-yet-to-be-determined (but
substantial) amount of questions.</i></p>
<p><b>7. 
</b><b>What will the fees
be for paying students?</b></p>
<p><i>The fee structure has not yet been determined but
the goal is to make the service as affordable as possible for the paying
students – if a student needs help we don’t want them to have to think twice
before utilizing our service.</i></p>
<p><b>8. 
</b><b>Will you offer
peer-to-peer (student to student) communication capability?</b></p>
<p><i>We are very interested in building a large opt-in
community of both students and tutors who can dialogue outside the context of a
formal “toot” or tutoring session and we plan to do so, once we work out an
ironclad system to prevent abuse of the system and to protect our student and
tutor members. This functionality will not be available in the initial release
of the service.</i></p>
<p><b>9. 
</b><b>Will transcripts of
tutoring dialogues be made available to outside parties?</b></p>
<p><i>All transcripts will be kept in strictest
confidence in a secure offline facility and will be revealed to outside third parties
only under legal compulsion. We are working on a permission-based set of rules
that may allow for selective sharing of transcripts with parents, teachers and
other parties with a legitimate interest in a student’s learning progress but
this will not be available in the initial release of the service. We stress
that no transcript will be released without student and parent explicit
consent.</i></p>
<p><b>10. 
</b><b>What kinds of data
will you be gathering about students and tutors?</b></p>
<p><i>Will we be monitoring tutor ratings with an eye to
improving tutor effectiveness. We will also monitor the kinds of questions we
are getting from students on an overall, regional and seasonal basis in order
to better prepare our tutors for the kinds of questions they should be
expecting, again, in order to improve tutor effectiveness. All data collected
will be anonymized and under no circumstances will the questions of a
particular student be shared with third parties.</i></p>
<p><b>11. 
</b><b>What determines
which tutor will answer a student question?</b></p>
<p><i>The tutor assignment algorithm is as follows: the
question is broadcast only to tutors who are online and have been certified in
the grade and subject area of the question. For paying students, preference is
given to tutors who most actively respond to qualifying free students, and the
more active a tutor is in responding to those questions, the greater the
preference that tutor receives. “Preference” means that those tutors have a
brief window during which only they can “take” a question. However the primary
objective is to get a response to the student as soon as possible so the window
of exclusivity is small, and when it expires the question is broadcast to the
entire tutor base (that is, all online tutors who are certified in the
appropriate grade and subject area).</i></p>
<p><i>For non-paying students the question is
immediately broadcast to the entire qualifying tutor base and no preference is
given.</i></p>
<p><i>Once a tutor “takes” a question other tutors are
locked out of taking it but if the “taking” tutor does not respond to the
question within a very narrow response window, the question is returned to the
tutor pool and other qualifying tutors may “take” it.</i></p>
<p><b>12. 
</b><b>What are the hours
of operation?</b></p>

Hi, I'm Eli Willner, President of Trebuchet (a five-year old
New York based services firm), originator of the TutorToot concept (this campaign!), a parent and a one-time teacher. My colleagues
and I have long been concerned about the less-than-ideal state of education in
the US and wondered what we could do about it.
When we were kids our parents always helped us with our
homework. Without that help we might have just given up and fallen behind. But
many kids today, especially from disadvantaged areas, don't have anyone they
can turn to at home for homework help. And they can't afford to pay for tutors,
either.


Our core team at Trebuchet was previously involved in the
creation and launch of an online tutoring service. It occurred to us that we
could leverage our experience and customize a similar service to provide
surrogate ""parent-like homework assistance"", online, to kids who need
it.
The key idea here is that this service will be
self-sustaining because it will have a commercial as well as an altruistic
side. We will charge those who can afford to pay and use part of our revenues
to fund free services for those who cannot afford to pay. We will motivate our
tutors to accept less or no pay when they're helping disadvantaged students by
giving them priority when they're helping paying students.
Your participation in our campaign will enable us to help
kids all over the country succeed by improving their out-of-school learning
experience. We will start by improving education in America one student at a
time. But as we grow we just might revolutionize education in America by
creating large communities of teachers and students who will serve as a
positive force in restoring America's preeminent educational position. Wouldn't
it be awesome to be a part of something this huge?




What We Need and Why
We've been nurturing this idea for a while and have a
well-thought out game plan. Our functional spec, business model and marketing
approach have been completed and we have even designed most of our app
screens.  We need your help to fund the
following items in order to make the plan a reality.



Application development -
We've designed and are going to code a really cool app that students will love
and that will run on just about every smart phone, tablet and desktop PC out
there. We've done development work of this scope before and will be working
with development partners we're familiar with and confident in. 


IT infrastructure - We've
selected our hosting partner - also familiar to us - and scoped out our initial
IT infrastructure requirements. 


Market analysis - When it
comes to determining the ""sweet spot"" for pricing the service to our
paying customers we don't want to play guessing games. Nor do we want to take a
seat-of-the-pants approach in determining the sweet spot for tutor
compensation. The objective is to maximize the number of paying students and
active tutors while maintaining enough of a margin to pay for the qualifying non-paying students and have some profit left over at the end of the day. The analysis has
to be done scientifically, by professionals, so we will be engaging a market
research firm to do it for us.


Publicity and marketing -
We want to hit the ground running and gather a critical mass of students and
tutors in as short a time as possible. We want to get the word out about the
availability of the free service to organizations serving disadvantaged
communities in as broad-based a manner as possible. That takes work and costs
money.

Startup operating expenses

We seek to raise $75,000 with your
help. That's not a small amount of money but given the scope of what we're trying
to accomplish it's really a very frugal budget. We will be able to carry our
other costs with current and future capital investments and our projected first year earnings and
plan to be self-sustaining after that.
What if...
In the event we don't raise the full amount our fall-back
plan will enable us to launch in scaled down fashion. We won't compromise on
our primary objective of providing free ""parent-like homework
assistance"" to disadvantaged kids. But we will spend less on
infrastructure and marketing and scale back our projected growth numbers
accordingly. 
On the other hand if, with your support, we exceed our
funding goal we will be able to accelerate our growth plan and reach more kids
who need the free service (and of course more paying customers to help support
it) more quickly. Our app Release 2 is already on the drawing boards and has
tons of slick new features. With additional funds we can accelerate the process
of getting Release 2 into the hands of students who will benefit from it the
most.
What's In It for You?
The biggest reward for supporting our project is the
knowledge that you are doing something concrete and meaningful to improve the
quality of education in America. At a minimum you'll be helping individual
underprivileged students. Changing lives, one by one. And if our project
snowballs as we expect it to it can truly revolutionize our educational system!
Thus, all Indiegogo contributors will be listed and recognized on our website
in perpetuity. You will have played a pivotal role in this endeavor and you
deserve to be enshrined forever on our Wall of Fame! 
But we would like to express our gratitude in more concrete
ways as well so we've assembled a tantalizing array of perks including,



A really nice pen/stylus


A clip-on mirror so you can
see the face of... your own face!


Our ""official
issue"" colorful company tee-shirt


And of course, an array of
different subscription plans to the service - for kids in your own family and
for kids who can't afford the service themselves


So, by funding us you are rewarding yourself nicely as well
- a true win-win!


Service Details
Our model for an online homework platform is “cool”, light
and suited primarily to ad hoc questions that need quick answers, with
explanations - in short, that will help students with their homework just like
Mom and Dad helped us.
Many students today want instant gratification – they often
function in “last minute” mode and are reluctant to plan or pre-schedule even
activities that they concede are necessary, such as school work or test preparation.
Many students today are uninterested in formalities or hurdles of any kind that
have to be overcome before getting the information they require. They will not
tolerate impediments that stand between their needs and the satisfaction of
those needs. Students, and especially teens, are notorious followers of the
herd instinct. They seek to do what is popular among their peers; what is
perceived as “cool”. 


Our online homework platform is aimed at today’s student.
After a brief one-time setup students merely have to select their subject
(their grade level and other relevant details are already in the system) and
enter their questions into a simple, user-friendly app that runs on all
platforms.
The question is broadcast to a team of tutors qualified in the
student’s grade level and subject. The student will typically receive a
response within seconds of sending the question. Follow up questions are
permitted; the goal is to provide gratification in as complete and quick a
manner as possible.
The experience is designed to be appealing in every respect.
In addition to providing clear, concise and accurate answers the app will have
engaging graphics, a catchy name and “concept” and slick and memorable effects
that enhance the cool factor without being obtrusive.




The Name
We're calling our service ""Tutor Toot"" to convey a
sense of whimsy and fun and we're calling the student questions
""toots"" because they will be short and sweet; quick outreaches for
assistance that will evoke near-instant responses. We hope the name catches on!






The State of Education in the US
Here’s some sobering
data: despite lowering standards, about 20% of all students who enter high
school in the USA never graduate. In some low-income areas a staggering 41%
never graduate. [Data from “Public High School Four-Year On-Time Graduation
Rates and Event Dropout Rates” US Department of Education, April 2014.] Contrast
with Finland, for example, where only 7% of students don’t graduate. Not
coincidentally, in Finland 30% of children receive extra help during their
first nine years of school. It is clear that out-of-school learning (i.e. homework)
is a critical component of the learning process – and that parents today are
simply not able to supply that extra help.

The Teaching Model for Our Times
Students sometimes
have difficulty focusing in traditional classroom settings but they may be more
amenable to learning via the quick interactions that will be the norm on our
platform, which resemble traditional parent-provided homework help. While this
is not an educational panacea it should mitigate towards more effective
learning, in conjunction with other improvements that are being made in the US
educational system.
Free to Those with a Need and No Means
It is an unfortunate fact that often, the students most
in the need of the kind of service our platform will provide cannot afford to
pay for it. Our system introduces a major innovation to address this problem.
It is built from the ground up to support provision of free services (of the
same quality made available to paying customers) to students in depressed
economic areas who cannot afford to pay for the service. 
Our plan is to fund the free service in three ways. 



First, we will pay the
costs of offering the free service out of revenues from the paid service.


Second, we will lower our
out-of-pocket costs for the free service by creating incentives for tutors to
respond to free questions with little or no remuneration. We will do this by favoring
those tutors with priority on paid questions.


Third, we will seek funding
from public and private sources that provide grants to fund educational
services in disadvantaged areas and we will work through local educational
non-profits to leverage grants that may already be in place, in exchange for
providing their students free access to our system.


Why Us?
Because our background and experience uniquely qualify us
for this role. 



We are a technology firm
with experience building large, scalable client-server systems (that's tech
speak for the kind of platform our online homework service will be)


We are a services firm with
a client-centric corporate culture


We are parents ourselves
and have personal experience with the difficulties of balancing our
professional lives with the homework assistance needs of our children


Some of us are teachers and are pained at the price kids pay, and the price America pays,
because too many kids are deprived of the learning help they need outside the
school environment


Our core team was
previously involved in the creation and launch of an online tutoring service
and we know first-hand of the problems that can arise in such an undertaking -
and we know their solutions


Risks & Challenges
Will They Come?
While we don't doubt that we can build it, the question is,
will they come? That, of course, is the risk inherent in any new service
offering. We are confident that we have a handle on the variables under our
control but there are always variables that we can't control. Nonetheless our
experienced team is doing their utmost to leave nothing to chance. We’re planning on
advertising in online and print media, contacting schools and parent organizations
directly and otherwise engaging in an aggressive outreach campaign. We’ve
already established relationships with numerous non-profits that specialize in
K-12 education and we will be leveraging those relationships to identify
students who qualify for the free service.
And we
believe the odds are in our favor. The team is really pumped about the
potential of this project and really excited about this Indiegogo campaign!
The Business Model
We will engage a professional firm to assist us in our
market analysis so that we charge our paying customers enough to cover our
costs but not so much that we'll drive them away.They'll also help us determine
how much to pay our tutors so that it's a worthwhile undertaking for them while
not breaking the bank. There is always a risk that the professional firm will
be wrong. But we'll be mitigating that risk ahead of time by selecting the firm
very carefully and by watching our post-launch bottom line very closely, so
that if errors were made we'll catch them and make adjustments quickly.
Competition
All successful businesses run the ""copycat risk"".
But we pride ourselves on our creativity - that's how we came up with the idea
and the implementation plan in the first place - and we intend to stay ahead of
the competition by continually exercising our creativity and not resting on our
laurels. You'll be amazed at some of the tricks that we have up our sleeve for
the future! And of course we'll have ""first mover advantage"" in our
favor as well.
Other Ways You Can Help
We hope that you're impressed enough by our project to
contribute to the maximum extent that you're able. And we'd like you to help by
telling your friends about us as well. Please help us get out the word about
this important project! Use email, use the Indiegogo share tools, use mail and
pony express!
And if you can't contribute financially, that's ok - but we
would still appreciate your assistance in spreading the word!




Thank you, thank you, thank you - and we hope to be able to
meet as many as our contributors as possible over time so we can thank you all
personally, too!



=========================
Frequently Asked Questions

General Service
1. 
Will this be a
simple “cheat” for students to avoid having to work on their homework
themselves?
No, not at all! Tutors will be trained to guide
students toward understanding the material and arriving at correct answers themselves
– just like good parents help their kids!
2. 
Can students select
which tutors they want to direct their questions to?
In the initial release of the service students
will be assigned the first available tutor from our highly qualified pool who
is approved for the student’s grade level and subject. Tutors are identified by
unique “handles” but are otherwise anonymous. Future releases of the service
will allow students to specify by “handle” either a “preference” for a
particular tutor (if that tutor is online he or she will be given an exclusive
window in which to respond after which the question will be assigned to the
general tutor pool) or a “requirement” for a particular tutor (if that tutor is
offline or does not respond to the question within the exclusive window the
question will be withdrawn and not be assigned to the general tutor pool).
3. 
How will students be
protected against improper tutor contacts?
Prospective tutors will undergo extensive
background checks by a reputable nationwide agency specializing in employment
background checking and only tutors will clean records will be hired. Tutors
will be instructed that all contacts with students must be maintained at the
highest professional level and must not deviate into personal conversation and
will be informed that indiscretions will result in immediate dismissal. All
tutor-student interactions will be recorded and securely preserved and will be
monitored by software in real-time to detect and flag potentially troublesome
interactions. When these are detected a Tutor Toot staff member will review the
interaction and terminate it immediately if it is problematic, following up
with appropriate action aimed at the tutor and/or student.
4. 
What grade levels
and subjects will be covered by the service?
The initial release of the service will cover all
subjects commonly taught in grades 6-12 in the USA. Future releases will also
cover standard college prep and select college level courses.
5. 
Will you support
scheduled, longer-duration tutoring sessions as well as the “toot” concept?
The initial release of the service will focus on
responding to ad hoc questions that typically arise when a student is doing
homework, studying or reviewing school work at home. Future releases of the
service will support scheduled longer-term learning sessions with student’s
choice of tutor.
6. 
What are the payment
models for paying students?
Students will be able to pay per question
(includes as much dialogue as necessary to resolve the question) or purchase a
monthly subscription that will entitle them to an as-yet-to-be-determined (but
substantial) amount of questions.
7. 
What will the fees
be for paying students?
The fee structure has not yet been determined but
the goal is to make the service as affordable as possible for the paying
students – if a student needs help we don’t want them to have to think twice
before utilizing our service.
8. 
Will you offer
peer-to-peer (student to student) communication capability?
We are very interested in building a large opt-in
community of both students and tutors who can dialogue outside the context of a
formal “toot” or tutoring session and we plan to do so, once we work out an
ironclad system to prevent abuse of the system and to protect our student and
tutor members. This functionality will not be available in the initial release
of the service.
9. 
Will transcripts of
tutoring dialogues be made available to outside parties?
All transcripts will be kept in strictest
confidence in a secure offline facility and will be revealed to outside third parties
only under legal compulsion. We are working on a permission-based set of rules
that may allow for selective sharing of transcripts with parents, teachers and
other parties with a legitimate interest in a student’s learning progress but
this will not be available in the initial release of the service. We stress
that no transcript will be released without student and parent explicit
consent.
10. 
What kinds of data
will you be gathering about students and tutors?
Will we be monitoring tutor ratings with an eye to
improving tutor effectiveness. We will also monitor the kinds of questions we
are getting from students on an overall, regional and seasonal basis in order
to better prepare our tutors for the kinds of questions they should be
expecting, again, in order to improve tutor effectiveness. All data collected
will be anonymized and under no circumstances will the questions of a
particular student be shared with third parties.
11. 
What determines
which tutor will answer a student question?
The tutor assignment algorithm is as follows: the
question is broadcast only to tutors who are online and have been certified in
the grade and subject area of the question. For paying students, preference is
given to tutors who most actively respond to qualifying free students, and the
more active a tutor is in responding to those questions, the greater the
preference that tutor receives. “Preference” means that those tutors have a
brief window during which only they can “take” a question. However the primary
objective is to get a response to the student as soon as possible so the window
of exclusivity is small, and when it expires the question is broadcast to the
entire tutor base (that is, all online tutors who are certified in the
appropriate grade and subject area).
For non-paying students the question is
immediately broadcast to the entire qualifying tutor base and no preference is
given.
Once a tutor “takes” a question other tutors are
locked out of taking it but if the “taking” tutor does not respond to the
question within a very narrow response window, the question is returned to the
tutor pool and other qualifying tutors may “take” it.
12. 
What are the hours
of operation?
Tutor Toot is intended to be an around-the-clock
operation and we will have qualified tutors in all time zones to assure maximum
coverage. Of course it is possible that at odd hours few qualified tutors will
be available but we expect that to be a very rare occurrence, especially as the
service and our tutor pool grow.
13. 
How many questions
are allowed on a “follow up” to an original question?
We do not intend to impose any limitation on
follow-up questions. However tutors will have the discretion to terminate
“toot” sessions when they determine that as much assistance as is educationally
sound has already been provided and that further interaction will be
non-productive.
14. 
What role will
parents, teachers, counselors, social workers and other parties interested in a
student’s learning progress play in the Tutor Toot platform?
We are working on a permission-based set of rules
that may allow for selective sharing of transcripts with parents, teachers and
other parties with a legitimate interest in a student’s learning progress but
this will not be available in the initial release of the service. We stress
that no transcript will be released without student and parent explicit
consent. For paying students, where parental consent is required for online
purchases, it will be obtained.

Free Service
15. 
How will you qualify
students for the free service?
We will be working with local non-profits with a
focus on education on a grass-roots level to identify qualified students. We
will also be working, as appropriate, with local governments, schools and
social service agencies to identify such students. Prior to our launch we will
aggressively reach out to these organizations using traditional, electronic and
social media to assure that they are aware of our service and know how to refer
qualifying students to us.
16. 
How will the free
service be funded?
Our business model will enable us to allocate a
portion of our profits from our paying service toward provision of the free
service to qualifying students. To further broaden our reach we will also work
to obtain funding from government agencies and private philanthropic
organizations.
17. 
How long will
qualified students be able to use the service for free?
We will not impose arbitrary limitations on how
long our service can be used by qualified students who are funded by Tutor Toot.
We will re-evaluate student qualification for the free service on an annual
basis and as long as a student meets the qualifications and is in a grade level
serviced by Tutor Toot they will be able to utilize the service. 
Students funded by outside organizations will be
serviced as long as the funding for them continues. If it terminates and
students formerly covered by them still require the service they will be given
priority for internally funded free slots.

Tutors
18. 
What qualifications
will be required of tutors?
Tutors will need to demonstrate proficiency in the
subjects and grade levels for which they wish to qualify. They will need to
show that they have received training in those areas at a credentialed
institute of higher learning, and/or prior experience teaching or tutoring in
those areas. References will be sought and selectively verified. Tutors will
also have to pass a Tutor Toot administered test before qualifying at a Tutor
Toot tutor.
Prospective tutors will undergo extensive
background checks by a reputable nationwide agency specializing in employment
background checking and only tutors with clean records will be hired.
19. 
How will tutors be
screened before being hired?
Prospective tutors will undergo extensive
background checks by a reputable nationwide agency specializing in employment
background checking and only tutors will clean records will be hired.
20. 
How will the tutor
ratings be used?
Tutor ratings are intended as a tool to enable
tutors to improve their performance and as a tool for Tutor Toot to assure that
it is utilizing the services of only the best tutors. Periodically students who
rate tutors will be sent optional surveys where they will be given the
opportunity to elaborate on their tutor ratings and the results of these
surveys, in anonymized form, will be shared with the tutors.
21. 
What tools will you
provide your tutors in order to streamline their question response process?
We will watching “question trends” on an overall,
regional and seasonal basis and keep our tutors regularly informed as to what
kinds of questions they should be expecting. In our initial release tutors will
be able to build private libraries of common responses to frequently asked
questions and will be able to utilize those “canned” answers as their initial
response to student’s questions. (Of course the actual dialogue with the
student after the initial response will be personalized and not reliant on
canned information.)
In a future service release global libraries of
responses to frequently asked questions will be developed and will be available
to all tutors, in addition to their private libraries of responses.
22. 
How much will the
tutors be paid?
For paying students the tutors will be paid a
percentage of the fee paid by the student (in the pay-as-you-go fee model) and
a prorated percentage of the monthly fee based on the number of questions
actually asked during that month. The payment model for tutors is currently
being refined and will be finalized prior to the launch of the service. 
23. 
How will the tutors
be paid?
Funds will accumulate in a tutor’s online Tutor

Each school has two teachers, usually one Hindu and one Muslim. The musical forms are: bhabaya/polygit, murshidi, baul, and Lalan git (songs by the famous poet Lalan Fakir). The traditional instruments are: ektara (from ek “one” and tar “string”), dotara (literally, two strings, but in practice often more), khamak, sarinda (a fiddle-like instrument), and dhol (drums). Each school has its own set of basic instruments, including a harmonium and tabladrums for the teaching of scales/modes and rhythm. So far, 17 village schools have been set up, most of them with 20 to 25 pupils, who attend for at least two afternoons a week. In many cases they attend every day.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Organize large or small meals, or festivals. This is being organized every year. One year we gathered all of the musical elders. On that occasion, during a time of<br/>Emergency Rule, 150 singers and musicians – Hindus and Muslims, men and women – came from all corners of the large districts in order to sing in the town of<br/>Lalmonirhat.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Archive the traditional music and songs, write down the songs of the oldest singers, and ensure that the children learn these while master teachers are still available.</span></p>
<p>d) Run the Arshi Nagar Sound Studio, which we have built and equipped in the<br/>town of Lalmonirhat. There is no other sound studio in Northern Bangladesh. In<br/>this studio, CDs have been produced. These may generate some little income for<br/>some of the musicians, but above all the CDs provide the pleasure of giving<br/>something to their country (and their language!), and of seeing that traditions<br/>which were about to disappear will survive after all.<br/></p>
<p><span>The SUNO Project has been run with donations from Norway, which are used entirely to pay the Bangladeshis who work on the project, to buy instruments, and to give aid in the case of medical or other crises.<span>  </span></span><br/> </p>

The organization which runs this project in Bangladesh is called Arshi Nagar and is being supported by our organization SUNO in Norway. The project area is the two districts of Lalmonirhat and Kurigram, including moving sand islands in the Brahmaputra River. Music is one of few artistic expressions that lightens a daily life of hardship in this flood-prone area. 
Now we need your help to ensure the continuation of one of these project activities:
Due to political reasons in Norway, we are losing some of our financial support in 2015 which will harm the musical instrument training component. With the potential amount we will receive through crowd funding, we will be able to continue the training in all the different music schools, the gurugrihos. We will also have the opportunity to repair and upgrade the instruments which are being used for teaching. This is at the same time maintenance of valuable traditional instruments.
The project’s main components are as follows:
a) Establish and run village music “schools” where children aged seven to sixteen – boys and girls, Muslims and Hindus – learn to sing and play traditional music that was about to disappear. Each school has two teachers, usually one Hindu and one Muslim. The musical forms are: bhabaya/polygit, murshidi, baul, and Lalan git (songs by the famous poet Lalan Fakir).

<p><b>How Your Contribution Impacts Teens from Placer and Nevada Counties<br/></b>Since our last Indiegogo campaign, we have been meeting with many community partners who have confirmed the need for a non-profit to help teens transition into being successful adults in our area.  We have interested schools, church groups, and other community partners who have youth who would benefit from our program and are looking for summer programs. We need the additional funds to cover the seminar materials, insurance, and marketing of our program - so we can open our office doors early this summer. With your contribution, we can make the transition from start-up to delivering our first program and building our momentum for future programs and consistent funding as an established non-profit.

How Your Contribution Impacts Teens from Placer and Nevada CountiesSince our last Indiegogo campaign, we have been meeting with many community partners who have confirmed the need for a non-profit to help teens transition into being successful adults in our area.  We have interested schools, church groups, and other community partners who have youth who would benefit from our program and are looking for summer programs. We need the additional funds to cover the seminar materials, insurance, and marketing of our program - so we can open our office doors early this summer. With your contribution, we can make the transition from start-up to delivering our first program and building our momentum for future programs and consistent funding as an established non-profit. Our community partners include:

        
Tahoe Truckee Collaborative ~  Youth Empowerment Support ~ Placer Collaborative Network ~ Placer County Health & Human Services ~ Nevada County Health & Human Services ~ Parkside Community Church ~ Chana High School ~ Kids First ~ Pride Industries ~ Courageous Connection/Evolve You Foundation ~ Placer Coalition of Youth ~ Tahoe Truckee Foundation ~ Placer Community Foundation ~ Community Support Network of Nevada County ~ Center for Nonprofit Leaders ~ Nonprofit Resource Center ~ Placer County Sheriffs ~ Nevada County Sheriffs ~ Grass Valley Police Department ~ Rocklin Police Department ~ City of Roseville Police Department ~ Boys & Girls Clubs ~ Campaign for Community Wellness ~ News, Events & Opportunities - NEO ~ Placer County Office of Education.
Challenges
The biggest hurdle we face this year is obtaining funds from corporate giving programs or foundations because we are a new non-profit.  Our charge this year is to: build our community support, deliver three summer programs and eight fall programs, and boost our marketing and visibility in the community.  Your contributions allow us to achieve this goal. 
Other Ways You Can HelpIf you are unable to make a contribution to our campaign, you can still be one of our community of supporters!  


Please share this campaign with your friends and family. 
Be sure to use the Indiegogo share tools - you can share it on Facebook with your friends and family.
Sign up to receive our newsletter so you can see our progress!  We would love to ""keep you in the loop"" so you can continue to be one of our supporters! 
We need office equipment and supplies. If you have some donations, let us know and we'll let you know what we need!
Please let us know if your company has a matching donation program.

<p>Project Video: A small clip from last years Runway 7.0 show, themed 
Chrysalis, with collection by senior designer, and friend, Meghan 
McNicholl. Each show includes individual student designers and concludes
 with the senior projects, one of them shown here. <br/></p>
<p>Hello! I am a SUNY Buffalo College student studying apparel design. My last year here, I must showcase my final collection in the annual runway, held at my college. The final 
project/runway, requires each student to go through a process similar to
 preparations for a real fashion show. For an academic year, I research 
trends and, in collaboration with the ultimate theme for runway (this 
year is innovation), I design a trend, color, fabric, pattern, and line 
board with 6 outfits. The next steps are recruiting models, making 
patterns, drafts, then completed garments. There are many other smaller 
steps in the process, but the main goal is to get my 6 garments on the 
runway.</p>
<p>My collection is inspired by recent trends involving lace 
intimates evolved into evening/formal wear, such as indie brand, For 
Love and Lemons. My collection targets the ability to transform 
intimates one usually wears around the house into elegant, but 
comfortable outfits for all outings. The innovation aspect lies in the 
ability to allow women to be comfortable at all times and still look 
elegant; to transform the 'rolled out of bed' look into something 
desirable. </p>
<p>As a college student, I need help funding my project, 
as it requires much material and supplies. If any funds come my way, I'll put it towards purchasing yards of fabric, lace, zippers, lining, and other sewing essentials and supplies, shoes, accessories, and hair and makeup products for my models. Challenges that might occur after my project has been funded, is that I might waste the money on accidentally purchasing the wrong fabric. To overcome this, I've decided to purchase swatches of the fabric, first, before I commit to bulk. Also, to make the most of the money funded, so that I don't waste/run out, I will purchase fabric and supplies at the most reasonable price I can find. When I'm completed with my collection, and it walks down the runway at the end of the year, I will be able to put this collection towards my college portfolio, which will help me build my resume for future careers/internships! I'm very excited to start 
this project and hope it peaks some interest in fellow GOGOs who
 love fashion as much as I do. I'd be thankful for even the smallest 
contribution! It would help, a lot, even to share my campaign with others! And, please, if you're in the Buffalo, NY area, you're 
welcome to attend this fashion show, on April 25th. More information can
 be found on the college website, here: runway.buffalostate.edu. <br/></p>

<p>Growing Minds Center is a small school dedicated to bettering the lives of children with Autism and other disabilities, with a focus on helping the kids to be able to live in mainstream society. Located in the small town of Port Saint Joe, Florida, we are the only school that specializes in Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) in the Tri-County area. Seeing these kiddos grow, learn, and thrive in a way that they never have before is extremely rewarding and makes a job that might seem difficult endlessly worthwhile. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Our staff is like a family and the kids are the heart of it.</span></p>
<p>This indiegogo campaign and the money we hope to raise from it will help us in a number of ways.

<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b>What is Applied Behavior Analysis?</b></h3>
<p></p>

&lt;3 Growing Minds Center
<ul> </ul> </div> <p><br/></p></div>","What is Growing Minds Center? 
Growing Minds Center is a small school dedicated to bettering the lives of children with Autism and other disabilities, with a focus on helping the kids to be able to live in mainstream society. Located in the small town of Port Saint Joe, Florida, we are the only school that specializes in Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) in the Tri-County area. Seeing these kiddos grow, learn, and thrive in a way that they never have before is extremely rewarding and makes a job that might seem difficult endlessly worthwhile. Our staff is like a family and the kids are the heart of it.
This indiegogo campaign and the money we hope to raise from it will help us in a number of ways. From providing our school with basic, yet necessary supplies to saving for a new building with more space.. every little bit that we raise will go towards the education of these very special kids.

What is Applied Behavior Analysis?

Behavior analysis is a practice that focuses on the principles that explain how learning takes place. The point of Applied Behavioral Analysis is to provide techniques for more useful behaviors and less harmful ones. Positive reinforcement is an example - when a behavior is followed by a reward, the behavior is more likely to happen again. Applied behavior analysis uses these techniques to aid in a meaningful and positive change in behavior.    What We Need & What You Get

Our set goal will be used for school materials, small field trips, therapy tools, and reinforcers for the kids. Any extra we make will go towards saving for our ""Someday"" Wish List.
Our ""Someday"" Wish List: A larger school facility, a transportation van, playground equipment, therapeutic play equipment, field trip funds, a touchscreen computer, iPads, and more staff members!
As a perk to donating to our cause, we have handcrafted gifts by our students including autism hair bows, Christmas ornaments, a penguin family winter decoration, a pack of Christmas cards, and a thank you video with a Christmas carol!    The Impact

<p>RTKids is an arts education
organization dedicated to enriching the lives of children through the
arts.  RTKids was founded in 2003 by Rosie O’Donnell as a way to transform
the lives of underprivileged children through arts education.  RTKids is
based in New York City and serves thousands of children in the New York area
every year through in-school programs and programs at the Maravel Arts Center.</p>
<p>Students involved in the programs not only gain training
in the arts; they also gain confidence, pride, discipline, and a sense of
personal accomplishment.  RTKids teaches children how to strive for
excellence and achieve their goals.  That’s why their motto is “Rosie’s
Theater Kids- We’re Rehearsing for Life”.  These programs have proven
successful at improving academic results, and RTKids has achieved a 100% high
school graduation rate for all students participating in programs at the
Maravel Arts Center.</p>

<h3>The Atlanta Project</h3>
<div>
</div>
<p>I am facilitating a one-week
residency of RTKids in Atlanta.  We will be working with the entire 5th grade class of two underserved Atlanta elementary schools
February 18-21.  The Atlanta project will consist of an abbreviated
version of the current PS Broadway program, the in-school program in the New
York area. </p>
<p><b>UPDATE:</b> Toomer Elementary School in East Lake and Briar Vista Elementary near Emory will be the two schools participating in the project.</p>
<p>Each individual 5th grade class will
have one 45-minute lesson in dance, music and performance Wednesday-Friday,
Feb. 18-20 taught by Thecla Harris, the Artistic Director of PS Broadway in New
York, and accompanied by a RTKids pianist.  On Saturday, Feb. 21, there
will be a final performance at SCADShow (formerly 14th Street Playhouse) for family, friends, and
community members, where the kids will display the skills they’ve
learned. </p>
<p>As part of this program, schools also receive theater
tickets to take the entire 5th grade on a field trip to see an age-appropriate
show the Alliance Theater, as well as funds to help cover the cost of bus
transportation.  </p>
<h3>Your Contribution</h3>
<div></div>
<p><b>UPDATE:</b> We need $2,700 to make the RTKids Atlanta Project a
reality.  The project has recently received some generous outside donations and $6,000 is our stretch goal to provide additional RTKids services to underserved children.  We have already raised enough money to get RTKids down to
Atlanta for the residency, but now we need your help to provide the children with
the full experience.</p>
<p>With your help, we will be able to
secure a venue for the final performance, purchase theater tickets for the
children, and transportation for their field trip to the show. </p>
<p><b>Your contribution to this campaign is
100% tax deductible and goes directly towards supporting the arts education of
Atlanta students.</b></p>
<p>As an added bonus, The Lovett
Foundation has agreed to match up to the first $2,500 raised in this campaign.</p>
<p>The money you donate will help bring this proven program
to Atlanta kids, and start delivering the kind of results experienced with
the New York Rosie’s Theater Kids program. I hope you’ll join us in discovering
the joy of changing kids’ lives with your donation.</p>

</div>","This summer four friends
will be driving across North America with a mission: to see a little bit of the
world and make it just a little bit better. Us four adventurers, Morgan
Campbell, Dylan Evans, Harrison Tanner, and Alex Tomaszewski will be buying a yellow 48 passenger
school bus and turning it into an RV. We'll fire up that bad boy and leave
Toronto heading west across Canada, south down the coast, east through the
southern United States, and finally back home, going with the road and stopping
where we will. 
In each major city we stop
in along the way we'll spend a day volunteering our time at an array of
organizations. These will include food banks, tree planting,
habitat-for-humanity, and other community based outreach programs. Through
these experiences our hope is to bring positivity to the communities we visit
and do some good on the road. Our overarching hope is to inspire others to
follow in our footsteps and travel with a purpose.
Alex, our newest Northern Lights member, very recently decided to join the team. Throughout the trip he will be collecting footage of our
experiences and conducting interviews of team members, organization leaders, and individuals we meet along the way. With that footage we will be creating a documentary that will focus on the concept of voluntourism and giving back to the communities one visits. This documentary will allow us to share our message on a broad scale.  We will be able to spread our message, travel with a purpose, to communities far and wide.
The donations we receive will be used to purchase the school bus, renovate and adapt it, fill her up with fuel to keep her moving, and ultimately get us from one volunteer organization to the next. With your support we can make this dream a reality!Listed below is the route we will be taking and the

<h3>Our Story</h3> <p></p>
<p>Three years ago, coaches John Devlin, John Commins and Colin Throness decided they had enough talent between Perspectives I and II to enter a team into the Greater Montreal Athletics Association’s Division 1. It was a long season and the team only managed one victory. The next year, with the addition of Options II coach Paul Berry, the coaches approached the GMAA about letting other alternative schools (of which there are ten in total) provide the team with players. The proposal was accepted and thus the Alternative United Pit Bulls were born. </p>
<p>They entered GMAA’s Division 1 again, sourcing players from five different schools. This very talented group of ballers immediately made a name for themselves as a tough, passionate and scrappy team. They posted 7 wins and 4 losses and made the playoffs in dramatic fashion, but lost narrowly in the quarter finals.</p>
<p>That summer Gatorade found an article about Alternative United in the Montreal Gazette. They contacted the coaches and asked to make a promotional video about the team as part of their online series, Win From Within. Gatorade shot the video in early October, at the outset of the season, and released it in January to huge accolades. It quickly went viral and the media coverage around the team blew up: CBC, Global, Sportsnet Central, Breakfast Television and the Gazette all did stories on the Pit Bulls fantastic and growing success.</p>
<p>As a thanks for making the video, Gatorade sent the whole team by train to Toronto to take in a Raptors game in a luxury suite. The players were spoiled with a two-course meal at Real Sports Bar &amp; Grill and were greeted in their luxury box with great Raptors swag, t-shirts and hats, and pizzas and snacks, as well as some of the best seats in the house. The Raptors must have been inspired by the Pit Bulls presence, because in Alternative United fashion they mounted a late comeback and won the game in the dying seconds.</p>
<p>Fuelled by all the excitement, the Pit Bulls won their last game of the season in the dying seconds to tie for a playoff spot. Sadly they lost the tiebreaker against Greaves in a scrappy and exciting tilt. But the season had already been deemed a success – Alternative United was now an internationally celebrated high school franchise.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Fundraising Campaign</span></h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>There are two reasons we’re raising money. Firstly, we’re looking for a basketball court to call home. The schools all have gyms, but none of them are adequate to host games. We do have practices, but the gym we use is only big enough to play 4-on-4. We’ve got our future home base narrowed down to two venues: either the YMCA downtown or the Little Burgundy Sports Centre. Both are great options in terms of location and environment.</p>The second reason we’re looking for funding is to provide tutoring for the players and other alternative-school students who are in need. The tutoring centre will be called the Alternative United Headquarters and it will ideally be located near to or in the same building as our home court. While there are occasionally tutors available at our schools, budgets have been cut in the past year and individual academic attention is harder to come by for our students. There are thousands of university students who are capable and willing to help as volunteers, interns and part-time staff. It’s time to get the ball rolling.<p></p>
<p>Our players and students are considered youth at risk, learning disabled, behavioural problems, delinquents – there are plenty of labels, too many to list. We want to help break these young people free from those often harmful stamps and the best way to do that is to lead by example. None of us would have read this far if we hadn’t had good people encouraging us to keep learning.</p>
<p>We’re reaching out to you, the people who know and care about the social issues that our players and students face. There is a subtle and crippling bigotry inherent in having low expectations for people. We can’t up on youth before they give up in themselves. Not only do we believe our students can succeed if they put their hearts into it, we know they will succeed. </p>
<p>If we can’t show them how to believe and know in themselves, then who will? If we can’t show them how to reach out and help someone, who will? </p>
</div> <div> <h3>Alternative United Headquarters</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>The simple equation behind the Alternative United Headquarters is to offer team members and other Outreach students free tutoring and a healthy snack after school. It’s no secret that many of the students in the Outreach system do not have enough access to one-on-one education and will not get a high school diploma without help. Private tutors don’t come cheap these days and the government has cut funding to in-school tutors, so our schools have had trouble providing the usual and necessary supply of supplementary instruction. But just because tutoring budgets were cut doesn’t mean our students don’t need tutors anymore – quite the opposite, in fact. </p>
</div><div> <p>
</p>
<p>The goal is to set up a tutoring centre that’s near our home court, if not in the same building. The YMCA and Little Burgundy Sports Centre are both viable options and discussions are underway. The Headquarters will hire both veteran tutors and junior volunteers, such as undergrad students and student teachers. This bright young team of academics, future professionals and teachers will also get involved with a homemade snack program provided to all students who attend. The tutoring centre will ideally be open four days a week, three hours a day after school.</p>

The delicate sensibility rich national character of Japan with its Hard-working
people has proven to the people of Japan and the rest of the world, that Japan has potential
in various genres to create a unique and high-quality products and culture. They're

</p><p>The first one is that, there are not enough

<p>
</p><p>And the second is, most of them do not understand
English well, so they are not able to communicate the information precisely and
effectively to the rest of the world. In particular, this second reason is very
strong reason for the people who run the projects in individuals and <span>at</span> a small scale. </p>

This lack in information transmission has become a major barrier because the human resource of the individual level small project in Japan uses to have a very less probability to be able to understand English. <br/><br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436261762/pmmm0k7ypd2pwztwxdly.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
I believe, it is misconception of 90% or more American people that they
think ‘Japanese people speak English’. Certainly Japanese people learn English
at school, but the curriculum is not at all practical, English is learned as
a subject, but not learned as professional English, the reality is that it is not
possible to speak daily life English<br/></p>
<p>
Because of this barrier wall of the language, most of the Japanese do
browse the only Japanese site and not able to access the English web page. There
are so many <span><span><span>information</span></span></span> and happening <span><span><span>of</span></span></span> English-speaking countries, which
exactly not transmitted to Japan and only the translated version of it is
<span><span><span>floated</span></span></span> in Japanese news and media. On the other hand, Japanese media <span><span><span>is</span></span></span> also
not able to transmit information to the overseas. Despite of longing and
interest in the culture and products overseas, the bottleneck problem of the Japanese
people are words of English that is why they are not able to exchange direct
information with the English-speaking countries.</p><p><b>
This is a very serious problem, not only the <span><span><span>Japanese but</span></span></span> also for the
English-speaking countries because of which, has missed a very large business
<span><span><span>opportunities</span></span></span>.</b><br/></p><p></p>
No matter how much strong liking and possession is held by Japanese
people for the commodities in English-speaking countries, they do not know
about it directly. Similarly, no matter how strong interests for Japanese products
and culture have on people of English-speaking countries is they are not able
to get information about it in the English-speaking countries. <span><br/></span><p></p><p></p><p><b><span></span></b></p><p></p><p><span><br/></span><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436181189/mxlycfhtqti6wwe7gsdp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

which is a big barrier between the two countries Japan and the English-speaking

Which means most of people in Japan cannot invest their money in good ideas, even they cannot recognize that is announced.  Most of Japanese does not understand in English. Existing Japanese crowdfunding sites are just gathering contribution inside Japanese nations only.  
The Japanese social system isn't as open and receptive as the American system is, especially regarding business and personal investments. Japanese people don't easily share with one another their financial plans. A platform that will allow this sharing is necessary to move the Japanese economy in this new direction. Japanese language FLYING HIGH is the right choice to make it happen.
Language is a major issue for Americans who want to crowdfund in Japan or Japanese who want to crowd fund in the United States. Only about 10% of Japanese speak or read English. FLYING HIGH will make a difference, offering perfect translations and better communications between investors and the people looking to raise money. A FLYING HIGH is important because it opens the doors to a greater understanding between the people who need funding and those who wish to offer it.
Japan has one of the highest GDPs in the world, making it an excellent source for seeking investors who want to participate in the global market.
As it stands now, Japanese crowdfunding sites only solicit contributions from inside Japan. FLYING HIGH site intends to open this opportunity to all Asian countries: Korea, Viet Nam, Thailand, China and others. 
There is little doubt that need for a crowdfunding site in Japan has a high potential for success; but only if it uses the language of the country; Japanese. Language matters. Our site will communicate in the way that the people of our country understand, appreciate and are most likely to respond to.However the challenge is to launch it in Japanese!!







The delicate sensibility rich national character of Japan with its Hard-working
people has proven to the people of Japan and the rest of the world, that Japan has potential
in various genres to create a unique and high-quality products and culture. They're
uncountable examples such as 
Sony, Toyota, Hitachi etc. are representative for industrial products,

Dragon Ball, AKIRA is representative of animation, comics culture


Pokemon, nevertheless in bio-hazard and revolutionary game culture

Hayao Miyazaki represents the high end potential· In Japan at one hand, there is the development  of  a highly original game software
Japan Girls fashion referred to is originality has been rated as KAWAII
Temple of the Golden Pavilion, Japanese sword, kimono, Makie, such as Ukiyo-e, traditional culture there are a lot of fans in the West
Such, is not only the famous ones have been recognized worldwide. Still in Japan, talent that is not known to the world, technology, there are many products.But, unfortunately, they do not have a chance to inform its presence abroad.The reason is that there are two.
The first one is that, there are not enough
funds to the people who promote this idea as they do not have the source of
funding. This is also the case of the owner of this webpage like other people who
carry out the campaign. 

And the second is, most of them do not understand
English well, so they are not able to communicate the information precisely and
effectively to the rest of the world. In particular, this second reason is very
strong reason for the people who run the projects in individuals and at a small scale. 

This lack in information transmission has become a major barrier because the human resource of the individual level small project in Japan uses to have a very less probability to be able to understand English. 

I believe, it is misconception of 90% or more American people that they
think ‘Japanese people speak English’. Certainly Japanese people learn English
at school, but the curriculum is not at all practical, English is learned as
a subject, but not learned as professional English, the reality is that it is not
possible to speak daily life English

Because of this barrier wall of the language, most of the Japanese do
browse the only Japanese site and not able to access the English web page. There
are so many information and happening of English-speaking countries, which
exactly not transmitted to Japan and only the translated version of it is
floated in Japanese news and media. On the other hand, Japanese media is also
not able to transmit information to the overseas. Despite of longing and
interest in the culture and products overseas, the bottleneck problem of the Japanese
people are words of English that is why they are not able to exchange direct
information with the English-speaking countries.
This is a very serious problem, not only the Japanese but also for the
English-speaking countries because of which, has missed a very large business
opportunities.
No matter how much strong liking and possession is held by Japanese
people for the commodities in English-speaking countries, they do not know
about it directly. Similarly, no matter how strong interests for Japanese products
and culture have on people of English-speaking countries is they are not able
to get information about it in the English-speaking countries. 
By getting rid of the language barrier, between Japan and the English-speaking
countries, the words are no more a boundary in the true sense. If the words are
the problems we as FLYING HIGH team are here to solve it and to provide Japan
and the English-speaking countries an environment in which both culture and
technology can send to borderless. This will make it feasible to send the ideas,
culture, technology and products that are buried in Japan, at the same time and
by calling the English-speaking countries the ideas, culture, technology and
products in Japan, big chance to both culture and business that it will spread.
If there is a wall, we can remove it if we FLYING HIGH. We will be the
first crowd-funding site that connects the world's Japan and English-speaking
countries to promote the cultural and business exchanges. 
FLYING HIGH will help you to brand yourself if you are a talented artist,
venture companies, ties to powerful and traditional crafts and food of the sum.
FLYING HIGH will introduce your goods to Japanese distributors and consumers. ‘The
buried ideas’ are one of the main effects to be eliminated and it is caused by language,
which is a big barrier between the two countries Japan and the English-speaking
countries. It is the idea, which contributes to the culture, industry and so
the development of the country and the idea may be originated outside the boundary
of the country. This is the vision set forth us FLYING HIGH.
So, please experience the wonderful world by
eliminating the language barriers, using our system By all means.We also Translate Japanese campaigns into English, then we put those campaigns to IndieGOGO or Kickstarter.

In a nutshell, you can run out of the presence or absence of the channel to the language-speaking non-Japanese. Crowdfunding site that currently exists in Japan, have been intended only for those who can read and write Japanese. Japan resident of creators, launched a campaign towards the Japanese, in most cases the investor to invest living in Japan, is rarely there to be an intervention, capital and ideas overseas.In the same way, in language-speaking crowdfunding site of a non-Japanese, the site does not exist that support to the Japanese.If FLYING HIGH is standing up, will this situation will change greatly. For the English-speaking countries of the product and creators of works, it will be possible to receive assistance from the Japanese investor. Conversely, for Japanese products and creators of the work, it is also possible to receive assistance from English-speaking countries of the investors.FLYING HIGH will operate the crowdfunding site only in Japanese. When English-speaking countries of the creators and venture companies to find product development and investor towards Japan, we help the translation into Japanese, we can make the campaign in FLYING HIGH.Japanese creators and venture companies, when the looking product development and investors towards the English-speaking countries, you can now take advantage of the well-known crowdfunding site, including the visit of the site.FLYING HIGH of the name, or the campaign page of FLYING HIGH exhibitor bearing the logo we created in English.Exhibitor and investors gathered in Japan, has already started. If safely of funds gathered project ready earnest operation, we will be the number to see the works of Japanese creators found in now visit the site. In the same way, if there is an offer for the project from the English-speaking countries of the creators and venture companies, it is possible to find a suitable investor in Japan.From English-speaking countries of the creators and venture companies, advertising how to gather project seekers towards FLYING HIGH it has not yet been established. Fund gathered project will be activities with a view to partnership with the crowdfunding site of the English-speaking if earnest operation.Also, since this project is not in All or Nothing type, the project will be carried out on the basis of the funds we receive also invested as did not reach the desired amount. If you have finished in the amount close to the desired amount, but probably will be carried out the project close to the plan as pace, if you do not receive significantly to hope amount, progress pace for the plan might produce a delay.
The above image is for testing use only, we borrow the images in this image.・If this project is successful, what will change us?Change things there are two.1. The product of Japanese creators and venture companies, it is possible to to know in it for the unchanged speed living in Japan, you can buy them or support. New talent and work and did not know until now, so that you can feel the product familiar.2. The product of English-speaking countries of the creators and venture companies to inform the Japanese that the Japanese can not only understand, you can receive a purchase or support. To spread excellent talent and works of their own, a product in Japan, it opens up opportunities to expand market share in Asia.・Crowdfunding site in English-speaking, do you plan to use where?For now, it is scheduled for Indiegogo and Kickstarter, depending on the nature of the works and products, there is also the possibility of using another crowdfunding site best suited to notice it.・Do not plan to make the English version of FLYING HIGH towards the English-speaking countries?Although there is a possibility in the future, and system construction to perform the Japanese and the simultaneous management of English, vast and do advertising of the site in English-speaking huge additional budget because necessary, already enough at this stage We have determined the most reasonable to operate with the help of existing sites such as Indiegogo and Kickstarter, which has been recognized.・I do not speak Japanese, we are able to launch a campaign towards the Japanese?Of course you can. Japanese of the text, Japanese subtitles and dubbing of videos is possible that we behalf.・And the amount of investment, please tell me about each of Parks.1.
