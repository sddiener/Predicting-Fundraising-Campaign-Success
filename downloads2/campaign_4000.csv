<p class=""normal"">Chicago Dyke March Collective is a grassroots mobilization and celebration of dyke, queer, bisexual, and transgender resilience. It is an anti-racist, anti-violent, volunteer-led, grassroots effort with a goal to bridge together communities across race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, age, size, gender identity, gender expression, sexuality, culture, immigrant status, spirituality, and ability.</p>
<p class=""normal""> </p>
<p class=""normal""><strong><em>Where you come in:</em></strong></p>
<p class=""normal"">Chicago Dyke March is an event that celebrates queers, dykes, and trans and dykes all across the spectrum. The Chicago Dyke March mobilizes all of us who live, love, struggle for justice, and express ourselves in ways that aren’t necessarily recognized or supported by mainstream society. Every year, we work hard to assure that not only the march is a success, but that we continue to build on the successes (and mistakes) of those before us to make the event even more successful, community led, and offers a place of celebration and visibility for all that attend.</p>
<p class=""normal""> </p>
<p class=""normal"">As a march and as a movement, CDM brings folks together, and builds relationships - across movements, communities, neighborhoods, identities, gender presentations, abilities, and immigration statuses. For us, it’s about doing community, and movement-building work within and among queer communities all within the capacity of a completely volunteer led collective.</p>
<p class=""normal"">We’re intentional about fundraising and reach out to organizations we consider as anti-oppressive and aligning with our principles and values.</p>
<p class=""normal""> </p>
<p class=""normal""><strong>On June 29, 2013- Chicago Dyke March</strong> will take place in the neighborhood of Argyle with an ending rally in Margate Park. <strong>In preparation for this fabulous and fierce event we are trying our hardest to raise enough money to pay for permits -- which have gone up every year and have become more difficult to navigate --  a stage, vendors, and other city costs. </strong></p>
<p class=""normal"">Every year we hear about how Chicago Dyke March changes so many lives, how this is the only time all year they feel like they are part of a supportive community, and gives them strength that lasts the entire year. Can you help us make sure it happens this year?</p>
<p class=""normal""><strong>$4000 is the bare minimum of what we need for this year and to start planning for next year. If we all pull together we can raise more to make sure all Dyke March costs are covered as well as pay our amazing performers/DJ's at our other fundraising events and day of the march</strong>. </p>
<p class=""normal"">Our community is <strong>BIG</strong> - Chicago Dyke March touches thousands of people! If everyone can contribute a small amount, we can continue to make sure that this celebration of our community’s resilience keeps happening. </p>
<p class=""normal"">We also take in kind donations, raffle prizes, and have a list items that also are key to making the march a success, for more information about this email us at dykemarchchicago@gmail.com.</p>

<em>THE HE<strong>ART</strong> OF THE MATTER</em>: </h3>
<p>• Found a perfect space for a studio/gallery for myself and to share with the community: ""<strong>ART SPACE malibu</strong>.""</p>
<p>• I am having a ""sale"" (see ""perks"") through Indiegogo to help get it up and running.</p>
<p>• <strong>ART SPACE malibu</strong> will hold art sessions for local artists, and host evening events for the Malibu community, introducing art, music and more.</p>

<h3>
<em>THE DETAILS: </em>    </h3>
<p>I have been dreaming of a space like this since I was a kid!  Recently my dream was reinvisioned when my kids both started school full time and I decided to move forward with my art.   I have decided to use this awesome Indiegogo platform to have a ""sale"" and donate 100% of proceeds to this exciting endeavor.</p>
<h3>
<em>MY GOAL:</em> </h3>
<p><strong>ART SPACE malibu</strong> will be more than a studio for me but an art space for the community, bursting with adult art sessions, community events that introduce new artists to the Malibu community and any other events that may evolve from <strong>ART SPACE malibu</strong>. My personal goal is to paint at least 10 paintings to create 2  ""collections"" within this first year and come up with a few more jewelry designs...you can own some of my work just by supporting.  Jewelry, prints, paintings and judaica  are available - check it all out!!</p>
<p>      My financial goal is to raise enough money for <strong>ART SPACE malibu</strong> to get a running start and generate funds to cover the first few events and basic supplies.  I set my goal low, knowing <strong>I have to cover the rent first and foremost - all money raised above $7500 will go towards supplies and maintaining the studio (i.e. office supplies, model fees, drawing horses, art supplies, and events costs).</strong>  I believe that with the support of my friends, family, clients, new supporters and the community, this can be a lasting staple in Malibu.  I hope the community will look forward to monthly events and locals artists can come sketch and draw with me.  Professional instruction will also be made available when the demand rises.  I set my goal low at $7,500 but hope to raise up to $20,000 as that will be the true operating costs for the first year.  I know that it will all work out one way or another and thank everyone for any and all support : )</p>
<p>       So...See what is for ""sale"" and think about what you may like for friends, family, upcoming gifts or for yourself, know that every penny will be going to <strong>ART SPACE malibu</strong> and to help a dream come true!</p>

<h2 class=""big_type"">Bath bombs and shower fizzies designed after the iconic images that we all know and love!</h2>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span dir=""ltr"" id="":2qq"">I love baths, and I love awesome baths. I noticed, though, that there is a gap in the bath product world for awesome, geeky items that people who love video games and comics would really enjoy. So, I decided to design my own line of bath bombs and shower fizzies for those who felt the same way! That's why I made my company- Fizzy Fairy Apothecary! The video above only talks about the Pokeball Bath Bombs, which I wanted to start with because they are so iconic.  I have decided to extend the line to My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic inspired pokeballs as well!</span></p>
<p>The Pokeball inspired bath bombs will not only look like Pokeballs, but each and every one of them will have a Pokemon toy inside that will reveal itself once you fizz the bath bomb in your tub! These are a little more expensive than the Pony bath bombs for that reason. The shower fizzies will not have these toys, since they are too small to hold them inside. <strong>NOTE</strong>: the original Pokeball bath bombs do turn your water red, as do any with red in them, so keep that in mind if you find the idea of bathing in red water creepy! These bath bombs/shower fizzies also contain oils, so please message me if you are allergic to sweet almond oil so I can make sure yours are made with grapeseed oils.</p>
<p>The cost of making so many of these is too large for me to take on myself- these costs include not only the materials for the bath bombs, which can add up quickly with large amounts of fragrance oils, but also for packaging material, business cards and labels, and molds for the bombs themselves. </p>

<p><strong>Oatmeal Milk and Honey-</strong> Raw oats, almond, soy milk and a kiss of honey.</p>

<p><strong>White Tea and Ginger-</strong>  White tea, lemon, yuzu, clean florals and spicy ginger in a harmonius blend.</p>
<p><strong>Lavender Relaxation-</strong> A calming and relaxing blend of fresh lavender softened beautifully with a gentle white musk and a gentle kiss of soft powder notes as a background.<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Wedding Day-</strong> Romance abounds with top notes of apricot and pear, middle notes of orchid and bird of paradise and rounded out with sandalwood, musk and English ivy.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Absinthe-</strong></strong> Star anise, amber, spicy cinnamon, fresh green herbal notes blended with fennel, nutmeg and cassia laid down on a bed of woodsy accords.</p>
<p><strong>Witching Hour- </strong> This mysterious scent combines freshly ground cinnamon bark with earthy notes of musk, black tea and patchouli. This scent is rounded out with jasmine, cannabis and bergamot.<strong><br/></strong></p>

<p><b>UPDATE: </b>now that the goal has been reached, and with a few days before the deadline, I decided to add three more bath bombs to the list! </p>
<p>~Hello, I'm the Doctor. Now run! (Ninth Doctor, scent of Oud Wood: <br/>Warm and mysterious. Sensual, dark oud wood dominates the top of this woodsy fragrance and then the drydown balances it out with soft amber and white jasmine.)<br/>~Allons-y! (Tenth Doctor, scent of Cocobolo Wood: Think beautiful rich rosewood with a slight rose scent.)<br/>~Bow Ties Are Cool! (Eleventh Doctor, scent of Satsuma, both uplifting and energizing! A sweet, aromatic citrus blend of orange, mandarin, mango, jasmine, lime, peach and orange flowers.)<br/></p>
<p>Thank you all again! </p>

UPDATE: now that the goal has been reached, and with a few days before the deadline, I decided to add three more bath bombs to the list! 
~Hello, I'm the Doctor. Now run! (Ninth Doctor, scent of Oud Wood: Warm and mysterious. Sensual, dark oud wood dominates the top of this woodsy fragrance and then the drydown balances it out with soft amber and white jasmine.)~Allons-y! (Tenth Doctor, scent of Cocobolo Wood: Think beautiful rich rosewood with a slight rose scent.)~Bow Ties Are Cool! (Eleventh Doctor, scent of Satsuma, both uplifting and energizing! A sweet, aromatic citrus blend of orange, mandarin, mango, jasmine, lime, peach and orange flowers.)

To see the fragment of nature and to feel its essence and the importance of the moment. With photography, it all comes back to our memory, but with a richer and more meaningful appearance.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Greetings! My name is Alexei Svinarski (Lyosha). I am a 54 year old painter and photographer as well as the founder of a non-profit photography museum called the Urbana Museum of Photography (UMoP) located in Urbana, IL.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>After over two years of brainstorming and careful planing, in May of 2012, I opened the doors of the Urbana Museum of Photography. Apart from being a viewing area and showroom, the Museum is also structured as a small multifaced institution, covering Education, History, Art and Community as well as other fields of interest.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>With high ambitions, UMoP emphasizes traditional analog photography, considering it as an Art Form. -- teaching a Photo Class for kids ages 7 to 14 as well as holding workshops on pinhole cameras, tintypes , Dark Room processing and more. The space allows for simultaneous display of two different bodies of works  - the permanent collection of historic photographs of Urbana, IL (1800s-1900s) and contemporary regional and international photographic works.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In the first year of UMoP's existence, we held several field trips and workshops on the art of photography, we hosted 8 exhibitions of photographs by a total of 29 different artists from around the world. In response, we were also able to achieve recognition from numerous publications and were interviewed by local media and public radio stations. We have several hundred followers on our FB page and so far have received 100% positive feedback from the community.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>UMoP has manageded to operate through 2012 and 2013, partially by a personal loan and partially by my own professional income. With the expansion of our children's classes, our ever growing show openings and workshops we have reached a plateau, a point in which we need help from you all to be able to continue to grow not only the Museum but the Urbana Art Comminity as a whole.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My major concerns are rent and utilities for the year, as well as the costs for a non-profit status. Roughly $15,000 is needed for us to grow into where we need to be.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Through your contributions, we can finalize the Little School of Photography as well as continue to grow as a vital resource for our community.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>UMoP is the first and the only Museum of Photography in Champaign County, IL. Unfortunately, we do not have other previous models to follow, so we create as we go. After the few coming years of existence, we will be the model for somebody else to follow.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Please help us to continue our journey, contribute if you can, but also help us to spread the word, share it. </div>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><span>Hi, we are MA students graduating this year from the School of Media, Film and Music at <strong>Sussex University</strong>. </span>Every generation in this school has to showcase their works in a small gathering at the end of their programme.</p>
<p>But we are <strong>not the kind to settle for less</strong>:</p>
<p>'Stories and Spaces' is the first Postgraduate Media and Film Degree Show from Sussex University that aims not only to<strong> showcase the latest work</strong>, but also to evaluate it by having it <strong>judged by four leading professionals from the film and media industry: Daisy Asquith, Penny Woolcock, Mark Francis and Simon Fanshawe</strong>. </p>
<p>It also proposes to provide a meeting platform in between the industry and the graduates, by also being a <strong>self-standing networking event</strong>. The directors of the four best films chosen by the jury, will receive <strong>one-year subscriptions to Shooting People</strong> and <strong>short internships in award winning production companies</strong> Touch Productions and Back2back Productions. </p>
<p>But in order to make this happen, we need your help!</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3><span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></span></h3>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>Our funds application was awarded with a sum that only covers half of our budget. In order to be able to pay for printing the Degree Show catalogues and posters, as well as the rent for the event location, <strong>we need to raise another 1000 GBP by the 1st of September. </strong></span></p>
<div><span>Any sum of money will work though, as we are trying to first cover <strong>location costs: 650 GBP</strong>. The rest of<strong> 350 would go towards printing 200 poster-leaflets</strong> with the programe of the evening <strong>and about 100 catalogues</strong> with the full description of our projects and contact information. </span></div>
<div><span> </span></div>
<div><span>The initial numbers for printing were 400 posters and 200 catalogues, but we are aware this would imply more than 1000 GBP (1570 US Dollars)</span></div>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Finding a job after graduation can be very challenging, especially during recession. This event attempts to<strong> introduce the graduates to the Media and Film Industry</strong>, and offer them the valuable experience of presenting their work in a professional environment. </p>
<p>Even more so, it has not been easy but we are having as competition judges <strong>internationally acclaimed documentary film-makers and media icons</strong> like <strong>Daisy Asquith</strong> (<a href=""http://www.daisyasquith.co.uk/#/awards/4524420020"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.daisyasquith.co.uk/#/awards/4524420020</a>), <strong>Penny Woolcock</strong> (<a href=""http://www.pennywoolcock.co.uk/cv/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.pennywoolcock.co.uk/cv/</a>), <strong>Mark Francis</strong> (<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2126549/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2126549/</a>) and <strong>Simon Fanshawe</strong> (<a href=""http://simonfanshawe.com/?page_id=12"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://simonfanshawe.com/?page_id=12</a>). </p>
<p>Four of us will leave the evening with a short intership awarded, and many more with future job interviews.</p>
<p><strong>We believe in quality work, we have youth's enthusiasm and energy, and we are eager to get out there and reward you with great films!</strong></p>

It also proposes to provide a meeting platform in between the industry and the graduates, by also being a self-standing networking event. The directors of the four best films chosen by the jury, will receive one-year subscriptions to Shooting People and short internships in award winning production companies Touch Productions and Back2back Productions. 
But in order to make this happen, we need your help!
 

What We Need & What You Get



Our funds application was awarded with a sum that only covers half of our budget. In order to be able to pay for printing the Degree Show catalogues and posters, as well as the rent for the event location, we need to raise another 1000 GBP by the 1st of September. 
Any sum of money will work though, as we are trying to first cover location costs: 650 GBP. The rest of 350 would go towards printing 200 poster-leaflets with the programe of the evening and about 100 catalogues with the full description of our projects and contact information. 
 
The initial numbers for printing were 400 posters and 200 catalogues, but we are aware this would imply more than 1000 GBP (1570 US Dollars)
 


The Impact
Finding a job after graduation can be very challenging, especially during recession. This event attempts to introduce the graduates to the Media and Film Industry, and offer them the valuable experience of presenting their work in a professional environment. 
Even more so, it has not been easy but we are having as competition judges internationally acclaimed documentary film-makers and media icons like Daisy Asquith (http://www.daisyasquith.co.uk/#/awards/4524420020), Penny Woolcock (http://www.pennywoolcock.co.uk/cv/), Mark Francis (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2126549/) and Simon Fanshawe (http://simonfanshawe.com/?page_id=12). 
Four of us will leave the evening with a short intership awarded, and many more with future job interviews.
We believe in quality work, we have youth's enthusiasm and energy, and we are eager to get out there and reward you with great films!
Support us and we promise to give you good entertainment, both on the evening and for the rest of our future careers!

Students who complete all four modules receive a Certificate of Completion from Classical Drawing Academy.</span></p><div>
<p><i><b>Module One: Setup</b></i></p>
<p>The first module has three chapters about setting yourself up for success with the right materials, workspace, and body mechanics. It covers exactly which supplies to purchase and how to use them, plus how to set up a home or professional studio environment. While proper setup may require some adjustment, it eliminates struggle and frustration with the fundamental aspects of drawing so students can focus on building higher level skills.</p>
<p><i><b>Module Two: Block-In</b></i></p>
<p>A block-in is the first stage of a drawing. It looks like a two-dimensional blueprint and guides the completion of the drawing. The second module has four chapters that teach students how to draw a compelling and accurate block-in. These four chapters cover gesture, composition, perspective and anatomy. Together these chapters give students the tools to design and create an interpretation of our three-dimensional world on a flat piece of paper.</p>
<p><i><b>Module Three: Rendering</b></i></p>
<p>Rendering is the process of adding light, shadow and fine detail to a block-in, thereby producing a finished drawing. The four chapters of the rendering module cover shadow shapes, core shadows, highlights and halftones. Students are introduced to these concepts by drawing a gradient plus a simple object, then progress to successively more challenging subjects by working from photographs of a plaster cast and then the human figure.</p>
<p><i><b>Module Four: Thesis</b></i></p>
<p>For the thesis project students integrate everything learned during the course by developing a concept, setting up and lighting a still life, and completing a drawing. The thesis module also covers photographing work for reproduction or publishing online, and framing a drawing.</p>

<p>Successfully creating Classical Drawing Academy will require a diverse skill set, including producing instructional videos and building a web site.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Amoré and I am an upcoming makeup artist in Houston, Texas. Me entire life has revolved around art and making people smile. All through out middle and high school I was dedicated to my art classes, doodles, and sketches. It wasn't until my Junior year of High School that I decided to deem cosmetics as my official ""favorite"" medium of art. Not only that, but I've always felt such gratification from making people laugh, smile, or just feel better about themselves or their day in general. Artistically applying makeup gives me a feeling that I could never explain. So many different colors to choose from, blending them all so perfectly together, and the best part of all is that I can do this on a canvas that can actually emotionally show happiness as the result of my work. My perfect canvas is the skin of a person. Not only do I get the pleasure of creating art on a bride on her wedding day, a model for her headshots to be seen around the world, or just anyone wanting their face painted - I also get the pleasure of making people feel more beautiful than they already are. That happiness is something that I am always extremely grateful for!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>""RAW: natural born artist"" is an independant arts organization that is not only FOR artists, but its run BY artists. This organization hand picked me and asked me to showcase my work. The only way that RAW can keep showcasing local artists and their amazing artwork is by selling tickets. In order for me to showcase my makeup artistry, I need to sell 20 tickets @ $10 a ticket. So that's $200 to get me IN the showcase. On top of that, I just found out that I will be doing the makeup of 20+ models that are in the fashion portion of the show. This calculates to $300 for *enough makeup, lashes, and other various cosmetic products for a large number of people.<br/><br/>If I am not able to raise all the money needed (or if I exceed the amount needed) for this showcase, the money will go to marketing my business to greater hights!</p>
</div>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Being able to be in the RAW showcase will help my business in more ways than I could ever imagine. Since I just started my makeup company in April, I am a partime medical assistant for three hours a day, and the rest of the day I am a mommy and trying to promote my business in the most reasonably (free) priced way possible. It's very difficult to get my name out there just via the internet or flyers. There will be scouts and all kinds of other people that could help me get my career going. Not only that, but RAW has an Annual Indie Awards Show for their top artists. <span>The winners receive big career-boosting prizes like distribution, store placement, studio time, gallery placement and consultations with industry executives and professionals. I need to prove to myself, my daughter, family, friends, and everyone else... that dreams are NEVER a waste of time!

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>A Manuscript, that traveled around the world in a five years epic journey. A global collaboration of 91 artists. This campaign allows its author to carry it on foot to its conclusion in Cyprus, where it is eagerly awaited by the Cypriot media and galleries. A successful journey will be followed by a further campaign to secure its international publication.</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px; text-align: center;""><img alt=""The Painting"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://halkography.com/images/com_droppics/76/51b673f8dfbe4.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""The Painting""/></p>
<p>My name is Halkios. I am a poet, amateur photographer and web designer. I have also experimented with video art and I have worked with different genres of music: combining poetry, photography and music, to express my spiritual anxieties.  I have never published anything on paper before.  Mostly, I have been sharing these anxieties in social networks. Many of my art work today finds shelter in the pages of the Halkography website.  All my work has gradually lead to the project I present you; the project of the <strong>Diary of an Angel.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">THE PROJECT</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The project is one of a kind, a very unique art form in itself. It is a highly original concept, both abstract and concrete. It is genuine and enlightening. It is an art book, a manuscript, a valuable collection of images, sound and music, of poetry and prose. It is a documentary which gives both contributor and artists the ability to communicate and revaluate their beliefs on human collaboration and vision. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">ITS JOURNEY</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It has travelled around the world for five years, and so far 73 of them have written inside, placing their memories and dreams in the art form they represent. This includes poets, musicians, painters, spoken word artists, writers, lyricists, composers, singers, artisans, photographers, video artists, copywriters, radio presenters, video editors, a bell chimer and a luthier (<em>lute/bouzouki maker)</em>.  (For more please visit <a href=""http://halkography.com/the-diary-of-an-angel"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""The Diary of an Angel"">The Diary of an Angel</a>.)</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">ITS VISION</span></p>
<p>The Diary of an Angel combines the ancient and the modern; it also explores the concepts of individuality and universality. The art dedicated to this project is already much more that the leather bound pages of the book that it revolves around. It grew like a human child who has almost passed through adolescence and is waiting for  his/her rite of passage.  <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">There is vision.</span></p>
<p> <strong>ACHIEVEMENTS</strong></p>
<p>This Project is divided in four parts. So far the first two have already reached their goal in the past seven years by contacting and befriending 91 artists who have joined my adventure (please visit the webpage <a href=""http://halkography.com/the-angels-nest"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""The Angel's Nest"">Angel's Nest</a>, the chronicle of the first part, and the webpage <a href=""http://halkography.com/the-city-of-gold"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""The City of Gold"">City of Gold</a> to understand the concept of the second part and read about each artist). Please visit the <a href=""http://halkography.com/the-trail-of-dawn"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""The Trail of Dawn"">T</a><a href=""http://www.halkography.com/the-trail-of-dawn"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""The Trail of Dawn"">rail of Dawn</a> which is a chronicle of the Journey thus far, in the United States, Europe, and many other places around the world.</p>

<p>The next two parts forthcoming will consist of the completion of the journey and an exhibition, and the publication of the Diary and possibly a concert, all of which require funding. The total cost to complete these last two parts of the project is estimated to be US$ 42.4k (~32k € / ~£27.3k) and so it has been decided to split this into two campaigns, considering the urgency and time constraints on the first part. So this campaign is targeted to fund the last leg of the Journey which is:</p>
<ul>
<li>- To visit the last 18 artists in person and allow them to contribute their work in the Diary. It is my hope to celebrate the fifth year anniversary  (1st of August, 2013) by achieving the milestone of the completion of the Diary.</li>
<li>- To bring the completed Diary to its permanent home in Cyprus with a symbolic journey on foot, where I will circumnavigate the island, walking a distance of approx. 466 miles (750km), visiting 91 places of historical significance in all six districts such as archaeological sites temples, churches, mosques, schools, museums and galleries in less than a month, covering approx. 19 miles (30km) per day starting from the highest mountain (Troodos) and around the coast visiting the five capes and ending in Polis Chrysohous in the Akama peninsula (please visit <a href=""http://www.halkography.com/the-trail-of-dawn/the-land-of-venus"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""The Land of Venus"">The Land of Venus</a>). </li>
</ul><p>As I walk I will narrate the story of the City of Gold, its relationship with the Diary and its journey, and will take you on an exploration of 91 places in Cyprus, and present each corresponding artist and chapter from the Diary. You will have the opportunity to witness this live by going to the first page of the website <a href=""http://halkography.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Prolegomena"">Prolegomena</a>. </p>
<p>The footage from all these days will be edited in a documentary with narrations in three languages and it will be included in the published Diary. At this point I will return to the capital, Nicosia and end this part with a seven day exhibition of the Diary in the gallery of Argo.</p>
<p>It will exhibit the manuscript, the painting and the chest, and many of the artworks of the painters and artisans who have contributed to the Diary. At this point I will produce a CD and a DVD including all musical and video contributions to the Diary, and also make prints of the works of the painters Giclée or on canvas (see available perks on the right). </p>
<p>Those contributing to the campaign may choose to have their name appearing on the website of Halkography (please visit <a href=""http://halkography.com/the-city-of-gold/the-fourth-floor/artistic-siblings"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Artistic Siblings"">Artistic Siblings</a>) and may also use that website to follow the progress of the journey and eventual publication of the Diary. </p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></h3>
<p>For this campaign I need to raise a total US$ 15k (~11.3k € / ~£9.9k) to realize this part of the project, broken down as follows, so I can provide you the <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">music</span> of the musicians involved, a <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">3 hours documentary</span> of the landscapes of Cyprus, interracting with the local art world, to bring you close with her history to see live through my eyes and hear with my ears, the voices, the sounds and visit with me up to 91 places of Cyprus.</p>
<p>A. Travel Expenses</p>
<p>I need to travel in London, Greece, (Kozani, Athens) Crete (Herakleion), Israel (Ilania) and all six districts of Cyprus in the next three months. I will also need supplies and resources to accomblish the journey walking on the island for 28 days.</p>
<p>B. Production Expences</p>
<p>I am working closely with a recording studio and content publishers to produce a CD and a DVD featuring music and video of the Diary. There are basically four stages of these costs: production, pre-mastering (authoring, encoding, and formatting), applying the narration and subtitles, and finally the mastering and publication. It will contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>A documentary <em>Odoiporiko</em> with Greek, Turkish and English narration and choice of subtitles.</li>
<li>72 min. of music from the Diary (13 to 17 musical pieces).</li>
</ul><p>By asking you to buy your copy or copies before they're printed, we not only make sure we don't waste resources by producing exactly the number we need, but we save money—for you, and for The Diary of an Angel.</p>
<p>C. Technical Expences</p>
<p>Contributions to the campaign will also be used to provide the equipment and technical support needed to produce a video recording of my journey through Cyprus and facilitate a live broadcast as I walk.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img alt="""" class=""art-lightbox lazy"" data-src=""http://halkography.com/images/Images%20General/akamaspegias05.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> <span style=""font-family: 'Dancing Script', Arial, 'Arial Unicode MS', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 22px; line-height: 26px; font-weight: bold;"">The Campaign</span></p>
<p>If this campaign is succesful, we will start another campaign to finance the publication of the Diary. Those who contribute $50 or more to this campaign, will be eligible to purchase the Diary at 50% off.</p>
<p>If the campaign does not reach the goal, priority will be given to the funding necessary to complete the Diary and present it to Cyprus as a gift. Production of the CD/DVD and video/webcast of the Journey through Cyprus is contigent upon the succes of the campaign.</p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Impact</span></h3>
<p>The Diary will remind people of the importance of keeping conventional art alive and available, and that technology is here to serve us and not us to serve technology. – Whereas a button can delete blogs and the works of thousand artists, dismissing the passion and work they had put into both physical and mentally, a Diary, or a painting can keep word and art and sheets of music for much longer. It is tangible and permanent. Keeping the balance between the two worlds is essential for humankind to come into peace with their needs both pshysical and spiritual.</p>
<p>Art is an expression of honesty and freedom, the Diary being a manuscript expresses itself without fear of being copied, pasted dragged and dropped.</p>
<p>First and foremost most its importance lies in its message. It has been written to spread the message of unconditional love and friendship.</p>

A Manuscript, that traveled around the world in a five years epic journey. A global collaboration of 91 artists. This campaign allows its author to carry it on foot to its conclusion in Cyprus, where it is eagerly awaited by the Cypriot media and galleries. A successful journey will be followed by a further campaign to secure its international publication.

My name is Halkios. I am a poet, amateur photographer and web designer. I have also experimented with video art and I have worked with different genres of music: combining poetry, photography and music, to express my spiritual anxieties.  I have never published anything on paper before.  Mostly, I have been sharing these anxieties in social networks. Many of my art work today finds shelter in the pages of the Halkography website.  All my work has gradually lead to the project I present you; the project of the Diary of an Angel.
THE PROJECT
The project is one of a kind, a very unique art form in itself. It is a highly original concept, both abstract and concrete. It is genuine and enlightening. It is an art book, a manuscript, a valuable collection of images, sound and music, of poetry and prose. It is a documentary which gives both contributor and artists the ability to communicate and revaluate their beliefs on human collaboration and vision. 
ITS JOURNEY
It has travelled around the world for five years, and so far 73 of them have written inside, placing their memories and dreams in the art form they represent. This includes poets, musicians, painters, spoken word artists, writers, lyricists, composers, singers, artisans, photographers, video artists, copywriters, radio presenters, video editors, a bell chimer and a luthier (lute/bouzouki maker).  (For more please visit The Diary of an Angel.)
 
ITS VISION
The Diary of an Angel combines the ancient and the modern; it also explores the concepts of individuality and universality. The art dedicated to this project is already much more that the leather bound pages of the book that it revolves around. It grew like a human child who has almost passed through adolescence and is waiting for  his/her rite of passage.  There is vision.
 ACHIEVEMENTS
This Project is divided in four parts. So far the first two have already reached their goal in the past seven years by contacting and befriending 91 artists who have joined my adventure (please visit the webpage Angel's Nest, the chronicle of the first part, and the webpage City of Gold to understand the concept of the second part and read about each artist). Please visit the Trail of Dawn which is a chronicle of the Journey thus far, in the United States, Europe, and many other places around the world.
 
The next two parts forthcoming will consist of the completion of the journey and an exhibition, and the publication of the Diary and possibly a concert, all of which require funding. The total cost to complete these last two parts of the project is estimated to be US$ 42.4k (~32k € / ~£27.3k) and so it has been decided to split this into two campaigns, considering the urgency and time constraints on the first part. So this campaign is targeted to fund the last leg of the Journey which is:

- To visit the last 18 artists in person and allow them to contribute their work in the Diary. It is my hope to celebrate the fifth year anniversary  (1st of August, 2013) by achieving the milestone of the completion of the Diary.
- To bring the completed Diary to its permanent home in Cyprus with a symbolic journey on foot, where I will circumnavigate the island, walking a distance of approx. 466 miles (750km), visiting 91 places of historical significance in all six districts such as archaeological sites temples, churches, mosques, schools, museums and galleries in less than a month, covering approx. 19 miles (30km) per day starting from the highest mountain (Troodos) and around the coast visiting the five capes and ending in Polis Chrysohous in the Akama peninsula (please visit The Land of Venus). 
As I walk I will narrate the story of the City of Gold, its relationship with the Diary and its journey, and will take you on an exploration of 91 places in Cyprus, and present each corresponding artist and chapter from the Diary. You will have the opportunity to witness this live by going to the first page of the website Prolegomena. 
The footage from all these days will be edited in a documentary with narrations in three languages and it will be included in the published Diary. At this point I will return to the capital, Nicosia and end this part with a seven day exhibition of the Diary in the gallery of Argo.
It will exhibit the manuscript, the painting and the chest, and many of the artworks of the painters and artisans who have contributed to the Diary. At this point I will produce a CD and a DVD including all musical and video contributions to the Diary, and also make prints of the works of the painters Giclée or on canvas (see available perks on the right). 
Those contributing to the campaign may choose to have their name appearing on the website of Halkography (please visit Artistic Siblings) and may also use that website to follow the progress of the journey and eventual publication of the Diary. 
What We Need & What You Get
For this campaign I need to raise a total US$ 15k (~11.3k € / ~£9.9k) to realize this part of the project, broken down as follows, so I can provide you the music of the musicians involved, a 3 hours documentary of the landscapes of Cyprus, interracting with the local art world, to bring you close with her history to see live through my eyes and hear with my ears, the voices, the sounds and visit with me up to 91 places of Cyprus.
A. Travel Expenses
I need to travel in London, Greece, (Kozani, Athens) Crete (Herakleion), Israel (Ilania) and all six districts of Cyprus in the next three months. I will also need supplies and resources to accomblish the journey walking on the island for 28 days.
B. Production Expences
I am working closely with a recording studio and content publishers to produce a CD and a DVD featuring music and video of the Diary. There are basically four stages of these costs: production, pre-mastering (authoring, encoding, and formatting), applying the narration and subtitles, and finally the mastering and publication. It will contain:

A documentary Odoiporiko with Greek, Turkish and English narration and choice of subtitles.
72 min. of music from the Diary (13 to 17 musical pieces).
By asking you to buy your copy or copies before they're printed, we not only make sure we don't waste resources by producing exactly the number we need, but we save money—for you, and for The Diary of an Angel.
C. Technical Expences
Contributions to the campaign will also be used to provide the equipment and technical support needed to produce a video recording of my journey through Cyprus and facilitate a live broadcast as I walk.

 The Campaign
If this campaign is succesful, we will start another campaign to finance the publication of the Diary. Those who contribute $50 or more to this campaign, will be eligible to purchase the Diary at 50% off.
If the campaign does not reach the goal, priority will be given to the funding necessary to complete the Diary and present it to Cyprus as a gift. Production of the CD/DVD and video/webcast of the Journey through Cyprus is contigent upon the succes of the campaign.
The Impact
The Diary will remind people of the importance of keeping conventional art alive and available, and that technology is here to serve us and not us to serve technology. – Whereas a button can delete blogs and the works of thousand artists, dismissing the passion and work they had put into both physical and mentally, a Diary, or a painting can keep word and art and sheets of music for much longer. It is tangible and permanent. Keeping the balance between the two worlds is essential for humankind to come into peace with their needs both pshysical and spiritual.
Art is an expression of honesty and freedom, the Diary being a manuscript expresses itself without fear of being copied, pasted dragged and dropped.
First and foremost most its importance lies in its message. It has been written to spread the message of unconditional love and friendship.

Each piece will center the viewer on the political, social, and economic dynamics of constructing identity in the world at large.</p>
<p>IndieGoGo is a ""crowdfunding"" platform that allows emerging artists who don't have the backing of galleries or museums to ask for contributions from people like you to help produce their work. Our goal of this summary is to help you understand the message behind our work, what you are considering funding, and how it will reach people.</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>We will be creating paintings that document 'Identity Work' (concept explained below)</li>
<li>Your funds will go to art supplies, surfaces, and studio space</li>
<li>We will be organizing an exhibition of the work and speaking engagements</li>
</ol>
<div>Many people, not just people of color or people with disabilities, do Identity Work for the benefit of society. It is isolating work to have to control how you project yourself, and it interferes with the self-awareness tasks we take for granted. These paintings will be evidence to other Identity Workers that they are not alone in the work they do, and will affirm that it is <i>real work</i> that drains you of energy and resources.</div>
<h1><b>Concept</b></h1>
<p>Mike is a black artist. Matt is an artist with epilepsy. Both explore the ways their identity has been shaped by society's reaction to them as such<br/></p>
<p>The series is meant to portray 'Identity Work', the daily work people do to make society feel comfortable. An 'Identity Worker' is someone must modify how they present discomforting parts of their identity; in the case of race or disability, the goal might be to be perceived as not a threat, or not too dependent. This is intense, emotional work that Identity Workers do every day. These paintings will affirm the labor of Identity Workers and document it so that the rest of the world can see what it looks like.</p>
<p>Often, we focus on exceptional people; unfortunately this puts a lot of pressure on the rest of us and our day to day performance of this work. It sets up a dichotomy where some are viewed as less admirable or unworthy. This can isolate people, or foster resentment. These paintings are going to be a tool to help build community around Identity Work, and show that others are doing this work and it is not some solitary struggle.</p>

The ""Us"" 


We work on large format paintings that are confrontational and challenging for the viewer. Depending on the context, we would both be considered Identity Workers, and we want to foster critical discussions of the “solved” status of Identity Work, specifically around race and disability. This series of pieces intends to portray the continuation of this process of Identity Work, and how its collisions with the normative stare affects Identity Workers.

Michael has established himself working in acrylic media creating monumental faces with airbrush and paint, and performing live action painting for audiences. Michael is originally from Cleveland and studied at SAIC.
Matt's works primarily in oil paint, but also focuses on detailing internal struggles through portraiture with mixed media pieces using spray paint and paint marker. Matt is originally from Youngstown and studied at YSU.
What We Need & What You Get Budget Details:

Total - $8900
Painting Materials for ""Terraforming Faces"" - $600
Expenses - $8300 (studio space, archival scans, perks, etc)
For a detailed, line by line budget, you can visit this link

Perks summary:

You did good for us
You did good for the people we reach
You'll get public thanks for that extra contribution
You'll get goodies for that - postcards!

You'll get a public thank you at the opening
MOAR GOODIES! - Limited Edition print of the works!

ALL the Goodies, a Spotlight, and your name/logo on the flyer

What will your support look like?
Funds contributed to our campaign not only net you the perks above, but will help us create art and exhibit it for the benefit of Identity Workers.
If we're shy on our goal?


Expenses in the budget are listed in order of priority. Although us paying ourselves is pretty critical, it is subordinate to getting funding for surfaces, supplies and spaces. 


Basically, our minimum to launch is $4000, but the goal will help ensure the success of the show and continuance of the series
 

If we exceed our goal?

We are looking at this project as having the potential to generate a total of three series of works.
The first segment, ""Terraforming Faces"" is all about how we construct these identities. The second and third segments involve engaging the Stare as an entity on its own, and how specific individuals have dealt with it.
If we exceed our goal, we will set aside the additional funds to start funding the other segments.

  The Impact 



This project is likely to represent a broad base of individuals beyond the boundaries of race or disability. In particular, it is meant to add voice to individuals trampled by the stare of privilege. The aim is to aid in providing a critical framework for discussing the issues around privilege construing identity into some sort of weapon used by social deviants.Further, it is intended to be engaging for people that do not fall too far outside the boundaries of traditional privilege structures. While this explores issues for those affected by the violence of privilege based on traits like race, gender, sexuality, and disability, it is meant to create a space for people with privilege to come to an understanding of what being without it is like.
Contributing to our project will help us continue building out this critical framework.

Risks & Challenges 


We have blindspots. We cannot pretend to represent all people, nor would we want our work to be construed as demonstrating more than what we have experienced. Each person has unexamined privilege somewhere.
Our obligation is to be critical of ourselves, to call out our own problematic behaviors, and accept criticism when it happens. This work you are funding revolves around the creators' collective and individual vulnerabilities in an effort to center viewers on the experience of this labor. We will bring honest work.

<h3>Our Story</h3>Hi Everyone, my name is Ben Graham-Putter and I am one of the Co-Founders of BrickHaus Art Space, a Baltimore-based art center that is committed to fostering personal and professional artistic development 
through studio space, shared technical 
facilities, gallery space, and a forum for critique and lectures. <br/><br/>My friend Adam Farkas and I had just graduated from art school and were looking for studio spaces in the area, but were unable to find adequate facilities at a price we could afford. It was shortly after this realization that we decided that if we couldn't find such a space, we needed to make one. After a month or two of searching, we found an old storage warehouse in Baltimore City's Harwood neighborhood. With 15,000 square feet, plenty of windows, and a freight elevator that could fit a car, this space was exactly what we were looking for. <br/><br/>In March of 2011 we moved in and got to work. The project has taken a huge amount of personal energy, and has been the destination of every extra dollar either of us have earned. Between the two of us, we have put in over $35,000 and countless hours making BrickHaus what it is today, a growing community of artists working in one space, sharing ideas, and inspiring one another. <br/><p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact <br/>
</h3>We are currently struggling to keep the building warm for our artists, but the space heaters just aren't doing it. We managed to get 4 heating units to heat our spaces, and everything is ready to be hooked up. All we needed was gas service. We had budgeted for about $75 to restart our gas service (this is the figure we got from the website), but when we heard from our utility company that our existing service line was outdated, that number jumped to the $5,000 - $7,000 range! We have managed to do a lot with the money that we have, but this is outside of our ability to fund ourselves.<br/><br/>It is quite a testament to our resident artists that they have been working in their studios everyday despite the cold temperatures, but it is only getting colder and this winter will get very tough without our heat being turned on. I am concerned that without heat, we will be unable to work, and unable to make art, which will be a huge hit to our organization.<br/><p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get <br/>
</h3>We are looking to raise $7,000 to install a new gas service to our building. The money will pay for digging up the road, and connecting our building to the main gas line. It will also pay for a gas meter (only about $75 worth of the overall cost). If we cannot reach our goal, the money we do raise will still go to this project and we will have to find another way (loans, selling stuff, working nights) to fund the remainder of the project.<br/><br/>Anyone who is able to donate to this project will get their name on our website in a special thanks section, and those who give over $30 will receive a logo t-shirt. The $250 giving level will also receive a personal thank you card from all of us here at BrickHaus. For donations larger than $1000 you will also get your name on a plaque in our gallery.<br/><p><br/></p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Spread the word about our cause! Tweet us! Facebook us! We can't do this without your help and support, and if you can't personally give, maybe you know someone who can. Get the word out, and help BrickHaus stay Mighty!<br/></p>

<p>Ruben Gonzales - an artist and small business owner of 11<sup>th</sup> Monk3y, Erik Erspamer - an artist and teacher, other local artists and bike enthusiasts have teamed up to create the Art In Motion project.  Our project team will work with high school students in Phoenix, Arizona to build art bikes for the Scottsdale Public Art – Canal Convergence in November 2013.  The art bikes will be utilized during the bike parade, parked as freestanding sculptures and to host art activities.  After the Canal Convergence the bikes will be part of an exhibition at the Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art (SMoCA) and on display during First Fridays at Roosevelt Row in Phoenix, Arizona.</p>
<p>Art bikes are an exciting intersection of the arts and sciences that require students to work collaboratively to combine fine art, design, math and engineering skills. We will be working with local artists, bike enthusiasts and other art students to design and build kinetic works of art.</p>
<p>Our goal is to design and build two (2) art bikes and one (1) multiuse art bike with an attached gallery and project center. Our wish is to inspire Canal Convergance visitors to create and contribute to our art bikes and gallery. </p>
<p>We will start designing and building the art bikes in August 2013 and complete them by the end of October 2013.  Check our Updates section frequently for design notes and progress photos of our bikes.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Awesome art bikes on the web:</p>

<h2><strong>What We Need</strong></h2>
<p>Your support is crucial to bring our art bike designs to life!  We have already been hard at work collecting donated bikes, scrap metal and welding supplies.  Now we need to purchase bike-related tools, equipment and other various parts (tubes, tires, seats, chains, pedals, etc.) to refurbish the bikes and make them safe for riders.</p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $500.00 to purchase two (2) bicycle repair stands, two (2) sets of bike tools and various bike parts to get our art bikes moving and safe to ride!  See our complete list of tools, equipment and supplies in the gallery section.</p>
<p>Every dollar counts, BUT if we don’t quite make our goal we will reduce the number of tools, equipment and continue to seek local donations.  Reducing the stands and tools will impact how fast we will be able to build the bikes and may require us to eliminate one (1) of the art bikes.   Our hope is to make our stretch goals of building two (2) additional art bikes!!!</p>

<h2><strong>What You Get</strong></h2>
<p>To thank our amazing and generous supporters!  We are offering some special perks and original artworks produced by our students and local artists. Check out the list on the right or look in the perk section below for a clear breakdown. We will be adding more perks and updating our page so check back often!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<p>The impact of successfully funding our project is huge!  It will allow 30+ sculpture students to work collaboratively with local artists and enthusiasts to design and build the art bikes.  Additionally, it will allow hundreds of Canal Convergence and Roosevelt Row First Fridays visitors to view, interact, and contribute their own artwork to the art bikes. </p>
<p>Your support also has lasting effects by allowing our team to continue this project with future team members building additional art bikes and kinetic sculptures!</p>
<p>Check the Updates section regularly for our art bike designs, building progress, exhibition schedules and public artworks.</p>

<p> </p></div>","Our Story
Ruben Gonzales - an artist and small business owner of 11th Monk3y, Erik Erspamer - an artist and teacher, other local artists and bike enthusiasts have teamed up to create the Art In Motion project.  Our project team will work with high school students in Phoenix, Arizona to build art bikes for the Scottsdale Public Art – Canal Convergence in November 2013.  The art bikes will be utilized during the bike parade, parked as freestanding sculptures and to host art activities.  After the Canal Convergence the bikes will be part of an exhibition at the Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art (SMoCA) and on display during First Fridays at Roosevelt Row in Phoenix, Arizona.
Art bikes are an exciting intersection of the arts and sciences that require students to work collaboratively to combine fine art, design, math and engineering skills. We will be working with local artists, bike enthusiasts and other art students to design and build kinetic works of art.
Our goal is to design and build two (2) art bikes and one (1) multiuse art bike with an attached gallery and project center. Our wish is to inspire Canal Convergance visitors to create and contribute to our art bikes and gallery. 
We will start designing and building the art bikes in August 2013 and complete them by the end of October 2013.  Check our Updates section frequently for design notes and progress photos of our bikes.
Awesome art bikes on the web:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_bike
http://www.austinbikezoo.org/
What We Need
Your support is crucial to bring our art bike designs to life!  We have already been hard at work collecting donated bikes, scrap metal and welding supplies.  Now we need to purchase bike-related tools, equipment and other various parts (tubes, tires, seats, chains, pedals, etc.) to refurbish the bikes and make them safe for riders.
Our goal is to raise $500.00 to purchase two (2) bicycle repair stands, two (2) sets of bike tools and various bike parts to get our art bikes moving and safe to ride!  See our complete list of tools, equipment and supplies in the gallery section.
Every dollar counts, BUT if we don’t quite make our goal we will reduce the number of tools, equipment and continue to seek local donations.  Reducing the stands and tools will impact how fast we will be able to build the bikes and may require us to eliminate one (1) of the art bikes.   Our hope is to make our stretch goals of building two (2) additional art bikes!!!
Check out the diagram below for more info:
 
What You Get
To thank our amazing and generous supporters!  We are offering some special perks and original artworks produced by our students and local artists. Check out the list on the right or look in the perk section below for a clear breakdown. We will be adding more perks and updating our page so check back often!
 
The Impact
The impact of successfully funding our project is huge!  It will allow 30+ sculpture students to work collaboratively with local artists and enthusiasts to design and build the art bikes.  Additionally, it will allow hundreds of Canal Convergence and Roosevelt Row First Fridays visitors to view, interact, and contribute their own artwork to the art bikes. 
Your support also has lasting effects by allowing our team to continue this project with future team members building additional art bikes and kinetic sculptures!
Check the Updates section regularly for our art bike designs, building progress, exhibition schedules and public artworks.
 
Other Ways You Can Help

Please help us spread the word by using the sharing tools on indiegogo.com and email the project link to your friends!
 If you are local to the Phoenix area:

Come and join us at the Canal Convergence in November 2013 - http://www.scottsdalepublicart.org/events/canal-convergence/

You can donate your extra hand tools or equipment to our project.  Please take a look at our tools and equipment list. Contact us to pick up your items.

Although we have already received some great bikes, bike parts and supplies, we could still use more!  Really anything can help and maybe used in our final designs. (seats, pedals, chains, 26” tubes, mirrors, handlebars, etc.) Contact us to pick up your items.

<h3></h3>In 2005, LithiumDreams Photography slowly moving toward artistic photography leaving the fashion world behind there is more satisfaction and acceptance in that realm of work when it comes to our style of work. My first published pieces were in a magazine out of England called The Serpent in 2007. Moving to Atlanta, Georgia in 2007 gave me more opportunity to show my art is local galleries, LithiumDreams joined forces with Morbidly Beautiful Art bring that next step of creativity to our work. Started networking with fellow alternative and fetish photographers and models we have build a solid network of contacts and associates.<br/>We have grow out of three studios and now  have a large studio in the country outside of Atlanta, allowing me to expand our work and space.  In 2010 LithiumDreams was accepted into the what was called at the time Ikros Art Collective, and our art traveled around the Southeast being displayed in fetish galleries and events.  LithiumDreams was just recently published in Gorgeous Freaks Magazine issue 19,  and show annually at Frolicon art show, Frolicon is an alternative and fetish convention in Atlanta held in the spring. Then in late summer annually show art at the Art of Kink art show held at Fetishcon in Tampa, Fla. Plus work shows in many local art shows annually as well etching a style and respect from fellow artist. Our work is recognized in many states and regions of the US, due to unique outlook and style created from dreams,friends dreams, music and stories.

November 15th we need to make a decision if our art will be in this art show, We have a large amount of art already edited and ready for printing for this kind of show we are adding to it as much as I can between now and then. My work shows the raw unedited fetish world, it is not all glamour and polished as many photographers want to depict it. The art takes the viewer into the scene and creates emotion so in a still image you are feeling what the person in the pictures is feeling, it is fun and edgy as art should be but it is real and draws you in.<br/>My purpose here is to raise $600.00 to cover resignation and submission cost, printing, framing and shipping both way to the gallery in Los Angeles.

<h3><strong>A Short Summary</strong></h3>
<p>Erica Lord and (former partner) TH are beginning a creative alliance of epic proportions! This summer, in partnership with Calgary’s <em>The New Gallery</em> and Edmonton’s <em>The Works: Art &amp; Design Festival</em>, internationally recognized artists Erica Lord and (former partner TH) are collaborating on a series of exciting new works. They have sought this artistic partnership for years and starting in June, they are finally coming together for the first time! During June and July, Lord will be the artist in residence at <em>The New Gallery, John Snow House</em> (Calgary, AB). During this time, the artists will conceptualize the ideas they've outlined together, work with a variety of mediums, and conclude by collaborating and producing a series of new work including photography, video, printmaking, installation, new media, performance, and public interventions. A number of these performance works will be presented at <em>The Works: Art &amp; Design Festival</em>, in Edmonton, June 20-July 2, 2013. The artists’ goal is to create a catalog and exhibition, which will include the documentation of these performances along with the other art pieces they create during this time. Lord and TH are seeking your support to help cover the cost of travel and production of art works, performances, and documentation. The New Gallery has generously supported us with housing and studio space; it is our responsibility to raise funds for the materials, production, and presentation. Please consider helping these two dynamic artists carry out their unique and exciting project by giving your support. In exchange for your help, Lord and (former partner TH)  are offering a number of gifts including art catalogs, Lord/TH stickers and shirts, and limited edition photographs, serigraph and letterpress prints.</p>
<h3>Darkness in the North, Full Description</h3>
<p><em>Darkness in the North</em> is a collaborative art project inspired by Bruce Springsteen’s album, <em>Darkness on the Edge of Town</em>; Lord and TH found significant meaning in the songs and stories in <em>Darkness</em>, drawing connections to Indigenous peoples’ relationship with the dark, night, urban and rural experiences and the relationships connecting all of those elements. Using this inspiration as their launching point, the artists will collaborate on a series of new works at the John Snow House, where Lord will live, thanks to the support they are receiving from <em>The New Gallery’s</em> Artist in Residence program.</p>
<p>This project is a first collaboration by the artists, who first became friends several years ago when they were simultaneously highlighted as the feature artists on the <em>Native American Indigenous Cinema and Arts</em> website. Realizing they shared many artistic interests and important connections in their work, they hoped to some day work together—this project would finally allow the opportunity for this long-awaited collaboration.</p>
<p>The artists’ intention is to create a body of work involving ideas drawn from Springsteen’s <em>Darkness</em> album. Drawn to the universality of these stories, the artists found inspiration in the narratives of working class people, love and loss, the passion of youth, the reality of aging, the birth of new and the passing of older generations, individuality, community, and the rebellious spirit— all of these things connect us and helps create our identities. The artists’ process will begin with material experiments and intensive research in and around Calgary and Southern Alberta. They will connect and work with local artists, musicians, and artist run centers to create and present their art works. Lord and TH have planned to create a number of different series in a variety of mediums; their projects will include printmaking, photography, video, performance, site-specific works, and more. Since Lord and (former partner TH) have worked toward this union and collaboration for many years, they are confident that their driven and ambitious spirits will support both the scale and vision of this exciting project.</p>
<p>Erica Lord and (former partner TH) are both interdisciplinary media artists who have exhibited nationally and internationally and in many key exhibitions, they have been featured together. Erica Lord is a mixed-race Alaska Native artist who grew up between interior Alaska and Upper Michigan. TH is from Alberta and a member of the Blood Tribe, currently living and working in Calgary. Friends and colleagues for seven years, this project will be the first time Lord and TH will meet and work together.</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p><em>The New Gallery</em> and <em>The Works Festival</em> have generously provided us with the necessary bridge to bring us together at the creative think tank called the John Snow House in lovely Calgary, AB. We found a way to come together, we have the studio and time to develop our ideas, what remains is the production and presentation of the work. Creating and presenting work can get expensive and we have been working hard to come up with funding through every possible avenue; we chose to use IndieGoGo so we could offer some of our work in exchange for your valued support. Any size donation is valued and we’ve chosen a variety of gifts we believe you will like. Our goal of $3000 would cover the majority of our costs; if we are not able to reach our full goal, we will try and maximize the funds we do raise. The more money we raise, the more art we will be able to create and finish; our ideas are abundant, but our resources are limited. We are filled with excitement, creativity, and big ideas! Every donation will help some part of our art production—the more help we receive, the closer we will get to fulfilling our goal. Please consider supporting us in our project and goals; in exchange, you will have a part in the creation of important new works as well as a heartfelt thank you and a unique gift from both artists.</p>
<p>Ever wondered what went into creating an art piece? Your donation would support a variety of things including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supply and material costs for studio based works</li>
<li>Paper and substrate for prints, stickers, &amp; posters</li>

<li>Fabric and sewing materials</li>
<li>Photography and video documentation</li>
<li>Camera equipment rental—lenses &amp; lighting</li>
<li>Audio recording equipment rental</li>
<li>Meals</li>
<li>Transportation costs </li>
</ul><p>As a thank you for your support, we are offering:</p>

<li><strong>La Revolución! Stickers</strong></li>
<li><strong><em>GIVN'R- Perk pulled, alternatives currently being offered*</em><br/></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Danse Sauvage</em>, a limited edition photograph by Erica Lord</strong></li>
<li><strong>La Revolución! Printed t-shirts</strong></li>
<li><strong>Limited edition Letterpress Prints</strong></li>
<li><strong>Limited edition Serigraph Prints</strong></li>
</ul><p>Please consider supporting the collaboration. The Revolución is promising to be epic, stunning, and memorable. We hope you will join us and help us to reach our goal!</p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Your contribution will help two of North America's notable and dynamic Indigenous artists to create a new body of work that explores Indigenous people, identity, culture, and the stories and profound symbolism of <em>Darkness</em>. This project is deeply significant to the artists; your support and funding would be invaluable, as it would allow them to finally carry out their ideas and aspirations, assisting in the movement of their concepts into final creation. As supporters of the <em>Darkness</em> project, you will have the first opportunity to view and own some of the new art works, created during the residence. Projects will involve the mediums of photography, video, performance, music, storytelling and print media. Your support and funding will help these two critically acclaimed and widely recognized contemporary artists add to their significant and important bodies of work; this collaboration means a great deal to both of these artists. Your support will not only help to promote the work of these two unique artists, but will also help promote contemporary Indigenous art, assisting in creating exhibition and screening possibilities.</p>
<p>Currently, you can see the work of Lord and TH at the National Gallery of Canada in the exhibition <em>Sakahán: International Indigenous Art</em>. This exhibition features the performance based photographic and video works of both artists, with a billboard project by TH featured in Ottawa’s ByWard district.

<p>*This campaign supported the partnership during June through July 2, the partnership unfortunately dissolved after July 11. I am still working on the artwork and will contact all supporters for options/alternative gifts due to this change. Due to this division my former partner has asked that I remove his name from the campaign and therefore is only referenced by initials or as ""my former partner.""</p>
<p>*Perks listing his name have been removed and those funders affected by the change to perks have and will be contacted and the printing and creation of work continues.</p>

I invite everyone to spread the word and share this campaign with anyone that may be interested in the work of Lord, as well as anyone who may be interested in visual and performing arts, Indigenous culture or politics, the stories and dreams “the Boss” inspires, or Darkness, whether it be Darkness on the Edge of Town or Darkness in the North. Help me spread the word and find support for what I know will be an important project. Thank you for your consideration and support!
Your loyal and dedicated artist,
Erica Lord
*This campaign supported the partnership during June through July 2, the partnership unfortunately dissolved after July 11. I am still working on the artwork and will contact all supporters for options/alternative gifts due to this change. Due to this division my former partner has asked that I remove his name from the campaign and therefore is only referenced by initials or as ""my former partner.""
*Perks listing his name have been removed and those funders affected by the change to perks have and will be contacted and the printing and creation of work continues.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><strong>Hello and welcome to the June/July Cyantian Chronicles Funding Run!<br/></strong></p>
<p>If you are not familiar with the Cyantian Chronicles, you can check it out online at <a href=""http://cyantian.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">cyantian.net</a>.  It's a series of several different stories set in the same universe featuring anthropomorphic characters.  Each story has its own subarchive and I recommend you begin with the one marked <a href=""http://cyantian.net/campus/2012/07/09/campus-safari-chapter-0/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Campus Safari</a>.  The age rating is PG-13, on the low end.</p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>If you are a reader, you know I'm having some laptop issues, as in, my laptop is old and it's not happy to be doing the workload I've been doing on it.  It's away for repairs and costing me every day it's away, so I'm going to run this little fundraiser to get myself back in the red and get some artwork done!  So this money, where's it going?  Supplies.  A portion toward my Note (This thing is so awesome for all my scripting needs!!)  A little put back for the Yiynova MSP19U I want ($600)  I don't intend to get it until this fall.  A little put back for the full mouth replacement.  Long story, genetics turned against me.  And some for routine groceries, gas and other stuff.  And now, on to the tiers!  (Nothing goes to ANYTHING fun unless the pledger wants it to, and those are limited. :D :D)</p>
<p>Little note here:  There will be another book drive a bit later.  For now, this is a small thing and new things are subject to be added when I get my tablet back.  It's supposed to come back after July 9th.  I'm tossing the idea around of printing the original Campus Safari one time in nice professional printed volumes.</p>
<p>The goal is set at $500, although my personal goal is $600, that's a standard $300 for each month of work.  The minimum is $500 and if it's not met, they take 9% instead of 4%, so I do need the minimum met.  The good thing is, I don't have to wait for funds!</p>
<p><strong>Once this goal is met, I will be able to accept orders via mail and other methods.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Now for the perks! </strong> I am restraining myself, because 1.  I am one person and 2.  I already have a lot of work I have to do, but if you don't want a plush, there are art options!  I may add new perks as it goes along.  For Indiegogo, you can select more than one perk by simply doing them one at a time or combine them in one and send me a note at the end of the campaign.</p>

the Minister has issued Decree 49, temporarily suspending the

rights of women who choose to breastfeed in public. The first stage 
focuses on conveying information about breastfeeding through an art 
exhibit that includes various aesthetic genres such as poetry, graphic 
design, printing, music, photography, sculpture and painting. There will also be an informational panel on both Saturdays with lactation experts from WIC and La Leche League San Francisco, mothers and artists. The event 
will be held from August 16-22, 2014 in San Francisco, California</p><p><span>The inspiration for this project comes from a unpleasant experience I 
had this year with an employee of the Department of Motor Vehicles of 
San Francisco who not only said ""That 's Nasty,"" but also asked me to go
 to the bathroom or car (on a very hot day), or anywhere but the bench 
that is located outside of the building. According to her, I was 
“exposing myself” (her words) and she just wanted to protect the public 
from that. I then realized I live in a city with amazing resources

rights of women who choose to breastfeed in public. The first stage 
focuses on conveying information about breastfeeding through an art 
exhibit that includes various aesthetic genres such as poetry, graphic 
design, printing, music, photography, sculpture and painting. There will also be an informational panel on both Saturdays with lactation experts from WIC and La Leche League San Francisco, mothers and artists. The event 
will be held from August 16-22, 2014 in San Francisco, CaliforniaThe inspiration for this project comes from a unpleasant experience I 
had this year with an employee of the Department of Motor Vehicles of 
San Francisco who not only said ""That 's Nasty,"" but also asked me to go
 to the bathroom or car (on a very hot day), or anywhere but the bench 
that is located outside of the building. According to her, I was 
“exposing myself” (her words) and she just wanted to protect the public 
from that. I then realized I live in a city with amazing resources 
(latching, peer support, biting, etc.), but I couldn’t find anyone 
doing public advocacy work. Based on this experience we decided to expand
 the project into a second stage, the launching of the www.urbanlactionproject.org, a
website where people can use social media to track and document their
experience while breastfeeding at individual public locations such as
restaurants, coffee shops, government buildings, beaches, parks, banks, etc. We
believe this part of the project will hold lots of people accountable for their
actions. At the same time it can serve as an educational tool for those who are
unaware of the implications that come with making a woman feel uncomfortable
while attempting to do what she perceive is best for the development of their
child. Participating businesses will be given a
 sticker for their window so families can easily identify these places. Contributions will help cover all of the expenses associated with curating a show, the creation of the website and printing costs of promotional material such as fliers, posters, tote bags and t-shirts.

<p>The Moon Deck can be worked with in a similar fashion to tarot or affirmation cards, yet with more freedom for personal interpretation. Each card has a corresponding write-up in the guidebook to deepen its meaning along with suggested rituals that use yoga, art, meditation, journaling, and other self-care practices. This oracle set can be used in a number of ways: give yourself a reading, give another a reading, use as a daily affirmation, or share with your Moon Circle.<br/><br/></p>

Created to foster sisterhood and healing, this oracle set of cards and guidebook is inspired by the cyclical beauty of the moon and the inherent wisdom of women. It shares experience and insights on growth, intuition, purpose, transformation, practice, and creativity.




The Moon Deck includes:

 44 lovingly illustrated cards carrying potent mantras

 Accompanying guidebook of insights, lessons, and rituals tailored to each card

 Handcrafted wooden box to store your new spellbinding tools

*Every perk option, no matter how many decks, contains a complete Moon Deck (cards + book + box) 











The Moon Deck can be worked with in a similar fashion to tarot or affirmation cards, yet with more freedom for personal interpretation. Each card has a corresponding write-up in the guidebook to deepen its meaning along with suggested rituals that use yoga, art, meditation, journaling, and other self-care practices. This oracle set can be used in a number of ways: give yourself a reading, give another a reading, use as a daily affirmation, or share with your Moon Circle.










  
The rich contents of this deck are already complete and in order to print + produce the final boxset efficiently we want to secure a significant number of pre-orders to make this venture sustainable. 




We're printing the cards locally with Rolling Press in Gowanus, Brooklyn using wind/solar power, recycled paper, and soy-based ink. Each deck is then packaged in a custom, keepsake hand-carved wooden box.  
Our dream is to craft the entire offering consciously, to fill every part of The Moon Deck with love and create a truly specialized high quality product for our collective communities. 









When we hit our goal of $28,000 we can produce right away and you will have your Moon Deck in hand this spring! And since we're shooting for the stars, as we exceed this goal we will be able to build sufficient inventory and extend our reach to a larger community by sharing The Moon Deck at yoga studios, local shops and through our website. 














We are grateful to you for supporting this vision and helping us spread the word about this meaningful project. We need your help to gain momentum and connect with a larger audience. 
Please share this page with anyone you feel could benefit from the inspiring wisdom and art held within The Moon Deck. Feel free to reach out to us directly at info@themoondeck.com if you have any questions, want to learn more or have any ideas about how you or someone you know can help our mission. You can also follow us on our Insta page to stay linked.
If you're a yoga studio or shop owner, or interested in ordering a set of Moon Decks at wholesale cost we'd love to talk! Reach out to info@themoondeck.com and we'll get your order in with this initial bulk production. 









On top of the satisfaction that comes with helping a few ladies realize their dream, pre-ordering your Moon Deck now comes with many perks. 


This is a limited edition first run and is the fastest way to secure your deck.

If you're a local supporter you'll be invited to attend one of our exclusive NYC launch parties where you can pick up your deck, receive personalized readings, purchase signed prints, and celebrate with us in style (stay tuned for dates)

When you purchase any of the bundle perks you receive an amazing friends and family rate for supporting our mission.

<p><b>Summary</b><br/></p>
<p>Two years ago, I spent 10 months teaching at a vocational school
in a rural village in Guizhou, China's most culturally diverse but economically
disadvantaged province. There, I had the great opportunity of giving English
and Leadership classes to a group of 50  girls (aged 15-18) who attended
the school on bursaries to study Chinese ethnic minority culture and art. These
girls all came from very poor farming families and were selected to study at
the school based on their artistic talents. After two semesters of studies at
the school, they were sent to pursue 'internships' at a handmade doll
manufacturing factory in the outskirts of Beijing. </p>
<p>I've recently come to Beijing for an internship myself
and have met up with my old students a few times at their factory. The girls
work 8:30am-5:30pm six days a week and often have to work overtime until late
at night or on their day off. They earn a meagre salary (between $250-400
CAD/month depending on the amount of overtime hours) and are isolated in their
factory compound located 1.5 hours outside the city centre.</p>

</div><div>
<i><br/></i><p>While they're still technically students, the girls
don't have much time or opportunity to learn any skills aside from those needed
to work in this particular factory. </p>
<p>They do, however, have many things they'd like to
learn and dreams they'd like to pursue. Realizing the importance of computer skills, many have saved up and bought laptops; but as they
have never had formal computer training, they only know how to use them for
sending emails, chatting, and watching online videos. They would like to learn
more and make better use of their laptops... how to use basic word processing, researching, and setting up
websites/online stores to sell their crafts, etc. </p>
<p>A handful of the students are also very interested in selling their art and handicrafts but do not have enough capital to buy the materials they need to get started or know-how to sell their products. </p>

<p><i>(Handmade doll by the students at the factory)</i></p>
<p>Prior to leaving China, I'd like to equip these students with a foundation in computer and internet skills, including those which will allow them to sell their art products online. I'd also like to help them purchase art supplies and materials needed to start their mini-art businesses, as well as teach them basic accounting skills and other logistics related to setting up their businesses. I plan to organize two day-long workshops for the students at the end of June with the help of colleagues who have experience with Chinese online selling platforms. </p>
<p>The main objectives of this initiative will be to build the students' capacity and confidence, help kickstart their art businesses, and show them that a factory life is not their only option. </p>
<p><b>What We Need </b></p>
<p>Fundraising goal: $1000 CAD </p>
<p>$500 will be used towards running two day-long capacity
building workshops for the students (transport, food, space, guest speakers). The workshops will include learning developing computer and internet skills, learning how to set up online businesses and its related logistics, money management, and other general leadership skills. </p>
<p>$350 will go to buying art supplies and materials
needed to make their arts and handicraft products</p>
<p>$75 will be used for purchasing materials used for
shipping products (boxes, envelopes, etc.)</p>
<p>$75 will be used for other expenses such as purchasing VPNs for the students to access sites blocked in China/social media, setting up websites to sell the products, etc.</p>
<p>Any money raised beyond the $1000 target will go
towards supporting the students who need but cannot afford things like the
purchasing glasses and having necessary dental work done, or be given to students who wish to continue their studies next year and need support for tuition. </p>
<p><b>What YOU Get</b></p>
<p>The chance to contribute to the empowerment of some
really sweet and talented young women from rural China and good karma. (A few
perks for the first contributions of $20/$30/$50 as well)</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>The young women who take part in this project will receive funds to
purchase art supplies and develop skills to set up their own businesses
selling their handmade ethnic minority products (which will hopefully also result in additional income through
sale of their work). The students will also gain computer skills which will be useful no matter what future career they end up pursuing and help open doors to job opportunities outside the factory. Most importantly, this initiative is meant to help build self-confidence and capacity in young women coming from challenging socio-economic circumstances but who have big dreams for the future.</p>

<p>FUEGO is a 501 (c)3 non-profit organization seeking social justice by providing innovative rehabilitation programs to marginalized youth in Oregon. Our initiatives utilize theater, performance art and movement to allow homeless and incarcerated young people a platform for healing through self expression. We advocate for culturally specific alternative mental health interventions, reduced pharmaceutical treatment and against violent policies implemented in residential treatment facilitates in Oregon.  </p>
<p><strong>Who You Will Impact </strong></p>
<p><span>FUEGO has been working with youth in residential care since 2004 in collaboration with the Oregon Department of Human Services, Catholic Community Services, and other agencies. Focusing on low income Latino, Native American, African American, biracial, and LGBTQ populations, 80% of our clients live on the street, in foster care, residential treatment facilities, or detention facilities. </span></p>
<p><strong>The Forgotten Ones</strong></p>
<p><span>Working with youth living in four residential facilities in Portland, the Forgotten Ones Project provides workshops of mural and face painting, sound healing, dancing, and storytelling to over 120 participants. Innovative expressive arts activities will help young people reduce anxiety, trauma reactivity and depression.</span></p>
<p>The project will culminate in a grand scale performance incorporating these art forms, empowering participants to to discover effective means of communicating after having endured significant trauma, take command of their own healing and showcase their creativity.  </p>
<p><strong>What We Need and How You Can Help </strong></p>
<p><span>We work to empower some of society’s hardest to reach youth. Dedicated staff members, including FUEGO peer mentors - youth who have spent over one year in our programs - need your help to bring this inspiring project to life. </span></p>

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><i>We come from the water, in our mother's womb and on planet Earth… Return and connect with it… ""Sea"" things in a different way, facing on, up, down, above or around this unique art gallery suspended in water… Let yourself be inspired by a beautiful creative world that opens the mind and awakens the observer through the resonance of the water…</i></b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">
</p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><i>AQUART is a cultural aquatic and subaquatic event, organised and promoted by AQUART CONCEPT, whose mission is to promote art, aquatic and subaquatic sports, and the environment. The exhibits are presented in interior pools and in various exterior environments like the Flintkote quarry in Thetford Mines, QC, the St. Lawrence River in Brockville, ON and other places where water is clear. We need your support to produce the event! </i></b></p><p><i>
</i></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><i>AQUART (English), events created by AQUART CONCEPT</i></b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><i><b>Since 2006, a treasure chest of artworks turns the Flintkote site into a submerged museum featuring many talented artists! Each year, more internationally renown names join that top quality exhibition with their one-time and permanent works. </b></i></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><i><b>The presence of many world-famous artists shows the international potential of the event. Let’s mention participants Pascal Lecocq, Jean-Louis Courteau, Dominique Sérafini, David Martel, Anne-Marie Auclair, Jonathan Grant, Martine Cyr, Étienne Saint-Amant, Jo-Ann Wilkins, Olivier Maranda, Charlene Audrey Chouinard, Alain Racine, Gabrielle Bolvari Bergeron, Félix Laflamme, Valmont Cliche, Steve Saint-Pierre, Danielle Perry, Dominique Danvoye, Nathalie Lasselin, Catherine Salisbury, and Kate Kova.</b></i></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><i>The 2015 annual AQUART event proudly features Mr. Mario Cyr</i></b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><i><b>One of the world’s best underwater filmmakers!</b></i></p>

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><i><b>AQUART events and produced and organised by AQUART CONCEPT, a not-for-profit organisation. AQUART events are born and sustained thanks to the investment in time, money, and passion on the part of devoted organisers and volunteers. We created a wonderful collective project that strives to survive and keep transmitting its passion to art, environment as well as aquatic and subaquatic sports aficionados. We urgently need resources in order to establish a permanent team of talents and increase the impact of our actions, while granting stability to those involved with dedication over the years. In 2016, we celebrate our 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary, and would like many of our dreams to come true on the occasion. AQUART is also dedicated to the environment, as we believe creativity, beautiful initiatives and passions are more enjoyable on a healthy planet. </b></i></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><i><b>We would like to grow while giving a voice to artists who share our vision in creating awareness of our environment. Only by waking this inner feeling of belonging to the Earth and to the water that we share, will we evolve in harmony with our environment as a responsible species. Our contribution is in touching the hearts by integrating art in a natural setting and thriving in a creative and respectful world. </b></i></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><i><b>Our funds are used to display submarine art galleries integrated to the environment, each with a nature of their own, and in a radically different context. Organising a subaquatic exhibition, in a natural setting or in a pool, requires special care, not to mention outstanding human and material resources. Setting up and preparing immersed art works and submarine infrastructures, tents, water and land security, support to volunteers, materials, advertising, transportation, and communications are challenges that each year, our volunteers must tackle with very few resources. In order to perpetuate an event of this magnitude, we need your financial support. Please help us as much as you can; our organization and volunteers will take care of the rest. Together, we will fulfill this wonderful mission.  </b></i></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><i><b>Our vision consists in producing exhibitions in Quebec and elsewhere, in working with artists from everywhere in promoting their talents and better cater to their needs through our project. We wish to guide them in their desire to support a research group or charitable foundation of their choice that supports and protects the environment and nature preservation. </b></i></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><i><b>During each annual event, we offer a youth section where renown artists hold workshops. It is essential for us to inspire future generations, as well as planet lovers and decision makers. In 2015, Mrs. Carmen Boudreau will host the Youth section under the theme of the sea and water, featuring the works of the late Frédéric Back. Each drawing identified will be registered in the a project, a visual collection of children’s messages intended for the world’s leaders and decision makers, in order to spark a debate on climate change and biodiversity. These drawings will be at the United Nations Climate Conference to be held in Paris in December. </b></i></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><i><b>AQUART CONCEPT is also a proud supporter of GEERG. After the exhibition, we will give to this group doing research on sharks a contribution based on the number of tickets sold. We are also planning an art auction to support this research group this year. </b></i></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><i><b>Our exhibition projects at the Flintkote quarry, in a pool at « Montréal en lumière » as well as our auctions are all important and require your financial support, as our volunteers have already contributed all that they could afford. The pursuit of our efforts is up to you.  </b></i></p>

Charlene also flirts with new means of expression, such as canvas, paper and computers. Born in Syracuse, New York, she grew up in the beautiful Eastern Townships, in Quebec. She started on an artistic journey at a very young age.

He creates cohesion between his sound-based universe and his psychedelic art.  ""His work has the Fauves' colours, the Cubists' lines and the Surrealists' movement."" (Simon Duplessis, Baz Magazine). With perseverance and invention, he amalgamates abstract elements to create two-dimensional figurative works. Saint-Pierre is always seeking the emergence and sharing of a symbiosis between artists and disciplines. Live creation in various events has quickly become his most sought-for specialty.  In 2006, he became one of the co-founders of the Aquart submarine art galleries. His interest towards environmental installations, In Situ art and large-scale challenges is proven. Sculpture, in stone and recycled materials, is increasingly becoming a dominant channel for his creation. </i></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><i>-----------------------</i></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><i><b>Benoit Guillot (2 of his paintings will be included in the draw on the site the 7-8-9 of august)</b></i></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><i>Themes that guide my creativity are timeless, and revolve around time, absence, void, death, transcendence, feminity and infancy.  In more concrete terms, considering creation and diversity as of equal value, I strive to dig deeper into my favourite themes and with the same enthusiasm, explore the field of possibilities through various media, through painting as well as drawings. To nurture my works, I constantly touch other domains such as travel, 3D animation, even music.

Les évènements AQUART ont vu le jour et se poursuivent grâce aux investissements en temps, en argent et surtout en passion de ses dévoués organisateurs et bénévoles. Nous sommes un merveilleux projet collectif qui aimerait survivre pour perpétuer son action et transmettre ses passions aux adeptes de l’art, de l’environnement et des sports aquatiques et subaquatiques. Nous avons aussi grandement besoin de moyens pour stabiliser une équipe permanente de personnes talentueuses afin d’augmenter l’impact de notre action et garantir une plus grande stabilité pour ceux et celles qui s’y impliquent avec ferveur et dévouement au fil des ans. Nous célèbrerons nos 10 ans en 2016 et nous avons énormément de rêves à réaliser pour tous. AQUART a aussi à cœur l'environnement, car nous croyons que la créativité, les belles initiatives et les passions se réalisent mieux sur une planète en santé! </p><p>Nous voulons prospérer en donnant une voix aux artistes qui partagent cette vision de sensibilisation à notre environnement. Ce n'est qu'en réveillant en nous ce sentiment d'appartenance à la Terre et à l’eau que nous partageons, que nous pouvons évoluer en harmonie avec notre environnement en tant qu'espèce responsable. Toucher les gens droit au cœur par les arts intégrés dans l’élément naturel et grandir dans un monde créatif et respectueux est notre contribution. </p><p>Nous utilisons nos fonds pour présenter des galeries d’art sous-marines, intégrées à l’environnement, dotées d'une nature et dans un contexte naturel complètement différents! La logistique d'exposition sous-marine tant en milieu naturel qu'en piscine requiert une attention particulière, de même que des ressources humaines et matérielles hors norme. La préparation et l’organisation des œuvres immergées et des infrastructures sous-marines, les chapiteaux, la sécurité sous-marine et celle du site d’accueil terrestre, les besoins de soutien aux bénévoles, le matériel général, les frais de publicité, le transport, les communications, sont chaque année des défis que notre équipe doit relever avec très peu de moyens. Pour perpétuer et développer un événement de cette ampleur, nous avons besoin de fonds, nous avons besoin de vous! Aidez-nous chacun dans la mesure où vous le pouvez; notre organisation et nos bénévoles ferons le reste. Ensemble, nous contribuerons à remplir cette belle mission!</p><p>Notre vision consiste à continuer de produire des expositions au Québec, mais aussi ailleurs dans le monde, à travailler de pair avec les artistes de partout pour faire la promotion de leurs talents et écouter plus attentivement leurs besoins à travers notre projet. Nous voulons aussi les guider dans leur désir d'aider un groupe de recherche de leur choix ou une fondation qui soutient, étudie ou protège l'environnement et la conservation de la nature. </p><p>À chaque édition, nous offrons une section jeunesse où des artistes de renom tiennent des ateliers. Il est impératif pour nous d'inspirer les générations futures, les amants de la nature et les décideurs de la planète. Pour l'édition 2015, nous avons Madame Carmen Boudreau qui animera la section jeunesse sur le thème de la mer et de l'eau, tout en présentant les talents du regretté Frédéric Back. Chaque dessin identifié sera enregistré dans un recueil visuel de messages d'enfants visant les dirigeants et décideurs de la planète pour ouvrir un débat sur les problèmes liés aux changements climatiques et la biodiversité. Ces dessins s'en vont à la Conférence des Nations Unies sur le climat à Paris en décembre prochain! </p><p>AQUART CONCEPT est aussi fier supporteur du GEERG. Après l'exposition, nous versons à ce groupe de recherche sur les requins une contribution basée sur les ventes de billets d'entrée. Nous visons cette année à tenir un encan d’œuvres d’art au profit de ce groupe de recherche. </p><p>Nos projets d'exposition à la carrière Flintkote, en piscine lors de « Montréal en lumière » et nos encans sont tous importants et nécessitent votre appui financier, nos bénévoles ayant déjà donné tout ce dont ils étaient capables. Nous pourrons continuer grâce à vous.</p><p><a href=""http://www.geerg.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.geerg.ca/</a></p><p>

La musique, le théâtre et les arts visuels entrent sans cesse en relation dans sa démarche.  Il se crée une cohésion entre ses univers sonores et son art psychédélique. « Dans ses œuvres, il y a la couleur des fauves, la ligne des cubistes et la mouvance des surréalistes » (Simon Duplessis, Magazine Baz). C’est avec acharnement et inventivité qu’il crée des amalgames d’éléments abstraits formant des œuvres bidimensionnelles figuratives. Saint-Pierre cherche constamment à engendrer et à partager la symbiose entre les artistes et les disciplines. La création en direct lors de différents événements est devenue rapidement sa spécialité la plus en demande. En 2006, il est cofondateur d’Aquart, la première galerie sous-marine d’art et il manifeste son intérêt pour les installations environnementales, le In situ et les défis de grandes tailles. La sculpture prend actuellement une part prépondérante dans sa productivité en utilisant la pierre et de multiples matériaux recyclés.</p><p>

Plus concrètement, considérant la création et la diversité sur un pied d'égalité, je cherche autant à approfondir ces thèmes qui me sont chers, qu'à explorer avec la même ferveur le champ des possibles en abordant différents médiums en peinture comme en dessin. Ainsi, pour les nourrir, je tâte constamment d'autres domaines, du voyage jusqu'à l'animation 3D, en passant par la musique. Bref, j'ai le souci très sincère de puiser là où ma curiosité et ma détermination me guident en en abreuvant constamment le terreau de ma création afin d'en restituer les meilleurs fruits possibles.</p><p>

AQUART: Underwater art gallery (English)
We come from the water, in our mother's womb and on planet Earth… Return and connect with it… ""Sea"" things in a different way, facing on, up, down, above or around this unique art gallery suspended in water… Let yourself be inspired by a beautiful creative world that opens the mind and awakens the observer through the resonance of the water…

AQUART is a cultural aquatic and subaquatic event, organised and promoted by AQUART CONCEPT, whose mission is to promote art, aquatic and subaquatic sports, and the environment. The exhibits are presented in interior pools and in various exterior environments like the Flintkote quarry in Thetford Mines, QC, the St. Lawrence River in Brockville, ON and other places where water is clear. We need your support to produce the event! 
AQUART (English), events created by AQUART CONCEPT
Since 2006, a treasure chest of artworks turns the Flintkote site into a submerged museum featuring many talented artists! Each year, more internationally renown names join that top quality exhibition with their one-time and permanent works. 
The presence of many world-famous artists shows the international potential of the event. Let’s mention participants Pascal Lecocq, Jean-Louis Courteau, Dominique Sérafini, David Martel, Anne-Marie Auclair, Jonathan Grant, Martine Cyr, Étienne Saint-Amant, Jo-Ann Wilkins, Olivier Maranda, Charlene Audrey Chouinard, Alain Racine, Gabrielle Bolvari Bergeron, Félix Laflamme, Valmont Cliche, Steve Saint-Pierre, Danielle Perry, Dominique Danvoye, Nathalie Lasselin, Catherine Salisbury, and Kate Kova.
The 2015 annual AQUART event proudly features Mr. Mario Cyr
One of the world’s best underwater filmmakers!

AQUART events and produced and organised by AQUART CONCEPT, a not-for-profit organisation. AQUART events are born and sustained thanks to the investment in time, money, and passion on the part of devoted organisers and volunteers. We created a wonderful collective project that strives to survive and keep transmitting its passion to art, environment as well as aquatic and subaquatic sports aficionados. We urgently need resources in order to establish a permanent team of talents and increase the impact of our actions, while granting stability to those involved with dedication over the years. In 2016, we celebrate our 10th anniversary, and would like many of our dreams to come true on the occasion. AQUART is also dedicated to the environment, as we believe creativity, beautiful initiatives and passions are more enjoyable on a healthy planet. 
We would like to grow while giving a voice to artists who share our vision in creating awareness of our environment. Only by waking this inner feeling of belonging to the Earth and to the water that we share, will we evolve in harmony with our environment as a responsible species. Our contribution is in touching the hearts by integrating art in a natural setting and thriving in a creative and respectful world. 
Our funds are used to display submarine art galleries integrated to the environment, each with a nature of their own, and in a radically different context. Organising a subaquatic exhibition, in a natural setting or in a pool, requires special care, not to mention outstanding human and material resources. Setting up and preparing immersed art works and submarine infrastructures, tents, water and land security, support to volunteers, materials, advertising, transportation, and communications are challenges that each year, our volunteers must tackle with very few resources. In order to perpetuate an event of this magnitude, we need your financial support. Please help us as much as you can; our organization and volunteers will take care of the rest. Together, we will fulfill this wonderful mission.  
Our vision consists in producing exhibitions in Quebec and elsewhere, in working with artists from everywhere in promoting their talents and better cater to their needs through our project. We wish to guide them in their desire to support a research group or charitable foundation of their choice that supports and protects the environment and nature preservation. 
During each annual event, we offer a youth section where renown artists hold workshops. It is essential for us to inspire future generations, as well as planet lovers and decision makers. In 2015, Mrs. Carmen Boudreau will host the Youth section under the theme of the sea and water, featuring the works of the late Frédéric Back. Each drawing identified will be registered in the a project, a visual collection of children’s messages intended for the world’s leaders and decision makers, in order to spark a debate on climate change and biodiversity. These drawings will be at the United Nations Climate Conference to be held in Paris in December. 
AQUART CONCEPT is also a proud supporter of GEERG. After the exhibition, we will give to this group doing research on sharks a contribution based on the number of tickets sold. We are also planning an art auction to support this research group this year. 
Our exhibition projects at the Flintkote quarry, in a pool at « Montréal en lumière » as well as our auctions are all important and require your financial support, as our volunteers have already contributed all that they could afford. The pursuit of our efforts is up to you.

Artists mentioned in the Contests and Visibility Plan:Pascal Lecocqhttp://www.pascal-lecocq.com/wordpress/pascal-lecocq/biographyCharlene Audrey ChouinardCharlene Audrey Chouinard- Founder of the first Aquart event; Director of the 2006 and 2008 annual events; Art Director of the 2015 event. Commercial and Decorative Artist for the past 23 years. Charlene’s passion for visual arts stems from the impulse of her artistic flair.  Inspired by modern and classic motives, as well as her love for life and nature, her creations highlight the gracious transparency of watercolours, the energy of acrylic and the velvety effects of gouache. Charlene also flirts with new means of expression, such as canvas, paper and computers. Born in Syracuse, New York, she grew up in the beautiful Eastern Townships, in Quebec. She started on an artistic journey at a very young age. Strongly inspired by the magnificent landscapes that surrounded her, her passion for art promptly took wing.That same passion took her unto a brilliant creative career. Charlene Audrey is now represented by agent Suzanne Cruise (Suzanne Cruise Creative Services, Inc.) www.cruisecreative.com.  Charlene uses her talents in many ways. Led by her immense passion for art and scuba diving, she founded Canada’s first submarine art gallery, Aquart.For her, it represents the best spiritual therapy possible, and it provides her with decorative art ideas and inspiration for her paintings.---------------------Steve Saint-PierreSteve Saint-Pierre is a multidisciplinary artist invested and involved in Sherbrooke's cultural life since 2001. Music, drama and visual arts interact endlessly in his creative process. He creates cohesion between his sound-based universe and his psychedelic art.  ""His work has the Fauves' colours, the Cubists' lines and the Surrealists' movement."" (Simon Duplessis, Baz Magazine). With perseverance and invention, he amalgamates abstract elements to create two-dimensional figurative works. Saint-Pierre is always seeking the emergence and sharing of a symbiosis between artists and disciplines. Live creation in various events has quickly become his most sought-for specialty.  In 2006, he became one of the co-founders of the Aquart submarine art galleries. His interest towards environmental installations, In Situ art and large-scale challenges is proven. Sculpture, in stone and recycled materials, is increasingly becoming a dominant channel for his creation. -----------------------Benoit Guillot (2 of his paintings will be included in the draw on the site the 7-8-9 of august)Themes that guide my creativity are timeless, and revolve around time, absence, void, death, transcendence, feminity and infancy.  In more concrete terms, considering creation and diversity as of equal value, I strive to dig deeper into my favourite themes and with the same enthusiasm, explore the field of possibilities through various media, through painting as well as drawings. To nurture my works, I constantly touch other domains such as travel, 3D animation, even music. In short, I have this very sincere desire to get inspired by wherever my curiosity and determination will take me, while constantly feeding my creativity in order to reap its best possible fruit.------------------------Genevieve Reesör (1 of her paintings will be included in the draw on the site the 7-8-9 of august)Artist and advocate, Genevieve Reesör produced several exhibitions and accomplishments over the last 20 years. Since the beginnings of M.U.R.I.R.S., a building rejuvenation and social reconciliation project revolving around mural art in Sherbrooke, Québec, Genevieve has been part of the organizational structure, coordinating its works.  In a complementary fashion, she focuses on creation in many professional and community projects of her own, to feed her artistic approach based on the in-depth theme of resilience. *** Perks will be delivered after the August 7-9 event.  These products have to be ordered. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AQUART: Galerie d’art sous-marines (Français)Nous sommes issus de l'eau, celle du ventre maternel comme celle de notre planète. Revenez prendre contact avec elle. ""Eau""-sez voir les choses différemment, sous tous les angles possibles en apesanteur sous l’eau, dans cette galerie unique présentée en suspension sous la surface. Laissez-vous inspirer par ce magnifique monde de création qui ouvre l'esprit et éveille l'observateur par la résonance du milieu aquatique.AQUART est un évènement artistique sous-marin organisé par AQUART CONCEPT, organisme sans but lucratif dont la mission est la promotion de l’art, des sports aquatiques et subaquatiques ainsi que de l'environnement.Ce festival sous-marin est accessible à tous et enchantera particulièrement les amateurs de plongée libre et plongeurs en scaphandre désireux d'ajouter une facette inusitée à leur passion du monde sous-marin.À chaque année depuis 2006, à la deuxième fin de semaine d’août, la carrière Flintkote de Thetford-Mines, accueille la fameuse exposition sous-marine et une collection de plus de 250 œuvres d'art y est présentée au fond des eaux pour le plus grand plaisir des visiteurs équipés d’un masque et de palmes. Des évènements AQUART ont aussi été présentés trois fois en piscine lors de « Montréal en lumières », deux fois dans le Fleuve Saint-Laurent à Brockville, en Ontario et deux fois à la carrière Morrison, près d’Ottawa. Nous avons grand besoin de votre support pour continuer de produire cet événement!
AQUART (français), évènements organisés par AQUART CONCEPTDepuis 2006, une accumulation annuelle d'œuvres d’art fait du site de Flintkote un musée sous-marin réunissant plusieurs talents! Chaque année, de nouveaux artistes internationaux de très grande qualité se joignent à l'exposition avec des œuvres tant événementielles que permanentes.La présence sur place de plusieurs artistes de renommée mondiale démontre le potentiel international de cet événement! Soulignons la participation de Pascal Lecocq, Jean-Louis Courteau, Dominique Sérafini, David Martel, Anne-Marie Auclair, Jonathan Grant, Martine Cyr, Étienne Saint-Amant, Jo-Ann Wilkins, Olivier Maranda, Charlene Audrey Chouinard, Alain Racine, Gabrielle Bolvari Bergeron, Félix Laflamme, Valmont Cliche, Steve Saint-Pierre, Danielle Perry, Dominique Danvoye, Nathalie Lasselin, Catherine Salisbury, Kate Kova.Pour son édition 2015, AQUART est fier de présenter M. Mario CyrUn des meilleurs cinéastes sous-marins au monde!http://www.plongeealpha.com/biographieLes évènements AQUART sont produits et coordonnés par AQUART CONCEPT, un organisme sans but lucratif. Les évènements AQUART ont vu le jour et se poursuivent grâce aux investissements en temps, en argent et surtout en passion de ses dévoués organisateurs et bénévoles. Nous sommes un merveilleux projet collectif qui aimerait survivre pour perpétuer son action et transmettre ses passions aux adeptes de l’art, de l’environnement et des sports aquatiques et subaquatiques. Nous avons aussi grandement besoin de moyens pour stabiliser une équipe permanente de personnes talentueuses afin d’augmenter l’impact de notre action et garantir une plus grande stabilité pour ceux et celles qui s’y impliquent avec ferveur et dévouement au fil des ans. Nous célèbrerons nos 10 ans en 2016 et nous avons énormément de rêves à réaliser pour tous. AQUART a aussi à cœur l'environnement, car nous croyons que la créativité, les belles initiatives et les passions se réalisent mieux sur une planète en santé! Nous voulons prospérer en donnant une voix aux artistes qui partagent cette vision de sensibilisation à notre environnement. Ce n'est qu'en réveillant en nous ce sentiment d'appartenance à la Terre et à l’eau que nous partageons, que nous pouvons évoluer en harmonie avec notre environnement en tant qu'espèce responsable. Toucher les gens droit au cœur par les arts intégrés dans l’élément naturel et grandir dans un monde créatif et respectueux est notre contribution. Nous utilisons nos fonds pour présenter des galeries d’art sous-marines, intégrées à l’environnement, dotées d'une nature et dans un contexte naturel complètement différents! La logistique d'exposition sous-marine tant en milieu naturel qu'en piscine requiert une attention particulière, de même que des ressources humaines et matérielles hors norme. La préparation et l’organisation des œuvres immergées et des infrastructures sous-marines, les chapiteaux, la sécurité sous-marine et celle du site d’accueil terrestre, les besoins de soutien aux bénévoles, le matériel général, les frais de publicité, le transport, les communications, sont chaque année des défis que notre équipe doit relever avec très peu de moyens. Pour perpétuer et développer un événement de cette ampleur, nous avons besoin de fonds, nous avons besoin de vous! Aidez-nous chacun dans la mesure où vous le pouvez; notre organisation et nos bénévoles ferons le reste. Ensemble, nous contribuerons à remplir cette belle mission!Notre vision consiste à continuer de produire des expositions au Québec, mais aussi ailleurs dans le monde, à travailler de pair avec les artistes de partout pour faire la promotion de leurs talents et écouter plus attentivement leurs besoins à travers notre projet. Nous voulons aussi les guider dans leur désir d'aider un groupe de recherche de leur choix ou une fondation qui soutient, étudie ou protège l'environnement et la conservation de la nature. À chaque édition, nous offrons une section jeunesse où des artistes de renom tiennent des ateliers. Il est impératif pour nous d'inspirer les générations futures, les amants de la nature et les décideurs de la planète. Pour l'édition 2015, nous avons Madame Carmen Boudreau qui animera la section jeunesse sur le thème de la mer et de l'eau, tout en présentant les talents du regretté Frédéric Back. Chaque dessin identifié sera enregistré dans un recueil visuel de messages d'enfants visant les dirigeants et décideurs de la planète pour ouvrir un débat sur les problèmes liés aux changements climatiques et la biodiversité. Ces dessins s'en vont à la Conférence des Nations Unies sur le climat à Paris en décembre prochain! AQUART CONCEPT est aussi fier supporteur du GEERG. Après l'exposition, nous versons à ce groupe de recherche sur les requins une contribution basée sur les ventes de billets d'entrée. Nous visons cette année à tenir un encan d’œuvres d’art au profit de ce groupe de recherche. Nos projets d'exposition à la carrière Flintkote, en piscine lors de « Montréal en lumière » et nos encans sont tous importants et nécessitent votre appui financier, nos bénévoles ayant déjà donné tout ce dont ils étaient capables. Nous pourrons continuer grâce à vous.http://www.geerg.ca/

Pascal Lecocqhttp://www.pascal-lecocq.com/wordpress/pascal-lecocq/biographyCharlene Audrey Chouinard-Charlene Audrey Chouinard- Fondatrice du premier évènement Aquart et directrice des éditions 2006 et 2008, directrice artistique de l’édition 2015. Illustratrice commerciale et décorative depuis 23 ans. La passion qui anime Charlene pour son art, la peinture, prend véritablement vie sous l’impulsion de son flair artistique.Inspirée par des motifs modernes et classiques ainsi que par son amour de la vie et de la nature, elle crée ses œuvres en mettant en valeur la gracieuse transparence de l’aquarelle, l’énergie de l’acrylique et les effets veloutés de la gouache. Charlene flirte aussi avec de nouveaux moyens d'expression tels que la toile, le papier ou l'ordinateur. Née à Syracuse dans l’état de New York, elle a grandi dans la magnifique région des Cantons de l’Est, au Québec. Charlene a entrepris son parcours artistique à un très jeune âge. Fortement inspirée par les superbes paysages qui l’entouraient, sa passion pour l’art a rapidement pris son envol.Cette passion l’a justement menée à une brillante carrière créative. Aujourd’hui, Charlene Audrey est représentée par Suzanne Cruise (Suzanne Cruise Creative Services, Inc.) www.cruisecreative.com.  Les talents de Charlene se manifestent dans plusieurs domaines. Menée par sa grande passion pour l’art et pour la plongée sous-marine, elle a fondé la première galerie d’art sous-marine au Canada – Aquart.Cela lui procure la meilleure thérapie spirituelle qui soit tout en lui offrant des modèles de motifs décoratifs ou de l’inspiration pour ses tableaux.
Steve Saint-PierreSteve Saint-Pierre est un artiste pluridisciplinaire qui depuis 2001 s’investit et s’implique activement dans la vie culturelle sherbrookoise. La musique, le théâtre et les arts visuels entrent sans cesse en relation dans sa démarche.  Il se crée une cohésion entre ses univers sonores et son art psychédélique. « Dans ses œuvres, il y a la couleur des fauves, la ligne des cubistes et la mouvance des surréalistes » (Simon Duplessis, Magazine Baz). C’est avec acharnement et inventivité qu’il crée des amalgames d’éléments abstraits formant des œuvres bidimensionnelles figuratives. Saint-Pierre cherche constamment à engendrer et à partager la symbiose entre les artistes et les disciplines. La création en direct lors de différents événements est devenue rapidement sa spécialité la plus en demande. En 2006, il est cofondateur d’Aquart, la première galerie sous-marine d’art et il manifeste son intérêt pour les installations environnementales, le In situ et les défis de grandes tailles. La sculpture prend actuellement une part prépondérante dans sa productivité en utilisant la pierre et de multiples matériaux recyclés.
Benoit Guillot ( 2 Toiles sera tiré sur le site le 7-8-9 août)Les thèmes qui guident ma démarche sont intemporels et s'articulent donc autours du temps, de l'absence, du vide, de la mort, de la transcendance, de la féminité et de l'enfance. Plus concrètement, considérant la création et la diversité sur un pied d'égalité, je cherche autant à approfondir ces thèmes qui me sont chers, qu'à explorer avec la même ferveur le champ des possibles en abordant différents médiums en peinture comme en dessin. Ainsi, pour les nourrir, je tâte constamment d'autres domaines, du voyage jusqu'à l'animation 3D, en passant par la musique. Bref, j'ai le souci très sincère de puiser là où ma curiosité et ma détermination me guident en en abreuvant constamment le terreau de ma création afin d'en restituer les meilleurs fruits possibles.
Geneviève Reesör (1 toile sera tiré sur le site le 7-8-9 août)
Artiste engagée, Geneviève Reesör compte plusieurs expositions et réalisations à son actif depuis 20 ans. Depuis les débuts de M.U.R.I.R.S (murales urbaines à revitalisation d’immeubles et de réconciliation sociale de Sherbrooke), elle œuvre au cœur même de la structure de l’organisme, ainsi qu’à la coordination de ses réalisations. Par complémentarité, elle met l’accent sur la création dans plusieurs projets professionnels et communautaires, qui nourrissent sa propre démarche artistique, axée sur la thématique profonde de la résilience.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Michelle, and I'm the creator of the autobiographical comic accidental pickup lines, which you can find <a href=""http://accidentalpickuplines.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. I like making comics and I like making people laugh, so if you like either comics or laughter, it's a good thing to check out.</p>
<p>In a month, I'm going to London for school (I go to the University of Chicago). While I'm there, I'll continue making comics for you all to read, three times a week. I want you to experience all the cool things that I'll get to see and do while I'm in the UK! But the number of cool things I get to do and you get to read about really depends on my financial resources. </p>
<p>I believe in helping people out, and I also believe in the fun of getting stuff. So if you help me travel to places like Edinburgh, or Stonehenge, or Stratford, then I'm excited to make drawings and comics for you as a thank-you.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Basically, it breaks down like this:</p>
<p>I need money for things like a EuroRail pass so I can travel, and for hotels while I travel, and also for food and books and all those fun things.</p>
<p>What do you get?</p>
<p>I happen to do this drawing thing compulsively, so you get (depending on your perk level) hand-made, one-of-a-kind drawing or comics from me. These can range from a postcard sent from England, to a drawing of your favorite character from English literature, to a completely customizable commissioned comic (alliteration may be included). I want to give you something that you want, so if you want something specific and it's not listed there, contact me and I'll do my best to make it happen for you.</p>
<p>Examples of my work can be found under the gallery tab, on the accidental pickup lines website, or on my tumblr at grifkasketch.tumblr.com.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>You may be thinking, sure, everyone wants to go to traveling in Europe for fun. What kind of real difference will this make to anyone?</p>
<p>Well, besides the awesome perks you'll be getting, you can also feel warm and fuzzy knowing that you've helped an artist succeed in one of their career dreams. Studying in England is a huge step on the way to (I hope) my future career as a professor. I'd like to study the English and European comic scene and write long papers about it, and maybe even a book or two. It's hard to do that from the United States. Ultimately, this is a first step to my goal of solidifying webcomics as an academic discipline.</p>
<p>On a more personal note, my family is from England--my mother was born there--but due to finances I have never been there. I've heard so much about it, and at last I have the chance to experience that part of my family history.</p>

</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><b>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</b></p>
<p>ICE-Axe is a two-channel video installation exploring the inherent bond between fear and trust.  Spectators are invited into a immersive auditory and visual landscape that begins as a choice: to enter a dark narrowing corridor or turn back, a representation of how fear cancels our ability to experience the world around us.  As spectators enter, they are forced to walk atop a projected layer of thin ice, accompanied by axes, chisels and hammers attempting to break through.  Nearing the sounds of inevitable submersion, the hallway tapers down to permit only one person through at a time.  Navigating through an underwater soundscape in near blackness, participants emerge into a large spherical dome, engulfed by a video vista--calm water and an empty boat to safety.  </p><br/><p><b>ABOUT THE FILMMAKER</b></p>
<p>Vanessa Root is a Vermont-based digital media artist whose work utilizes video, performance and installation to address what she calls “the dark night of the soul”; the moments when a person’s ego or false sense of self dies in order for the true self to emerge. The artist’s work explores how shame, guilt, sadness and fear can serve as guiding forces towards trust, acceptance and love.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Through her use of light, shape, perspective and space, she aims to root out the unspoken contracts that keep the true and primal nature submerged. </span>Her works have been showcased at the Museum of Modern Arts and Sciences in Daytona Beach, Florida and the Coca-Cola® website.</p><br/><p><b>BUDGET</b></p><p>TITLE ICE-Axe</p>

ICE-Axe is a two-channel video installation exploring the inherent bond between fear and trust.  Spectators are invited into a immersive auditory and visual landscape that begins as a choice: to enter a dark narrowing corridor or turn back, a representation of how fear cancels our ability to experience the world around us.  As spectators enter, they are forced to walk atop a projected layer of thin ice, accompanied by axes, chisels and hammers attempting to break through.  Nearing the sounds of inevitable submersion, the hallway tapers down to permit only one person through at a time.  Navigating through an underwater soundscape in near blackness, participants emerge into a large spherical dome, engulfed by a video vista--calm water and an empty boat to safety.  ABOUT THE FILMMAKER
Vanessa Root is a Vermont-based digital media artist whose work utilizes video, performance and installation to address what she calls “the dark night of the soul”; the moments when a person’s ego or false sense of self dies in order for the true self to emerge. The artist’s work explores how shame, guilt, sadness and fear can serve as guiding forces towards trust, acceptance and love.Through her use of light, shape, perspective and space, she aims to root out the unspoken contracts that keep the true and primal nature submerged. Her works have been showcased at the Museum of Modern Arts and Sciences in Daytona Beach, Florida and the Coca-Cola® website.BUDGETTITLE ICE-Axe

<p>For 30 years I have worked in both the fields of the wine business and professional photography.

</div></div>","Short Summary Hello all! AMG Pro is a Georgia-based, all-encompassing art group that began in 2010 when a recent high school graduate developed a remarkable concept.  His idea? Create a collaborative group that redefines the idea of ""art""- where various artists could ""bring the arts together"".  A networking group where a musician could join and find band mates, background dancers,a recording studio, and video editors.  A networking group where a writer could join and collaborate with published authors, meet illustrators, and find editors. As an all-encompassing art group, we cater to dancers, photographers, singers, poets, musicians, writers, editors, sculptors, craft-artists, video editors, culinary artists, and so many more.  A network that brings all artists together.  




We began doing monthly spotlight events in 2010, showcasing amazing artists from all over Georgia, which is a tradition that is still active today. The Georgia chapter recently formed an official five member leadership team made up of Stephanie Hornsby, a local Fayetteville author with theatrical experience who has been part of AMG Pro since its early beginnings in 2010; TJ Hornsby, a local Fayetteville musician who has been running the monthly AMG Pro spotlights and recording studio; Claudia Alexander, a Hampton author, editor, and publisher who joined AMG Pro in 2012 ; Johan Levy Jr, a Fayetteville musician and writer who joined AMG Pro in 2013; and finally Dylan Easley, a Smyrna native with writing, musical, and theatrical improvisation experience who joined the art group in 2013. 



The goal of this leadership team is to provide all the tools necessary for local Georgia artists to succeed in their independent industries; we intend to do this first by creating a successful launch year in 2015. Our goals during the official 2015 launch year:
* Find venues for local artists to perform, sell, or promote their art.  
* Continue our free 12 small monthly spotlight events per year.
* Spread the word about AMG Pro and sign up 1000 new artists!
* Update our recording studio and get much needed performance equipment. 
* Put on four to six large-scale events featuring at least five different types of art.
The funds raised through our campaign will help us to make our 2015 launch year a tremendous success. As artists ourselves, we know how difficult breaking into the art and music industry can be.   We are compassionate about our team and about every artist who has come through this remarkable group.



The 2015 launch is just the beginning,  Within the next five years we hope to open up an art-based community center geared towards making every artists' dreams of success a reality.  Your contributions towards our 2015 launch year will help us go from a small-town art group to something even greater.  We are a network of artists helping artists, and we want the world to know that we are here.   What We Need & What You Get The funds raised from this campaign are going to be used strictly to finance our 2015 launch year goals.  The most pressing need is for equipment to expand our music recording capabilities. With our limited resources we are restricted on the scale of our performance events, and we'd like more professional camera equipment for videography in order to prepare for our larger events, like the  AMG Pro CD release concert we have planned for July/August of 2015.
Make sure you check out our perk options which includes: 
* An AMG Pro pen to let people know you contributed to our campaign
*A beautiful piece of hand-crafted jewelry made by one of our groups craft artists
*A ticket to our CD release concert
*An AMG Pro T-shirt
*An AMG Pro CD
*A choice of print (painting or photo) from a AMG Pro Artist
*Personalized Art created just just for you.
*Celeb treatment as a featured artists at one of our events
*Have members from AMG Pro come to your business or party to perform
  The Impact The world needs art.  The ""Artists Helping Artists"" concept is what makes AMG Pro so unique. We need your help  to continue this tradition.  We are rapidly building our network to become linked in with more people and venues, but we need resources to have a bigger impact. 
The group has helped artists from all over the world to meet and collaborate on amazing pieces: helping musicians find gigs, painters find galleries, writers meet editors, and craft-artists find venues. 



Our long-term goal is to open an art-based community center that will be cornerstone to an enterprise like nothing anyone has ever seen.  AMG Pro wants to place importance on art and with your valuable contributions we can make 2015 the beginning of one of the greatest achievements to ever grace the art and music industry.
 
  Risks & Challenges Expanding AMG Pro so that small-town artists can have all the tools necessary to succeed in their field is going to take a lot of work.  AMG Pro has a dedicated staff of artists ready for the challenge, but there are some risks associated with the launch year.  Finding dedicated members to help expand the group, locating affordable venues for our larger events, and expanding from small pizza shop style performances to something on a bigger stage are only a few obstacles the group will face.  Currently there are only a small handful of volunteers who work with AMG Pro, so locating members willing to work the back stage also presents a challenge.


Despite the challenges, with over five hundred supportive members throughout Georgia, AMG Pro is confident that we have  the backing we need to triple our network of artists to make our launch year a success.
 
  Other Ways You Can Help In addition to donating, there are other ways you can help.  Tell the world about AMG Pro to help make some noise!

get there three times and due to different reasons and obstacles, been foiled

all experience challenges in life- and I have overcome some enormous ones- but
what I have learnt from this is you have to do what makes you happy; what makes
you tick and get zingy with excitement. Because when you do- you spread an

from this all sorts of amazing creative things start happening!</p>

<p>Snowboarding
is one of my biggest passions. I love being in the outdoors, the cold air in
the mountains; meeting other people who love similar and different things, and
finding new and interesting phenomenon to challenge myself and learn from.
Guess what?!- Apart from being culturally awesome from every angle- Japan has
one of the biggest amounts of snowfall, of any country in the world and a
culture of snow lovers like no other!</p>
<p>Snowboarding
has taught me skills and reinforced metaphors for living life. It’s a sport
that requires good judgment, honesty, and a realistic appraisal of ones skills,
abilities and expectations. It’s about managing challenges and adapting to your
surroundings, situations and environment. One step in front of the other eeks
further forwards; not only making progress for yourself but also making it
easier for the person who follows. It never fails to amaze me how each day can
be so different, and that when you stop stressing things- it all falls into
place.</p>

<p>It’s
about assessing honestly your mental and physical state and not being so hard
on yourself. It’s risk assessment, judgment calls and planning. You have days
where it all comes together, days that fall apart, days which change from start
to finish and ones which are completely unexpected.</p>

<p>Some
days the ride and the afternoon can be the bonus; just getting up in the
morning and on the chairlift or into the mountains I have achieved. For me it
puts my life in perspective and simplifies it to the basics.</p>

intend to visit Mizuma Art Gallery, Take Ninagawa, Mori Art Museum, Wako Works
of Art, SCAI The Bathhouse, Hara Museum of Contemporary Art to name a few, and other art events along the way. I am so excited
to get to the historic Mecca of Kyoto and to travel to Naoshima- an island
dedicated to contemporary art and sculpture. I predominantly will be
snowboarding in Hakuba and the Nagano prefecture. While in Hakuba I hope to get
to the Saegusa

<p>I
have this analogy that life and individual personalities hark back to when you
are a kid playing in the sandpit. Everyone really wants to be in the sandpit;
included, feeling part of the pack, the team and in confidence. There’s the kid
who’s the megalomaniac dominating all the toys, the kid building amazing crazy
things out of nothing…well sand; there is the kid who’s eating the sand or
putting their own poop in the toys, there is the kid who is terrified of
getting in and who just desperately want to be part of the fun but cant figure
out how…</p>
<p>As
we get older, we get bigger and more concerned with how others perceive us in
the sandpit, but the basics are the same. Everyone wants to be in the pack.</p>
<p>I
find solace in this funny image especially when encountering conflict- because
really it all comes down to fear and power. A lot of the time it’s not necessarily
about the ‘thing’ or the ‘problem’ its much bigger; sometimes it’s just about
wanting someone to ‘hear’ us and let us climb back into the sandpit.</p>

people and make real rather than virtual connections, I hope to encounter and
create opportunities for myself to exhibit in Japan, and find Japanese artists
who are interested in exhibiting with me.</span></p>

<h4><b>What’s your background Miss Moena?</b></h4>
<p>My Art and Design background is Industrial and
Textile Design. I work in a mesh of industrial materials and embellished
application. </p>
<p>I enjoy juxtaposing mediums and techniques. My
illustration &amp; topographic style is dense, detailed and almost cartographic
in nature. Themes &amp; subjects drawing inspiration from Japan, popular culture,
my environment and experiences.</p>
<p>My process is playful and dynamic. Sketching,
collating, modeling and digital rendering moves through to tighter finished and
polished graphic design, painting, bronze sculpture and etched glasswork.</p>

<p></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I seek the freedom and responsibility to create and
grow within a culture that values teamwork, creativity, best practice,

other artists to share, grow and develop by participating in my adventure.</span></p>

<h4><b>Japan and Moena…</b></h4>
<p></p>
<p>I
have been crazy about all things Japanese since I can remember.  My Grandmothers collected Japanese
artifacts, art, netsuke (small bone carvings) and furniture, and my Mother, Grandmother
and her Mother loved all things Oriental. I studied Japanese at school and
continued classes after university- I have a Bachelor of Design (Honors)-
Textiles with 3 completed years of Industrial Design; my projects and work
paying homage to Japanese aesthetics and practices.</p>
<p>I
cook Japanese cuisine, am inspired, influenced and intrigued by historical and
modern Japanese art, literature, culture &amp; design and even went through the
relevant ‘Hello Kitty’ stage! &amp; then there is the snow!!......</p>
<p>I
am tattooed with my own artwork, which is influenced by Japanese woodcuts.</p>
<p>Although,
none of this compares to really experiencing a culture first hand.</p><p></p><p>                  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/934809/files/20141016012814-VultureCollage.jpg?1413448094"" src="""" style=""width: 479.64036697247707px; height: 572px;""/></p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Alongside
everything arty &amp; Japanese, I am passionate about motorbikes &amp;
snowboarding. Both are sports with a high level of camaraderie and attract a
like-minded set of individuals who live life to the fullest, are go getting
adventurers. When motorbiking at speed, to make smooth tight turns, you want to
be rolling lightly on the accelerator with your eyes at the horizon’s vanishing
point, not anywhere near the brake or looking down… creative projects seem to
benefit in the same way.</span><br/></p>
<p>Geographically New Zealand and
Japan are very similar- and both have an ardent crew of snow mad powder dogs,
who travel seasonally between both countries. </p>
<p>This love of snow binds us with
a common tie (or rope tow as the case may be)- it’s a perfect way to meet
people on the same wavelength.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/934813/files/20141016013238-2.png?1413448358"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h4><b>Goals and intentions?</b></h4>
<p></p>
<p>This adventure is the fulfillment of a
personal dream- but hopefully the beginning of something bigger as well. I am
sealing everything up in New Zealand to leave unhindered by ties, commitments
or schedule concerns- I am off with wanderlust and going where my heart
dictates.</p>
<p>Travelling for me is about sharing,
connecting, inspiring, being motivated, networking, creating, supporting and
living. Its up, down, in-between, and all types of sideways- and its FRESH!</p>
<p>While travelling, I will be researching
different artistic techniques- developing my knowledge of sculpture, glasswork
and illustration in particular, while accumulating experiences with people of a
similar creative orientation.</p><p><br/></p>

<p><i>                          My favorite place in NZ- Lake Ohau,
Twizel, South Island</i></p>
<p>A year ago my good friend Jonny
shared a story about an Ant and a sugar cube, which has given me much joy in
remembering and helped me when I think I have lost track…</p>
<p>Miss Ant was going about her
business when low and behold a Giant cube of sugar dropped in her track.
‘Bloody hell!’ exclaimed Ant “What am I to do? This thing has blocked my
path!!”. Miss Ant was fond of sugar and so she thought “Ok, fastest way, and
tastiest is for me to munch straight through!”, so off she started, little
nibble, by little nibble going straight through the center… but this process
was slow, and she became full fast, and she was lonely- no-one else there to
help her, she had burrowed into the dark alone. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">With only her thoughts as
company and no track of time in the dark, she stopped. This path was not
working; it didn’t feel good. Yes, it may be the fastest way through, she
thought, but its no fun at all! </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Out she backed from the tunnel
and re grouped her thoughts. It would be longer going around the cube but she
had tried option one, so no harm in trying option two! </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Off she embarked. She felt good
in the sun, encountering different things along her route around the perimeter.
She could stop and nibble off the side of the cube when she needed, and as she
progressed she met other ants. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">They shared their stories and
experiences, laughed and took time out to hear each other’s point of view. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">As she came around to her original
path, she reflected on her adventure. What had seemed like a problem had
instigated so many other interesting circumstances. How she had grown and
learnt from the new situations she had undertaken! </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Keep your eye on the prize,
change your mind, try new tactics and have fun along the way and more often
than not, what you think might be a roadblock, turns into an enriching
diversion.</span></p>

route- whatever convoluted way it takes you!</p>

<p>Media networks do have their
uses- especially when it comes to connecting people internationally; and I
believe this project can benefit from both traditional face-to-face
communication, and digital.</p>
<p>Skype is a terrific tool for
video calling. Artists invited to exhibit may not be able to afford to be at
the show in person, but could be invited to participate in ‘real time’ through
video stations set up at the show, allowing them to interact in real-time. </p>

</div></div>","MOENA IS OFF TO JAPAN..

Hi! My name is Alexandra
Murcott and I create art under the pseudonym Moena Moxham.

I am a Surface Designer based in Wellington, New Zealand.I forge bronze sculptures, etch glass, illustrate and draw things!I
was excited to come across the crowd-funding website indiegogo.com because it
gives me the opportunity to show my art to a wider audience while raising money
from selling my art to fund my next venture. To follow my dream, I’m going to
need a bit of extra help… but keep reading- I think you may want to join the
ride…
‘Keep Your Head in the Clouds’  - Hand cut
and etched glass vase
It
has been a dream of mine for many years to travel to Japan and experience a
culture that has inspired and informed my life and work. I have attempted to
get there three times and due to different reasons and obstacles, been foiled
each time. Four years ago I focused on what I needed in order to be able to
achieve this target, and began to prioritize my goals and aspirations. From
then on I have been preparing myself mentally and physically to make this goal
present in reality… the time is now!

I
am crowd funding to travel to Japan over the 2014/15 snow season and beyond! I
have packed up everything in New Zealand to embark on an Art/ snow journey of a
lifetime, leaving NZ in January 2015. I am seeking new experiences in every shape and form; sparking inspiration
for my next collection of work. I would love to find places to exhibit in
Japan. This is all while meeting other people who adore life and adventure as
much as I do!

          ‘Out of the Dog Box’                         'Regina'                             ‘Cluster F&%#K’
We
all experience challenges in life- and I have overcome some enormous ones- but
what I have learnt from this is you have to do what makes you happy; what makes
you tick and get zingy with excitement. Because when you do- you spread an
energy that infects everyone around you to get up and do what they love too;
from this all sorts of amazing creative things start happening!
'Love Cuts Deep’ – bronze & glass(I
want to make these x500 to scale! Piercing the land so that people look up to
them…)
Snowboarding
is one of my biggest passions. I love being in the outdoors, the cold air in
the mountains; meeting other people who love similar and different things, and
finding new and interesting phenomenon to challenge myself and learn from.
Guess what?!- Apart from being culturally awesome from every angle- Japan has
one of the biggest amounts of snowfall, of any country in the world and a
culture of snow lovers like no other!
Snowboarding
has taught me skills and reinforced metaphors for living life. It’s a sport
that requires good judgment, honesty, and a realistic appraisal of ones skills,
abilities and expectations. It’s about managing challenges and adapting to your
surroundings, situations and environment. One step in front of the other eeks
further forwards; not only making progress for yourself but also making it
easier for the person who follows. It never fails to amaze me how each day can
be so different, and that when you stop stressing things- it all falls into
place.

Summit of Mt Ruapehu- Crater Lake August
2014
It’s
about assessing honestly your mental and physical state and not being so hard
on yourself. It’s risk assessment, judgment calls and planning. You have days
where it all comes together, days that fall apart, days which change from start
to finish and ones which are completely unexpected.

Some
days the ride and the afternoon can be the bonus; just getting up in the
morning and on the chairlift or into the mountains I have achieved. For me it
puts my life in perspective and simplifies it to the basics.
‘Keep Your Head in the Clouds’
I
love getting up, out and doing things. In a society that is increasingly dominated
with messages and images about how we should look, I want to reinforce how
amazing we all are when our healthy bodies can go out and DO. Check out some of
my latest adventures here on my BLOG
I am going to hike
new mountains, wakeboard new waters, ride new slopes, bathe on new beaches
& motor new roads while taking on new challenges with gusto!
'Who’s Left Holding the Baby’      ‘Semi Permanent’                 ‘Hangin in Da Wood’
While in Tokyo I
intend to visit Mizuma Art Gallery, Take Ninagawa, Mori Art Museum, Wako Works
of Art, SCAI The Bathhouse, Hara Museum of Contemporary Art to name a few, and other art events along the way. I am so excited
to get to the historic Mecca of Kyoto and to travel to Naoshima- an island
dedicated to contemporary art and sculpture. I predominantly will be
snowboarding in Hakuba and the Nagano prefecture. While in Hakuba I hope to get
to the Saegusa
Art Gallery which has over 100 oil and water paintings focusing on the Hakuba
landscape. The Hakuba Museum of Art is also on my get to list.

On
the 19th of Sept 2013, I held an exhibition at my studio in
Wellington, New Zealand- if I return to New Zealand, I aim to use this space,
or another suitable at home or overseas to invite artists form Japan and the
world to exhibit with me. On the 28th of November 2014 I am part of
a sculpture exhibition with the New Zealand Academy of Fine Arts and the Life
Education Trust and will use this event to explore other opportunities.
                              
                                             ‘Indelible’ - Hand painted wooden vase
Our
world is becoming increasingly reliant on social media to form relationships,
friendships and connections. Nothing compares to really being there. I like to
get out there and be amongst the real deal!! You can’t get snow in your face
and your hair blown back sitting at your computer!

‘Monsters in my Machina’ 
I
have this analogy that life and individual personalities hark back to when you
are a kid playing in the sandpit. Everyone really wants to be in the sandpit;
included, feeling part of the pack, the team and in confidence. There’s the kid
who’s the megalomaniac dominating all the toys, the kid building amazing crazy
things out of nothing…well sand; there is the kid who’s eating the sand or
putting their own poop in the toys, there is the kid who is terrified of
getting in and who just desperately want to be part of the fun but cant figure
out how…
As
we get older, we get bigger and more concerned with how others perceive us in
the sandpit, but the basics are the same. Everyone wants to be in the pack.
I
find solace in this funny image especially when encountering conflict- because
really it all comes down to fear and power. A lot of the time it’s not necessarily
about the ‘thing’ or the ‘problem’ its much bigger; sometimes it’s just about
wanting someone to ‘hear’ us and let us climb back into the sandpit.


‘Creative Heart’
You
have a different grasp on life when you have experienced a spectrum; I crave
variation and am fascinated by turning life’s curves into visual manifestations.
For me, life is about pushing the envelope a little further and redefining my limits.Overcoming
adversity erases the rationality away from turning your whole world upside
down. Not to say that this process has not been absolutely terrifying at stages!
- Second guessing and reflection, re-evaluation and brain storming conversations
with friends makes what you’re trying to achieve relevant, on track and fun!                                                                      '180 km/hr Monarch Butterfly'MISSION: I
am travelling to Japan and beyond to soak up as much inspiration, art, culture,
music, and snow missions as one person can put in a trip! While away, I aim to make connections with like-minded artists.
Using the adventure, and my passion for snowboarding and the outdoors to meet
people and make real rather than virtual connections, I hope to encounter and
create opportunities for myself to exhibit in Japan, and find Japanese artists
who are interested in exhibiting with me.
The
trip will be inspiration for my next body of work.
Long-term I
will explore turning this into a biennial event, alternating between NZ and
Japan.
AIM: To travel with wanderlust. It has been a dream of mine to exhibit my
art in Japan- I want to share my passion with others and create something
bigger than myself.
OBJECTIVE: To
encourage other people to get out there, take risks to follow their dreams,
live a healthy lifestyle and to spread the love and laughter. By sharing my
enthusiasm for life & enthusiasm for snow and adventure I hope to encourage
others to truly follow their passions.
WHO BENEFITS?: Myself
and associated project supporters, friends, and artists are the immediate
beneficiaries, both in Wellington and overseas. This network will grow and
expand through this project; initially with exposure through indiegogo.com,
then through the trip to Japan, Europe and following on to the exhibition post
adventure. The quantifiable amount of people associated is going to snowball!

INTENDED AUDIENCE: Anyone
interested in art, visual culture, adventure, travel, Japan/ NZ..living life
BIG
HOW DOES THIS PROJECT RAISE AWARENESS
OF JAPAN/ NZ/ ART?: This
project raises awareness in visual culture by linking creative artists in
different countries, creating opportunities for cultural exchange and
development.
‘Sometimes the Day is Just Two Sizes Too Small’ -  Guash, watercolor,
mixed media


What’s your background Miss Moena?
My Art and Design background is Industrial and
Textile Design. I work in a mesh of industrial materials and embellished
application. 
I enjoy juxtaposing mediums and techniques. My
illustration & topographic style is dense, detailed and almost cartographic
in nature. Themes & subjects drawing inspiration from Japan, popular culture,
my environment and experiences.
My process is playful and dynamic. Sketching,
collating, modeling and digital rendering moves through to tighter finished and
polished graphic design, painting, bronze sculpture and etched glasswork.
    ‘Keep Your Head in the Clouds’                  Moxham ‘Disappearing Line’ Exhibition
I embrace change, improvise & adapt, I expand
on my skills by working with new people in exciting environments- this trip is
the next step in my journey as a person and as an artist.
I seek the freedom and responsibility to create and
grow within a culture that values teamwork, creativity, best practice,
integrity and innovation. I am focused on excellence and dedicated to seeking
out new, challenging experiences. By making this trip to Japan I am fulfilling
a lifelong dream while making something bigger than myself- an opportunity for
other artists to share, grow and develop by participating in my adventure.
“Those who
danced were thought to be quite insane by those who could not hear the
music"" ANON
                       ‘Suspension’ 

Japan and Moena…

I
have been crazy about all things Japanese since I can remember.  My Grandmothers collected Japanese
artifacts, art, netsuke (small bone carvings) and furniture, and my Mother, Grandmother
and her Mother loved all things Oriental. I studied Japanese at school and
continued classes after university- I have a Bachelor of Design (Honors)-
Textiles with 3 completed years of Industrial Design; my projects and work
paying homage to Japanese aesthetics and practices.
I
cook Japanese cuisine, am inspired, influenced and intrigued by historical and
modern Japanese art, literature, culture & design and even went through the
relevant ‘Hello Kitty’ stage! & then there is the snow!!......
I
am tattooed with my own artwork, which is influenced by Japanese woodcuts.
Although,
none of this compares to really experiencing a culture first hand.                  

           ‘Vulture Kisses’- digital, screen-printed and embroidered textile
project.
Alongside
everything arty & Japanese, I am passionate about motorbikes &
snowboarding. Both are sports with a high level of camaraderie and attract a
like-minded set of individuals who live life to the fullest, are go getting
adventurers. When motorbiking at speed, to make smooth tight turns, you want to
be rolling lightly on the accelerator with your eyes at the horizon’s vanishing
point, not anywhere near the brake or looking down… creative projects seem to
benefit in the same way.
Geographically New Zealand and
Japan are very similar- and both have an ardent crew of snow mad powder dogs,
who travel seasonally between both countries. 
This love of snow binds us with
a common tie (or rope tow as the case may be)- it’s a perfect way to meet
people on the same wavelength.


Goals and intentions?

This adventure is the fulfillment of a
personal dream- but hopefully the beginning of something bigger as well. I am
sealing everything up in New Zealand to leave unhindered by ties, commitments
or schedule concerns- I am off with wanderlust and going where my heart
dictates.
Travelling for me is about sharing,
connecting, inspiring, being motivated, networking, creating, supporting and
living. Its up, down, in-between, and all types of sideways- and its FRESH!
While travelling, I will be researching
different artistic techniques- developing my knowledge of sculpture, glasswork
and illustration in particular, while accumulating experiences with people of a
similar creative orientation.

 Building Relationships
Face-to-face:

Communication in the modern
world is becoming increasingly digital, through technology, media, social
networks and profiles. We have less ‘genuine’ contact and are becoming more dependent
on using these media outlets to make friendships or business connections.
  
                                                Skydiving Wairarapa, New Zealand
I like the good ol’ fashioned
technique of meeting face to face! You engage on a direct, human and genuine
plane; leave room for happy coincidence, change of plans, hiccups and an
organic development of meeting others through experiences and participation.
Rather than being behind a computer screen, cushioned by a screened &
edited digital representation of yourself.

 

                          My favorite place in NZ- Lake Ohau,
Twizel, South Island
A year ago my good friend Jonny
shared a story about an Ant and a sugar cube, which has given me much joy in
remembering and helped me when I think I have lost track…
Miss Ant was going about her
business when low and behold a Giant cube of sugar dropped in her track.
‘Bloody hell!’ exclaimed Ant “What am I to do? This thing has blocked my
path!!”. Miss Ant was fond of sugar and so she thought “Ok, fastest way, and
tastiest is for me to munch straight through!”, so off she started, little
nibble, by little nibble going straight through the center… but this process
was slow, and she became full fast, and she was lonely- no-one else there to
help her, she had burrowed into the dark alone. With only her thoughts as
company and no track of time in the dark, she stopped. This path was not
working; it didn’t feel good. Yes, it may be the fastest way through, she
thought, but its no fun at all! Out she backed from the tunnel
and re grouped her thoughts. It would be longer going around the cube but she
had tried option one, so no harm in trying option two! Off she embarked. She felt good
in the sun, encountering different things along her route around the perimeter.
She could stop and nibble off the side of the cube when she needed, and as she
progressed she met other ants. They shared their stories and
experiences, laughed and took time out to hear each other’s point of view. As she came around to her original
path, she reflected on her adventure. What had seemed like a problem had
instigated so many other interesting circumstances. How she had grown and
learnt from the new situations she had undertaken! Keep your eye on the prize,
change your mind, try new tactics and have fun along the way and more often
than not, what you think might be a roadblock, turns into an enriching
diversion.
There is no right or wrong
route- whatever convoluted way it takes you!




                                                                            ‘Meld’ 
Media networks do have their
uses- especially when it comes to connecting people internationally; and I
believe this project can benefit from both traditional face-to-face
communication, and digital.
Skype is a terrific tool for
video calling. Artists invited to exhibit may not be able to afford to be at
the show in person, but could be invited to participate in ‘real time’ through
video stations set up at the show, allowing them to interact in real-time. 
Regular updates on my travels
will occur, using my BLOG rather than social media to keep everyone up to date with how
the project is progressing.

Pitch in! Why should I help you
fundraise?
Using indiegogo.com appealed to me because of
the ‘perk’ based funding. I like trading! Indiegogo.com lets me sell my art to
raise money towards a goal, while spreading the word internationally about my
idea.
Attitude is everything. With a smile,
good ideas and planning, excellent execution, lots of laughter, some cachinga
and a little luck- this project is gunna fly!
This is not just about funding: Indiegogo is an international platform, with people worldwide. 
If you are in Japan, or Europe and know someone might be interested in
this project- please link them in- I would love to get connected!

<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
<p>My name is Mynzah and in November of 2008 I experienced a spontaneous Kundalini awakening.  I have utilized this gift of Grace to express in various ways our collective union of one, as well as our Divine connection with the all the Universe and that which is seen and unseen.</p>
<p>Following the Kundalini awakening, one of the ways that I have expressed the Divine truth has been through digital art.  I have recently been presented an opportunity to display my art in a gallery in Arizona.  This will be the first time that my art has be in a gallery and I am honored for this opportunity.</p>
<p>For many years I gave my art away until several people approached me about my art being available for sale in a gallery.  At the time, I wasn’t comfortable selling my art, not because I didn’t feel it was good enough but because I wanted everyone to have access to it regardless of their social economic status, and I still feel this way.  One day while in meditation, I received guidance that it was now appropriate for me to make my art available for purchase. I resisted but eventually became aware that a reciprocal exchange of energy was necessary and healthy for all involved.</p>
<p>In 2010, I opened a venue for my art through Fine Art America, yet didn’t upload any of my art until 2011.  It wasn’t until the beginning of 2012 that I actually made my uploaded art available for purchase.  Now, I have an opportunity to present my art in an art gallery.</p>
<h2><strong>Why Indiegogo?</strong></h2>
<p>I am utilizing this platform (indiegogo), to raise the money necessary to establish my art in this gallery and potentially in other galleries both locally and abroad.  To present my art to the public in a gallery format requires that I print and frame my art.   This is different for me because through Fine Art America, printing and framing are done for me at the time of each purchase through them.  Therefore, I must purchase my prints and framing, this is one reason I have come here for assistance with making my art available for public display in a gallery.</p>
<h2><strong>Goals for this show</strong></h2>
<p>My goal for displaying my art in this gallery is to reach as many as possible that ordinarily would not view my art online.  My intention is to establish my art locally and then abroad in the physical.</p>
<p>The purchasing of my art assists me in recouping my costs and allows me to re-invest in my creative expression and to provide more to the public.</p>
<p>I’m not a formally trained artist and my motivation for making art is not money.  I make art to assist in the awakening of the collective consciousness and also because I enjoy it very much and others appreciate it as well.  Placing my art in a gallery is a very big step for me and one that I have shunned for some time but have now come to a place of acceptance.  I now see the benefits for all by having my art available for display in the physical rather than merely online. </p>
<p>To view my art online is one thing but to see it in the physical is entirely different experience.  I came to this realization the first time I printed and framed my first art piece and witnessed the extremes for myself.  Printed and framed, my art took on an entirely different dynamic for me and others.  This is the reason for the importance to present my art in the physical to the public.  True appreciation of the art I create comes from viewing it in physical form, therefore I am reaching out to manifest it into the physical reality with your assistance and this show.</p>

</div></div>","Introduction
My name is Mynzah and in November of 2008 I experienced a spontaneous Kundalini awakening.  I have utilized this gift of Grace to express in various ways our collective union of one, as well as our Divine connection with the all the Universe and that which is seen and unseen.
Following the Kundalini awakening, one of the ways that I have expressed the Divine truth has been through digital art.  I have recently been presented an opportunity to display my art in a gallery in Arizona.  This will be the first time that my art has be in a gallery and I am honored for this opportunity.
For many years I gave my art away until several people approached me about my art being available for sale in a gallery.  At the time, I wasn’t comfortable selling my art, not because I didn’t feel it was good enough but because I wanted everyone to have access to it regardless of their social economic status, and I still feel this way.  One day while in meditation, I received guidance that it was now appropriate for me to make my art available for purchase. I resisted but eventually became aware that a reciprocal exchange of energy was necessary and healthy for all involved.
In 2010, I opened a venue for my art through Fine Art America, yet didn’t upload any of my art until 2011.  It wasn’t until the beginning of 2012 that I actually made my uploaded art available for purchase.  Now, I have an opportunity to present my art in an art gallery.
Why Indiegogo?
I am utilizing this platform (indiegogo), to raise the money necessary to establish my art in this gallery and potentially in other galleries both locally and abroad.  To present my art to the public in a gallery format requires that I print and frame my art.   This is different for me because through Fine Art America, printing and framing are done for me at the time of each purchase through them.  Therefore, I must purchase my prints and framing, this is one reason I have come here for assistance with making my art available for public display in a gallery.
Goals for this show
My goal for displaying my art in this gallery is to reach as many as possible that ordinarily would not view my art online.  My intention is to establish my art locally and then abroad in the physical.
The purchasing of my art assists me in recouping my costs and allows me to re-invest in my creative expression and to provide more to the public.
I’m not a formally trained artist and my motivation for making art is not money.  I make art to assist in the awakening of the collective consciousness and also because I enjoy it very much and others appreciate it as well.  Placing my art in a gallery is a very big step for me and one that I have shunned for some time but have now come to a place of acceptance.  I now see the benefits for all by having my art available for display in the physical rather than merely online. 
To view my art online is one thing but to see it in the physical is entirely different experience.  I came to this realization the first time I printed and framed my first art piece and witnessed the extremes for myself.  Printed and framed, my art took on an entirely different dynamic for me and others.  This is the reason for the importance to present my art in the physical to the public.  True appreciation of the art I create comes from viewing it in physical form, therefore I am reaching out to manifest it into the physical reality with your assistance and this show.
Costs
All money raised through Indiegogo goes towards the costs of the show below:

Prints of Art for show
Framing of Art
Crating and shipping the work
Insurance
Transportation
Accommodations
Labeling
Studio supplies (lamination, materials, paper, ink etc)

Since I’m setting up my own show and managing it, this is entirely different than if I were just sending the work to a gallery. A gallery would normally take care of the logistics, taxes, venue, sales, PR and business development. However, in my case, the entire cost is my responsiblity.

<p>I am not a household name, except among some select households of national and international art collectors in the know. What they know is that I am a career committed professional visual artist who for the past fifty years has continued to evolve.  My sculptures are making their debut in public places and will introduce many more people to my ever-expanding body of work. But the readers of this page will get to know my creative mind from a different perspective as contributors to my first novel.</p>
<p>The book portrays the life of a fictional female contemporary artist living and working in New York City.  Set against a global backdrop of haute couture, the story is a mystery that includes elements of romance, sex, greed, and murderous mayhem among the elite that collect and treasure art masterpieces, usually by buying and selling, but ultimately by whatever means necessary.  Skullduggery, betrayal, and unconditional love result, and create a powerful tale that is a perfect case of art mimicking life.</p>
<p>My maturity as a painter and sculptor has developed through observation.  It is this same observation that is needed to spin the captivating tale of the real life drama in the art world. Now, I am raising funds to pay the costs of completing the manuscript for my latest creation, art as a novel. This is a visual concept morphing into the written word. </p>
<p>My goal is to raise $50,000. By contributing to this project, you will contribute to the creative process that ultimately renders the passion of art, the business of art, and yes, art imagery, in the form of a book. Words and images excerpted from the novel will be used as themes in future gallery and museum exhibitions and in book readings that transform concept into performance.</p>
<p>I consider community involvement to be a key element in my work. Especially in public art, collaboration and input help me to create the kind of work that people relate to and enjoy the most. I am currently working on a giant, landmark sculpture that will be exhibited in suburban Miami, Florida, and it has already generated excitement and anticipation in the community because the community is intimately involved in the creative process.</p>
<p>My novel is in many ways a work of public art. It is an art concept rendered as a novel. Your collaborative contributions will help me to produce the best, most enjoyable art novel I can.</p>
<p>Be my patron and join me in this exciting new effort.  <strong><em>ART AS A NOVEL REPRESENTS COLLECTIVE IMAGINATION!   LET'S GET STARTED!  MAKE SOME NOISE AND REMEMBER TO USE THE INDIEGOGO SHARE TOOLS! </em></strong> If you cannot contribute funds, please contribute energy by spreading the word on all your social networks!</p>

<p><br/> This year will extend the Festival to the city of Arequipa, known as the white city. Arequipa is one of the major cities of the southern highlands of Peru, with a great artistic tradition and culture where artists lately are developing and strengthening multidisciplinary art initiatives.

About the book: ""With
the help of the wonderful bird Dunuru, the brothers and sisters Binah, Namulé,
and Hethu meet Dah, an old herbalist from the tribe of the Garinagu, who lives
in the middle of the jungle. Like magic they fly into the past and experience
the history of their people originating from Africa.""
The book is a collaborative effort as my mother Ingrid, also an artist 
and musician, wrote the text along with my brother Ibo. My father Pen 
and brother Beni assists me as well with the storyboard of the book. I 
did the illustrations and the design.My motivation for the book is to inspire a new generation of Belizean youth to learn and connect with the rich heritage and journey of the Garinagu and also to introduce this culture to all the people in the world.My inspiration for the illustrations was of course Belize itself. I was born in Belize, migrated to Germany in 1990 with my family. Growing up in Germany allowed me to see the contrast, the beauty, the uniqueness of Belize.But I always had a connection to Belize: the paintings of my father, the art of my mother, our music (we have a family band playing Punta Rock), the food (we mostly cooked Rice & Beans, Hudut and had Johnny cakes and Powder buns and Cassava bread), pictures, books and of course our vacations in Belize.The target audience are first of all children and of course adults (parents and teachers) who will read the book for the younger ones.

Bonjour
à tous, moi c'est Ryan, j'ai 18 ans, je suis étudiant en droit à
tours, et je fais partie du comité d'organisation du Téléthon sur
la commune de Fondettes.<br/>Comme chaque année à Fondettes, de
nombreuses manifestations et activités sont proposées le weekend du
Téléthon afin de récupérer une somme d'argent qui est entièrement
reversée au Téléthon.</p>
<p>
Pour
cette occasion si particulière, nous organisons pour la première
fois un LOTO. Cependant, nous n'avons aucun fond d'investissement.
Nous n'avons donc pas d'apport d'argent qui nous permettrait l'achat
des lots que nous voulons proposer lors de ce LOTO. Nous nous sommes
d'abord tourné vers la générosité des magasins et grandes
enseignes qui, pour la majorité, n'ont pas répondu favorablement à
nos demandes de lots.</p>
<p>
Et
c'est maintenant vers vous et vers votre générosité que nous nous
tournons. En effet nous avons besoin de vous et des possibles dons
que vous pourrez réaliser dans le but de nous aider à concrétiser
le projet. </p>
<p>
Tout
vos dons serviront à acheter de magnifiques lots qu'il sera possible
de gagner lors de ce LOTO. Ainsi ces lots serviront à amener le
maximum de personnes au LOTO et le bénéfice n'en sera que plus
grand, et autant le bénéfice financier que le bénéfice morale
puisque je vous le rappelle, tous l'argent récolté lors du LOTO
sera reversé au Téléthon qui je le penses est une cause nationale
à laquelle nous nous devons d'y prendre part. Et si jamais les dons
dépassent nos espérances, le surplus sera évidemment reversé
entièrement au Téléthon.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">A Magic Theater and Shop in New Albany IN located only 10 minutes from downtown Louisville KY</h3>
<p>My name is Brent Braun, and for the last 20 years, I have been <strong>performing</strong>, creating, selling and working behind the scenes to create magic for some of the top magicians in the world. I've <strong>created</strong> magic that has been seen by millions on Americans Got Talent, Netflix, Penn &amp; Teller Fool Us, and even created the trick that Richard Jones used to win Britain's Got Talent. </p>
<p>I truly <strong>believe</strong> that magic has the ability to change and <strong>inspire</strong> people from young to old. I've been lucky enough to be able to travel the world and see the <strong>positive</strong> impact magic can have on people's lives.  Now I'm hoping to bring that magic to a small intimate space in New Albany, IN. Unlike the magic you see on TV, there are no fancy boxes and no TV edits. This is pure sleight of hand, live and up close.</p>
<h3><strong>The Story...</strong></h3>
<p>At the age of 22 I became a single father and was stuck in a job I hated, surrounded by people and things I knew would take me nowhere. Enter the <strong>Greater Louisville Magic Emporium</strong>; a small magic shop located in Jeffersonville, Indiana. I walked into that shop one day on my lunch hour and my life was changed. I saw something that was <strong>impossible</strong> and spent the next few days <strong>smiling</strong> every time I thought about it. I would quit my job less than a year later and go to work for that shop for $75 a week and become a full time <strong>student </strong>of magic. That shop changed the path of my life in a way that I can never explain. Its where I met my wife and where I sold Torched &amp; Restored, the very first trick I ever created and sold to other magicians. Yes, this is the same trick the Richard Jones used to win Britain's Got Talent in 2016. I've gone on to work for one of the largest magic companies in the world and to have my magic performed by magicians around the globe.  </p>
<p>I tell you all of this so you can understand how <strong>important </strong>magic is to me and my family, and also to the world. I want to <strong>create</strong> a space were people can <strong>share an experience</strong> that doesn't involve tiny screens and being disconnected from others. I want to create a space that's small, intimate, and immersive. A place that can give people a chance to see that people care about them and know that they can belong. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1548303436/mfqe5gqhknjcbomsfv4f.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>That's why I need your help. Putting this together won't be easy financially, but my family and I have taken the steps to downsize our lives and decrease our living expenses so we can make this happen. But even then, building out the theater is full of risk and hurdles. We are looking at around $30,000 to build out the space and create the shop. My family will be investing $20,000 but we are reaching out to magicians and to communities of New Albany, Southern Indiana, and Louisville, KY, asking for your support. </p>
<p>With your <strong>help</strong>, we will not only be able to remodel the space and build the theater, but also have a space to teach students of magic both young and old about the <strong>benefits</strong> of the art of magic. When the theater isn't being used to host shows, we will use it as a rehearsal space and training center for local magicians and magic enthusiasts. </p>

</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">We can't do it alone</h3>
<p>As you can <strong>imagine</strong>, building a theater and gift shop is an expensive undertaking. We need seats, lighting, a sound system, curtains, a concession bar, paint and other remodeling needs. We need an additional $10,000 to build this space out and make this a venue worthy of the acts we are bringing to town. Anything over the $10.000 will be used as working capital to help keep the shop open and allow us to work with local magicians and performance <strong>artists</strong> to bring their show to a broader audience.  </p>
<p>We have some <strong>exciting</strong> perks lined up, starting with high fives and hugs for those that just want to share the love of magic; T-shirts, and advance VIP tickets, as well as full consulting packages for those professional magicians looking to have Brent take their show to the next level. </p>

<p>In today's world, <strong>connecting</strong> with people is more important than ever. Having a small intimate theater space where we can come to together to learn more about each other and <strong>experience</strong> the <strong>impossible</strong> is important. </p>
<p>Having run live events for the past 5 years for the worlds largest magic company, I understand what it takes to create an experience that people will remember and appreciate. All of those events have been Five-Star rated for a reason and with your help, we can bring those experiences to a small theater and share them one person at a time. </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest struggle this project faces is getting people out of the house and into the space to share this experience. We truly <strong>believe</strong> that with your help and positive words we can help people understand how incredible sharing live experiences can be.  </p>
<p>That's the other reason we started this campaign. We need you to come see a show, tell a friend, write a review; we need your high fives, hugs and help. </p>

<p>My name is Kyle (Just Kyle).
I’m a visual artist living around Philadelphia, PA. I graduated from Ursinus
College with Honors in Studio Art and a minor focus in Gender and Women’s
Studies. I currently work at Art Research Enterprises creating large sculptures
and I volunteer at Millersville University as part of their Emerging Artists in Residency Program. I have
shown in several exhibitions, been interviewed for radio, and am going to be
among those published in a coming issue of Proto humanities Journal. I have been very
fortunate to have so many opportunities and the continuous support of many great mentors, professors, facilities, family, and friends. Now, I need help to realize my next
goal, but not without paying back my support system. Art and gender studies are my passion and they have precipitated into a
sculptural art series I call “To Deal.” It was the series that got me my Honors
in college and it’s been growing steadily since. I need your help to realize
its continued growth! <br/></p>
<p><b>The project.</b></p>
<p>
“To Deal” is the project
you would be supporting if you choose to donate or spread the word. It is a
multi-media sculptural/installation series that has been in the works for at
least 2 years. Its primary objective is to ignite conversations about gender
identity through discussions of home, the body, menstruation, craft, materials,
and tools. “To Deal” was created from intense personal conflict that I have
always experienced in relation to my own body. Dysphoria and anxiety impact my every day life and relationships and I felt unable to even speak about it in
the most private of settings. The art-making began as a way to healthily cope
after a decade of coping in all the wrong ways. It began to bridge gaps in
my personal relationships, made it possible to explain my situation, and make
connections with people who both did and did not experience gender identity
crisis. The ability of art to help myself cope; offer solace, comfort, and
understanding to others; and be the ignition for enlightenment for others is
the importance of this project to me and why I cannot let it cease.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Needs and Rewards</h3> <p>

</div></div>","Summary Meet the artist.
My name is Kyle (Just Kyle).
I’m a visual artist living around Philadelphia, PA. I graduated from Ursinus
College with Honors in Studio Art and a minor focus in Gender and Women’s
Studies. I currently work at Art Research Enterprises creating large sculptures
and I volunteer at Millersville University as part of their Emerging Artists in Residency Program. I have
shown in several exhibitions, been interviewed for radio, and am going to be
among those published in a coming issue of Proto humanities Journal. I have been very
fortunate to have so many opportunities and the continuous support of many great mentors, professors, facilities, family, and friends. Now, I need help to realize my next
goal, but not without paying back my support system. Art and gender studies are my passion and they have precipitated into a
sculptural art series I call “To Deal.” It was the series that got me my Honors
in college and it’s been growing steadily since. I need your help to realize
its continued growth! 
The project.

“To Deal” is the project
you would be supporting if you choose to donate or spread the word. It is a
multi-media sculptural/installation series that has been in the works for at

identity through discussions of home, the body, menstruation, craft, materials,

crisis. The ability of art to help myself cope; offer solace, comfort, and
understanding to others; and be the ignition for enlightenment for others is
the importance of this project to me and why I cannot let it cease.   Needs and Rewards 

Project needs.
My funding needs are material based and my material needs list can be
found on my artist website at kylejustkyle. If you cannot donate monetarily
and would rather donate the specific item (like if you have an old hammer or
trowel) contact me! I’m super into recycling materials and being
cost-effective.
The perks.
My perks are what I make besides the “To Deal” series: tatting and drawing. To see what's up for grabs check out this page's gallery.
The tatting is all handmade by me with a tatting shuttle and thread (yep, that's it). I'll be offering my own original designs that range from single to multi-layered pieces. But what does that mean? Basically, all tatting is beautiful, but as the layer count increases, so does the visual complexity, time commitment, and worth of the piece. My tatting is not only original but award-winning. My celtic designs (multi-layered pieces) in particular. My larger designs can be used as coasters for your favorite mug, ornaments, and wall decor; medium can be bracelets or large bookmarks; smaller designs can be used for festive ornaments, hair accents, necklace pendents, keychain accents, bookmarks -- basically anything you want. They're quite the versatile perk!




My drawings are usually notebook paper dimensions or less, but don't let the size dismay you - they are a packed visual feast with my stream-of-consciousness style drawing. These will be images you will continue to revisit and discover anew.
If you know you want a specific print/drawing, let me know upon check out and I will do my best to accommodate the request! Otherwise it will be a random selection and a surprise! Check out the gallery for options.

These are some of the ready-to-go options for drawn perks; there will be more to come! Each print is signed and numbered.All the perk levels include the perk of being included in my patron's list which means that I will mention your patronage on my website and in self-published publications. I am extremely grateful to my patrons! Thank you!If you donate be sure to let me know your option choice, drawing preference, and/or color choices either upon check out in note to organizer or via email at kylepetersonstudio@yahoo.com.
Unmet needs. Oh no.
Even if I do not achieve the entire amount I will purchase
enough materials to continue with whatever I do achieve (I am resourceful).
Yay!    The Impact 

The world.

    Risks & Challenges What could go wrong?
The risks are small and few. I already have space to work,

is lack of funds. And you can help.

</div></div>","Our Story

Rock & Roll Portraits is the first large project by Jackson Potts ii.  The concept is that Jackson will further develop his skills as a photographer by creating images for musicians, images that not only look interesting but have significance to that specific band or individual, and doing so by using a variety of techniques.  A public showing of his collection will be held at Catalina Coffee August 17th - October 2nd 2011.  He will need to photograph 8-12 artists to have a complete body of work.

The process will involve an interview, where Jackson will learn more about the band and find significant, unique qualities of the band to explore and then base his images on.  He will then present a few different concepts to the artists, and receive their feedback.  After he has finalized the concept, he will create  a lighting diagram so he can communicate to his assistants what his lighting needs are.  And finally, he will conduct the photo shoot.

The Impact
Rock & Roll Portraits, by Jackson Potts ii has partnered with Living Water International, our partnership will allow this event and project to become something bigger, clean drinking water to people that otherwise may not have access to clean water.  Any money made from this show, will be going to a project that Jackson will be doing for Living Water International.  next summer, Jackson, Dietrich, and Jack (dad) will be going to Africa for 45-60 days.  Jackson will be photographing his experience to put together a coffee table book to raise support and awareness and Rock & Roll portraits, will help get us there.



 
Why We Need $900 

$900 Prints and Frames
This is the cost for 8 images, to print and frame. During the process I will be going to a lab to better understand the printing process and to a professional framer so I can see how to pick frames and learn how to framing works.

Mom and Dad are “sponsoring” my other costs) 
I would like to thank my Family for covering all my other costs for this project.  I know a lot is going into this and I am grateful for my family and all the others that are helping make this happen

Promotions
Flyers $100, Posters $100, Stickers $100, T-shirts $200 (so we have some stuff to give away and get people to the show)

Reception
basic bites and drinks, so people feel welcome.

Travel
we have one 4 day trip to Austin; food, gas and one hotel.  Mom & Dad will cover that, along with all the other random expended along the way.
After Party
the bands are donating their talent and Warehouse Live is donating the venue.


Thank You Perks...

All of which are very close to our hearts. We’re extremely excited and blessed to have this opportunity to be involved in something that is seamlessly combining all of these together, giving us all our moments to shine and grow. This year, we've come together as one and decided that it was our time to give back to the playa in a way that will make a mark on house music sound camps at Burning Man for many years to come.</strong></strong></p>
<p>We’ve applied and received placement for a sound camp at 10 o'clock and GDP. This is right in the heart of some of most amazing sound camps for house music at Burning Man. We know that we will deliver a great musical experience for all those on the Playa to come and enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>CONCEPT AND DESIGN</strong></p>
<p>We’re currently in the process of building a 32' tall pyramid that is 8'x8' at the base and sits on a 5’ tall stage and core foundation. We believe that this structure is a modern hybrid of a pyramid and an obelisk. The Pyramid has 28 6"" horizontal slats on all four sides. These slats will be illuminated from the interior with bright color changing light via eight 10-watt diode quad-core LEDs. The exterior will be illuminated with 16 additional LED pars. The structure is made of aluminum, wood and polycarbonate.</p>
<p>The coolest thing about the Kazbah Pyramid is that it houses a DJ booth at the base. The DJs will interact with the crowd through a 3'x6' cut out of the “All Seeing Eye”. The Eye will be lined with an High Density LED light strip. There will also be a 30-watt laser running through the spine of the structure out the top reaching miles into the sky. This petrified ray of sun energy will tap into divine frequencies, and radiate energy to all those who surround it with love, light, and sound.</p>
<p><strong>THE SOUND</strong></p>
<p>Our sound engineer has 8 years of experience working on some of the biggest sound camps on the Playa (Distrikt, Opulent Temple, Disco Knights, Center Camp Café) as well as Black Rock Arts. We will have 50,000 watts and 100 amps in a flat wall of sound aimed at the crowd. We will be providing clean, high definition sound without of two 17’ speaker stacks on each side of the stage and a dozen 18” subs, as well as to 2 qsc-k12s as booth monitors in the pyramid. With the exception of the qsc booth monitors, all the speakers are EAW. The DJs table is being made from 3 slabs of concrete on a rubber matt to reduce vibration. On that table will be 4 CDJ-2000s and a DJM-900 for the professionals to play on. </p>
<p><strong>THE MUSIC</strong></p>
<p>The style of music and energy one can expect at the Kazbah is cutting-edge, sophisticated, cerebral deep house, and melodic tech. The caliber of DJs we intend to bring will be only the best in the world. We will be throwing a daily sunset party starting in mid-afternoon and ending sometime between 10pm and midnight.</p>
<p><strong>HELP US GIVE BACK</strong></p>
<p>We just want to create an amazing vibe where people can come and enjoy the Pyramid, while listening to some incredible music on a super clean sound system.</p>
<p>We need funding to pay for the rental of the sound system and associated costs with running that sound: transport, fuel, generators, etc.</p>
<p>Help us make our dreams a reality for all those to enjoy at Burning Man 2013, and for years to come. We appreciate your support. Spread the word!  </p>

<h1><strong>Public Restrooms..</strong></h1>
<p>are a necessary evil. We've all used a public restroom at some point in our life and will most likely have to visit one again...soon.

<p>Let me set the scene. You've checked every stall and found the cleanest of them all. You push the door open, hang your bag, pull down your bloomers, and prepare to either sit or squat. What happens next is short of utter and complete death: As soon as you think you can relax and let nature take its course, you make eye contact with a perfect stranger who decided that instead of checking for feet that they would simply peer in via the large gaping space in-between your stall door. Awwwkward! Now, maybe it was an innocent faux pas, or as I have surmised, these types just altogether refuse to be burdened by the boundaries of basic etiquette when using public spaces. Either way, who really has time to figure out the ""<strong>why</strong>"" when you are sitting in a stall, bottomless?</p>
<p>I have created a unique product that will put an end to those errant eyeballs and give you the added privacy that you need in order to put the ""rest"" back in restroom. Introducing Privy potty strips!</p>
<h1>What makes Privy potty strips unique?</h1>
<p><strong>Flushable</strong>: Our strips are and the direct packaging are dissolvable. This means that they break completely down once submerged in water. Privy potty strips are easily applied over any menacing stall gaps and can be flushed right down the commode when done.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><ul>
<li>
<strong><strong>Eco friendly materials</strong></strong>: Made from eco-friendly 100% recyclable materials that contain zero VOC's, Privy potty strips are not only safe to flush but safe for the environment too.</li>
</ul></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><ul>
<li>
<strong>Superior protection in a small package</strong>: Privy potty strips provide protection for any stall. Measuring at 2"" wide and roughly 14"" long, they can protect you from the largest of gaps in between stall doors. Strips come bearing a deodorizing fresh scent to aid in blocking odor. Once you are finished, easily slip off and flush.</li>
<li>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Convenient</strong>: Grab a pack or two if you know you're heading out with the possibility of a not-so-private bathroom break. Our privacy strip packs can be stashed in your pocket for a quick trip to the restroom, your bag, a purse, or briefcase while you're on the move.</li>

</div></div>","Public Restrooms..
are a necessary evil. We've all used a public restroom at some point in our life and will most likely have to visit one again...soon. Every communal bathroom on the face of the planet has been humorously designed with embarrassingly awkward stall door gaps that are at minimum, as wide as the Grand Canyon.





 

Let me set the scene. You've checked every stall and found the cleanest of them all. You push the door open, hang your bag, pull down your bloomers, and prepare to either sit or squat. What happens next is short of utter and complete death: As soon as you think you can relax and let nature take its course, you make eye contact with a perfect stranger who decided that instead of checking for feet that they would simply peer in via the large gaping space in-between your stall door. Awwwkward! Now, maybe it was an innocent faux pas, or as I have surmised, these types just altogether refuse to be burdened by the boundaries of basic etiquette when using public spaces. Either way, who really has time to figure out the ""why"" when you are sitting in a stall, bottomless?
I have created a unique product that will put an end to those errant eyeballs and give you the added privacy that you need in order to put the ""rest"" back in restroom. Introducing Privy potty strips!
What makes Privy potty strips unique?
Flushable: Our strips are and the direct packaging are dissolvable. This means that they break completely down once submerged in water. Privy potty strips are easily applied over any menacing stall gaps and can be flushed right down the commode when done.
 


Eco friendly materials: Made from eco-friendly 100% recyclable materials that contain zero VOC's, Privy potty strips are not only safe to flush but safe for the environment too.

 


Superior protection in a small package: Privy potty strips provide protection for any stall. Measuring at 2"" wide and roughly 14"" long, they can protect you from the largest of gaps in between stall doors. Strips come bearing a deodorizing fresh scent to aid in blocking odor. Once you are finished, easily slip off and flush.



Convenient: Grab a pack or two if you know you're heading out with the possibility of a not-so-private bathroom break. Our privacy strip packs can be stashed in your pocket for a quick trip to the restroom, your bag, a purse, or briefcase while you're on the move.

Privy potty strips come in all natural deodorizing scents made from essential oils. Our strips currently come in 3 different scents -- fresh lemon, citrus, and eucalyptus. We also offer an unscented option. For backers interested in donating there is a reward option to create a customized scent, so that your strips can smell any way that you want them to.

<h2>Meet PACT</h2>
<p>Artistic Portland is a project of the Portland Artisans Co-op Team, also known as PACT.  We started at the end of December as a group of strangers who shared an idea, and turned into a tight-knit community that is turning that dream into reality.  Together, we are opening a retail co-operative store where we can sell our handmade goods.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>The store is an incredible opportunity for artisans</strong>.  Usually, individual craftspeople rely on expensive craft fairs or wholesale/consignment, and spend lots of time and energy marketing their work instead of creating -- and we often feel very alone.  We are keeping our fees as low as possible, to include artisans from every walk of life.  Artistic Portland is opportunity, community, and adventure in one.</p>
<p>We want to capture the creative spirit of Portland, with all its quirks and startling beauty.  With a wide variety of styles and price points, we offer something for all the different people of our city -- all of it high-quality, handcrafted, and locally made.</p>
<h2>Why donate?</h2>
<h3>The Importance of Handmade</h3>
<p>The handmade movement is taking off -- and with good reason.  It eliminates the industrial waste and unfair practices so common in modern manufacturing.  Handmade items are often better-made, last longer in the home, and support economy from the bottom up.</p>
<p>Taking the handmade work local just adds to those benefits.  While supporting local economies, it encourages communities and interpersonal connection.  It eliminates shipping expenses (and the extra packaging), and thus avoids the pollution that comes from transporting the goods.</p>
<p>Every item in our shop will be the work of our members -- people you can meet, connect with.  You'll know where all of our supplies come from, and what practices your money is supporting.</p>
<h3>Better than Boutique</h3>
<p>If you go into a store that sells handmade items, it's likely to be closer to the 'boutique' model -- fine items and very high prices.  While those stores provide a valuable contribution, we find them a bit exclusive.  What for the people whose aesthetic is more natural?  What about the strange, the eclectic, the rough-edged styles?</p>
<p>Portland is home to a variety of vibrant communities, and we didn't want any of them excluded.  So whether you have five dollars to spend or five hundred -- whether you make swarovski-studded jewelry or Dr. Seuss buttons -- we want to welcome all kinds of people into our store.</p>
<h3>The Entrepreneur's Dilemma</h3>
<p>The artist's dream is to create all the time, but the necessities of selling take energy away from our true work.  We have to manage our own finances, market ourselves, package and ship orders, do our graphic design -- and if we can't do those things, we have to find money to pay for them.  It's a constant struggle for time, and it can get lonely, too.</p>
<p>To sell at an art fair, you need to have a table, lights, displays, perhaps a tent -- you need transportation and time -- and even if you do everything right, the attendance might be poor, or it might rain, and the money you spent on admission is lost.  Having a permanent home for our work removes so much time and uncertainty from the equation -- time that we can spend plying our trade.</p>
<p>The cooperative model is beautiful because it provides not only a location from which to sell, but it provides community.  We can support one another, collaborate on creative projects, and help each other with promotion.  Together, we can accomplish more than any of us can alone.</p>
<h2>Where does the money go?</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>We're lucky to have a lot of resources available in our own community.  Among our members, we have accountants, graphic designers, management professionals, teachers, interior designers, and more -- all using our unique skills to create a successful and well-organized model.</p>
<p><strong>Membership dues will cover our monthly expenses, but we need your help to get started.</strong></p>
<p>With the money we raise here, we'll be able to purchase the basics for opening a store.  We need a register and point-of-sale software to ensure the security of transactions.  We need furniture for displays and backroom storage, and resources to prepare the space for business.</p>
<p>Once the store is set up, we'll need to get the word out.  We know that Portland folk will love us, but they need to hear about us first!</p>
<p>The more funding we receive, the better our infrastructure can be.</p>
<h3>Donor Gifts</h3>
<p>Check out our list of perks to see the rewards we're offering for donations as small as $5.  All of the items are handmade by PACT members -- the same incredible products we'll have in the store.  There are multiple options for the same donation level, so be sure to check them all out before choosing.</p>

The coloring book is now at the printers. Thank you for wanting us to succeed. You can buy the coloring book at www.sammyrose.seI´m a photographer from Sweden and blogger from the world of DosFamily.com I want to 
turn my photographs into a coloring book. My hubby Jens , who is an 
illustrator will be tracing 20-something photographs -turning them into coloring sheets.I take pictures of pretty much everything. Now I want to turn my pictures into the coolest coloring book ever! Everyone who pre orders will receive the coloring book. If the campaign 
goal is reached we will put the book into production. Ready to hit those 
Christmas stockings.How will this story end?Like this:-We raise 2200 dollars and make as many copies of this Coloring Book as we can. Ready for delivery on Dec 10th worldwide!Or like this:-We only print the Coloring Book in enough copies to cover all the pre- orders. 2? 30? 57? Ready for delivery on Dec 10th worldwide.From photo to coloring sheet.Sometimes we add something to the coloring sheet to make it more fun to color. For example dots.The Coloring Book will contain around 20 coloring sheets. Here are some of the photos that will be turned into coloring sheets.The world need more coloring books that rock! I
 find it difficult to find cool coloring books. And even a hardcore 
Spiderman fan might want to color something else once in a while. Don´t 
underestimate your kids. They like other stuff then princesses and 
actionfigures. I´m being transparent!-telling you how it is!
We love what we do, Jens and I. Photographing and illustrating. But we ´re not in love with the idea of spending 2200 dollars on something that won´t sell. We´ve been there before. Trust me it´s no fun when your mom is the only one saying ""I´ll buy one!""It is risky investing money in a product. Especially when you are a small business like Jens and I. We need 2200 dollars to cover the printing costs of 1000 copies.I would hate having those copies collecting dust in our wardrobe. That´s 
why we are asking for you support. We want to know:Would you buy this coloring book?If so show us by contributing. 

This Coloring Book is for both kids and adults. 

Coloring is not only fun it is also soothing for a stressed brain. 

Leave the dishes for another day and sit down with this Coloring Book and a box of crayons and start coloring together.

<h3>(French version follows - La version française se trouve au bas!)</h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>The story</strong></p>
<p>Charles is a new kid in school. He wears long blonde hair, longer than any girl in the classroom, and for that reason he is teased by his classmates. At recess, the boys don't want him in their soccer team because he is too girly, and the girls don't want him in their girl-only club.</p>
<p>It's only at home that he can express his true self. He insists to his parents that he is a she named Charlotte, and dresses with frilly skirts and ribbons. With the help of her friend Chloe, she will find the courage to present as the person she wishes to be.</p>
<p>« Charles is not a boy, » a book about empowering gender-nonconforming children, is the kind of book every school library should own.</p>
<p><strong>The Author</strong></p>
Geneviève Labelle is a Montréal-based art teacher, children's book author, traditional storyteller and fingerweaver. She never identified with the gender she was assigned with at birth.
<p>Now, as a children's book author, Geneviève tries to bring a little light in the life of children that often feel ostracized by society or pushed towards gender conformism through societal pressure.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As the book will be released simultaneously in french and in english, we will need funding to keep the printing costs at the lowest rate possible, so that we can distribute the book at a larger scale.</p>
<p>About the editing, the author deals with a small-size children litterature editing house from Montréal, Qc, called Les Éditions du Fléché, that has already edited one of her previous work. The book will be 32 pages long, and printing a thousand copies in both languages will cost approximatively 2,500$.</p>
<p>Funding will also contribute to pay for the material needed for the project, like cardboards, inks and brushes, as well as promoting material for the book.</p>
<p>The book is scheduled to be out by mid-december.</p>
<p><strong>The Perks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Digital downloads of the book, signed copies and promotional material such as posters and t-shirts for small donations!</li>
<li>Book donations to specific schools or organisms, original artwork and more!</li>
<li>They are a couple of cats appearing through the book. Have your own pet be part of the story!</li>
<li>Have some characters bear the name of your choice!</li>
<li>And much more!</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The intention behind this book is to explore the problematic of gender-conforming at school. We want to bring the children's attention to the special needs of transgender boys and girls.</p>
<p>As the children's book industry only holds a few titles that frankly discuss those issues, this one will surely have a great place amongst the tools used in elementary school to help explain gender to children.</p>
<p>There are many communities out there that are only waiting for such a book to be published!</p>
<p> </p>

Short Summary
The story
Charles is a new kid in school. He wears long blonde hair, longer than any girl in the classroom, and for that reason he is teased by his classmates. At recess, the boys don't want him in their soccer team because he is too girly, and the girls don't want him in their girl-only club.
It's only at home that he can express his true self. He insists to his parents that he is a she named Charlotte, and dresses with frilly skirts and ribbons. With the help of her friend Chloe, she will find the courage to present as the person she wishes to be.
« Charles is not a boy, » a book about empowering gender-nonconforming children, is the kind of book every school library should own.
The Author
Geneviève Labelle is a Montréal-based art teacher, children's book author, traditional storyteller and fingerweaver. She never identified with the gender she was assigned with at birth.
Now, as a children's book author, Geneviève tries to bring a little light in the life of children that often feel ostracized by society or pushed towards gender conformism through societal pressure.
 

What We Need & What You Get
As the book will be released simultaneously in french and in english, we will need funding to keep the printing costs at the lowest rate possible, so that we can distribute the book at a larger scale.
About the editing, the author deals with a small-size children litterature editing house from Montréal, Qc, called Les Éditions du Fléché, that has already edited one of her previous work. The book will be 32 pages long, and printing a thousand copies in both languages will cost approximatively 2,500$.
Funding will also contribute to pay for the material needed for the project, like cardboards, inks and brushes, as well as promoting material for the book.
The book is scheduled to be out by mid-december.
The Perks

Digital downloads of the book, signed copies and promotional material such as posters and t-shirts for small donations!
Book donations to specific schools or organisms, original artwork and more!
They are a couple of cats appearing through the book. Have your own pet be part of the story!
Have some characters bear the name of your choice!
And much more!
 
The Impact
The intention behind this book is to explore the problematic of gender-conforming at school. We want to bring the children's attention to the special needs of transgender boys and girls.
As the children's book industry only holds a few titles that frankly discuss those issues, this one will surely have a great place amongst the tools used in elementary school to help explain gender to children.
There are many communities out there that are only waiting for such a book to be published!

<h3>Fox Models International</h3>
<p>is a model scouting firm that introduces potential models to top model management agencies. They have placed over 150 models at premier agencies such as IMG, Elite, Wilhelmina, Ford Models, Trump, Model Management, One Model Management, Click Model Management, Next Model Management and Marilyn Agency.</p>
<p>They have modeling show cases each year held at Disney World in Florida. It's a two day event-the first is a learning day. The second is the audition in front of 14-15 TOP agencies. This is a HUGE opportunity for anyone-especially for me because I am on a tight time schedule with my age being 22. If I am going to get discovered it has to be soon. What better of a chance do I have getting discovered when I am in front of all TOP agencies in the US.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>$650 participation fee. (I know its a lot but you need to invest money to make money). It's a risk I am willing to take to follow and pursue my dreams.</li>
<li>Flights 300-400 round trip.</li>
<li>Hotel $135 a night-willing to stay just one or two nights.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This could change my life forever. I have the opportunity to be discovered-it's not going to happen here in Syracuse, NY. Out of 100-150 girls 15 will be signed-I could be one of them! I am ready and willing to take that risk to get me to the next step. If it doesn't work out what happens? I have a rewarding experience. I at least can say I tried to pursue my dreams of becoming a model and can move on to the next chapter of my life with some closure.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute its okay! I understand its a tough economy which is why I am using this website to raise money for this event. The next best thing for me would be to spread the word to people that you think can afford to contribute.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Again I thank you whether you were able to donate or not. Every dime of this will be put towards this great opportunity. I hope this is a success.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My video is from a recent modeling contest I did out of LA! Shows a little more of my modeling career so far.</p>

<h3>The Idea:</h3>
<p>The purpose of this project is threefold: to gain exposure as artists, to be part of something bigger than oneself, and to offer affordable art to the average consumer. </p>
<p>Most artists love to create but they don't have the skills or desire to market their work. Brick and mortar galleries can't afford to risk their wall space on an unknown artist, and art shows can be expensive and a waste of time. Artists are often left feeling deflated with no real outlet to show their talent and hard work. </p>
<p>One ft2 offers a unique opportunity to emergent artists. Artists from around the world collaborate with One ft2 to create a collection made up of small, representative pieces that serve as a marketing tool for each individual artist. Each piece is an original work of art created on a One ft2 branded panel measuring 12""x12"" (one foot square). Because each piece is uniform in size it is easy to group, making an attractive display for any wall. Art collectors, interior designers and home owners can collect pieces from artists all over the world! </p>
<p>Artists are chosen based on their creative abilities demonstrated in their existing body of work. Their completed piece(s) stay in their hands until it is purchased. The artist sends their piece directly to the buyer along with their own marketing material. We believe that once a buyer can hold a piece in his/her hands and see it in his/her own environment he/she is more likely to contact that artist to purchase work that is not part of the One ft2 Collection. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Where we're at:</h3>
<p>One ft2 was founded by artist, Lisa Powers. Endless hours of developing the business concept and building the website has made One ft2 what it is today. We have a small number of artists who are currently creating the first pieces for the One ft2 Collection. This Collection shall be ever changing and growing. </p>
<p>We need to attract more artists! We want to offer excellent pieces from artists around the world. (Artist Submission is FREE!) Once we have the artists on board, we then need to take the One ft2 Collection to market - and advertising is pricey! </p>
<p>The idea behind One ft2 World-wide Artist Collaboration is a good one! We need to get the word out so we can bring those who appreciate art to those who create it. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello.  We are Deanna Brown and Lorrie Pierson at Heartfire Creations, LLC.  Our goal is to bridge the gap between 'artsy' people and 'ordinary' people, by creating a whole new place to display artwork:  the fireplace.   We imagine home after home replacing their imitation ceramic logs with original sculpture, crafted from the same fireproof material as the imitation logs; a marriage of art and fire.  We want to commission artwork from established or emerging artists, in which the fire itself becomes an element of the work. Homeowners will find that whatever their particular interest, niche or desire, it can be expressed as a piece of art displayed in the most beautiful possible way: in the fire itself.  The possible range of expression is limitless, from abstract to figurative, erotic or gothically morbid or comic; mythical, modern, narrative or simply illuminating form with the hypnotic flickering light that is fire.  Artists will find new inspiration for creating work and buyers will find artwork that they want to live with in their homes.    </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have already completed proof of concept prototypes, which we have posted for you in the video.  We are prepared to manufacture on demand, and are in early talks with an international distributor.  Funds raised will  be spent to commission original pieces from working artists and have them manufactured in the fireproof final form.  Artists will be paid full commissions up front and any future sales of a piece will involve full accreditation of the artwork to the artist. They will receive ongoing royalty payments so that if a piece becomes popular it will remain as a continuing source of income to the artist. Artists will be required  to provide an artists' statement and contact links so that if buyers wish to obtain further pieces they can do so.</p>
<p>In order to accommodate a variety of fireplace sizes, we will invest in 3D scanning services, scaling work up and down as needed. 3D scanning also offers limitless possibilities for creating original works, by capturing images from the 'real' world, and rendering them in fireproof 3D.  For example, a classic car buff could have their dream car roaring up out of the flames; the gargoyles of Paris can come to life in your own fire.  An existing original piece can be scanned and recreated in the new medium.   We dream of art and fire, both the joy of the creators in making it and the delight of the owner in having it; every time they light the fire, or even when it is not lit: beautiful, or awful, intense, evocative, gruesome, erotic, comic, heartbreaking, uplifting, disturbing or calming, enduring, ephemeral- artistic, every day.  </p>
<p>This is a project of imagination and we want to crowdsource the dream not just the money to get started.  We will be seeking artists' submissions of possible work to be created and those submissions will be posted online with a Firework forum of backers to evaluate, critique and help select which works will be translated first into the new medium.   All backers will have access to this forum, and we hope to work with some of you in creating actual pieces and traveling abroad to capture images of ancient art to be given new life in a most modern fashion.  When the project moves into the next phase, with artwork submitted, critiqued and chosen, we will have a smashing party to celebrate the achievement with artists, backers, our manufacturers and Heartfire offering mutual congratulations over good food, with music, video, art and fire.  </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In our headiest moments, we imagine nothing less than a revolution in the fireplace world, in which imitation logs become a relic of the past, or at least just one option among many (more interesting) others.  Artists will have a new outlet for their work, possibly a new source of inspiration.  We also live, however, in the real world, where people struggle simply to heat their homes, cook their food and sanitize water for drinking.    Therefore, upon our company's success, we will donate 10% or more of sales to projects which are seeking to improve peoples lives in more fundamental ways; beginning with Masons on a Mission (<a href=""http://www.masonsonamission.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.masonsonamission.org</a>), who works to provide families in Guatemala with enclosed masonry cook stoves to reduce respiratory disease in women and their families created by cooking over open flames.  The masonry stoves require less fuel to generate heat than open flame, resulting in fewer trees cut down for firewood, and less labor for women and children.  Rocket stoves, or thermal mass heaters, can provide heat for a home and a cooking surface with 85% reduction in fuel consumed, and a huge decrease in emissions from combustion, as the volatile gasses which normally go up the chimney become the fuel in the much hotter fire.  From luxury and delight in our country, to improved quality of life around the world, we hope to touch the lives of thousands of human beings before it's over.  </p>
<p>Our product is manufactured in Oregon, by adults working for a decent wage.  Any and all influence we develop as a result of our success will be used to oppose child labor, sweatshops and the exploitation of human beings and the environment for profit.  </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are an artist and are inspired, please submit a proposal for commission to the project.  If you know an artist, please encourage them to participate.  Artists submissions will be collected in the professional gallery for review/selection by the Fireforum.</p>
<p>If you are not an artist, but are still inspired, please feel free to submit a sketch, a description, or a picture of the art which you imagine would be most amazing in the fire. Submissions will be collected in an Idea Gallery for review and possible selection by the Fireforum.  </p>
<p>Take time to help someone, in whatever way you can imagine.  Our world is in trouble no matter which way you look, but through shared passion, shared vision and shared work, we can make a difference.  Thank you.</p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Short Summary

In our headiest moments, we imagine nothing less than a revolution in the fireplace world, in which imitation logs become a relic of the past, or at least just one option among many (more interesting) others.  Artists will have a new outlet for their work, possibly a new source of inspiration.  We also live, however, in the real world, where people struggle simply to heat their homes, cook their food and sanitize water for drinking.    Therefore, upon our company's success, we will donate 10% or more of sales to projects which are seeking to improve peoples lives in more fundamental ways; beginning with Masons on a Mission (www.masonsonamission.org), who works to provide families in Guatemala with enclosed masonry cook stoves to reduce respiratory disease in women and their families created by cooking over open flames.  The masonry stoves require less fuel to generate heat than open flame, resulting in fewer trees cut down for firewood, and less labor for women and children.  Rocket stoves, or thermal mass heaters, can provide heat for a home and a cooking surface with 85% reduction in fuel consumed, and a huge decrease in emissions from combustion, as the volatile gasses which normally go up the chimney become the fuel in the much hotter fire.  From luxury and delight in our country, to improved quality of life around the world, we hope to touch the lives of thousands of human beings before it's over.  
Our product is manufactured in Oregon, by adults working for a decent wage.  Any and all influence we develop as a result of our success will be used to oppose child labor, sweatshops and the exploitation of human beings and the environment for profit.  


Other Ways You Can Help
If you are an artist and are inspired, please submit a proposal for commission to the project.  If you know an artist, please encourage them to participate.  Artists submissions will be collected in the professional gallery for review/selection by the Fireforum.
If you are not an artist, but are still inspired, please feel free to submit a sketch, a description, or a picture of the art which you imagine would be most amazing in the fire. Submissions will be collected in an Idea Gallery for review and possible selection by the Fireforum.  
Take time to help someone, in whatever way you can imagine.  Our world is in trouble no matter which way you look, but through shared passion, shared vision and shared work, we can make a difference.  Thank you.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>Walls of Dreams/Dreams of Walls</b></p>
<p>“Walls of Dreams/Dreams of Walls” is artist Shira E Landman’s meditation; both on the history of a place and on the nature of historical truth. This is done by taking pictures of the deteriorating bricks at Fort Pike, often in close-up, and rendering them abstract- printed on metal.</p>
<p>Rather than merely documenting what remains of Fort Pike through its walls, Landman meditates or dreams of the walls’ meanings and what can still be felt: The dreams of all those who have encountered Fort Pike — within its walls or outside; For the Native Americans and the African American slaves incarcerated here; The soldiers who also dreamed of returning to families and who wanted to protect the U.S; And now of the park rangers who dream of preserving it — and history.</p>
<p>“Wall of Dreams/Dreams of Walls” will be a permanent metal Installation for the Fort Pike Historic Site - raising continued awareness of the importance of Wetlands, preserving the Fort, and its history.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>ABOUT THE ARTIST</b></p>
<p>Shira Landman was born in Stuttgart, Germany in 1965. She has lived in Italy, France, Israel and the U.S., where she attended The Academy of Art University in San Francisco. After 12 years in New Mexico, Landman moved to New Orleans, Louisiana, where she continues making art and working as a set medic on movie sets. Last summer she worked on the Television series “True Detective” close to Fort Pike; this is where she was introduced to the current Park Rangers. Her environmental art in metal and sculpture focuses on her interests in wilderness, wildlife, landscapes, endangered species, particularly on the themes of life and decay. The environmental Art ""Lioness"" (2001) is featured in Lucy Lippard's book <i>Undermining</i>.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>THE HISTORY OF FORT PIKE</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Fort Pike, located 23 miles east of New Orleans, was built in 1819 in the wetlands of Louisiana to protect New Orleans from attack by land or sea. From 1826 when construction was complete to 1890 when it was finally abandoned, Fort Pike served multiple purposes beyond its explicit role of protection. In the end not a single cannon was shot at Fort Pike.</p>
<p>During the Seminole Wars in the 1830s, Fort Pike served as: a staging ground for troops headed to Florida for combat; a prison where Seminole Indians, and the black runaway slaves who formed alliances with them, were held until they could be relocated to Oklahoma, per the so-called Indian Removal Act; and during the Mexican War of the 1840s, soldiers traveling to Texas and Mexico often stayed at Fort Pike.</p>
<p>During the Civil War, after New Orleans fell to the Union Forces who took over Fort Pike, Fort Pike became a refuge for Confederate army deserters, both runaway slaves and freeman from Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana; white Southerners with Northern sympathies; Northerners stuck in the south during the outbreak of the war wishing to return home; and for those seeking protection from opportunistic criminals in the northern lake shore during an unstable period in that region’s history. The Union Forces also used Fort Pike as a training ground for The United States Colored Troops, composed of African Americans first recruited to the Union Army during the Civil War, and who, by its end, in 1865, constituted one tenth of its Army.</p>
<p>Abandoned in 1890 and placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, Fort Pike’s once grand citadel and surrounding structures — its hospital, living quarters, carpenter and blacksmiths shop, stores, bakers and boat houses — have disappeared to fires and the surrounding waters.</p>
<p>What’s left is a ghostly shell of what it once was. But Fort Pike’s walls still have their stories.</p>
<p><b>WHAT THE FUNDS WILL PAY FOR &amp; WHAT YOU WILL GET</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
</div><p><b>The funds will pay for permanent contemporary installation at Fort Pike in the Citadel where You can experience the history and learn about the importance of preserving Wetlands.</b></p><p>“Walls protect, keep things out, and lock things in,” Landman says. But in Walls of Dreams/Dreams of Walls, Landman has created an anti-wall, one that is porous and flexible, capable of allowing the spirit and imagination to soar, like a feather. </p><p>The funds</p><ul>

</div><p>
When
I was a little child, my grand-mother used to tell me stories for the
people of her village. She was describing with passion their life and
culture, so hard and difficult that many of them travelled abroad to
have a better chance in life, and she showed me the handcrafts of her
mother, embroidered with silk and gold, made beside the fireplace, on
the light of a candle. I got really impressed from it and was proud
when I wore the traditional costume in national feasts, looking
forward to learn more for my ancestors.</p>
<p>
 When
I grew up, I realized that every place in Greece has a unique
traditional identity. Costumes varied from place to place reflecting
the sense of aesthetics of the society and followed the morals and
traditions of it. The textiles, the embroideries, the quality and
quantity of clothes showed not only the financial situation of the
family but also the historic continuity, the state of women in the
society and the elegance of the person wearing them.  Moreover the
handcrafted jewels ornamenting the outfits, reflected the art of the
greek goldsmiths and they were strongly connected with marriage, as
they were offered by the groom as a sign of the betrothal and reward
for the dowry. 
</p>
<p>
 I
collected enough material to present you a book showing the treasures
of the folk civilization taken out of a research that had more than
ten years to be completed and documented by its bibliography,
consisting of about 200 references from old books and personal
testimonies. 125 colorful photos guide the reader through time and
culture. Rare embroideries, dresses and textiles are taken off the
closets and are photographed for first time, to inspire the artists
and let the collectors know about them. Exclusive silver and
gold-plated jewels, hidden for many years, are exposed to the lens
and show their glamour and art of the greek goldsmiths. 19<sup>th</sup>
century greek silver and gold coins, used then as decorative
elements, constituted furthermore a display of wealth. 
</p>
<p>
The
traditional costumes presented in this book, seem to be the
development and theevolution
of the byzantine attitudes. The ancient greek <i>chiton,
</i>the
roman<i>
stolam </i>and
later the byzantine<i>
dalmatiki </i>were
substituted by the greek folk chemises. The later, richly decorated
with floral and geometrical patterns seem also to have a relationship
with ancient worships, since ancient gods’ symbols are found
embroidered on the chemises’ hem to transfer fertility and beauty
on the woman. All types of flowers parade on women’s clothes in
exceptional makeshift designs and symbols like the triangle and the
snake, found in many civilizations of the world like the Aztecs and
Egyptians, can also be found on the garments to protect the
superstitious Greeks from magic and evil eye, showing the global
spread of symbols among human social groups. Moreover the jewels
share with the ancient ones the same forms and designs, and
furthermore the goldsmiths have made them with the same ancient
techniques, showing the historical continuity of greek silverware.

<p>We are <b>BlueMagicRedDusk!</b></p>
<p>I'm Max, an experienced artist who draws Cari-creatures, which I also call ""<b>Guardians</b>"". They are called Cari-Creatures because they are like a caricature, but they are whatever I feel about a person as far as their personality and current energetic state but in the form of a creature. The creatures look monstrous, surreal, and whimsical and encourage people to empower and stay true to themselves. My process of drawing these beings begins with me in a calm mental state, asking to meet with my guides. After I feel I am in deep enough meditation, I ask to meet their guide as a Guardian, and the images I receive in my imagination are always accurate! I will quickly draw a sketch and then be asked to be guided in completed what I started.</p>

<p>I also work with my partner, Rafaella, a tarot reader, energy healer, artist and intuitive channeler. The soul portraits she creates are beautiful and colorful drawings using symbols that are based on a person's individual energy. All her readings and channelings are gifted with the intention of healing and aligning with one's higher self and spirit guides. She allows people to ask as many questions as they'd like to explore for their readings until they feel complete. Her interpretation of Tarot cards are not scary, but aware that life has challenges and unexpected events that may happen. </p>

<p><b>""Really beautiful. Both the channeling and portrait were a perfect connection to my energy and essence yet you weren’t telling me something I had heard before. Almost as if your reading reminded me to look again at the multidimensional layers of my essence, as we are all so much more than we appear. And when I get bogged down in the details of the earthly plane, I can easily forget the true nature of my higher self. The chakra reading and clearing was really spot on.

</div></div>","Hi, I'm Beatrix Antal. I deal with glass engraving.                                   I live in Hungary, in Budapest, and glass engraving is here a less known art. I have learned the technique from British artists, I've gained my whole knowledge from the internet, and forgeign sites, as in Hungarian there is not much information about it.I would like to change that, and have edited a tutorial, which I would like to publish, in first stance in my homeland, as a book and as online material. There are a lot of people interested, who have engraving as a hobby, but they do not know what to order, and where from, vhat techniques can be used, and so on. This is why I would like to help them in their creative work, and popularise this wonderful art.
In order to improve myself, I need to improve my assets  and need a bigger investment. This is why I kindly ask you help.I would like to move to a bigger workshop, where there would be place for my glass furnace, and for different grinding machines. I plan it a workshop-gallery, where I could also show and sell my art and works. I have a lot of ideas, which I would like to realize.My further goal is to enter the international market.My clients are primarily private persons, and I work for specific orders. If my projects succeeds, I could create my own glass collections and promote them worldwide. Primarily they would be home decorations - glass bowls, vases, sculptures, image compositions.
I've got from my current clients very positive feedback, as such personalized engraved glass gifts give great pleasure.As soon as my project succeeds, you can see my work on the website, and everyone who helped in the realization of the project, will have a life-long discount.

Francis WongThe exhibition and community altar is a part of the third biennial international art gathering of Prospect New Orleans. The P.3+ program is directed at highlighting and promoting concurrent exhibitions and arts events put up by local artists. We feel it is important to represent a comprehensive cross section of local artists while the city is hosting national and international artists for this three month long event.   What We Need By and far, most of the materials the artists are using to produce the installation have come out of pocket or have been sourced from the site, the streets and local shorelines. However, we need to secure funding in order light the space. This is going to be an entirely outdoor exhibition and lighting the massive lot may prove challenging, both logistically and financially. Alongside the electric lighting elements we plan to illuminate the space with candles. Lots of them. Really and truly, we need money for candles and wax. You'll thank us later.

Other Ways You Can Help 
We are attempting to gather the last of the supplies we need to finish working on this collaborative exhibition and there are still so many things we need! Namely:gnarly woodoxidized iron/steel (anything this side of transportable)rope (lots!) and/or cable and/or chainwire (assorted)anything shiny (glass, mirror, crystal, glitter, copper, faerie shards)fabric & burlappaint! (any; rattle can, house, enamel, leftovers)lighting elements and extension cordscandles & wax (so many)other junk!!!If you have stuff hanging around that can be donated or if you have a line on where we can retrieve any of the above materials please give us a heads up by sending us a message! There's 11 of us and many of us are scroungers, but it's been a rough summer y'all. Also, I hope you like altars!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

the art and science of the traditional ceramic craft.<span>  They learned to identify clay deposits and
how to dig and process their own clay. 
They studied the painstaking process of developing and testing local
clay and glaze ingredients.  They learned
to throw forms on the potter’s wheel, and to build and fire kilns.  Most importantly, they learned the continuing
process of experimenting with new materials, techniques, forms, and glazes, a
process that allows them to combine the traditional influences of Chinese
heirloom pottery with those gained from modern artists and their own creative
impulses.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p>Siegrid’s work has been displayed in numerous galleries and
museums, including the Pinto Gallery in Antipolo, the CAV Wine Shop and Gallery
and the LeSouffle Restaurant and Gallery in Manila and the the BenCab Museum, Breathing
Space Gallery, Maryknoll Gallery, and Hill Station Restaurant in Baguio.<span>  Her work was displayed in the Ayala Museum’s
2009 “Ring of Fire” exhibit featuring the work of prominent Southeast Asian
ceramic artists, and she will make her international debut at the “Earth and

</div></div>","Siegrid Bangyay began discovering the art of ceramics in 2000 learning the craft with American artist Archie Stapleton.For 2 ½ years Stapleton taught Siegrid and the other apprentices
the art and science of the traditional ceramic craft.  They learned to identify clay deposits and
how to dig and process their own clay. 
They studied the painstaking process of developing and testing local
clay and glaze ingredients.  They learned
to throw forms on the potter’s wheel, and to build and fire kilns.  Most importantly, they learned the continuing
process of experimenting with new materials, techniques, forms, and glazes, a
process that allows them to combine the traditional influences of Chinese
heirloom pottery with those gained from modern artists and their own creative
impulses.

Siegrid’s work has been displayed in numerous galleries and
museums, including the Pinto Gallery in Antipolo, the CAV Wine Shop and Gallery
and the LeSouffle Restaurant and Gallery in Manila and the the BenCab Museum, Breathing
Space Gallery, Maryknoll Gallery, and Hill Station Restaurant in Baguio.  Her work was displayed in the Ayala Museum’s
2009 “Ring of Fire” exhibit featuring the work of prominent Southeast Asian
ceramic artists, and she will make her international debut at the “Earth and
Fire” exhibit of Contemporary Southeast Asian Pottery at the Workhouse Arts
Center in Lorton, Virginia, USA in October 2014.
This is a rare
opportunity for an artist from a remote area of the Philippines to emerge on a
global stage.



The purpose of
this project is to raise funds to allow Siegrid to attend the exhibition and
participate in the workshops associated with it.  The proposed schedule:
October

Oct
15: Travel to Sewanee, TN
Oct
16-24: Work with Archie Stapleton
Oct
25: Return to Washington DC area
Oct

The
exhibit venue will provide accommodation for 3 days. Aside from that time,
hotel accommodation will be necessary unless we can identify a potential host
living close enough to the venue to allow daily commuting. Accommodation and
food in Sewanee will be covered.
