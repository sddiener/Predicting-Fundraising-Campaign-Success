<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p>My book, Beyond Creativity, explores the intersection of creativity and curiosity and what they mean for creatives in the 21st century.<br/><br/>My name is Vy-Anh Nguyen and I am the author of Beyond Creativity. I wrote this book because I realized what was missing from my education before attending VCU and want to look into the role that creativity plays in our lives. I will be sharing my personal story, as well as others’ stories, in regards to their creative pursuits apart from their professional/classroom setting.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how to live a life full of creativity without boundaries. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for creative living in you. And then, ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool that will inspire your own creative endeavors.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about stories from individuals and companies that use curiosity as a platform for their creativity and have built businesses by initially exploring an industry that was unknown to them. You'll learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to pursue a life of creative freedom</li>
<li>How you can use your experience to help/connect people</li>
<li>How to change your mindset</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are interested in learning about how other people are using creativity to impact the lives of others and/or curiousity to inspire their own passion projects.<br/><br/>Beyond Creativity is a non-fiction book that speaks to students and educators who are looking to bring more creativity into classrooms or their everyday lives.</p>
<h3>The Book - Beyond Creativity</h3>The book is written in 3 Parts....<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the introduction + 5 additional chapters. These chapters will include the history of America’s schools, the creativity crisis, and how education has evolved over time. It will also include stories from current students and a professional in change management whose primary interest is bringing to light what schools aren’t teaching.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains Chapters 6-10. This portion will dive into personal stories from students and an established artist who has gone from being rejected from galleries to having his work featured at the Torpedo factory, including a story from a current business student who is working on a styling app to better improve the lives of middle/high school students.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains Chapters 11-15. This section will teach you how to find your creative path and change the way you approach your work in order to keep motivated. It will also include stories from different individuals who have taken a leap of faith and left their corporate jobs to follow a life that involves pushing others to find their passion and purpose.<br/> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>
<br/>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<br/> <ul>
<li>The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in July 2020</li>
<li>The Cover Design of my Book - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder!</li>
<li>The Layout Design for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Ebook Formats)</li>
<li>The Copyediting for My Book - to help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication</li>
<li>The Launch &amp; Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this summer</li>
</ul> When I pre-sell 100 copies of my book, I will publish. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish an audiobook. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition.<br/><br/>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:<br/><br/>When I publish, you will receive the following:<ul>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>The Strawberry Road</strong></p>
<p><i>I reached skyward to touch the universe . . . it wasn't far at all.</i></p>
<p>It took ten years to write this book. I focused on the beauty of every word and feeling of every experience being meaningful, melodic and true to the character.

The Strawberry Road
I reached skyward to touch the universe . . . it wasn't far at all.
It took ten years to write this book. I focused on the beauty of every word and feeling of every experience being meaningful, melodic and true to the character. It is about appreciating what is, and envisioning what could be.  I put more heart and reality and feeling into this book than in anything I had created before.
It could not have been borne at a more appropriate time.  I am proud to share it . . . Ritch
I am an artist and an author. I write about issues, thoughts and situations that are relevant and close to home. I have written comedies, one about cancer, and a dramas, one about about Native Americans, but none have been as relevant and timely as The Strawberry Road.
I have completed the book, edited it, designed the cover and interior and recently self-published it through Amazon (ebook and paperback). Now I am faced with the daunting task of promoting, marketing and getting the book in front of the readers.
Fortunately, I have solicited reviews from independent reviewers and authors- none of whom are known to me personally. I would not have continued if the reviews were not excellent - they were beyond my expectations and hopes. The reviews can be read on Amazon (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083RXGNZN).

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<i>Permission to Create</i> is a first of its kind album in a book, complete with lyrics and QR code links that play my songs. The book is about my journey as a professional musician, told through the lens of my songs and the stories and experiences that shaped their writing.<br/><br/>My name is Nate Jones and I am the author of <i>Permission to Create: Embrace your Art and Unleash your True Potential.</i> I wrote this book because like many artists, the Covid-19 pandemic greatly impacted my ability to earn a living doing what I love. People can’t go out to see live music, and musicians and performers of all kinds are really hurting financially. But its not just the financial aspect. For so many artists, live events and community are what nourishes their soul. They help inform our identity and sense of connection. Since I cannot earn money and express myself in the way I am used to, I decided to use my newfound free time to write this book.<br/><br/>I am embracing my role as a storyteller, as someone who conveys vital information to the rest of the tribe through my own experience and creative expression. I believe we have unlimited potential as human beings, and in this book I share my experiences of personal growth, triumph, and healing. I wanted to show fellow artists, musicians, and creative people that all hope is not lost, and our creativity must now flourish in new and exciting ways. Additionally, fans deserve to understand the process behind songwriting, and see how their favorite artists become inspired to create.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading these stories and listening to my music, you will discover your own creative potential. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to engage with your personal artistry, whether that be music or another art form. Why? Because just like me, YOU possess the innate potential to be whatever YOU want to be in life. I chose the title “permission to create” because I want people to know that they don’t need anyone else’s permission to express themselves creatively!<br/><br/>What sets this book apart is that I am presenting a new way of merging music, poetry, and literature. Each chapter revolves around a song, starting with the lyrics, and followed by a reflection on the themes and experiences from my life that relate to the song. I convey real stories and insights from my own journey as a professional musician, world traveler, and explorer of consciousness. I’ve also done something special and included QR code links to my songs on my website. This will allow you to scan the page with your phone and listen to the song as you read the chapter.<br/><br/>In these songs and stories, I explore the intersections of music, mindfulness, compassion, and altered states of consciousness. The coolest story I share in this book relates to the first song I ever released. In 2019 my song, Safe As We Can, ended up competing against this guy named Paul McCartney for not one, but two Grammy Awards!<br/><br/>In this book, you'll encounter the multifaceted dimensions of music, mindfulness, and consciousness through stories like:<br/> <ul>
<li>Walking down the street in France, entering a random speakeasy and being invited on stage to play drums with the house jazz quartet.</li>
<li>When the first song I ever released, Safe As We Can, made the Grammy Awards Ballot competing against Paul McCartney, Blink 182, The Black Keys, and Smashing Pumpkins!</li>
<li>Experiencing the healing powers of the visionary plant medicine Ayahuasca, and shortly thereafter being invited to provide music to guide people’s journeys at other sacred ceremonies and retreats.</li>
</ul>
<br/>On this journey, you’ll join me in exploring the creation of mindful music and discovering our true human potential through songs like:<br/> <ul>
<li>“Maple Leaf” — Observing and appreciating the interconnectedness of all things.</li>
<li>“One Day” — Understanding how just one day can truly make a big difference.</li>
<li>“Organic Song” — Learning to trust your intuition and live a life that is authentic to you.</li>
<li>""Write This Down — Realizing that everything you keep looking for is already inside of you.</li>
</ul>
<br/>You will love this book if you like rock and roll, exciting stories, spiritual music, and mindfulness. You'll also like this book if you believe in compassion toward people and animals. And you'll definitely like this book if you have experienced the insights and healing that come from altered states of consciousness.<br/><br/><i>Permission to Create</i> speaks to artists/musicians and people of all talents and abilities who want to embrace music, art, and mindful, conscious living in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>Permission to Create</i> inspires reflection and meaningful dialogue, exploring deep, engages you in questions like:<br/> <ul>
<li>What is holding me back from pursuing my dreams?</li>
<li>Is it possible to create a better community by making more mindful art and music?</li>
<li>Could plant medicine and altered states of consciousness help usher in a renaissance of human society and empower us to create a better world together?</li>
</ul>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing these topics will promote positive change for us all, leading to a more peaceful and prosperous society!<br/> <p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get:</strong></p> This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<br/> <ul>
<li>The editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in August of 2021.</li>
<li>The cover design of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)</li>
<li>The layout design for the interior of my book (physical copies, ebook formats).</li>
<li>The copy editing for my book to make sure the manuscript is error free prior to publication.</li>
<li>The launch &amp; promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this summer.</li>
</ul>
<br/>When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover and an audiobook.<br/><br/><br/>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:<br/> <ul>
<li>You will receive a personally autographed copy of my book when I publish.</li>
<li>Your name will appear in the Acknowledgments section of my book.</li>

I have struggled with obesity all my life, but I finally decided to stop making excuses, and lose the weight. I have lost over 300 lbs, in la little over a year, and I documented everything on my YouTube channel, The Fasting Fatman. I am now healthy and fit. Fasting has helped take care of my high blood pressure too. I used to take 10mg of Enalapril daily, to control my high blood pressure, now my blood pressure is normal, and I am no longer on medication. I am currently a certified fasting coach and I now help others transform their bodies and the way they relate to food.

HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT TO LOSE?  Hi! I'm Big John, YouTube's ""The Fasting Fatman."" This book is about a journey that took me from weighing 530 pounds to 215 pounds in just over a year. Along the way I learned a lot about myself, my eating addiction, and the best way to not only lose weight quickly, but keep it off for life. I have always been overweight, I've gone on countless diets, and bought hundreds of miracle pills, lotions, and equipment, to lose weight, to be ""normal.""  I would lose the excess weight many times over, only to always gain it all back, and then some.  I was obese as a child, and eventually I became a morbidly obese adult. This book will highlight my journey, and the new way of relating to food and my addiction that has not only managed to help me get in shape, but is also helping a large pool of people that I am currently coaching on my strategy for permanent weight loss. This book will be your guide to a new, healthier you. A you that is no longer controlled by food addiction.The Fasting Fatman’s method and philosophy is tested and refined with various fasting techniques that slowly but surely completely resets the appetite and causes a complete “paradigm shift” when it comes to your relationship with food. TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR HEALTH THROUGH FASTINGThis book will help you create a crystal clear picture of the health you really want, uncover hidden traps that causes you to fail at weight loss, and put together a specific plan to help you stop the madness and make becoming a healthier you a priority, and trust me, a healthier you will be your new obsession! MISSIONMy mission is to guide you on your journey to complete healthiness from the inside out. I believe that fasting will truly heal the mind and body, with the fringe benefit of rapid weight loss. I will share my experience with you, and you will come to understand that our food addiction is universal, therefore, if I can conquer my addiction, you can conquer yours.This book will teach you everything I did, and everything I learned to lose over 300 pounds in such a short time frame, I want to help people to stop being food addicts and learn how to keep the cravings under control.  THE PROBLEM  
Worldwide obesity has nearly tripled since 1975.
In 2016, more than 1.9 billion adults, 18 years and older, were overweight. Of these, over 650 million were obese.
39% of adults aged 18 years and over were overweight in 2016 (39% of Men and 40% of women), and 13% were obese.
Most of the world's population live in countries where overweight and obesity kills more people than underweight.
38 million children under the age of 5 were overweight or obese in 2019.
Over 340 million children and adolescents aged 5-19 were overweight or obese in 2016.
 Common Health Consequences of Being Overweight and Obesity Raised BMI is a major risk factor for noncommunicable diseases such as:
cardiovascular diseases (mainly heart disease and stroke), which were the leading cause of death in 2012;
diabetes;
musculoskeletal disorders (especially osteoarthritis – a highly disabling degenerative disease of the joints);
some cancers (including endometrial, breast, ovarian, prostate, liver, gallbladder, kidney, and colon).

The risk for these Non-communicable diseases increases, with increases in BMI.Childhood obesity is associated with a higher chance of obesity, premature death and disability in adulthood. But, in addition, obese children experience breathing difficulties, increased risk of fractures, hypertension, early markers of cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance and psychological effects.    Human beings can only be in one of the following states: Fed or Fasted. The problem in today’s modern world is that we are in the fed state most of the time. Unlike thousands of years ago when food was scarce, today we live in a world where food is in overabundance. Unfortunately, this may not be true for millions of people around the world, but the fact is that we are facing obesity and starvation epidemics simultaneously. But for most of you reading this right now, there is overabundance and food is literally available the moment you think about it.    THE SOLUTONTHE FASTING FATMAN’S BOOK: I didn’t get to weighing over 500 pounds by having good eating habits, but I was able to overcome my addiction and take control of my health!

<h3>¿Qué?</h3>
<p><strong>Aviones de papel</strong> habla de una época no muy lejana cuyas consecuencias aun nos golpean a día de hoy, especialmente, en aspectos sociales.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">«Tenía trece años recién cumplidos y fue la primera vez que me enfrenté a él». Así comienza la historia de Satur, una chica de un pueblo de Toledo que, con toda la inocencia de su niñez, pretende decidir sobre su propia vida. En plena dictadura del general Franco, desafía a su autoritario padre, cuya frase favorita es: «¡No se hable más!». Satur tiene que enfrentarse a siglos de tradición, que le han asignado un papel idéntico al de su madre y al de su abuela, sin más opciones que el sometimiento a una autoridad que había sido otorgada, como decían las monedas, por la gracia de Dios. El choque con la realidad es brutal y Satur acaba viendo pasar su vida desde el chiscón de una portería de la capital.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Satur nos cuenta, con un lenguaje directo y sencillo, su  historia, marcada desde el principio por los enfrentamientos con su padre y por su odio al tabaco, que la llevará a vivir los momentos más trágicos de su vida. A lo largo de la novela, esta heroína humilde descubre que no está sola y con el apoyo, nada desdeñable, de Manuela, la pescadera del barrio, Shamira, una inmigrante africana ilegal, y su querido Ernesto, se enfrenta a unos impresionantes molinos. Gracias a ellos, poco a poco, irá descubriendo su camino y aprendiendo a perdonar a su padre y a reconciliarse consigo misma.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Desde su anonimato, Satur hace cosas que jamás había imaginado, desde su insignificancia consigue logros impensables y aprende, mirando hacia atrás, de los que parecen más desafortunados que ella. Satur nos cuenta una historia de gente buena, de hombres y sobre todo de mujeres, que desde la ignorancia, y sin más protección que la intemperie, mueven la rueda que trae y se lleva todos  los cambios.</p>
<h3>¿Quiénes?</h3>
<p><strong>Tandaia </strong>es una joven editorial con voluntad de cambio, de dar la alternativa a autores que no la encuentran en otro lugar, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el <i>crowdfunding</i>.</p>
<p>De este modo eres tú, ahora que te estás planteando cómo colaborar, el que decide si la obra que te presentamos verá la luz pasando a formar parte de nuestro catálogo... porque consideramos al lector parte fundamental del proceso.</p>
<p>Hoy se nos presenta <strong>Pilar Gutiérrez Garzón</strong>.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Nací en Toledo el 21 de marzo de 1948. Allí fui al Colegio y, más tarde al Instituto donde estudié hasta terminar lo que entonces se llamaba Bachillerato Superior. Inmediatamente después hice oposiciones para la antigua Caja de Ahorros de Toledo, oposición que gané con el número uno. Cuando me casé, me fui a vivir a Madrid y cuatro años después, viví, durante un año y medio, con mis hijos y mi marido en los Estados Unidos.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">De vuelta a Madrid, ejercí de ama de casa y madre hasta que mis hijos crecieron. Entonces, trabajé como voluntaria en dos ONG’s: primero cinco años como responsable del Departamento de Educación en Manos Unidas. Y luego en la Fundación Entreculturas, donde fui responsable, durante nueve años, del Departamento de Servicios Generales.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Al tener más tiempo libre, empecé a escribir. Me matriculé en la Escuela de Escritores de Madrid. Allí he hecho varios cursos: uno de escritura creativa, otro de redacción y estilo, tres de itinerario de novela y, por último y, de momento, uno de escritura dramática. Hasta ahora, he publicado varios relatos y novelas: <i>¿Dónde estás?  </i>(relato publicado en <i>El sueño del Gato, Antología de literatura breve)</i>, <i>Madrid sin él</i> (relato publicado en <i>Queda la música</i>), <i>La Daga</i> (Bubok Publishing, 2014), <i>El sabor de las cerezas</i> (Editorial Onuba, 2015).</p>
<h3>¿Cómo?</h3>
<p>Para arrancar el proyecto nos hemos fijado como objetivo 880€; esta es la cantidad que recaudaríamos si alrededor de cuarenta mecenas se hiciesen, cada cual, con un ejemplar de esta primera edición.</p>
<ul>
<li>Teniendo acceso a las galeradas de edición.</li>
<li>Recibiendo un ejemplar semanas antes de la salida al mercado de la obra.</li>
<li>Si bien, también podrías ver tu nombre en los agradecimientos aportando un poco más.</li>
</ul>
<p>Los fondos recaudados, se utilizarán para sacar adelante esta primera edición de <strong>Aviones de papel </strong>que saldría después a la venta.</p>
<h3>Además...</h3>
<p>Sabemos que son tiempos difíciles, también nosotros los sufrimos, y es posible que no te encuentres en disposición de apoyarnos con tu mecenazgo en estos momentos... pero esperamos que si esto te ha llegado al alma, incluso si tal vez conoces en persona al autor, trates de difundir esta campaña (facebook, twitter, blogger, boca-oreja... ) para que alcancemos nuestra meta y Pilar Gutiérrez Garzón vea publicada esta obra.<br/><br/>Gracias por vuestro tiempo.</p>

«Tenía trece años recién cumplidos y fue la primera vez que me enfrenté a él». Así comienza la historia de Satur, una chica de un pueblo de Toledo que, con toda la inocencia de su niñez, pretende decidir sobre su propia vida. En plena dictadura del general Franco, desafía a su autoritario padre, cuya frase favorita es: «¡No se hable más!». Satur tiene que enfrentarse a siglos de tradición, que le han asignado un papel idéntico al de su madre y al de su abuela, sin más opciones que el sometimiento a una autoridad que había sido otorgada, como decían las monedas, por la gracia de Dios. El choque con la realidad es brutal y Satur acaba viendo pasar su vida desde el chiscón de una portería de la capital.
Satur nos cuenta, con un lenguaje directo y sencillo, su  historia, marcada desde el principio por los enfrentamientos con su padre y por su odio al tabaco, que la llevará a vivir los momentos más trágicos de su vida. A lo largo de la novela, esta heroína humilde descubre que no está sola y con el apoyo, nada desdeñable, de Manuela, la pescadera del barrio, Shamira, una inmigrante africana ilegal, y su querido Ernesto, se enfrenta a unos impresionantes molinos. Gracias a ellos, poco a poco, irá descubriendo su camino y aprendiendo a perdonar a su padre y a reconciliarse consigo misma.
Desde su anonimato, Satur hace cosas que jamás había imaginado, desde su insignificancia consigue logros impensables y aprende, mirando hacia atrás, de los que parecen más desafortunados que ella. Satur nos cuenta una historia de gente buena, de hombres y sobre todo de mujeres, que desde la ignorancia, y sin más protección que la intemperie, mueven la rueda que trae y se lleva todos  los cambios.
¿Quiénes?
Tandaia es una joven editorial con voluntad de cambio, de dar la alternativa a autores que no la encuentran en otro lugar, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el crowdfunding.
De este modo eres tú, ahora que te estás planteando cómo colaborar, el que decide si la obra que te presentamos verá la luz pasando a formar parte de nuestro catálogo... porque consideramos al lector parte fundamental del proceso.
Hoy se nos presenta Pilar Gutiérrez Garzón.
Nací en Toledo el 21 de marzo de 1948. Allí fui al Colegio y, más tarde al Instituto donde estudié hasta terminar lo que entonces se llamaba Bachillerato Superior. Inmediatamente después hice oposiciones para la antigua Caja de Ahorros de Toledo, oposición que gané con el número uno. Cuando me casé, me fui a vivir a Madrid y cuatro años después, viví, durante un año y medio, con mis hijos y mi marido en los Estados Unidos.
De vuelta a Madrid, ejercí de ama de casa y madre hasta que mis hijos crecieron. Entonces, trabajé como voluntaria en dos ONG’s: primero cinco años como responsable del Departamento de Educación en Manos Unidas. Y luego en la Fundación Entreculturas, donde fui responsable, durante nueve años, del Departamento de Servicios Generales.
Al tener más tiempo libre, empecé a escribir. Me matriculé en la Escuela de Escritores de Madrid. Allí he hecho varios cursos: uno de escritura creativa, otro de redacción y estilo, tres de itinerario de novela y, por último y, de momento, uno de escritura dramática. Hasta ahora, he publicado varios relatos y novelas: ¿Dónde estás?  (relato publicado en El sueño del Gato, Antología de literatura breve), Madrid sin él (relato publicado en Queda la música), La Daga (Bubok Publishing, 2014), El sabor de las cerezas (Editorial Onuba, 2015).
¿Cómo?
Para arrancar el proyecto nos hemos fijado como objetivo 880€; esta es la cantidad que recaudaríamos si alrededor de cuarenta mecenas se hiciesen, cada cual, con un ejemplar de esta primera edición.

Teniendo acceso a las galeradas de edición.
Recibiendo un ejemplar semanas antes de la salida al mercado de la obra.
Si bien, también podrías ver tu nombre en los agradecimientos aportando un poco más.

Los fondos recaudados, se utilizarán para sacar adelante esta primera edición de Aviones de papel que saldría después a la venta.
Además...
Sabemos que son tiempos difíciles, también nosotros los sufrimos, y es posible que no te encuentres en disposición de apoyarnos con tu mecenazgo en estos momentos... pero esperamos que si esto te ha llegado al alma, incluso si tal vez conoces en persona al autor, trates de difundir esta campaña (facebook, twitter, blogger, boca-oreja... ) para que alcancemos nuestra meta y Pilar Gutiérrez Garzón vea publicada esta obra.Gracias por vuestro tiempo.",0.0,0,"228 Campaigns

<p>Mi nombre es Catalina Vidal. Vivo por elección en Huéscar
desde hace diez años. Al llegar al territorio por primera vez me enamoró por
sus paisajes, diversos y eclécticos, como reflejo en el libro. Luego
vino la historia local, de una riqueza y relevancia tal que me hizo comprender
con mayor precisión la historia general de este país. Al entrar en contacto con
las personas, estas me transmitieron su visión del territorio; esta tierra es
pobre, fea, y carece de oportunidades de futuro para sus habitantes. Eso me llevó
a reconocer los recursos que tiene, que son quizás demasiados para un
territorio tan pequeño y tan poco poblado. Cuando se tienen muchos recursos,
tanto económicos como endógenos, y está
todo por hacer, el problema está prácticamente resuelto: manos a la obra.  Sin embargo no es así en la realidad. Los
dineros llegan, sobre todo de la UE,
pero los suelen utilizar en actuaciones peregrinas nada prácticas,  con presupuestos inflados, y que además no van
acompañadas de un proyecto de continuidad. Los recursos endógenos solamente
sirven para obtener dinero público, pero no para el aprovechamiento de los mismos
desde un punto de vista laboral y económico que dote al territorio de un futuro viable. </p>
<p>En estos tiempos en que aflora al público la corrupción diariamente,
parece que hablar de corrupción en una comarca poco poblada no es ninguna
novedad ni aporta nada nuevo al panorama de la corrupción. Pero no es así, No
basta con señalar la corrupción, es necesario aportar soluciones una vez
se logre erradicarla. Por otro lado, estoy hablando, no de políticos imputados, que alguno
tenemos por el territorio, más bien del conjunto de las corruptelas de la
comarca, el origen, el desarollo y las consecuencias,  como han influido en el desarrollo del territorio. Si la ciudadanía
las conociera todas: trayectoria, como nos engañan, cuantía, partidos políticos
implicados en ellas, que habría sido de la comarca si las hubieran utilizado el
dinero correctamente para el desarrollo de la comunidad, proporcionando empleos
dignos, cultura, posibilidad de alimentación saludable, mermando el impacto
medio ambiental en la construcción ¿seguría apoyando las politicas actuales o reivindicaria otro rumbo? </p>
<p>Sostenibilidad es una palabra degradada por el mal uso que
se ha hecho de ella desde que comenzó a circular como medida de futuro para equilibrar producción/comercialización/consumo.
Pero para mi sigue estando vigente. La comarca, extraordinariamente dotada de
recursos endógenos, bien podría ser un hito en sostenibilidad real, con el
consiguiente beneficio para el conjunto de la ciudadanía y del medio ambiente,
sin esfuerzos, medidas, ni inversiones adicionales. </p>
<p>Es cierto que las nuevas políticas que parece que se
avecinan tratan en cierto modo la sostenibilidad dándole un nombre nuevo, pero da la sensación de que están en fase abstracta todavía,
y contempladas a nivel global y no personalizado como requiere la
sostenibilidad, pues en cada región los recursos y las necesidades son
diferentes. </p>
<p>En este sentido, las aportaciones que hago en “Comarca de Huéscar:
historia, corrupción, sostenibilidad” pueden ser útiles a la hora de ir configurando la sostenibilidad por territorios. </p>
<p>La financiación que necesita “Comarca de Huéscar: historia,
corrupción, sostenibilidad” es de 7.930 € para la edición de 1.000 ejemplares y
un cálculo, quizás estimado a la baja, para el envío de libros al territorio
español, y un porcentaje mínimo a países europeos y americanos. El valor económico de los
obsequios adjuntos, por supuesto, no se incluyen, ya que en parte han sido
donados con ese objeto, o pertenecen a mi propio fondo de piezas artesanales de
tapices y pequeños objetos artesanales de producción propia. Tampoco el diseño de
la portada del libro, ni de los marca páginas que acompañan al libro, pues han sido diseñados por colaboradoras del proyecto del libro. </p>
<p>Es la primera vez que escribo un libro, aunque desde hace
años he publicado artículos y columnas de crítica política y social local en
blog y foros, que han tenido una relativa trascendencia. Pero en este caso,
estoy ""muerta"" de miedo, pues me asaltan dudas respecto a si habré incluido todo
lo relevante y lo habré hecho de forma coherente y comprensible. Quienes han
tenido acceso a parte de los textos dicen que se trata de un trabajo de
investigación periodística, rigurosa, 
minuciosa y de calidad. </p>
<p>Es cierto que he puesto todo el empeño en reflejar la
realidad tal cual es, pues es fundamental para que se pueda poner en marcha un
proyecto de desarrollo sostenible integral para la comarca, que supondría la
salida de la miseria en la que se encuentra inmersa, proporcionando empleos
dignos, un exquisito cuidado al medio ambiente del territorio, y una
alimentación sana para el conjunto de la población. </p>
<p>El objetivo de ""Comarca de Huéscar: historia, corrupción,
sostenibilidad"", es que llegue a un gran número de personas en el territorio,
para que, a través del conocimiento de su territorio, de su historia, de
quienes nos gobiernan, y de los recursos endógenos que disponemos, se sacudan
el complejo de inferioridad global que los constriñe y que fundamenten el
futuro no en base a promesas vacías, sino en realidades viables. </p>
<p>Por otro lado, la radiografía de esta comarca, la
estructura, las fuentes sobre las que se fundamenta, pueden ser igualmente útiles
para cualquier otra comarca que arrastre desempleo y despoblación, aplicando
para su desarrollo el reconocimiento y valorización de sus propios recursos. </p>
<p>Ignoro cual puede ser el grado de aceptación de este libro,
cuantas personas podrán estar interesadas en su lectura. Me gustaría, no ya que
fuesen mil, sino miles, pues eso significaría, de entrada, que ese número de
personas, tienen interés en el futuro de sus pueblos y en participar
activamente en el desarrollo del mismo. Las propuestas que indico en el libro
pueden ampliarse con otras aportaciones que a mi se me han escapado e
igualmente pueden servir como punto de partida para otras experiencias en otros
territorios. Hay que pensar que, en el caso de que se implantaran
generalizadamente en este país, o en cualquier otro, se habrían resuelto graves
problemas actuales de desempleo, pobreza, emigración, energía, medio ambiente, y
en una pequeña parte, cambio climático. Por eso es tan importante para mí la
difusión de este libro. </p>
<p>Aunque, he de reconocer, que si bien me vuelco totalmente en
defender las posibilidades reales de sostenibilidades locales comunitarias que solucionarían
graves problemas de distinta índole, no estoy capacitada para venderme a mi
misma, es decir, para promocionarme individualmente, Nunca he sido buena en ese
aspecto. Por lo tanto, no se que grado de éxito pueda tener en este sentido. </p>
<p>La colaboración de personas que me desconocen por completo,
y que de la obra a publicar únicamente saben 
lo que apunto sobre ella, no solamente pueden participar económicamente,
que es importantísimo, sino que también pueden hacerlo en un grado similar de
importancia, de estar interesadas en el tema, difundiendo la campaña de
recaudación para la impresión y distribución del libro. Y, sobre todo, leyendo
el libro, por la posibilidad que puede tener para que aporte ideas en
sostenibilidad práctica para aplicarlas en sus territorios. </p>

<h3>Thinking <i>Lateral</i>-ly</h3>
<p>Science increasingly dominates every aspect of our lives, and many people now realise the importance of properly communicating new research to the public.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But let's be honest: for all the current enthusiasm around the communication of science, there aren't a lot of opportunities for young scientists and journalists to hone their writing skills in an editorial environment. Writing for a personal blog, while useful and rewarding, usually doesn't prepare you for a world of deadlines and editorial demands. Plus, at the end of the day, it's hard to put blogging on your resumé.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435246226/r9xpohdzpndqt4ukdiwq.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>Lateral</i> was designed to help fill this gap, bringing new voices and artists to the science media landscape - while also being a fantastic publication that will appeal to a wide audience, many of them also younger people. It will also pay all of its contributors, a rarity in the modern media landscape for younger writers and artists.</p>The Young Australian Skeptics is proud to be bringing <i>Lateral</i> into the world as part of its mission to improve science communication to and from young people. Since 2008, the YAS has been publishing online articles on its eclectic group blog, has produced hundreds of hours of audio on two science and critical thinking-themed podcasts, <i><a href=""http://youngausskeptics.com/podcasts/the-pseudoscientists"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Pseudoscientists</a></i> and <i><a href=""http://youngausskeptics.com/podcasts/unfiltered-thoughts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Unfiltered Thoughts</a></i>, and published the <i>Skeptical Blog Anthology</i> (2012), a collection of some of the Internet's best writing on science and skepticism.  And don't worry - we're not climate change deniers.<p></p>
<h3>The Virtues of Crowdfunding</h3>
<h4>Why Do We Need All This Money?</h4>
<p>Reimbursing our writers and artists for their time and effort is one of our top priorities – too many opportunities for new science communicators are unpaid, and we're bucking that trend. We're also designing <i>Lateral</i> with the fantastic team of young web developers over at <a href=""http://www.designgel.org.nz/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">DesignGel</a>, who need to be paid. Our crowdfunding goal covers these costs of design, as well as providing funds for our first 6 months of articles and magazine content.</p>
<p>The cost of designing <i>Lateral</i> is $3,600, and 6 months of contributor payments, based on our planned publication frequency, is a little over $4,500. The headroom in our initial goal is to allow for the gradual expansion of the number of columns in the magazine, buffer against processing fees incurred during this campaign, and other, smaller initial website management costs. </p>
<p></p>
<h4>What Do You Get Out of It?</h4>
<p>You'd think helping to bring a new publication to life from the depths of imagination would be reward enough ‒ but no, there's other stuff you can get if you support <i>Lateral</i>'s creation. We thought long and hard about these perks, and realised that if you're willing to support a science communication magazine, you'd probably love to get involved somehow, rather than claim a low-quality, mass-produced t-shirt.</p>
<p>So, based on your contribution, you can <b>sponsor an article</b> or even <b>an entire column for a whole year</b>! Whoa. For those who want to get even more direct, you can <b>commission an article about a topic of your choosing</b> or <b>choose an entire future month's theme</b>. You'd be like a god. A science writing god. We're even throwing a launch party in Melbourne for those of you who want to meet us all in person: truly the greatest gift of all.</p>
<h4>But What If...?</h4>
<p>If we reach over 100% of our $10,000 goal, we've got some great ideas about how we would use such a generous outpouring of support, other than investing solely in future month-by-month operating costs of the magazine:</p>
<p><b>$15,000</b>: If we reach 150% funding, we'll commission unique artwork for all of our articles, not just our featured themed articles. That's more gorgeous science-inspired artwork every month. Fantastic. </p>
<p><b>$20,000</b>: 200% funded means at least more 5 more articles per month, all with unique artwork! Damn.</p>
<p><b>$30,000</b>: If we're lucky enough to receive 300% of our goal, we'll create a podcast companion based on the magazine, exploring the relationship between science and society in greater detail, in the way only audio can. This would launch <i>Lateral</i> into the multimedia sphere, supporting the development of the podcast and radio skills of emerging science communicators, not just their written and artistic abilities. </p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks? Challenges?</h3> <p>As of the launch of this crowdfunding campaign, we've already planned the first month of articles and much of it is currently being written. There's a clear and on-target web design timeline as well, leading to the launch of <i>Lateral</i> on the 3rd of August. Everyone involved, from our editorial team, to our present and future contributors, to our designers, is super keen about the project and we're all working hard to make the magazine as polished and exciting as possible for you, our audience, to finally read and enjoy. </p>
<p>Once the magazine has been initially funded, the only significant challenge to the future of <i>Lateral</i> will be maintaining a funding stream without commercial advertising, either through audience support via a platform such as <a href=""https://www.patreon.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Patreon</a>, and/or ongoing partnerships with likeminded scientific organisations. This campaign gives us the breathing room required to settle on a model that keeps the magazine free to read, but allows us to continue to pay contributors for their time and effort. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you can't pledge money towards our goal, that's totally fine, we understand. But helping get the word out there about <i>Lateral</i> is, in many ways, more helpful! Tell your friends, family, extremely-casual acquaintances: who knows, you might help them discover a new interest in science.</p>
<p>But most important, really, is to keep your eyes peeled for <i>Lateral</i>'s grand launch in August! We've already got great stuff lined up for you to read and we can't wait to share it with you all. </p>
</div></div>","What's All This? Lateral is an online magazine focused on the interaction of science with wider human society, including medicine, the media, philosophy, law, education, history, politics, art, culture, and more. Through publication, it will soon create paid opportunities for up-and-coming young science communicators and artists, and engage a wide audience with the ideas and value of science.
In other words, Lateral is a great, free science magazine that everyone can enjoy, put together by the next generation of scientific and creative minds, launching in early August. Interested?
Our writing and editorial team is made up of young people with backgrounds in scientific research and communications from Australia and around the world. We know there are great science stories waiting to be told by young people, and we want to provide these aspiring writers and communicators with an outlet for their unique voices and outlooks, all while building a compelling and original magazine for our readers.
Lateral is a project of the Young Australian Skeptics, a group that has supported the exploration of science, critical thinking, pseudoscience, philosophy, education and youth issues through online writing and podcasting since 2008.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Anthony Colson, I am a father of a 5 year old son, and I am a resident of Houston, Tx, and I grew up wanting more of God. I attend Houston Worship Centre, in Houston, Tx, under Senior Pastor Randy Needham. I am a graduate of All Nations School of Ministry (<a href=""http://www.allnations.cc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.allnations.cc</a>), and I assist my Young Adults Pastor with 232, our young adults ministry, and with Revival Generation. I am beginning to write and blog online at <a href=""http://www.anthonycolson.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.anthonycolson.com</a>.  am also a server at Tommy Bahama’s in The Woodlands.</p>
<p>This IndieGoGo campaign is the beginning of something that will have such a powerful impact. The publication of this book isn’t the end all, but the beginning of a powerful writing series that will show the power and beauty of salvation and a life lived with Jesus that I have yet found put to paper.</p>
<p>Through partnering with me in the publication of <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Experiencing Salvation, </span> you will assist me in being able to minister the passionate love of God to those who have never heard it expressed as it is in this book. This is not another book talking about how to cope with despair until Jesus comes, but a beacon of hope and an answer to the personal cry of my heart on what it means to be truly saved and live passionately for one who gave His life for each one of us.  I write about the freedoms of living with an identity that took all the strength of God to create for every person who will ever live. This book ignites the heart, because in it I tell you, the reader, what it means to live as one so passionately loved, and how to live as one passionately loved by the Father of Jesus who is love.</p>
<p>Partner with me to get this book published.</p>

Everything above that will go to printing more books, and provide me the ability to spend more time on the book campaign itself. The book is going to be published through High Bridge Books, and will be available in paperback and all the popular ebook formats.</p>
<p> I want it to be easy to partner and help support this project. I really want to get this funded with a lot of people giving what may not seem like much and getting something that will powerfully help them in return.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Publishing this book and getting it done in English will pave the way for the book to be distributed not only in the United States, but English speaking countries all over the world. This campaigns success will mean this book will not only be published and capable of impacting the hearts of the lost and broken, and downtrodden here, but also pave the way for the book’s translation into Spanish, Russian, Mandarin and a host of different languages. This book will open the hearts of people to Jesus, all over the world. However, it first has to be published.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please point people toward this campaign. Those you may know that need a message like this, point them this direction. Also, please use the IndieGoGo share tools to help spread the message!</p>

 I want it to be easy to partner and help support this project. I really want to get this funded with a lot of people giving what may not seem like much and getting something that will powerfully help them in return.
So I have some giving levels.
$25 The “One for Anyone” package

A free signed copy upon book release
A free pdf version sampling of three chapters to whet your appetite
A free audio download of me ministering on the chapter “Joy of Repentance”

 
$100 The “Excited About This” package

Five (5) free signed copies upon book release, enough for the average family
A free pdf version of the complete book
Additional audio downloads, on the chapters, “So Much More,” “The Armor of God.”

$250 The “I Have Been Waiting This” package

Twelve (12) free signed copies upon book release, for the office or bible study
A free pdf version of the complete book
Additional audio download on the chapter “Born of Heaven”
Free video downloads consisting of a “Fire side chat,” on the various chapters and topics of the book, what went into writing, and how the book has changed me personally. Also, interviewed with the various editors, and some of the behind the scenes conversations that most people just do not get to have.

 
 
As far as delivery on the perks.

The Free PDFs will be available within 48 hours of donation. I don’t want you to be waiting for everything.
The books will be available on within ten days of my receiving the finished copies. Which I plan to be 60 days after the campaign is over.
The free audio and video downloads will be available by July 25th 2013.

I will need your shipping address as well as email address. All the correspondence I send out via email will come from my personal blogsite, www.anthonycolson.com.
Thank you!
 


The Impact
Publishing this book and getting it done in English will pave the way for the book to be distributed not only in the United States, but English speaking countries all over the world. This campaigns success will mean this book will not only be published and capable of impacting the hearts of the lost and broken, and downtrodden here, but also pave the way for the book’s translation into Spanish, Russian, Mandarin and a host of different languages. This book will open the hearts of people to Jesus, all over the world. However, it first has to be published.

</h1> <p></p>
<p>Outbreak. The word spawns chills and premonitions
of hacking coughs, boils, oozing sores
and death. Emerging viruses in the Middle East or East Asia,
such as MERS and H7N9, are certainly frightening, but how does the
coverage by outsider media compare to the sentiments of those reporting from
ground zero of an epidemic?</p>
<p>This story concept spawned from a conversation that I once
had about the taboos instilled against certain regions by global
news coverage of infectious disease outbreaks. </p>
<p>Together, because this is an Open Project, we’ll investigate
whether that’s true and much more. I will conduct multiple rounds of interviews
to see how reporter perceptions’ evolve during an outbreak and after it has
‘resolved’ (either lost media steam or stopped spreading). </p>
<p>I will interview journalists and bloggers living near the
epicenter of an outbreak and compare their views with those
covering the situation from abroad. The current
Ebola outbreak will be the ideal case study.</p>

The 88 bed-facility set up by ECHO partner Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is full to capacity. In the same region, another ECHO partner, the Red Cross and its network of volunteers engage in another crucial task, namely social mobilisation, contact tracing and body management. 4 in 10 Ebola sufferers recover from the lethal disease and try to pick what's left of their lives in a region now cordoned off from the world.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>I’m setting the bar at $1,000, but the
proceeds will be divided evenly between three health organizations working in
West Africa.</p>
<p>We’ll take submissions for possible
organizations, and we’ll create an open survey so people can vote on where the
money should go.</p>
<p>Every two weeks I’ll publish a story
spotlighting a handful of different journalists. My prospective list is below.
Feel free to suggest folks from across the globe.</p>
<p>This story will last as long as the
outbreak (or longer if the people want me to continue).</p>

<h3>The Story Depends on You</h3>
<p>Outbreak Abroad is the 2nd  installment of #OpenSciLogs, a <a href=""http://www.scilogs.com/from_the_lab_bench/openscilogs-an-experiment-in-crowd-funded-open-participatory-science-journalism-2/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">new project at SciLogs.com</a> designed to introduce <b>crowd-funded, open, participatory science reporting</b> to the science blogosphere and beyond.</p>
<p>This #OpenSciLogs story project depends upon YOUR participation, and the participation of other science writers and readers. This story will feature regular blog updates at Nsikan's SciLogs.com blog, <a href=""http://www.scilogs.com/thats_basic_science/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">That's Basic Science</a>, social media conversations (follow the hashtag #OpenSciLogs), and most importantly <a href=""https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B0uOD0uKxuj0bFZLWmpsYmRIZE0&amp;usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">a public and editable Google Doc and interview files</a>.</p>
<p>Nsikan plans to help you participate in this story by providing you with all of his raw materials: transcripts of his interviews with journalists and editors, raw notes, raw data, etc. You can also make changes to the ongoing story in real time on this <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TvfjQWnuJstAKqOsKHeHZi6irB-oCsPto0GwzprDye4/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Google Doc</a>.

<p>Science blogs and other new digital and social media platforms for science writing are exploding while in-depth traditional media coverage of science, especially investigative science journalism, suffers. Unfortunately, many science bloggers and science writers for new digital media outlets go unpaid or underpaid. How can we help fund high quality science reporting “from the ground up,” in a way that prompts scientists and science writers in digital and social media environments - including the science blogosphere - to participate collectively in creating more in-depth science journalism across the web?</p>
<p>This is where OpenSciLogs hopes to come in. <b>The idea of OpenSciLogs is to combine crowd-funding with an “open notebook” and participatory approach to science writing, to produce in-depth science reporting from the ground up.</b> By the ground up, we mean an ongoing science journalism process that starts in the science blogosphere, at SciLogs.com for now, and continues on to produce in-depth science storytelling in other nontraditional and traditional science media outlets across the web.</p>
<p>In an effort to encourage open participation in a science storytelling process that transcends the individual science writer and the individual science blog, this project also embodies an “open notebook” approach to in-depth science reporting. The “open notebook” approach involves full disclosure and public publishing of raw story materials, a focus on science research published in open access mediums, and encouraging scientific story sources to provide their contact information for follow-up coverage of the story. In other words, each blogger leading an OpenSciLogs story project will both be joined by other science writers and readers in the investigation and writing of the story, and supply everything another science blogger, journalist or media outlet would need to fact-check and continue the story. </p>
<p>The conversation around each OpenSciLogs story project is meant to be open, and other journalists and bloggers should feel free to take the story to their own blogs, news sites, etc. By engaging readers and encouraging other science readers and writers to take the story in directions that interest them, OpenSciLogs’ bloggers will hopefully motivate others to participate actively in the story. <i>Each #OpenSciLogs story project will be a living, breathing investigation into an important topic in science or science communication, published under a Creative Commons license.

Outbreak. The word spawns chills and premonitions
of hacking coughs, boils, oozing sores
and death. Emerging viruses in the Middle East or East Asia,
such as MERS and H7N9, are certainly frightening, but how does the
coverage by outsider media compare to the sentiments of those reporting from
ground zero of an epidemic?
This story concept spawned from a conversation that I once
had about the taboos instilled against certain regions by global
news coverage of infectious disease outbreaks. 
Together, because this is an Open Project, we’ll investigate
whether that’s true and much more. I will conduct multiple rounds of interviews
to see how reporter perceptions’ evolve during an outbreak and after it has
‘resolved’ (either lost media steam or stopped spreading). 
I will interview journalists and bloggers living near the
epicenter of an outbreak and compare their views with those
covering the situation from abroad. The current
Ebola outbreak will be the ideal case study.

The fight against Ebola in West Africa, by European Commission DG ECHO Flickr Image: 4 months after the first case of Ebola was confirmed in Guinea, more than 1200
people have been infected across 3 West African countries. This biggest Ebola
outbreak ever recorded requires an intensification of efforts to avoid it from
spreading further and claiming many more lives. Photo credits:

Sierra Leone, into the Ebola epicentre, by European Commission DG ECHO Flickr Image: As one of the Ebola epicentres, the district of Kailahun, in eastern Sierra Leone bordering Guinea, was put under quarantine at the beginning of August. ECHO expert Cyprien Fabre visited the distrtict which is home to the largest Ebola treatment and isolation centre ever erected. The 88 bed-facility set up by ECHO partner Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is full to capacity. In the same region, another ECHO partner, the Red Cross and its network of volunteers engage in another crucial task, namely social mobilisation, contact tracing and body management. 4 in 10 Ebola sufferers recover from the lethal disease and try to pick what's left of their lives in a region now cordoned off from the world.

What We Need & What You Get 
I’m setting the bar at $1,000, but the
proceeds will be divided evenly between three health organizations working in
West Africa.
We’ll take submissions for possible
organizations, and we’ll create an open survey so people can vote on where the
money should go.
Every two weeks I’ll publish a story
spotlighting a handful of different journalists. My prospective list is below.
Feel free to suggest folks from across the globe.
This story will last as long as the
outbreak (or longer if the people want me to continue).

Reach Goals
SciLogs.com (managed by team member Paige Brown Jarreau) is also setting reach goals as follows:



If we exceed our goal (>$1,000) then a portion of proceeds not to exceed $500 will go toward thanking our sponsor science magazine Spektrum der Wissenschaft, and thanking Nsikan for his time and volunteered reporting. 

If we exceed $2000, funds not to exceed $500 will go toward paying for an extra month or more of in-depth regular Ebola reporting and Ebola media critiques at SciLogs.com, reported by invited guest freelance journalists and bloggers.




  
  

The Story Depends on You
Outbreak Abroad is the 2nd  installment of #OpenSciLogs, a new project at SciLogs.com designed to introduce crowd-funded, open, participatory science reporting to the science blogosphere and beyond.
This #OpenSciLogs story project depends upon YOUR participation, and the participation of other science writers and readers. This story will feature regular blog updates at Nsikan's SciLogs.com blog, That's Basic Science, social media conversations (follow the hashtag #OpenSciLogs), and most importantly a public and editable Google Doc and interview files.
Nsikan plans to help you participate in this story by providing you with all of his raw materials: transcripts of his interviews with journalists and editors, raw notes, raw data, etc. You can also make changes to the ongoing story in real time on this Google Doc. Nsikan also encourages you to provide comments on the story through the Google Doc and his blog post updates. And that's not all: all #OpenSciLogs content is published under a Creative Commons license, meaning you take and continue the story wherever you would like.

</ul>
<p>Hi! I'm Leslie Starr O'Hara. I'm a mom and an audiobook producer living in the mountains of North Carolina, and I love to write science fiction and fantasy. A few years back I decided that writing was what I really wanted to do. I'd always been told I had a natural talent for it, and I would constantly make up stories in my head, and write them down just for fun. Throughout my life, writing has been creatively fulfilling for me. But I wanted and needed to be a better writer. It was not enough just to write. I had to write stories that people would fall in love with, that would keep them hooked until the very last page. And I didn't know how to do that.<br/></p>
<p>So I dedicated a lot of focus and time and energy to learning how to do it. I have worked really hard over the past few years to improve my writing skills, through study of story-craft, in addition to lots of writing, revising, writing, revising and more writing. Last year, I completed <a href=""http://nanowrimo.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">NaNoWriMo</a> (National Novel Writer's Month) for the first time. Basically that means that I wrote 50,000 words in 30 days towards the completion of a novel. I got the novel about halfway done during NaNo (it's a long novel told in three separate points of view) and that really contributed to my growth as a writer. I feel like I've made immense strides, and sort of like I'm tottering on the brink of a major epiphany, where all the bits and pieces I've learned and practiced fall into place and my fiction takes off like a rocket.</p>

</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>Like any great venture, there are some very real challenges that come along with this opportunity. They are:<br/><ul>
<li>I will be away from my family, and specifically my nine-year-old, for six weeks. I have never been away from my child for that long, and it will be emotionally hard for me, but even more so for her. Additionally, I will not be at home during the summer months to provide care for her while her dad is at work full-time. Fortunately, my family believes in me and is being amazingly supportive. My husband is confident that we can make it work with the help of grandparents and day camps, and my daughter says that she is really proud of me and wants me to go more than she wants me to stay.</li>
<li>The workshop is going to be extremely intensive, and at times, grueling. I know this. In addition to writing one short story a week (if you've ever written a short story, and you're not a time jumper, you probably know that this in itself is quite a feat), I will also be reading and critiquing the stories all the other students turn in, and doing class readings, discussions and writing exercises. As one Odyssey alumnus wrote: ""The experience was harrowing and thrilling all at once—the intensive
workshop combined with mind-bending lectures on craft meant I fell asleep every
night with my head spinning. Sometimes I cried. Sometimes I wanted to go home.
Sometimes I thought, <i>This is the most fun
I’ve ever had.</i>"" I am prepared for this. I know it will be hard, but I can handle it. I am, after all, the mother of a nine-year-old.</li>

The campaign is now successfully funded! A huge, appreciative robot hug goes out to all who supported it through financial contributions, social media shares and kind words of encouragement. I am so pleased and thrilled to be able to seize this dream opportunity to go to Odyssey Writing Workshop, and I couldn't have done it without all of you! 
The campaign will still be active through Saturday, April 4 at 11:59 PT. Any additional funds raised will go toward feeding me while I am at the workshop. There are still several rad perks available, so tell your friends! 

Short Summary
Before I introduce myself and explain the campaign, here are some pertinent links that will give you a better idea of what you're investing in, if you choose to contribute.

My Blog

The writing sample (a chapter from my novel in progress) that got me accepted to Odyssey Writing Workshop

Hi! I'm Leslie Starr O'Hara. I'm a mom and an audiobook producer living in the mountains of North Carolina, and I love to write science fiction and fantasy. A few years back I decided that writing was what I really wanted to do. I'd always been told I had a natural talent for it, and I would constantly make up stories in my head, and write them down just for fun. Throughout my life, writing has been creatively fulfilling for me. But I wanted and needed to be a better writer. It was not enough just to write. I had to write stories that people would fall in love with, that would keep them hooked until the very last page. And I didn't know how to do that.
So I dedicated a lot of focus and time and energy to learning how to do it. I have worked really hard over the past few years to improve my writing skills, through study of story-craft, in addition to lots of writing, revising, writing, revising and more writing. Last year, I completed NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writer's Month) for the first time. Basically that means that I wrote 50,000 words in 30 days towards the completion of a novel. I got the novel about halfway done during NaNo (it's a long novel told in three separate points of view) and that really contributed to my growth as a writer. I feel like I've made immense strides, and sort of like I'm tottering on the brink of a major epiphany, where all the bits and pieces I've learned and practiced fall into place and my fiction takes off like a rocket.


Earlier this year, I applied to Odyssey Writing Workshop, one of the most highly regarded workshops in the world for writers of science fiction, fantasy and horror. The workshop is a six-week, intensive residential program held annually at Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire, and taught by Jeanne Cavelos, a former editor with decades of experience in helping authors improve their work. 
I really did not expect to get in, because I knew that the competition was stiff, and that there would be a lot of really talented writers applying. So it came as a pleasant (amazing, spine-tingling, heart-thumping) surprise when, on February 28, I received an acceptance letter from the workshop! I feel so honored and humbled to be included in this year's group of 16 up and coming speculative fiction writers at Odyssey, and to learn from some truly great writers, like Kij Johnson and Alex Hughes. This is the opportunity of a lifetime for me. 
But I need help to get there. The workshop is not cheap, but it is, in my opinion, priced far below the immense value I will receive from it. Bottom line is, I do not have the money immediately at my disposal to pay for my travel to and attendance at the workshop. So I hope you'll consider pitching in a few bucks to help me achieve my goal. In return, I'm offering some pretty cool perks to sweeten the deal. Read on to learn more!

  Cost Breakdown 
 Here's how the $3500 breaks down:

$2181 for tuition and required text
$864 for on-campus lodging
$455 for round-trip air travel to the workshop from Asheville, NC (that was the lowest price when I checked multiple sites on March 3.)

There are a few scholarships available, as well, but I have no guarantee of getting them, and won't know if I've received one until very shortly before the final tuition and housing payments are due. So it's definitely not something I can rely on. 


If the entire goal is not reached, the funds raised will still be used to help send me to Odyssey. I do not know how I would come up with the remaining funds, but if it comes to that, I will find a way or conjure one. I WILL go to Odyssey. This is way too important to let little setbacks get in the way.On the other hand, if the campaign exceeds its goal, the excess funds will be used to pay for my nutritional sustenance while I am at Odyssey and/or missed income while I am away.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h1>Who Are You?</h1>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">It may not seem like much of a question, but as I've learned over the course my own life, it is in fact, one of the most fundamental questions one can ask themselves.</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">My name is Karry L. Dayton, I am writer of sorts, a philosopher as well and very, very opinionated. I published a fictional work of philosophy called <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17914451-saint-horz---the-stone-saint"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""saintHorz"">Saint Horz: The Stone Saint</a> two years ago, for those that had read it, it seems well received. Only, it was complex and required a very specific starting point.</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">The Constitution for a Fifth Grader starts from the beginning. It starts with defining the concept of ""You"" and from there travels down the rabbit hole of philosophy to illuminate how exactly this intrinsic definition of self was lost and later overthrown by the lie of self-sacrifice.</div>
<h3>Why Constitution for a Fifth Grader?</h3>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">The idea of a book being directed at a younger crowd, I have to give credit to Ludwig Von Mises in his work called <i><a href=""http://goo.gl/4dg8oG"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Socialism</a></i>. He mentions that he does not expect to have the ability to influence the current intellectuals that dominate thought, but in his optimism, he reminds us that there is always a new generation coming up. Then there were things like; Judge Andrew Napolitano's work on Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt. In that book he suggests that Wilson instituted the public school system not simply as a method of educating children, for there were already schools, but as a way to indoctrinate them to a social view outside their current parent controlled idealism; specifically in opposition to Catholicism. Then there are all the objective views that we see often: <i>Are you Smarter than a Fifth Grader</i> for example. And then, as I was coming up with the name of this work, I got an email from the White House Press Corps, implying that the President wants to thank his fifth grader teacher for her help in shaping the man he had become. It was settled then: Fifth Grade is the moment when the heavy hand of socialism (collectivism) starts to really take hold and that point in our revolution that we must begin the conversation.</div>
<h3>Why this book?</h3>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">This book begins as follows:<blockquote style=""font-style: italic; width: 450px;"">This book is intentionally subversion. It is rebellion. It is revolt. You have been living in absence of revolution.</blockquote> It is true. You and I so long ago, by our births, have been living under a socialism so well ingrained so deeply part of our psyche, that we were incapable of even noticing that we were living by it. I remember reading <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2122.The_Fountainhead?from_search=true&amp;search_version=service_impr"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""saintHorz"">The Fountainhead</a> by Ayn Rand and loving the book, but not really understanding Howard Roark's character. He seemed so distant, so, as the ugly truth of socialism requires, selfish and self absorbed. Yet, I sensed, that something about his character was absolutely natural and correct. It wasn't until I read a lot more and could break the paradigm established by public schools and the media, that I was able to see that Howard wasn't the odd ball, but it was the system he had to work under that was utterly broken. He saw it was broken, thus, refusing to even acknowledge or comply; he did things by is own nature. He was the first fictional character I'd ever read whom lived by his own motive power.</div>

<h3>Thank you</h3><div>As one final note. I'm an Objectivist, a Capitalist, and expect to only do business with others based on the voluntary exchange of goods or service. Because of this, I'm stating simply, do not buy this book to 'help' me. Buy it because you want it, because you have a desire to look beyond the collective, beyond the socialism both large and small. That you want something; sense that something is fundamentally wrong with the current state of affairs and that you want information, greedily. You hunger and want to know the how and the why. </div></div>","Who Are You?
It may not seem like much of a question, but as I've learned over the course my own life, it is in fact, one of the most fundamental questions one can ask themselves.
My name is Karry L. Dayton, I am writer of sorts, a philosopher as well and very, very opinionated. I published a fictional work of philosophy called Saint Horz: The Stone Saint two years ago, for those that had read it, it seems well received. Only, it was complex and required a very specific starting point.
The Constitution for a Fifth Grader starts from the beginning. It starts with defining the concept of ""You"" and from there travels down the rabbit hole of philosophy to illuminate how exactly this intrinsic definition of self was lost and later overthrown by the lie of self-sacrifice.
Why Constitution for a Fifth Grader?
The idea of a book being directed at a younger crowd, I have to give credit to Ludwig Von Mises in his work called Socialism. He mentions that he does not expect to have the ability to influence the current intellectuals that dominate thought, but in his optimism, he reminds us that there is always a new generation coming up. Then there were things like; Judge Andrew Napolitano's work on Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt. In that book he suggests that Wilson instituted the public school system not simply as a method of educating children, for there were already schools, but as a way to indoctrinate them to a social view outside their current parent controlled idealism; specifically in opposition to Catholicism. Then there are all the objective views that we see often: Are you Smarter than a Fifth Grader for example. And then, as I was coming up with the name of this work, I got an email from the White House Press Corps, implying that the President wants to thank his fifth grader teacher for her help in shaping the man he had become. It was settled then: Fifth Grade is the moment when the heavy hand of socialism (collectivism) starts to really take hold and that point in our revolution that we must begin the conversation.
Why this book?
This book begins as follows:This book is intentionally subversion. It is rebellion. It is revolt. You have been living in absence of revolution. It is true. You and I so long ago, by our births, have been living under a socialism so well ingrained so deeply part of our psyche, that we were incapable of even noticing that we were living by it. I remember reading The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand and loving the book, but not really understanding Howard Roark's character. He seemed so distant, so, as the ugly truth of socialism requires, selfish and self absorbed. Yet, I sensed, that something about his character was absolutely natural and correct. It wasn't until I read a lot more and could break the paradigm established by public schools and the media, that I was able to see that Howard wasn't the odd ball, but it was the system he had to work under that was utterly broken. He saw it was broken, thus, refusing to even acknowledge or comply; he did things by is own nature. He was the first fictional character I'd ever read whom lived by his own motive power.

As that cinema rose to global prominence, Cheshire covered the story not only from New York and numerous international festivals, but also during several extended visits to Iran. His writings, which appeared in publications including the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Variety</i>, <i>Film Comment</i>, <i>Cineaste</i>, <i>Sight &amp; Sound</i>, <i>Cinema Scope</i> and the <i>Village Voice</i>, and for DVDs released by the <a href=""https://www.criterion.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Criterion Collection</a>, <a href=""https://www.firstrunfeatures.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">First Run Features</a> and <a href=""https://www.kinolorber.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kino Lorber</a>, established him as the leading authority on Iranian cinema among U.S. critics.</p><p>For Godfrey Cheshire, following Iranian filmmaking has not only entailed writing widely about it and studying its basis in Persian culture, but also an ongoing series of personal excursions and adventures. Cheshire was with Abbas Kiarostami when he won the Palme d’Or at Cannes and the Silver Lion at Venice. Kiarostami took Cheshire on a pilgrimage to the site of his “Koker Trilogy,” during a summer when the critic became the first U.S. journalist since the Iranian Revolution to rent an apartment and live in Tehran. When Godfrey wrote in the New York Times about director Dariush Mehjrui making a film from J.D. Salinger’s “Franny and Zooey,” and Salinger threatened to send marshals to Lincoln Center to seize the film, Cheshire and the film’s star, Niki Karimi, made public appeals to the author. After helping organize exchanges of U.S. and Iranian film artists, Godfrey accompanied director Michael Almereyda to Tehran, where the filmmaker unknowingly took photos of the site of a recent terrorist attack; the action got both Americans hauled to an Iranian police station, from which they were rescued by Iranian producers who were trying to stage Iran’s Oscars the very same night.</p><p>IN THE TIME OF KIAROSTAMI: WRITINGS ON IRANIAN CINEMA collects many of the pieces Cheshire has written over the years, along with new writings, to present a detailed, prismatic set of reflections on that cinema from its beginnings until now. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495658716/u43nkyw90naenmc8cvjb.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495227022/gtq7nlltxbjhj0t08j2r.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><p>Godfrey says, “Crowd-funding is a great way to launch a project like IN THE TIME OF KIAROSTAMI: WRITINGS ON IRANIAN CINEMA.

These movies give us a much different picture of Iranians than the toxic, hostile image presented by the news media. I still think Iranian cinema not only can make Americans think about the lack of humane values in many of our films, but also can help create the kind of understanding needed to head off conflicts between Iran and the U.S. – a danger that right now seems all too real.”</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495221813/iruzrwdcnwcsc8t2uopv.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495220787/zigncr9xyh7mm6jh4l2t.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>We appreciate all contributions to the campaign of any size, and we hope you will let friends and family know about it.

I really appreciate all the interest many people have already shown, and I look forward to expanding the project’s circle of friends as we go forward.”We’re very excited to invite you to join our campaign and a team that, besides Godfrey, includes editor Jim Colvill, design and social media director Miguel Gesso, and editorial/media assistant Tania Ahmadi, and, starting late June, campaign manager Sujewa Ekanayake.  The monies raised by the campaign will be used to fund editing and design; the remaining writing; assorted expenses including travel, research, translation;  as well as printing, publication and publicity.  IN THE TIME OF KIAROSTAMI: WRITINGS ON IRANIAN CINEMA will be a sewn-bound hardcover that uses only the best quality printing and binding materials to create a handsome and durable edition.The contents will include: “My Journey with Iranian Cinema,” Godfrey’s personal overview of his long involvement with Iran and its remarkable film culture; “First Encounter,” his ground-breaking 1993 Film Comment article that initiated his study of Iranian cinema; “Inside the Islamic Republic,” reports on several visits to Iran from 1997 to 2017; “The Backstory,” a history of Iranian cinema from 1900 till Close-Up; “Abbas Kiarostami, Cine-master,” detailed explorations of many of the films that made this director one of the most acclaimed in cinema history, as well as accounts of Godfrey’s interactions with him; “Directors and Films,” profiles and reviews of artists including Dariush Mehrjui, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, Jafar Panahi, Asghar Farhadi, Mohammad Rasoulof, Majid Majidi, Bahman Ghobadi and others; “Aspects of Iranian Cinema” reports and essays on topics including Ebrahim Golestan and The House Is Black; cinema pioneers Fereydoun Hoveyda and Farokh Ghaffary; the tradition of Iranian films about children, and others. And more.This book will be not just an authoritative look at numerous important Iranian films and filmmakers but, additionally, a very personal odyssey of discovery and engagement. It’s also a project with wider implications than most film criticism. Godfrey says: “When I first encountered Iranian films, I was struck by the ethos of compassion and humanism at the center of many. These movies give us a much different picture of Iranians than the toxic, hostile image presented by the news media. I still think Iranian cinema not only can make Americans think about the lack of humane values in many of our films, but also can help create the kind of understanding needed to head off conflicts between Iran and the U.S. – a danger that right now seems all too real.” We appreciate all contributions to the campaign of any size, and we hope you will let friends and family know about it. As you can see, we are offering an array of perks relating to Kiarostami, Iranian cinema and Godfrey’s work. More perks to be added as the campaign progresses!*",15.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>Between Two Worlds</i> is about a young Celtic girl captured and taken to Rome, where she is sold as a slave. The novel follows her quest for identity and journey to acceptance despite her unfortunate circumstances. </p>
<p>My name is Cheyenne van Langevelde, and I wrote this book because I enjoy reading fiction set during the first century and wanted to write my own story, drawing inspiration from my favorite authors. </p>
<p>I hope that, in reading this book, you will not only learn about life in Rome during the first century A.D., but you will discover, along with Enid, that your worth is not dependent upon circumstances or your past, but on what you hope and trust in. </p>
<p><i>Enid, a young Celt, is overjoyed when the youth she admires tells her of his love for her. But her hopes and dreams are shattered when slave traders ambush them and sell Enid off as a slave in Rome. So she buries her past, struggling to survive in a world vastly different from her own. </i></p>
<p><i>Illegitimate and rejected by society because of his British ancestry, Lucius is desperate to prove his worth as a Roman. He enlists in the army with hopes of gaining honor, only to lose everything in the process. </i></p>
<p><i>Two different souls, one hopeful for change, one seething in bitterness, both caught between two worlds. When they collide, nothing will ever be the same. </i></p>
<p><i>Yet Rome is hostile towards these outcasts of society, and Enid must learn to lose one identity in order to gain another, placing her faith and trust in the God of the Christiani if she and Lucius are to have any hope for a future together at all.</i></p>
<p>You will love this book if you enjoy historical fiction, especially those set in ancient cultures. This book is similar to classics such as <i>The Eagle of the Ninth</i> by Rosemary Sutcliff, <i>The Bronze Bow</i> by Elizabeth George Speare, <i>The Spartan</i> by Caroline Dale Snedeker, and <i>A Voice in the Wind</i> by Francine Rivers. </p>

<p><strong>Story of My Book</strong></p>This Too Shall Pass is about making peace with pain and finding gratitude in adversity.<br/><br/>My name is Jet Mendes and I am the author of This Too Shall Pass. I’ve written this book out of respect for everyone who has made me who I am, and with the hope that the stories of my life may resonate with others. It’s a kind of thank you note to life, and a means to help provide light to the life of others. <br/><br/>My hope is that this book will evoke a greater sense of trust in life, a desire to dive deeper in the self discovery process, a greater appreciation of the present moment, and a deeper sense of love. <br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about creating joy for ourselves and surrendering, allowing life to work with rather than against you. It includes stories such as:<p>Not becoming the college athlete I believed I was meant to be. (Self-Discovery)</p>
<p>My first meditation. (Awakening)</p>
<p>Finding peace while grieving the loss of my mother. (Inner Peace)</p>
<br/>You will enjoy this book if you are at any kind of crossroad in your life, if you are overcoming any kind of adversity, if you wish to fill your life to the brim with love, and if you wish to find serenity in every discomfort. This book should be a kind of meditation, a therapeutic conversation.<br/> <p><strong>The Book</strong> - <i>This Too Shall Pass</i></p>The book is written in 2 Parts....<br/><br/><i>Part 1</i> contains the Introduction + Chapters 1-9. The first part of the book is a lot about coming to terms with surrendering, whether that be to the loss of my mother or the houses and the cars. It is the shocking recognition of the ego, as though placed under a surgical light, and the beginning of the egoic erosion process.<br/><br/><i>Part 2</i> contains Chapters 10-15. The second part of the book holds primary focus of life without the ego – the beauty of what life becomes when we choose to live without it.<br/> <p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></p>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

And there are certainly times when I can act that way, but, like all of us, I do my best. I think it’s important that we do not sacrifice the heart’s immortal youth and playfulness no matter how serious life gets. I remind myself of that often.

</div><p>Thank you so much of all of your love and support!<br/><br/>Thanks again,<br/>Jet Mendes</p></div>","Story of My BookThis Too Shall Pass is about making peace with pain and finding gratitude in adversity.My name is Jet Mendes and I am the author of This Too Shall Pass. I’ve written this book out of respect for everyone who has made me who I am, and with the hope that the stories of my life may resonate with others. It’s a kind of thank you note to life, and a means to help provide light to the life of others. My hope is that this book will evoke a greater sense of trust in life, a desire to dive deeper in the self discovery process, a greater appreciation of the present moment, and a deeper sense of love. In this book, you'll learn about creating joy for ourselves and surrendering, allowing life to work with rather than against you. It includes stories such as:Not becoming the college athlete I believed I was meant to be. (Self-Discovery)
My first meditation. (Awakening)
Finding peace while grieving the loss of my mother. (Inner Peace)
You will enjoy this book if you are at any kind of crossroad in your life, if you are overcoming any kind of adversity, if you wish to fill your life to the brim with love, and if you wish to find serenity in every discomfort. This book should be a kind of meditation, a therapeutic conversation. The Book - This Too Shall PassThe book is written in 2 Parts....Part 1 contains the Introduction + Chapters 1-9. The first part of the book is a lot about coming to terms with surrendering, whether that be to the loss of my mother or the houses and the cars. It is the shocking recognition of the ego, as though placed under a surgical light, and the beginning of the egoic erosion process.Part 2 contains Chapters 10-15. The second part of the book holds primary focus of life without the ego – the beauty of what life becomes when we choose to live without it. What I Need & What You'll GetThis book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following: The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in July, 2020

The Launch & Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this SummerWhen I pre-sell 100 copies of my book, I will publish. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish an audiobook.

And more... About the AuthorJet Mendes is a student at the University of Southern California where he has been recognized for his outstanding merit in theatre. He is also an accomplished writer having won awards in creative writing for his work titled “Mother Knows Best.” Granted, most days I still feel like a four year old child running around tirelessly. And there are certainly times when I can act that way, but, like all of us, I do my best. I think it’s important that we do not sacrifice the heart’s immortal youth and playfulness no matter how serious life gets. I remind myself of that often.

<h3><u>About the Book</u></h3>
<p>As thick smoke from a nearby wildfire lingers in a small Oregon town, daily life begins to more closely resemble an apocalyptic sci-fi film than summer vacation and the locals all go a bit nuts. However, the Gilbert family just goes a bit more nuts than usual. </p>
<p>The father, Greg, is so severely depressed over the toxic air quality and the loss of work that he barely gets out of bed, choosing instead to haunt online forums pushing conspiracies about why the fire hasn’t yet been extinguished. </p>
<p>The mother, Lina, is plagued with guilt over the state of the environment and tries to drag her family to volunteer at various charities to alleviate her personal distress, but consistently ditches to smoke pot. </p>
<p>Emma, the teen daughter freshly-returned from the ultra-liberal University of Oregon as an evangelistic vegan, becomes an eco-radical and spends her evenings in campaigns of petty sabotage directed at anyone over the age of 30 for their complicity in climate change.</p>
<p>And the teenage son, Shannon, finds literal escape by taking a job as trail guide to a man searching for Bigfoot in the mountains beyond the smoke’s reach, but finds that the constant trips in and out of the smoke begin to warp his sense of reality.</p>
<p>Each chapter is told from a different character’s POV, weaving multiple plot threads together as the Gilbert family unravels. They are each simultaneously at war with the weather, with each other, and with their fracturing senses of self and order to the universe. By summer's end, nothing will be the same. </p>
<h3><u><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Why This Book Matters</span></u></h3>
<p><i>Summer</i> <i>of Smoke</i> was inspired by the brutal fires my hometown in Oregon endured in 2018. Businesses closed. Events were cancelled. No one left the house without smoke masks. Anyone who could afford it went out of town and lived in hotels. Every day looked and felt like the end of the world, and yet the world just kept on going about its business, leaving everyone to make their own sense out of it.</p>
<p>After about three months, the fires became national news. Not because the national media noticed our plight, but because the smoke turned south and hit San Francisco for a day. Suddenly, it was a major emergency. </p>
<p>At first, I was angry that we had suffered for months without anyone noticing. Then I realized there was no reason they would. Rural Oregon is as close to nowhere as one can get in America. Its events and culture are not widely known or understood. I'd never read a book set in my hometown, or seen a film set there, or even one that took place in an Oregon that even remotely resembled the way I'd grown up. </p>
<p>I decided that day to write this book to shine a light on the unique regional culture, and life during fire season in the age of climate change.  </p>
<p><i>Summer of Smoke </i>captures the look and feel of an unusual culture in an unusual time, while addressing social anxiety over how unusual those conditions may be in our rapidly changing environment—but it wraps those themes up in a fast-paced comedy about a dysfunctional family and a coming of age story about looking for Bigfoot.</p>

This is the publication/pre-sale campaign for my new novel, Summer of Smoke, an ensemble comedy set in Oregon's fire season. 
Summer of Smoke will be my fifth book. As always, I am seeking to publish independently so my books are funded by those who appreciate them most: their own audience.

About the Book
As thick smoke from a nearby wildfire lingers in a small Oregon town, daily life begins to more closely resemble an apocalyptic sci-fi film than summer vacation and the locals all go a bit nuts. However, the Gilbert family just goes a bit more nuts than usual. 
The father, Greg, is so severely depressed over the toxic air quality and the loss of work that he barely gets out of bed, choosing instead to haunt online forums pushing conspiracies about why the fire hasn’t yet been extinguished. 
The mother, Lina, is plagued with guilt over the state of the environment and tries to drag her family to volunteer at various charities to alleviate her personal distress, but consistently ditches to smoke pot. 
Emma, the teen daughter freshly-returned from the ultra-liberal University of Oregon as an evangelistic vegan, becomes an eco-radical and spends her evenings in campaigns of petty sabotage directed at anyone over the age of 30 for their complicity in climate change.
And the teenage son, Shannon, finds literal escape by taking a job as trail guide to a man searching for Bigfoot in the mountains beyond the smoke’s reach, but finds that the constant trips in and out of the smoke begin to warp his sense of reality.
Each chapter is told from a different character’s POV, weaving multiple plot threads together as the Gilbert family unravels.

Every day looked and felt like the end of the world, and yet the world just kept on going about its business, leaving everyone to make their own sense out of it.
After about three months, the fires became national news. Not because the national media noticed our plight, but because the smoke turned south and hit San Francisco for a day. Suddenly, it was a major emergency. 
At first, I was angry that we had suffered for months without anyone noticing. Then I realized there was no reason they would. Rural Oregon is as close to nowhere as one can get in America.

<p><strong>Story of My Book</strong></p>
<p><i>Quit Repeating Yourself</i> outlines three key aspects of business: 1) Culture and Leadership, 2) Systems and Processes and 3) Recruiting and Hiring. In this book, I share how these aspects helped me create the sustainable growth and positive culture that built my business.<br/><br/>My name is Jaime Jay and I am the author of <i>Quit Repeating Yourself</i>. I wrote this book to show you, the aspiring or veteran business leader, how to have sustainable growth in your business by harnessing the power of your focus. I will explain how you can drastically change the speed and direction of your business by refocusing your actions; acting as if it was the last time you were going to do them and no longer doing the wrong things. This, in turn, allows you to focus on doing your best work.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for building a business. I interviewed over 1,000 business leaders and share with you what I learned from them as well as through my own experiences. This includes the importance of building a positive company culture through strong leadership skills, the need to put systems in place to provide a scalable business environment and the elements of effective recruiting and hiring strategies. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you become a better leader, build a sustainable company and find the right people for your organization.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn how to build a positive company culture through effective leadership skills and how to create systems based on your experiences. You'll also learn what I do in my own company to improve recruiting and hiring processes. You'll also hear key points, such as ...</p>
<ul>
<li>Why culture is way more than a mission statement or words on a wall. It is how a company behaves and what informs every decision, action and reaction. Culture is the invisible hand, the true north that guides every organization, and if you build a legendary culture you will build a legendary company.</li>
<li>How starting, building and growing a business is very exciting. To be able to create something that never existed before is an incredible feeling. However, most ventures fail when the excitement wears off. Typically, they fail for one of two reasons - the leaders didn't focus on the problems or, more than likely, they lacked a business system.</li>
<li>And, how the hiring market today has become extremely competitive. Companies can no longer simply rely on posting job openings online. Thousands of companies are posting on the same digital job boards so there is no guarantee the right candidates will see a specific listing.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you your business can’t run without you, if you can’t seem to break the 7-figure mark, if you don’t have written processes for every aspect of your business and/or if you can’t seem to find the right employees.<br/><br/>Quit Repeating Yourself is a nonfiction book that speaks to entrepreneurs, business leaders and managers who want to look at building a sustainable business that runs itself and inspires its employees in a very new and different way.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>The Book - Quit Repeating Yourself</strong></p>
<p>The book is written in three parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains a forward from my good friend, #1 Apple podcast host and best-selling author, Christopher Lochhead, and is dedicated to positive culture and leadership. I will unpack the most powerful intangible, culture. I’ve spent several years interviewing hundreds of business men and women to learn why they were such great leaders and I’ll share with you why I believe building a positive culture begins at the top.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains chapters defining why systems, processes and workflows are so important and how to build your very own scalable foundation. Have you ever been asked a question by one of your employees that you knew the answer to and relayed it to them right away? Have you ever been upset by an employee asking you a question because they should already have known the answer? Have you ever had to answer the same question over and over again? How much time does this waste?<br/><br/>I get it. Sometimes your employees do not take the time to do their research, but can you prevent this? Whose fault is it, really. Could you be the bottleneck? Have you clearly defined the expectations for your team? Be real. You could have done better, right? I know I strive to be a better leader every single day.<br/><br/>When you feel frustrated by someone and hear that little evil fella pop up on your shoulder motivating you to think to yourself, “Come on. How do you not know that”? Chances are it is because you haven’t taken the time to document your thoughts and your company processes. Remember, there is only one YOU. That is why I believe so strongly that sharing information with your team will create a solid foundation for your business.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> reveals some very creative hiring and recruiting strategies I use in my company. After doing over 1,000 interviews since the early 2000s, I have learned a thing or two about what to look for when you recruiting and hiring new talent. Believe it or not, several years ago I was fired from a big corporate staffing agency because they said I wasn’t a good fit. They were right. I felt like a round peg trying to fit into a square hole. Have you ever felt like that? Our recruiting and hiring process is different and I really enjoy seeing our clients completely shift the way they live their lives after going through it. Now, I want to share these same strategies with you so you can feel the same way.</p>
<p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></p>
<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>

<li>The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</li>
<li>The launch &amp; promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish later on this summer.</li>
</ul>
<p>When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition.

You will love this book if you your business can’t run without you, if you can’t seem to break the 7-figure mark, if you don’t have written processes for every aspect of your business and/or if you can’t seem to find the right employees.Quit Repeating Yourself is a nonfiction book that speaks to entrepreneurs, business leaders and managers who want to look at building a sustainable business that runs itself and inspires its employees in a very new and different way. 
The Book - Quit Repeating Yourself
The book is written in three parts.Part 1 contains a forward from my good friend, #1 Apple podcast host and best-selling author, Christopher Lochhead, and is dedicated to positive culture and leadership. I will unpack the most powerful intangible, culture. I’ve spent several years interviewing hundreds of business men and women to learn why they were such great leaders and I’ll share with you why I believe building a positive culture begins at the top.Part 2 contains chapters defining why systems, processes and workflows are so important and how to build your very own scalable foundation. Have you ever been asked a question by one of your employees that you knew the answer to and relayed it to them right away? Have you ever been upset by an employee asking you a question because they should already have known the answer? Have you ever had to answer the same question over and over again? How much time does this waste?I get it. Sometimes your employees do not take the time to do their research, but can you prevent this? Whose fault is it, really. Could you be the bottleneck? Have you clearly defined the expectations for your team? Be real. You could have done better, right? I know I strive to be a better leader every single day.When you feel frustrated by someone and hear that little evil fella pop up on your shoulder motivating you to think to yourself, “Come on. How do you not know that”? Chances are it is because you haven’t taken the time to document your thoughts and your company processes. Remember, there is only one YOU. That is why I believe so strongly that sharing information with your team will create a solid foundation for your business.Part 3 reveals some very creative hiring and recruiting strategies I use in my company. After doing over 1,000 interviews since the early 2000s, I have learned a thing or two about what to look for when you recruiting and hiring new talent. Believe it or not, several years ago I was fired from a big corporate staffing agency because they said I wasn’t a good fit. They were right. I felt like a round peg trying to fit into a square hole. Have you ever felt like that? Our recruiting and hiring process is different and I really enjoy seeing our clients completely shift the way they live their lives after going through it. Now, I want to share these same strategies with you so you can feel the same way.

<h2><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h2>
<p><i>Before 18: A Journey of Living, Loving, Hurting, and Healing</i> is a poetry collection that focuses on the process of <strong>hurting and healing from mental trauma</strong>. The poems have an underlying theme of nature and its impact on life. <br/><br/>My name is Niharika Ghosh and I am the author of <strong><i>Before 18: A Journey of Living, Loving, Hurting, and Healing</i></strong>. I wrote this book because I went through a lot of personal struggles in my last year before adulthood, hence the name “<i>Before 18</i>."" Writing poetry was my way of coping with my strong emotions, and I wanted to share these poems and my journey with the world.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will have an emotional reaction and feel personally connected to the poems. I want you to see this book as an <strong>opportunity to reflect upon yourself and your experiences</strong>, and if you have shared in these feelings before, to embrace that. Everyone has gone through mental challenges and conflict of some kind, which often leave a lasting mental impact. It is important for all of us to learn how to confront uncomfortable feelings and learn self love and compassion so that we may heal. <strong>Healing is a painful, messy process, but it is possible</strong>, so I want to leave you with a sense of hope as you close the last page.<br/><br/>In this book, you’ll join me in exploring <strong>mental health, trauma, and recovery</strong> and discovering the power of healing through poems like: </p>
<p><strong>“Waterfall”</strong> — a poem about overwhelming sadness and years of pain cascading in an emotional waterfall.</p>
<p><strong>“Dancing Flames” </strong>— a poem describing the unpredictable and volatile nature of fire, a metaphor for the passion within ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>“Healing”</strong> — an inspiring poem to provide hope that healing from pain is possible and there is light in the future.</p>
<p>You will love this book if you enjoy reading emotional poetry, have dealt with mental health issues, or want to focus on <strong>learning how to heal</strong> from the past. Most importantly, you will love this book if you have ever been a teenager yourself, because everyone shares the rollercoaster journey of ups and downs during these transformative years. <br/><br/><i>Before 18</i> speaks to teenagers and young adults who want to grapple with mental struggles and healing in a new way. However, <strong>any person</strong>, regardless of their current stage in life, will be able to relate to one or more of the themes and emotions shared in my poems.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>Before 18</i> inspires <strong>reflection</strong> and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can I confront and heal from my own trauma?</li>
<li>How can I have a stronger emotional understanding of my loved ones?</li>
<li>How does do these themes relate to the larger mental health crisis in society?</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing <strong>trauma, pain, and healing</strong> will change us all for the better. </p>
<p> </p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;"">Short Summary</span></p> <p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">My name is Tim Sutton.  I am an author and a screenprint and stained glass artist. In collaboration with the Mormon Artists Group, I created a memoir/art piece that we launched this past April (2015) called <i>Me and Thad</i>.  </span></p>
<p>The<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> project began as a memoir about my brother Thad, who was born with a rare and life-threatening birth defect. Very early on, I realized that because of the nature of his condition, Thad's life was simple, but his story is found in the lives of everyone who knew him. I discovered that the best way for me to tell Thad's story was to explore my own life, my own struggles with feelings of being inexplicably different from what I was supposed to be, and my own journey toward understanding and acceptance of myself, of my family and of the world at large, while acknowledging how deeply Thad's presence in my life helped me along the way.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I am a gay man with a Mormon background, but this story is more than a typical ""coming out"" tale. It is the story of my family whose deeply held spiritual and religious convictions helped us make sense of a devastating reality when Thad was born. Hope, love, and faith pulled us together and set the stage for a deep and meaningful family life. Still, though that foundation did not circumvent the sometimes painful challenges that arose when I began to mature and explore the doubts and feelings that had perplexed me for most of my youth, it did create an environment that encouraged trust, communication, forgiveness, and growth.</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">  </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The journey, my journey, was not only towards accepting my sexuality, but even more toward understanding and accepting those who were having a hard time understanding me--for however long they needed. Through this whole process, I learned that the truth of every story is as big as everyone involved. Though I could not write from everyone's perspective, I did my best to honor the fact that they had one. This is a personal, </span>sometimes serious<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">, often funny, story about family, tireless parents, faith, trust, service, and love. </span><br/></p>
<p>The goal of the Mormon Artists Group when they approached me about this idea was to create 24 gorgeous, signed, hand-bound limited edition volumes that they could make available to their collectors. These collector's editions included 6 original screenprint illustrations and endpapers that I created bound into the book. I also created one stained glass version of each illustration which were paired with six of the books. </p>
<p>Once the collector's editions were complete, and mostly sold, we made a paperback version and a kindle version available on amazon.com. From the beginning, that was where our collaboration would end. Any marketing or efforts to get the word out regarding the paperback and electronic versions were my responsibility. I started by creating an iBooks version as well for iPad readers, and I've been doing my best to use social media and whatever other means at my disposal to gradually move outward through friends/family, their friends/family and so on. </p>
<p>I've had quite a few people ask me if I am going to make an audio version of the book. There are many people who don't read books, but who will listen to them--commuters, tread-millers, you name it. My grandfather lost his sight in the latter part of his life, and books on tape were a real blessing for him. In writing and publishing a book, it seems to me that the process, now, in our technologically-driven world is not complete until all of the bases are covered: hard copy, electronic versions, audio version (and that is in the first language.)  I am confident that by creating an audiobook version, I will expand my audience even more.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></p>
<p>This is where you come in. I need your help to make this happen.     </p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>There are two parts to this audiobook:  </div>
<div>
<span><br/></span>The first part, obviously, is recording the book itself, which I will be doing at The Sound Distillery here in Manhattan. They are excited about the project and they have been very helpful with suggestions and direction. I could not have asked for a more positive collaboration. Our budget for this part of the process is $4,000</div>
<div>
<span><br/></span>The second part of this process involves arranging and recording two songs that I wrote while I was a missionary in southern Spain. Both songs are incorporated into the text of the book, and I feel it would be best to include the actual songs, rather than simply reading the lyrics. I am very lucky to be working with Matthew Dean Marsh to make these recordings possible. Our budget for this part of the process is $2,000</div>
<div>
<span><br/></span>So, our total budget for this project is $6,000.  I will be covering any incidental expenses like coaching, consulting, or anything else that I determine along the way will make the end product the best and highest quality I am capable of producing.</div>
<div>
<span><br/></span>We have 30 days from the launch to reach our goal of $6,000. If we don't quite make it, I will be incredibly grateful for whatever amount we do achieve. Then, I will regroup and figure out how to make up the difference. This project will go forward. If we exceed our goal, any additional funds will be used toward translating the text into Spanish and Portuguese, since I know that I already have an audience waiting who speaks those languages.</div>
<div>
<span><br/></span>We have some fun perks in a wide range of dollar amounts.  These are all items that I have created (in the case of the film 'extraordinary measures,' my brother Travis made the film, I helped him as a producer/consultant/cheerleader) and I hope they will make it more exciting and worthwhile to donate!</div>

<div>In 2006, Travis Sutton made this compelling documentary about Thad. He created the narrative based on interviews he did with members of the family. During the course of production, our father had a heart attack which resulted in a brain injury, so Travis documented our father's progress from ""if he survives"" to ""he's doing well, but we're not sure he will ever recover his memory.""

</div></div>","Short Summary My name is Tim Sutton.  I am an author and a screenprint and stained glass artist. In collaboration with the Mormon Artists Group, I created a memoir/art piece that we launched this past April (2015) called Me and Thad.  
The project began as a memoir about my brother Thad, who was born with a rare and life-threatening birth defect. Very early on, I realized that because of the nature of his condition, Thad's life was simple, but his story is found in the lives of everyone who knew him. I discovered that the best way for me to tell Thad's story was to explore my own life, my own struggles with feelings of being inexplicably different from what I was supposed to be, and my own journey toward understanding and acceptance of myself, of my family and of the world at large, while acknowledging how deeply Thad's presence in my life helped me along the way.
I am a gay man with a Mormon background, but this story is more than a typical ""coming out"" tale. It is the story of my family whose deeply held spiritual and religious convictions helped us make sense of a devastating reality when Thad was born. Hope, love, and faith pulled us together and set the stage for a deep and meaningful family life. Still, though that foundation did not circumvent the sometimes painful challenges that arose when I began to mature and explore the doubts and feelings that had perplexed me for most of my youth, it did create an environment that encouraged trust, communication, forgiveness, and growth.  
The journey, my journey, was not only towards accepting my sexuality, but even more toward understanding and accepting those who were having a hard time understanding me--for however long they needed. Through this whole process, I learned that the truth of every story is as big as everyone involved. Though I could not write from everyone's perspective, I did my best to honor the fact that they had one. This is a personal, sometimes serious, often funny, story about family, tireless parents, faith, trust, service, and love. 
The goal of the Mormon Artists Group when they approached me about this idea was to create 24 gorgeous, signed, hand-bound limited edition volumes that they could make available to their collectors. These collector's editions included 6 original screenprint illustrations and endpapers that I created bound into the book. I also created one stained glass version of each illustration which were paired with six of the books. 
Once the collector's editions were complete, and mostly sold, we made a paperback version and a kindle version available on amazon.com. From the beginning, that was where our collaboration would end. Any marketing or efforts to get the word out regarding the paperback and electronic versions were my responsibility. I started by creating an iBooks version as well for iPad readers, and I've been doing my best to use social media and whatever other means at my disposal to gradually move outward through friends/family, their friends/family and so on. 
I've had quite a few people ask me if I am going to make an audio version of the book. There are many people who don't read books, but who will listen to them--commuters, tread-millers, you name it. My grandfather lost his sight in the latter part of his life, and books on tape were a real blessing for him. In writing and publishing a book, it seems to me that the process, now, in our technologically-driven world is not complete until all of the bases are covered: hard copy, electronic versions, audio version (and that is in the first language.)  I am confident that by creating an audiobook version, I will expand my audience even more. 
This is where you come in. I need your help to make this happen.     
   What We Need & What You Get
There are two parts to this audiobook:  

The first part, obviously, is recording the book itself, which I will be doing at The Sound Distillery here in Manhattan. They are excited about the project and they have been very helpful with suggestions and direction. I could not have asked for a more positive collaboration. Our budget for this part of the process is $4,000

The second part of this process involves arranging and recording two songs that I wrote while I was a missionary in southern Spain. Both songs are incorporated into the text of the book, and I feel it would be best to include the actual songs, rather than simply reading the lyrics. I am very lucky to be working with Matthew Dean Marsh to make these recordings possible. Our budget for this part of the process is $2,000

So, our total budget for this project is $6,000.  I will be covering any incidental expenses like coaching, consulting, or anything else that I determine along the way will make the end product the best and highest quality I am capable of producing.

We have 30 days from the launch to reach our goal of $6,000. If we don't quite make it, I will be incredibly grateful for whatever amount we do achieve. Then, I will regroup and figure out how to make up the difference. This project will go forward. If we exceed our goal, any additional funds will be used toward translating the text into Spanish and Portuguese, since I know that I already have an audience waiting who speaks those languages.

We have some fun perks in a wide range of dollar amounts.  These are all items that I have created (in the case of the film 'extraordinary measures,' my brother Travis made the film, I helped him as a producer/consultant/cheerleader) and I hope they will make it more exciting and worthwhile to donate!

<h3>The Backstory...<br/> </h3>
<p>My name is <strong>Ahmed Sirour</strong>.</p>
<p>Years ago, I dropped out of undergrad from my university where I was studying marketing, because I felt I wasn't really learning what I needed and tried my luck in the job force. I ended up at a bank and became a bank teller, but because of a few marketing/promotional internships I had while in school, I actually managed to impress the marketing director of the bank (on a chance encounter at the bank HQs) and got promoted right into the marketing department of that bank and made good money–without even needing the degree!</p>
<p>But I discovered I wasn't fulfilled.</p>
<p>During that time, I was also teaching myself how to play the piano/keyboard by ear (since I've loved music all my life) because I found I actually had a talent for it. After while, I then decided to leave Corporate America and take my savings and a big leap of faith to see if my hobby and passion could turn into me becoming an actual professional musician.</p>
<p><i>And I actually achieved that!</i></p>
<p>During those years as an up-and-coming musician, I achieved quite a lot more for someone who was a self-starter with no contacts in the beginning, including even scoring my own weekly jam session at a hot cafe in the city, with my own band, and a packed house each night we played, but after a while became disillusioned with the cut-throat/cookie-cutter music scene there and wondered if I should travel to other cities around the country and see where other opportunities might be. I had no idea that the Universe would choose that time to cross my path with a beautiful student doing a summer program in town before heading back to her state, and then a mere few days later after that would leave the country for a study abroad program in North Africa. I had no idea that our growing romance would be the catalyst for what would become my own solo world travels. Like the famous book, <i>The Alchemist</i>, I saw myself on an amazing journey to discover what and where my ""treasures"" were...and interestingly it actually began (just like the book) with my standing in the actual Sahara desert, overlooking endless sand dunes, wondering where next the adventure would take me.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484333392/ng02lipkudzrdxq2ooe0.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>A year later, after my ex and I broke up, I left the country for a 3-week excursion to the UK...and then the adventure really took off! Somehow, I managed to get accepted into a Masters degree program at a prestigious university in London with NO PREVIOUS Bachelors degree, and from that point forward, I would end up spending significant time in or actually living in various cities/countries around the world, and eventually visited every continent on Earth (except Antarctica...for now).</p>
<p>But let me not get ahead of myself, because there's a LOT being left out (thus the need for this BOOK), and even more amazing stories that cover the last 10 years of my life (2006-2016) criss-crossing the planet. And the thing is, even though I'm a musician, the vast majority of my travels had nothing to do with a tour or concert, and many times I had very little to practically NOTHING in my pockets, while in the middle of some country where English was not the native language (sometimes not even anyone nearby who spoke it). And to be from the proverbial hood–if anyone knows anything about Brownsville, Brooklyn, you get what  I mean–but then find myself in places I had only read about or seen in movies, or public television travel series, or in pictures I saw in National Geographic magazines–so many moments when I had to pinch myself to believe I was where I was!</p>
<p>Throughout it all, it was also filled with many challenges, dangerous close calls, crazy scenarios but also miracles, blessings, hilarious moments, deeply introspective revelations, close friendships made, numerous life lessons and experiences had, and...well...that's why I'm writing a book, so lemme chill before I do that here!<br/><br/>So many people who have been following my travels (whether via my Facebook music page to just my friends who keep up with me on social media) have said I need to write a book with all the stories I've accumulated and have shared with them, so I truly hope these same people (and you who are reading this and hearing about me for the first time) will also support this project that I am finally embarking on! And with that, here's the campaign breakdown...<br/> </p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get (the Tran$parency part)<br/> </h3>
<p>Well, I need money to get this book completed (properly and professionally) and then you and the rest of the world get to reap the benefits of it by getting a copy of the finished product and more! I've gone over the numbers from various sources online of professionals who recommended the best budget and decided to base my needs off of the following website: <a href=""http://mediashift.org/2013/05/the-real-costs-of-self-publishing-book/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://mediashift.org/2013/05/the-real-costs-of-self-publishing-book/</a>.

<ul>
<li><i><strong>Developmental editing</strong> <strong>(content structure/fluidity)- $2,520</strong></i></li>
<li>
<i><strong>Copyediting</strong></i><i><strong> (proofreading) - $840</strong></i>
</li>
<li><i><strong>Cover design - </strong><strong>Low end: $150 (to get a professional to properly render my mockup)</strong></i></li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges (aka Leaps of Faiths and Opportunities)</h3>
<p>The only risk I've faced in approaching this book is the amount of time I've waited until I finally decided to bring it into existence, and the only real challenge is getting out of my own way and make it happen. My legacy-building has been through music, thus far, and I'm blessed to have received messages from others about how my work has moved, inspired, or helped them, which means the world to me! And now I have this opportunity to use my talents in the written word, combined with my unique life experiences and perspective, to offer this time capsule of words and photos (also videos and music in the e-book version) of an unusual journey that is rich with stories, travel insight, and hopefully an overall inspirational theme that can positively affect and change the lives of any who read it, around the world, and for generations to come; <i>this is the intention and desire for this book</i>!

</div></div>","The Backstory... 
My name is Ahmed Sirour.
Years ago, I dropped out of undergrad from my university where I was studying marketing, because I felt I wasn't really learning what I needed and tried my luck in the job force. I ended up at a bank and became a bank teller, but because of a few marketing/promotional internships I had while in school, I actually managed to impress the marketing director of the bank (on a chance encounter at the bank HQs) and got promoted right into the marketing department of that bank and made good money–without even needing the degree!
But I discovered I wasn't fulfilled.
During that time, I was also teaching myself how to play the piano/keyboard by ear (since I've loved music all my life) because I found I actually had a talent for it. After while, I then decided to leave Corporate America and take my savings and a big leap of faith to see if my hobby and passion could turn into me becoming an actual professional musician.
And I actually achieved that!
During those years as an up-and-coming musician, I achieved quite a lot more for someone who was a self-starter with no contacts in the beginning, including even scoring my own weekly jam session at a hot cafe in the city, with my own band, and a packed house each night we played, but after a while became disillusioned with the cut-throat/cookie-cutter music scene there and wondered if I should travel to other cities around the country and see where other opportunities might be. I had no idea that the Universe would choose that time to cross my path with a beautiful student doing a summer program in town before heading back to her state, and then a mere few days later after that would leave the country for a study abroad program in North Africa. I had no idea that our growing romance would be the catalyst for what would become my own solo world travels. Like the famous book, The Alchemist, I saw myself on an amazing journey to discover what and where my ""treasures"" were...and interestingly it actually began (just like the book) with my standing in the actual Sahara desert, overlooking endless sand dunes, wondering where next the adventure would take me.

A year later, after my ex and I broke up, I left the country for a 3-week excursion to the UK...and then the adventure really took off! Somehow, I managed to get accepted into a Masters degree program at a prestigious university in London with NO PREVIOUS Bachelors degree, and from that point forward, I would end up spending significant time in or actually living in various cities/countries around the world, and eventually visited every continent on Earth (except Antarctica...for now).
But let me not get ahead of myself, because there's a LOT being left out (thus the need for this BOOK), and even more amazing stories that cover the last 10 years of my life (2006-2016) criss-crossing the planet. And the thing is, even though I'm a musician, the vast majority of my travels had nothing to do with a tour or concert, and many times I had very little to practically NOTHING in my pockets, while in the middle of some country where English was not the native language (sometimes not even anyone nearby who spoke it). And to be from the proverbial hood–if anyone knows anything about Brownsville, Brooklyn, you get what  I mean–but then find myself in places I had only read about or seen in movies, or public television travel series, or in pictures I saw in National Geographic magazines–so many moments when I had to pinch myself to believe I was where I was!
Throughout it all, it was also filled with many challenges, dangerous close calls, crazy scenarios but also miracles, blessings, hilarious moments, deeply introspective revelations, close friendships made, numerous life lessons and experiences had, and...well...that's why I'm writing a book, so lemme chill before I do that here!So many people who have been following my travels (whether via my Facebook music page to just my friends who keep up with me on social media) have said I need to write a book with all the stories I've accumulated and have shared with them, so I truly hope these same people (and you who are reading this and hearing about me for the first time) will also support this project that I am finally embarking on! And with that, here's the campaign breakdown... 


 
What I Need & What You Get (the Tran$parency part) 
Well, I need money to get this book completed (properly and professionally) and then you and the rest of the world get to reap the benefits of it by getting a copy of the finished product and more! I've gone over the numbers from various sources online of professionals who recommended the best budget and decided to base my needs off of the following website: http://mediashift.org/2013/05/the-real-costs-of-self-publishing-book/. I have chosen the lower end of the scale for the majority of their budget recommendations, so here is what you will be contributing to as follows:

Developmental editing (content structure/fluidity)- $2,520

Copyediting (proofreading) - $840

Cover design - Low end: $150 (to get a professional to properly render my mockup)
Formatting for print and digital conversion - Free ;-)
Getting an ISBN (International Standard Book Number) - $125 for one ISBN
U.S. Copyright fee - $35
Distribution: FREE! (i.e. Amazon, Barnes and Noble, Apple iBooks, etc.)
Cost of review from Publishers Weekly PW Select - $150
Marketing & PR - $1,000
Travel (for book launch) - $865

Crowdfunding fees (5%) + Credit Card fees (3%) = 454.80TOTAL: $6,140




 
Risks & Challenges (aka Leaps of Faiths and Opportunities)
The only risk I've faced in approaching this book is the amount of time I've waited until I finally decided to bring it into existence, and the only real challenge is getting out of my own way and make it happen. My legacy-building has been through music, thus far, and I'm blessed to have received messages from others about how my work has moved, inspired, or helped them, which means the world to me! And now I have this opportunity to use my talents in the written word, combined with my unique life experiences and perspective, to offer this time capsule of words and photos (also videos and music in the e-book version) of an unusual journey that is rich with stories, travel insight, and hopefully an overall inspirational theme that can positively affect and change the lives of any who read it, around the world, and for generations to come; this is the intention and desire for this book! You see, my resolve is that whether I reach or exceed my financial goal for this campaign or come up shorter than what I was shooting for, THIS BOOK WILL MUST GET PUBLISHED...one way or another! I believe this is something I was born to do, just as I realize now that I was supposed to become a musician! I will find a way, or make one, even if some of the things I listed I have to figure out and do on my own if push comes to shove, BUT I will also deliver a book...and a quality one at that!

What's my story?  I'm just a good ol’ spunky 24 year old Mormon girl from Mesa Arizona, trying to keep up with everyone around me. Yet there is one major setback that sure separates me from most… Bi-polar.</p>
<p>I am currently a patron of the 'somewhere after high school/before marriage' chapter of life, yet I tell a very different story than most my age.  I have struggled with mental illness for almost 5 years, and with that, has accompanied a pervasive darkness so thick, that most days, any type of avail feels impossible.  Time and time again I have watched hope slip from my fingers as I have jumped around from treatment to treatment, medication to medication, “answer” to “answer”.  </p>
<p>-I have seen over 19 different medical professionals</p>
<p>-I have tried over 26 different medications</p>
<p>-I have been administered 12 treatments of electric shock therapy</p>
<p>-I have lost a full-ride academic Scholarship</p>
<p>-I have received a mission call for my church, yet was considered ineligible to serve just days before my departure date</p>
<p>-I broke off an engagement</p>
<p>-I am unable to work</p>
<p>…<em>just to name a few of course </em>:)</p>
<p><strong><em>However…</em></strong> I decided early on that not only was I going to triumph over this disheveled life-hand, but more importantly, I was going to help others in the process.  I was pretty closet about all this Bi-polar jazz because I didn’t want to be known as “that” girl. I certainly feared society’s misconceptions pertaining to mental illness. Yet I now dream that by opening up about everything perhaps one day, not only will I mend from this, but along the way I might help someone through their own adversity. It has been through my writing that I have provided (<em>or at least strived to provide</em>) that secondary aide to others.  Through my writing I share with a very raw candor, my struggles, obstacles, heartache, but most importantly, my <strong><em>Hope</em></strong><em>.</em>  A hope that I believe is powerful enough to offer light to others no matter WHAT their opposition may be.</p>

(<em>444 being significant because of our family scripture Alma 44:4... and in honor of my great aunt and hero, Aunt Joyce)</em></p>
<p><a href=""http://josiethompson.com/the-444-project/about-project-444/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The 444 Project</a> idea evolved last fall, after I wrote my first initial Bi-polar post (<a href=""http://josiethompson.com/2012/10/20/all-should-read-love-josie/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>); a post that told the uncensored story of my personal bout with Depression/Bi-polar.  I had been writing a blog for awhile, but that particular post was the first real integral post I had ever published regarding my personal Bi-polar bout… I had finally decided that I am who I am, and I wanted to put it all out there for anyone and everyone to read.  I was terrified of what feedback would return my way, and at the time, had NO idea just what was to come… much to my surprise, hundred’s of emails came swarming in from friends family, and strangers alike, telling me about THEIR personal bouts and struggles.  I learned very VERY quickly, that I am not alone… and in the process, my desire to want to help others, only strengthened.  Then not soon after, one of my best friends challenged me to take that desire one step further- she suggested that I go out and really <em>do</em> something about it.</p>
<p>So while responding to my inner drive to help others, yet still catering to what limitations currently beset me, with the help of friends and family, we created <a href=""http://josiethompson.com/the-444-project/about-project-444/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The 444 Project</a>.  A project designed to give hope to all, and help me prove that 1) Everyone has a story to tell, 2) There is goodness everywhere, and 3) There is always a reason to get out of bed each day.  A project that once completed, I would turn into a book.  </p>
<p>I left the last week in March 2013 on <a href=""http://josiethompson.com/the-444-project/about-project-444/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The 444 Project</a> and have now been out over 3 months, as I have sought to collect 444 answers to my ultimate question: what gets YOU out of bed each day? During the project I have been living out of my car, drifting from one town to the next, all while interviewing perfect strangers.  I ask them about their lives asking them one final question:  What gets you out of bed each day?  And then as regularly as circumstances allow, I report back to my blog… <a href=""josiethompson.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">josiethompson.com</a>  </p>

<p>The past 3 months have been difficult, scary, adventurous, dangerous, exhilarating and much, much more... but ALWAYS, has it been worth it.  And I want to write a book to tell why. </p>
<p>I invite all of you to join alongside me for the newest phase of this journey, as I near the end of the travels and begin the writing of <a href=""http://josiethompson.com/the-444-project/about-project-444/'"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The 444 Project</a> Book. It is my personal conviction that this project has a divine purpose and possesses absolute potential to change lives- I have already observed it happen.   And even though many precious personal sacrifices have been required to advance this far, never have I ONCE questioned nor doubted the endeavor... that is how much promise lies within <a href=""http://josiethompson.com/the-444-project/about-project-444/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The 444 Project</a>.  I have believed in this project charge since its birth... and now it is time to officially write the book that tells the tale and allows me to explain why.  But I need YOUR help to do it.  Help me be that girl I aspire to be.

<p> </p></span></div>","My name is Josie Thompson. What's my story?  I'm just a good ol’ spunky 24 year old Mormon girl from Mesa Arizona, trying to keep up with everyone around me. Yet there is one major setback that sure separates me from most… Bi-polar.
I am currently a patron of the 'somewhere after high school/before marriage' chapter of life, yet I tell a very different story than most my age.  I have struggled with mental illness for almost 5 years, and with that, has accompanied a pervasive darkness so thick, that most days, any type of avail feels impossible.  Time and time again I have watched hope slip from my fingers as I have jumped around from treatment to treatment, medication to medication, “answer” to “answer”.  
-I have seen over 19 different medical professionals
-I have tried over 26 different medications
-I have been administered 12 treatments of electric shock therapy
-I have lost a full-ride academic Scholarship
-I have received a mission call for my church, yet was considered ineligible to serve just days before my departure date
-I broke off an engagement
-I am unable to work
…just to name a few of course :)
However… I decided early on that not only was I going to triumph over this disheveled life-hand, but more importantly, I was going to help others in the process.  I was pretty closet about all this Bi-polar jazz because I didn’t want to be known as “that” girl. I certainly feared society’s misconceptions pertaining to mental illness. Yet I now dream that by opening up about everything perhaps one day, not only will I mend from this, but along the way I might help someone through their own adversity. It has been through my writing that I have provided (or at least strived to provide) that secondary aide to others.  Through my writing I share with a very raw candor, my struggles, obstacles, heartache, but most importantly, my Hope.  A hope that I believe is powerful enough to offer light to others no matter WHAT their opposition may be.
And it was through the dual facet of writing and desire to help another that The 444 Project was born. (444 being significant because of our family scripture Alma 44:4... and in honor of my great aunt and hero, Aunt Joyce)
The 444 Project idea evolved last fall, after I wrote my first initial Bi-polar post (here); a post that told the uncensored story of my personal bout with Depression/Bi-polar.  I had been writing a blog for awhile, but that particular post was the first real integral post I had ever published regarding my personal Bi-polar bout… I had finally decided that I am who I am, and I wanted to put it all out there for anyone and everyone to read.  I was terrified of what feedback would return my way, and at the time, had NO idea just what was to come… much to my surprise, hundred’s of emails came swarming in from friends family, and strangers alike, telling me about THEIR personal bouts and struggles.  I learned very VERY quickly, that I am not alone… and in the process, my desire to want to help others, only strengthened.  Then not soon after, one of my best friends challenged me to take that desire one step further- she suggested that I go out and really do something about it.
So while responding to my inner drive to help others, yet still catering to what limitations currently beset me, with the help of friends and family, we created The 444 Project.  A project designed to give hope to all, and help me prove that 1) Everyone has a story to tell, 2) There is goodness everywhere, and 3) There is always a reason to get out of bed each day.  A project that once completed, I would turn into a book.

<p>We have a message to share with you and the world - a message we believe can transform our planet and humanity for the better (yeah, we know this sounds grandiose, but it's true).

<p>We need to get this book into the hands of ""movers and shakers"" - people who can help make this dream a reality in a powerful way. So, this is the idea: when you contribute, you'll get a copy, or copies, of<em> Conspiracy of Dreamers </em>(see the ""perks"" for details). Keep one to read yourself, and give (that is, have us send) a copy to the people you know (or know of) who you believe can help make the dream happen, either personally, or by passing the book to someone else (hopefully after they've read it :)  </p>

<p><i>May 10<sup>th</sup>, 2011 </i></p>
<p><i>I am in this. And as I move forward into the unknown, I wish for those of you to understand what it truly feels like to be one of the many, chosen for this journey. </i></p>
<p><i>To understand what it is like to have cancer. To have been in a place where you have been given the news that your life has been threatened. An incomprehensible moment.</i></p>
<p><i>I attempt to explain it to the world, as I try to explain it to myself.</i></p>
<p><i>Every day of your life has prepared you for this moment. As if all of your experiences were practice to determine how you were about to handle the news that you, yes YOU, have been chosen for this journey.</i></p>
<p>
</p><p><i>You will be afraid. You will not worry so much about the well-being of yourself, rather you will take on the pain of the suffering your loved ones feel, as they watch you climb over mountains. Oh the mountains you will climb.</i></p>
<p>
</p><p><i>You will have pain. You will have such incredible pain that you will have to mentally remove yourself from the situation, almost as if you are no longer in your physical body, like you are watching from the sidelines.</i></p>
<p>
</p><p><i>You will have humiliation. You will have every piece of your body poked, prodded, looked at, in, and on. </i></p>
<p>
</p><p><i>And you will lose your hair. But this is the uniform you will need to wear when you are in this army.</i></p>
<p>
</p><p><i>You will learn sacrifice. You will have to give up the most important moments in your life so that you can fight, so that you can survive, in an attempt to regain some of these very moments that were taken from you.</i></p>
<p>
</p><p><i>You will fight. You will fight every single day of your life, to be damn sure that in the end, you are standing on top of the bully, screaming at the top of your lungs, your incredible victory. And YOU did it. Yes YOU did it!</i></p>
<p>
</p><p><i>You will cry. You will cry for your family, your friends, your husband, your daughter. You will cry for your loss of control, the fear of the unknown, and the great hurt that you will experience. </i></p>
<p>
</p><p><i>You will suffer great disappointment. You will find out who your friends are. Your circle will change. You will be saddened at some of the losses, but you will honour their choices.</i></p>
<p>
</p><p><i>You will sleep less. You will struggle to close your eyes at night, for the fear of missing a moment, or not getting the gift of tomorrow.</i></p>
<p>
</p><p><i>You will question your faith. You will wonder, you will search. You will look for your purpose, your reason, your being. But you will find out. </i></p>
<p>
</p><p><i>You will laugh more. You will gain the ability to find humour in every situation. The opportunity to laugh at the things that hurt the most.</i></p>
<p>
</p><p><i>You will believe in second chances. A time to forgive, and forget. To move on, and to try again.  </i></p>
<p>
</p><p><i>You will love. And boy, you will LOVE. A love that you have never known before. The kind of love that guides your heart and clouds your brain. You will Love. You will Love. You will Love.</i></p>
<p>
</p><p><i>You will find beauty, in every instance, each moment you are offered. You will smile at the sunshine, the snow, the rain, the streams, the rivers, the mountains. You will appreciate the universal paintbrush, like you have never seen it before, and you may never see it again.</i></p>
<p>
</p><p><i>You will count your blessings every single day of your life. You will honour those who are less fortunate, who may not have the strength to move on. And you will never forget them.</i></p>
<p>
</p><p><i>You will be blindsided by the good in the world. Even when you may be surrounded by drama, gossip, and bad news. You will be overwhelmed by the good in the people. All of the people.</i></p>
<p>
</p><p><i>You will learn to live again. But you will live in a way that you never thought possible. A way where you strive to be better, to be good, to love. You will really live.</i></p>
<p>
</p><p><i>Lastly, you will accept this burden as the brilliant opportunity it is. The chance to find the strength in yourself that you never knew you had. </i></p>
<p><i>And you will hope. You will always hope. You must always hope. And you will fight. You will always fight. You must always fight.</i></p>
<p><i>And if that bully chooses to show itself again.  </i></p>
<p><i>You will win. You will win.</i></p>
<p><i>Love, Kyla</i></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3><b>Perks And Recognition</b></h3><div>Each contribution comes with different reward levels, but every contribution will receive a heart felt thank you, and public recognition.  Thank you!<p></p>
<p></p>
</div><ul></ul><p></p> <p> </p><h3>The Impact</h3><p></p><p>
</p><p><i> A warrior.</i></p>
<p>
</p><p><i>A warrior is defined as any person who shows or has shown great courage.</i></p><p></p><p></p><p>My final treatment was September 19<sup>th</sup>, 2011. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It is strange how quickly life changes. In just a breath, the world you thought you knew is taken away, and you are given a new look at life. With new priorities, and new reasons. </p>
<p>
</p><p>At the time that I was diagnosed, I was overcome with emotion.  Not knowing of the journey that I had yet to face.  And as I held my new born baby in my arms, I did not know if I truly had tomorrow.  And if I did, what that would like for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was in that moment when hope was defined for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And hope is the reason why I share my story.</p>
<p>Because for me, hope is not just a feeling.  Hope is a purpose.  </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope is what remains when everything else has been torn away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope is knowing that there are forces at work in the universe that extend way beyond what is in our control.  Hope is knowing when to trust in those forces, and hope is knowing when to defy them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope is knowing that even the hardest days shall turn to night.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope is trusting that a smile can last forever.  </p>
<p>And hope is believing that yes, time can stand still.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your support so that Warrior can offer hope to cancer survivors and their supporters.</p><ul></ul><p></p> <p> </p><h3>Other Ways That You Can Help</h3> <p></p><p>I have one wish. I wish that by sharing my journey, we all become motivated to pay it forward with whatever means we are able.  And at the same time, we become inspired to receive.  To receive the blessings that come at the most difficult times.   And to receive the gifts that are handed to us in each precious moment.</p><p>And that despite what we may be handed in our life, now or yet to come, that we are able to acknowledge the blessings in each circumstance, no matter how grand, no matter how dim.  </p><p>To truly live for the moment, to welcome our future, to accept our past, and to smile as we remember all of our days past.</p><p></p><p>I understand that not everyone is in a position to contribute financially, but you can still help.  </p><p>Please share this campaign through social media, and help Warrior make its way in the hands of the people affected by cancer.  Help me to spread the word and to share my story.  Thank you!</p><p></p><h2><br/></h2><p></p></div>","""I shall act in a way that gives love to the world,

I have decided to self-publish Warrior, and I have already dedicated my own funds towards the editing and technical writing of my book, but there is still more work to be done.In addition, because I am an actively involved with the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society of Canada, twenty percent of any funds raised over 7000.00$ during this campaign, will be donated to this cause, supporting Tally's Roses (my team) - Light the Night Campaign - as we support this event that continues to fund the research that saves lives.Watch - Kyla McMullin 2012 Honoured Hero Video here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFxb7Dt7e9oA Sneak Peak - An Entry from WarriorLet me share an entry with you.  I hope that it will allow for you some insight of all the souls, present and future, who have been touched by cancer.
May 10th, 2011 
I am in this. And as I move forward into the unknown, I wish for those of you to understand what it truly feels like to be one of the many, chosen for this journey. 
To understand what it is like to have cancer. To have been in a place where you have been given the news that your life has been threatened. An incomprehensible moment.
I attempt to explain it to the world, as I try to explain it to myself.
Every day of your life has prepared you for this moment. As if all of your experiences were practice to determine how you were about to handle the news that you, yes YOU, have been chosen for this journey.

You will be afraid. You will not worry so much about the well-being of yourself, rather you will take on the pain of the suffering your loved ones feel, as they watch you climb over mountains. Oh the mountains you will climb.

You will have pain. You will have such incredible pain that you will have to mentally remove yourself from the situation, almost as if you are no longer in your physical body, like you are watching from the sidelines.

You will have humiliation. You will have every piece of your body poked, prodded, looked at, in, and on. 

And you will lose your hair. But this is the uniform you will need to wear when you are in this army.

You will learn sacrifice. You will have to give up the most important moments in your life so that you can fight, so that you can survive, in an attempt to regain some of these very moments that were taken from you.

You will fight. You will fight every single day of your life, to be damn sure that in the end, you are standing on top of the bully, screaming at the top of your lungs, your incredible victory. And YOU did it. Yes YOU did it!

You will cry. You will cry for your family, your friends, your husband, your daughter. You will cry for your loss of control, the fear of the unknown, and the great hurt that you will experience. 

You will suffer great disappointment. You will find out who your friends are. Your circle will change. You will be saddened at some of the losses, but you will honour their choices.

You will sleep less. You will struggle to close your eyes at night, for the fear of missing a moment, or not getting the gift of tomorrow.

You will question your faith. You will wonder, you will search. You will look for your purpose, your reason, your being. But you will find out. 

You will laugh more. You will gain the ability to find humour in every situation. The opportunity to laugh at the things that hurt the most.

You will believe in second chances. A time to forgive, and forget. To move on, and to try again.  

You will love. And boy, you will LOVE. A love that you have never known before. The kind of love that guides your heart and clouds your brain. You will Love. You will Love. You will Love.

You will find beauty, in every instance, each moment you are offered. You will smile at the sunshine, the snow, the rain, the streams, the rivers, the mountains. You will appreciate the universal paintbrush, like you have never seen it before, and you may never see it again.

You will count your blessings every single day of your life. You will honour those who are less fortunate, who may not have the strength to move on. And you will never forget them.

You will be blindsided by the good in the world. Even when you may be surrounded by drama, gossip, and bad news. You will be overwhelmed by the good in the people. All of the people.

You will learn to live again. But you will live in a way that you never thought possible. A way where you strive to be better, to be good, to love. You will really live.

Lastly, you will accept this burden as the brilliant opportunity it is. The chance to find the strength in yourself that you never knew you had. 
And you will hope. You will always hope. You must always hope. And you will fight. You will always fight. You must always fight.
And if that bully chooses to show itself again.  
You will win. You will win.
Love, KylaPerks And RecognitionEach contribution comes with different reward levels, but every contribution will receive a heart felt thank you, and public recognition.  Thank you!

  The Impact
 A warrior.

A warrior is defined as any person who shows or has shown great courage.My final treatment was September 19th, 2011. 

It is strange how quickly life changes. In just a breath, the world you thought you knew is taken away, and you are given a new look at life. With new priorities, and new reasons. 

At the time that I was diagnosed, I was overcome with emotion.  Not knowing of the journey that I had yet to face.  And as I held my new born baby in my arms, I did not know if I truly had tomorrow.  And if I did, what that would like for me.

It was in that moment when hope was defined for me.

And hope is the reason why I share my story.
Because for me, hope is not just a feeling.  Hope is a purpose.  

Hope is what remains when everything else has been torn away.

Hope is knowing that there are forces at work in the universe that extend way beyond what is in our control.  Hope is knowing when to trust in those forces, and hope is knowing when to defy them.

Hope is knowing that even the hardest days shall turn to night.

Hope is trusting that a smile can last forever.  
And hope is believing that yes, time can stand still.

Thank you for your support so that Warrior can offer hope to cancer survivors and their supporters.  Other Ways That You Can Help I have one wish. I wish that by sharing my journey, we all become motivated to pay it forward with whatever means we are able.  And at the same time, we become inspired to receive.  To receive the blessings that come at the most difficult times.   And to receive the gifts that are handed to us in each precious moment.And that despite what we may be handed in our life, now or yet to come, that we are able to acknowledge the blessings in each circumstance, no matter how grand, no matter how dim.  To truly live for the moment, to welcome our future, to accept our past, and to smile as we remember all of our days past.I understand that not everyone is in a position to contribute financially, but you can still help.  Please share this campaign through social media, and help Warrior make its way in the hands of the people affected by cancer.  Help me to spread the word and to share my story.  Thank you!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Contact Stacy O'Neill, Christie Thompson or Jessica Hadden to receive an invitation via email or Facebook if you have not seen one yet. 
The actual calendar to reserve your visit time will be posted as soon as birth begins. Visits will start about one week later.
You can also contribute directly by purchasing breastfeeding items from the Babies R Us Registry:http://www.toysrus.com/registry/search/index.js...Thank you all for being a part of Little Bitty's beginnings. We are elated to bring Bitty to the world ~ <3",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is A.C. Burton and I am the author of Find Me in the Trenches. I wrote this book as an honest testament to what it takes to reclaim control of life moving forward, rather than staying stuck in the “trenches” of past adversities. We truly believe that this is a time for us to step out of our comfort zones and begin to walk towards true freedom.<br/><br/>My hope is, in reading this book, readers can discover what it takes to ultimately begin the process of healing - in family, relationships, and in self-identity. In this book, I hope to instill in readers the same sort of passion and excitement I have for the journey of healing and renewal of human spirit. Ultimately, I want readers to use this book as a testimony to share how overcoming adversity can be the ultimate strength to be resilient towards life’s challenges</p>

As feminism enters a new phase with a younger and more diverse generation at its core, the movement needs to evolve and question how traditional notions of liberation may actually contribute to continued oppression. <br/><br/>My name is Emily Hardy and I am the author of <i>Out of the Closet and Into the Streets: Why We Need to Practice Rainbow Feminism. </i><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">I wrote this book because as a young adult,  struggling to both define myself as a feminist and navigate my Queer identity, I often found myself asking larger identity questions about the kind of world I want to help build. Motivated by an authentic desire to communicate my beliefs about the direction of feminism, this book is my contribution to the future. </span></p><p>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will question the binaries that seem so fundamental to the constructions of Western society. In this book, I hope to instil in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the future of the Feminist movement and Queer liberation. Ultimately, I want you to see my work as a tool to help you understand the current relationship between the feminist movement and the LGBTQPIA2+ community but also as a challenge to traditional white-woman feminism that failed Queer, disabled, socio-economically disenfranchised and racial/ethnic minority communities. <br/><br/>In this book, you'll think about the true origins of knowledge and challenge the institutions of power that govern our relationships, not just with society and others but with ourselves. You'll hear stories from classic feminist thinkers, like Audre Lorde, and more contemporary scholars, like Sara Ahmed, on the evolving discourse of the liberation movement.</p><p><br/>If you are Queer or if you are a feminist, if you know it all or if you know nothing, this book is for you. I know that you will love this book if you want to critically analyze gender, Queerness and feminism in our current socio-political context.<br/><br/><i>Out of the Closet and Into the Streets:  Why We Need to Practice Rainbow Feminism </i>is a nonfiction book that speaks to the academic community and general public alike by distilling scholarly discourse in a digestible and approachable medium. For those who want to challenge their own subconscious bias, internalized misogyny, and compulsory heterosexuality (all terms I will discuss throughout the book--no worries if you are unfamiliar) my book is for you. </p><p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></p><p>My book will be published with New Degree Press and I already have a publishing contract. I just need your help. The pre-order tiers and campaign funds the book and makes my publishing dream a reality.

As feminism enters a new phase with a younger and more diverse generation at its core, the movement needs to evolve and question how traditional notions of liberation may actually contribute to continued oppression. My name is Emily Hardy and I am the author of Out of the Closet and Into the Streets: Why We Need to Practice Rainbow Feminism. I wrote this book because as a young adult,  struggling to both define myself as a feminist and navigate my Queer identity, I often found myself asking larger identity questions about the kind of world I want to help build. Motivated by an authentic desire to communicate my beliefs about the direction of feminism, this book is my contribution to the future. My hope is that, in reading this book, you will question the binaries that seem so fundamental to the constructions of Western society. In this book, I hope to instil in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the future of the Feminist movement and Queer liberation. Ultimately, I want you to see my work as a tool to help you understand the current relationship between the feminist movement and the LGBTQPIA2+ community but also as a challenge to traditional white-woman feminism that failed Queer, disabled, socio-economically disenfranchised and racial/ethnic minority communities. In this book, you'll think about the true origins of knowledge and challenge the institutions of power that govern our relationships, not just with society and others but with ourselves. You'll hear stories from classic feminist thinkers, like Audre Lorde, and more contemporary scholars, like Sara Ahmed, on the evolving discourse of the liberation movement.If you are Queer or if you are a feminist, if you know it all or if you know nothing, this book is for you. I know that you will love this book if you want to critically analyze gender, Queerness and feminism in our current socio-political context.Out of the Closet and Into the Streets:  Why We Need to Practice Rainbow Feminism is a nonfiction book that speaks to the academic community and general public alike by distilling scholarly discourse in a digestible and approachable medium. For those who want to challenge their own subconscious bias, internalized misogyny, and compulsory heterosexuality (all terms I will discuss throughout the book--no worries if you are unfamiliar) my book is for you. What I Need & What You'll GetMy book will be published with New Degree Press and I already have a publishing contract.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>How do I navigate a space that historically wasn't created for me nor do I have the tools for?</p>
<p>My name is Eriana James and I am the author of <i>The 4-Year Ride</i>. I wrote this book because there was not a blueprint for first-generation and minority students transitioning to college. This was something I struggled with during various points of my academic career. I feel compelled to share my experiences through this “four year ride“ in hopes that it will be beneficial to those who may be able to relate to my story.</p>
<p><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that you are not alone in this experience. The journey will have its ups and downs, but that is only to test your will to succeed, not just academically but personally. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to engage with the themes of; “storm before the calm”, which is dealing with adversity before anything gets better, “am I enough”, which deals with questioning one’s self-worth and whether they belong in an environment; and “cheers to the mayhem“ which is the growth and celebratory section of the book. It deals with realizing the lessons learned from experiencing adversity and being able to be comfortable in the uncomfortable.</p>

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p>Skulls and Hibiscus is meant to be a self-reflection for those affected by mental health struggles in everyday life. This collection of poems serve as a guide to rediscovery within oneself. It is to ease hopeless romantics, people-pleasers, and over-thinkers so that they know that their feelings are valid.<br/><br/>My name is Heather Vazquez and I am the author of Skulls and Hibiscus. I wrote this book because I wanted to create a manuscript relatable for young adults such as myself. We live in a society where mental health is still a taboo, encouraging us to cope with life through technology and fake smiles. My hope for this book is that it pushes my audience to speak up for how they’re feeling, whether it is positive or negative. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover your own voice. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to release any tensions in your heart and to confront the emotional despairs of life, but realize there are moments of light laced within it.<br/><br/>In this book, you’ll join me in exploring love, youth, and how the struggles of mental health affect relationships and oneself through poems like: </p>
<p>“A Young Confession” — A hopeless romantic who finally realizes their self-worth knowing that they, along with the person they're pursuing, have flaws, but finds that they are perfect for one another.</p>
<p>“Short-lived” — People may believe that getting old is something to fear, but they must remember that there is beauty in aging along with the world around us.</p>
<p>“Parents” — This piece is meant to connect with those who believe they are not adequate enough for their parental figures. Whether it is academically or socially, there are children who try their hardest achieve pride from a parent, seeking validation even if they are already doing all they can.</p>
<p><br/>You will love this book if you enjoy romance, self-reflection, psychology, and philosophy. Skulls and Hibiscus speaks to hopeless romantics and over-thinkers who want to deal with their mental and emotional health in a new and healthier way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that Skulls and Hibiscus inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<p>Why should mental health be talked about more?</p>
<p>Is there a difference between idealized and romanticized love?</p>
<p>How does society behave around the stigma of mental health?</p>
<p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing mental health and its affects on love and behavior will change us all for the better. <br/> </p>

The project seeks to raise $20,000 for seed funding which will be used to expand our staff and to expand our marketing efforts on both sides of the Pacific, culminating with the site launch, scheduled for August 6, 2020.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Book Summary</h3>
<p><i>""The sea is calling, answer your heart.""</i></p>
<p>Ava’s life is thrown into a tailspin when she not only moves in with the family who hopes to adopt her, but also as she experiences mysterious changes.</p>
<p>First, she sees glimmering tattoos all over her body and then she starts experiencing excruciating pain when her skin touches water. Her social worker, Nerissa knows more about Ava than she should, and she eventually gives Ava three items that help her uncover her true identity. As Ava learns more about herself and her past, she must decide, stay with the family she’s growing to love or return to the family that gave her up as a child. Ava’s only hoped for one thing her entire life, a family to accept and welcome her.</p>
<p>Now faced with the indecision of who to choose, Ava’s life and the life of her loved ones are in danger, and all at the hand of someone near to her heart.</p>
<p><strong>About Project Glimmer</strong></p>
<p>This debut YA novel follows a young girl’s need to be loved and accepted. Yet the protagonist discovers that her own strength and identity are all she ever needed.</p>
<p>With similarities to The Girl the Sea Gave Back, by Adrienne Young, and Water So Deep, by Nichole Giles, you’ll find a story of a brave teen who learns to embrace herself and who steps into her rightful role.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Project Glimmer will be released in <strong>two episodes</strong> (shorter books that will later be bound up together as one completed novel). This campaign if completely funded will 100% fund the first episode, which is what you'll get access to depending on your tier.</p>

<h3>Why I'm Pre-Selling My Book This Way</h3>
<p>I've decided to go the self-publishing route instead of the traditional publishing route, as I believe that my years in business will help me market my books well. But with self-publishing, it can be difficult to get that first book off the ground. Here's why I've decided to pre-sell my book in a crowdfunding campaign:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are costs that occur when you self-publish books, and while I can cut corners as much as possible, there are a few one-time costs that will help set my career up for success if I purchase them in the beginning.  For example, there's a software called Vellum Press that will help me to format my books myself. This program will help me format all my books for years to come. By helping me through this campaign, I'll be able to acquire this program and other necessities that  will make self-publishing so much easier.</li>
<li>With pre-selling my book this way, I'm setting my book up for much bigger success than just posting it to Amazon and crossing my fingers. My goal with this campaign is to get my book out and into the hands of readers (aka - you!) right away. </li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">By sharing my book in this way, I also get to create a lot of cool stuff to go along with it (such as bookmarks, enamel pins, and book totes). These additional perks probably wouldn't come to fruition until much later in my publishing journey without a campaign like this. Not only will this campaign push me to create all these fun perks in the first place, but it also helps me to create the buzz necessary to launch a book in a fun and exciting way. By creating this book merchandise, I can also do things like giveaways on my social media.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">If I don't reach my goal amount, the funds I do raise here will go strictly to editing Episode 1 and getting character art created.</span></li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">What Your Contributions Help Me To Do</span></h3>
<h3><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">With your contributions, I'll be able to self-publish the first episode of my story by being able to pay for the following costs:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Pay for a developmental edit and a copy edit of the first two episodes (Estimated cost: $1,500)</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Pay for the character art that will go on my covers and on all my book merchandise (Estimated cost: $900)</span></li>
<li><font>Purchase the ISBNs for my paperback books (Cost: $295)</font></li>
<li><font>Purchase a copy of Vellum Press to help me format my books (Cost: $250, this is a one-time cost that will be beneficial to my entire author career)</font></li>
<li><font>Pay for printing of all paperback books, book merchandise, and to pay for shipping to get these perks to you</font></li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>In this section, I want to share with you the risk and challenges that I may face with publishing and launching and what that means for you as an individual contributing to this campaign:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><strong>Challenge #1</strong> - I want the first episode of my book edited and ready for publication by January 2021. </span><ul>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The challenge with this is that if I <i>can't</i> get enough funds to pay for the editing, then I will have to delay the publication date. </span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The good news is that I've already secured my editors and that the cost is reasonable. </span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I have this campaign, along with other avenues to help gather the funds to make this happen. I don't expect there to be any delays, but you never know.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""><strong>Challenge #2</strong> - If I don't get the full amount that I'm asking for with this campaign, the second episode will definitely be delayed for publication. </span><ul><li><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">​Because this campaign is primarily to help me launch the first episode, the second episode isn't my primary focus. But any delays to episode one will significantly delay the second episode.</span></li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>

""The sea is calling, answer your heart.""
Ava’s life is thrown into a tailspin when she not only moves in with the family who hopes to adopt her, but also as she experiences mysterious changes.
First, she sees glimmering tattoos all over her body and then she starts experiencing excruciating pain when her skin touches water. Her social worker, Nerissa knows more about Ava than she should, and she eventually gives Ava three items that help her uncover her true identity. As Ava learns more about herself and her past, she must decide, stay with the family she’s growing to love or return to the family that gave her up as a child. Ava’s only hoped for one thing her entire life, a family to accept and welcome her.
Now faced with the indecision of who to choose, Ava’s life and the life of her loved ones are in danger, and all at the hand of someone near to her heart.
About Project Glimmer
This debut YA novel follows a young girl’s need to be loved and accepted. Yet the protagonist discovers that her own strength and identity are all she ever needed.
With similarities to The Girl the Sea Gave Back, by Adrienne Young, and Water So Deep, by Nichole Giles, you’ll find a story of a brave teen who learns to embrace herself and who steps into her rightful role.
Note: Project Glimmer will be released in two episodes (shorter books that will later be bound up together as one completed novel). This campaign if completely funded will 100% fund the first episode, which is what you'll get access to depending on your tier.

Amanda Creek is currently attending Southern New Hampshire University to obtain her Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing, where she's working on this novel for her Thesis project. When she's not writing, Amanda operates her business where she helps creative female entrepreneurs share their creative talent and skills through online marketing efforts.

Why I'm Pre-Selling My Book This Way
I've decided to go the self-publishing route instead of the traditional publishing route, as I believe that my years in business will help me market my books well. But with self-publishing, it can be difficult to get that first book off the ground. Here's why I've decided to pre-sell my book in a crowdfunding campaign:

There are costs that occur when you self-publish books, and while I can cut corners as much as possible, there are a few one-time costs that will help set my career up for success if I purchase them in the beginning.  For example, there's a software called Vellum Press that will help me to format my books myself. This program will help me format all my books for years to come. By helping me through this campaign, I'll be able to acquire this program and other necessities that  will make self-publishing so much easier.
With pre-selling my book this way, I'm setting my book up for much bigger success than just posting it to Amazon and crossing my fingers. My goal with this campaign is to get my book out and into the hands of readers (aka - you!) right away. 
By sharing my book in this way, I also get to create a lot of cool stuff to go along with it (such as bookmarks, enamel pins, and book totes). These additional perks probably wouldn't come to fruition until much later in my publishing journey without a campaign like this. Not only will this campaign push me to create all these fun perks in the first place, but it also helps me to create the buzz necessary to launch a book in a fun and exciting way. By creating this book merchandise, I can also do things like giveaways on my social media.
If I don't reach my goal amount, the funds I do raise here will go strictly to editing Episode 1 and getting character art created.


What Your Contributions Help Me To Do
With your contributions, I'll be able to self-publish the first episode of my story by being able to pay for the following costs:

Pay for a developmental edit and a copy edit of the first two episodes (Estimated cost: $1,500)
Pay for the character art that will go on my covers and on all my book merchandise (Estimated cost: $900)
Purchase the ISBNs for my paperback books (Cost: $295)
Purchase a copy of Vellum Press to help me format my books (Cost: $250, this is a one-time cost that will be beneficial to my entire author career)
Pay for printing of all paperback books, book merchandise, and to pay for shipping to get these perks to you


Risks & Challenges
In this section, I want to share with you the risk and challenges that I may face with publishing and launching and what that means for you as an individual contributing to this campaign:


Challenge #1 - I want the first episode of my book edited and ready for publication by January 2021. 
The challenge with this is that if I can't get enough funds to pay for the editing, then I will have to delay the publication date. 
The good news is that I've already secured my editors and that the cost is reasonable. 
I have this campaign, along with other avenues to help gather the funds to make this happen. I don't expect there to be any delays, but you never know.



Challenge #2 - If I don't get the full amount that I'm asking for with this campaign, the second episode will definitely be delayed for publication. ​Because this campaign is primarily to help me launch the first episode, the second episode isn't my primary focus. But any delays to episode one will significantly delay the second episode.



Other Ways You Can Help
I understand that not everyone can contribute financially, but there are other ways that you can help! The things listed below will help more than you can ever imagine...

Share with your friends and followers on all your social accounts. The more people that see this campaign, the closer I'll get to reaching my goal. You can easily share the campaign by clicking on the share tools at the top of this page.
Leave a review when you do read my book. If you decide to wait until my book is published to pick up your own copy, please help me out by leaving a review on Amazon or Goodreads. These reviews help me out by letting other readers know that you enjoyed my book, plus it makes my book easier to find when people search on Amazon and other sites.

Thank you so, so much!",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Welcome to Wonder Valley</strong></p>
<p>You might have passed through there, maybe. Out for a drive with time on your hands you might have noticed the abandoned homestead shacks crumbling along a grid of dirt tracks scraped into this corner of the Mojave Desert. Wonder Valley. It’s a place peopled by a menagerie of misfits and miscreants, artists and retirees, methheads and the otherwise marginalized. They live in the derelict cabins, fixing them up, some, or just making do in others. And while most landed here because it’s cheap—the cheapest real estate in all of California--that’s not what they’d tell you. They’d tell you they came looking for a freedom elsewhere unavailable or to escape the conformist pressures of mainstream America. They’d say they came for the changing colors of the desert sunsets or some sense of authenticity, bedrock, the real deal, life and death and heat and grit.</p>
<p>I myself came to Wonder Valley to investigate the death of Ricka McGuire, on assignment, ostensibly, with a magazine distributed on the streets of Denver by the homeless. Really, though, I felt drawn to this place. My life was falling apart—I’d lost a fortune in the Great Recession, my marriage was inexplicably unbearable, and my own sense of self had become vacuous, empty. I felt an outcast in my own skin. In Wonder Valley, though, I sensed a kinship with those I met. They walked the edge of an abyss out there, an abyss I felt drawn to, one I needed to peer down into.</p>
<p>Ricka McGuire’s story had struck me as wildly outlandish at first. She’d lived in a broken-down school bus, no electricity or running water. Aged and destitute, she succumbed to the heat. That someone could die so easily here in America, in California of all places, shocked me. How could anyone let this happen?</p>
<p>From that first encounter, though, Wonder Valley had a hold on me. I found it haunting and otherworldly, almost unbelievable in its strangeness. It was like a lost island, a desert Galapagos in a sea of sand. I appointed myself its Darwin. In its isolation a people had evolved, a breed apart from mainstream society, many of them living like Ricka, on this edge, walking that dangerous precipice between life and death.</p>
<p>I spent years in Wonder Valley immersed in and documenting the resilience and humanity of these people in the face of mental illness, alcoholism, poverty, and neglect, until the line between my reporting on and becoming one of them blurred. As a microcosm of society, Wonder Valley suffered the economic tides flowing across the country most acutely. The people’s tenuous existence there coupled with the pervading media and political rhetoric exacerbated the deep, unending unease washing over America. Like the rest of us, the people out there had all seen the bottom drop out of the economy and a great uncertainty fill the void. Those who had anything at all worried about losing it, their incomes, their homes, their health. Many became mired in the sense that should they fall, they may never get back up. As a reaction, the artists and retirees and society’s forgotten each bunkered into separate communities, members limiting themselves to those of their own, avoiding and even disparaging as illegitimate the lives of the others, leading to the most extreme of economic outcomes: Survival on the backs of the weak.</p>
<p>WELCOME TO WONDER VALLEY is a completed manuscript ready to be published as a book. In the vein of <i>Hillbilly Elegy </i>and the work of Michael Perry and writers like William Vollman, Ted Conover, and William Finnegan, it explores a darker side of the American dream, a side so pervasive, yet so largely unacknowledged by major media. Interwoven with the memoir of my own fall and recovery from financial and personal crises, the book looks at life in a place where the safety net barely exists and falling through the cracks is too often fatal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>About the Me</strong></p>
<p>Prior to embarking on this project, I worked as a day laborer, a handyman, and in a guitar factory. I ran an environmental consulting firm, a restaurant, huge call centers, and hired, trained, and mentored hundreds of employees. I also made and lost a fortune in real estate, casting me into the downward spiral that sparked this Wonder Valley odyssey.</p>
<p>An avid traveler, I have visited more than forty countries on five continents. I’ve crossed the equator by plane, boat, bus, and on foot. I’ve battled forty-foot seas in a thirty-five-foot sailboat, been chased by a wild orangutan in a Sumatran jungle, stared into the black pupil of a rebel Kalashnikov in the rainforest of Guatemala.  </p>

<p><strong>You are helping me reach my project budget of $15,000. Please enjoy the book and other offerings for your contribution.  </strong></p>
<p><i>Where your money goes:</i></p>
<p>Your funds will help produce, print and ship the book to people who need it the most. 200 copies of the first printing will be donated to 20 different hospice centers and grief-support groups throughout the United States.</p>
<p>Your funds will help bring the companion website, <a href=""http://www.thegriefpractice.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TheGriefPractice.com</a>, online and available as an interactive, 24-hour support that will give an ongoing voice to grief through human stories and offer practice videos that support grief in the body.</p>
<p><i>What is so unique about the book?</i></p>
<p>The Grief Practice applies modern movement science and neuroscience to the ancient practices of yoga and mindfulness in an uncomplicated and beautiful way, creating an accessible path to grief through yoga designed to welcome grief. The <i>Stories</i> section delivers comfort, compassion, and hope through other stories of survival and invites the reader to open to it as they are ready.</p>
<p>The book peels back the layers of the most feared emotion along the spectrum of being human - grief - and proposes a way to welcome it back to the table of public life, right between love and joy. It invites the reader to become part of the story by adding their experience, feelings, and photos to blank and lined pages, thereby turning a book that holds other peoples' stories into a book that holds their story.</p>
<p><strong>Part I: The Stories</strong></p>
<p>Part I of the book gives grief a voice through the stories of twenty-one humans who have lost a loved one in death. Photographs and hand-drawn art accompany the stories so as to most accurately convey the storyteller’s unedited heart.</p>
<p>These stories are raw and beautiful. They are both tragic and so full of hope.</p>
<p>There are blank and lined pages for the reader to write in their own story, to add their photos or mementos, because it is meant to come alive in their hands.</p>
<p><strong>Part II: The Practices</strong></p>
<p>Part II of the book is trauma-sensitive yoga and mindfulness practices specific to grief laid out over three chapters.</p>
<p><i>Chapter 1, Grief In The Body, </i>takes the reader on a tour through grief in the body, breaking down concepts of neuroscience and movement science into relatable, comprehensible bites, creating a framework for exploring grief in the body that feels both safe and supportive.<br/><br/><i>Chapter 2, Organs Of Grief,</i> highlights five different organs in the body, exploring their scientific and energetic components as it relates to grief. They are accompanied by hand-detailed art that speaks to both the anatomy and energy these organs hold. There is a “Map Your Own Grief” section where the reader can explore grief in their own body and map what shows up and how it changes from day to day.</p>
</div><div>
<p><i>Chapter 3, Yoga,</i> invites the reader to explore the practices of yoga and mindfulness through a trauma-sensitive lens, beginning with an explanation of anchors and how to use them both on and off the yoga mat. There is a section of supported, still shapes and practices and a section on active, moving shapes because sometimes in our grief we need stillness and sometimes in our grief we need movement.</p>
<p><i>Who am I?</i></p>
<p>My name is Monique Minahan. I am a registered yoga teacher in Carlsbad, California. For the last several years I have been piecing together an approach to grief through yoga, informed by research on trauma in the body and neuroscience, that welcomes it and acknowledges the innate healing ability of every human being and every human body.</p>
<p>For the last decade I have been motivated to create a book that would be a soft place for grief to land and feel its way through the dark, nonlinear process of healing and living with loss.  </p>

<p><strong><em>Suzanne Paschall, Indie Ink Publishing</em> </strong> <br/><br/>Hi, I'm Suzanne Paschall, founder of Indie Ink Publishing, a small company in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. I'm here to introduce to you a very special book written by a very special lady.  </p>
<p>But first, a little about us so you know where we're coming from and why we are pitching together with Treena. Indie Ink is three years old, and in that time, we have collaboratively published 7 titles with some really fresh authors who, while they are are from our province, have ideas and content that expand far beyond our prairie borders. <br/><br/>We work in a wonderful creative and business partnership with our authors (like Treena, who you'll meet in the video here) which means we take equal risk with them, either financially on in-kind in services they provide, and then we share equally in the rewards. Everyone on the book project team brings all of their creative and business experience to the table and we all benefit from our various kinds of expertise. We bring our editorial, marketing, new book forms and distribution expertise to the table, and our authors bring not only their book content and author profiles, but in many cases their own sets of other skills. <br/><br/><strong><em>Treena Wynes, Author, Eating Myself Crazy</em></strong></p>
<p>Treena Wynes is an amazing person. I call her one of those ""angels on earth"". She doesn't know she is, but I do. She moves through life bringing a peaceful feeling to those around her. She makes you feel good just by being in her aura. She has been through hell, more than once, in more than one way, and she has slogged through it. And she's done something even more amazing: she's come through it with the most positive attitude I've ever seen. She's made it her business to help other people. But not in a preachy, annoying way. In a sweet, quiet, funny, sometimes goofy, always diva-devoid Treena-way. She's a mom, a wife, a friend, a counsellor, a survivor, an activist and now, soon to be, an author. </p>
<p><em><strong>I invite you to meet Treena up close and personal in the pitch video...there's a good chance you'll be able to relate to some of the people featured...</strong></em></p>
<h3><strong>About the Book:</strong></h3>
<p>Writing about this journey and putting down her tips, and recipes and tidbits of information into this tidy book along with her own graphic and personal story is the personification of Treena herself: it's sweet, funny, honest and...ultimately, helpful and hopeful.</p>
<p>First, Treena tells her own story, no holds barred. It's graphic, and as true as true gets. Then, she shares information in easy to understand portion sizes about a number of eating-related issues that she found confusing and complex. She then provides a number of tips and recipes and even provides journal space for readers to make their own comments and plans for their healthy future.</p>
<h3>What We Hope:</h3>
<p>I believe this book is going to help a lot of people. Not just people who have terrible eating disorders, bless them, but so many of us who struggle daily with emotional eating issues--as we say in the marketing material: those of us who, having had a crappy week with the job and the kids and who knows what else, come home on Friday and shovel down an extra-large bag of nacho chips and polish it off with a pint of Rocky Road. We know who we are. We feel like ARGH after, and we don't know why.<br/><br/>Well, Treena does, and this book is for anyone (male, female; older, younger) who understands that scenario or any like it. There are a lot of books in this category by authorities (doctors, nurses, nutritionists, dieticians, researchers), and these are very valuable...but Treena wanted to write something from a different perspective: something that wasn't intimidating and so overwhelming and complex to someone who was already confused, scared and suffering. So Eating Myself Crazy is purposely NOT any of those things.</p>

Suzanne Paschall, Indie Ink Publishing  Hi, I'm Suzanne Paschall, founder of Indie Ink Publishing, a small company in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. I'm here to introduce to you a very special book written by a very special lady.  
But first, a little about us so you know where we're coming from and why we are pitching together with Treena. Indie Ink is three years old, and in that time, we have collaboratively published 7 titles with some really fresh authors who, while they are are from our province, have ideas and content that expand far beyond our prairie borders. We work in a wonderful creative and business partnership with our authors (like Treena, who you'll meet in the video here) which means we take equal risk with them, either financially on in-kind in services they provide, and then we share equally in the rewards. Everyone on the book project team brings all of their creative and business experience to the table and we all benefit from our various kinds of expertise. We bring our editorial, marketing, new book forms and distribution expertise to the table, and our authors bring not only their book content and author profiles, but in many cases their own sets of other skills. Treena Wynes, Author, Eating Myself Crazy
Treena Wynes is an amazing person. I call her one of those ""angels on earth"". She doesn't know she is, but I do. She moves through life bringing a peaceful feeling to those around her. She makes you feel good just by being in her aura. She has been through hell, more than once, in more than one way, and she has slogged through it. And she's done something even more amazing: she's come through it with the most positive attitude I've ever seen. She's made it her business to help other people. But not in a preachy, annoying way. In a sweet, quiet, funny, sometimes goofy, always diva-devoid Treena-way. She's a mom, a wife, a friend, a counsellor, a survivor, an activist and now, soon to be, an author. 
I invite you to meet Treena up close and personal in the pitch video...there's a good chance you'll be able to relate to some of the people featured...
About the Book:
Writing about this journey and putting down her tips, and recipes and tidbits of information into this tidy book along with her own graphic and personal story is the personification of Treena herself: it's sweet, funny, honest and...ultimately, helpful and hopeful.
First, Treena tells her own story, no holds barred. It's graphic, and as true as true gets. Then, she shares information in easy to understand portion sizes about a number of eating-related issues that she found confusing and complex. She then provides a number of tips and recipes and even provides journal space for readers to make their own comments and plans for their healthy future.
What We Hope:
I believe this book is going to help a lot of people. Not just people who have terrible eating disorders, bless them, but so many of us who struggle daily with emotional eating issues--as we say in the marketing material: those of us who, having had a crappy week with the job and the kids and who knows what else, come home on Friday and shovel down an extra-large bag of nacho chips and polish it off with a pint of Rocky Road. We know who we are. We feel like ARGH after, and we don't know why.Well, Treena does, and this book is for anyone (male, female; older, younger) who understands that scenario or any like it. There are a lot of books in this category by authorities (doctors, nurses, nutritionists, dieticians, researchers), and these are very valuable...but Treena wanted to write something from a different perspective: something that wasn't intimidating and so overwhelming and complex to someone who was already confused, scared and suffering. So Eating Myself Crazy is purposely NOT any of those things.
Where Your Money Will Go:
1.  Book design & printing 
2.  Marketing materials (bookmarks, posters for bookstore promotion)
3.  Launch event costs
4.  Marketing/publicity costs 
Book making and marketing is an increasingly expensive enterprise and (you may not know this) a really difficult business to actually make money at. In particular for a small indie publisher with no deep pockets (unlike a Random House or S&S), as we don't have months to wait for the orders that are taken when we publish a book to finally end up in cheques on our doorstep. Book selling is basically a consignment business...Retailers and wholesalers order our books and we ship them, but they don't actually PAY us for them for months, sometimes up to half a year or longer, for those books. And then, if they don't sell them, they return them.
And as we share equally in our profits with our authors, the more successful our marketing efforts are, the more successful the book is, and the more successful we and our authors are. 
Most importantly, the message of hope and inspiration that is Treena's goal only gets to the most people possible if our distribution, sales, marketing and publicity efforts are successful.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><em>The ground gave way. There was a burst of fire like dragon’s breath, and I fell.</em></p>
<p><em> I don’t remember landing, only silence and darkness. We were in a cave, the ceiling lit by blue phosphorescence. For a long time, I just lay there, too stunned to move or breathe. I remember coughing, drawing air into lungs gone tingly with pins and needles. It burned like dying and then coming back to life. Something nearby was drip-drip-dripping into a puddle near my head. There were other people breathing, and a few sniffles. Something terrible had happened. </em></p>
<p><em>--Joanna Sanderson, Dragon Breath Part One: Pawns</em></p>
<p>Joanna Sanderson didn't have high expectations for her junior year. Between overly critical teachers and her natural impulse for mayhem, all Jo could count on was detention, a handful of smoke bombs, and a passing grade won by the skin of her teeth.</p>
<p>She certainly didn't expect to be kidnapped by dragons.</p>
<p>Now she and her classmates are caught in a game of intrigue and trapped on an alien world. The Dragon Queen wants the kids to become her riders...and the others want human as their very next meal. But if anybody can make it home, it'll be the girl that pranked the entire Junior Prom. It says don't mettle in the affairs of dragons...but the dragons aren't giving Jo a choice.</p>
<p>Maybe they should have said something about messing with Joanna Sanderson.</p>
<p><em>Dragon Breath </em>is a YA fantasy adventure written by me, myself and I. My name is Chelsea Gaither. I've self published eleven novella leingth books in the past year, with mild-to-moderate success. </p>
<p>With <em>Dragon Breath</em>, I'm trying to take things to the next professional level. I promised my readers this book would be professionally edited, and it is. The first third, <em>Part One: Pawns</em>, has been edited, fully prepaired, and will be published on August 5th, 2013.</p>
<p>But this is where you come in.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><em>I dressed up as a fictional girl, rather than a fictional me, to say I am not like you. I am not more special or more brilliant or rich or beautiful or whatever, but I am not like you. I am not a tool. I am not a breeder.</em></p>
<p><em>I put glue in the bubble machines because making a statement blows when no one is looking.</em></p>
<p><em>--Joanna Sanderson, Part One: Pawns</em></p>
<p>Editing is expensive. I'm a 27 year old waitress in South Texas. The next third, <em>Part Two: Knights</em>, will cost just under 500 dollars to edit. My personal resources are tapped, and with tourist season ending, I know I won't be able to afford to edit the other two thirds of <em>Dragon Breath</em>. Without your help, I'll be breaking a promise to my readers. And I <em>never </em>break those promises</p>
<p>I need $500 in 30 days. This money would go towards editing <em>Dragon's Breath, </em><em>Part two: Knights</em>. Anything left over would go towads editing <em>Part Three: Queens</em>. </p>
<p>In return, you will get an e-copy of <em>Part Two</em>. Even if all you give me is a dollar. You help fund the book, you get a copy of the book. Donate more, and it goes up.</p>
<p>Five dollars gets both <em>Part one </em>and <em>Part two</em>.</p>
<p>Donate ten dollars, and you get all three parts, delivered on publication.</p>
Fifteen dollars, you get all of <em>Dragon Breath</em>, as well as an omnibus of a previously released sci-fi series, <em>Starbleached.</em>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Twenty dollars, you get all of Dragon Breath, the sci-fi omnibus and my previously published urban fantasy series omnibus, <em>Silver Bullet, Black Hounds: The Exiles Omnibus</em>.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Fifty dollars gets everything above, plus a signed 10 by 15 print of <em>Dragon Breath's </em>cover art.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>100 dollars gets everything above, plus a signed 20 by 30 art print of Joanna Sanderson with the Dragon Queen.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And just for reading this and watching the video, you get a free copy of <em>Starbleached. </em>Drop on over to Smashwords.com and use this coupon: MP72H<br/><br/>
</div>
<div>Of course, there's always the chance I won't meet the goal. Well, even $200 would help. All money raised by this campaign will go to finance books, be it two dollars or two hundred thousand dollars. It won't go to cookies, or burgers, or rent money. </div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><em>“How could you stand it? We’re living a fantasy novel. Why would you want to be reminded?” Christie said.</em></p>
<p><em> Silence as we all considered this. </em></p>
<p><em>“Because someday, we’re not going to be in high school anymore,” Billy said. “We’re going to be sitting behind a desk or pushing a broom or giving someone stitches, or doing something else that our parents and grandparents called important. We’re gonna realize that other than learning, school is really just place-holding, and that all the fashion statements we can make are really just cookie-cutter emblems in a factory world. And we’re going to remember this.” He stood up and walked a bit farther toward the star. Then he turned around and raised both arms to the sky. “We’re here. Under this neon periwinkle sky. We got dragged here, yeah, but we got dragged on dragonback. We’re on a quest, guys. We’re following our own goddamned star. And one day when we’re home and we’ve got coffee and faucets and indoor plumbing, we’re gonna know that we did it. We were here. All six of us.” </em></p>

<p><em>--Paraphrase of G.K. Chesterton.<br/></em></p>
<p><em><br/></em>Stories are important. They run deeper than we know. I don't pretend to be a great writer, but I do hope that I am a good one...at minimum, good enough to give hope to a handful of dragonslayers who need it. </p>
<p>I come from a background that includes addiction, recovery, insanity and mental health. I beleive that stories, even poorly written ones, have their greatest value not in the content itself, but in the seeds they plant in the minds and hearts of readers. Sometimes the seeds are good, sometimes they're bad. My goal with this project is to plant more positive seeds than negative ones, to portray healthy relationships, or recovery from toxic ones. </p>
<p>And also tell a damn good fantasy story. </p>
<p>I have released 11 books, 12 if you're reading this after August 5th. I have delayed a promised release date exactly once, when I moved <em>Dragon Breath's </em>release date from July 17th to August 5th, to give the editor time to work. By supporting this project you are supporting quality in independant and self-publishing. You are supporting the dreams of a Texas waitress, and you are supporting the readers, both now and in the future, who will read and be touched by the story in <em>Dragon Breath </em>and in my other projects.</p>
<p>I will make this project happen. What I cannot do is make this project a strong success without the help and support of people like you.</p>

<p>Hello Rad Dad supporter!</p>
<p>I am writing with some exciting news. <a href=""http://raddadzine.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Rad Dad is just about to release its 24th issue this June</a>; it’s one of the best issues so far. </p>
<p>However, I have been thinking about retiring Rad Dad at the 25<sup>th</sup> issue. But as I shared the idea with a few close friends, they encouraged me to re-consider that decision, perhaps to even try something different, something bigger. To move from being a zine to being a magazine.</p>
<p>And, yeah, I do want to expand the reach of Rad Dad, broadening the community of parents we have worked to create. I want Rad Dad in bookstores and grocery stores across the country, in small towns and big cities.  </p>
<p>Some things will change.  But what won't change is this: </p>
<ul>
<li>Rad Dad will still be submission based.</li>
<li>Rad Dad will remain rad as in radical, not cool</li>
<li>Rad Dad will continue to present a wide range of voices and experiences, challenging the mainstream stereotypical representation of fatherhood.</li>
<li>Rad Dad will always need you.</li>
</ul>
<p>So with that said, I am unveiling the new incarnation of Rad Dad:</p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>Rad Dad, a Zine for Rad Dads, Hip Mamas, and Everyone In-between.</em></strong></p>
<p>Beginning with issue 25, I want a redesigned look, modeled after magazines that inspire me like <em>Bitch</em>, <em>Hip Mama</em> and <em>Hyphen</em>. To do so, I will need a graphic designer, a small collective of editors, subscription options, but most of all – you.</p>
<p>I will need your help!  Here’s how...</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>I need $10,000 to pay for a graphic designer to create a new look for Rad Dad, cover the initial printing costs in order to increase our distribution, and to pay a small stipend to contributors and editors for their work.</p>
<p>When you donate to the campaign, you will have your choice of gifts: amazing diy zines, publications, tote bags and t-shirts carrying the Rad Dad message. They are full of the authentic voices and stories that have made Rad Dad so popular.</p>
<p>We're going forward with the relaunch of Rad Dad this coming December.  Every dollar you contribute will help us along the way.  Be part of our Rad Dad family and join us in expanding the community we all want to be a part of!</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>

<p>In Aug-Dec 2012 Technology For a New Future was published by Adam's small startup publishing company - Solomon Books. Adam is trying to raise funds for a small book publishing label ""SOLOMON BOOKS"" that would allow other authors like himself to publish their work. To start things off Adam has proposed to reprint his first edition in a second edition print run of this book. By raising $8000 here at indiegogo Adam plans to print 500 copies of his Technology For a New Future book. He knows that each one can retail at $100 and the audience generally is interested in the work that he has sold out of the previous book, but last time Adam only printed 20. This time he will print 500. <br/><br/>If you can help adam do this that means he will make $100 on 500 books and raise a total of $50,000 to get his livelyhood running.<br/><br/><em>""The scientific man does not aim at an immediate result.

<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>After a successful first edition we need to print more than just 24 copies in a 2nd edition of our first published book Technology For a New Future. The total cost for 500 copies of a 555 page full colour book is about $8000.00</p>
<p>If you contribute $500 or more to this campaign we will send you the first edition of Technology For a New Future as a big thank you, which retailed at $100 until it sold out between DEC 2012 - JAN 2013.</p>

<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>No organisation like Solomon Books has ever existed. (Occult &amp; New Age Bookstore &amp; Online Publisher)</p>
<p>Technology For a New Future 1st edition retailed at $100 + P&amp;P , sold 20 copies in just 1 month, and raised a significant amount of money, over $2000.00 . Unfortunately the author was not attempting to make money and the costs associated with printing and selling just 20 books only amounted to about £600 profit. The author and founder of Solomon Books and Technology For a New Future had to give up work for a year to produce the book and setup the business. Solomon books had been trading since Dec 2012 as a sole trader, and by helping Adam you can increase the number to 500 book prints which is significantly more profitable for author and would allow Solomon Books to compete with other leading titles in volume.<br/><br/>""We cannot do it without you - the impact would be huge."" - Adam Bull<br/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://dailycensored.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/dr-martin-luther-king-jr-quote.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>""Today's scientists have substituted mathematics for experiments, and they wander off through equation after equation, and eventually build a structure which has no relation to reality"" – The World by Nikola Tesla, Modern Mechanics"" – Jul 1934</p>

<p><br/>When I first started writing Technology For a New Future I had no idea what I had re-discovered, I should say re-discovered. I did not know that earthquakes produced about a million amperes of electricity underneath the ground when an electrical apparatus above the ground shook the ground violently enough at the correct standing wave ratio. Imagine faster than light transmitters, gravity transmitter telescopes and curving light with an electromagnet and you are still not close to the profoundness of TEchnology For a New Future.<br/><br/>In my book I re-discovered that mass does not produce radioactivity, that light is not primary, that electrons can turn around 180 degrees and go back into the conductor they are leaving. and that they are 2 different currents other than A.C and D.C. That is there are different forms of electricity that exist other than what you can read on the multimeter. Like the electricity from hydroelectricity in the ocean - for instance - that comes from the moon - wirelessly, and then it turns into a moving ocean, and then it drives a dynamo to make electricity in a hydro-electric power station. <br/><br/>Tesla found a way to stand in between. That is what the Technology For a NEw Future is about. But that is just to start. Things like radiocarbon dating, and the decay of mass being controlled by external cosmic rays from other planets, stars, etc? It changes the nature of all science, even archaelogical forensic science needs to be adjusted.<br/><br/>My book is the begining of this revolutionary theory of Nuclear Physics. Light is not primary to stars, Mass does not produce it's own radioactivity. Radium when sufficiently shielded from the rays of the stars stops emitting radioactive rays - these are just the beginnings of the statements of Nikola Tesla and Eric Dollard. This is what the author writes about and is most knowledgable on the subject of, and this is why he has started Solomon Books. There was no other place for Adam. He like many others is an outcast, a rebel, but he is also a scientist a technical it consultant, a hacker who has worked for SEGA and a competent engineer.<br/><br/>I had absolutely no idea that my book would be so well received, or that my book would contain a myriad of information about the coral castle mystery that will not be found anywhere else in the world. Much fo the information is new which made it a 'cult classic' with many engineers and organisations around the world. Even the King of Hawaii was interested.<br/><br/>The truth is I am sorry - I just want to help people. Earn enough money to live, eat, and be warm, but most of all - to express myself and help other like minded individuals be able to do the same.<br/><br/>It could be a very long time (perhaps 20 or 30 years) until your book is worth something but If I am right and Einstein got it wrong about the speed of light then the work that I have catalogued will be very valuable to humanity in the future as a unique collectors item of priceless renown - who would have thought that wheatstone, tesla, dollard and leedskalnin would give the speed of light as pi / 2 * C. That is 1.57 times the speed of light that modern physics assumes to be the maximum.<br/><br/>Every day the moon uses some sort of wireless wave form (a bit like wi fi :) ) to move the trillions of watts of energy in the ocean from side to side. Instead of powering a machine from the ocean that is effected by the invisible wireless wave, Tesla, Leedskalnin and the pyramid builders found a way to intercept that invisible wireless cosmic ray that comes from the moon to make the ocean move. <br/><br/>Enough free energy to power the entire world twice over for a day is beamed down onto the ocean every minute.<br/><br/>What I have written about and suggested in my book is that instead of creating an ocean hydroelectric plant, we could go directly as Leedskalnin, Tesla, Dollard and the pyramid builders did, and intercept the wireless wave altogether - bypassing the need to abstract the energy from the secondary ocean movement from the wireless gravity wave of the moon, and instead absorb the primary cosmic ray energy that comes from every planet and star in the form of gravity.<br/><br/>Indeed- this wireless gravity wave, provides the ocean with all of it's current and movement. Without the wireless invisible gravity wave between the earth and the moon. The ocean would not move to turn around the niagra falls generator plant.<br/><br/>Tesla's greatest achievement was not the niagra falls generating plant, or even the realisation of the hydroelectric concept. Tesla's greatest achievement was bypassing the ocean current altogether, and going directly to the moon and other cosmic objects.<br/><br/>Tesla states in his research that he has  caught cosmic rays from Antarus traveling at 50C or 50 times the speed of light devised by einstein as being the fundamental limit for all waves and mass.<br/><br/>It stands to common sense that Einstein may not be entirely wrong, it may well be that the gravity wave which powers the ocean, and every hydroelectric plant in turn - is completely massless component.<br/><br/>My book takes the scientist, engineer, musician into a very strange world of technical fact, and historic quotes from mechanix magazine the New York Times and the patents and work of C.P Steinmetz and Alexanderson.<br/><br/>It shows that the electricity on planet earth, from lightning and the movement of the ocean in the trillions of watts comes solely from the cosmic rays of other stars and planets, and that the earth is like a gigantic conductor with an insulator around it called an ionosphere. Lightning being the process where the ""Solar voltage pressure"" in space exceeds the distance volume density of the insulating ionosphere of the planet, thereby causing negative electrical current to flow into the ground , usually refered to as electrons and during such a moent, an equal and opposite (gravitic) force of positive electrical current flow out of the ground in opposition, usually refered to as protons. It is infact the collision of the protons and the electrons that create the electron, which therefore whos protons and electrons are not what atoms are made of, but something that atoms can produce.<br/><br/>This does not contradict the copenhagen theory of Quantum Physics, it rather remarkably confirms it.<br/><br/>I really want more people to know about the electrical systems that I , Tesla and Dollard have been working with such as:<br/><br/></p>
<ol>
<li>Impulse Current (TESLA)</li>
<li>Direct Currents (EDISON)</li>
<li>Alternating Currents (TESLA)</li>
<li>Oscillating Currents (TESLA)</li>
</ol><p>The usual story is that most people have only heard of D.C and A.C, even scientists and engineers are not versed in oscillating currents and impulse currents. To do requires 4 quadrant theory and versor algebra. See Eric Dollards work for more information on this, as well as the Nikola Tesla patents to see that what I am saying is a fact. Impulse and Oscillating current are used in the Tesla MAgnifier Transmitter (Tesla Coil) not A.C and D.C. The Tesla Coil , in essence then, is a transformer, like the sun and the moon, the ocean and the planet is.<br/><br/>Which makes it an ideal ground conjugatation with the capacitance of the earth. Indeed why Tesla used the earths ground terminal to send electricity, because he was using the transformer of the earth, and the stars, as well as the transformer of the rotary device alone, tesla was using the transformer of the rotary planet and solar system. <br/><br/>It is likely this is in part how the Tesla Electric Car worked. Capable of 90mph, circa 1930, and traversing 1000's of miles on land before the 12V battery was changed.<br/><br/>And this is just to get started - Help Solomon Books bring this information to people and we will use the money to make this work available to you and other people through the success of Solomon Books and the 2nd edition we will be able to print a variety of books by Eric Dollard, Adam Bull, and a MYRIAD of other authors in the subject of Technology for a New Future and 'the art'.<br/><br/>Support this campaign if you support the resurrection of the 'the art'!<br/><br/><em>""</em></p>
<h2>Tesla described relativity as a 'beggar wrapped in purple whom ignorant people take for a king</h2>
<p><em>.' In support of his statement he cited a number of experiments he had conducted as far back as 1896 on the cosmic ray. He has measured cosmic-ray velocities from Antarus, he said, which he found to be fifty times greater than the speed of light, thus demolishing, he contended, one of the basic pillars of relativity, according to which there can be no speed greater than that of light.""</em> -- New York Times, 7/11/35<br/><br/><br/></p>

No organisation like Solomon Books has ever existed. (Occult & New Age Bookstore & Online Publisher)
Technology For a New Future 1st edition retailed at $100 + P&P , sold 20 copies in just 1 month, and raised a significant amount of money, over $2000.00 . Unfortunately the author was not attempting to make money and the costs associated with printing and selling just 20 books only amounted to about £600 profit. The author and founder of Solomon Books and Technology For a New Future had to give up work for a year to produce the book and setup the business. Solomon books had been trading since Dec 2012 as a sole trader, and by helping Adam you can increase the number to 500 book prints which is significantly more profitable for author and would allow Solomon Books to compete with other leading titles in volume.""We cannot do it without you - the impact would be huge."" - Adam Bull""Today's scientists have substituted mathematics for experiments, and they wander off through equation after equation, and eventually build a structure which has no relation to reality"" – The World by Nikola Tesla, Modern Mechanics"" – Jul 1934
 


Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help:
Tell friends and family about Solomon Books and Technology For a New Future, Nikola Tesla, Eric Dollard &  Edward Leedskalnin
Bring your 'fringe science' book work to us, because we are in a position today to help - and we can make the difference - and that’s all there is to it.

 
Words from the author

When I first started writing Technology For a New Future I had no idea what I had re-discovered, I should say re-discovered. I did not know that earthquakes produced about a million amperes of electricity underneath the ground when an electrical apparatus above the ground shook the ground violently enough at the correct standing wave ratio. Imagine faster than light transmitters, gravity transmitter telescopes and curving light with an electromagnet and you are still not close to the profoundness of TEchnology For a New Future.In my book I re-discovered that mass does not produce radioactivity, that light is not primary, that electrons can turn around 180 degrees and go back into the conductor they are leaving. and that they are 2 different currents other than A.C and D.C. That is there are different forms of electricity that exist other than what you can read on the multimeter. Like the electricity from hydroelectricity in the ocean - for instance - that comes from the moon - wirelessly, and then it turns into a moving ocean, and then it drives a dynamo to make electricity in a hydro-electric power station. Tesla found a way to stand in between. That is what the Technology For a NEw Future is about. But that is just to start. Things like radiocarbon dating, and the decay of mass being controlled by external cosmic rays from other planets, stars, etc? It changes the nature of all science, even archaelogical forensic science needs to be adjusted.My book is the begining of this revolutionary theory of Nuclear Physics. Light is not primary to stars, Mass does not produce it's own radioactivity. Radium when sufficiently shielded from the rays of the stars stops emitting radioactive rays - these are just the beginnings of the statements of Nikola Tesla and Eric Dollard. This is what the author writes about and is most knowledgable on the subject of, and this is why he has started Solomon Books. There was no other place for Adam. He like many others is an outcast, a rebel, but he is also a scientist a technical it consultant, a hacker who has worked for SEGA and a competent engineer.I had absolutely no idea that my book would be so well received, or that my book would contain a myriad of information about the coral castle mystery that will not be found anywhere else in the world. Much fo the information is new which made it a 'cult classic' with many engineers and organisations around the world. Even the King of Hawaii was interested.The truth is I am sorry - I just want to help people. Earn enough money to live, eat, and be warm, but most of all - to express myself and help other like minded individuals be able to do the same.It could be a very long time (perhaps 20 or 30 years) until your book is worth something but If I am right and Einstein got it wrong about the speed of light then the work that I have catalogued will be very valuable to humanity in the future as a unique collectors item of priceless renown - who would have thought that wheatstone, tesla, dollard and leedskalnin would give the speed of light as pi / 2 * C. That is 1.57 times the speed of light that modern physics assumes to be the maximum.Every day the moon uses some sort of wireless wave form (a bit like wi fi :) ) to move the trillions of watts of energy in the ocean from side to side. Instead of powering a machine from the ocean that is effected by the invisible wireless wave, Tesla, Leedskalnin and the pyramid builders found a way to intercept that invisible wireless cosmic ray that comes from the moon to make the ocean move. Enough free energy to power the entire world twice over for a day is beamed down onto the ocean every minute.What I have written about and suggested in my book is that instead of creating an ocean hydroelectric plant, we could go directly as Leedskalnin, Tesla, Dollard and the pyramid builders did, and intercept the wireless wave altogether - bypassing the need to abstract the energy from the secondary ocean movement from the wireless gravity wave of the moon, and instead absorb the primary cosmic ray energy that comes from every planet and star in the form of gravity.Indeed- this wireless gravity wave, provides the ocean with all of it's current and movement. Without the wireless invisible gravity wave between the earth and the moon. The ocean would not move to turn around the niagra falls generator plant.Tesla's greatest achievement was not the niagra falls generating plant, or even the realisation of the hydroelectric concept. Tesla's greatest achievement was bypassing the ocean current altogether, and going directly to the moon and other cosmic objects.Tesla states in his research that he has  caught cosmic rays from Antarus traveling at 50C or 50 times the speed of light devised by einstein as being the fundamental limit for all waves and mass.It stands to common sense that Einstein may not be entirely wrong, it may well be that the gravity wave which powers the ocean, and every hydroelectric plant in turn - is completely massless component.My book takes the scientist, engineer, musician into a very strange world of technical fact, and historic quotes from mechanix magazine the New York Times and the patents and work of C.P Steinmetz and Alexanderson.It shows that the electricity on planet earth, from lightning and the movement of the ocean in the trillions of watts comes solely from the cosmic rays of other stars and planets, and that the earth is like a gigantic conductor with an insulator around it called an ionosphere. Lightning being the process where the ""Solar voltage pressure"" in space exceeds the distance volume density of the insulating ionosphere of the planet, thereby causing negative electrical current to flow into the ground , usually refered to as electrons and during such a moent, an equal and opposite (gravitic) force of positive electrical current flow out of the ground in opposition, usually refered to as protons. It is infact the collision of the protons and the electrons that create the electron, which therefore whos protons and electrons are not what atoms are made of, but something that atoms can produce.This does not contradict the copenhagen theory of Quantum Physics, it rather remarkably confirms it.I really want more people to know about the electrical systems that I , Tesla and Dollard have been working with such as:

Impulse Current (TESLA)
Direct Currents (EDISON)
Alternating Currents (TESLA)
Oscillating Currents (TESLA)
The usual story is that most people have only heard of D.C and A.C, even scientists and engineers are not versed in oscillating currents and impulse currents. To do requires 4 quadrant theory and versor algebra. See Eric Dollards work for more information on this, as well as the Nikola Tesla patents to see that what I am saying is a fact. Impulse and Oscillating current are used in the Tesla MAgnifier Transmitter (Tesla Coil) not A.C and D.C. The Tesla Coil , in essence then, is a transformer, like the sun and the moon, the ocean and the planet is.Which makes it an ideal ground conjugatation with the capacitance of the earth. Indeed why Tesla used the earths ground terminal to send electricity, because he was using the transformer of the earth, and the stars, as well as the transformer of the rotary device alone, tesla was using the transformer of the rotary planet and solar system. It is likely this is in part how the Tesla Electric Car worked. Capable of 90mph, circa 1930, and traversing 1000's of miles on land before the 12V battery was changed.And this is just to get started - Help Solomon Books bring this information to people and we will use the money to make this work available to you and other people through the success of Solomon Books and the 2nd edition we will be able to print a variety of books by Eric Dollard, Adam Bull, and a MYRIAD of other authors in the subject of Technology for a New Future and 'the art'.Support this campaign if you support the resurrection of the 'the art'!""
Tesla described relativity as a 'beggar wrapped in purple whom ignorant people take for a king
.' In support of his statement he cited a number of experiments he had conducted as far back as 1896 on the cosmic ray. He has measured cosmic-ray velocities from Antarus, he said, which he found to be fifty times greater than the speed of light, thus demolishing, he contended, one of the basic pillars of relativity, according to which there can be no speed greater than that of light."" -- New York Times, 7/11/35
""People are too busy earning the lives they live than living the lives they earn - I founded this company to change that"" - Adam Bull

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! My name's Miranda Doerfler. I'm a 21 year old writer. My latest and most ambitious project is DEAD INSIDE, a zombie novella thriller that I'm incredibly excited about. Before we go any further, I want to tell you about the story:</p>
<p><strong>""A horrible virus that eats you alive from the inside out. A group of people with an amazing gift. A man who wants to unleash the virus on the world population. A newlywed whose life is in more danger than he realizes. The pieces of the puzzle must fall together in time to save humanity and prevent the zombie apocalypse.</strong></p>
<p>Dead Inside is a zombie thriller about a virus called Mortoxin which turns you into a zombie from the inside out, slowly killing you, then feeding off the cells in your body until you rot and there's nothing left. Hayter Industries has created this virus, and invited six people known as The G2 Group, to put it to use. The members of this group have an incredible ability: to make contact with the dead, materialize spirits and even revive the dead, though none of them knows how to control their power.</p>
<p>Newlywed Daniel Flynn has been summoned by Hayter Industries to be a test subject for Mortoxin, but things don't go as planned and things take a turn for the worse when an employee of Hayter Industries smuggles the virus out. Tein Luck gets his hands on Mortoxin with plans to unleash it on the public. The survival of humanity depends entirely on the ability of Hayter Industries and The G2 Group to put a stop to it before it literally eats the entire world population alive.""</p>
Basically, I am hoping to attend a massive convention in August, getting a booth there and spreading the word about my books as much as possible. I am also hoping to film a short trailer for this book, starring Seth Peterson as Daniel Flynn. This campaign is to help me get the supplies I'll need for this convention.</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In total, I'll need around $1200.</p>
<p><em>$50 - expanded distribution via CreateSpace</em><br/><em>$300 - about 100 print copies for distribution</em><br/><em>$195 - 500 bookmarks via Lulu</em><br/><em>$275 - 100 posters via Lulu</em><br/><em>$115 - 50 keychains via Vistaprint</em><br/><em>$100 - 100 buttons via CafePress</em><br/><em>$140 - IndieGoGo Fees</em></p>
<p>If I reach more than my goal, whatever funds I have will be put towards the next publication; I release a new collection of short stories every three months, so any funding will be helpful for promotions and such.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
Have you heard of <em>The Walking Dead</em>? Robert Kirkman, the creator of the incredibly popular comic book series and television show was entirely self-published. I don't know if I'll ever write something as brilliant as <em>The Walking Dead</em>, but I'm taking a shot with Dead Inside.</div>
<div>

The survival of humanity depends entirely on the ability of Hayter Industries and The G2 Group to put a stop to it before it literally eats the entire world population alive.""
Basically, I am hoping to attend a massive convention in August, getting a booth there and spreading the word about my books as much as possible. I am also hoping to film a short trailer for this book, starring Seth Peterson as Daniel Flynn. This campaign is to help me get the supplies I'll need for this convention.

What We Need & What You Get
In total, I'll need around $1200.
$50 - expanded distribution via CreateSpace$300 - about 100 print copies for distribution$195 - 500 bookmarks via Lulu$275 - 100 posters via Lulu$115 - 50 keychains via Vistaprint$100 - 100 buttons via CafePress$140 - IndieGoGo Fees
If I reach more than my goal, whatever funds I have will be put towards the next publication; I release a new collection of short stories every three months, so any funding will be helpful for promotions and such.


The Impact
Have you heard of The Walking Dead? Robert Kirkman, the creator of the incredibly popular comic book series and television show was entirely self-published. I don't know if I'll ever write something as brilliant as The Walking Dead, but I'm taking a shot with Dead Inside.

<p>Thank you for continuing to believe in America. I'd like to answer the above question with a question of my own. Do you like me? Don't respond just yet. Think about it. Do you know me? Do you like anything I've ever done, even a little bit? Most of you will probably answer ""No, sir."" to both of those questions. To you I say: fine, then snap judge me right now based on my art.

<p>What IS this thing, anyway? I haven't even told you. Well I guess I have. I'm attempting to use this site to see if it will help me get a job as a writer, if it's not clear to you yet. What kind of job? Jeez, I don't know. How does it even work? I'll be a PA or something if it helps me to be a writer's assistant eventually. I want to write for a living and also be able to pay my bills. That's not what this is by the way. DO NOT GIVE ME MONEY ON THIS SITE WITH THE INTENT THAT I WILL PAY MY BILLS WITH IT. Because I won't.

<p>If you DO donate and I make one dollar on this that would be insane and I will have successfully scammed the system. I understand that times is tough.

</h3> <p>I graduated from Savannah College of Art and Design in 2011—during the early recovery stages of the Great Recession. Though I'm incurably optimistic, I wasn't stupid enough to think that a 21-year-old with a degree in writing would be in high demand, so I packed my bags and moved to Cambodia. Not exactly the most conventional choice, but I kind of have a habit of that. </p>
<p>My memoir starts there: A solo-traveling, button-pushing, introspective young woman, heading into the unknown. <br/></p>
<p>I've written a quarter of this collection of observations, but I'm still working on the chapters about: <br/></p>
<ul>

</li>
<li>wandering into a riot in Turkey. <br/>

<p>I need about three months of uninterrupted focus to write, rewrite, doubt everything I've ever written, and edit to create a roughly 200-page memoir about my love affair with Cambodia and the ripple effect that it's had on my life. <br/></p>

</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>I started off this journey identifying myself as an American (with stereotypical pride), but now I struggle to define what that even means.</p>
<p> Drinking warm chai prepared in an Indian family's home changed me. Seeing the looks of violent unity from Turkish youth protesting the destruction of nature in the face of tear gas and rubber bullets changed me. Having a young Cambodian woman say that I've inspired her to travel and be more independent changed me. <br/></p>
<p>I've shared so many of these stories on my blog, <a href=""https://awkwardamericantraveler.wordpress.com/2015/02/11/beginning-in-india/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Awkward American Traveler</a>, to approach the magnitude of these experiences, using humor, compassion, and storytelling, but I've omitted so much. This book will finally allow me to fill in the gaps; it will allow me to tell the complete story of what becoming an adult and global citizen in this instantly connected yet chronically disconnected world is really like. </p>
<p><b>That's why if I exceed $5,000, I will donate any additional funds to <a href=""https://gri.nationbuilder.com/contribute"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">We Help Nepal</a>. </b>Their story is now our story. <br/></p>
<p>The world, to me, has become such a small place and I feel more confused and captivated by it than ever. I feel a deep responsibility to share my story—one that is interwoven with the stories of all the people I've interacted with in my life—to show that this connection, this love, is found in every corner of the earth. <br/></p>

<p>Even if you're unable to donate, please take a moment to share this campaign. I appreciate all of your help. Thank you!<br/></p>

    The Impact I started off this journey identifying myself as an American (with stereotypical pride), but now I struggle to define what that even means.
 Drinking warm chai prepared in an Indian family's home changed me. Seeing the looks of violent unity from Turkish youth protesting the destruction of nature in the face of tear gas and rubber bullets changed me. Having a young Cambodian woman say that I've inspired her to travel and be more independent changed me. 
I've shared so many of these stories on my blog, Awkward American Traveler, to approach the magnitude of these experiences, using humor, compassion, and storytelling, but I've omitted so much. This book will finally allow me to fill in the gaps; it will allow me to tell the complete story of what becoming an adult and global citizen in this instantly connected yet chronically disconnected world is really like. 
That's why if I exceed $5,000, I will donate any additional funds to We Help Nepal. Their story is now our story. 
The world, to me, has become such a small place and I feel more confused and captivated by it than ever. I feel a deep responsibility to share my story—one that is interwoven with the stories of all the people I've interacted with in my life—to show that this connection, this love, is found in every corner of the earth. 

Even if you're unable to donate, please take a moment to share this campaign. I appreciate all of your help. Thank you!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><b>The Story</b></h3>
<br/>Horrified by the ongoing, open-air nuclear bomb tests and the threat of nuclear war, the four-man crew sailed the <i>Golden Rule</i> from California toward the Marshall Islands. Their intention, publicized around the world, was to <i>nonviolently place their bodies in the way of planned nuclear bomb blasts</i>. As they sailed from Honolulu harbor for the testing area, the voyagers were stopped and arrested by the U.S. Coast Guard. Guided by their conscience, the crew attempted to sail again, were arrested once more and detained in the Honolulu city jail until the conclusion of the test cycle. <p></p>

<p>The publicity surrounding their trial and imprisonment helped ignite public outrage against nuclear weapons testing and alerted the world to the health hazards of nuclear fallout.

<p><b>My dream was to support myself without a boss and have the freedom to travel and go and do whatever I wanted. </b>I poured my heart and soul into creating location-independent businesses to give me the freedom I sought.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Over the last five years I’ve traveled and lived in over 30 countries, and done many cool things that I’d always dreamed about doing:</p>

<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>But when I started, I began at zero. I had no mentors. There were so few resources that I could consult to help me move forward. I spent hours at the library, at the park, or at the beach, speed reading through business books, in search of valuable nuggets.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Then “The Four Hour Workweek” came out and it talked about the “New Rich.” But it seemed like all these people had superpowers. Tim Ferriss himself went to Princeton. The case studies in the book seemed cherry-picked and I couldn’t replicate them. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I didn’t know how to start. How could an average person like myself live this kind of life? It seemed like an impossible fantasy.</p>

My Story






My dream was to support myself without a boss and have the freedom to travel and go and do whatever I wanted. I poured my heart and soul into creating location-independent businesses to give me the freedom I sought.


Over the last five years I’ve traveled and lived in over 30 countries, and done many cool things that I’d always dreamed about doing:


Exploring the world’s oldest rain forest
Fighting bouts as a boxer in Thailand
Exploring the Amazon on a raft
Celebrating Carnivale in Brazil
Taking up tango dancing in Buenos Aires
Island-hopping via sailboat across the South China Sea
Riding across Vietnam on a motorcycle
Living in jungle camps in Borneo
Surfed epic breaks on remote islands in the Indian Ocean
Plus a ton of other adventures.





But when I started, I began at zero. I had no mentors. There were so few resources that I could consult to help me move forward. I spent hours at the library, at the park, or at the beach, speed reading through business books, in search of valuable nuggets.


Then “The Four Hour Workweek” came out and it talked about the “New Rich.” But it seemed like all these people had superpowers. Tim Ferriss himself went to Princeton. The case studies in the book seemed cherry-picked and I couldn’t replicate them. 


I didn’t know how to start. How could an average person like myself live this kind of life? It seemed like an impossible fantasy.


Wallowing in my despair, I lacked the confidence and direction to take any meaningful action. I felt like I was mindlessly spinning the wheels, and just following some senseless routine.


More than anything I feared living the next 40-50 years of my life like this.


What I needed back then were role models. I needed a supportive community community of peers like me, helping and learning from one other. I needed valuable information that I could use - and actually implement - to take the next step.


That’s when I had my “AHA” moment - and that’s how OpenWorld Magazine was born.

<h3>Who We Are and What We Believe </h3>
<div>The F-Bomb team is an independent student group at the University of Vermont who believe a feminist publication is long overdue. The goal of this publication is to diffuse stereotypes surrounding gender equality and to raise awareness in a safe, informative, and (slightly) unbiased manner. </div>
<div>
<h3>Mission Statement</h3>The F-Bomb is committed to reinventing the conversations surrounding Feminism, femininity, gender equality, and sexual liberation. We aim to lessen the negative associations people have with these terms and create a space in which everyone can feel safe, supported, and heard. We seek to deconstruct stigmas and stereotypes whose goals are to belittle women and minimize their power, efficacy, and voice and are committed to proving magazines with female audiences can be informative, upbeat, and sexy without being inherently sexist, degrading, or demoralizing. The F-Bomb strives to foster every woman’s potential and are invested in ending the discrimination between sexes.<br/>

<div>The F-Bomb is dedicated to creating a space for female empowerment.</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We are going to have an online version of the magazine as well as a printed version. To print 1,000 copies of our mag, we will need to raise roughly $2,000. Because this monetary goal is a moving target, we added an extra $500 to give ourselves a cushion. If we do not use all $2,500 for our first print, it will go to the second addition of the magazine. If you donate, we will send you a copy! </p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Why We Need You</h3>
<div>Sexism is still an important thread that holds together the fabric of our society, and college campuses are perfect isolated examples of this. From the university's Greek life to male dominated discussions in the classroom, as students at UVM we have first hand accounts of every day sexism. It is critical to the dismantling of this sexism to have open dialogue about it and to raise awareness in a safe, supportive, and educated environment.  With the F-Bomb we hope to instill long lasting progress at our University (and hopeful other institutions) so that when our children attend UVM all genders will be treated with respect, dignity, and in a completely unbiased manner. By donating to our cause, you will become an invaluable member of the domino effect we hope to create at the University of Vermont. </div>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Time and money. We are a student group which means our education is our number one priority. Although we would love to spend all our time writing articles and perfecting pages, we also have 18 credits to worry about in addition to outside jobs. However, if we had the proper funding, this would alleviate us of the stress of applying for grants and brainstorming different fundraising events, and we could use our precious spare time to compose new articles and images. </p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help </h3> <p>Spread the word! Talk about feminism! Question the socially constructed concepts of gender identities and gender roles! Respect everyone not because they are female, male, transgender, cisgender, or anything in between but because they are a fellow human of this Earth and because we should treat everyone with the same loving-kindness we too hope to receive. </p>

<h3>Who am I and why am I doing this?</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I alluded to this all in the description and video, but let me state things very clearly. I'm a college student studying Advertising and English. I'm 22 years old. In the grand scheme of things, though my mom may disagree, I'm a very unimportant person. I'm not trying to be hard on myself, I just realize that I'm young, and have yet to really do anything in my life. In today's world, differentiating yourself and doing something above and beyond what is expected of you, is almost <i>required </i>to get a job. Since I'm a student soon to be graduating, <i style=""font-weight: bold;"">what I can do now</i> to really set myself apart and prepare myself to get a job weighs heavily on my mind. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This line of thinking goes hand-in-hand with knowing who I am and what I am capable of. Writing has always been a part of my life, and though I have never been published I consider writing to be one of my personal strengths. In fact, it is such a strength that I want to compliment my repertoire and resume by highlighting my ability to tell a story in a concise manner. This lead me to the idea of writing a children's book. Not just any children's book however, but a Star Wars children's book. By funding this project, contributors are not only helping me to get a job, but also helping me get an education and potentially helping my future children go to bed. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why Star Wars?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Along with writing, I have always been a gigantic Star Wars fan. I've written reviews of Star Wars movies and even tried my hand at creating a Star Wars blog once. It's something I know a lot about (and I'm not ashamed to admit it!). Furthermore, I think there a lot of great stories within the Star Wars universe that adults and children a like would love to hear! One of those stories is the that of IG-88, the assassin droid. That is why I chose him to be the main character of my story.</p>
<p>Since this is Star Wars, I cannot publish this book (since I have no licencing or permission from Lucas Films). If I try and make a profit from the book, I will likely be sued. That is not my intention however, my intention is to highlight a<b> fan fiction children's story</b> that I wrote myself, that I can show to recruiters and potential employers to give myself an edge in finding a job. That's my intention. I don't plan to distribute the book. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why do I need money?</h3>
<p>I can do all of the writing myself, but creating a children's book requires more than just clever writing.</p>
<ul>
<li>A picture book without pictures is worthless. Regrettably, I can only draw in stick figures. Hence, the main reason that I need funding is to pay to have someone illustrate my book. I think that I can hire someone to illustrate this book for around $500. That may not seem like much, but for a college student living from paycheck to paycheck, it isn't really feasible. </li>
<li>Physically printing the book will also cost me money, though I plan on paying for that just out of pocket. I only plan on printing <b>ONE </b>physical copy of the book for my own <b>PERSONAL </b>use. Though I would be happy to send a physical copy to anyone willing to contribute over a specific amount. </li>
<li>If I reach more than my intended goal, I will put the money towards creating a second book (which I've already begun writing) that illustrates the story of another character from Star Wars (General Greivous). </li>
<li>All contributors are welcome to receive a digital copy of the completed and illustrated children's book.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Contributing to this cause will really make a difference. No, you won't save any kids in Africa, and no you won't end world hunger... But you will make a difference in my life. Once again, I'm a nobody... but maybe with your help I can become a somebody?</p></span></span></span></div>","Who am I and why am I doing this?

<div style=""text-align: justify;"">My name is Billi Wagner. I'm a married mother of six (three of them teenagers) and an author. I have a mystery series published with a small press under a pen name because I wanted to keep my YA work separate. I only mention this because I've been through the publishing process and while I'm not an expert, I know what I need to do to make this the best book it can be. </div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">I decided to self-publish my Kindred Spirits series for a couple of reasons. The first being that my publisher only does e-books for the first year and I want this series available in print. The Young adult genre reaches all age groups, but I know a lot of teenagers who don't have e-readers. </div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">The second and most important reason is creative control. This has been a family project from the beginning. I wanted my daughter on the cover, as she inspired the main character Hallow. Most publishers have final say on everything, including cover art and would not have allowed that. I'm not saying it's a bad thing, it's just not how I wanted this series to go. </div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">Everyone is a part of the process from my daughter Scarlett doing videos in character to my son Jakob who is a computer whiz. Even the youngest ones contribute in small ways. Everyone is excited about the first book 'Haunting Echoes' because they've been a part of it every step of the way and I would love for you to be a part of it too.  In some cases, I mean that literally, you can be written into my story. There's more about that in perks. First I want to tell you what the story is about.<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; text-align: center; background-color: initial;"">        </span>

</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">16 year old Hallow Reid has had a rough year. She's lost her boyfriend, her popularity and now her freedom. After a devastating car accident, she finds herself enrolled in Koops, an institute for displaced teens, without any memory of how she got there.</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">Koops is a frightening place, full of strange happenings and secretive whispers. Hallow quickly becomes convinced both the students and the faculty are hiding something from her, but it isn't until an attempt is made on her life-correction <i>afterlife</i>-that she realizes the horrifying truth. She did NOT survive the accident.</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">Hallow may be a ghost, but to her relief she learns that she isn't <i>dead</i>. At least not yet. Her spirit is trapped in between this world and the next and if she wants to get her life back she has to pass a series of trials to prove herself worthy before her body expires. </div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">To make matters worse, a dark entity has found its way inside Koops and no one is safe-least of all Hallow, for her soul calls to him above all others and he will stop at nothing to have her. When spirits are killed in Limbo, the battle of souls becomes more than a fight for life-but for eternity.</div>
<div>           <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/659433/files/20140619000717-wwh_wwn.png?1403161637"" src="""" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; width: 499.2888888888889px; height: 41px; background-color: initial;""/>
</div>
</div><div> <p>First of all, I would never ask someone to contribute to a project I hadn't invested in myself. I didn't just write a book, but paid to have a professional cover made. It wasn't cheap, but people do judge a book by it's cover and I didn't want to take any chances by doing it myself. </p>
<p>My cover artist Claudia McKinney is a professional who works with traditional publishers like Random House and has done covers for famous authors including Amanda Hocking and Kami Garcia, one of the authors of Beautiful Creatures.  I wanted my daughter on the cover, so we hired a photographer and had the pictures sent to her so she could work her magic. </p>
<p>After Claudia finished with the artwork, it was forwarded to the Font Diva, who will also be doing the spine and back cover after editing is complete and providing me with both print and e-book sizes. All this is already paid for, but we're a one income family and it's impossible to finance this alone and still release it as soon as I would like. That's where you come in. With your help, we can make our dream a reality and bring Hallow's story to life.</p>
<p>What still needs paid for? The next step is editing. It costs around $500 for a comprehensive edit, which is everything from proof reading  to content. With my previous books I went through several edits before the final galley was ready and I really believe this is a necessary expense.  It makes the book so much better and to keep people interested in a series, it needs to be up to industry standards.</p>
<p>The rest of the money will go to formatting, paying for an ISBN number, a publishing name (so the book can get into bookstores),  the most affordable advertising I can find to get the word out (it doesn't do any good to make a book if no one knows it exists) fees and perks. Pretty much all the little things that can add up to a whole lot.</p>

<p>There are multiple levels and as you rank up you get more stuff, including everything that comes before your chosen perk. The last three levels allow you to become part of the story, either by naming or developing a character that may continue into the next book 'Tortured Souls', depending on the level you choose. The reason I can do this is that I haven't gone to edits yet. I can easily weave more characters into the story before sending it off and what a fun perk, knowing this character that readers love or love to hate is your creation or based on you or someone you know. I can't imagine a better way to be included in a creative project than contributing a part of yourself. Not just money.</p>

<p>I understand there are a lot of meaningful projects out there that you could be contributing to and perks aside, there is more to this book than an entertaining story about ghosts.  I have teenagers of my own. I've met their friends, even taken in a couple when they had nowhere else to go. I've heard and experienced some of the horrors they go through. They face very real issues today, like bullying, cutting, low-self esteem, peer pressure and more. Some even find their lives so awful they would rather die than continue suffering. The secondary plot regarding the trials is about owning their issues and realizing it's okay to be different and no matter how bad things get, they <i>can</i> survive it. I weave these messages into the plot without getting preachy, because let me tell you teenagers hate being preached at by adults. They don't confide in their parents anymore and we often don't discover something is terribly wrong until it's too late. They don't realize that we were teenagers once too and their pain is our pain. I'm hoping each teenager who reads this book can find a character they relate to with common interests or issues and see that they are not alone.  I believe that is what makes this project worthy of your time and I hope you agree.<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">                </span></p>

</div> <p>And that's all there is to it.</p></div>","My name is Billi Wagner. I'm a married mother of six (three of them teenagers) and an author. I have a mystery series published with a small press under a pen name because I wanted to keep my YA work separate. I only mention this because I've been through the publishing process and while I'm not an expert, I know what I need to do to make this the best book it can be. 
I decided to self-publish my Kindred Spirits series for a couple of reasons. The first being that my publisher only does e-books for the first year and I want this series available in print. The Young adult genre reaches all age groups, but I know a lot of teenagers who don't have e-readers. 
The second and most important reason is creative control. This has been a family project from the beginning. I wanted my daughter on the cover, as she inspired the main character Hallow. Most publishers have final say on everything, including cover art and would not have allowed that. I'm not saying it's a bad thing, it's just not how I wanted this series to go. 
Everyone is a part of the process from my daughter Scarlett doing videos in character to my son Jakob who is a computer whiz. Even the youngest ones contribute in small ways. Everyone is excited about the first book 'Haunting Echoes' because they've been a part of it every step of the way and I would love for you to be a part of it too.  In some cases, I mean that literally, you can be written into my story. There's more about that in perks. First I want to tell you what the story is about.        

                                 

16 year old Hallow Reid has had a rough year. She's lost her boyfriend, her popularity and now her freedom. After a devastating car accident, she finds herself enrolled in Koops, an institute for displaced teens, without any memory of how she got there.
Koops is a frightening place, full of strange happenings and secretive whispers. Hallow quickly becomes convinced both the students and the faculty are hiding something from her, but it isn't until an attempt is made on her life-correction afterlife-that she realizes the horrifying truth. She did NOT survive the accident.
Hallow may be a ghost, but to her relief she learns that she isn't dead. At least not yet. Her spirit is trapped in between this world and the next and if she wants to get her life back she has to pass a series of trials to prove herself worthy before her body expires. 
To make matters worse, a dark entity has found its way inside Koops and no one is safe-least of all Hallow, for her soul calls to him above all others and he will stop at nothing to have her. When spirits are killed in Limbo, the battle of souls becomes more than a fight for life-but for eternity.
           

 First of all, I would never ask someone to contribute to a project I hadn't invested in myself. I didn't just write a book, but paid to have a professional cover made. It wasn't cheap, but people do judge a book by it's cover and I didn't want to take any chances by doing it myself. 
My cover artist Claudia McKinney is a professional who works with traditional publishers like Random House and has done covers for famous authors including Amanda Hocking and Kami Garcia, one of the authors of Beautiful Creatures.  I wanted my daughter on the cover, so we hired a photographer and had the pictures sent to her so she could work her magic. 
After Claudia finished with the artwork, it was forwarded to the Font Diva, who will also be doing the spine and back cover after editing is complete and providing me with both print and e-book sizes. All this is already paid for, but we're a one income family and it's impossible to finance this alone and still release it as soon as I would like. That's where you come in. With your help, we can make our dream a reality and bring Hallow's story to life.
What still needs paid for? The next step is editing. It costs around $500 for a comprehensive edit, which is everything from proof reading  to content. With my previous books I went through several edits before the final galley was ready and I really believe this is a necessary expense.  It makes the book so much better and to keep people interested in a series, it needs to be up to industry standards.
The rest of the money will go to formatting, paying for an ISBN number, a publishing name (so the book can get into bookstores),  the most affordable advertising I can find to get the word out (it doesn't do any good to make a book if no one knows it exists) fees and perks. Pretty much all the little things that can add up to a whole lot.
I'd love to do a print run, if there's any money left, but there's always print on demand with Create space and I tried to keep my goal as reasonable as possible, without sacrificing quality.  I chose flex funding, so if we don't make the goal (fingers crossed that we do) we can get started, while I save up toward the rest. This project will  happen. There's no risk in investing because I already have and I'm not going to quit on something I've put so much money into myself, not to mention time and energy. The only difference between meeting our goal and not is time. 
If we get the full amount of the funding I hope to have the book released this October. What better time to launch a ghost story right? If we don't make our goal it will take longer-how much depends on how close we get. I'll update everyone when we get near our end date for the campaign. All perks will be delivered no matter what if you contribute to this project and we have some pretty cool perks or as my daughter would say 'Epic'.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>A beautiful brick building with stained glass and hardwood pews, remains empty after 3 years. You can help save it!</p>
<p>My name is Jordan Gardner. I am an assistant pastor of Solid Rock Community Church in Harvard, IL. This campaign is purposed to raise funds towards the downpayment for financing this beautiful building for our congregation to meet. Currently, we are filling a storefront to its maximum capacity and have become in dire need of a larger location. Three years ago, we rented this building and due to the high rent and gas expences due to a very low efficiency gas-heated boiler, we moved to our current location. After being foreclosed on, the price has continually decreased to a point now that it would be a wise decision to purchase. We need your help!</p>
<p>With a full-service kitchen that meets food safety requirements, we will be able to offer a low to no-income soup kitchen for Harvard and its surrounding area. With the classrooms, it will once again be possible to conduct Sunday School for our youth and with the open fellowship hall, we will be able to expand our youth service that reaches out local children and teens.</p>
<p>This purchase would mean so much to our church congregation and community. If you are able to contribute please donate now, otherwise please share with others. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here is the breakdown of where the money is going:</p>
<ul>
<li>$15,000 is going directly to American Community Bank of Woodstock, IL for downpayment.</li>
<li>$10,000 will be paid to an HVAC operator to install a higher efficiency heating and cooling system. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the perks to those who give:</p>
<ol>
<li>$100- you will receive a thank you letter signed by the whole congregation.</li>
<li>$150- you will receive the thank you letter and a SRCC t-shirt.</li>
<li>$500- you will receive the thank you letter, the t-shirt, and will sit at the dedication service as a guest of honor (hotel room included)</li>
<li>$1,000- you will receive the thank you letter, the t-shirt, the guest of honor, and a plaque with your name on it hung on a wall in the sanctuary.</li>

<p><i><span>Life sucks! Life's a bitch! Life’s
unfair!</span></i></p>
<p><span>Are
you familiar with these words? They express the frustrations of millions who
have encountered “failure” and feel like nothing seems to work. This book is
for you if you have felt or feel that way. You start a business and your hopes
rise, but then some unseen force comes knocking everything off and you are
zeroed, broke as they say, without knowing why. You get a new job, an increase
in salary, and you raise a glass of wine toasting your success with friends. You
think that everything has fallen <span>into place,
but you soon discover that your debt is tripled and that your misery only
increases. </span></span></p>
<p>Then you
start asking the million dollar questions: <i><span>What is really the problem with life? </span></i><i>Why can’t I get what I really want in life? Why
is my dream job given to someone who doesn’t seem to like it or who can’t do it
well? Why can’t my business attract as many clients as my competitor’s? Why
can’t I be successful in my relationships, in my career, in getting rich …and
why does the famous <b>Secret </b>seem to
work for everyone but me? </i></p>
<p><span>At
this point you want to believe that something is seriously wrong with life.
You’re wrong again. There is nothing wrong with life. If there is anything
wrong, it is the way you look at life, the way you treat it, and the way you
receive it. Uncle Sam </span>always said the damn world doesn't <span>care shit about who you are or how much you claim
to know. It really only cares about the tough ones out there, and you’re going to have to be tough enough to create your
own space.  </span></p>
<p><span>The
most successful people of all time have experienced that emotion when they <span>were first met with failure, and they made the choice
or choices that changed their lives in incredible ways. Life continues to knock
down people who still dream with their eyes closed. Failure comes in to wake
you to live the beauty of your dreams. “It's time you start your journey,” it
seems to say. That is what this book is all about: discovering the seed of
success and making it grow to its potential in your life. </span></span>It’s about
dreams and the key to unlocking those dreams. </p>
<p>You can’t
live without your dream, but you have the choice to shy away from it or to
allow it to transform you and the world around you. Whether you are aware of
your dream or not, your life will remain barren unless you discover the one
thing for which you’re ready to sacrifice it. If you have lost faith in your
dream and yourself, you need to read this book. You need to reconnect with your
dream, because if you don’t, your life will be a big lie. It’s never with pride
you hear people say: “I should have been a great musician, a reputable lawyer,
a renowned motivational speaker, a successful writer, an inventor of the next big
thing if…” They have always said such things with regret at not pursuing their
dream, feeling like they stole a space in the universe that wasn’t really
theirs, barely squeezing themselves in.<span>  </span></p>
<p>If you do not
pursue your dream for yourself, you should do it for others. When you
resolutely go after your dreams, you create a path through which others can
walk in life. It’s the debt you owe to life and humanity - the debt to grow to
the full stature of your dreams. Your dream has the tremendous power to
transform your life, and in so doing, it creates a path through which more life
flows into the world. </p>
<p>You might
have read other books, watched inspirational and motivational videos, attended
seminars, and explored every avenue of creating wealth and living meaningfully.
After trying all the tips and putting the motivational pieces of advice into
practice, you might still feel like that dream wasn’t meant for you. You might
have blamed it on chance, on the cruel world that continually conspires against
you, or the capitalist system that continues to suck the blood from the poor to
feed the already rich and successful people. You might have thought you aren’t
getting it right when you see people who seem to be less talented than you
achieving success and making money as though they were born with the Midas
touch. At some point, you begin to despair and you think: “It wasn’t really
meant for me. I should have known all along that I am destined for failure.”</p>
<p>You’re
awfully wrong. </p>
<p>You couldn’t
be more wrong than that.</p>
<p>You are
sculpted for success, and there is no dream that isn’t possible. You can only
dream what life offers you. All you have to do is reach out and accept that
dream. </p>
<p>Your only
obstacle to making the next big success story is <i>you</i>. It’s the way you think. </p>
<p>Thought is
powerful. Thought is what transforms the world. If you doubt it, think about
the wonderful inventions that now make people travel faster than it could have
been possible some few decades ago; think about the digital devices, the
infrastructure, and the skyscrapers that tower right up into the sky as though
telling you with a forefinger, “This is the amazing thing about what your
thoughts can achieve.” </p>
<p>Your thoughts
are things. The bigger those thoughts, the more incredible the things they
create. </p>
<p>This book
doesn’t offer you what you do not have. It will only offer you tips on how to
become the master of what you possess and how to make it grow. You already have
the key to success, the secret that rich and successful people have discovered.
It’s the power of your mind. In part one of this book, we will explore thought
patterns that can hinder you from mastering the secret and how they define you.
In part two, you’ll learn how to eliminate these thought patterns and attain
inner freedom. The last part offers insights on how to empower yourself,
re-claim your dream and make it become a reality. Before you continue reading
this book, I would like to mention that you may find the style a bit hurting
because of the overgeneralizations. I have consciously used this style in a
manner of speaking. </p><b>What Others Say About This Book<br/><br/></b>""""If you have lost faith in your dream and yourself, you need to read this book...

</p><p>For years I worked with my life coaching clients and
workshop participants to teach them how to manifest the life of their dreams. I
dreamed of running a retreat center focused on creativity, personal development, spirituality and
physical well-being. Then in an instant of astounding clarity my vision
changed. <br/></p><p>I realized that I was meant to contribute to the creation of new community in the world. So I started my own community and one of the first projects to launch from this effort is a book on how to create cohesive intentional communities called <i>Collective Manifestation: Heart-Centered Blueprints for Creating Intentional Community</i>. Communities are being created in social media and through blogs, in chat rooms and through online programs, in virtual games, via non-profit events, and at physical locations around the globe. <br/></p>
<p><b>I don't believe we are here to be super-consumers; we are here to be powerful creators! <br/></b></p><p>We are here to create the new processes, structures and solutions that will move us into a
bright, inventive and exciting future. What I've experienced is that we best expand our talents, gifts and life work by playing within groups or communities that support and inspire us. I think of it like this: one person doing something remarkable generates the ripple effect of small sail boat. Ten people coming together with intention generates the force of a ship. A thousand people generate an immense tidal wave of energy that affects the collective positively. <br/></p><p>The potential in each of us that hasn't even begun to be tapped yet. If you are like me, you feel feel like you've been acting alone for too long and want to experience the power of connecting your brilliance to something really dynamic. <br/></p><p><b>You may be ready to lead or belong to a community if you:<br/></b></p><ul>
<li>Long to connect to others in a more meaningful way around spirituality.<br/>
</li>
<li>Love to cook, paint, or chant (you name it) and you've wondered what your options are for bringing others together to expand this talent. <br/>
</li>
<li>Want to help make a difference through specific ecological lifestyle choices but don't want to go it alone in starting an initiative or project.</li>
<li>Are feeling the political activist in you emerging and know it's time to join with others around your passion.</li>
<li>Keep thinking something needs to be done about creating a more equitable economy and you'd love to lead innovation in this area.</li>
<li>Believe that communities of artists can change the world for the better.<br/>
</li>
<li>Envision what a healing group could accomplish.</li>
<li>Have wanted to start a group around parenting kids with ADHD or learning disabilities and don't know where to start.<br/>
</li>
<li>Want to start an animal sanctuary but it feels like too much for one person.<br/>
</li>
<li>Believe that travel is the ideal way to a happier planet!<br/>
</li>
</ul><p>Truly, heart-centered community creation will reshape the world as we know it. I keep connecting
to people who long to live values of wholeness and connection, healing and
creative passion, sustainability and respect for all living beings. This a
great time to reinvent what community is and how it operates.</p>

Includes  identifying core values and member needs, learning how to use clear intention to create favorable outcomes, and how to facilitate each person being heard and choosing the role they play within community.<br/>

to people who long to live values of wholeness and connection, healing and
creative passion, sustainability and respect for all living beings. This a
great time to reinvent what community is and how it operates.
So, I have taken everything I know
about the law of attraction and manifestation and stepped it up! What this book is about:Collective
Manifestation is about what is
possible when you let go of societal limits associated with gender, age and
roles and become conscious of what wants to show up through your authentic brilliance. This book includes:Practical exercises for creating a cohesive and effective community. Includes  identifying core values and member needs, learning how to use clear intention to create favorable outcomes, and how to facilitate each person being heard and choosing the role they play within community.

Discussion around how to address the particular issues of our time like, ""How do we work in permission with nature instead of dominating it?"" and ""What ""currency"" systems can we create for healthier systems of exchange?
Stories about the fascinating and experimental things people are doing in their own areas of passion.Creative energy processes that enable groups to access their collective intuitive genius.Collective
Manifestation comes from my vision of joyfully engaged
individuals stepping into their unlimited potential each day creating, innovating
and being of service. One group and one community at a time we can create a true global community as we connect authentically to each other,
our heart intentions, and our living Earth. I hope you will be part of my community effort to get this book out into the world.What's NeededI need a community of funding angels
to help me raise $5000 to get this book published. I'm
putting this request out into a world I believe in. It's a humbling and hopeful
ask. It's a scary and exhilarating possibility. If the message of this book resonates, I hope you'll respond with your heartfelt participation. It all matters greatly. The book has been written and luckily, I have the
marketing savvy to launch the book. I need to manifest your help
so that I can reach the people who will be inspired by this message, and
 who
will then use the book guidelines to create their own unique community that leads our world into more joy, freedom, peace and plenty for all.Funds will go toward:

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello Everyone! I'm Mallory and I live in the very sunny state, Florida. I'm 14 and for as long as I can remember, I have always loved to write! Now, just recently, I have written a self help book manuscript exclusively for girls. But now, I hope that I can turn my manuscript into a book in print. With your contribution, I will be able to self publish my script into a book through a very reliable self book publishing company called AuthorHouse. Want to know more about my book? Well, I'll give you some information: My self help book manuscript is fully packed with advice on all sorts of different topics. How to deal with drama. How to deal with bullies, and how to deal with fitting in with different situations and people. And that is not just it. There are so many more topics that I have included in my book. I am hoping to reach readers from all over the country and maybe even further!     </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>There are many different packages of self publishing to choose from Author House. But my main goal for publishing is $1,000 or maybe more. With a simple donation of $5, I will give you updates to keep you in the loop about my book. If and when my book is published, I will give you details on how to order it. You will basically get to be the first to know about the progression of my self help book. Also, if I decide to have a radio station, I will consider you to be a guest speaker and more. If I can, I will try to give my contributors a signed copy of my book, too.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I really appreciate all donations. The impact will be very great not only for my efforts but for girls of all ages. Teen and tween girls will finally be able to rely on great advice. There are many things that girls are going through today. Sibling rivalry. Bad break ups, bad fights with parents, and just plain,  bad stress. Jealousy. Some girls are teased. Some girls may be feeling shy. The reason I even wrote this book was because I know I was having some stress, too. So, I helped myself by writing! There is a lot of power in words, but you can keep someones writing forever! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help:</p>
<p>Spread the word about my campaign! Tell everyone you know! I want to change a girl's life! Spread the word through the wide world of social media! </p>

<p>Crack the Spine Literary Magazine was founded and is nurtured by the loving hands of people obsessed with the written word. We steal out of bed to snuggle with illicit poetry while our loved ones are sleeping. We skip happy hour to guzzle gallons of short stories instead. Flash fiction regularly punches us square in our collective face and we smile through broken teeth, already hungry for more.</p>
<p>Since 2011, we have published hundreds of authors' poetry and prose in our digital magazine. We've also published and distributed five stunning (if we do say so, ourselves) print anthologies. We’ve discovered some new, raw talent and placed their work alongside that of seasoned professionals. We are inspired and humbled by the level of interest in our publications.</p>
<p>But now we need your help to keep going!</p>
<ul>
<li>If you look forward to our weekly digital magazine…</li>
<li>If you have been inspired by one of our stories or touched by a poem…</li>
<li>If you’ve found kinship and valuable conversation with other readers…</li>

<p>The phrase “labor of love” takes on a new meaning at Crack the Spine, as no one involved in the production of digital or print publications is receiving financial compensation! We’re investing massive amounts of our time and energy to contribute to the literary community as a whole and we hope we can count on our loyal readers to help us out as we move forward.</p>
<p>Our financial goal is simple… a thousand bucks. This will allow us to cover operating expenses (website hosting, anthology printing, digital and print issue promotions, etc) and continue producing a quality product that we hope brings value to our contributors and readers.</p>
<p>Our artistic goal is more complicated… we plan to never stop looking for new ways to grow, expand and spread the word about the talented writers and artists who are kind enough to share their work with us.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Timothy Bowden, indie author, history fanatic and zombie geek. My second novel - Freaks and Greeks - is ready to be distributed, but it needs your help! As an independent author, I don't have the resources of a huge publishing house behind me, so I need some cash to build a website and order a print-run of my book to put in book stores and sell to the public. The book is ready to go (edited, designed, printed), it's just waiting to head out into the wide world. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $3000 AUD to order a large print-run for a bunch of copies of the book, as well as to build a website to be able to connect with cool people like you. Your contribution will:</p>
<p>* enable me to order a large print-run of the book. Once the campaign is over, there will be no production or wait time. If your pledge includes a copy of the book, you will receive yours in excellent time.</p>
<p>* build a kick-arse website to connect with zombie/history enthusiasts around the world. A website will enable me to sell copies of my book as well as communicate with indie book fans. Yay!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution would mean a lot to me. It would help support an independent author, and an independent publishing house.</p>
<p>Your support will not only help me order copies of my book, but it will support a grass-roots publishing enterprise as it makes it's mark against the book conglomerates. In this age of e-books, there is something magical about holding an actual printed book in your hand. Call me old-fashioned, but nothing excites me more than plucking a book off a shelf in a little neighbourhood book shop and leafing through it's wondrous pages.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Seriously, there are no risks or challenges. With the funds I raise, I will order as many copies of the book as I possibly can. You will get yours (if you pledge for one) and I can build my website! Once the books are shipped, the only potential challenge is out of my hands (and in the hands of the postal service!).  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Don't have any spare cash (I know how you feel)? That's ok! You could give this campaign a huge push by:</p>
<ul>
<li>spreading the word about this campaign and the novel Freaks and Greeks</li>
<li>sharing the campaign on social media (Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Snapchat).</li>
</ul>
<p>To our international friends, we're so sorry we can't ship signed or personalised copies of the book overseas for the purposes of this campaign, BUT you have the option of ordering an unsigned copy or an eBook now. Once the campaign has concluded, the book will be available on Amazon and other fantastic sites offering international postage. Yay! </p>

My love of story telling started when I was introduced to anime and it's many forms, before my tastes quickly matured or rather expanded into books.  I have always been a fan of the science fiction genre of dystopian themes that can arise from said future.

<p><strong>The Sequence Begins:</strong></p>
<p>With Honour Bound by Blood - jump into a web of death, betrayal, and deceit. A high fantasy, dystopian, epic tale that tackles the question <b>is it all black and white, good or bad or is there a grey area in all this? </b>  </p>
<p><strong>What is Vertigo?</strong> </p>
<p>Without giving away too many <strong>spoilers </strong>Vertigo is a story that explores power and the human condition as it relates to drive and moral.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I wrote book 1 in the sequence with two goals really:</p>
<p>1. To bring a plethora of characters to the reader that they can relate to in some way shape or form.</p>
<p>2. To make it as epic as possible in scale and in story. I wanted people to get lost in this this word to picture it vividly to imagine it as I have or interpret it as they wish.</p>
<p>I feel as though I have been working on this project for a long time, and I feel as though not many indie authors get the opportunity to traditionally published. I embarked on this route because I wanted to show people that you can retain ownership of your work and be ethically artistic to yourself and your body of work. Without having to cut corners or sacrifice your dream to fit the proverbial box to sell copies or to make it marketable to the main stream. I wanted to build a community of people who love to get lost in fantasy, who enjoy an epic read.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Some risks and challenges are that people may not like the book, Or you may hate the characters you may feel the pacing is trash or you may find some other problematic issues in it.

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<i>Get With The Program</i> discusses why computer science education opportunities need to be available in every school and the difficulties that come about when trying to get these classes into the classroom.<br/><br/>My name is Mary and I am the author of <i>Get With The Program</i>. I wrote this book because schools across the nation are in a dire need for computer science education opportunities from qualified teachers.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the importance and the power of providing computer science education at all stages of learning. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for computer science education in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you integrate more computer science opportunities within your community.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about diversity in the technology space and it's relation with education and the struggle of attaining teachers for computer science:<ul>
<li>The technology field severely lacks diversity which means that implicit biases are being coded into technologies we use every day.</li>
<li>Teachers looking to teach advanced computer science courses must pass a licensing exam which has been compared to taking 3-4 college computer science courses, making it difficult for teachers to earn.</li>
<li>Computer science education relies heavily on funding, meaning that computer science education opportunities are primarily in wealthy areas that can afford licensed teachers and the computers needed for the course, thus continuing the lack of diversity in the technology field.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you have any interest in technology, education, or both.<br/><br/><i>Get With The Program</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to education professionals and parents who are looking at computer science opportunities in their own schools and communities for the first time.</p>
<h3>The Book - Get With The Program</h3> The book is written in 4 Parts....<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters 1-3. Part 1 dives into the issues behind computer science education and what makes this subject so difficult to bring into the classroom. In these chapters I will talk about accessibility to computer science education and how it correlates with educational equity and the achievement gap. Furthermore, we will go over what a technology course is about and how it is currently being misunderstood.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains Chapters 4 - 6. In this part, we will discuss the role of teachers in the technology space. Teaching computer science is not an easy feat, especially when the subject matter changes every 5 - 10 years considering the speed modern technology is changing. This part focuses on bringing teachers into the computer science space to give our students the best computer science experience.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains Chapters 7 - 9. These chapters will talk specifically on how to implement computer science education into schools. Whether that be introducing a new course or integrating computer science skills into a math lesson, computer science education can (and should) fit into the daily curriculum of all students.<br/><br/>Part 4 contains Chapters 10 - 11. The final chapters in the book will be my suggestions on possible solutions to bringing about more computer science opportunities and making it more accessible for all communities. Additionally, I will talk about the power of technology and where I see the field going.<br/> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<ul>
<li>The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in April 2020</li>
<li>The Cover Design of my Book - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder!</li>
<li>The Layout Design for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Audiobook)</li>
<li>The Copyediting for My Book - to help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication</li>
<li>The Launch &amp; Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this spring</li>
</ul>
<br/>When I pre-sell 100 copies of my book, I will publish. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish an audiobook. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will donate the additional profits to fund scholarships for teacher workshops in support of expanding computer science education.<br/><br/>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:<ul>

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Mary Newby is an IT Design Analyst for Harley-Davidson, as well as the President of her Alma Mater’s Young Alumni Association and a teacher’s assistant for a Introduction to Computer Science class at a local high school.<br/><br/>Mary has been volunteering for local schools as a teacher’s assistant for computer science classes for two years now. Without the help of herself and volunteers like her, many schools in her area would not have a computer science program. She loves her technology career and wants more young people exposed to the opportunities, growth, and creativity that accompany a job in the field. Unfortunately, many schools do not have a comprehensive computer science program, leaving many students without the chance to explore the subject. Mary is looking for answers as to why computer science education opportunities are so scarce when technology is everywhere!<br/><br/>In her very little free time, Mary spends most of it at home with her cats (cat lady alert!), either reading, cooking, or crafting. She is the fourth of five girls in her family who all reside in the Midwest and is the proud aunt of 6 nieces and nephews, who she hopes will positively benefit from the work she is doing promoting computer science education.<br/><br/>For more information you can connect with Mary at marycnewby@gmail.com and on LinkedIn.</p>

<p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.</p>
