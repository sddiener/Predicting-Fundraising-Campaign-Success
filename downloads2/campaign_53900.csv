<h3>THE NEW TREATS</h3>
<p>Our new product line focuses on three different proteins: locally sourced Canadian beef, locally sourced Canadian pork, and sustainably sourced Alaskan cod. They come in two different cuts: mightys, a thin wafer, and minis, the smallest air-dried treat on the market.</p>

<h3>YOUR DOG IS OVERWEIGHT - THE CANINE OBESITY EPIDEMIC </h3>
<p>Ok. Maybe not your dog, but about half of dogs <i>are</i> overweight.  <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We even see many pet parents who feed their dogs great species-appropriate diets but then spoil them with high carb biscuits and dollar store junk. </span><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Just like us humans, our canine companions are prone to additional health risks caused by being overweight. Some of these health issues include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Increased likelihood of arthritis and other joint injuries such as torn ligaments.</li>
<li>Heart and breathing conditions such as collapsed trachea and laryngeal paralysis which can be fatal if untreated.</li>
<li>Greater risk of complications during anaesthesia due to overworked heart and respiratory systems.</li>
<li>Tumors and cancer linked to obesity, specifically benign fatty cell tumors and transitional cell carcinoma</li>
<li>Skin irritation and infection </li>
<li>Lower quality of life due to it being harder to get up and down and play</li>
<li><strong>Up to two years off the lifespan of your dog</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We want to help your dog live a happy, healthy life, and believe that starts with proper nutrition.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>WHY INDIEGOGO?</h3>
<p>We've decided to do this crowdfund as an event to celebrate the next phase of our company and help us gauge interest and demand in our new products as we finalize our production run. We're also a self-funded company which means we've never taken on any private equity from investors that will take control of our company.</p>
<h3>OUR STORY</h3>
<p>We started making treats for our dogs in 2014 when we weren't happy with the quality of treats available. Many ""natural"" treats were more gimmicky than natural, and the majority were made with questionable ingredients or from even more questionable sources.</p>
<p>After seeing many pet parents with similar issues all over Canada and the USA, we decided to start selling our own treats online as a way to give back to some of the rescues we had been following.</p>
<p>In 2015, co-founders Lucas Walker and Riley Wallbank decided to focus on Treats Happen full time. Every weekend, Riley and Lucas attended consumer shows selling their treats and meeting customers.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, and we're going all-in on single-ingredient treats, and giving back is still at the core of what we do.</p>

<h3>RISKS AND CHALLENGES </h3>
<p>There are always risks, especially with the food industry. Some steps we've taken to help prevent any risks are</p>
<ul>
<li>Ordered in packaging and have it on hand</li>

<li>Have full traceability of all ingredients</li>
<li>Looking into alternative shipping methods with the rolling Canada Post strikes</li>

This juicy red fruit doesn't taste like coffee and instead provides a berry-like flavour. The cherry is picked, washed, sorted, and de-pulped in order to retrieve the small seeds it encompasses.The seeds will eventually make their way down the coffee chain ending up in your home country either roasted or as green beans and eventually brewed.  Meanwhile at origin, when not upcycled the remaining pulp and skin of this antioxidant-rich, superfruit cherry, is thrown into a pile of other cherries, breaking down harmful toxins into the surrounding environment. Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages in the world. An estimated 3 billion cups of coffee are consumed every day!This massive demand results in approximately 20 billion kilos of coffee fruit waste created, each year! Everybody losesThis further represents a loss of productive land for farmers and a missed economic opportunity to utilise this resource. Furthermore, the coffee fruit's superfruit properties are being deprived in a world where people are under-fed, malnourished or living incredibly stressful lives. With a huge food waste issue across the world, we must look towards innovation in food systems and alternative methods to bring to light byproducts. Our solution to this waste problem is to divert and upcycle the superfruit from a value-ending cycle, turning the coffee fruit extract into delicious Coffee Fruit Bars!We’re on a mission to create systemic change in coffee by adding value to the fruit.Our goal: To bring Coffee Fruit Bars to your pantry, local cafe, office or health food store.We aim to upgrade our packaging from craft to home-compostable and are partnering with an ethical manufacturer to produce our bars.This is your chance to be a part of changing the future, where food can be diverted from waste and turned into impact.  Over the last year of testing, we collected the feedback and finessed our product design and recipes to bring to you the following upgrade to our bars. 1 year of recipe testing has landed us with...Ingredients: Organic Dates, Coffee Fruit Extract, Organic Cashews, Almond Meal, Organic Tahini, Pesticide Free Almonds, Roasted Almond Butter, Organic Cocoa, Organic Ground Colombian Coffee. Organic Tahini mixed with high-quality ground Colombian coffee…yes please! A perfect match for those seeking a flavour-packed, energy boost at any time of day. THE PICK ME UP has good fats from the quality Tahini, combined with antioxidant-rich ground coffee and coffee fruit will provide a hunger-busting energy kick.*Fan tip: A must-have for long exercise…or even long work meeting! Ingredients: Almond Meal, Pesticide Free Almonds, Coffee Fruit Extract, Organic Dates, Organic Cashews, Organic Tapioca Flour, Organic Coconut, Lemon Oil. Zesty lemon and coconut sound like a morning treat to you?

Here are a few of the comments they made.  Please take a few seconds to click these links and share Coffee Fruit Bar with your friends - it really could make all the difference in bringing our project to life!   Food waste is a problem that makes news headlines every day, however, it is typically only showcased at the consumer end. This prompted us to ask:What could we create to make an impact through food?It wasn't until we looked right under our noses to see that our history and contacts in the coffee industry were the perfect catalysts for tackling a real issue we're very passionate about...coffee fruit waste. Why? Because coffee fruit is one of nature's untapped superfruits. It's low in caffeine, high in antioxidants, contains essential plant micro-nutrients and tastes delicious!That's why we founded I Am Grounded, a business solely aimed at rethinking the value of coffee fruit.Our first product the Coffee Fruit Bar, uses what would otherwise be discarded superfruit in an effort to bring to market a product that does good, taste good and create's impact. In January 2019, we invited feedback from over 50 coffee farmers and coffee scientists to make sure that the flavour and consistency were right. We're so thankful to have the opportunity to showcase a commercially viable product from the natural by-product of the coffee fruit.Risks and challengesAfter making more than 10,000 bars over the past year and upcycling almost one ton of coffee fruit waste in the process, we have de-risked this Indiegogo as much as possible. Our bars have progressed through many stages to reach our current MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and we are very excited to deliver our first proper launch. We have our manufacturing, design and compostable wrapping lined up and ready to package our new bars!As with all food products that have unique ingredients, there is a small chance of supply issues. However, rest assured we have very reliable sources and partners to deliver as required. Likewise, there is a small chance our production partners become inundated with orders at the time we will be looking to fulfil. However, we have discussed this with them and agreed this is unlikely. We are confident in meeting the planned project timeline.We have strong momentum and a roadmap for growth, but we need your help. Without the crucial backing from you, the Indiegogo community, we simply do not have the means to grow this business. We urge you, Indiegogo , to support our vision and come with us on this journey. Make the choice now to have an everyday impact, on a global issue!Thank you!Lachlan, Vanessa and the I Am Grounded team. **Update COVID-19** With the unforeseen massive global impact of COVID-19, we are not currently anticipating any delay with backer fulfilment. However, this is an evolving situation that we will keep backers updated on, should any direct impacts occur to our timeline.",78.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Who is The Revolution?</h3>
<p>We are Bill and Leslee Workman and we founded The Revolution Ice Cream Company out of a passion for two things: ice cream and having a positive impact in our world. First and foremost we have a belief in serving others by any means necessary. We have always been deeply involved in our church(Relevant Church in Ybor City, FL) Shameless plug, I know.</p>
<p>And then of course we also love food. We travel sometimes just with the purpose of trying specific restaurants. I also grew up with a mom who is a dietician so the science of food has always been fascinating. And here we arrive at ice cream. Along with our 4 kids, this sweet frozen treat has consumed our lives, AND WE LOVE IT! If I am the Willy Wonka of ice cream then Leslee is my Umpa Lumpa. I love to make ice cream that challenges your ideas of what ice cream should be. Some of my most popular flavors include: Chocolate Habañero, Vanilla Bean with Curried Toasted Coconut, Sweet Potato with Toasted Marshmallows, Pecans and Caramel, Pumpkin Goat Cheese and Lavender with Honeyed Pine Nuts just to name a few.</p>

<div><p><strong>Sonic Dutch Cold Brew Coffee Review by a Barista</strong></p></div>

<p>Cold brew has become a popular choice by coffee lovers over recent years for a few reasons. It has a lower acidity to regularly brewed coffee and fans of it report a less bitter taste, the flavors often being sweet with a smoother texture.</p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1591302330/qyz8qsaij8ycsvn7gclz.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<p> The big drawback of cold brew is making it. To achieve the unique result of cold brew the coffee beans are steeped for more than 10 hours in cold water.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“<strong>More than 10 ten hours?</strong> But if I leave it overnight I’ll have fresh cold brew in the morning, right?”</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1591302379/znzu6qavpd16gf3sz7es.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Not only is making it at home a lot of time and effort, but the amount of coffee you get is so small that it hardly seems worth bothering. It certainly won’t satisfy your morning craving.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong> “But I’m hooked on cold brew! There has to be an easier way to make it at home!”</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1591302423/fhey8xszcfwp2vugscwg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>“I’ve always beensensitive to caffeine, but don’t want to drink decaf alone. I wish there was a way to <strong>enjoy reduced caffeine drinks at home</strong>.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p> As coffee lovers and professional baristas, we searched far and wide for a cold-brew coffee solution that would address all these problems. We couldn’t find anything.</p>

<p>Sonic Dutch is an innovation in cold-brewing coffee technology, <strong>making cold brew coffee in only 5 minutes</strong>, by utilizing the advanced sonic wave engineering.</p>
<p>This not only saves you precious time when you are on the go, but also solves your typical “hygienic issues” involved in the conventional cold brewing making process. Because of long hours waiting for cold brew to be ready, there can be exposure to contamination such as E. coli and other germs.</p>
<p>As well, you get to control the richness of the flavor by customizing the intensity and frequency control of the sonic wave.</p>
<p>In other words - a tech-loving coffee-drinker’s dream.</p>

<p><strong>TRIED &amp; TESTED RESULTS!</strong></p>
<p>Sonic Dutch can produce cold brew in as little as five minutes. And we can prove it!</p>

<p>We undertook an experiment to measure the density of cold brew coffee produced by traditional cold brew extraction methods and Sonic Dutch. Using 100g of coffee with 500ml of water with the Sonic Dutch we tried the 5, 10, and 15 minute settings respectively. <strong>Results showed cold brewing for 5 minutes by Sonic Dutch is as dense as the results brewed for 10 hours by the regular methods</strong>.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1591305446/wn8zfymztber3wj4s6sh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The baristas who tasted our cold brew said the coffee brewed for 5-10 minutes by Sonic Dutch had the best taste. <strong>More than 90% of our taste testers said our cold brew coffee tasted softer and smoother than using the usual extraction methods</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1591305480/jeqfneynyp3crodwddrc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>What these taste tests prove is that the cold brew coffee Sonic Dutch extracts is the pure essence of the coffee, so therefore it has much lower caffeine levels than regular cold brew and the taste is much sweeter. None of that bitterness associated with regular coffee. We know our cold brew is the new, leading way to extract your cold brew.</p>

<p>I wholly believe that because <strong>coffee contains the heart of the person who extracts it, the taste of all coffee is dependent on who extracts it</strong>.</p>
<p>So, if you extract coffee with negative thoughts or when you’re in a mood it doesn’t matter how good the beans are, the coffee is not going to taste as good as it does when you’re full of joy.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1591305770/oirpaz7p8cl1f0gvzxir.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>And the best way to be full of joy when you extract your cold brew is by playing your favorite songs. <strong>Music fills so many corners of our lives to shape our mood, emotions and outlook on life</strong>. Why shouldn’t the power of music also be a part of how we extract our coffee?</p>

<p>Steeping coffee beans for 10 hours creates a breeding ground for germs to thrive due to the long hours of coffee extraction, especially in hot weather.</p>

Cold brew has become a popular choice by coffee lovers over recent years for a few reasons. It has a lower acidity to regularly brewed coffee and fans of it report a less bitter taste, the flavors often being sweet with a smoother texture.

 The big drawback of cold brew is making it. To achieve the unique result of cold brew the coffee beans are steeped for more than 10 hours in cold water.
 
“More than 10 ten hours? But if I leave it overnight I’ll have fresh cold brew in the morning, right?”

Not only is making it at home a lot of time and effort, but the amount of coffee you get is so small that it hardly seems worth bothering. It certainly won’t satisfy your morning craving.
 
 “But I’m hooked on cold brew! There has to be an easier way to make it at home!”

“I’ve always beensensitive to caffeine, but don’t want to drink decaf alone. I wish there was a way to enjoy reduced caffeine drinks at home.” 
 
 As coffee lovers and professional baristas, we searched far and wide for a cold-brew coffee solution that would address all these problems. We couldn’t find anything.

 
 
 
 

 


 
Sonic Dutch is an innovation in cold-brewing coffee technology, making cold brew coffee in only 5 minutes, by utilizing the advanced sonic wave engineering.
This not only saves you precious time when you are on the go, but also solves your typical “hygienic issues” involved in the conventional cold brewing making process. Because of long hours waiting for cold brew to be ready, there can be exposure to contamination such as E. coli and other germs.
As well, you get to control the richness of the flavor by customizing the intensity and frequency control of the sonic wave.
In other words - a tech-loving coffee-drinker’s dream.
 
 
 

 
Make Cold Brew with Sound Wave Technology?
It might sound like a strange concept, but thanks to this new technology that connects sound waves in speakers to a new magnetic circuit, the machine can extract Cold Brew Coffee quickly, easily and safely through waves generated by precision vertical vibrations.

 



 
 
 
 
TRIED & TESTED RESULTS!
Sonic Dutch can produce cold brew in as little as five minutes. And we can prove it!

We undertook an experiment to measure the density of cold brew coffee produced by traditional cold brew extraction methods and Sonic Dutch. Using 100g of coffee with 500ml of water with the Sonic Dutch we tried the 5, 10, and 15 minute settings respectively. Results showed cold brewing for 5 minutes by Sonic Dutch is as dense as the results brewed for 10 hours by the regular methods.

 
 
 
The baristas who tasted our cold brew said the coffee brewed for 5-10 minutes by Sonic Dutch had the best taste. More than 90% of our taste testers said our cold brew coffee tasted softer and smoother than using the usual extraction methods.
 

 
What these taste tests prove is that the cold brew coffee Sonic Dutch extracts is the pure essence of the coffee, so therefore it has much lower caffeine levels than regular cold brew and the taste is much sweeter. None of that bitterness associated with regular coffee. We know our cold brew is the new, leading way to extract your cold brew.
 
 
 


 
The practical design of the Sonic Dutch means as well as making coffee, it plays your music with a full traditional speaker aesthetic.  

The practical design of the Sonic Dutch means as well as making coffee, it plays your music with a full traditional speaker aesthetic.   
 
 
 

Straightforward, functional machine with cold brew available at a simple touch of a button.
 
 
 

 
 Connect your phone via Bluetooth and enjoy your favorite beats via the built-in speakers while your cold brew whizzes whips up a liter of cold brew in a mere five minutes.

 
 
I wholly believe that because coffee contains the heart of the person who extracts it, the taste of all coffee is dependent on who extracts it.
So, if you extract coffee with negative thoughts or when you’re in a mood it doesn’t matter how good the beans are, the coffee is not going to taste as good as it does when you’re full of joy.

 
And the best way to be full of joy when you extract your cold brew is by playing your favorite songs. Music fills so many corners of our lives to shape our mood, emotions and outlook on life. Why shouldn’t the power of music also be a part of how we extract our coffee?
 
 

 
 
 
 

 

  What’s unique about Sonic Dutch cold brew is its ability to produce coffee at lower caffeine rates so if you struggle with regular levels due to digestion issues or insomnia, the Sonic Dutch cold brew has you covered.

 
 

Steeping coffee beans for 10 hours creates a breeding ground for germs to thrive due to the long hours of coffee extraction, especially in hot weather.
The Sonic Dutch works so quickly that there isn’t time for germs to breed and the risk of E.Coli and other such nasties is eliminated.

 
 
 
 

 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

Do you enjoy a nice glass of vino? Our unique sonic wave technology can even be used for decanting wine! Why is this beneficial? Well, studies show that decanting wine can enhance its flavor so you can savor the depth in its taste and appreciate a full-bodied aroma and avail of the best experience from your wine.

 
 
 
 

If you are a tea lover and wants to have fresh cold milk tea for your afternoon tea time, Sonic Dutch is your perfect companion. Steep your favorite tea for 20-30 minutes with Sonic Dutch for the perfect rich yet fresh flavor of your cold milk tea. (Usually, cold brewing tea takes 8-14 hours!)

 
 
If you want to enjoy simply the tea only, steep the tea leaves in cold or room temperature water. For faster extraction, we recommend to grind the tea leaves.

<br/>What is Stokli?</h2>
<p>We are a general store on a mission to strengthen our regional food security for dry goods and pantry staples.  Legumes, grains, spices, dried herbs, flours, kitchen salt, bath salt, and more. Folks can shop in-store, online, or subscribe to our bi-monthly Stokli Subscription box program.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Who is Stokli for?</h2>
<p><strong>For Locals—</strong><br/>We offer delivery, curbside pick up, and in store shopping for local Santa Fe residents.<br/><br/><strong>For Neighboring States—</strong><br/>We offer online shopping, standard shipping for those who live in bordering states (AZ, CO, OK, TX, UT)</p>
<p><strong>For folks in the Lower 48—</strong><br/>We are happy to ship, and in addition to standard shipping costs, these orders will also include a flat $5 environmental fee, 100% of which will be donated to an environmentally focused non-profit organization.</p> <h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Why Now?</h2>
<p>Our vision for Stokli (stock-lee) revolves around the idea of empowering local growers and makers.  We aim to be a consistent platform, strengthening both supply and demand chains in a long term effort to increase accessibility to dry goods within our region. <br/> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">We have a few goals...</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>To make it easy for folks to stock their pantry with local and handcrafted foods &amp; goods.</p></li>
<li><p>To provide a consistent channel of distribution for growers and makers</p></li>
<li><p>To increase food security in our community through a variety of programs and partnerships (starting with our buy one/give one model for select pantry staples)</p></li>
<li><p>To learn, explore and find ways to participate in impactful methods of shifting economic power to marginalized voices in our community.</p></li>
</ul> <h2 style=""text-align: center;"">For those located in<br/>or around Santa Fe</h2>
<p>Stokli will be a hub for local and organic pantry staples, dry goods, with a coffee &amp; tea shop inside. Now we will be able to expand our offerings, offer curb-side pick up in addition to delivery, and be open for regular shop hours.<br/> </p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The Story</h2>
<p>Hi! We're Marianne and Hans. For the past 15 years, we've been working as a chef and designer, dreaming of opening a shop &amp; cafe. This year our little dream turned into a big vision.  When the pandemic hit, our catering business Daya shifted to delivering pantry goods that were hard to find around town.</p>
<p>We had no idea how the following months would teach us, challenge us, and ultimately inspire us to change our lives. We look at Stokli as a long-term project—<strong><i>empowering local growers and makers, celebrating our community, and joining in the effort to increase food security in our region.</i></strong><br/> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1592966292/zwsjw4jnllgtelqua760.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><br/>Stokli is inspired by the Swiss and German word “Stockli”. According to Swiss tradition, every farm should have one: a stone home for the retired farmer so they can keep an eye on the younger generation. While farmers are our heroes and we're far from retired, this felt like a perfect name that reflects our aim to support local farms while looking to the future. </p>
<p><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1593376438/mpykpcmkosw12yb4z8fw.jpg"" src=""""/><br/> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Stokli Box Subscriptions</h2>
</div><div>
<p>For those of you who want an easy way to stay stocked up on the good stuff:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boxes are filled with a delightful assortment of local pantry staples, dry goods, and New Mexico specialties. (5-7 items in each box)</li>
<li>Boxes are sent out Bi-Monthly (6 boxes per year)</li>
<li>Boxes include a postcard with a recipe and a maker/grower story</li>
<li>Free Shipping for out of town folks/pick-up is available for locals  </li>
<li>Boxes will be different each time and might include things like <i>blue corn flour, dried red chiles, lavender sea salt, pinto beans, preserves, a bar of handmade soap, and a postcard with a recipe for blue corn tortillas and a story about the farmers that grow and dry the pinto beans. <i> </i></i>Again, each box will be curated with a packed assortment of ingredients and specialty foods for foodies that want to level up their shopping list.<br/> </li>
</ul>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">
<br/>More than a Store</h2>
<p>We consider Stokli a community project as well as a general store.</p>
<ul>
<li>How can our participation as a focused dry goods platform shift the supply, demand, and distribution chains in the future?</li>
<li>How can our shop actively work to shift food equity to marginalized members of our community?</li>
<li>How can we continually explore how our sustainable goals can integrate with and take into consideration the structural violence that has been historically perpetuated by well-intentioned environmental justice initiatives of the past?</li>
<li>How can we support and encourage the next generation of New Mexico growers and makers?</li>
</ul>
<p>While we have a few ideas, we will be in a continual state of learning and listening.  </p>

<h3> </h3>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Shining a Light on Local Growers</h2>
<p>There is pretty much nowhere we’d rather be than at the Santa Fe Farmers Market. Farmers markets provide vital direct business opportunities for farms. Our General Store model aims to provide additional revenue streams for existing farmers and helping new farmers grow into their capacity to sell at markets and beyond. <br/> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1592940155/bnmry5h4kkvukcivnnyp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><br/>We aim to provide farmers with additional stability, flexibility, and increased autonomy.

</div></div>","What is Stokli?
We are a general store on a mission to strengthen our regional food security for dry goods and pantry staples.  Legumes, grains, spices, dried herbs, flours, kitchen salt, bath salt, and more. Folks can shop in-store, online, or subscribe to our bi-monthly Stokli Subscription box program.

Who is Stokli for?
For Locals—We offer delivery, curbside pick up, and in store shopping for local Santa Fe residents.For Neighboring States—We offer online shopping, standard shipping for those who live in bordering states (AZ, CO, OK, TX, UT)
For folks in the Lower 48—We are happy to ship, and in addition to standard shipping costs, these orders will also include a flat $5 environmental fee, 100% of which will be donated to an environmentally focused non-profit organization. Why Now?
Our vision for Stokli (stock-lee) revolves around the idea of empowering local growers and makers.  We aim to be a consistent platform, strengthening both supply and demand chains in a long term effort to increase accessibility to dry goods within our region.  
We have a few goals...

To make it easy for folks to stock their pantry with local and handcrafted foods & goods.
To provide a consistent channel of distribution for growers and makers
To increase food security in our community through a variety of programs and partnerships (starting with our buy one/give one model for select pantry staples)
To learn, explore and find ways to participate in impactful methods of shifting economic power to marginalized voices in our community.
 For those located inor around Santa Fe
Stokli will be a hub for local and organic pantry staples, dry goods, with a coffee & tea shop inside. Now we will be able to expand our offerings, offer curb-side pick up in addition to delivery, and be open for regular shop hours. 

 
How it works



 
The Story
Hi! We're Marianne and Hans. For the past 15 years, we've been working as a chef and designer, dreaming of opening a shop & cafe. This year our little dream turned into a big vision.  When the pandemic hit, our catering business Daya shifted to delivering pantry goods that were hard to find around town.
We had no idea how the following months would teach us, challenge us, and ultimately inspire us to change our lives. We look at Stokli as a long-term project—empowering local growers and makers, celebrating our community, and joining in the effort to increase food security in our region. 

Stokli is inspired by the Swiss and German word “Stockli”. According to Swiss tradition, every farm should have one: a stone home for the retired farmer so they can keep an eye on the younger generation. While farmers are our heroes and we're far from retired, this felt like a perfect name that reflects our aim to support local farms while looking to the future. 
 
Stokli Box Subscriptions

For those of you who want an easy way to stay stocked up on the good stuff:

Boxes are filled with a delightful assortment of local pantry staples, dry goods, and New Mexico specialties. (5-7 items in each box)
Boxes are sent out Bi-Monthly (6 boxes per year)
Boxes include a postcard with a recipe and a maker/grower story
Free Shipping for out of town folks/pick-up is available for locals  
Boxes will be different each time and might include things like blue corn flour, dried red chiles, lavender sea salt, pinto beans, preserves, a bar of handmade soap, and a postcard with a recipe for blue corn tortillas and a story about the farmers that grow and dry the pinto beans.  Again, each box will be curated with a packed assortment of ingredients and specialty foods for foodies that want to level up their shopping list. 



More than a Store
We consider Stokli a community project as well as a general store.

How can our participation as a focused dry goods platform shift the supply, demand, and distribution chains in the future?
How can our shop actively work to shift food equity to marginalized members of our community?
How can we continually explore how our sustainable goals can integrate with and take into consideration the structural violence that has been historically perpetuated by well-intentioned environmental justice initiatives of the past?
How can we support and encourage the next generation of New Mexico growers and makers?

While we have a few ideas, we will be in a continual state of learning and listening.  


 
Shining a Light on Local Growers
There is pretty much nowhere we’d rather be than at the Santa Fe Farmers Market. Farmers markets provide vital direct business opportunities for farms. Our General Store model aims to provide additional revenue streams for existing farmers and helping new farmers grow into their capacity to sell at markets and beyond.  

We aim to provide farmers with additional stability, flexibility, and increased autonomy. With increased revenues, growers and producers can choose (with alleviated pressure) which wholesale and direct sales are most profitable and satisfying. We aim to be a hub for dry goods and hope to provide farmers consistent sales, help them move excess inventories, and be a friend and partner during colder months. 

 

Giving  ̶B̶a̶c̶k̶  Up
Over the past months, we have seen the fragility of the food supply chain. We don’t kid ourselves about the complexity of the system. But we know when demand increases, the potential for new pathways and innovation increases as well.  

When we launched the Daya online General Store, it felt somewhat like an emergency response. Ever since we have been selling our pantry staples at wholesale pricing to make these basic foods as accessible as possible. While this has lit us up and kept us going during these hard months, we realized that we haven’t been reaching everyone. The General Store will include a buy-one-give-one model where when select pantry items are purchased an equal amount will be given to a local organization working to feed those in need.  
What we Needand What you get

We have found a space that is uniquely equipped to allow us to open and grow carefully through these turbulent times. If we reach our goal, funds will go towards:

<li>
<strong>Sustained Mental Energy:</strong> IQ Bars flip the conventional bar's macro-nutritional profile on its head. They're HIGH in healthy fats and LOW in net carbs (total carbs - fiber). That means less blood sugar ""roller coasters"" and more ""smooth sailing in the sun"" mental energy.</li>
<li>
<strong>Critical Brain Nutrients:</strong> IQ Bars are optimized around a unique mix of 5 brain-critical compounds: fiber, medium-chain-triglycerides (MCT's), omega-3's, flavonoids, and vitamin-E. These nutrients were chosen for their strong links to positive brain outcomes in scientific literature.</li>

Sustained Mental Energy: IQ Bars flip the conventional bar's macro-nutritional profile on its head. They're HIGH in healthy fats and LOW in net carbs (total carbs - fiber). That means less blood sugar ""roller coasters"" and more ""smooth sailing in the sun"" mental energy.

Critical Brain Nutrients: IQ Bars are optimized around a unique mix of 5 brain-critical compounds: fiber, medium-chain-triglycerides (MCT's), omega-3's, flavonoids, and vitamin-E. These nutrients were chosen for their strong links to positive brain outcomes in scientific literature.

Whole Food Ingredients: You won't find words that start with ""X"" and sound like cleaning agents on our labels. We formulated only with ingredients an 8-year-old could find in a grocery store because Mother Nature got things right in the first place.
Ok, those are the SparkNotes. Let's dig a bit deeper...  Healthy Fats + Low Net Carbs = Cognitive StaminaCarbs are great...if you're climbing Mount Kilimanjaro. For the 99.999% of time you're NOT doing that, your brain and body operates more efficiently on smooth-burning healthy fats.That's why IQ Bars are packed with healthy fats and contain just 8-9g of net carbs per bar. We also included 12g of fiber/bar to slow the absorption of those net carbs. Here's how our macro-nutritional profile stacks up with other bars:  To make the comparison more real between carb-based energy (from the ""other guys"") and healthy-fat-based energy (from IQ Bars), let's chart out what your brain feels like throughout the day on both: For more info and supporting research studies, check out the High-Fat/Low-Net-Carb section of our website. The right nutrient mix = better cognitive performanceWhen deciding which compounds to optimize IQ Bars for, we considered only those those with substantial links to positive brain outcomes in scientific literature. Here are the 5 we ultimately selected:What's special about these compounds is they've been shown to provide both overlapping brain benefits (e.g., all are anti-inflammatory in some way), as well as individualized benefits. In aggregate, studies have linked our 5 nutrients to positive outcomes in the following areas:For more info and specific studies, check out the Critical Nutrients section of our website. Real food only: better nutrition, better tasteNumerous studies have found whole foods to have superior nutritional value over their constituent parts, largely because nutrients in whole foods are typically more bioavailable (absorbable and useful) to us.This is why - while many approach the ""brain hacking"" space with pills and tonics - we do so with REAL FOOD that has inputs you can actually pronounce. You won't find bizarre words like ""Xanthan Gum"" and ""Erythritol"" on our packaging because you should be able to understand, trust, and relate to the food you put in your body. IQ Bars come in 3 delicious flavors, each with an uncompromising taste and nutritional profile. Almond CacaoCalling all chocolate lovers! With the Almond Cacao IQ Bar, we combined flavonoid-rich cacao, vitamin-E-packed almonds, and tons of other brain-boosting goodness into 45 grams. Feel free to satisfy those choco-cravings guilt-free...and feel smarter for it.  INGREDIENTS: Almonds,Walnuts, Coconut Flakes, Dates, Cacao Nibs, Cacao Powder, Chia Seeds, Chicory Root Fiber, Pink Himalayan Sea Salt Blueberry WalnutBlueberries and walnuts are not just delicious - they're often cited as leading all other fruits and nuts in brain benefits! So, we figured we'd combine them with a few other nutrient rock stars and see what you guys thought. If you're looking to load up on omega-3's in particular, this bar's got your name all over it.INGREDIENTS: Blueberries,Walnuts, Coconut Flakes, Sunflower Seeds, Almonds, Dates, Cacao Nibs, Cacao Powder, Chia Seeds, Chicory Root Fiber, Pink Himalayan Sea Salt Matcha HazelnutMmmm...Matcha. The delicious green leaf that has no patience for inflammation and free radicals. And let's not forget hazelnuts, a vitamin-E powerhouse. You simply won't find another bar on the market sporting this dynamic duo. We can't tell you how many people who ""didn't like matcha"" we've converted with this green goodness.INGREDIENTS: Hazelnuts, Almonds,Walnuts, Coconut Flakes, Dates, Matcha, Cacao Nibs, Chia Seeds, Chicory Root Fiber, Pink Himalayan Sea Salt Show me the labels already!   ""How'd We Get Here?"" by Will NitzeWhile studying psychology and neuroscience at Harvard, I became fascinated with the human brain. Then, upon entering the workforce, I began experiencing difficulties with my own brain. Mental fatigue and lack of clarity were daily struggles. In search of a quick-and-easy solution, I turned to sugary snacks and caffeinated drinks, yet this just made matters worse - adding sharp energy crashes to my list of cognitive issues.Desperate for stability, I researched and self-tested every lifestyle alteration I could think of. Improved exercise and sleep failed to move the needle. Amphetamines and “nootropic” pills entailed unacceptable risk of dependency and adverse side effects. Eventually, I discovered and experimented with the high-fat/low-net-carb diet promoted by brain nutrition experts like Dr. David Perlmutter and Dr. Mark Hyman. Within weeks of trading bread and pasta for nuts and avocados, I achieved a remarkable rebound in my cognitive performance!Astonished by the impact diet had on my mental acuity, I vowed to share my experience with millions of others struggling to stay sharp. I decided the best way to accomplish this goal was to create and democratize “brain food”. Thus, I set out on a year-long mission to develop all-natural nutrition bars with ingredients shown to support both short-term cognitive function, and long-term brain health.

<p>GO CUBES is a project by our company, <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/go-cubes-chewable-coffee/x/www.nootrobox.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Nootrobox</a>. We named our company Nootrobox after the term ""nootropics,"" which are ingredients known to safely improve cognitive performance on exams, stressful days, and other mentally demanding tasks. The ingredients are based on thorough scientific research, and we've made a name for being <a href=""http://fusion.net/story/58131/i-tried-silicon-valleys-favorite-brain-enhancing-drugs/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""Silicon Valley's favorite brain-enhancers""</a> and for having <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/nootropics-from-nootrobox-2014-8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">stellar reviews</a> from top publications. We have thousands of subscribers to our current products and have shipped hundreds of thousands of servings across the world, but we aren't stopping there! </p>
<p>GO CUBES isn't just caffeine. We've crammed in a full nootropic stack in each GO CUBE.

The Future of Coffee

If you're here, it's probably because you love coffee - and so do we! Join our campaign to help make the next innovation in coffee a reality.
GO CUBES are gummy coffee bites with delicious flavor, enhanced performance, and unprecedented convenience on the go. 





Yummy taste. GO CUBES are made with real cold-brew coffee, and they pack a serious amount of coffee into every bite (2 cubes = 1 cup of coffee). 


Convenient. Super easy to grab on the go, no mess, and cheaper than a cup of Starbucks!


Made for performance. GO CUBES are made specifically for cognitive performance, by the same people who brought you SPRINT.


GO CUBES are a new spin on a classic favorite - help us make it a reality!



Our Mission


With our background as founders of Nootrobox, we think all day about ways of helping people improve their mental performance & stay sharp all day. Before Nootrobox, coffee had always been our default pick-me-up in the past, as it is for many people. Our goal with GO CUBES is to combine what people love about coffee with what people love about Nootrobox and make a cognitive-enhancing product that's delicious, shareable, convenient, and affordable.


We are raising $20,000 to bring GO CUBES to life. We are working with amazing partners to help formulate, produce, package, and ship GO CUBES to you, and each of those partners have minimum order sizes. By getting to $20,000, we're able to get the wheels turning and make GO CUBES a reality.
We want to spread the word about a product we think is awesome, and stand behind 100%. Contribute today and you'll be among the first in the universe to try GO CUBES gummy coffee bites. We've put together a set of perks for all price points, whether you're just curious or want to be a distributor. If you aren't in a position to contribute today, then help us out by sharing the post with a friend who loves coffee. And we'll be doing giveaways on Instagram (@nootrobox) so check us out over there!


GO CUBES: Taste


GO CUBES are made with real cold-brew coffee and come in 3 delicious flavors: Pure Drip, Mocha, and Latte. (Note that each package of GO CUBES contains a random assortment of all 3.)
We are working directly with one of the largest and most reputable confectionary factories in the USA to produce GO CUBES. We've been through over 20 rounds of testing to pinpoint the exact right taste and mouthfeel profile, and have landed on something that has unanimous approval from the team.



GO CUBES: Convenience
With GO CUBES, you can bring coffee with you wherever you go, easier than ever before. 
Whether you're an astronaut in outer-space, a parent on the way to pick up the kids, or you need a quick boost on your way to class, nothing beats the no-spills convenience of GO CUBES. 

Each GO CUBE contains half of a cup of coffee, so you don't need to pack very many with you. Even with all that convenience, we've managed to keep costs low - for instance, the Becky Package contains the equivalent of 40 cups of coffee for just $50. That works out to $1.25 per cup - way less than Starbucks!



GO CUBES: Performance
GO CUBES are crafted for performance.
GO CUBES is a project by our company, Nootrobox. We named our company Nootrobox after the term ""nootropics,"" which are ingredients known to safely improve cognitive performance on exams, stressful days, and other mentally demanding tasks. The ingredients are based on thorough scientific research, and we've made a name for being ""Silicon Valley's favorite brain-enhancers"" and for having stellar reviews from top publications. We have thousands of subscribers to our current products and have shipped hundreds of thousands of servings across the world, but we aren't stopping there! 
GO CUBES isn't just caffeine. We've crammed in a full nootropic stack in each GO CUBE. B complex (accelerates metabolism), L-Theanine (an amino acid found in green tea), and other compounds that stack well with caffeine round out a highly performant nootropic in each yummy bite.
For the numbers-minded folks out there, each GO CUBE is 35 calories and contains the following amount of active ingredients. A typical serving size is 2.

Caffeine 50 mg **
Vitamin B-3 (Niacinamide) 25 mg 125%
Vitamin B-6 (Pyridoxine Hydrochloride) 10 mg 500% 
Vitamin B-12 (Methylcobalamin) 30 mcg 500%
Folic Acid (Folic Acid) 500 mcg 125% 
Theanine (L-Theanine) 100mg **
Glucuronolactone (Glucuronolactone) 125 mg **
Inositol (Inositol) 125 mg **
GO CUBES is a delicious way of bringing the legendary Nootrobox performance to coffee lovers everywhere.





Testimonials
GO CUBES have that delicious caffè taste that would make Gustavo's gramma get up and dance. Unfortunately, Gustavo is a professional actor (who's actually a ton of fun to hang out with in real life, but that's a story for another time.). We do, however, have dozens of testimonials from our early testers. Here are a few --


The Team
The team is led by Geoffrey Woo and Michael Brandt. Geoff is from LA and Michael is from Chicago, and we met and became friends at Stanford University back in 2007. Based on a passion for performance and helping people hit their full potential, we started Nootrobox one year ago. Thanks to a huge amount of support, suggestions, and retweets from people like you, Nootrobox has launched several popular products. We take pride in quality products and a brand that's both smart and down-to-earth. We've been working on GO CUBES for 6 months, and we're excited to share it with you!



Our broader team hails from top MD/PhD programs in the nation, master supply chain & production specialists from pharmaceutical-grade facilities, and technologists with pedigrees from top-tier tech companies. We started one year ago and we've already been featured in many national and international press outlets

Select the Barista's Special.  If all you want is the Barista's Special, then just continue through the purchase flow, you can skip these instructions :)


If you'd like to add a perk besides just the Barista's Special, add in the appropriate dollar amount for that perk as an ""Additional Gift"".

Note: the distributor packs are already available for worldwide shipping and do not require the addition of a Barista's Special.

That's why we decided to create one that would concentrate the best qualities of all the existing cups and that would enhance the pleasure of tasting our espresso every time with people we love.Our innovative cup combines all the qualities of great espresso cups into one. (FR) Il existe déjà des millions de tasses à expresso différentes, mais aucune ne nous satisfait parfaitement. C'est pourquoi nous avons décidé d'en créer une qui concentrerait les meilleures qualités de toutes les tasses existantes et renforcerait le plaisir de déguster notre expresso à chaque fois avec les gens qu'on aime.Notre tasse innovante combine toutes les qualités d'une parfaite tasse à espresso.  It's scientifically proven, 90% of what we perceive as a flavor comes from our sense of smell. To design our coffee cup that enhances the flavor, we chose the balloon shape that is very use for wine glasses.The PARISIANA cup works like a balloon wineglass. Its curves help to concentrate the aromas above the cup. In addition, this form makes it possible to compact the coffee foam when it is formed to make it tastier.In addition, visually, it gives your espresso an unique pearl shape that makes it even more delicious. (FR) C'est scientifiquement prouvé, 90% de ce que nous percevons comme une saveur provient de notre odorat. Pour concevoir notre tasse à café qui rehausse la saveur, nous avons choisis la forme de ballon qui est très utilisée pour les verres à vin.La tasse PARISIANA fonctionne comme un verre ballon pour le vin. Ses courbes aident à concentrer les arômes au-dessus de la tasse. De plus, cette forme permet de compacter la mousse de café lorsqu'elle se forme pour la rendre délicieuse.De plus, visuellement, elle donne à votre l'expresso une forme de perle unique qui le rend encore plus savoureux.    The coffee cup ""PARISIANA"" has been designed by a designer who loves coffee. Each of the lines has been designed to allow you to enjoy your espresso like never before. This cup will make the tasting of an espresso more enjoyable.Thus, its shape in a wine balloon allows:
to direct the aromas above the cup to concentrate them in your nostrils, 
to increase the volume of the foam thanks to the meniscus,
to densify the foam,
to give your coffee a pearl shape to make it beautiful, 
to keep the coffee grounds that could spoil the tasting.
  (FR) La tasse à café ""PARISIANA"" a été conçue par un designer qui adore le café. Chacune des lignes a été conçue pour vous permettre de savourer votre espresso comme jamais auparavant. Cette tasse rendra la dégustation de votre expresso plus agréable.Ainsi, sa forme en ballon à vin permet :
de diriger les arômes au-dessus de la coupe pour les concentrer dans les narines,
d'augmenter le volume de la mousse grâce au ménisque,
de densifier la mousse,
de donner à votre café une forme de perle pour le rendre beau,
de garder le marc de café qui pourrait gâcher la dégustation.
 Have you ever seen such a delicious, dense and thick foam? The balloon shape creates turbulence favorable to the foam and makes it more compact once at the top. The lovely glass handle allows you to take coffee without burning and without cooling the coffee.The glass thickness of 3mm keeps the coffee warm without cooling it. It is largely sufficient for professional quality. The cup looks really solid in the hand.The foot gives the illusion that the coffee floats and allows to put it on a table without burning it and without cooling the coffee. The saucer is no longer necessary.This cup is the first cup in the world that can be suspendable like a wine glass but also stack to simplify storage.It is very strong and easy to wash by hand or in the dishwasher. The cup goes to the oven up to 500 ° C because it is made of high quality borosilicate glass.  (FR) La belle poignée en verre vous permet de prendre le café sans se brûler et sans le refroidir.L'épaisseur de verre épaisse de 3 mm maintient le café au chaud sans le refroidir. Elle est largement suffisante pour une qualité professionnelle. La tasse paraît très solide dans la main.Le pied donne l’illusion que le café flotte et permet de le poser sur une table sans le brûler et sans refroidir le café. La soucoupe n'est plus nécessaire.Cette tasse est la première tasse au monde à pouvoir être suspendue comme un verre à vin mais également peut également s'empilée pour en simplifier le stockage.La tasse est très résistante et facile à laver à la main ou au lave-vaisselle. La tasse va au four jusqu'à 500°C car elle est en verre borosilicate de haute qualité.    The saucer also attaches perfectly to the cup to preserve heat while presenting the spoon, cookie or sugar.           PARISIANA coffee cups can also land on machines but it's more stylish & professional on rails;)      (FR: PARISIANA résiste à des températures jusqu'à 500°C. Vous pouvez l'utiliser pour cuire des entrées dans un four ou réchauffer votre café dans un four micro-ondes sans problème.)   The cup is made with a single component of high quality borosilicate glass. There is no glue, the glass is baked at over 1500°C.   You can also use your cups PARISIANA to present :
your aperitifs,
your entries,
your desserts,
your cocktails or
your shooters.
With the PARISIANA cup, imagine all the happiness pearls you could create for your family and friends.The creative possibilities are limitless.  (FR) Vous pouvez également utiliser vos tasses PARISIANA pour présenter:

Avec la tasse PARISIANA, imaginez toutes les bulles de bonheur que vous pourrez créer pour votre famille et vos amis.Les possibilités créatives sont illimitées.   PARISIANA is an original way to present your shooters or cocktails.        Everyone knows or has heard about the city of Paris in France and its culture of Parisian cafés. France is also very popular for its wine culture and its famous wines.(FR) Tout le monde connaît ou a entendu parler de la ville de Paris en France et de sa culture des cafés parisiens. La France est également très populaire pour sa culture du vin et ses célèbres vins.  But do you know that when the coffee beans arrived in Paris, Parisians were drinking their coffee in wine glasses? Simply because when the coffee beans arrived, all the Parisian cafes did not have ceramic cups. Still today, some Parisian cafes still serve your espresso in a wine glass at the counter in memory of that.This PARISIANA coffee cup has a shape inspired by this story, offering a unique design and ideal characteristics to enjoy a good espresso as you would enjoy a good glass of wine.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.cocoaandspice.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cocoa &amp; Spice</a> will be relocating to York Place on the Downtown Mall in Charlottesville, VA. We created this project so we can offer <strong>new interactive experiences</strong> to the Charlottesville community and <strong>create a chocolate destination</strong> that everyone will love. Below you can read more about <strong>what we want to create</strong>, our journey, how we give back to the community, relocation expenses, and <strong>how you can help</strong>! And if you read all the way to the end we'll include a few fun facts about owner/chocolatier, Jennifer Mowad.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Want To Create</h3>
<p>Mentoring CAYIP &amp; Mountaintop Montessori interns has inspired us to create this project. You can read more about them in the <i>Cocoa &amp; Spice Gives Back</i> section. Over the years we've taught them how to work with chocolate and guided them as they created their own product. Our customers have been asking for chocolate classes and we're pleased to announce you can temper some chocolate with us beginning this Fall. As an Indiegogo backer you'll be among the first to experience these opportunities at York Place! In addition to classes and private events we've outlined a few other ideas we will be implementing in the new space. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Create Your Own Chocolate Bar</strong> -  Private hands-on class for 2 guests. Create your own chocolate bar using milk, white, or dark chocolate. We'll provide you with a variety of spices, flavors, &amp; toppings for you to create something unique. Name your bar and we'll design a label for you to wrap your finished product. Take home 6 bars to share with family/friends - or keep them all to yourself! </li>
<li>
<strong>Chocolatier Class</strong> -  Private hands-on class for 4 guests. Cocoa will demonstrate how to make a chocolate shell and fill it with our signature salted caramel sauce. Then it's your turn! Learn how to decorate a chocolate mold with cocoa butter, create a chocolate shell, fill it with delicious caramel, cap it with more chocolate, and release it from the mold. Each guest will create a 4pc box to bring home! </li>
<li>
<strong>Private Events</strong> -  Who wouldn't want to have a private party inside a chocolate shop! Now offering private 2 hour parties for up to 12 guests. We'll load the store with samples for you and your guests to enjoy throughout the evening. Cocoa will demonstrate how she makes our signature dark chocolate salted caramel.</li>
<li>
<strong>Custom Wedding/Party Favors</strong> -  We'll help you select the perfect Cocoa &amp; Spice product for your event. Visit our store to taste a variety of products, review packaging options, &amp; design a custom label. This is ideal for events taking place in Charlottesville, but we are happy to discuss delivery &amp; shipping options for out of town backers (additional cost).</li>
<li>
<strong>Warm Brownie</strong> -  According to our customers we make the best brownie in Charlottesville! We'll warm it up for you and let you select 2 toppings to create your own masterpiece - Cocoa's favorite is salted caramel sauce &amp; toasted coconut! </li>
<li>
<strong>Chocolate Library</strong> - We want to bring craft bean to bar chocolate from around the United States (and eventually the world) to Charlottesville! Cocoa has already met with chocolate maker William Marx in Madison, WI and visited Charm School Chocolate in Hunt Valley, MD. Over the next couple of months we'll meet with other chocolate makers so we can fill our library with a variety of chocolate for you to check out (pun intended).</li>
<li>
<strong>Vendor Pop-Up Events</strong> - We know first hand how difficult it can be to set-up as a vendor outside - rain, wind, extreme heat, etc. We'll be inviting vendors from the Charlottesville City Market to set-up shop for a day. We consider them our work family and look forward to collaborating with anyone interested.</li>
<li>
<strong>First Fridays</strong> - Cocoa &amp; Spice is a member of the Crozet Artisan Depot &amp; C'Ville Arts which has enabled us to make connections with many local artists. We'll host artists at the store and invite you to our First Fridays events.</li>

She started selling as a street vendor on the Downtown Mall and would walk a cart full of product and everything else needed for set-up from her apartment to one of the vendor spots. Many of our longtime customers discovered Cocoa &amp; Spice while street vending and it is where we met the staff from the City Market &amp; Sprint Pavilion to discuss our vendor applications – this is our 5th season as a vendor at both locations!</span></p>
</div><div>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><i>April 2015 – 1st day vending on the Downtown Mall</i></p>
<p>In 2017 Cocoa &amp; Spice moved production to a commercial kitchen on Stewart Street - most people don't know where that is so we created this map to help customers find the place. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1563894165/kqtrl2rpezyfkuiopdlu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

With the help of family &amp; friends we made improvements to the store to create a warm &amp; welcoming environment for customers.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Stewart Street has been a great space to grow our business and we've loved sharing what we created with our customers! Now it is time for us to expand and move to a new location that is spacious enough for us to host private parties &amp; chocolate classes. We're headed back to where we started - from street vendor to store front owner - Charlottesville, Downtown Mall, Fall 2019!</span></p>

<h3>Relocation Expenses</h3>
<p>We've outlined many of our expenses below. We're only asking for <u><strong>$2,500</strong></u> to get us started, BUT <u><strong>we'd love to raise $10,000</strong></u> so we don't have to delay any of our improvements. </p>
<ul>
<li>Plumbing ($1,000) - Most of the plumbing is already in place. We'll be shifting one of the lines and need to have sinks installed in the kitchen.</li>
<li>Electrical ($1,700) - We can't make our brownies without the right connection for our oven. We'll need to add this connection plus a few more standard outlets and overhead lights.</li>
<li>Lighting ($1,500) - We want you to see our chocolate! The previous tenant left some lighting unfinished and we'll need to add a few more to make our product shine.</li>
<li>Painting - Gray doesn't scream CHOCOLATE. We're gonna pick out something colorful for most of the store and add a fun design as an accent wall. </li>
<li>Signage - Amyrose from Nouveau designed our logo and signage at the current location. She's mocking up some designs for the new space and we love her enthusiasm.</li>
<li>Carpentry - We'd like to create a viewing window so you can watch us work. We'll even add a counter so you can hang-out, chat, and enjoy a cup of drinking chocolate. Plus we need some cool looking shelves for our Chocolate Library!</li>
<li>Moving - We have some pretty heavy equipment at our current space and we refuse to ask our friends to move it for us. We'll need to hire professionals.</li>

<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>Below are a few ways you can support our vision. Please don't hesitate to ask any questions via phone, email, or in person!</p>
<ul>
<li>Back our project - We've created a variety of pledges and rewards to engage the community with our project. Select the one that works for you and we will be forever grateful!</li>
<li>Share our project - Financial support is not the only way to help (though it is appreciated). Even if you can't back our project right now we'd love it if you can share it with your family, friends, co-workers, anyone!</li>
<li>Sublease our current store - We've outlined this in the Risks and Challenges section. We're looking for someone to sublease our Stewart Street location until April 30, 2020.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<u>Double rent</u> - The lease at my current space does not end until April 30, 2020. I had not planned to relocate until next year, but when I was presented with the opportunity to move to York Place this year I couldn't pass. I have budgeted for double rent for August &amp; September and plan to sublease the remaining 7 months. If I am not able to find someone to sublease it will cost me almost $15,000 which will have a significant impact on both my personal &amp; business finances for the next year. If you or someone you know is interested in subleasing my current space please contact me immediately!</li>
<li>
<u>Construction delay &amp; cost increase</u> - During my initial meetings with a plumber &amp; electrician I was informed the work I need done is minimal and should take no more than two weeks to complete. Once they start the project there is always the risk of an issue that will increase both the timeline &amp; cost. Pending any timing delays I can continue to work out of my current space. A significant increase in budget may delay the relocation until I can secure more funding.</li>
<li>
<u>Lose customers because of relocation</u> - Prior to signing the lease at York Place I asked many of my customers if the move would impact their ability to shop at Cocoa &amp; Spice. Most said they are excited for the move and will be able to shop more. However, A few did tell me they like the convenience of parking at my current spot (I have 5 dedicated spots) and they don't go downtown that often. I plan to follow up with these customers to see what I can do to keep their business.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to review our project. We'll be posting progress updates throughout the campaign!</p>

<h3>Fun Facts About Cocoa:</h3>

<li>When I was 3 year's old I was so excited to find my Easter basket I fell over. I then proceeded to hit my head on the basket while eating an egg (the video abruptly stopped at that point).</li>
<li>Throughout grade school we had to sell chocolate bars as a fundraiser - I earned a bike selling over 20 boxes (72 bars per box)!</li>
<li>I was paid to make ice cream pies &amp; novelties at our local grocery store in Nutley, NJ.</li>
<li>In college I made one of those ice cream pies for a college professor as part of a pitch in one of my business classes.</li>
<li>The first chocolate product I ever made was a giant peanut butter cup - with unsweetened baker's chocolate - it tasted terrible! I enjoyed it much better once I switched to bittersweet chocolate.</li>
<li>I didn't have an umbrella my first day vending on the Downtown Mall and the sun melted the ear of one of my chocolate bunnies. </li>
<li>While apprenticing at East Van Roasters in Vancouver, BC I burned a pot of caramel and the fire department showed up :(</li>
<li>Many years ago I submitted a cover letter, resume, and chocolate portfolio to a well known chocolate shop two years in a row - I was never contacted for an interview, so I decided to start my own business!</li>

</div></div>","Summary
Cocoa & Spice will be relocating to York Place on the Downtown Mall in Charlottesville, VA. We created this project so we can offer new interactive experiences to the Charlottesville community and create a chocolate destination that everyone will love. Below you can read more about what we want to create, our journey, how we give back to the community, relocation expenses, and how you can help! And if you read all the way to the end we'll include a few fun facts about owner/chocolatier, Jennifer Mowad.


What We Want To Create
Mentoring CAYIP & Mountaintop Montessori interns has inspired us to create this project. You can read more about them in the Cocoa & Spice Gives Back section. Over the years we've taught them how to work with chocolate and guided them as they created their own product. Our customers have been asking for chocolate classes and we're pleased to announce you can temper some chocolate with us beginning this Fall. As an Indiegogo backer you'll be among the first to experience these opportunities at York Place! In addition to classes and private events we've outlined a few other ideas we will be implementing in the new space. 


Create Your Own Chocolate Bar -  Private hands-on class for 2 guests. Create your own chocolate bar using milk, white, or dark chocolate. We'll provide you with a variety of spices, flavors, & toppings for you to create something unique. Name your bar and we'll design a label for you to wrap your finished product. Take home 6 bars to share with family/friends - or keep them all to yourself! 

Chocolatier Class -  Private hands-on class for 4 guests. Cocoa will demonstrate how to make a chocolate shell and fill it with our signature salted caramel sauce. Then it's your turn! Learn how to decorate a chocolate mold with cocoa butter, create a chocolate shell, fill it with delicious caramel, cap it with more chocolate, and release it from the mold. Each guest will create a 4pc box to bring home! 

Private Events -  Who wouldn't want to have a private party inside a chocolate shop! Now offering private 2 hour parties for up to 12 guests. We'll load the store with samples for you and your guests to enjoy throughout the evening. Cocoa will demonstrate how she makes our signature dark chocolate salted caramel.

Custom Wedding/Party Favors -  We'll help you select the perfect Cocoa & Spice product for your event. Visit our store to taste a variety of products, review packaging options, & design a custom label. This is ideal for events taking place in Charlottesville, but we are happy to discuss delivery & shipping options for out of town backers (additional cost).

Warm Brownie -  According to our customers we make the best brownie in Charlottesville! We'll warm it up for you and let you select 2 toppings to create your own masterpiece - Cocoa's favorite is salted caramel sauce & toasted coconut! 

Chocolate Library - We want to bring craft bean to bar chocolate from around the United States (and eventually the world) to Charlottesville! Cocoa has already met with chocolate maker William Marx in Madison, WI and visited Charm School Chocolate in Hunt Valley, MD. Over the next couple of months we'll meet with other chocolate makers so we can fill our library with a variety of chocolate for you to check out (pun intended).

Vendor Pop-Up Events - We know first hand how difficult it can be to set-up as a vendor outside - rain, wind, extreme heat, etc. We'll be inviting vendors from the Charlottesville City Market to set-up shop for a day. We consider them our work family and look forward to collaborating with anyone interested.

First Fridays - Cocoa & Spice is a member of the Crozet Artisan Depot & C'Ville Arts which has enabled us to make connections with many local artists. We'll host artists at the store and invite you to our First Fridays events.

Our Journey
Jennifer Mowad, aka Cocoa, launched Cocoa & Spice out of her home kitchen in February 2015. She started selling as a street vendor on the Downtown Mall and would walk a cart full of product and everything else needed for set-up from her apartment to one of the vendor spots. Many of our longtime customers discovered Cocoa & Spice while street vending and it is where we met the staff from the City Market & Sprint Pavilion to discuss our vendor applications – this is our 5th season as a vendor at both locations!

April 2015 – 1st day vending on the Downtown Mall
In 2017 Cocoa & Spice moved production to a commercial kitchen on Stewart Street - most people don't know where that is so we created this map to help customers find the place. 

Map to show the location of our store
 
The location was previously rented by a BBQ food cart and needed lots of TLC. With the help of family & friends we made improvements to the store to create a warm & welcoming environment for customers.
Stewart Street has been a great space to grow our business and we've loved sharing what we created with our customers! Now it is time for us to expand and move to a new location that is spacious enough for us to host private parties & chocolate classes. We're headed back to where we started - from street vendor to store front owner - Charlottesville, Downtown Mall, Fall 2019!
 
Cocoa & Spice Gives Back
The Charlottesville community has been very supportive of our journey over the years and Cocoa & Spice has given back to the community in a variety of ways:

We've hosted 6 interns through the Community Attention Youth Internship Program (CAYIP) and 2 interns from Mountaintop Montessori. Cocoa teaches the interns all about chocolate, how to operate a small business, and mentors them as they create their own product to market & sell.
Cocoa volunteers as a bench manager for the Charlottesville Derby Dames (CDD), donates brownies for them to sell at bouts, and has hosted a few fundraising events. You can find the CDD pinball machine at the store, with all proceeds going to the team.
Represent the LGBT community by participating in the annual CVille Pride Festival and displaying flags of support at the store to ensure customers know this is a safe space. We display our flags ALL YEAR ROUND!
As a young adult cancer survivor, Cocoa is involved with First Descents. She's donated a portion of sales and even closed the shop for a week on two separate occasions to volunteer as a Camp Mom - lot's and lots of dishes! We've also hosted events for local survivors at the store.

Relocation Expenses
We've outlined many of our expenses below. We're only asking for $2,500 to get us started, BUT we'd love to raise $10,000 so we don't have to delay any of our improvements. 

Plumbing ($1,000) - Most of the plumbing is already in place. We'll be shifting one of the lines and need to have sinks installed in the kitchen.
Electrical ($1,700) - We can't make our brownies without the right connection for our oven. We'll need to add this connection plus a few more standard outlets and overhead lights.
Lighting ($1,500) - We want you to see our chocolate! The previous tenant left some lighting unfinished and we'll need to add a few more to make our product shine.
Painting - Gray doesn't scream CHOCOLATE. We're gonna pick out something colorful for most of the store and add a fun design as an accent wall. 
Signage - Amyrose from Nouveau designed our logo and signage at the current location. She's mocking up some designs for the new space and we love her enthusiasm.
Carpentry - We'd like to create a viewing window so you can watch us work. We'll even add a counter so you can hang-out, chat, and enjoy a cup of drinking chocolate. Plus we need some cool looking shelves for our Chocolate Library!
Moving - We have some pretty heavy equipment at our current space and we refuse to ask our friends to move it for us. We'll need to hire professionals.

<h3>THERE IS SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT THE JAMAICAN PEANUT....</h3>
<p>That’s what Fred and Jason realized when they launched The Jamaican Peanut Butter Factory. Originally perceived as local lore, Fred and Jason went on a mission to turn these tasty nuts into the best peanut butter in the world. We are not claiming that we make the best, what we are saying is that it is the primary goal of our company is to make the best peanut butter in the world.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541554595/oxyzjia7nesxoqxq2u59.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>This is MR. MACK...</h3>
<p>He is a coffee farmer in the blue mountains and he's looking to diversify income. He is working on our test plot to determine viability of growing peanuts in the Blue Mountains.</p>
<p>Inspired by the other Jamaican Products that are among “The Best In The World” category. Fred and Jason realized that in order to achieve their goal they were going to have to break the mold in the food products category. In order to make the best, they had to use the best and that’s why the Jamaican Peanut Butter Factory only uses <strong>100%</strong> <strong>Jamaican Peanuts</strong>, <strong>100%</strong> <strong>Jamaican cold pressed Coconut</strong> <strong>Oil</strong>, <strong>100%</strong> <strong>Jamaican honey</strong> and Sea Salt. Simple Ingredients, Fantastic Peanut Butter.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need...</h3>
<p>We need your help to take our company to the next level. We have been in operation since February of 2018 and have seen rapid growth. We need your assistance so we can grow this company at a healthy rate and provide opportunities for local farmers to earn a living wage.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your funding will primarily go to creating infrastructure to meet our ever increasing demand. We are looking to move into our own facility, to purchase processing equipment, and working capital to ensure a sustainable enterprise.</li>
<li>10% of all funding raised will go directly to setting up farming co-operatives in Jamaica to teach organic farming practices, give the farmers collective bargaining as well as to provide farmers a more livable wage.</li>

</div><p> </p></div>","THERE IS SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT THE JAMAICAN PEANUT....
That’s what Fred and Jason realized when they launched The Jamaican Peanut Butter Factory. Originally perceived as local lore, Fred and Jason went on a mission to turn these tasty nuts into the best peanut butter in the world. We are not claiming that we make the best, what we are saying is that it is the primary goal of our company is to make the best peanut butter in the world.


This is MR. MACK...
He is a coffee farmer in the blue mountains and he's looking to diversify income. He is working on our test plot to determine viability of growing peanuts in the Blue Mountains.
Inspired by the other Jamaican Products that are among “The Best In The World” category. Fred and Jason realized that in order to achieve their goal they were going to have to break the mold in the food products category. In order to make the best, they had to use the best and that’s why the Jamaican Peanut Butter Factory only uses 100% Jamaican Peanuts, 100% Jamaican cold pressed Coconut Oil, 100% Jamaican honey and Sea Salt. Simple Ingredients, Fantastic Peanut Butter.

What We Need...
We need your help to take our company to the next level. We have been in operation since February of 2018 and have seen rapid growth. We need your assistance so we can grow this company at a healthy rate and provide opportunities for local farmers to earn a living wage.

Your funding will primarily go to creating infrastructure to meet our ever increasing demand. We are looking to move into our own facility, to purchase processing equipment, and working capital to ensure a sustainable enterprise.
10% of all funding raised will go directly to setting up farming co-operatives in Jamaica to teach organic farming practices, give the farmers collective bargaining as well as to provide farmers a more livable wage.



What you get...
You get our version of the best peanut butter in the world. This unbelievably delicious and addictive peanut butter will be shipped directly to your door worldwide. Look at our perks to see other interesting opportunities as well as our Forever JAMNut limited to only 20 people.

<h2>Craft spirits done in a thought provoking way  </h2>
<p><strong>This is what good spirits are supposed to taste like!</strong>  We're making a flavorful, curious gin and a smooth, clean vodka.</p>
<p>We've already proved that we can make really good gin.  Now we want to do it again!  </p>
<p>With your help, we can change the craft spirits industry by making it easier for you to pick up a new craft spirit.</p>
<p>The passion we have for craft spirits pushes us to explore new flavors that provoke an emotion and incite something wonderful.  Our first gin was a huge success!  Pier View Gin is a citrus forward, complex, and delightful gin that won a gold medal in competition.  It really is a fantastic gin, and now we are gearing up for the release of our second style of gin, Tamarack Dry Gin.  Also, by popular demand we will be releasing an incredibly smooth and delicate vodka made from grapes, Sea Gaze Vodka.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542667061/e4ehugkqe5pr1vbpkmub.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Pier View Gin next to the designs for Tamarack Dry Gin, and Sea Gaze Vodka</p>
<p>We have already done test batches of the gin and vodka.  Sea Gaze Vodka is going to be incredible!  Tamarack Dry Gin is going in a different direction than our first gin.  It's going to taste like you stepped into the forest with the scent of pine trees on the fresh crisp cold mountain air.  </p>
<p>As craft distillers we make our vodka and both of our gins in small batches.  By doing this we are able to closely monitor the ""cuts"", and only take the ""hearts"" of the run.  This yields a much smaller amount of finished spirit, but it's worth it.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>But why?</strong></h3>
<p>You might ask, why come out with a second style of gin when you already make a great gin?  To us the answer is simple: we want people to try new new spirits and get immersed in the incredible flavors that only good craft spirits can produce!  We want to normalize the craft spirits industry.  Seems simple enough, right?  Wrong!  For us the producer, and for you the explorer of fine spirits, there are challenges that we must overcome.</p>
<p>Let me explain.</p>
<p>What we have learned in the past year of business is that access to craft spirits is hindered by the way spirits are currently sold.  Currently, you have to invest a large sum of money to purchase a large bottle of ""mystery spirit"" which you might not like.  If you happen to purchase something that you don't like then you are stuck with an expensive bottle that you'll never drink.  That doesn't sound like an acceptable experience.  You'll also be less likely to step out of your comfort zone again.  We've come up with a plan to change the status quo.  When trying a new spirit, 375 ml bottles offer you a smaller, more reasonable investment.  These, half-size bottles can be purchased and consumed quicker and easier than the standard 750ml bottle!  With less waste and an opportunity to try something new, you're much more likely to try new spirits.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>We got creative and put together some really awesome rewards.  Pick one that you like, and your pledge will help us get to the next level!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<u><strong>The Spirits Club</strong></u> - **Exclusively for this campaign**  memberships are good for a lifetime!  If you join now, it will help us complete this project, and we will reward you for a lifetime.  After this campaign, anyone who wants to join the Spirits Club will have to pay quarterly or annual payments.  If you are at all interested I recommend signing up now!  All memberships will be receive a bottle of Pier View Gin after the campaign.</li>
<li>
<u>2 Rocks Glasses</u> - These will be the perfect glassware to sip your new favorite spirit.</li>
<li>
<u>Leather Wrapped Flask Set</u> - This is the ultimate flask, and it is a must have!  It is going to come in a box set with two stainless steel shot glasses.</li>
<li>
<u>Launch Party</u> - We're looking forward to an awesome celebration!  We will have a special cocktail menu using the our three spirits.  Deals on cocktails all night.  You'll have the opportunity to chat with the owners.  Date, time, and location will be disclosed only to those with tickets.  We don't want everyone crashing the party.</li>
<li>
<u>Master Class</u> - If you choose to learn more about the art of making craft spirits our Master Distiller Justin Wilkinson will spend the day teaching you the differences in styles, techniques, and science behind the art!  You'll also get to try different spirits to learn more about the taste.</li>
<li>
<u>Vouchers for spirits</u> are for pick up at The California Spirits Company in San Marcos.</li>
</ul>
<p>A survey will go out after the campaign to gather your information.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The plan</strong></h3>
<p>The plan to bring this dream to life is simple, but it has a lot of moving parts.  There's nothing here that we haven't done before.  We already have relationships with our suppliers, and sample artwork done.  We just need to follow through with the essential purchases, and spend some time sitting by the still.  From there it's all labeling and bottling.</p>
<p>With Justin at the helm of production and The California Spirits Company's guidance we have been able to make the connections and gain the experience we needed to work on fun projects like this.  </p>
<p>Our purchases should be delivered throughout January 2019.  With our bulk goods in house, it doesn't take us long to produce the spirits.  We plan to have made several runs through the still and bottled everything up by the end of February 2019.</p>
<p>To us this is just another day in the life of sharing our art with you.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>How we got here</strong></h3>
<p>We started this business on a shoestring.  Rather than starting with a large sum of money, we used our passion, sweat, and time to get this business started.  Since we made our debut spirit Pier View Gin, we've made a lot of headway into the spirits industry!   We knew that we wanted to keep as much control of the production process as possible, so we found a small, local, craft distillery that would allow us to do just that.  We are eternally grateful to The California Spirits Company for all the help and guidance that has been given to us.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542666994/vvm4a7lxhvltows6ppkr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Since then we have been able to sell Pier View Gin and reinvest the money that we made time and time again to grow our batch sizes and our purchasing power.  We have come a long way, and we are grateful to YOU for loving Pier View Gin as much as we do!  Now it's time for us to take the next step.  Together, we can release another incredible gin and a smooth top shelf vodka (for less than top shelf price). </p>
<p>We came from very humble beginnings, and we worked our butts off because we are believers.  We believe that we are going to help take the craft spirits industry to the next level.  We pooled together our money (just under $3,000) and opened a credit card to put together our first batch of Pier View Gin.  We spent late nights distilling and bottling that first batch; and it was a very small batch!  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542666878/jdwhzbgnbxgvrp3pjtag.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>Our team </h3>
<p>The three of us are in the photo above!</p>
<p><strong>Justin Wilkinson</strong> (left) - Master Distiller.  Justin has been a distiller and manager at The California Spirits Company for over 2 years.  While we all collaborate on every spirit, Justin is the brain; he knows everything there is to know about making great spirits.  His palette and knowledge allows him to bring our vision to life!</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Kohn</strong> (middle) - Director of Sales.  Jordan is now selling Pier View Gin as a full-time job.  Spending time talking to bartenders and customers gives him the opportunity to ask everyone what they really want from craft spirits.  Jordan was formerly a craft brewery sales manager and craft beer distribution sales representative.  He has been in the sales game for the past 10 years.</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Kohn</strong> (right) - Operations.  Ryan has worn a lot of hats in his 5 years at a successful craft brewery in Vista, CA.  From managing a tasting room, to brewer, to inventory manager, he has had the unique privilege of watching a successful craft brewery grow quickly.  He has noted the keys to success along his extensive career path.  Nothing gets past this guy!</p>

<h3>Budget</h3>
<p>Here's a little more detail on the break down of what the funds will be allocated for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ingredients to make the vodka and gin.</li>
<li>A few pallets of bottles (750 ml &amp; 375 ml).  Including boxes.</li>
<li>A lot of labels to go on all these bottles too! Including closures.</li>
<li>We need to pay our designer for the art work he has created.  </li>
<li>We also need funds to turn the ingredients into spirits and then put those spirits into bottles.</li>
<li>We have added funds for risk management in case things go a little over budget.</li>
<li>There will also be fees, of course, and we need to stay on budget so that has been added here too.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542700136/lclyktocc7zqhsbzxoc8.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Since we are already successfully producing Pier View Gin, we have a strong grasp on our process and suppliers.  Risks are a factor in every industry and for us, these risks come in the form of delays.  We can be delayed due to lagging bottle suppliers, or raw goods providers.  We already know that printing our brand-new labels will take the most time.  Our labels require layers of paper and textures to create a unique and identifiable label.  We will work with the same printer that we have been using to minimize lead time, but even when everything looks perfect, the job can still be delayed by acts of god…</p>
<p>For us, making the spirits is the easy part.  It is possible that the rewards will be delayed, but we will make every effort to produce them according to our timeline.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>There are plenty of ways to help us besides pledging money!</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the Indiegogo share tools!  Indiegogo makes it really easy to help.</li>
<li>Tell your friends and family.  Think about people who would be really interested in this.</li>
<li>Share the campaign on your social media.  Tell all your followers how awesome we are, and that they should support us too!</li>

Caraway began as an idea and grew into its first run in the summer of 2014 where we made and sold our very own labeled pints of ice cream. We got a great response from everyone who loved our ice cream flavors.

So no matter how much you contribute, you will receive a sammie along with any of the perks you pick! ~Karen D.Ever had a lick of ice cream that just made you go crazy? Well, that's the kind of ice cream we're trying to make here at Caraway.I thought I knew good ice cream until I made my first homemade ice cream. The greatness of homemade ice cream blew me away and I immediately fell in love. I couldn't go back to those store-bought brands ever again and neither could my family. As soon as people found out that I could make ice cream they started asking me for pints and pints of them. Caraway began as an idea and grew into its first run in the summer of 2014 where we made and sold our very own labeled pints of ice cream. We got a great response from everyone who loved our ice cream flavors. It was a flurry of a run because we had to make and pack so many pints of ice cream in such a short amount of time but it was well worth the effort thanks to all the great people out there who came to help us out.And now, all of our hard work has brought us to this. We’re trying to take another run at it for the Summer of 2015 and make great ice cream again for even more great people. Your contribution will make that happen. We've got our entire line-up of flavors ready, now we just need the extra push to get it going!We’re not asking for an entire ice cream factory. What we need for our second run is just enough money to get it off the ground and up and running. We had a great first run and learned a lot from our successes as well as our mistakes.

TAPP 2 contains about  200g of activated carbon with a surface area of approximately 20 football fields. Activated carbon works via a process called adsorption, whereby pollutant molecules in the fluid to be treated are trapped inside the pore structure of the carbon substrate.</p><p>Over the past 3 years <strong>we’ve tested hundreds of different filters, materials and technologies</strong> to find the best one for tap water. The coconut shell based carbon block that we use is completely organic and has maximum surface area to <strong>filter the water efficiently and quickly fill up a glass of water</strong> or jug. The filter has an on/off switch so that it can be turned on only when filtered water is required.</p><p>The filter <strong>removes over 80 contaminants, effectively reduces another 30 and moderately another 22</strong>. Out of these, the most important are:</p><ul>
<li>Chlorine, which is added to tap water to kill bacteria but also gives it a strong taste and smell</li>
<li>Bi-products (VOCs) from chlorine such as THMs and HAAs that have been identified as cancerous</li>
<li>Pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and petrochemical products</li>
<li>Heavy metals such as lead</li>
</ul><p>The filtering system <strong>does not remove <a href=""https://tappwater.co/en/mineral-water-health-benefits/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">healthy minerals</a> such as magnesium*, calcium*, potassium or iron</strong>, which are in fact important nutrients for our wellbeing. Tap water makes up as much as 1/3 of the daily intake of these minerals. A recent WHO report stated this about demineralized water: <i>“Sufficient evidence is now available to confirm the health consequences from drinking water deficient in calcium or magnesium. Many studies show that higher water magnesium is related to decreased risks for Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) and especially for sudden death from CVD.”</i></p><p><i>*Limescale: considered “hard water”, contains a high amount of minerals that we need in our daily diets, and is not dangerous for human consumption. The problem with hard water is that it causes scale buildup in pipes and water appliances, which can be regulated by cleaning them occasionally with white vinegar</i></p><h3>

TAPP 2 takes 30 seconds to install and fits onto 95% of taps. And better yet, we have created the world's first water filter with fully biodegradable cartridges. Each cartridge lasts about 3 months, and once the cartridge's life is over, just throw it into your compost bin and drink delicious water, knowing that you aren’t polluting our ground-water, rivers, lakes and oceans with plastic waste.  

 At TAPP Water we decided there has to be a better way, so we spent 3 years researching existing water filtering technologies and we came up with TAPP, a revolutionary water filter system for the kitchen tap, delivering clean, fresh tap water in an environmentally friendly way and at a fraction of the cost of bottled water.TAPP 2 is designed by a team of Swedish, German and Spanish product designers in Europe. The filtering technology has been tested extensively in accordance with NSF and EU standards by a EU certified water lab. Final manufacturing is done by our partner in Asia who produce over 10 million water filters of other types per year.  
 

 

 

 

 
   Each cartridge lasts around 900 liters (250 gallons) or 3 months for an average household. The cartridges are easy to replace. Once you’ve used it just dispose of it with the rest of  biocompostable waste and it will biodegrade without leaving a trace of plastic behind.A million plastic bottles are consumed in the world every single minute. The world’s plastic binge is said to be ‘as dangerous as climate change’. Scientists are finding plastic pollution in most fish and seabirds. TAPP 2 is a complete redesign of our successful first product TAPP 1 which is now one of the most popular water filters in Europe.The filtration solution uses a coconut-based carbon block which filters down to 1 micron. Each particle/granule of carbon provides a large surface area/pore structure, allowing contaminants the maximum possible exposure to the active sites within the filter media. TAPP 2 contains about  200g of activated carbon with a surface area of approximately 20 football fields. Activated carbon works via a process called adsorption, whereby pollutant molecules in the fluid to be treated are trapped inside the pore structure of the carbon substrate.Over the past 3 years we’ve tested hundreds of different filters, materials and technologies to find the best one for tap water. The coconut shell based carbon block that we use is completely organic and has maximum surface area to filter the water efficiently and quickly fill up a glass of water or jug. The filter has an on/off switch so that it can be turned on only when filtered water is required.The filter removes over 80 contaminants, effectively reduces another 30 and moderately another 22. Out of these, the most important are:
Chlorine, which is added to tap water to kill bacteria but also gives it a strong taste and smell
Bi-products (VOCs) from chlorine such as THMs and HAAs that have been identified as cancerous
Pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and petrochemical products
Heavy metals such as lead
The filtering system does not remove healthy minerals such as magnesium*, calcium*, potassium or iron, which are in fact important nutrients for our wellbeing. Tap water makes up as much as 1/3 of the daily intake of these minerals. A recent WHO report stated this about demineralized water: “Sufficient evidence is now available to confirm the health consequences from drinking water deficient in calcium or magnesium. Many studies show that higher water magnesium is related to decreased risks for Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) and especially for sudden death from CVD.”*Limescale: considered “hard water”, contains a high amount of minerals that we need in our daily diets, and is not dangerous for human consumption. The problem with hard water is that it causes scale buildup in pipes and water appliances, which can be regulated by cleaning them occasionally with white vinegar

The filter is made up of 3 parts:

Filter: Attaches to the faucet and includes an on/off switch for filtered vs unfiltered water. This main unit is made of BPA-free ABS plastic and lasts over 5 years.

Cartridge: Made up from a coconut based carbon block surrounded by PLA plastic (plant based biodegradable) that can be disposed with compostables and breaks down within 1-3 months in adequate conditions.

Bluetooth® unit: Connects the filter to your smartphone for easy monitoring of the cartridge usage and when it needs to be replaced. 
  The MyTAPP app and website keeps track of your filter usage, prompting you when the cartridge needs to be replaced. It also helps you visualize your cost savings, plastic bottles avoided, CO2 footprint reduction and more. MyTAPP allows each household to configure estimated lifespan of the filter based on household members and frequency of use. The app allows the user to reorder cartridges or configure the yearly subscription option for heavy users.  Bluetooth® button:You can simply click the button at any time and the MyTAPP app will pop up on your phone and tell you how much time is left of the filter. It will also warn and notify you when it's time to change the filter. The Bluetooth® only activates / emits a signal once you press the button, so it won't be connected all the time, only at your convenience.The battery will last approximately 3 years with regular use.

<h3>Our Plan:</h3>
<p>Just over four years ago we, Ron Gomes and Mike Rasmussen, opened Painted Stave Distilling in downtown Smyrna, Delaware.  We started with a dilapidated old movie theater and in time have turned it into a premier destination in Smyrna for great spirits and great cocktails.  It has been an amazing amount of hard work and fun along the way, and we have come to a place where we want and need to grow the business so it can be the wonderful place we want for our community.</p>
<p>To accomplish that, in the last year we have purchased the building and surrounding lots, and are working to expand our footprint on both the production/distillery side as well as on the Craft Cocktail side.  A key part of our expansion includes building a great outdoor space on the west side of our building, what we call our Craft Cocktail Garden.  We envision a space where our community of friends and supporters can come together and enjoy great drinks along with art, music, and other community events.  With your support, we can raise these funds and transform what is now an empty lot into one of the coolest outdoor spaces in the region.</p>
<h3>We Need Your Help:</h3>
<p>To make this space a reality, we need your help.  The cost to build out space we dream of and meet all of the state and local codes along the way will be about $50,000.  That money will pay for things we need, like:</p>
</div><div>
<ul>
<li><p>A patio area along with tables, chairs, firepits, and sunshades so that our friends have a nice place to sit ($20,000)</p></li>
<li><p>A fence for the garden that includes ADA/Emergency gates as well as landscaping to provide a visual barrier for our neighbors we are located right next to a Church!) ($13,000)</p></li>
<li><p>A paved space so food trucks have a place to park and the power they need to run safely and with no noisy generators! ($3,000)</p></li>
<li><p>A stage that can be used for music and art performances ($2,000)</p></li>
<li><p>An expanded utility area with a fence to hide our water tanks and chiller ($4,000)</p></li>
<li><p>Grass and other landscaping, including an irrigation system to keep it all alive ($5,000)</p></li>
<li>An ADA access door into the existing tasting/cocktail bar ($3,000)</li>
</ul>
<p>In exchange for your support in building the Craft Cocktail garden, we have come up with a bunch of great perks.  These start off with some fun swag and bottles of spirits and work their way up to great private classes, dinners, lots of beverages and even the chance to get your name tattooed on Mike's butt (some restrictions apply)!  We are planning what is sure to be a great garden party to kick off the opening of the space, surely something you don't want to miss.</p>
<p>The more money we bring in during the campaign, the more of this we will be able to add to the garden.  We need to complete the required pieces first (fences, access doors, etc.) and then we will focus on the things that will make the Craft Cocktail Garden an awesome location right in the center of our town.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Park’s Place will provide a locally sourced, high-quality dining experience to the residents of Athens County Ohio and the surrounding areas to create a community that is more sustainable and cooperative.</p>
<p>Owned by Cory Richards &amp; Josh Vernon, Park’s Place will make community advancement and superior quality its primary focus. Its investment and commitment to the local economy of Athens County and surrounding areas, and the people who support it, will be held above all else. Park’s Place will offer dine-in, take-out and large party accommodations and strive to be environmentally responsible. Due to these core values and diverse offerings, Park’s Place will be a premier locally supplied restaurant in Athens County.</p>
<p>About the Owner's:</p>
<ul><li>Cory Richards – Cory grew up in Barlow, Ohio and during his childhood would spend his summers in Amesville on his grandparent’s farm. Cory developed a passion for cooking at a very young age which has evolved into a fanatical hobby in his adult years. Since then, Cory has catered food for weddings and events, cooked as a sous chef for 5 course wine dinners, and finds any reason to make people happy through good food. Supporting local farmers and creating food with local ingredients is very important to him.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Josh Vernon – Josh is a 5th generation Amesville resident. He has countless childhood memories of helping his family on their farm located on Sand Rock Road where he now lives. He has ten years of experience in customer service and a bachelor’s degree in Animal Science. When he’s not busy with his ‘day job’, he enjoys helping out in the local community by volunteering for the Amesville Fire Department, the Athens County Junior Fair Sale Committee and many other community events.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul><li>Park's Place doesn't just want a hand-out, we want you to want to support this venture and for doing so you will be rewarded with awesome perks! The reward structure is tiered and each tier builds off the previous so the more you donate the more you get in return (besides just an awesome farm-to-table restaurant ran by two groovy dudes). At the mid-range level ($200) you receive a coupon for a free dessert, a Park's Place decal, Park's Place t-shirt, a coupon for 15% off all orders for the first six months of operations and a ticket for you and a guest to attend a private dinner event scheduled for July 13th 2019.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Park's Place is hoping to raise $20,000 to help with start-up costs. Start-up costs include the following:<ul>
<li>Two weeks of operating costs (food, wages, etc.)</li>
<li>Two events (a private dinner event July 13th 2019 and family / friends soft opening July 14th 2019)</li>
<li>All the small things (plates, silverware, cups, bowls, pots, pans, napkins, etc.)</li>
<li>All the big things (furniture, fixtures, equipment and point of sales system)</li>
<li>Renovations to the existing space<ul>
<li>Updated bathrooms &amp; dining area</li>
<li>Mix of farmhouse &amp; industrial concepts</li>
<li>Family &amp; community oriented</li>
<li>Bright, warm &amp; welcoming</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>Even if Park's Place doesn't reach their goal of $20,000 the funds will still go towards the previously mentioned items. Whatever we don't raise we will have to sell our houses to finance (just kidding, maybe just an arm and a leg).<ul></ul>

<p>Peace and Love. My name is Charita Pressey. I go by the name ""Afua Nsowaa""  I am a Plant based Chef, Writer, and Holistic Healer. I have had a strong passion for cooking ever since I was a young girl. Growing up in foster care I was not afforded many opportunities to practice and master my craft. Once I became an adult I set out to do what I have always yearned to do. In 2013  I started Angie's Catering Company in memory of my mother. Fortunately for me, not long after I began a healthy lifestyle change and gave birth to Love, Light, and Alkaline Eatery. Love, Light, and Alkaline Eatery is a plant based meal prep and mobile vending company currently based out of Jacksonville Fl. Since 2014 I have serviced over 1,000 clients and attended many successful vending events. My mission is to aid the community in healing thru the art of food, act of love, and wisdom of light. It is important for me to share my story of how I overcame poor health and depression by simply changing what I put into my body by way of food, actions, and words. My goal is to birth an alkaline vegan food truck and spread my message throughout the world. As a contributor you will not only help me achieve this goal but you will also help bring flavor, diversity, and a whole lot of love to the vegan community of Jacksonville FL.</p>
<p>I am starting from scratch and will need a new or custom made food truck which cost anywhere from 50-60 k</p>
<p>My focus is to make a major impact on the community. It is my hopes that thru my food truck I will motivate, inspire, and empower others to eat an animal free/ cruelty free diet. That in itself will be a major catalyst for world peace and change.</p>

<p>After 8 years of chocolate making in two countries, on opposite ends of the world, Metiisto is ready to expand production. </p>

<p>Metiisto started life as a pioneer of the Swedish Craft chocolate movement back in 2012. We sourced  the worlds finest cocoas and lovingly crafted it into silky smooth chocolate that went on to win us four silver medals at the Academy of Chocolate Awards in 2016.</p>
<p>In 2018,  Metiisto was moved to Toowoomba, Australia. This time around, we wanted to help make a change in the chocolate industry by finding cocoa, that was closer to Australia and something with big potential. When we tested samples of cocoa from the Solomon Islands we knew this was what we wanted to do.</p>
<p>Our first bars won 3 gold medals at the RASV Australian Food Awards three months after opening, and in 2019 we took that up to 5 golds, 3 silvers, Best in Class and won the the 'Best Australian Small Producer' trophy. We also took home a gold and the prized 'International Rising Star' trophy at the Academy of Chocolate Awards the same year.</p>

<p>To meet the ever growing demand for our award winning chocolate and chocolate based products we need to upgrade our machines. These machines are needed for us to make larger batches of chocolate and produce more of our amazing chocolate covered nuts and flavored bars.</p>

<p><u>What we need</u></p>
<p>A chocolate factory needs many specialized machines. Most of our current machines are home made, heavily modified and re purposed from other industries. We have gotten this far on our own, but now we need help to take it to the next level.</p>
<p>We are looking for funding for two main things: A new panning machine and cocoa inventory.</p>
<p>A large panning machine will give us the ability to finally launch a range of chocolate covered nuts, fruits and even crispy centers. We have faced many hurdles with keeping enough cocoa beans and cocoa butter in stock at all times and would love to buy in at least a few tons of cocoa. Any additional money, that can be raised will be put into buying more cocoa and electrical upgrades to the factory for the new machines.</p>

<p>We have secured leasing for the largest machine we need for the making of larger batches of chocolate, the additional machine and supply of cocoa will help us make more of yummy chocolate and chocolate products.</p>
<p>Metiisto is dedicated to transparency in the cocoa industry. By supporting us you are supporting the hard work of the cocoa farmers in the Solomon Islands, that make this all possible. We are only a small family owned and operated business, that is only a drop in the ocean compared to the big players in this industry, but all big things start small and we have big dreams and the know how to make a positive difference in the chocolate industry.</p>

<p>After 25 years of marriage, two kids, years of working in restaurants, bakeries, schools, and clubs, what's next?</p>
<p>Opening our own place. The Bard's Bounty, located on the Lacey-Olympia border, will feature great food, live acoustic music, and RPG/tabletop gaming. Amy is a cook whose resume includes The Biltmore Estate and Anthony's, along with a decade of food service and kitchen management. Joel is a musician and gamer who has booked, mixed, and run music venues in Denver and Seattle. </p>
<p>So why Indiegogo?</p>
<p>Along with having a lot of experience in these kinds of places, we've both done our homework. Times ten. We know that however much runway cash you think you've got, assume you need more. Licenses, equipment rentals, signage, repairs, insurance, there's no end to it. Not to mention the fact that when we finally went public with our grand plan, we had friend after friend coming up to us and asking if we were looking for investors. Well, the short answer was 'no'. This was not something we were designing to scale up and give investors a 10x return on their money. We were just looking to create a great acoustic music and game venue with tasty food.  ""That's all we want,"" they said. ""We know Amy's an amazing chef, and if there's a way we can help you get off the ground, and maybe have a few free beers whenever we're in Olympia, it's a win-win!""</p>
<p>That made sense to us. So we've decided to open The Bard's Bounty up to contributions with some fun perks, purchases and gifts thrown in. Take advantage if you feel so inclined. Whether you do or not, you'll always have a table waiting near the stage. Pull a guitar off the wall, come on up and teach us a tune. </p>

<p><strong>Was ist WASTED?</strong></p>
<p>WASTED ist Weltverbesserung, die man trinken kann. </p>
<p>Laut der Welternährungsorganisation FAO landet ein Drittel aller weltweit produzierten Lebensmittel im Müll. In Wien wird jeden Tag soviel Brot weggeworfen, wie Graz am Tag isst. Wir von WASTED finden, Brot gehört gegessen, oder in unserem Fall getrunken, und nicht auf den Müll! </p>
<p>Unsere ersten 2 Biersorten sind KORNSPITZ – Cream Ale und SEMMEL – Lager. Die Brotaromen verleihen dem Bier einen unvergleichlichen Geschmack. Da kann man schon mal mit gutem Gewissen einen über den Durst trinken. </p>
<p>Wir brauchen eure Unterstützung, um unsere WASTED-Prototypen zu finanzieren, zu vermarkten, um noch mehr Brot vor der Tonne zu retten, und um weitere Brauexperimente zu starten.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Wer sind wir?</strong></p>
<p>Hinter WASTED stehen die WASTEBOYS:<br/>Tobias Judmaier: Zerowaste-Unternehmer und Gründer von Iss mich! <br/>Mit seinem Bio-Catering verkocht er in Wien Gemüse, das für den Handel zu krumm ist.</p>
<p>David Gross: Filmemacher, Mülltaucher und Gründer von WASTECOOKING. Mit seiner konsumkritischen Kochshow kocht er inzwischen weltweit gegen Verschwendung auf. </p>
<p>Für die ersten 2 WASTED-Prototypen haben die WASTEBOYS den Braumeister Rainer Mraz von der Bierstarter-Brauerei ins Boot geholt. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Welche Geschichte steckt dahinter?</strong></p>
<p>Die Kunst aus Brot Bier zu brauen ist so alt wie die Kulturgeschichte der Menschheit. Schon die alten Ägypter und Babylonier nutzten hart gewordenes Brot, um ein URBIER herzustellen. Braumeister aus Belgien und aus England haben diese Kunst in den letzten Jahren wieder aufgegriffen. Der WASTED-Ansatz, Bier aus unverkauftem Biobrot zu brauen, ist aber bisher einzigartig. Das Waste-Brot wird im Braukessel zu frischem Quellwasser, Hefe, Hopfen und Gerstenmalz zugefügt. Es ersetzt bis zu einem Drittel des Braumalzes und wird im Brauprozeß zu vergärbarem Zucker umgewandelt.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Was haben wir mit dem Geld vor? </strong></p>
<p>Mit den 15.000 Euro wollen wir einen Teil unserer Startkosten für das Projekt abdecken.</p>
<p>Dazu zählen:</p>
<ul>

<p><strong>Warum WASTED?</strong></p>
<p>In einer Welt der begrenzten Ressourcen, ist der Kampf gegen Lebensmittelverschwendung ein Gebot der Stunde. Die WASTEBOYS haben mit ihren Vorgängerprojekten bewiesen, dass ihnen Nachhaltigkeit im Lebensmittelbereich ein wirkliches Anliegen sind. WASTED zeigt das Problem der Brotverschwendung auf und liefert den genussvollen Lösungsansatz gleich mit dazu. Die bessere Welt kann verdammt gut schmecken. Lasst uns gemeinsam darauf anstossen! Let’s get wasted for a better world!</p>
</div></div>","Was ist WASTED?
WASTED ist Weltverbesserung, die man trinken kann. 
Laut der Welternährungsorganisation FAO landet ein Drittel aller weltweit produzierten Lebensmittel im Müll. In Wien wird jeden Tag soviel Brot weggeworfen, wie Graz am Tag isst. Wir von WASTED finden, Brot gehört gegessen, oder in unserem Fall getrunken, und nicht auf den Müll!

<h3>The Short Summary: I was born to JAM</h3>
<p>The long answer lies in those moments when you taste something so delicious that you instinctually pause the moment it hits your tastebuds.  Those moments when that flavor passes right through your tongue directly into your soul, making your eyes roll into the back of your head. Making you inhale immediately and deeply, only to let it out a slow, satisfied sigh as the corners of your mouth turn upward into a smile. Those are the moments I live for. And those are the moments I jam for.</p>
<p>Creating That’s My Jam is a calling home for me in many ways. I’ve always enjoyed farming, fresh produce, and making delicious food to share with people, and that’s exactly what That’s My Jam is all about. I grew up in rural Pennsylvania both farming and preserving food since before I can remember.  I moved to New York City over six years ago and while my farming and preserving was put on hold, I was exposed to new cuisines and complex layering of flavors that have made their way into my jams.</p>
<p>It was a happy accident that I got back into making jams. One summer when I was about to head out to a berry patch to pick, I realized I had a few jars of jam from the previous year that I was never going to finish them myself. I shared them with others, and everyone raved about them, saying it was the best jam they've ever tasted because it wasn't overly sweet and the flavor of the fruit was the star. At the time I was working at an Afternoon Tea Salon on the Lower East Side, and the owner said I should make jam to be served with tea. Before I knew it, I had a small jam business growing and That's My Jam was born.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>We're looking to raise $1500, which will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>That's My Farm, a berry garden that will provide all the delicious fruit once it's reached maturity</li>
<li>Jars, Labels, Pectin, Website fees</li>
<li>Legal fees to be able to sell online rather than just farmer's markets</li>
</ul>
<p>Non-Monetary ways you can help, which are equally as helpful:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introductions to owners of farmer's market stands who would be interested in selling my jam</li>
<li>Donate your overabundance of fruit from the tree in your back yard if you have one</li>
<li>
<strong>TO TRY IT!</strong> Seriously. I need you to know how amazing this stuff is.</li>
<li>Share this campaigns with your friends.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Jam, which equals infinite pleasure and happiness</li>
<li>To have a positive impact on the Earth by supporting a woman whose main goal is to take care of Mother Earth through sustainable farming practices and beekeeping (read The Impact for more info)</li>
<li>ALL THE GLORY</li>
<li>infinite thanks and gratitude, as well as a special place in my heart</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In addition to spreading pleasure and happiness, you will also be supporting local agriculture and earth-friendly farming processes. </p>
<p>While experimenting with jam recipes and flavor combinations, I learned that the secret to exquisite jams is to use exquisite fruit. There’s nothing like a fresh berry picked at peak ripeness. No matter how hard a person tries, they can’t recreate the perfection Mother Nature has already produced. That’s why I never try to outsmart her. I simply let her be my inspiration and guide. I simply want to showcase her beauty through jam.</p>
<p>With this realization, I saw an opportunity for That’s My Jam to not only be about creating mouth-watering jams, but also to use it as a platform to learn more about and implement earth-friendly farming practices and eventually beekeeping and composting. Mother Earth needs people caring for her more than ever, so the heart of That’s My Jam is to be a spokesperson for Mother Earth through sharing how to care for the planet and also showcasing her beauty through exquisitely crafted jams.  These two things combined created my vision for the growth of That’s My Jam. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Really there are none. I'm going to keep doing this no matter what, but it would certainly be easier if you helped out.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Mon Macaron started with a Kitchenaid Mixer and a dream. Two moms (Autumn and Brittany) started this company and operate every aspect of it while balancing motherhood with six kids between their families. In five short months, Mon Macaron has grown exponentially and introduced a unique and sensational new offering: hand airbrushed corporate logo macarons.</p>
<p>With this new technique, Mon Macaron has taken on corporate clients for gifts and events! Our hope is to expand this portion of our business as edible branding is a popular and fun way to show off a company logo or brand.</p>
<p>We have no background in pastry nor are we chefs or attended pasty school. We are 100% self-taught and perfected this advanced technique of macaron making. Old fashioned hard work and perseverance has allowed us to double and then triple sales, ending 2019 with five-figure sales accomplishments! </p>
<p>The reason for this campaign is spreading the love of macarons with nationwide shipping and reaching our local communities with a retail location. Funding from this campaign will help us achieve both of those goals with 1) new equipment that allows us to create, store, and decorate macarons and 2) fund build-out and equipment costs for our first micro-retail location in Raleigh-Durham.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are asking for help with $500 or more of our expenses. This will go directly to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our first month of rent at our micro-retail location in Raleigh-Durham</li>
<li><p>Avantco BCC-48-HC 48"" White Refrigerated Countertop Bakery Display Case with LED Lighting</p></li>
<li><p>The Ink Edibles CakePro 750a</p></li>
<li><p>Bakon USA DropTT Depositor</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For believing in us as a backer for this campaign you will receive, dependant on the amount pledged:</p>
<ul>
<li>A dozen of our most popular macaron flavors shipped to you</li>
<li>A subscription for a monthly surprise macaron box</li>
<li>A professional image of Mon Macarons to print or use as a background</li>
<li>Our love and appreciation</li>
<li>A macaron on us when we open our first location!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact of helping us at this critical time in our small business venture is believing in small businesses, handcrafted products, small-batch delicious baked goods, and most importantly the two moms who opened this business to teach our kids the value of hard work and dedication.</p>
<p>The community will be impacted by a macaron business because it will help the local economy and employ countless others in the community. We plan to partner with local pasty programs and community college foodservice programs to employ young people ready to learn a new skill.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As two previously stay-at-home moms, we did not start this business with any funding or loans. We are a 100% cash positive business and have organically grown our sales to several thousand per month as a brand new business starting in August 2019. We built this company on our own with minimal overhead and the challenge with growth is that we have to find creative ways to fund expansion. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute financially, please share our story and our macarons! </p>

<p>Thank you for believing in us and this business! Here's to an amazing 2020! </p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">​sol &amp; NOVA </h2>
<p>sol &amp; NOVA LLC is founded by Vern Kittler and Natalie Meiselwitz. Vern has been a tattoo artist for the past 10+ years and is a manager of Greenseed Studios located in Sheboygan. Natalie is currently the sous chef at BoMallies here in Sheboygan. Vern and Natalie decided that creating sol &amp; NOVA together would be a way to combine two worlds into one business. Natalie will provide food and drink service during the day hours of sol &amp; NOVA and Vern will use his years of experience playing music and creating art to make a music venue at night. sol &amp; NOVA will also be a safe haven for artists in our community; we want to offer a place for local artists to come and create or to sell their art/products. We want sol &amp; NOVA to become a local hub for artists, musicians, and any and everyone who enjoys the fine arts. </p>
<p>sol &amp; NOVA LLC is an innovative, artistic, inviting, and safe cafe that turns into an 21+ music-based nightclub located straight in the center of the City of Sheboygan. We plan to entice and quite frankly shock Sheboygan with offering them an experience that is quite unfamiliar and entirely unique to the area. Sheboygan is encompassed with bars and with an entire drinking lifestyle and we plan to break that cycle by supplying something new. Sol” the cafe portion of sol &amp; NOVA will offer alcohol free drinks such as specialty cold brews, coffees, teas, kombucha, and a variety of other drink options. The cafe will include an innovative and modern approach on classic cafe foods, we aim to offer variety while still having an approachable menu. The goal of “sol” is to provide our customers with natural, organic, sustainable, and locally sourced products at an affordable price. We are going to bring an accessibility to organic, local produce that Sheboygan has yet to see from other local cafes and restaurants, all while doing it in an inventive, creative, and ultimately flavorful way. What will truly set sol &amp; NOVA apart from other local hotspots will be the fact that our brand of entertainment will be solely focused on the talent of the musicians we bring in and the ambient environment we tend to create. We aspire to combine two worlds by having “sol” be a relaxed cafe, a very chill environment during the days conducive to business meetings or students studying; then flipping the switch and becoming an 21+ nightclub, “NOVA”, offering live music and an environment that won’t be solely focused on alcohol in order to have a good night. NOVA will provide a nightlife experience to Sheboygan that this city has yet to ever witness. We will have a perfectly tuned and large Personal Audio system equipped with Martin subwoofers, a choreographed visual, lighting, and laser experience in an ambient atmosphere. </p> <p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What We Need and What You Get </strong></p>
<p>For our project, we are completing a series of large renovations in the space. One of the largest expenses in our budget is the electrical for the building, being an expense around $20,000 alone. We are doing a complete overhaul of the outdoor space, providing ample outdoor seating, really</p>
<p>giving the space the curb appeal that it currently lacks, and updating and securing the property line with a multifunctional barrier wall and outdoor bar top. We aim to create an outdoor space that we can utilize as many months of the year as possible with added outdoor heaters. Outdoor renovations are projected to cost around $7,500. From there, we move into the indoor space. The space inside will be getting a fresh coat of paint and will have a custom built stage that encompasses six Martin Subwoofers. The stage will also be multifunctional, so when it is not a stage, it will hold a display case for various bakery items and pre-packaged foods for patrons on-the-go. The cafe will be equipped with an espresso machine, drip coffee machines and warmers, juicers, ice machine, hot water heater, ect. Projected indoor costs will be around $15,000. The space also has the potential for a kitchen in an adjoining room that will have a cut out/walkway into the main dining space. All projected kitchen equipment and installation costs will be around $25,000. All together our budget for this project will be around $67,500. With that being said, we are reaching out to the community for support and for a contribution into a business that plans to better our city. We want to bring life back to a place that sits on one of the busiest streets filled with small businesses and with a reputation for a nightlife. We want the people in our city to be a part of this project, because we are ultimately doing it for all of you. We are asking for support so we are able to open the best version of sol &amp; NOVA that we can envision; and by contributing, you are helping us open our doors.

<h3>Us, Beer, And The World</h3>
<p>We are Alex and Kelsey Watley, a husband and wife team that started brewing beer together in the very early stages of our relationship. In an odd way, we've found that beer is an integral part of our lives; We make it, we search for it, and it's there for some of our best memories with friends. Chances are, if you're here, you feel similar. </p>
<p>We want to taste the best beer brewers in this country have to offer, and we want to share those experiences with people that appreciate good beer. What better way to do that than a subscription box?</p>
<p>Treat yourself to a very competitively priced, private Craft Beer Club, that will send a minimum of 72ozs of beer- a variety of tastes from independent breweries- right to your door. We'll also occasionally throw in little gifts, because we like it when you're happy. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Help Us Help You</h3>
<p>We are looking for $10,000, which will go towards two primary things: licensing and, well, beer. Licensing is important because it allows us to access the best beers and deliver them right to you, unhindered. The money will cover the licensing fee in our birth place, Washington D.C. as well as the shipping licenses that some states require. The rest will cover the fun stuff, beer, as well as the unique beer accessories that we'll be featuring in some of our Rebel Boxes.</p>
<p>Money is not the only thing we need though. YOU are our most important asset. This campaign is the ONLY place to get the first 100 subscriptions that we're releasing. We call the club private because we can only open up a few member slots at a time. Open, fluid membership would mean large amounts of inventory on hand, which tends to lead to flat or stale beer. To make sure that the beer that comes to you is fresh and as close to tap room quality as possible, we keep our membership limited. So, right here, on Indiegogo, is the ONLY place to get the first 100 membership slots available. Remember- members also get discounts at our online bottle shop, which will hold rare, high end craft beer that comes in only the smallest quantities.  </p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, all is not lost! Our priority will still be licensing, but we've made sure that we'll have the money to cover every single member that wants a piece of this delicious beer pie. Again, YOU are really what we're looking for; People to create a craft beer connection with, so the entire country can be a giant, local, craft beer community. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Tap Rebellion</h3>
<p>So why is this a rebellion? Well, I won't go too far into the boring stuff, but essentially, the liquor laws in this country are leftover from prohibition. No, not entirely. Obviously alcohol is legal now, but is that all we should be happy about? Big Beer- corporate beer- controls the laws that govern breweries, and Craft beer is getting big! This means that a lot of micro-breweries get swallowed up, or even bullied out of existence. We want to help these Micro-Breweries get connected with people all over the country that may never have even heard about them! We want to get these independent crafters exposed to potential new fans! They've already rebelled by standing in the face of the giant corporate beer companies and saying they've had enough of bland, watery, beer. We just want to fuel the fire of the rebellion, and help you join too!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges; Or, Are We Bootleggers?</h3>
<p>There are two main challenges that we have foreseen. One is shipping. Some states are a fun party-time free for all (yay Florida!) and there will be no problems getting beer to them. Others aren't quite so awesome, and we'll need to go through the proper channels to get shipping licenses from them. And others, well, they just flat out say no (boo Utah!). For those of you in the 'boo' states, we are very sorry, there's nothing we can do for you, and we really don't want to get shut down, fined, or thrown in prison. Our doughy beer physiques can't handle it. The good news is, laws change all the time! We're constantly monitoring the laws and we'll let you know IMMEDIATELY when we can open up membership to you.</p>
<p><strong>States We CANNOT Ship To:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Arkansas</li>
<li>Alabama</li>
<li>Illinois</li>
<li>Indiana</li>
<li>Kentucky</li>
<li>Maine</li>
<li>Massachusetts</li>
<li>Maryland</li>
<li>Michigan</li>
<li>Minnesota</li>
<li>Missouri</li>
<li>New Jersey</li>
<li>New York</li>
<li>New Mexico</li>
<li>Oklahoma</li>
<li>Rhode Island</li>
<li>South Dakota</li>
<li>Tennessee</li>
<li>Texas</li>
<li>Utah</li>
<li>Washington</li>
</ul>
<p>For everyone else- kanpai! </p>
<p>The second challenge is the breweries themselves. The very nature of nano and micro-breweries is that they don't distribute very much. Some do, and we can easily find them in very small, local wholesalers to get them out to you. Some even distribute for themselves, and we can grab a few hundred bottles, cans, or crowlers directly from their tap room. Others, well...they don't distribute at all. They've got kegs, taps, and growler fill ups, but often no way to bottle or can. But we still want relationships with these breweries! That's why one of our plans, if we get over our fundraising goals, is to invest in a canning machine. That way, even if it's just for limited runs, we can help these smaller (but equally delicious) breweries get the exposure they deserve.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute, fear not! There are still ways to help the rebellion. You can follow us on social media (@taprebels), you can tell all your beer lovin' friends about us, you can keep us in mind for gifts and special occasions, and you can share this campaign with everyone you know! </p>
<p> The best way you can help us? Nominate your favorite breweries to us! Go to <a href=""http://www.taprebels.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.taprebels.com</a> and put some names in the Suggestion Box. I'm sure your favorite breweries would love to hear that you're thinking about them ;)</p>
</div></div>","Us, Beer, And The World
We are Alex and Kelsey Watley, a husband and wife team that started brewing beer together in the very early stages of our relationship. In an odd way, we've found that beer is an integral part of our lives; We make it, we search for it, and it's there for some of our best memories with friends. Chances are, if you're here, you feel similar. 
We want to taste the best beer brewers in this country have to offer, and we want to share those experiences with people that appreciate good beer. What better way to do that than a subscription box?
Treat yourself to a very competitively priced, private Craft Beer Club, that will send a minimum of 72ozs of beer- a variety of tastes from independent breweries- right to your door. We'll also occasionally throw in little gifts, because we like it when you're happy. 

Help Us Help You
We are looking for $10,000, which will go towards two primary things: licensing and, well, beer. Licensing is important because it allows us to access the best beers and deliver them right to you, unhindered. The money will cover the licensing fee in our birth place, Washington D.C. as well as the shipping licenses that some states require. The rest will cover the fun stuff, beer, as well as the unique beer accessories that we'll be featuring in some of our Rebel Boxes.
Money is not the only thing we need though. YOU are our most important asset. This campaign is the ONLY place to get the first 100 subscriptions that we're releasing. We call the club private because we can only open up a few member slots at a time. Open, fluid membership would mean large amounts of inventory on hand, which tends to lead to flat or stale beer. To make sure that the beer that comes to you is fresh and as close to tap room quality as possible, we keep our membership limited. So, right here, on Indiegogo, is the ONLY place to get the first 100 membership slots available. Remember- members also get discounts at our online bottle shop, which will hold rare, high end craft beer that comes in only the smallest quantities.  
If we don't reach our goal, all is not lost! Our priority will still be licensing, but we've made sure that we'll have the money to cover every single member that wants a piece of this delicious beer pie. Again, YOU are really what we're looking for; People to create a craft beer connection with, so the entire country can be a giant, local, craft beer community. 

The Tap Rebellion
So why is this a rebellion? Well, I won't go too far into the boring stuff, but essentially, the liquor laws in this country are leftover from prohibition. No, not entirely. Obviously alcohol is legal now, but is that all we should be happy about? Big Beer- corporate beer- controls the laws that govern breweries, and Craft beer is getting big! This means that a lot of micro-breweries get swallowed up, or even bullied out of existence. We want to help these Micro-Breweries get connected with people all over the country that may never have even heard about them! We want to get these independent crafters exposed to potential new fans! They've already rebelled by standing in the face of the giant corporate beer companies and saying they've had enough of bland, watery, beer. We just want to fuel the fire of the rebellion, and help you join too!

Challenges; Or, Are We Bootleggers?
There are two main challenges that we have foreseen. One is shipping. Some states are a fun party-time free for all (yay Florida!) and there will be no problems getting beer to them. Others aren't quite so awesome, and we'll need to go through the proper channels to get shipping licenses from them. And others, well, they just flat out say no (boo Utah!). For those of you in the 'boo' states, we are very sorry, there's nothing we can do for you, and we really don't want to get shut down, fined, or thrown in prison. Our doughy beer physiques can't handle it. The good news is, laws change all the time! We're constantly monitoring the laws and we'll let you know IMMEDIATELY when we can open up membership to you.
States We CANNOT Ship To:

Arkansas
Alabama
Illinois
Indiana
Kentucky
Maine
Massachusetts
Maryland
Michigan
Minnesota
Missouri
New Jersey
New York
New Mexico
Oklahoma
Rhode Island
South Dakota
Tennessee
Texas
Utah
Washington

For everyone else- kanpai! 
The second challenge is the breweries themselves. The very nature of nano and micro-breweries is that they don't distribute very much. Some do, and we can easily find them in very small, local wholesalers to get them out to you. Some even distribute for themselves, and we can grab a few hundred bottles, cans, or crowlers directly from their tap room. Others, well...they don't distribute at all. They've got kegs, taps, and growler fill ups, but often no way to bottle or can. But we still want relationships with these breweries! That's why one of our plans, if we get over our fundraising goals, is to invest in a canning machine. That way, even if it's just for limited runs, we can help these smaller (but equally delicious) breweries get the exposure they deserve.
 

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute, fear not! There are still ways to help the rebellion. You can follow us on social media (@taprebels), you can tell all your beer lovin' friends about us, you can keep us in mind for gifts and special occasions, and you can share this campaign with everyone you know! 
 The best way you can help us? Nominate your favorite breweries to us! Go to www.taprebels.com and put some names in the Suggestion Box. I'm sure your favorite breweries would love to hear that you're thinking about them ;)",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>How We Came to Be</strong></h3>
<p>I grew up in the Chicago and southern Wisconsin area with great cheesecake. I learned to bake when I was just 4 years old. As a young girl, I spent time in 3rd world countries and upon returning to the USA I knew that one day I wanted a life of giving back. I started Muddy Paws Cheesecake in 1992. 26 years later, we are still in business in the same city where I started it: St Louis Park, Minnesota! We make 222 flavors of cheesecake and we do work with many local charities. Each year we also put on cheesecake sampling event which brings in hundreds of toys and pounds of food for our charity partners: Step Emergency Program &amp; Perspectives Family. Last year, we were an accidental target of a burglary which damaged most of our bakery. The public came thru to help us rebuild! To give them a better place to come to and to put that experience behind us, we moved to a new location mid-January 2019.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To be able to bake, we must contract a licensed professional to install a gas line &amp; hook up for our oven. We are borrowing an electric oven (once our sinks are put in!), which has limited capacity. Our gas oven, once hooked up, will allow us to bake in the volume needed to be able to keep up with production. We are also wanting to create a community space for gatherings, meetings and co-working! This is a needed affordable option in our community and it will be offered at a discounted rate to our cheesecake customers. We need help with costs of that remodeling. </p>
<p>The Indiegogo funds will be broken down accordingly:</p>
<p>$3,000 for Gas Install/Hook Up</p>
<p>$5,000 for Community Space (paint/carpet/furniture)</p>
<p>Any extra funds will go towards helping pay back the loan taken out to cover expenses of the moving truck + expenses paid for paint/flooring/furniture/ceiling tiles/signage/marketing materials and lighting in our retail area (which is done!).</p>
<p>What you will get is your name on a wall plaque in the community meeting space, which will be the We Built This Cheesecake wall! You will also get to attend a private party just for our investors, where will have cheesecake, live music and some surprise perks handed out! All who donate over $40, will get a ""We Built This Cheesecake"" T-Shirt! (You may buy a t-shirt or extra t-shirts, at cost, as well. Link will be provided here soon.)</p>
<p>*The celebration party will be early April, 2019.</p>

<h3>Sovda was launched just 6 months ago here on Indiegogo.</h3>
<p>We are so thankful for all the support and how the Specialty coffee industry has supported our first product.  </p>
<p>Our most requested item from our Pearl Mini Customers was a </p>
<ul>
<li>Destoner that didn’t take up so much space</li>
<li>Dust elimination</li>
<li>Adjustable hopper </li>
<li>Stainless steel loader </li>
</ul>
<p>That is the challenge we gave our design team and the result is the Sovda lift.  It is the first loader designed for the specialty coffee industry with a destoner built in.  </p>
<p>What makes it special:</p>
<ul>
<li>High speed opening and closing of the outlet</li>
<li>Adjustable legs so that it can even been recessed in concrete for roasters with low outlets</li>
<li>All food grade stainless steel</li>
<li>Beautiful sight glass</li>
</ul>
<p>​We have finalized our prototype and manufacturing and just need to raise $25,000 to place our first order.  </p>
<p>With specialty coffee roasters in mind, our equipment is made to integrate with 15 to 90kg capacity roasters. We’ve experienced the pain points of specialty roasters, lack of equipment to meet their needs and made solutions with better design and technology. Sovda machines are made to be aesthetically pleasing and simple to use. Our products have been developed     and tested with the Torch Coffee Research &amp; Development Lab. The Pearl Mini, Sovda Lift and Precision Fill are designed to seamlessly integrate into the existing operations of Specialty Coffee Roasters. Not only did we apply smart technology and elegant Scandinavian design principles to the specific requirements of specialty roasters, we designed our supply chain and manufacturing model to offer quality workmanship backed by fanatical support, at a price specialty roasters can afford.      </p>

<h3>Spellbound Butterscotch Beer</h3>
<p>Magic is thirsty work and since the 14th century Phileas Fry's Butterscotch Beer has been a firm favourite with Wizards and Witches and served on Shambles in York.</p>
<p>Hundreds of years after the last bottle was served Phileas Fry's ancestors Ben and Phil have recreated his magical apothecary and once again are serving magical potions in The Potions Cauldron.</p>
<p>They now want to bring back their ancestors most famous product, and once again be serving Spellbound Butterscotch Beer, with its caramel and vanilla taste and just a hint of magic.</p>

The result?An incredible cookware collection designed to help you cook better and improve your experience in the kitchen.     Sadly, most cookware sold today is either dramatically overpriced due to traditional retail markups, poorly made, or even both.By cutting out retail middlemen and selling directly to customers online, we’re able to deliver incredible cookware at an honest price.  When designing the Misen Cookware collection, we first took a deep dive into material selection. Much like a great meal requires great ingredients, so too does a quality pan require quality materials.We explored using a variety of different materials, and combinations of materials, in order to find a selection with optimal performance for cooks in a variety of settings; primarily at home but also in professional kitchens. After extensive research and testing, we selected a 3.0 millimeter thick, 5-ply composite featuring 5 alternating layers of stainless steel and aluminum for the Misen Cookware collection. Translation?Incredible heat conduction and retention for better, more evenly cooked food.  In tandem with the materials selection process, we set about designing each of the individual bases, primary handles, helper handles, and lids for our cookware collection. After many months and countless sketches, CAD files, and 3D prototypes, we landed on a design solution of cookware that can not only withstand the rigors of daily use and abuse for years to come, but is also (in our humble opinion) beautiful as well.    Every piece and specific component of the Misen Cookware collection was carefully considered and designed for its intended use in the kitchen. These intentional design features present themselves in both obvious and more subtle ways.For example, instead of creating a saucepan, we instead chose to design a (much better) saucier for our collection, as the saucier's rounded walls make stirring and whisking easier.And as is perhaps less noticeable, we not only chose to make all of our cookware edges rounded for drip-free pouring, we also made them closed so the inner metal layers (""plys"") are not exposed to external conditions and as a result are more durable over time.The end result of these considerations, big and small, are four amazing pieces of cookware designed to help you cook better.    While quality cookware is without a doubt essential, which cookware you need is influenced by a number of factors, namely: what kinds of foods you typically cook, how many people you cook for, how much storage you have, and if you want to limit yourself to the bare minimum or give yourself a few extra pieces to experiment with (or for entertaining).We've created three sets of Misen Cookware that accommodate most people's needs in a home cooking setting. Note that you are also able to supplement any set with additional add-ons (see below) as may fit your cooking needs.  If this is your first time backing an Indiegogo campaign, don't worry! Below is a simple guide to backing our campaign. And if you have any questions, don't hesitate to shoot us a direct message here on Indiegogo or by email at hello@misen.co    We've made a significant amount of progress in bringing Misen Cookware to life, and are in fact nearly ready to press that big ""Go"" button for production.Most recently, over the last 10 months we've completed custom tooling for each Misen Cookware piece, finished our first pilot production run, and performed extensive testing on pilot production units.  It takes a village.We are incredibly grateful to have had the opportunity to work with a talented, passionate group of cooks, designers and operators to make Misen Cookware a reality. We could not have done it without you all. And our moms. Thank you moms.",28.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p style=""text-align: center;"">My name is Brady. I am enthusiastic about creativity. I'm a musician, a tradesman, and a people person.</p>
<h2><strong>THE GOAL:</strong></h2>
<p>To share my craft and design with others who will enjoy it, while fulfilling my own dreams and bringing much needed help in the form of clean water to people around the world.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>THE STORY:</strong></h2>
<p>A few weeks ago my brain had an idea.  ""Hey, Brady! You own too many coasters and they are all inferior. You should use your skills to craft something awesome! A new breed of coaster! It's gotta be sexy... It's gotta be art. It's gotta be functional...hmmmm...the coaster to end all coasters!""

I was getting inspired and brainstorming for hours on end about what this could be. I had been searching for a project  just like this.</p>
<p>So I started working on my design and execution, night after night...but something happened after about a week. I began to look around at my piles of projects and start questioning, ""What If I could actually do a some good with these coasters? What if it's not <i>all  </i>about me? And maybe these coasters have a story to tell."" So I started looking for opportunities. That's when I stumbled on <a href=""https://www.charitywater.org/?x=1&amp;x=1&amp;x=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Charity: Water.</a> That night was not the first time I discovered the charity, but it was the most powerful. I encourage you to click on the link and watch their story. You will be moved. Their cause in a nutshell: Bring clean and safe water to people in developing countries.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>THE COASTERS:</strong></h2>
<p>The coasters  have been carefully designed from the ground up. My first goal above all else was to make a coaster that replaces all others, and will outlive me. They are made from Cement and various hardwoods, so they are naturally very durable, with enough weight to not get stuck to the bottom of your glass. The cement and wood are both very smooth, and the cement will be slightly absorptive. They will  be coated with a thin, glossy clear protective finish and have a thin protective barrier (most likely cork) on the underside of the coaster. The coasters when finished are 4"" in diameter and  just under  a 1/2"" thick.</p>
<p>I am currently at the tail end of perfecting the finishing process and planning for faster manufacturing.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>
<strong>Funding: </strong> </h2>
<p>The costs to get up and running at a small production level will about $1,500. This will be used to purchase equipment like a thickness planer, power sanders, a heavy duty drill press, and of course, materials. If the demand for coasters goes up and we <i>greatly </i>exceed our goals, the need for a faster production process will increase. This would potentially mean the purchasing of a CNC machine to aid in cutting the wood portion of the coasters. If funding goals are not met, Perks will still be fulfilled, and 30% of all profits will still be donated to Charity: Water.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>THANK YOU:</strong></h2>
<p>Please join me in bringing this project to life, bring clean safe water to people around the world, and open up the door for a whole world of other artistic woodworking endeavors.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>TL;DR - Sob story, we need your help!</p>
<p><br/>As you are all probably very aware, the Coronavirus pandemic has hit everyone pretty hard these last few weeks and it seems very few are exempt from its wrath. Us market and street food traders are no exception and unfortunately we were forced to stop trading on Tuesday 17th March due to a combination of market closures, declining sales and a moral obligation to prevent the spread as much as possible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The sad reality is we have no money coming in and potentially face going out of business, leaving a crew without jobs and an amazing bunch of customers without their favourite lunch. The truth is, it's impossible to say when we will be back up and running so we are raising money to try and keep our business afloat financially. With a bit of help, when this is all over, our two street food vans, Jesus and Mary, will be there to trade at the markets and festivals we've been slinging burritos at for the last 13 years.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Luardos was set up in 2007 and has been around to see the whole street food industry kick off in the UK. Our two vans trade at Whitecross Street Market Mon-Fri, Brockley Market on Saturdays and Kerb markets across London. In the summer, Mary and the crew up sticks and get on the road travelling across the UK to trade at festivals like Glastonbury, End of the Road, Lost Village and Latitude. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We've had loads of people on the socials asking how they can help so here we are... For everyone we see daily at Whitecross Street, or at Brockley Market every Saturday, or the festival goers who seek us out every year at festivals looking for sustenance to help their hangovers. We love and appreciate all your custom and the relationship we have and know it's reciprocated. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We hate asking for handouts so we've come up with some pretty RADICAL pledges for you so have a look - there's some bangers! <br/> </p>
<p>We're desperate to get back out there trading when this is all over and be there to feed all of our amazing regulars, so now more than ever it's important to support local and independent!</p>

<h3>A Little About Us</h3>
<p>Ex Novo Brewing Company started in 2014 in Portland, OR and expanded with its second brewery in Corrales, NM in 2019. Founder Joel Gregory grew up in Corrales, and enjoys being close to (4!) generations of his family that live here. We have made it through the worst of the pandemic, but it will still be awhile before restrictions are fully lifted, and we want to begin on phase 1.5 of our plan to bring great beer to an amazing space where it can be enjoyed in our new outdoor bar and beer garden.</p>
<p>To utilize the space we have on our 3 acre property in Corrales, we need to extend beyond the patio and small taproom we've been using since opening almost two years ago. We have a great concept for this expansion, but do not have all the funds required to complete the project.</p>
<p>This is where you come in! We need Ex Novo believers, who have either experienced our beer or space first hand, or just appreciate what we're trying to do to make our community a little bit better.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1613706976/odzjrmtsmca6mrwrodta.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have preliminary project costs, but as we know with our past experience with these projects, the budget will undoubtedly swell. We are trying to raise at least $60,000, which after campaign costs, can cover at least half of the project cost. These include: architecture and design, construction of buildings and shade structures, equipment, tables and chairs, landscaping, lighting, etc. However, the more we are able to raise, the better the beer garden will be, and we hope you get to enjoy that in person! Imagine you're getting to help fund your new living room ;) We will be spending 100% of the funds raised on the beer garden, and will have significant buy-in from our business as well, but we don't think we can get there alone. This year has been...sub-optimal to say the least. </p>
<p>We have some pretty killer ideas for perks for this campaign. We're fortunate enough to have the talented JB as Creative Director on our staff, and if you've seen our merch and label designs, you know we can put together some great looking stuff! Outside of swag and wearables, we have some unique experiences to offer, and we'll be pulling out all the stops to make these experiences simply unforgettable! </p>
<p>If we don’t reach our goal, all of the funds will still be used to construct the beer garden, but a full funding ensures we achieve the standard we’re planning on, with a grand opening in Summer ’21.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Perks greater than $100 automatically get an invite for (1) to our pre-opening bash when construction is complete, before opening to the public.</span></p>

<h3><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: 700;letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Impact</span></h3>
</div><div>
<p>This beer garden is the unfolding of our full  vision for our Corrales property. The reason we bought a 3-acre property in the first place was to take advantage of the feeling of open space, less crowding, and expansive views. You'll experience unobstructed views of the Sandia Mountains, almost an acre of grass and trees, and twice the number of seats we have currently at our taproom. This expansion will be good for our business, but it will also be good for our community, providing a place where small or large groups can gather (post-COVID restrictions) without worrying if there will be enough room. We’ve already begun booking wedding receptions and larger events. It will be huge for us to be able to accommodate these major life events without having to close for business, as we can keep the taproom open if the Beer Garden is rented.</p>
<p>The truth is, we are not a start-up, and we have shown by our track record that we know how to manage our projects and create memorable spaces with the 3 locations we currently have. We've never been a company that is going to build a cookie-cutter concept in a cookie-cutter building; the Ex Novo experience is meant to make you feel something, and we think this area will really resonate with what people are looking for!</p>
<p>We're also excited to build our team! A second bar and more space means more jobs! We pride ourselves as being good to our team, and taking care of our employees - we would love to be able to grow our team in this way.</p>
<p> </p>

</div><div>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Is There Risk?</span></h3>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Construction projects have a tendency to go over budget. Even if we fall short of our goal, we will complete the project, it just will not include all of the design elements we'd like to see.</span></p>
<p>We will be able to deliver on all of our perks, because we are already open. There is always risk in committing to any sort of timeline, as we're captive to the timeline of permits, inspections and getting the work completed quickly. Even if we end up missing the summer, which would make us sad, we will have more built-in heaters installed and will have a place that is still excellent, even in the colder months.</p>
<p> </p>

This is where you come in! We need Ex Novo believers, who have either experienced our beer or space first hand, or just appreciate what we're trying to do to make our community a little bit better.
 


What We Need & What You Get
We have preliminary project costs, but as we know with our past experience with these projects, the budget will undoubtedly swell. We are trying to raise at least $60,000, which after campaign costs, can cover at least half of the project cost. These include: architecture and design, construction of buildings and shade structures, equipment, tables and chairs, landscaping, lighting, etc. However, the more we are able to raise, the better the beer garden will be, and we hope you get to enjoy that in person! Imagine you're getting to help fund your new living room ;) We will be spending 100% of the funds raised on the beer garden, and will have significant buy-in from our business as well, but we don't think we can get there alone. This year has been...sub-optimal to say the least. 
We have some pretty killer ideas for perks for this campaign. We're fortunate enough to have the talented JB as Creative Director on our staff, and if you've seen our merch and label designs, you know we can put together some great looking stuff! Outside of swag and wearables, we have some unique experiences to offer, and we'll be pulling out all the stops to make these experiences simply unforgettable! 
If we don’t reach our goal, all of the funds will still be used to construct the beer garden, but a full funding ensures we achieve the standard we’re planning on, with a grand opening in Summer ’21.
Perks greater than $100 automatically get an invite for (1) to our pre-opening bash when construction is complete, before opening to the public.
 

The Impact

This beer garden is the unfolding of our full  vision for our Corrales property. The reason we bought a 3-acre property in the first place was to take advantage of the feeling of open space, less crowding, and expansive views. You'll experience unobstructed views of the Sandia Mountains, almost an acre of grass and trees, and twice the number of seats we have currently at our taproom. This expansion will be good for our business, but it will also be good for our community, providing a place where small or large groups can gather (post-COVID restrictions) without worrying if there will be enough room. We’ve already begun booking wedding receptions and larger events. It will be huge for us to be able to accommodate these major life events without having to close for business, as we can keep the taproom open if the Beer Garden is rented.
The truth is, we are not a start-up, and we have shown by our track record that we know how to manage our projects and create memorable spaces with the 3 locations we currently have. We've never been a company that is going to build a cookie-cutter concept in a cookie-cutter building; the Ex Novo experience is meant to make you feel something, and we think this area will really resonate with what people are looking for!
We're also excited to build our team! A second bar and more space means more jobs! We pride ourselves as being good to our team, and taking care of our employees - we would love to be able to grow our team in this way.
 


Is There Risk?
Construction projects have a tendency to go over budget. Even if we fall short of our goal, we will complete the project, it just will not include all of the design elements we'd like to see.
We will be able to deliver on all of our perks, because we are already open. There is always risk in committing to any sort of timeline, as we're captive to the timeline of permits, inspections and getting the work completed quickly. Even if we end up missing the summer, which would make us sad, we will have more built-in heaters installed and will have a place that is still excellent, even in the colder months.
 

​Other Ways You Can Help

Even if it’s just $10, every contribution helps in getting us closer to our goal.
Spread the good word! Share on your social media platforms and email lists and make some noise for us; we really want the whole area to hear about this project. Indiegogo has really great share tools too!",5.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Turner Haus Brewery is a brewery concept with the mission to create a fun, welcoming environment for craft beer enthusiast, and homebrewers alike. Our mission is to not  only cater to beer drinkers but to also support the community of Chicago homebrewers by providing resources,  and support programming.  Recent reports have shown that Chicago has far outpaced all other major microbrewery markets in the US, recently becoming the new Beer Capitol of America. The National Homebrewers Association has also shown that the Midwest is the second largest market of homebrewers. In our research for prospective locations for Turner Haus Brewery, we naturally sought to plant our roots on the South Side of Chicago between Hyde Park and South Loop. While Chicago has risen to become the new Beer Capitol of America, the overwhelming majority of this industry growth has taken place outside of South Chicago. We believe in the vision for Bronzeville and are drawn to the current trajectory of the 51st Street corridor.  Our intent is to support the vision of revitalization for Bronzeville by contributing a multipurpose craft beer destination. Beer enthusiast brought to the corridor as a result of Turner Haus Brewery will thereby increase  foot traffic for other businesses in the area. With the support of the recent statistics that has made Chicago America’s Beer Capitol we are confident this is the time to bring our long-dreamed vision for Turner Haus Brewery to fruition in our home of Bronzeville.</p>
<p>While we have no shortage of excitement, enthusiasm, or beer, the road ahead to our grand opening is long with many challenges and we need all the help and support we can get. That said, this Oktober we will be launching our merchandise fundraising and tasting campaign to raise fund to purchase a building in Bronzeville Chicago.</p>

<p>My name is Mary Bass and I am a chef based out of Galveston, Texas. It has been a dream of mine to open a kitchen on the island for catering, private dinners and community events. I am calling it “La Cocina” which simply means, the Kitchen. I need the help of my local community to make this dream come true. With your assistance we can build a space that people will come to enjoy homemade local dishes, build relationships with fellow diners and enjoy unique, world class food.</p>
<p>I need $30,000 to get La Cocina completely outfitted. This includes big stuff like a convection oven down to little stuff like paint and health department permits. Every single dollar that is given will be put to good use to get the space operational, beautiful and able to meet the needs of the island community. For my donors, you will be called the “Primeros” which means first. You will have unique access to our launch party, special events and ticketed dinners before the general public. If we don’t reach our full goal, every donation will get me closer to getting operational and cooking out of my own kitchen.</p>
<p>This project is very near and dear to me. I am a 5th generation Galvestonian and I have always wanted a space on the island to cook beautiful gulf seafood and southern classics with a Latin flair. I will be able to host events in conjunction with the Galveston’s Own Farmers Market, it will be a space for Galveston College Culinary Students to come intern, I will be able to host book signings and art events. I have lived in Galveston County for my entire life and I am blessed to have helped the community in the wakes of some of our darkest times. Helping in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, the shooting at Santa Fe High School and the Government Shutdown have molded my sense of community even more. Asking for help is not something I am good at, but I could use a little fairy dust to help me get this dream into reality.</p>
<p>With any small business there are risks. For the past 7 years I have been building my client base and brand. My goal is to be a million-dollar catering company in 5 years. This is the first step in order to make that happen. I have the chef skills and hug skills and people skills; I just need a couple dollars to get this space turned into perfection.</p>
<p>I know it’s not in everyone’s budget to help, but if you can please share this campaign, volunteer if I have a workday to come paint walls, clean dishes, organize shelves… a little sweat equity goes a long way. I really appreciate every person who takes the time to consider this.</p>

Some ""exceptional"" shapes might not perfectly fit. If you have such a bottle, please let us know by emailing us. We will help you find the best way to take care of your bottle.Our first product: Caveasy One is not able to receive magnums and bigger format of bottles but we are working on a solution for the next ones.Puis-je ranger n'importe quel format de bouteille dans Caveasy?La forme des emplacements du plateau a été étudiée pour permettre le rangement de tous les formats classiques de 75cl. Il est possible que certaines bouteilles aux formes ""exotiques"" ne puissent pas être rangées correctement. Si c'est le cas n'hésitez pas à revenir vers nous pour que nous trouvions ensemble une solution.Cette première version ne prend pas en charge les magnums mais une version spéciale du plateau est à l'étude. Can I add new racks easily?If you need to increase your storage capacity, you just need to stack and connect a new rack (or more) to your existing Caveasy system. This new rack(s) will automatically be taken into account by the system when you connect it.Peut-on rajouter des plateaux facilement?Pour augmenter votre capacité de stockage, il vous suffit de rajouter un plateau.

<h3>Hello, we are Mo Better Burgers.</h3>
<p>We celebrate being a mother/daughter partnership born and raised in the Miracle Mile neighborhood of Los Angeles, who’ve mastered serving burgers and gathering community for decades.</p>
<p>We have been cooking and operating the restaurant ourselves since relaunching Mo Better Burgers at our current La Brea location five years ago. We built Mo Better with our own hands without investors, relying only on experience and resourcefulness. Throughout the decades our food &amp; service has received several taste awards, celebrity endorsements and overwhelming loyal neighborhood support.</p>
<p>Today, we are calling on our community – to those who believe in ideals of entrepreneurship, community and small business – to help us.</p>
<p>Our ultimate goal is to serve our neighborhood the way we’ve always wanted. Your donations will not only save Mo Better but will sustain an L.A institution.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>OUR CHALLENGES</strong></h3>
<p>In spite of our successes, we are currently in danger of closing the restaurant due to our lack of access to business capital. As a Women-Owned small business, we have been denied the necessary funding to continue operating amidst the overwhelming corporate takeover of our Miracle Mile area.</p>
<p>Two years ago we were excited to acquire an additional 500 sq ft of dining space to expand the restaurant and serve more of you, our loyal customers. We were then informed by our contractor that <strong>unexpected</strong> City approved plans and permits would be required to complete the expansion. Furthermore, we found out that the entire additional space would need to be leveled...to bring the floor up 8 inches higher!As costs started mounting, the expansion was never completed, even though we’ve maintained the lease for this additional space (for two years; in excess of $50,000 now!) in good faith that we would one day be able to finally fully expand the dining space successfully.</p>
<p>Naturally, this delay in finding funding has caused extreme financial hardship for our business as we’ve strived to maintain the quality of our food and service first that customers have loved for decades, in the face of our expenses and expansion needs.</p>
<p>We feel it is our responsibility as small business owners and entrepreneurs to be transparent with you, our beloved public, about our current situation; to shed light on everything about our struggles publicly.</p>
<p>We ask you to HELP US because we simply cannot survive in the face of this challenge.</p>
<p>If we do not find funding...We will be forced to close Mo Better’s doors...for good....in the Spring of 2018.</p>
<p>Please do all that you can...Give all that you can...To prevent this from happening.</p>
<p>Help us keep Mo Better’s doors open serving the Burgers you know and love so much.</p>

<h3><strong>MO BETTER COMMUNITY</strong></h3>
<p>As you’re reading this, you’re probably aware that you, The Mo Better community, are a beautiful reflection of the vast diversity of Los Angeles itself. You know that the Owners are also the Employees here. And we make sure we know your name (and sometimes, your order, by heart), which is why we've been nicknamed the 'Cheers' of burger restaurants; making all who walk through our doors feel like family...because you are!</p>
<p>Many of you have told us that we, Mo Better Burgers, have been the ONLY place left in the City, where you feel comfortable to come converse, meet, and eat with your friends and family.</p>
<p>In addition to serving Los Angeles, Mo Better Burgers has now garnered an international fanbase! We’re even listed in popular travel guides, so its no surprise when groups of tourists from Japan, Saudi Arabia, and Australia - to name a few - walk in for a bite.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>EXPANSION PLANS</strong></h3>
<p>We are nestled in the heart of LA’s developing La Brea “Restaurant Row,” near the new Wilshire Metro Link station and developing LACMA Museum. Overall, we will be expanding and improving the Mo Better Burger experience for the entire Los Angeles community with kitchen and dining renovation, additional staffing, and extension of operating hours.</p>
<p>A complete kitchen renovation would include more grill and burger prep area guaranteeing shorter wait times for customer orders. A full dining renovation will more than double our current seating and allow us to comfortably accommodate you and large parties/office groups. Most importantly, your donations will allow us to increase our staff and be open for dinner hours. This opportunity will allow us to positively affect our neighborhood employment rate.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>It was 2015. There she was, sitting at the bar, reading Harper's Magazine at a kind of divey bar.  He said, ""Who does that?"" and then he approached her and asked, ""Are you reading Harper's?  At a bar?""</p>
<p>That was the beginning of a friendship and the idea for the Rose City Book Pub.  Jorge had conceived of a bookstore/bar as a pipe dream, but that reader, Elise, convinced him that together they could make it a reality.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501390439/wybuh1zzgtehdyp52kl3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<h3>Our Vision</h3>
<p>We have so many ideas for the Rose City Book Pub.  Our ideal building is an old bungalow in N, NE, or SE not farther out than about 72nd.  We'll use the living room and dining room as the main bar, and we'll convert the bedrooms into small living rooms for people looking for a quieter atmosphere.  The bedrooms will be available for people to reserve for book clubs, meetings, and private parties.  We don't plan to charge a rental fee, just a food and drink minimum. </p>
<p>Everything we sell will be carefully curated: good books, good wine, good beer, good food.  We plan to have a house red and a house white that are tasty at a reasonable price, along with a rotating selection of excellent wines that might be more spendy.  A large portion of the books will be literature, but there will also be non-fiction, local authors, graphic novels, and children's books. </p>
<p>We aspire to be a meeting place for the community.  Some activities and events we have imagined:</p>
<ul>
<li>author readings</li>
<li>poetry nights</li>
<li>art shows</li>
<li>live music</li>
<li>beer and wine trainings</li>
<li>lecture series</li>

It became apparent that <strong>we needed more space</strong> in our fridge for fresh produce, more space for customers, for our equipment, for prepping and for preparing the burgers. Which lead us to the heart-breaking decision to suspend serving our burgers until we found a better equipped space.

As a DACA recipient Zaid has been working to pass the Dream Act bill in Washington DC and Missouri, with local organization KSMODA &amp; United We Dream; the largest immigrant youth organization in the US. </p>
<p>Zaid's experience in restaurants began as a dishwasher in his middle school years. Several humble years later took him to his family's business, Vive Latino. His status as an immigrant stopped him from further continuing his college education or a career in the TV and  film industry. After moving back to Kansas and working at a local restaurant, he decided to pursue a better life than what had been handed to him. It was his manager that encouraged him to think bigger, he was told to continue cleaning; as he was ""just another illegal Mexican"".  After rejoining his mother's corner store in a struggling time, he took on responsibility to help his family. His first personal endeavor as a Head Chef, began with Happy-X. A desperate move to save the family business, Happy-X became a cafe that shared space with a Peruvian restaurant. From Happy-X emerged Pirate's Bone, with a $2,000.00 private loan from a regular customer at the cafe. Pirate's Bone, which began as a coffee shop and eventually lead him back to his passion for culinary creation. In July of 2018 Pirate's Bone ditched dairy and became Kansas City's most popular immigrant owned all vegan cafe. </p>

Intersectional Vegan Chef, Owner and Founder, Zaid Consuegra Sauza takes pride in the flavors he creates as well as the artistic presentation of each dish.  Featured in Food network, VegNews, Feast Magazine, Pitch, KC Live, KCUR, ACLU, Open Belly Podcast, etc. Zaid quickly found that interest in his compassionate cuisine was growing rapidly. Recently, Pirate's Bone hit more than one road block to continuing to serve their patrons in it's current location. This brings us to our current campaign. What you need to know & What We NeedSoon after launching our burgers we realized there was a much larger demand than we ever imagined. It became apparent that we needed more space in our fridge for fresh produce, more space for customers, for our equipment, for prepping and for preparing the burgers. Which lead us to the heart-breaking decision to suspend serving our burgers until we found a better equipped space. Apart from the lack of space, our current location is nestled in a neighborhood limiting our visibility to the main flow of traffic on foot, bike, scooter, bus and cars. The majority of our customers travel by car and have expressed to us their struggle of finding parking in the small 7 car lot we share with 5 other businesses.Then like many other great businesses in the Kansas City metro, we had a tremendously long and harsh winter. This winter resulted in us losing close to 70% of our regular sales. Our earnings & savings went out the window rapidly as we tried to lessen the impact on our business and employees. We are choosing to treat these hard times as great opportunity to continue Plant-based accessibility to the Kansas City Community.  We've found a space! Our minimum goal is to raise $20,000. Your contributions to our campaign will directly go towards our move to 20th & Main St. in the Crossroads. Achieving our fundraising goal will open our doors to an expanded community in Mid-Spring 2019. We have 2 weeks to sign a new lease for our future home. This is an ideal location because this area has high foot traffic, is densely populated and more diverse. On top of those external benefits, there is more space for the kitchen and storage which solves one of the major issues we encountered at our current location.The population is 229,000+ people within a 3 mile radius. The average income is $31,800 to $47,100. Within that same 3 mile radius there are over 300,000 employees. We need to sell a minimum of 80 burgers a day in order to pay bills, employees and make a small profit. Our previous sales numbers indicate a bright future in this location. We will be able to continue to provide an all plant-based menu and support the continued growth of accessible Plant-Based food in Kansas City. This allows us an opportunity to make a bigger impact and serve healthy and delicious plant-based burgers, sandwiches & waffles. Chef Zaid and his crew have a strong belief in serving as many people as possible, those on a vegan diet and those who are not.  Pirate's Bone strives to be accessible by people of different income levels, color, gender and backgrounds. We are here to be inclusive.

Each meal consumed makes a positive impact on animals, health and our planet.In recent divisive times, Chef Zaid found himself in the spotlight as a DACA recipient and business owner. His role as an influencer is affected by both his immigration status and his passion to embrace plant-based and vegan culinary exploration.

<p>So you might not know anything about us... We are Manchester's newest theatre and the only one to host a rep company. What's a rep company we hear you ask... well amigos it's a company of people who all make shows together pretty much non-stop.</p>
<p>We've teamed up with the Great Northern Warehouse to build our theatre and are currently rushing around like mad men trying to get it all ready for when you first step into the place.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Give us your money &amp; We'll give you a drink</h3>
<p>We need to raise at least £500 to physically build the bar and to kit it out with all of the essential to make drinks for you wonderful people. We are not after a donation though (unless you want to give one of course). What we're asking is that you give us your money (in multiples of £5) and you'll be able to spend that money at the bar when we open from the 6th March.</p>
</div><div><h3>The Impact</h3></div><div><p>It's difficult running a business in this day and age. Even harder to run a bar. However we don't have half the costs that a normal bar does and we already have people coming into our space on a frequent basis. The £500 we're raising will be the initial outlay for the bar but the ongoing benefit of having this god send is that we can use it to be a pretty awesome bar where you'd want to spend a good night out but also keep our audiences watered. We're not blind, it is difficult to run a bar however we're convinced that you'll want to come and hang with us.</p></div><div>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We're Hendrik and Tahira, Co-Founders of Kazi Yetu and Tanzania Tea Collection. We started up our social enterprise in 2018 in Tanzania with a goal to increase job opportunities and income in agriculture, especially for women. </p>
<p>Kazi Yetu is transformative because we add value locally in Tanzania to our products, such as blending, packaging, and branding, creating more economic growth before exporting across the world! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This raise of EUR 15,000 will help us buy a tea blending and packaging machine to increase our production of pyramid tea bags from 2,000 per day to 800,000 per day! We would love for you to take this opportunity to help us take our start-up to the next level, scaling to reach more farmers, create more jobs, and grow. </p>
<p>Due to the current situation with COVID-19, we have struggled to raise funds and grow as effectively as we planned in 2020. Help us reach our goals of transformation and trade, while enjoying cups of tea over the Christmas season. </p>
<p>You may contribute a donation as you wish, or purchase bundles of teas and other goodies:</p>

We're Hendrik and Tahira, Co-Founders of Kazi Yetu and Tanzania Tea Collection. We started up our social enterprise in 2018 in Tanzania with a goal to increase job opportunities and income in agriculture, especially for women. 
Kazi Yetu is transformative because we add value locally in Tanzania to our products, such as blending, packaging, and branding, creating more economic growth before exporting across the world! 

What We Need & What You Get
This raise of EUR 15,000 will help us buy a tea blending and packaging machine to increase our production of pyramid tea bags from 2,000 per day to 800,000 per day! We would love for you to take this opportunity to help us take our start-up to the next level, scaling to reach more farmers, create more jobs, and grow. 
Due to the current situation with COVID-19, we have struggled to raise funds and grow as effectively as we planned in 2020. Help us reach our goals of transformation and trade, while enjoying cups of tea over the Christmas season. 
You may contribute a donation as you wish, or purchase bundles of teas and other goodies:

bundles of your own selection of our teas,
branded teacups that are reusable hand-blown glass (in collaboration with Sol Cups, which is also a woman-owned business promoting sustainable living),
and planting trees in Morogoro as part of Sustainable Agriculture Tanzania's (SAT) reforestation program. SAT is one of our partners that trains farmers on holistic and sustainable agriculture, provides support with logistics, drying, and storage, and promotes long-term growth for farmers. They supply us with herbs and spices for our blends, including hibiscus and cardamom.

Bundles are designed for individual orders, group orders for you and your friends, loved ones, and a full range for all your Christmas gifts this year! If you'd like to order a customized bundle, please send us an email on hello@kazi-yetu.com.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is <strong>Jonathan Dailey</strong>, the writer and director of the film. I've been making film since I was as young as 13. This is my passion and dream that I have never let loose of following. Contributing to this film will not only help fund a student project, but rather invest in tens of student's futures. </p>
<p>My name is<strong> Drew Jackson</strong> and I am one of the producers for the film. My love for film making started my junior year in high school. I took a video production class and I immediately knew it was what I wanted to pursue as a career. </p>
<p><strong>John Stinson</strong> here, our team has been working incredibly hard to get this project off of the ground. But all of that work is worth it when you are such a big fan of the script like I am.</p>
<p>My name is <strong>Alex Haarmann. </strong>Ever since coming here to Missouri State I have fallen in love with film and everything about it. I love the script we are working with and think it has the potential to be a great short film. But between now and when the final production comes out we have a lot of work to do. </p>
<p>My name is <strong>Luke Bowers. </strong>I am a huge lover of all things film related. I am so excited to be a producer for this project and we have a wonderful script to work with. Johnny has such a great vision for this film. Please help with any donations it will be such a great help. </p>
<p>This campaign is very important to us because it helps us reach our end goal of producing a short film. All of the cast and crew are doing this because of their passion for film making. No one is getting paid and keeping everyone fed is our top priority. A happy cast and crew makes a successful cast and crew. </p>
<p>Your funds would benefit the stomachs, hearts, and minds of everyone working on the production. Keep our stomachs full so we may have the energy to continue on when the sun comes close to setting. Our hearts become full with gratitude as we realize people are gracious enough to have faith in our work. Our minds will stay on track to produce one of the greatest student short films that Missouri State has ever seen.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our overall goal is to raise $1600 dollars for fruit, vegetables, bread, deli meat, granola bars, and water. All will be purchased in bulk from Sam's Club to feed our cast and crew over the span of two weeks. The cost of the food comes in at around $1400, we are asking for an extra $200 to cover any additional expenses that may come up. </p>The sole purpose of this campaign is to ultimately make sure that we take care of our cast and crew. They play a massive role in this project and we want to make sure they know how much we appreciate them. </div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will go towards the fulfillment of college students goal to work in the film industry. This project will give many different students hands on experience in the film world, ultimately expanding our resumes and setting us up for future success in film production.</p>
<p>The main thing I want to point out is that we are college students. We are very broke! Our passion and ambition are at it's peak, all we need to apply this are the funds. Having free meals is the cornerstone for making this project work. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We do have outdoor scenes that could possibly be ruined by rain but we are very organized and we could push those scenes back and work on indoor scenes that day instead. This might add an extra day or two but this is why we are asking for an extra $200 in case a situation like this arises. </p>
<p>The only other challenge that might come up is flaking cast and crew. It is very unlikely that this will happen if we get meals funded. It is a scientific fact that a college student cannot turn down a free meal. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We appreciate any sort of support you can show us! Not only is funds important, we would like to get the word out for our project. Please share this with all of your friends and spread our cause to any who might be interested in supporting us. We just want to make a short film and we can't do it without your help. Thank you so much. </p>

The Ratio Six is the coffee maker you've been waiting for. I'm a coffee equipment nerd, and this is what I've been working on for 3 years. I started Clive Coffee 10 years ago that imports customized, high quality, and expensive espresso machines directly from Italy. Why should espresso enthusiasts be the only ones with great looking equipment, I wondered?The Ratio Six is my attempt to offer an incredibly easy-to-use, beautiful-to-behold, pleasure-to-own coffee maker, at a price point that more people can afford.Coffee matters. It can provide the basis of a quiet bit of solitude to start your day, or a drink to share with a new friend, or a finale to a great dinner with those you love. Let Ratio brew amazing coffee for whatever you're doing with your time!-Mark Hellweg, Ratio founder One Button Simplicity. Simplify your coffee routine to the touch of a button. The Ratio Six’s Bloom, Brew, and Ready phases run in sequence, delivering a perfect (and easy) cup of coffee every time.Love pour over brewed by a skilled barista? So do we. But sometimes you need to *quickly* make great coffee. Ratio will handle the extraction for you. Just add cold water and freshly ground coffee.   Delicious, Perfectly Extracted Coffee. For Everyone.Our coffee machines are used by Top Chef champions and coffee professionals.  You can find the Ratio Eight in Palm Springs resort suites and in tiny coastal restaurants producing 15 course dinners reviewed by the New York Times.We wanted to expand the availability of great coffee, and the Six offers trusted coffee best practices in a more affordable format.The Ratio Six emulates a skilled barista pour over process, precisely metering water flow through both the Bloom and Brew phases. All of the taste. None of the work. Trusted by those with great palates.  Fibonacci Spiral Shower Head & Bloom After the button is pressed, Ratio gets to work on brewing great coffee. First, the powerful heating element sends hot water bubbling up through handblown glass supply lines to the stainless steel spiral shower head. Water is distributed over the ground coffee, causing a bubbly interaction called a “bloom.” The control board allows the Bloom to settle before delivering the rest of the hot water, slowly, near the ideal temperature (200º). The result? More evenly extracted grounds and a more amazing cup of coffee. Designed for today. And tomorrow. We designed the Ratio Six for longevity with precision formed stainless steel, borosilicate glass, and high end BPA-free copolymers. Every inch is built to last and covered by a 5-year warranty. Compact Size, Full PerformanceThe Six will fit in most kitchens without taking up too much countertop real estate.  Flexible BrewingThe Ratio Six ships with a thermal carafe designed for flat-bottom basket coffee filters. Prefer a conical filter? You can also use the Ratio Eight Thermal Carafe or Glass Carafe with a Chemex paper filter or stainless steel reusable Ratio Kone. Both the Ratio Six and Eight have the same brewing capacity (1.3 liters / 40 ounces). Read all the details on the Ratio Eight versus the Six. Modern Quality, 5 Year WarrantyThere are coffee machines that make great coffee, and there are coffee machines that look great. Ratio Six is both, combining form and function.Designed in Portland, Oregon, every Ratio machine is meticulously assembled by hand from components we manufacture with our overseas partner. While common appliances often have a built-in obsolescence and 1-3 year life span, every Ratio is built to last and covered by a 5-year limited warranty.   Technical, Yet SimpleAll of the features you need, with nothing that will clutter up your routine or provide too many options when you just want a cup of great coffee.   What’s Included

<h3>The case for Perky Planet</h3>
<p>While small businesses across the U.S struggle to find employees, over 70% of our neighbors with disabilities are unemployed.  Many are eager and able to work.  A job means independence. Security. Relationships. Respect. Dignity.  And when you ask employers who do hire people with disabilities they will tell you that they are assets to the business and ideal employees.  When given the same jobs, held to the same standards, and paid the same wage that they perform as well or better than their non-disabled co-workers.</p>

<p>I found out first-hand the struggles folks with disabilities face after a spinal cord injury left me paralyzed.  When looking for a job folks with disabilities face a death by a thousand cuts.  Transportation issues, the need for a flexible schedule, and the struggles with the hiring process are all challenges, but the cruelest cut of all is the unspoken belief that the person with disabilities can't really do the job.  That hiring people with disabilities is a ""nice thing to do"" if the business can ""afford it"".</p>

<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
<p>My name is Tristan Stewart and I've been in the craft beer industry in BC for 6 years. In that time I've worked in a variety of positions, gaining experience managing a tasting room and a bottle shop, serving beer, and assisting with daily brewing operations. I am a Certified Beer Server (First level of the Cicerone program, I am working on level 2: Certified Cicerone) and am an aspiring BJCP beer judge (Just waiting to take that darn exam!). I love beer, brewing, and blending. It has been my dream to open my own brewery for years.</p>
<p>I will be working with the fine folks at Luppolo Brewing Company, renting a portion of their warehouse space and utilizing their brewing system to create some fantastic oak-aged beers. Even if the goal is not reached I will be using the pledged money to begin the first phase of the project, with production starting immediately at the end of the campaign. Under the target goal means a smaller loan, translating to less barrels and slower production.</p>
<h3>What I Need Funding For</h3>
<p>I'm here looking for funding to put the first stages of a large plan in motion. The $16,000 - or whatever funds I receive - will be used to secure a loan with the bank, which will allow me to purchase the necessary equipment and begin production. A list of the equipment includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Barrels - Initially I will be acquiring used wine barrels from the Okanagan. I would also like to acquire one large wine puncheon which I will convert into a fruiting tank. </li>
<li>Blending Tank - A vessel to combine the contents of multiple barrels, let them settle, and package from. </li>
<li>Top-up Fermenter - Since  I will be performing primary fermentation in the barrels themselves, I will need to have a vessel to hold a portion of beer from each batch to top up the barrels once the vigorous initial fermentation has slowed down. </li>
<li>6-Head Bottle Filler - Fills bottles, which will be capped and labelled by hand with the help of some friends. I am currently accepting applications for friends. </li>
<li>Diaphragm Pump - A special type of pump for brewery use that is slower and much more gentle than a typical brewery pump. This goes a long way to reducing oxidization in fermented beer.</li>
<li>Brewing Odds &amp; Ends - Clamps, gaskets, hose, valves, etc. All the necessary little bits to connect the larger pieces of equipment. </li>
</ul>
<p>The equipment isn't the only cost. To fill the initial barrels I will have to brew multiple batches, which means lots of high-quality malt, pitch-able yeast and bacteria cultures and some hops. I plan to use very high quality ingredients because I believe this is the baseline for a superior product. </p>
<h3>What's In It For You?</h3>
<p>I have set up an array of unique perks for contributing to this project. For example, I am offering the unique experience of joining in on a barrel tasting or blending session. If you are interested in fermentation this is an incredible opportunity to sample some of the beers straight from the barrels, design your own blend, and have it potentially packaged!</p>
<p>I also am offering a discounted rate for the first year of the Cellar Society! This will be a yearly subscription providing access to exclusive, large-bottle beers. Included with membership is two bottles of 6 exclusive releases (12 bottles total) as well as a couple of very attractive Cellar Society exclusive stemmed glasses. Cellar Society Members also have the ability to reserve bottles of our regular releases, a maximum of 2 bottles per release and a total of 12 reserved at once. </p>
<p>In addition to the above, I am also offering vouchers which can be redeemed for beers as they are released. These options essentially allow you to pre-purchase one bottle of each of the first 3 or 6 releases. </p>
<p>I have included a few swag options - hats, shirts, and glassware. These will be made-to-order with our logo front and center.</p>
<p>Finally, you have the opportunity to name a barrel! Any subsequent beers that come from it will bear your name (or - assuming it is appropriate - a name of your choice) on the label! How cool is that!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Overall Benefit</h3>
<p>I believe that by focusing solely on oak-aged beers I can bring something unique and new to our local beer scene. </p>
<p>Assuming the funding goal is met, the proposed volume of releases for this project is approximately three new bottles each month. Initially these will be mixed fermentation farmhouse-style and sour ales, some with various fruit and some dry-hopped. In the future the variety of beers I produce will expand to include many other styles aged in a variety of wine and spirit barrels. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Looking Forward</h3>
<p>Completing this campaign and producing the first few batches is really just the first stage of my plan. Contracting space is not a permanent solution and I will be using the profit from the beers to renovate a warehouse with a tasting room. Once I have my own warehouse I will begin a dark barrel program consisting of Imperial Stouts, Belgian-style strong ales, Barleywines, etc. These will be kept physically separate from the mixed culture barrels to ensure there is no cross contamination. In addition to this, I will be looking to triple or quadruple the number of sour barrels in my program and acquiring a couple of foeders. I will also be playing around with using a mobile coolship for spontaneous inoculation by wild airborne microbes. </p>
<p>I've got big plans for this project, and I can't wait to put the first steps in motion. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you aren't able to contribute financially you can still help with this campaign, and your effort would mean the world to me. Please share this campaign on social media - Indiegogo has tools to make this super easy. And please tell all your friends! Not everyone uses social media and just by mentioning this project you are helping me gain traction. </p>
<p>Thank you for any contributions and I appreciate you taking the time to read through this page!</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

Blending Tank - A vessel to combine the contents of multiple barrels, let them settle, and package from. 
Top-up Fermenter - Since  I will be performing primary fermentation in the barrels themselves, I will need to have a vessel to hold a portion of beer from each batch to top up the barrels once the vigorous initial fermentation has slowed down. 
6-Head Bottle Filler - Fills bottles, which will be capped and labelled by hand with the help of some friends. I am currently accepting applications for friends. 
Diaphragm Pump - A special type of pump for brewery use that is slower and much more gentle than a typical brewery pump. This goes a long way to reducing oxidization in fermented beer.
Brewing Odds & Ends - Clamps, gaskets, hose, valves, etc. All the necessary little bits to connect the larger pieces of equipment. 

The equipment isn't the only cost. To fill the initial barrels I will have to brew multiple batches, which means lots of high-quality malt, pitch-able yeast and bacteria cultures and some hops. I plan to use very high quality ingredients because I believe this is the baseline for a superior product. 
What's In It For You?
I have set up an array of unique perks for contributing to this project. For example, I am offering the unique experience of joining in on a barrel tasting or blending session. If you are interested in fermentation this is an incredible opportunity to sample some of the beers straight from the barrels, design your own blend, and have it potentially packaged!
I also am offering a discounted rate for the first year of the Cellar Society! This will be a yearly subscription providing access to exclusive, large-bottle beers. Included with membership is two bottles of 6 exclusive releases (12 bottles total) as well as a couple of very attractive Cellar Society exclusive stemmed glasses. Cellar Society Members also have the ability to reserve bottles of our regular releases, a maximum of 2 bottles per release and a total of 12 reserved at once. 
In addition to the above, I am also offering vouchers which can be redeemed for beers as they are released. These options essentially allow you to pre-purchase one bottle of each of the first 3 or 6 releases. 
I have included a few swag options - hats, shirts, and glassware. These will be made-to-order with our logo front and center.
Finally, you have the opportunity to name a barrel! Any subsequent beers that come from it will bear your name (or - assuming it is appropriate - a name of your choice) on the label! How cool is that!

Overall Benefit
I believe that by focusing solely on oak-aged beers I can bring something unique and new to our local beer scene. 
Assuming the funding goal is met, the proposed volume of releases for this project is approximately three new bottles each month. Initially these will be mixed fermentation farmhouse-style and sour ales, some with various fruit and some dry-hopped. In the future the variety of beers I produce will expand to include many other styles aged in a variety of wine and spirit barrels. 

Looking Forward
Completing this campaign and producing the first few batches is really just the first stage of my plan. Contracting space is not a permanent solution and I will be using the profit from the beers to renovate a warehouse with a tasting room. Once I have my own warehouse I will begin a dark barrel program consisting of Imperial Stouts, Belgian-style strong ales, Barleywines, etc. These will be kept physically separate from the mixed culture barrels to ensure there is no cross contamination. In addition to this, I will be looking to triple or quadruple the number of sour barrels in my program and acquiring a couple of foeders. I will also be playing around with using a mobile coolship for spontaneous inoculation by wild airborne microbes. 
I've got big plans for this project, and I can't wait to put the first steps in motion. 

Other Ways You Can Help
If you aren't able to contribute financially you can still help with this campaign, and your effort would mean the world to me. Please share this campaign on social media - Indiegogo has tools to make this super easy. And please tell all your friends! Not everyone uses social media and just by mentioning this project you are helping me gain traction. 
Thank you for any contributions and I appreciate you taking the time to read through this page!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi fellow food, love, and life enthusiasts! My name is Nikki and I am the owner and chef of Darling Nikki’s BBQ, the world's #1 female-owned/operated, vegan friendly, vaguely Prince-themed BBQ food and sauce company.  For those of you who know us already Eat A Butt! ...and for those of you who don’t, Darling Nikki’s BBQ is a mobile BBQ company specializing in smoked meats, tasty treats, and real vegan eats!</p>
<p>In 2014 I set out to build my husband an ""ugly drum smoker"" as a DIY birthday present.  I spent hours on BBQ forums asking questions and researching how to build one of these things.  I painstakingly constructed the BBQ beast that would later be known as “Dorothy” in secret, hiding my efforts in my mother-in-laws backyard everyday after work. I had no idea that all my research and construction was just starting to bud into a full-fledged BBQ obsession.  </p>
<p>When I finally revealed the finished smoker to my husband he was ecsatic! We began our adventure of learning how to use Dorothy together.  I quickly became completely obsessed with attempting to smoke every food I could think of.  </p>
<p>We began a tradition of throwing two large parties a year where we would fill Dorothy to the brim with meat, get a couple cheap cases of beer, and invite everyone we knew to our small row home in Philly.  </p>
<p>The parties became a thing, and the BBQ got better.  The BBQ got so much better that I began booking gigs and catering events when I wasn’t working my full time job (I might have been making the shopping lists and planning while I was at work if we're being honest...). In February 2018 I finally pulled the plug on the corporate gig and plunged headlong into BBQ full time!</p>
<p>In two years the amount of growth, positive feedback, regular customers, and community support we have received has been incredible.  Darling Nikki’s BBQ has been a journey we have all gone on together and now it’s time for the next chapter.  </p>
<p>While we have been successful working out of commissary kitchens, catering out of the back of my Honda Civic, and splurging on the occasional Uhaul rental, it is time for Darling Nikki's to grow!  </p>
<p>The next step for Darling Nikki’s BBQ is to take my operation on the road alongside my traveling nurse husband.  This plan requires two things: a BBQ trailer, and a food truck. A food truck will give us the flexibility to vend daily on streets, at breweries, and to make some noise in the highly competitive food truck festival circuit.  The BBQ trailer allows us to expand our smoking capabilities, mobilize our daily prep operations, book private BBQ catering gigs, and attend nationwide BBQ competitions and festivals.</p>
<p>With this dream in mind we have crossed our fingers and maxed out my credit card to get started right away with our very own BBQ trailer!</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My goal with this fundraiser is to raise $50K to purchase the food truck and to help pay for the trailer we already purchased on credit.  I realize that $50K is no small coin to ask for, but our ability to take out large loans as a new business, or to generate this much revenue with our current equipment is not possible. We've received so much love and support to get us where we are today, and I'm hoping all of our loyal followers and new fans will join us now and help get Darling Nikki's BBQ on the road!</p>

In The Blackbeard, we saw an opportunity to create a next generation frying pan, implementing a new non-stick, non-scratch coating, on top of multiple layers of stainless steel. In the middle there is an aluminum core that evenly distributes the heat over the entire pan. This makes the Blackbeard suitable for all heat sources, including induction. We wanted The Blackbeard to be effective without compromise, and at the same time inspirational: its sleek and minimalist design should invite cooks of all levels into the kitchen to create something great.Together with 3,414 other pirates from across the seven seas, we’ve hacked the cookware industry. Passionate Cookware hackers all around the world - half of them from the US - have joined our mission to bring the Blackbeard to life. What a great start!

It's where we (Caitlyn and I [""I"" being Cody]) launched our roasting company, Groundwire. In addition to our floppy, blue tent and a few too-sturdy-for-lugging-around folding tables, we had a pour-over station, and we - very slowly - brewed coffee for strangers. The response was incredible. In fact there was one Saturday we couldn't make it to market because of something trivial like someone getting married. During the ceremony - riveting as it was - I couldn't help but notice that Groundwire's social media had received several messages from caffeine deficient market-goers, the subject matter ranging from sadface emojis to borderline death threats. By the end of that first season it was clear that we had met many new friends who believed in what we were doing and encouraged us to take it further. The seed was planted. </p><p>By the summer of 2018,  Carrissa Glarner (Salto Coffee Works, UP Coffee Roasters) and Tim Hollinger (Brick Oven Bakery, Dogwood Coffee Co.) came on board. As the story goes, the four of us became an unstoppable, coffee-slingin’, joy-bringin’ force, who would stop at nothing to make someone's day. And it made our collective day as well - having the chance to serve the coffees we'd so carefully sourced, roasted, and prepared ourselves.  Through our time spent at the Riverwalk Market, engaging with the community and hearing your feedback, we realized it was time to do something special. LittleJoy was born. </p><h3><strong>Why We Need Your Help</strong></h3><p>The money from this campaign will go towards the completion of our buildout in the historic John Sitze building in Downtown Northfield, MN. We believe in doing the best you can with what you have, so we’ve done most of the construction ourselves. With no bank loans or outside investors, we’ve put all of our time and money into this project, and we just need a little more help with the finishing touches - some of which include...</p><ul>

It's where we (Caitlyn and I [""I"" being Cody]) launched our roasting company, Groundwire. In addition to our floppy, blue tent and a few too-sturdy-for-lugging-around folding tables, we had a pour-over station, and we - very slowly - brewed coffee for strangers. The response was incredible. In fact there was one Saturday we couldn't make it to market because of something trivial like someone getting married. During the ceremony - riveting as it was - I couldn't help but notice that Groundwire's social media had received several messages from caffeine deficient market-goers, the subject matter ranging from sadface emojis to borderline death threats. By the end of that first season it was clear that we had met many new friends who believed in what we were doing and encouraged us to take it further. The seed was planted. By the summer of 2018,  Carrissa Glarner (Salto Coffee Works, UP Coffee Roasters) and Tim Hollinger (Brick Oven Bakery, Dogwood Coffee Co.) came on board. As the story goes, the four of us became an unstoppable, coffee-slingin’, joy-bringin’ force, who would stop at nothing to make someone's day. And it made our collective day as well - having the chance to serve the coffees we'd so carefully sourced, roasted, and prepared ourselves.  Through our time spent at the Riverwalk Market, engaging with the community and hearing your feedback, we realized it was time to do something special. LittleJoy was born. Why We Need Your HelpThe money from this campaign will go towards the completion of our buildout in the historic John Sitze building in Downtown Northfield, MN. We believe in doing the best you can with what you have, so we’ve done most of the construction ourselves. With no bank loans or outside investors, we’ve put all of our time and money into this project, and we just need a little more help with the finishing touches - some of which include...
unexpected electrical service upgrade
convection oven to fresh bake a certain Dundas bakery's eats and treats
counter tops
payroll to compensate our staff for training
Every investment thus far has been - and will continue to be - aimed at improving the experiences of our guests.  Thank you for reading and may your future be filled with so much LittleJoy--Cody and the Groundwire/LittleJoy Team",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>My name is Matthew Jones. I'm a coffee roaster and cafe owner and operator. I know first hand how hard it is working through the pandemic, dealing with rising labor costs, high turnover rates and increasing real estate costs. </p>
<p>I thought to myself 'How do I and other small coffee shops, pandemic proof our businesses and tackle all of these issues? How do we survive?'</p>
<p>I decided to automate and I want to help other small businesses do the same.</p>

<p><strong><i>""I would love to see barista's become business owners with automation."" - Matthew Jones</i></strong></p>
<p>Robo Esso wants to put automation in the hands of small businesses, not large corporations. We have built a model that accomplishes this by making our robot barista cost less than $90k.</p>
<p>Here's how Robo Esso does it:</p>
<p>We use equipment that's right off the shelf. Instead of investing in engineers to re-invent the wheel, we used equipment that's easily available and affordable.</p>
<p>Robo Esso can potentially use equipment (Ice machine, espresso machine, etc) already in the coffee shop, another cost saver. </p>
<p>The exterior of Robo Esso is customizable. We're currently using reclaimed wood, burning it, and shellacking it. Looks beautiful and it's affordable. We want Robo Esso owners/operators to have a say in what it looks like and be able to show some personality because behind every Robo Esso there's hard working people putting love into their business. </p>
<h3>What stage are we in and what's the plan?</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1595537391/gfadaf25ssu4tsxieavs.jpg"" src="""" style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;""/></p>
<p>We have completed our prototype. Now we're building and programming our go-to market model. We expect it to be done in Fall 2020. Most of our energy right now is focused on cleaning up the robot's programming, designing a new ordering app and building out the exterior. </p>
<p>That's where we need your help! As you can see, Robo Esso looks a bit naked and needs an exterior. </p>

<p>What's different in our go-to market model? Glad you asked!</p>

<p>The covid-19 pandemic has disrupted supply chains almost everywhere. Thousands of pounds of coffee are now stale and undrinkable. </p>
<p>When life gives you gross coffee, you build coffee coffee tables. Well that's what my brother and I did. </p>
<p>We're taking gross stale coffee from local roasters and turning it into coffee coffee tables. This way it's not a total loss for those roasters. </p>

</div></div>","Contactless, Automated, Robot Espresso Bar

 
My name is Matthew Jones. I'm a coffee roaster and cafe owner and operator. I know first hand how hard it is working through the pandemic, dealing with rising labor costs, high turnover rates and increasing real estate costs. 
I thought to myself 'How do I and other small coffee shops, pandemic proof our businesses and tackle all of these issues? How do we survive?'
I decided to automate and I want to help other small businesses do the same.
We're building a go-to market robot espresso bar that's capable of making drinks faster, more accurately, and just as delicious as a human barista. Now we need your help in building out the exterior of our first location!

Robo Esso Difference

 

Open 24/7
Pandemic proof. By being contactless Robo Esso won't get sick or get others sick
 Significantly less labor. Only needs roughly 2 hours per day for cleaning and re-stocking
Small footprint, only 48 square feet!
Fun and entertaining to watch Robo Esso make drinks
Specialty coffee shop quality
Robo Esso is over $100,000 less expensive than other coffee robots

 

 
Robo Esso is Perfect for...

Coffee shops 
Hotels 
Hospitals 
Airports 
Malls 
Grocery stores 
Large office buildings/complex 
Drive thru's and much more. 

 

We Want to Make Automation Affordable For Small Businesses

""I would love to see barista's become business owners with automation."" - Matthew Jones
Robo Esso wants to put automation in the hands of small businesses, not large corporations. We have built a model that accomplishes this by making our robot barista cost less than $90k.
Here's how Robo Esso does it:
We use equipment that's right off the shelf. Instead of investing in engineers to re-invent the wheel, we used equipment that's easily available and affordable.
Robo Esso can potentially use equipment (Ice machine, espresso machine, etc) already in the coffee shop, another cost saver. 
The exterior of Robo Esso is customizable. We're currently using reclaimed wood, burning it, and shellacking it. Looks beautiful and it's affordable. We want Robo Esso owners/operators to have a say in what it looks like and be able to show some personality because behind every Robo Esso there's hard working people putting love into their business. 
What stage are we in and what's the plan?

We have completed our prototype. Now we're building and programming our go-to market model. We expect it to be done in Fall 2020. Most of our energy right now is focused on cleaning up the robot's programming, designing a new ordering app and building out the exterior. 
That's where we need your help! As you can see, Robo Esso looks a bit naked and needs an exterior. 

What's different in our go-to market model? Glad you asked!

Larger tap setup for more milks, cold brew and kombucha.
More powder flavor possibilities.
Contactless delivery via conveyor belt. 
Brand new ordering app that's flexible and scalable. 



The Team


Buy Our Coffee & Tea = Funding Our Project

Coffee: Buffawhale coffee is organically grown and is better than fair trade. We work with farmers from all over the world. Most of our clients are hotels and restaurants but since the pandemic our business has dropped by 80%. Currently you can only get Buffawhale coffee by funding the Robo Esso project!
Tea: Our very own tea specialist is curating a unique package of 5 different teas and blends. Our teas are not only delicious but also good for you.
The Coffee Coffee Table. A coffee table made from coffee!


The covid-19 pandemic has disrupted supply chains almost everywhere. Thousands of pounds of coffee are now stale and undrinkable. 
When life gives you gross coffee, you build coffee coffee tables. Well that's what my brother and I did. 
We're taking gross stale coffee from local roasters and turning it into coffee coffee tables. This way it's not a total loss for those roasters. 

These tables are pretty amazing and if your ""coffee table"" at home isn't made from coffee then it's NOT a ""coffee table"". Call it a...
Short table in front of couch table
Water table
Beer and wine table
Rest your feet table
Call it whatever but don't call it a ""coffee table"" unless it's made out of coffee. 
If you're disturbed that your ""coffee table"" isn't made of real coffee then we have the solution for you! Get yourself a hand made, unique coffee coffee table. Made out of coffee and reclaimed wood, it's gorgeous and mesmerizing to stare into the sea of coffee beans that make up your entire table!

My name is Chris and am a Naples Native!</p><p>I have played in every aspect of a kitchen over the past 20 years from dishwasher to Executive Chef and have been in everything from a southern style diner to high end fine dining. As you may have noticed. I said play... NOT work.. Why you may ask? Well let me explain! I believe that if you absolutely love what you do and are passionate about it, then it is not work. A kitchen to me is the same as a playground to a 10 year old. I walk in and my eyes light up!</p><p>     I am at my point in my career that I believe I am ready to have my own operation as well I am to that point in my life where I want to go back to the true basics. although I have done many things in the kitchen world and got to play with all kinds of crazy ingredients, my heart lies with BBQ.  There is just something so enjoyable in watching the fire and smoke do their thing. At Gator Creek BBQ Co. our main focus is BBQ. I believe the one mistake a lot of supposed BBQ places do is that they over extend them selves and lose the focus of BBQ. I believe in small menu with the entire focus of BBQ and BBQ accompaniments is a necessity for GREAT BBQ and that is exactly what we are striving for.  Gator Creek BBQ Co. will be a takeout and delivery based restaurant with a small  retail area. In this day and age I am a firm believer that the restaurant industry will change and it will change in this direction.</p><p>     Contributing to this would be not only helping me accomplish a life long goal in a field that I have given my heart and soul to over the past two decades, but it will also be helping me build a legacy that I can pass down to my sons and hopefully to future generations as well as to give an outlet that can help me give back to the wonderful community around us!</p><p> </p><p>THE BREAKDOWN</p><p>I am asking for $175,000. This will go toward equipment costs, start up supplies, marketing and social media marketing, online order app, website, 1 year of rent, 1 year of employee pay, and to help with the first year of bills. The first year is always the biggest hardest year due to the many aspects that need to get honed and focused in on.  </p><p>As a perk for helping achieve the goal. Gator Creek BBQ Co. have a tiered discount program for those who donate once we open the doors to show my appreciation of you generosity.</p><p>Weather or not we reach our goal, we will open.

People have many choices when it comes to eating somewhere, so if you do not put your heart and soul into the food and your quality is not at the level it needs to be then people will notice and you won't make it.</p><p>What makes us different you may ask? Why take the risk? Well, I have had over 20 years in the restaurant industry and all of it has been in the same area. Not only have I worked in the same area for over 20 years, but I also grew up here as well. due to this, I know the demographics, I have many connections and avenues I can market toward. Another factor that will lead to us being successful is that I am a chef and really, truly have a passion for food and to be the best I can be. I am not looking to become rich off of this by any means. I believe that a lot of restaurants especially the bigger ones lose heart and the owners push and push to make more and more money this leads to the restaurant cutting corners and lowering quality of product while over charging in order to please the owners pocket. This is not me by any means. I want to be successful, give my children something for the future, have fun and deliver amazing food to amazing people. </p><p>My plans to be successful are quite simple. The biggest factor in success in minimizing or eliminating loans so that we are able to save as much gross profit as possible which will allow for hard marketing, social media marketing, promotions, and a ""survival piggy bank"" for when we are out of season, times get tough or something needs repairing etc. This is the main reason I am asking for donations. You all will be a huge factor in making sure Glades BBQ Co. is a successful business! Secondly, is quality quality quality. We will deliver the highest quality we possibly can while giving true southern hospitality to our guests. At Gator Creek BBQ Co., the guests are number one. I firmly believe that if you keep them happy then they will take care of you. When it comes down to it, its really all about the people right? Why do I cook? Because I enjoy making people happy.

Lastly, My vast network of people will be my final secret weapon on the way to success and BBQ greatness! One fantastic thing about working and growing up in the same area especially an area like this is that people will gather around you and help you. Everyone wants you to succeed even you competition.

<h3>Oh, you guys have been working on this thing for a while, right?</h3>
<p>Yes.  About 3 years.  It's been like aging a fine barley wine. </p>
<p>Greg is the founder and head brewer.  He's been making beer for about 10 years now and has been solely responsible for making the beer, packaging the beer, and cleaning up after the beer.   He's had a lot of help building the taproom and brewery, as well as serving the beer.  Thanks to all their love and support, our taproom is finished, our beer lines are clean, and yeast has been pitched.  </p>
<p>This is a pretty small operation at the moment; our current equipment produces about 2 barrels per batch and our goal is to brew about 10 barrels per week.  We are raising money to bring on 3-5 employees to help Greg in the brewery and taproom.  We would like to bring this team together by the grand opening on Friday, July 13th.  </p>
<h3>What kind of beer do you make?</h3>
<p>Using a mixed culture of lively yeast strains, we produce unique and complex session ales that are typically 5% abv and under.  We offer five flagship beers, three rotating seasonals, and other specialties.  Some are hoppy, some are sour, and some taste like a sourdough pretzel.  BeeBoy's honey makes incredible braggot.  Then there are a few others based on 5,000 year old beer recipes.  What does that mean?  You'll have to come visit us for a taste. </p>
<h3>What do you need and what do I get?</h3>
<p>We are looking to hire two part time brewing assistants to help with day-to-day operations.  This includes brewing beer, packaging beer, and cleaning equipment.  We will need an additional one to two motivated individuals to work front-of-house during taproom hours and events. </p>
<p>To help raise funds for expanding our team, we are offering fancy glassware, soft t-shirts, and an invitation to an exclusive pre-launch party on July 7th, 2018.  Guests will be able to sample five of our beers alongside a pairing of Pennsylvania-made potato chips and pretzels.   The Asado Food truck will also be open!</p>

<h3>Where is this place?</h3>
<p>1958 Varley St., Pittsburgh PA, 15207.  We are located in a 100 year old building that was formerly known as the Workingmen's Beneficial Union.  This was a social hall that included a bar, bowling alley, billiards, and a ball room.  Our taproom and brewery now occupy just a piece of this expansive building.  <br/><br/>Unfortunately the building suffered a lot of abuse from the elements for 15 years after it closed.  </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

<p>Producing 10 barrels of beer per week on our small brewing system is ambitious and will require a lot of dedicated work.  We hope to upgrade our brewing system as soon as possible, increasing our capacity but also our labor needs.  As we grow we seek to establish an enthusiastic core team early to ensure our long term success and to help keep the beer flowing. </p>

<p><strong>OUR STORY</strong></p>
<p>The story of Trouvaille Brewing Company (pronounced /tro͞oˈvī/) is really the story of four different breweries; Congressional Brewing, 2327 Brewing, Happy Hound Brewing, and Alba Garage Brewing. These home breweries have served as the incubator for the passion for great beer that we will bring to the Northern Virginia area. We honed our recipes in our garages, and over the past five years have produced a level of quality we believe will set us apart in a market that primed for more great beer. Our beer has won over 100 individual awards and garnered critical acclaim at both the regional and national level. We have perfected our craft, and are ready to bring our vision to Town of Haymarket</p>
<ul>
<li>Our ownership group brings a unique collection of skills to the Northern Virginia brewing scene, including management, engineering, and most importantly, award-winning brewing experience.</li>
<li>We are a team of 5 experienced homebrewers with over 100 individual medals in competitions ranging from local to the national level.</li>
<li>We have ample operations management experience, with an MBA and PMP certifications.</li>
<li>The craft beer industry is a close one, built on community. We will coordinate closely and have the support of local breweries, ensuring a welcoming environment for our new business.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>** IMPORTANT NOTE **</strong></p>
<p>Annual and Lifetime Mug Club memberships are for the member and spouse. While only one piece of apparel will be selected, all discounts and related event perks will apply to both.</p>

<p>We are a group of five friends with a passion for great beer. We have a vision for an incredible craft beer experience, and we need your help to make it a reality. Opening a brewery is an expensive endeavor, and while we have put together a considerable portion of the necessary funds we want to involve our craft beer community to raise an additional amount we believe will ensure we can get from build out to opening day.</p>
<p>We know our community embraces small business, and truly values great craft beer. We are opening up our Mug Club to certain tiers, for either one year ($100) or lifetime memberships ($500), and even an opportunity to conceptualize, design, brew, and name your own beer that will be served in the taproom ($1000).

<h3>Hey ya'll! My names Kali, but I bet we've met!</h3>
<p>My back story with Neon Moon is one of chance, vision, and perseverance.</p>
<p>It all started nearly a year ago, when I walked into the building that would become the home of my honky tonk dreams, and I didn't even know it. I came on as design consultant on a bar project led by a few friends and over the last year, I've ended up the last one standing. What brought me here is very important to my personal development, but it is a long and tiresome tale. One day, you can come sit on the other side of my bar and I'll tell you all about it.</p>
<p>Since that first moment inside the building that would become Neon Moon, there's been such incredible parallel growth within the space and my knowledge of what it takes to not only open a business, but repurpose a one-hundred year old saw mill. It's hell, but I'm cultivating a legacy that I hope will benefit my community and continue on long after I'm gone.</p>
<p>After the initial loan and investor, it became clear that the scope of the undertaking was larger, monetarily, than I imagined it would be. My loaners have agreed to increase my loan for the bar, but the reason you're reading this is because this gal needs some working capital to pay the bills in the final months before I can open my doors to you lovely critters. </p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this. I've been typing through tears of gratitude and strength to get to the end here.</p>
<p>Shout out to my family, blood and chosen. Shout out to the ones who truly believe in this dream with me. Thank you Mom, I love you.</p>

No more getting up to get a fresh beer because yours in warm. Save those steps for the fitness freaks.Beer Buddy 3D printed Prototype in direct sunlight outlasting a can with the same starting temperature by over 15.5°F / 8.6°CTHE PROBLEM:You know the pains of warm beer. So well, that you tell yourself you like the taste. No, you've probably never said that. Sure, you could buy a $35 beer insulator, a $25 can insulator, another $20 can insulator because you want to try those fancy skinny cans, and a $30 tumbler to pour liquid into. That's a costly $110 just because they want to sell you more! More! More! WARNING - SHOCKING FACT: A beer goes warm every 2.7 seconds from neglect. Don't let this happen to you.So, ask yourself: Do I really want to pay $110 when I can get an all-in-one Beer Buddy?If you already have one, we know you settled for your current beverage insulator. That's Okay. They sucker you in with their fancy branding. But we have that too ;)You can say goodbye to warm beer forever!Do any of these look familiar? Point to the one you have. Now get your filthy fingers off your screen.We have solved all the problems with these insulators and made the beverage insulator of your dreams. Seriously, this thing rocks.The biggest issue with current beverage insulators are that you need to buy at least 4 of them to do one job. On top of that, you have to deal with a number of additional problems. •They break easily. •They don't work as advertised.  •They claim to be ""leak proof"" but just aren't.  •They aren't a Beer Buddy. •Why do you deal with this? Because there's no other option!THE SOLUTION:Beer Buddy is the all-in-one solution to your problems. Beer Buddy fits bottles, cans, skinny cans, and can even be used as a tumbler to keep liquid cold or hot. You no longer need 4 devices to keep your drink cold. Free up your cabinet space and your headache. Beer Buddy has arrived!We could list over 1,000 beers that it fits, but lets make this simple:Example of some bottles that fit in Beer Buddy.If it's a pretty normal 12oz glass beer bottle, it fits. If it's pretty close to normal, it also fits. Honestly, if it's a bottle, there's a very good chance it fits.If it's a 12oz can, it probably fits. Doesn't matter if it's normal, tall, skinny or in-between.If it's liquid, it'll fit. 16oz of it. Cold as the Ice Age, or Hot as molten lava (we'll maybe not that hot).How is Beer Buddy constructed?Simply put, Beer Buddy is made of stainless steel and has double vacuum sealed walls. The final version of Beer Buddy will pass FDA and prop 65 testing.Ready for some more good news!?Beer Buddy is super cup holder friendly. Beer Buddy will fit the most common cup holders. Whether you're drinking and driving your car, boat or jet, Beer Buddy has you covered.DISCLAIMER: DON'T DRINK AND DRIVEBeer Buddy comes to you from the guys who brought you Grill Rescue. The World's Best Grill Brush. Seems like we're full of world's best, huh?Grill Rescue truly is the greatest grill brush and we proved this by completing a Indiegogo campaign raising over $270,000 going on to sell millions shortly thereafter. So, why Indiegogo? We learned that this is by far the best platform to bring new product to life and give people the opportunity to help back this project at a discount. Grill Rescue sold on Indiegogo for less than half of it's current retail price. The discounts on Indiegogo are no joke. THE PROCESS:Designing the world's best beverage insulator was very difficult. Wanting something better than what's currently on the market is easy, creating it is hard. It took over a year to design and create the perfect version of Beer Buddy. Take a look below and get a 30 second view of the last year creating the perfect version of Beer Buddy.3D CAD Drawings used for design and prototypingMeasuring bottles for interior fitment tiersSome of the first Beer Buddy 3D printed prototypesWe created Beer Buddy out of frustration of companies trying to sell you 4 insulators when we knew just one could do the job of all 4. They know this, and we know this.

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>Rough Waters Brewing Company is a nanobrewery located in Deer Lake, NL. Currently, the brewery location offers bottles to purchase for take-away consumption with the goal of opening a taproom where people can drink pints of beer in the Summer(ish) of 2020. In the short time the brewery has been open, Rough Waters Brewing has received great reviews and numerous requests from restaurants, hospitality businesses and Newfoundland Liquor Corporation locations across the province to have our beer offered. We are grateful for this, but what we aim to provide is a unique taproom experience to the town of Deer Lake while being a force for good in our province and community. Our plan is to open a taproom in the spring through reinvestment from bottles sales. This Indiegogo campaign is to help bring you that taproom sooner while offering some awesome perks! The name ""Rough Waters"" resonates with Newfoundlanders and Labradoreans to represent the resilience and perseverance of the province and the people who call it home.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1580824083/jnq0l215vkso4sdfz8uv.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Currently, we operate a 3BBL brewhouse with everything bottled in 500mL bottles.</p>
<p>Both Chris (Head Brewer) and Jennie (Business Development) have been overwhelmed with the support of the town, locals and other businesses and want to bring a taproom to the local community. It's no secret that NL has been struggling economically, but that doesn't mean quality has to struggle with it. People still want to go out, do something nice, enjoy a great beer with an equally great atmosphere and have a clean and friendly place to relax at the end of a long week. We want to bring that to our community!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1580824177/aupy51ed3d8fsg7erzpg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Where the seats for the taproom will be located!</p>
<p>Rough Waters Brewing Company is a socially responsible and innovative company. We will continue to buy as much as possible locally. This means more money stays within the province (or Country), every dollar spent generates twice as much income for the local economy. Our clothing merchandise is all made in Canada and sourced from a company in Montreal which is knit, dyed, cut and sewn on Canadian soil. The conditions of foreign factories are deplorable and the wages of their employees are dreadful and it's not something that we, as a company, want to support or be a part of. Our grains go to a local dairy farmer in Deer Lake who collects the spent grain and uses it as feed for the cows. Rough Waters works hard to bring a sense of belonging to the community. We plan on continuing to offer monthly markets which helps promote local artisans while giving back to local charities at the same time.</p>

<p>At our very first market, we were able to raise over $450 for the Islaview Foundation!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are currently producing beer in 500mL bottles only. Your support will help us provide a unique brewery and taproom experience for locals and travelers to Deer Lake, NL. We are lucky enough to have received great responses to our beer, but everyone asks us ""when are you going to open a taproom?"" We want to open one up today! That's why we want to provide you guys with first dibs on some amazing perks and help us get there quicker! We need funding for:</p>

<li>Tables and Chairs</li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Rough Waters Brewing Company will open a Taproom a we meet our fundraising goal. The purpose of this campaign is to try and get there quicker and let you be a part of making that happen while receiving some amazing perks!</p>
<p>We started this journey 3 years ago. We have learned a lot in those 3 years, we are grateful that everything finally worked out and we were able to achieve what we did. We worked through all the hurdles and built the brewery with our own hands. There are only two of us in the business! We started this when we were 25 years old, people come in and ask ""where are the owners?"" or ""how old are you?"" which we get, we look 15 (Chris maybe looks 18 thanks to the beard). I guess what we're trying to say is this has been a longgg road and we're tapped out (pun intended). We appreciate your past (and future) support!</p>
<p>Thanks to all of our customers who have helped bring us to where we are now. We have an incredible group of friends in the NL craft beer community and look forward to a long and prosperous future with everyone!</p>

Our plan is to open a taproom in the spring through reinvestment from bottles sales. This Indiegogo campaign is to help bring you that taproom sooner while offering some awesome perks! The name ""Rough Waters"" resonates with Newfoundlanders and Labradoreans to represent the resilience and perseverance of the province and the people who call it home.

Currently, we operate a 3BBL brewhouse with everything bottled in 500mL bottles.
Both Chris (Head Brewer) and Jennie (Business Development) have been overwhelmed with the support of the town, locals and other businesses and want to bring a taproom to the local community. It's no secret that NL has been struggling economically, but that doesn't mean quality has to struggle with it. People still want to go out, do something nice, enjoy a great beer with an equally great atmosphere and have a clean and friendly place to relax at the end of a long week. We want to bring that to our community!

Where the seats for the taproom will be located!
Rough Waters Brewing Company is a socially responsible and innovative company. We will continue to buy as much as possible locally. This means more money stays within the province (or Country), every dollar spent generates twice as much income for the local economy. Our clothing merchandise is all made in Canada and sourced from a company in Montreal which is knit, dyed, cut and sewn on Canadian soil. The conditions of foreign factories are deplorable and the wages of their employees are dreadful and it's not something that we, as a company, want to support or be a part of. Our grains go to a local dairy farmer in Deer Lake who collects the spent grain and uses it as feed for the cows. Rough Waters works hard to bring a sense of belonging to the community. We plan on continuing to offer monthly markets which helps promote local artisans while giving back to local charities at the same time.

At our very first market, we were able to raise over $450 for the Islaview Foundation!

What We Need & What You Get
We are currently producing beer in 500mL bottles only. Your support will help us provide a unique brewery and taproom experience for locals and travelers to Deer Lake, NL. We are lucky enough to have received great responses to our beer, but everyone asks us ""when are you going to open a taproom?"" We want to open one up today! That's why we want to provide you guys with first dibs on some amazing perks and help us get there quicker! We need funding for:

Draft System
Kegs
Tables and Chairs
Speakers/Sound System
Glassware
Dishwasher


Day One! Summer 2019.
If you would love to see a Rough Waters Brewery Taproom sooner rather than later, then help us out! Love craft beer?? Want to see it grow in our beautiful province? Plus receive some amazing perks for doing so! Well this is going to be VERY exciting!!
 

Risks & Challenges
Rough Waters Brewing Company will open a Taproom a we meet our fundraising goal. The purpose of this campaign is to try and get there quicker and let you be a part of making that happen while receiving some amazing perks!
We started this journey 3 years ago. We have learned a lot in those 3 years, we are grateful that everything finally worked out and we were able to achieve what we did. We worked through all the hurdles and built the brewery with our own hands. There are only two of us in the business! We started this when we were 25 years old, people come in and ask ""where are the owners?"" or ""how old are you?"" which we get, we look 15 (Chris maybe looks 18 thanks to the beard). I guess what we're trying to say is this has been a longgg road and we're tapped out (pun intended). We appreciate your past (and future) support!
Thanks to all of our customers who have helped bring us to where we are now. We have an incredible group of friends in the NL craft beer community and look forward to a long and prosperous future with everyone!

The best balance between sharpness and durability actually depends on complicating match-ups of many factors; steel materials and hardness (also match-ups of heat treatment temperatures for hardness determination), edge angles, and blade thickness and so on.           From our long experience of knife production, we have been experimenting thousands of blade profiles and finally created an incredibly sharp and durable blade.           3 essential knives, Chef knife 20cm, Slicer knife 25cm and Petty knife 15cm, are in our collection.  The blade material is clad steel of SG2, Powdered steel, for cutting core. It is the newer and better steel than VG-10, produced by the same alloy manufacturer in Japan. Powder metallurgy Super fine (nano) powder of steel elements are compressed, heated and formed into ingots. This is a totally different alloy production process from the ordinary “melting process”. This special process enables a powered steel to contain much more key elements for better quality than melting-processed steel.          Fine metallographic image Better quality than VG-10 from the same alloy manufacturer VG-10 Japanese steel is currently used for the most of high quality kitchen knives in the market. Look around the other projects of successful kitchen knife on Indiegogo, they all use VG-10 stainless steel for their knife. SG2 powdered steel has been developed newly as the updated and better performance steel than VG-10 by the same manufacturer of VG-10 in Japan. SG2 actually contains 30% more of Carbon than VG-10 which decides steel hardness, 230% more of Molybdenum which contributes to anti-corrosion, and 570% more of Vanadium which contributes to sharpness durability.        This new material enables our knife to take and hold an exquisitely fine edge with long lasting sharpness. Take a look at a test result below compared to VG-10 knife and AUS-10 knife.Paper cutting test for sharpness and durability definition Comparison between SG2, VG-10 and AUS-10 Production difficulty However, it requires high techniques during knife production to draw a powder steel nature and its greatness. Therefore, not many manufacturers can carry this high level steel for their knives. Right now, only a few world major knife brands use this powder steel for their premium products that are sold at their highest price range, more than USD300 (MSRP).           Our in-house well-skilled craftsmen add the edge on the blade, every single piece by hand.The traditional “Honbazuke” horning technique is applied. The edge is tapered to a 15 degree blade angle to make sure the knife is razor-sharp.       Hybrid of Western and EasternBlade shape is combination of Japanese and western cutlery culture. Japanese traditional “Kiritsuke” tip enables you to fillet fish and meat easily because the tip goes into sharply. Blade width is more Western, it is wider so that your hand doesn’t touch the board when you cut. We know that many people complain that their hands touch the cutting board when they use Japanese knife because it is relatively narrower than western knives.          Not too thick, not too slim, gently curved handle is comfortable to grab. There are grooves on the handle so you can hook your fingers for perfect fit.Handle material is Walnut-colored Pakkawood. Pakkawood is combination of wood material and resin compressed. It is better than natural wood handle in terms of shrinkage and durability. While natural wood handle tends to change color and its surface to become rough, pakkawood handle is more durable against those changes. It will even transform to fit to your palm gradually while you use the knife.           Brass bolster takes on a patina over time to a more chic, shabby and antique look. So, the knife will become your own and favorite one through years just like an old friend.           The balanced blade and handle weight provides you a comfortable and confident feel in your hand.          We would like our knives to be used for a long time. Especially, this high quality knife has a potential to be your life-lasting knife as long as it is taken care well. We prepared a knife care kit that enables you to maintain the sharpness and also to protect from rust. Sharpening stone : Combination of 1000/3000 grits. Space saving double sides sharpening stone enables you to maintain knife sharpness. Angle keeper for sharpening with stone : For those who never used stones for sharpening, this angle keeper helps you maintain proper angle of the blade applying to the stone by simply attaching it to the knife spine.Rust eraser : It is important to take an action immediately when the knife got a spot of rust in order to prevent it from spreading. This rust eraser removes rust easily so you can keep the knife at good condition for a long time.All the accessories including one chef knife are set into a gorgeous wooden storage box. Design is inspired from a cigar box which is an icon of the time when you enjoy yourself. We hope you can enjoy treating and maintaining the knife with our knife care set. With this set, our knife can be a great gift for someone special to you.          We, SUNCRAFT, are kitchen knife manufacturer in Seki city, Japan. The company has been established in 1948 and since then, we have been producing kitchen knives for more than 60 years. All of our craftsmen in-house are well-experienced and specialists of each procedure of making knives that add up to 30 steps.       Seki city, Japan where we are located Seki city, Japan is globally famous of making knives. Its history of knife production has begun about 800 years ago when Samurai sword (battle sword) forging had flourished there. Throughout centuries, knife making tradition has been taken over to generations and it remains on kitchen knives today. Samurai sword forged in Seki city, Japan How we got here We have sketched tons of blade shapes and handle design to pursue our ideal knife and to maximize the used material features. We have made many of mock-ups to see if our idea actually corresponds with what we think the best. The last 10 months have been spent on testing the one we have ended up lastly and the knife has finally become what we cannot improve more.       Timeline AUG. 2018  Campaign ends AUG. 2018  Material preparation SEP. 2018  Production starts OCT. 2018 Production completes & Start delivery Risks and challengesThe funding raised through Indiegogo will be used to purchase materials.

<h3><u>Superfood Not Candy</u></h3>
<p>Thanks for checking out our Indiegogo campaign! We're Christian and Christelle, a new farm to bar chocolate maker couple, based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. In the past years, Manitoba is becoming a premier travel destination and the new Lonely Planet list of Best places to travel in 2019 is just a proof of that. We want to make Manitoba a chocolate destination!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><u><strong>FARM TO BAR CHOCOLATES</strong></u></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>After being in Winnipeg for a few years, we started looking for a wholesome chocolate and couldn't find anything locally. With our connections back in Cameroon, we invested in a cacao farm with the help of our family there. Now, we get to control the quality of the beans we grow and don’t have to worry about Fairtrade conditions since it’s a small family operated farm. We visit the farm a few times per year especially during harvest season. After harvest, the beans are fermented then we ship them to Manitoba. In our open concept store, we sort, roast, crack, winnow, grind, refine, conch, age, temper, then mould and hands wrap our chocolates. The result is a luxurious chocolate, made without additives, using the highest quality ingredients, a rich and virtuous chocolate. The support we received after attending a few local events motivated us to work harder and open a store in order to be able to share our passion and knowledge with a broader community.</p>
<p>Over the past almost two years since opening our store, we have worked very hard to craft chocolate that meets these standards. Along the way, we have also continued to learn, experiment and taste to increase our understanding of chocolate and chocolate making. This knowledge has led us to improve our process resulting in even better chocolate.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong><u>HOW CAN YOU HELP &amp; WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU?</u></strong></h3>
<p>We are looking to get one tempering machine and one melanger.</p>
<ul>
<li>We will always be a humbly-minded local business, and we will always be closely involved in the process. But at the same time we want to grow and expand across the Prairies as more specialty stores, boutiques and shops want to carry our products. We love it that our chocolate makes people happy! </li>
<li>If we go from one big melanger to two or more machines, we can make all two or more varieties at once instead of one at a time. We won't have to work all night to get the chocolate tempered, hand-wrapped, and shipped to the stores on time. </li>
</ul>
<p>Lately, we have been receiving phone calls and emails from people across the country who want our chocolate. In order to continue sharing our bars with more people, we need your help! </p>
<ul><li>We wish to raise enough money to purchase a larger, more advanced tempering machine. This machine has the ability to temper 16Kg of chocolate, or 228 regular bars per hour and can deposit the appropriate amount of chocolate into each mold. Currently, we are limited by a machine that only allows us to temper 1kg of chocolate or 22 regular bars every two hours and a half and requires us to manually pour the chocolate into each mold. With this new machine, we can increase the efficiency and scale of our production, allowing us to meet the growing demand, expand our line of organic products and continue to share our passion for fine, handmade chocolate that is good to us and to the Earth.</li></ul>

<p>I am Aaron Pratt. For the last two years, I have run a mobile pizza oven business, called Rotelle pizza. I make the best Neapolitan style pizza I can with ingredients sourced from North Carolina. Now, I've found a brick and mortar location to make pizza, as part of a larger convenience store and service station. Just like the community stores of old, you can come by C&amp;B, fill up your farm equipment with ethanol free gasoline or off road diesel, pick up produce from local farmers, and grab a wood fired pizza to go! We believe in a community based agricultural system, and are looking to work with the farmers of Orange County to bring our community better food.</p>
<p>The money raised by this campaign is directly benefiting our infrastructure upfit. Our building will need water fed from a farm next door, and we will need a water tower to fill it. All money from this campaign will go toward purchasing a 5000 gallon water tank for our water tower, and any left over will go to finishing our inside renovations.</p>
<p>This will lay the foundation for a great business in the community of Cedar Grove, adding jobs and food to a very rural area.</p>

What we need

This project is about supporting the local farmers in Crete and enriching the German market with loose leaf, special herbs.
Furthermore, we want to bring new blends to the market. One part of the costs have been already covered by ourselves (product development, advertisement, If we get to the funding verge, we can produce new, biodegradable packages, implement more intensive our sustainable goals and begin with the production of our new tea variety. We plan to get the Vegan Certification as well as to find green logistic partners. Our goal is also to bring our teas out in liquid form in glass bottles, which is difficult to realize at the moment.
We already have already mastered the organic certification and have produced and filled up professionally the first batches!Help us to produce more wonderful mixes!
 
RISKS AND CHALLENGES

As a small pure online business (currently only on instagram: @teasntrees), we have been facing many challenges everyday, including lack of stock area and manpower. So, we need your help to get this done and help us get into mass production stage. Our backers can get super discount for return.
We are committed to continuing to source only the highest quality ingredients to create our blends in order to meet supply and demand and a growing interest in organic products. We will continue to source ethically grown, organic and wild crafted herbs from Crete to ensure we have the highest quality tea with therapeutic benefits and exquisite flavors.
Our team is passionate about tea and creating not only a lifestyle, but improved quality of life through happiness and improved health.
If time and resources become an issue we will source a bigger space to allow quicker production and larger quantities as well as creating more exquisite blends throughout the process.

<p>The drip tower method of making cold brew coffee is the process of slowly dripping water onto a bed of coffee over a period of 2-3 hours. This extracts a flavour that doesn’t have the usual bitterness you expect from a cup of hot coffee, instead your patience is rewarded with a rich, sweet, fruity body and smooth aftertaste.

<p class=""p2"">We all like ice cream, so why should those who like a particular flavour miss out on all the fun? The Ice Cream Truck of Love is a non-political, areligious campaign to raise awareness for marriage equality in Australia.</p>
<p class=""p2"">The Senate is currently evaluating its stance on same-sex marriage in Australia, though, we believe this decision belongs with you. Our aim is to send our truck around the country offering ice cream and positive support of marriage equality, all with a simple message: Everyone deserves the opportunity to marry the person they love, no matter the flavour.</p>
<h2 class=""p1""><strong>What We Plan On Doing</strong></h2>
<p class=""p2"">Starting in Sydney, working its way up to Brisbane and then back down the Australian eastern seaboard, the Ice Cream Truck of Love will appear in highly-frequented areas such as city centres, sporting venues and popular landmarks to spread the message to the real people of Australia. In exchange for ice cream, the public can learn how they can become involved in righting the country's stance on same-sex marriage.</p>
<h2 class=""p1""><strong>How We Plan On Doing It</strong></h2>
<p class=""p2"">Through the generous support of financial contribution and pro bono services from our corporate partners, we hope to raise sufficient funds to see the Ice Cream Truck of Love's roadtip realised. Anything above our target will go back into the campaign in order to visit other capital cities and regional centres.</p>
<h2 class=""p1""><strong>How We'll Use Your Donation</strong></h2>
<p class=""p2"">Your kind donation will go directly to funding the Ice Cream Truck of Love and its operation. This will involve leasing and transporting the ice cream truck, hiring of promotional and security staff, insurance, printing of promotional material and accomodation of our Ice Cream Truck of Love team. We appreciate your generosity and in turn will give you our complete commitment to the cause.</p>
<h2 class=""p1""><strong>Why We're Doing It</strong></h2>
<p class=""p2"">We believe it's time this country revisited its outmoded stance on marriage equality. It has nothing to do with religion, nor should be paired with a certain party's political agenda—we just want a basic human right to be offered to everyone.</p>

Blends will also be available and will be updated frequently.  A variety of extracts will be aged in store and bottled upon request for peak freshness.  While in the shop take in all of the sights and smells of the various products and their uses.  Books and hot teas are available for the customers while they wait, or if one simply wants to stop by and enjoy the atmosphere.   The Background...This journey has been about a year in the making.  I've created, thrown out, and re-created a business plan.  I've had success in crafting blends, and total fails as well.  I've vended at networking events and vendor markets.  I've even built a nice little following of customers who are cheering all along the way.  Now it is time to tap into some more funds. What Does The SpiceShip Need?What The SpiceShip needs now is $10k to make sure the first year is a success.  Statistically the first year makes or breaks new businesses.  With ten grand the chance for longevity will be much greater.   Here's a breakdown of how the resources will be utilized:
$6k will pay for half a year of rent up front.  This way the profits that are made during these months will be set aside for an emergency fund and a bank for potential replacement costs.
$1k is designated for décor and equipment.  
$1k  is needed for a year of business insurance and to help with the cost of a business accountant
$1k is for stock and packaging supplies.
$1k is designated for help with advertising, signage, and media.

Applying seasonings to the outside does not season the inside and it can burn during cooking.  This can create bad tastes.
Seasoning on the outside falls off, burns and does not penetrate.  
 Seasoning applied to the outside of meat often ends up in the pan or on the grill and what does stick can burn sometimes causing bad flavors.Seasoning Problem Two:
Marinates are messy, time consuming and don't really work. 
Food scientists call it the Myth of Marinade.  Truth is marinades barely penetrate meat.  
Commercial marinates are really unhealthy and full of high fructose corn syrup, sodium and chemicals.   Yuck!
Marinades are messy, time consuming and many are filled with unhealthy ingredients like high fructose corn syrup and preservatives. Seasoning Stixs season meat, fish and poultry from the inside out helping you create delicious dishes for yourself, friends and family.The fact is that meat fibers are mainly water and all that water is simply in the way.  Until some of that water is displaced, nothing is going to season meat properly.  Seasoning Stixs are solid seasonings and spices, which are inserted into meat prior to cooking.  At approximately 110F the sticks begin to liquify allowing the meat fibers to absorb all the seasoning goodness as the water is displaced, effectively seasoning and marinading from the inside out.Making delicious meat, fish and poultry with Seasoning Stixs is really simple:
Select you favorite Seasoning Stix blend
Insert Stixs into you favorite meat, fish or poultry.  The seasonings travel into the meat up to several inches, so only few Stixs are need for small cuts: insert more for large cuts or for even more flavor.
Cook, Grill, Barbecue, Roast as normal
Enjoy your delicious meal Seasoned From the Inside Out
Using Seasoning Stixs is really easy - 1) Select a Blend, 2) Insert a few Stixs, 3) Cook as Normal, 4) Enjoy Seasoning From the Inside Out. Our Kickstarter backers will receive all four of our initial blends:
Classic Garlic made with Organic California Garlic from the garlic capital of the world, Gilroy, California.
Backyard Barbecue made with honey, brown sugar and classic BBQ seasonings and spices.
Herb de Provence, the classic French culinary seasoning.
Thai Satay, an ambitious blend to help you cook with Thai flavors, but in an entirely new way.
 Classic Garlic will likely be our most popular blend. It is certainly the staff's favorite. Made with Organic California Garlic and a blend of organic seasonings, herb and spices. Wonderful in steaks and chicken. A unique blend enabling you to season with classic BBQ sauce flavors from the inside out. An updated version of the classic French blend for Herb de Provence. Marinades from the inside out with classic French flavors. Enhanced with a dash of organic white turmeric. Peanut butter inside a Stix? YES! - A bold blend with powdered peanut butter and classic Thai flavors that helps you season from the inside out.  Patents in the culinary world are very rare.  Such intellectual property protection takes a considerable time and expense to obtain, but fortunately it is something our team has already completed - A significant achievement. We currently hold three patents on Seasoning Stixs.  These are issued patents; not patents pending, which is super exciting for our growing company.
Seasoning Stick and Method and apparatus for Preparing Foods - A solid seasoning product in the form of a stick, rod, thread, band, bead, pellet or ribbon from 20 mils to 250 mils thick and having a geometry as a shaped mass that enables the product to be inserted into or mixed with food comprising meat, poultry, rice, grains or other particulate foods prior to heating to prepare the food.
Seasoning Device and Method for Preparing Foods - Invention relates to a seasoning device or product, and more particularly to a method for preparing and seasoning foods, especially meats and poultry.  
This will ensure our efforts and your backer money will be  used to produce a product and to help grow a company that will have a secure future.  We also believe these patents will be attractive to established seasoning and spice companies that have seen little product innovation in decades.

<p><strong>Our Story</strong></p>
<p>In 2010, our founder Steffen Johnson, joined the United States Army and shipped from his hometown of Rehoboth, MA to Fort Riley, Kansas. In 2012 Steffen was deployed from Fort Riley, Kansas to serve on an overseas tour in Afghanistan. While pulling guard and having a conversation with one of his buddies, he was asked “what do you want to do after the Army?”. Steffen’s response to this question is what sparked the dream of opening a community-based brewery back in his hometown. Shortly after Steffen’s return he began discussing his dream of going professional with his high school buddy Dan DiRienzo.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Over the following years, Steffen and Dan began to brew and develop recipes while continuing to pursue the dream of one day going commercial with their passion project. After years of searching for the perfect place to call Anawan Brewing Company home, they finally found a place. All the way back in 2012 when Steffen said he wanted “to open a brewery” he had his hometown of Rehoboth, MA in mind as to where he wanted to open. With your help we can bring our dream of over 8 years to fruition in the beautiful, historic town of Rehoboth, MA!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Award Winning Beer</strong></p>
<p>Over the several years that Steffen and Dan have been brewing together they have received multiple medals, awards, and recognition for their quality handcrafted beers. With over 75+ unique beer recipes there is bound to be a beer that everyone can enjoy. ABC is committed to their motto of being “Independent, Handcrafted, and Local”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>From Homebrewing to Commercial</strong></p>
<p>While homebrewing out of our garage has been fun, we are unable to get the beer out to the public. This second, and final campaign will allow us to gather the funds allowing us to open a 1600 square foot brewery and taproom in Rehoboth, MA. We believe through the help of supporters like you we will be able to put Rehoboth on the map as a craft beer destination for years to come.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Community-Based Brewery</strong></p>
<p>The Rehoboth taproom will not only be a place for customers to enjoy beer on-site or to go, but it will be an asset to the town as well. From the beginning of our dream we always stood by the saying of having what we call a “community-based brewery’. To us a community-based brewery is one that will support local business and organizations all through the love of craft beer. We are dedicated to having a positive impact on the community and staying true to our motto of being “Independent, Handcrafted and Local”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Opening Rehoboth’s first brewery and taproom has proven to be no small task, but with your help we can finally make our dreams a reality! Our $17,500+ goal is what we'll need to finish interior construction on our taproom and purchase brewing equipment so we can offer the highest quality beer possible this Fall/Winter 2020. </p>
<p>We greatly appreciate your contributions and will be offering a bunch of great rewards as token of our appreciation. The perks we will be offering are as follows:</p>
<p>- Pint Glasses<br/>- ABC/""Keever"" Artwork &amp; Sticker Pack<br/>- T-Shirts<br/>- Sweatshirts<br/>- Merch bundles<br/>- Barn Raisers Club Membership<br/>- Mug Club Membership<br/>- ""Golden Growler"" Club Membership<br/>- Brew and Name a Beer Party<br/>- Ultimate Founders Party Bundle</p>
<p><strong>Your Impact</strong></p>
<p>The past 8 years have all been leading up to this moment. We have tirelessly searched and finally have a place that we believe will be perfect for the brewery and taproom of our dreams. Your contribution to our project represents a unique opportunity to be a part of something special and extremely impactful.</p>
<p>We want to thank you all for checking our campaign out. If you can't contribute, please consider sharing this with your friends, or family to help us spread the word!</p>
<p>We can never thank you all enough for the never-ending support, and we are working tirelessly to get this place built to serve some amazing beer as soon as possible! Please don't hesitate to contact us with any questions you may have.</p>
<p>Cheers, </p>

Over the following years, Steffen and Dan began to brew and develop recipes while continuing to pursue the dream of one day going commercial with their passion project. After years of searching for the perfect place to call Anawan Brewing Company home, they finally found a place. All the way back in 2012 when Steffen said he wanted “to open a brewery” he had his hometown of Rehoboth, MA in mind as to where he wanted to open. With your help we can bring our dream of over 8 years to fruition in the beautiful, historic town of Rehoboth, MA!
 
Award Winning Beer
Over the several years that Steffen and Dan have been brewing together they have received multiple medals, awards, and recognition for their quality handcrafted beers. With over 75+ unique beer recipes there is bound to be a beer that everyone can enjoy. ABC is committed to their motto of being “Independent, Handcrafted, and Local”.
 
From Homebrewing to Commercial
While homebrewing out of our garage has been fun, we are unable to get the beer out to the public. This second, and final campaign will allow us to gather the funds allowing us to open a 1600 square foot brewery and taproom in Rehoboth, MA. We believe through the help of supporters like you we will be able to put Rehoboth on the map as a craft beer destination for years to come.
 
Community-Based Brewery
The Rehoboth taproom will not only be a place for customers to enjoy beer on-site or to go, but it will be an asset to the town as well. From the beginning of our dream we always stood by the saying of having what we call a “community-based brewery’. To us a community-based brewery is one that will support local business and organizations all through the love of craft beer. We are dedicated to having a positive impact on the community and staying true to our motto of being “Independent, Handcrafted and Local”.
 
What We Need & What You Get
Opening Rehoboth’s first brewery and taproom has proven to be no small task, but with your help we can finally make our dreams a reality! Our $17,500+ goal is what we'll need to finish interior construction on our taproom and purchase brewing equipment so we can offer the highest quality beer possible this Fall/Winter 2020. 
We greatly appreciate your contributions and will be offering a bunch of great rewards as token of our appreciation. The perks we will be offering are as follows:
- Pint Glasses- ABC/""Keever"" Artwork & Sticker Pack- T-Shirts- Sweatshirts- Merch bundles- Barn Raisers Club Membership- Mug Club Membership- ""Golden Growler"" Club Membership- Brew and Name a Beer Party- Ultimate Founders Party Bundle
Your Impact
The past 8 years have all been leading up to this moment. We have tirelessly searched and finally have a place that we believe will be perfect for the brewery and taproom of our dreams. Your contribution to our project represents a unique opportunity to be a part of something special and extremely impactful.
We want to thank you all for checking our campaign out. If you can't contribute, please consider sharing this with your friends, or family to help us spread the word!
We can never thank you all enough for the never-ending support, and we are working tirelessly to get this place built to serve some amazing beer as soon as possible! Please don't hesitate to contact us with any questions you may have.
Cheers,

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Mama Donna's Bakery and <a href=""https://honeyandrosebakery.squarespace.com/about/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Honey &amp; Rose Bakery</a> are launching a joint venture as two independent bakeries located in West Chester, PA. Mama Donna’s Bakery creates exceptional breakfast pastries and baked goods for luxury apartment complexes, hotels, and restaurants. Honey &amp; Rose Bakery creates extraordinary custom cakes, cupcakes, and homemade granola for local retail as well as wholesale markets. Together, we intend to reintroduce consumers to small-batch, locally sourced, high quality, all natural and sustainable ingredient products - farm to oven, oven to fork. </p>
<ul>
<li>Non-GMO flours</li>
<li>Organic, cage-free eggs</li>
<li>Non-GMO butters and creams</li>
<li>Raw sugars and honey</li>
<li>Natural flavors and colors</li>
<li>No preservatives</li>
</ul>
<p>To accomplish this goal, we are targeting the luxury markets, as these are the clients that are best positioned to appreciate the quality,sustainability, and skills that we can offer. <br/><br/>These markets allow us to use the professional skills developed in our previous careers and become not just vendors, but true client partners who work hard to help our clients enhance their luxury brands.</p>
<p>As an example, Mama Donna's Bakery currently partners with a 275-unit luxury apartment complex for the 55+ demographic. As the exclusive provider of their daily continental breakfast, we work with the property manager and staff to ensure all products are tailored to meet the residents' needs at a level of quality that enhances the luxury brand.</p>
<p>As we continue to scale up and establish our brand within these markets, we can expand our impact on the local economies by hiring staff and sourcing local ingredients. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Our most immediate and very pressing need is to move into a space that serves as a production space for our products, with enough room to include a tasting/demo room for clients. We have located a suitable space; however, with our current lease at the Artisan Exchange expiring at the end of January, we have to be prepared to move very quickly.</p>
<p><u><strong>Immediate Needs - 10 Day Flash Funding:</strong></u></p>
<ul>
<li>$3,500 for first/last month's rent + security deposit</li>
<li>$1,200 for licensing and inspections</li>
<li>$2,500 for insurance</li>
<li>$8,000 for equipment (larger oven, plumbing, electric)</li>
<li>$800 for professional movers</li>
</ul>
<p>This flash funding will move us out of our current space and into the new space as quickly as possible without having to interrupt production.</p>
<p>Once settled, we can begin to address longer-term goals for a more extensive build-out that will support our expansion.</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Check out our perks! Cookies, handmade bagels, breakfast treats, and even a cake decorating demo are just some of the great Thank You gifts we can offer in return for your donation. The first 10 funders will find some extra special goodies in their shipment.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Mama Donna's and Honey &amp; Rose bakeries both began operations about three years ago as part of a local community kitchen called the Artisan Exchange. The Exchange serves as a small business incubator for food producers where entrepreneurs can have access to fully licensed commercial kitchen space to test, refine, and sell their products. For two start-up bakeries, it's been an invaluable resource, but we are both quickly outgrowing the space and need to make the jump to reach a wider base of customers. We are ready to fly!</p>
<p>We need your help to make this happen! Given the limitations we face by working out of a community kitchen, we are not able to raise all of the necessary capital to make the leap to the next level. We have a small window for making the transition from the community kitchen space and into our own space where we can be fully prepared for future growth. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our biggest challenge right now is timing. In a perfect world, we will be able to transition smoothly out of the leased spaces we currently occupy and into our own space without needing to interrupt production or deliveries to our customers. This is why this campaign must be done now...with money in hand, we can lock in the new location and begin the work of making our move. The good news is that the space we identified needs a minimal amount of work to be functional. </p>
<p>In the meantime, we're preparing Plans B, C, and D....just in case!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We appreciate and respect that not everyone can donate! You are still a loved and welcome member of our community and campaign! </p>
<p>- Social media is a key factor in building a successful business and best of all, it's free! Share our story and campaign on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, or any other social media platform you choose. Let the word out and help people find us!</p>
<p>- If you're in our area (Chester County, PA), visit Honey &amp; Rose Bakery at one of the farmers' markets where her products are currently sold. Buy yourself a treat! Take a selfie with us! Tell your family and friends about your awesome discovery!</p>
<p>- Send us a review. Have you tried any of our delicious items? If you loved it, let us know! We will post your testimonial to our website and social media pages. Let your voice be heard!</p>
<p>- Refer us to your favorite coffeeshop, hotel, restaurant...let them know that premier baked goods are only a phone call away! </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
Brandy was brutally murdered for absolutely no reason, and I am here to help her family and friends, including myself, be able to sleep at night by highlighting the good that Brandy carried throughout life.</div>
<div>With any money raised, we will start a scholarship fund in Brandy's name for high school students interested in persuing a degree in fine or performing arts.</div>
<div>I established a memorial account at Huntington Bank to assist me in this fund raising. It is called the Brandy Rosine Memorial Fund, <br/>acct: 01780228415.</div>
<div> </div>

</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The following is the eulogy I gave at her funeral:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>""Ladies and gentlemen, family and friends, I would like to thank you for coming today. My name is Krysti. My family lived behind Brandy from the time she was in sixth grade through the time she moved in with her grandparents in highschool.
<p>When I met Brandy, she possessed a teenage angst the size of a football stadium. And I loved that about her. Brandy never settled for anything less than she wanted. Brandy loved deeply and entirely. She was passionate, and had the ability to express her passion through words and actions. She once wrote, “We humans live for compassion. It is written in Darwin. In every known clinical research done, humans strive for that one hug from their mother or that one comforting word from a friend.”</p>
<p>Brandy shared that when she was a toddler, she would get time-outs for yelling at her mother from the backseat of the car to drive faster. This may have led to her receiving a go-kart as a child. She loved going to her cousins to go four-wheeling. ”I learned that it’s fun to ride in the rain,” she said, “That donuts aren’t good for the yard, and thorns are hard to remove. Not from my skin, but from my helmet.” She just wanted to go fast.</p>
<p>Her friends remember taking adventures with her. Diet Mountain Dew, Diet Vault, like Brandy needed energy drinks. They remember lying on the pavement staring at the stars with her. Holding her hand, taking walks, going to concerts. She fell in love with music, as she was a poet as well. She proudly claimed herself an orch-dork in highschool.  Brandy would play Mario Kart and DJ Hero all day if she could.  Brandy was as clever as a fox, and perhaps the most witty person I’ve known. She said once, “If it wasn’t for having to see other people naked, I’d live in a nudest colony.”</p>
<p>I was recently asked what Brandy does for a living. Well… Brandy is a comedian. She’ll pick you up with words. She’s a librarian, an encyclopedia of knowledge. Brandy is a therapist, a shoulder for all of her friends. She lived for helping others, for making other people feel comfortable, for love. Brandy is a musician. She is a spectrum of colors, a renaissance woman, if you will.</p>
<p>All Brandy wanted was to be herself in a world without prejudice, and I believe Brandy achieved that goal. Brandy was an inspiration to others to not fear who you are, but to embrace yourself.</p>
<p>And nothing of this has changed. Brandy is still all of these things. She’s just counting on us to activate our memories and keep her alive.  She shared 20 years with us, and now it is time to cherish those years.</p>
<p>Thank each and every one of you for coming today. Brandy would poop her pants to see the amount of support and love that keeps pouring her direction. Thank you.""</p>

<p>CANFIELD - Friends may call Saturday afternoon from 1 to 3:45 p.m., followed by a memorial service held at 4 p.m. at the Higgins-Reardon Funeral Home, Boardman-Canfield Chapel for Brandy M. Stevens-Rosine, 20, who died May 17, in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Brandy was born in Youngstown on Nov. 30, 1991.</p>
<p>She was a 2010 graduate of Boardman High School, she then enrolled in Youngstown State University to study sociology. While a student at Boardman, Brandy was a member of the orchestra, served on the staff of the “Bugle,” the high school paper and was a member of the Italian and Key clubs. Brandy loved music, writing and enjoyed reading. She regularly attended literary meetings at the Boardman Library.</p>
<p>She will always be remembered as a kind hearted, easy going person with many friends.</p>
<p>She is survived by her mother, Carrie Rosine and her companion, Kevin Gold of Hubbard; grandparents, Richard and Kathy Stevens of Poland and Cindee and Jerry Rosine of Boardman; a sister, Stephanie Rosine; three stepsisters, Lexi, Haley and Kylie Gold; an aunt, Brenda (AJ) Barrett; and nephews, Ethen and Dylan.</p>
<p>She was preceded in death by her father, Michael Rosine and great-grandmothers, Joann Chirns and Ada Harris.</p>
<p>The family has requested that material tributes take the form of donations to a memorial fund in her memory at Huntington Bank.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Brandy's mother has set a goal of 1,500 dollars for the scholarship.</p>

<h3>El Cook</h3>
<p>I was born and raised in Los Angeles and have always been passionate about cooking food. Mexican food in particular has influenced me, from spicy to sweet dishes - it continues to inspire me to create and expand my knowledge in this beautiful cuisine. Living in Finland for the past 9 years, I began to miss the food I loved and with limited ingredients here, I had to start from scratch to create the dishes I was longing for. Now I have an extensive menu that takes me back to my hometown! This is what I want to deliver to my new home, Helsinki.</p>
<p>Mexican food has been getting more and more popular since I moved here in 2009. This has inspired me to gain experience in a professional kitchen, research and establish my own business starting with a small taco stand - exactly the way Mexicans did it when they migrated North &amp; started a food revotution that is now known all over the world. </p>
<p>For many years I've wanted to open my own business to share my passion and love for food with as many people as possible. My hope is that one day, this will be a place for friends and families to meet &amp; enjoy good food and drinks. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>La Tricycle</h3>
<p>The goal for this crowd fundraiser is to help me get the equipment I need to get started. Also, to help spread the word and gain some momentum in my early days. Donations will be greatly appreciated and I plan to give back to my backers by providing a snack, meal or even cater an event. </p>
<p>This will be a one man operation and I will be selling my food via an eco-friendly mobile food stand - a Tricyle :) While this method has its challenges, it gives me the freedom and flexibility to be able to start and potentially grow this business as fast as I can. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Los Backers</h3>
<p>All contributions help, including helping me spread the word to get this out to as many people as possible. I appreciate any help you can send my way!</p>

<p>Dr. Travis Honeycutt has identified and isolated the protein in 
peanut butter that causes the dangerous peanut allergy. That protein can
 be rendered harmless by mixing into peanut butter an ingredient that 
changes the allergy protein molecule. </p>
<p>If every peanut butter 
manufacturer added just a trace amount of this ingredient to their final

Dr. Travis Honeycutt has identified and isolated the protein in 
peanut butter that causes the dangerous peanut allergy. That protein can
 be rendered harmless by mixing into peanut butter an ingredient that 
changes the allergy protein molecule. 
If every peanut butter 
manufacturer added just a trace amount of this ingredient to their final
 product, then all peanut butter would be allergy free. 
This Project will fund the final testing and FDA approval so that
 an allergy free peanut butter will become available at your local 
grocery.
