<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hi!  My name is Indah Boyle and I like to dance.  I currently live in Norwalk, CT but grew up attending American Schools in foreign countries.  In high school I went to Taipei American School (TAS) in Taiwan where my love for dance was nourished and I was encouraged to believe in myself and my dreams.  Upon graduating from TAS, I attended the Conservatory of Dance at SUNY Purchase College in New York and received a B.F.A. in Dance in 2008.  I have performed my choreography at numerous venues in New York City and have taught Ballet and Modern dance in Connecticut and New York.  This past year, I was invited back to my high school in Taipei, Taiwan as a long-term dance substitute where I had the honor of teaching dance courses that I had taken as a student.  I also worked after school teaching my choreography to two groups of dancers selected by audition.  The dancers learned choreography that premiered in New York City and they performed the work at TAS after two months of intense rehearsals.</p>
<p>In February 2011, I chose six dancers from TAS, ages 14-16, to apply and perform my choreography for Backhausdance Platform Performance in Irvine, CA.  Platform is a weekend performance and workshop geared toward pre-professional dancers and emerging choreographers.  Selected participants will perform in three shows at Irvine Valley College and partake in two days of dance workshops.   My piece has been selected to be performed at the Platform performance June 3, 4, and 5.  The students I have asked to perform all live in Taiwan and will be traveling to CA to meet me for the event.  They will perform my piece and participate in workshops all weekend.  All participants are responsible for their own funding. Please visit <a href=""http://www.backhausdance.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.backhausdance.org</a> for more info on Platform and Backhausdance.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Participating in Platform will be a unique opportunity for these students to have exposure to the dance world outside of Taiwan.  The workshops and performances will broaden their experience as dancers and as people.  With mixed nationalities coming from Taiwan, Canada, Venezuela, Japan, and the US, their backgrounds offer diversity to the event.  The students will be funding their own transportation, housing, and meals for the duration of the event.  These students will travel together and meet me in CA.  I will be supervising, transporting, feeding, and rehearsing to prepare them for the performances.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What I am asking from you is to help me pay for my own plane ticket, a rental car, and hotel rooms.  The parents of these students have been unbelievably supportive by funding their own child's plane ticket.  The hard work of creating a dance, performing it several times, re-setting it on high schoolers, and applying for this event is all done and paid for.  All I need now is funding to help me cover the expenses of the trip.  Your contribution of any amount will help make many people very happy.  You will be doing a huge service.  The world needs more dancing.  Any money made beyond the $1500 goal will be used for rehearsal expenses in CA and rehearsals for my upcoming projects.  Check updates and gallery for rehearsal footage of my new work.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>If you're reading this, Hi Uncle Phil!  Remember me?  That kid at the your daughter's wedding who was reading <span style=""font-style: italic;"">The Good Woman of Szechuan</span> (it's pronounced <span style=""font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;"">Brecked</span>) and kept on talking about how <span style=""font-style: italic;"">The Book of Mormon</span> was changing the face of the Broadway Musical?  Remember?  You mentioned how tall I was and I mentioned this theatre company I was involved in?  Then you asked me where the bathroom was and I told you I started it with <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">alumni from the College of William and Mary</span> (GO TRIBE!) in order to make use of our theatre degrees for something else besides waiting tables and singing showtunes on the subway.  You said something about a father-daughter dance starting, but then I had to tell you about our very <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">first production of one-acts in May</span> of this year, that was super well-attended (just like this wedding).  You seemed to leave in a hurry, but I KNOW you wanted to hear more.  So here's why you should return that toaster (it was regifted anyway), and use that money to support <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">BLOWOUT THEATRE COMPANY!</span> <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>This Is How We Dooo It (this is how we do it)<br/>
</h3>Half a dozen plays, twenty actors, two successful nights of theatre.  But that's in the past.  Now we are topping ourselves with a night of world premiere one-acts in October and a production of Peter Sinn Nachtrieb's <span style=""font-style: italic;"">boom </span>in December, our first full length ever (EVER!).  We're working with a super-talented cast and crew on both productions and want to give them everything they need for an amazing show.<br/><br/>
</div><div>
<h3>Why You Should Return that Toaster and Send Money to Us<br/>
</h3>
<p>To bring you the most awesome of awesome productions we need: a space, props, sets, costumes, lights, rights, scripts, programs, flyers, spike tape, musical instruments and probably some small thing we'll discover along the way.  With these tools, we'll be able to give our pool of playwrights, directors, designers, actors, and artists the support to bring their creations to life.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>It's Not All About the Benjamins<br/>
</h3>
<p>Come see us!  Our night of one-acts, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Play Date</span>, is scheduled for October 20, 21, and 22 at 7:30 pm.  We will be at the Producer's Club, located at 358 West 44th Street (that's in New York City, Uncle Phil - you can put it in your GPS).  We'll also have a fundraiser for <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Play Date</span> at the Village Pourhouse (the 46th St location) on October 14 at 7pm, so we can set our season off right.<br/></p>

<h3>About Us</h3>

Another Production Company is dedicated to presenting live performances that incorporate traditional storytelling, audience participation and ensemble based works. Which is why we have selected the Off-Broadway hit musical, The Last Five Years to start our journey. 
Jason Robert Brown's The Last Five Years musical explores the highs and lows of a five year relationship between Jamie Wellerstein, a rising novelist and Catherine Hiatt, a struggling actress. Cathy’s story is told in reverse chronological order, from the end of the relationship to the first kiss and Jamie’s story is told in chronological order. 
The Last Five Years debut in 2001 at North Shore Center for the Performing Arts in Skokie, IL before heading to New York, where it had a successful run.  
We're presenting the revival of this maginificent piece at Stage 773's initimate 69 seat Cabaret Space.

I'm getting my Bachelors in Fine Arts in Dance in May 2013, which is soon. Then I'll be looking for my place in the dance world. In order to have better chances of accomplishing my goal of landing a job with a well-established Dance company (like Mark Morris or Paul Taylor) I need to get noticed with Directors and Choreographers. <br/>American Dance Festival offers a great opportunity for dancers to see many different Choreographers. A.D.F. offers nine days of classes, panels, performances, and more. They have a well known group of outstanding teachers who demonstrate supportive learning environments with individual attention. I'll get to learn about the ""New York"" dance scene from artists who are currently creating work. Plus ill get to see open rehearsals and performances at Alvin Alley or The Joyce Theater for an ""insiders"" perspective. And all while living the New York DREAM and having fun!<br/><br/>I'll need expensives for the intensive to start. For me to sign up and reserve a spot I must make a deposit of $200. After Deposit secured my spot, I have to pay the remaining total of $550 by November 30th 2012. A total of $750 for the winter intensive. I'll also need travel (plane, and taxi) expenses to help me get there and stay there living (hotel) a nutritional dancers life. I'll be dancing Eight hours a day so it is very important for me to keep up on my nutrition during strenuous daily activity. Though, all your money WILL be refunded if I miss the deadline to registration.</h3>
<h3>If you would rather send me a check in the mail, I would deposit the money and use that as a donation from myself to my campaign so you can see the money will be there for good!

In order to have better chances of accomplishing my goal of landing a job with a well-established Dance company (like Mark Morris or Paul Taylor) I need to get noticed with Directors and Choreographers. American Dance Festival offers a great opportunity for dancers to see many different Choreographers. A.D.F. offers nine days of classes, panels, performances, and more. They have a well known group of outstanding teachers who demonstrate supportive learning environments with individual attention. I'll get to learn about the ""New York"" dance scene from artists who are currently creating work. Plus ill get to see open rehearsals and performances at Alvin Alley or The Joyce Theater for an ""insiders"" perspective. And all while living the New York DREAM and having fun!I'll need expensives for the intensive to start. For me to sign up and reserve a spot I must make a deposit of $200. After Deposit secured my spot, I have to pay the remaining total of $550 by November 30th 2012. A total of $750 for the winter intensive. I'll also need travel (plane, and taxi) expenses to help me get there and stay there living (hotel) a nutritional dancers life. I'll be dancing Eight hours a day so it is very important for me to keep up on my nutrition during strenuous daily activity. Though, all your money WILL be refunded if I miss the deadline to registration.
If you would rather send me a check in the mail, I would deposit the money and use that as a donation from myself to my campaign so you can see the money will be there for good! I will put your name in the description.I will be setting up a blog for donators to look at daily and see my progress with this Winter Intensives and to see how much fun I would be having daily.   Dancers never stop learning, and this would be a great opportunity to achieve further mastery and professionalism for my future in Dance!Thanks,Will C.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Named for the period of time
between graduation and the beginning of student loan repayment, The Grace
Period is a team made up of seven anonymous artists attempting to work through
the difficulties of making a living as an artist in a weakened economy. In its
current iteration, The Grace Period Blog, each of the seven artists has taken
their own personal and artistic journey through the ups and downs of leading an
artistic life in today’s world. Now, the members of The Grace Period are
collaborating on a live performance which will combine our voices with yours,
and with the voices of millions of other citizens facing serious student loan
debt. To make this project come to life, and in the spirit of community and
solidarity, we need your help!</p>
<p><b>WHAT WE NEED</b></p>
<p>We can’t do this without your support! If you’re unable to
donate, we ask you to please share this link and help to get our voices and our
cause out there; we also invite you to check out our blog if you haven't yet and of course, to save the date for our performance, <b><u>which of course will be FREE!</u></b></p>
<p>We’re making our art work for us. But we can’t do it alone.
Here’s a breakdown of our anticipated expenses for the project/performance:</p>
<p><b>WAGES</b></p>
<p>This is part of
making our art work for us. If you feel that all (art)work is of value and
should be compensated, as we do, this is where you can help make this happen! We
have all put in many hours for this project, not just in planning and preparing
this performance, but in researching, writing blog posts, and, eventually, in
rehearsal time. It’s all been a lot of hard work, and we’re thankful for it! In
keeping with our theme of art, work, and the value of art/artists in today’s
society, part of our project entails earning minimum wage for the work we have
done. Though it is difficult to calculate just how many hours we have worked on
our own projects, we have narrowed our wages to the collaborative meetings (and
rehearsals yet to  come) held by the
members of The Grace Period. </p>
<p>Minimum wage sits at $7.25/hour and we
are each committing to 35 hours of work from each member. 7.25 x 7 members x 35
hours = $1776.25</p>
<p>Since the time put into blog posts is
less simple to calculate, we have taken a route similar to many freelancing
websites or journal publications, who pay either per piece or per word. For
each blog post we are asking $5.00 in payment, from September 2 to November 21
only. Each member will have posted a total of 8 blog entries. 8 posts x 7
members x 5.00 per piece = $280.00.</p>
<p>Total amount of wages: $2,056.25</p>
<p><b>PERFORMANCE MATERIALS</b></p>
<p>For now, we’re keeping many of the
details of our performance under wraps in order to preserve an atmosphere of
spontaneity and in-the-heat-of-the-moment political passion. What we can reveal
is some of our materials and their cost:</p>
<p>Equipment/supplies for the performance:</p>
<p>Megaphones: $301.00 </p>
<p>Cups: $36.00 </p>
<p>Jello: $60.00 </p>
<p>Zip Car/Uhaul rental: $80.00</p>
<p>Total amount of performance
supplies/equipment: $477.00</p>
<p><b>PROMOTIONAL MATERIALS, INCLUDING PERKS FOR YOU OUR SUPPORTERS:</b></p>
<p>Printing/Mailing Budget: $500.00</p>
<p>Biz Cards: $60.00</p>
<p>Save-the-Date Postcards: $130.00</p>
<p>Postcards for sponsors (you!): $200.00</p>
<p>Total amount of promotional materials:
$890.00</p>
<p>Total amount of performance &amp;
promotional materials: $1367.00</p>
<p><b>INDIEGOGO FEES </b>(Not added to our goal)</p>
<p>If the project’s goal is reached,
Indiegogo charges 4% of the total amount earned. This is equal to $115.58 of
our total cost.</p>
<p>In addition, credit card processing
fees make up a total of 3% of our earned funds. This is equal to $86.68 of our
total cost.</p>
<p>Total amount of fees: $346.73</p>
<p>Total project cost: $3423.25 (before indiegogo
fees). </p>
<p>So we are just asking for $ 3,500.00,
to have a round number and cover some of the fees.</p>
<p><b>WHAT YOU GET</b></p>
<p>In addition to the warm, fuzzy feeling of helping us fulfill
our financial and artistic goals, we’ve arranged some perks that you’ll receive
for certain donation amounts. Here’s what you can get from us as a thank you gesture:</p>
<p>$1.00 We’ll give you or your organization a
public thank you on our Facebook page and/or Twitter account</p>
<p>$5.00 In keeping with our price of $5 per
blog, for a $5 donation we will invite you to be a guest blogger with us and

<p></p><p>Flamenco has shaped my life’s history. It is
my great passion. It excites my mind, it enraptures my soul and comforts my
spirit. Through flamenco I find truth, beauty and goodness. Good flamenco is
always stirring to the listener who hears with their heart. It communicates
beyond what words can describe and beyond what movement can say. It is the
language of the soul. Flamenco is more than a profession to me, it is a way of
life, and it permeates my personal and professional life through its philosophy
of honesty, dignity and integrity. </p><p>Flamenco, an art form like no other, speaks to the
heart and touches the soul. The award winning Esmeralda Spanish Dance Company of
Canadian and Spanish dancers, singers and musicians deliver the power of this
expressive art with elegance and passion. The company never fails to enthrall
audiences, eliciting shouts of <i>olé</i>

You get to stay in Italy for a month, learn how to stage manage opera, and you get an equity credit too. I have been trying for years to get an equity credit and I saw the notice in my email about the CO-SI program. Since at the time it was a bit of an impulse, I signed up not thinking I would get in with my lack of music knowledge.Then a couple of days ago I get a notice saying I was accepted. I had to read the letter a few times to see if I read ""you've been accepted"" correctly , or it was actually said ""you've been ACCEPTED to not join our program..."" But no, it said I was accepted. Yeay! When I finally came out of my happy trance, I found I had to get half of the money in by March 30th, then the other half by April 30th.So I thought that was a bit stressful in such a short time, but that wasn't the end of it I found out today that the amount I need to get is just for the tuition. I also have to raise money for airfare, travel insurance, and make a deposit to my flight by MARCH 13TH. So I am freaking out a little because I have about $50 in the bank and it's not looking good for me.The sad truth is with my 4-5 jobs at minimum wage there is no way to get at least half of the amount by the end of the month and this is one of those situations where I can't do this on my own._____________________________________________________________Back to Present DaySome of my friends suggested trying Indiegogo and see what comes out of it. I know it helped my boyfriend (Zach Counsil) for his audition in New York, so hopefully it helps me ,the little match stick girl, with my predicament.I don't expect to raise the whole $7000 with Indiegogo, but ANY amount I make with this campaign would be a step in the right direction for sure. You can donate ANY amount you like, 1$, 5$.... $7000 I will  be tremendously happy with your generosity. I know the theatre community is always happy to lend a hand to support there fellow artists and I am confident that I will kick butt in this program. Then when I have finished my program with flying colours, thanks to everyone who donated, Ottawa Ontario (and the world) will have another bad ass mo-fo stage manager on their team. So it is pretty much a win win situation.Thank you so much for coming to my indiegogo website. If you like more info on the CO-SI program, click here. If you are poor like me, can't afford to donate, but want to help, please spread the word to anyone and everyone you know so I can get a chance to make my wish come true by becoming a stage managing pro.Wish me Luck!To entice you even further, here is a cat video to get some extra sympathy votes. :DLove Ya!What I need to Raise._________________________By March 29th I will need to raise $2175 for half of the tuition fees.By April 30th I will need another $2175 for the other half of the tution fees.
$1400 for the rest of the Airfare, travel and medical insurance, Ingiegogo takes a chunck which would be roughly around $500 if I reach my goal.

<p align=""left"">The Women’s Bellydance Center (WBC) has been in Tallahassee, FL since 2006, but this year we’re dreaming big. Julie Wilson, the center’s director, built it from the ground up. She has danced her way through breast cancer, fibromyalgia, and being a single mom. She’s served as an inspiration for me and many of the other women and girls that have studied under her. I’m Patrice DeVore, and this year, along with the entire troupe, we are mobilizing to boost the name recognition of the Women’s Bellydance Center and get enough money to revitalize the tradition of an annual show.</p>
<p align=""left"">This is phase one of our journey, we want to boost our name recognition by getting a booth at the “What Women Want” expo. This is an event in Tallahassee held every year by the local Cumulus radio stations. It’s the perfect opportunity for us, the attendance at this event increases every year and this year we’re not going to miss out. Your contributions will help us pay for the booth, radio spots with Cumulus, and promotional items to give away at the booth.</p>
<p align=""left""><strong>So Here’s the Deal</strong></p>
<p align=""left"">We are asking for $700, the basics of what we need to make this happen. We need $250 (we have already scraped together the deposit of $250) for the What Women Want booth itself, $300 to spend on local radio ads, and $200 to spend on promotional items to give away at our booth.</p>
<p align=""left"">In return, you, the generous donor, gets to choose from a number of amazing perks. You can get perks ranging from beautiful hip scarves, to free classes for a month at the center! This definitely worth getting in on!</p>
<p align=""left"">The real deal is that no matter what you give, we’ll think you’re awesome. Even if you can’t monetarily, but you still let people know about us and like our facebook page, we’ll still think you’re awesome. Trust me, we know about being broke. Check out our website or tell your friend who’s looking for something different to try. Then sit back and appreciate the warm fuzzies flowing in your direction.</p>
<p align=""left""><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p align=""left"">We’re the girls who like glitter and sparkles, but still want to seem cultured and sophisticated. We like swinging swords and playing with fire. We’re a complicated bunch, but we think we’re cool. The impact of this campaign is enabling us to show how cool we are. That’s the overall goal. We also kind of want to keep a roof over our studio too, but why don’t we just lump that in with the cool part and call it good?</p>
<p align=""left"">This phase of our mission will hopefully get the people in the door to take classes, and get our name out to be hired for gigs. That’s the point, short and sweet. </p></div>","Who We are and What We’re Up To

<h3>What is WANDERLUST?<br/>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>WANDERLUST is a strip show and circus with an all-queer cast from across the nation. It is performance art for queers, by queers.<br/></p>
<p>What if the prospect of the TSA patdown was
 not anxiety-producing and terrifying for trans* travelers, but rather 
tantalizing?? What if rest stop bathrooms weren’t full of suspicious 
everyday-gender-police, but doily-flagging queers into hot, consensual 
(and of course, safer) public sex? How might bicycling queers combat and
 preempt road rage using their U-lock in a fantasy scenario?

</p>
<p>WANDERLUST aims to answer these questions and more, while entertaining the <br/>audience
 and turning them on. With a cast of professional aerialists, pole 
dancers, striptease artists and dancers this live theater show (with 
video interludes by esteemed filmmakers) is guaranteed to be a hit. It 
is currently in pre-production, and slated to debut in June 2014 in the 
San Francisco Bay Area. With a dual cast (East and West Coasts of North 
America) WANDERLUST will bring this sensuous show to a wide audience.</p>
<p></p>
<br/><h3>Why Is This Show Important??<br/>
</h3>
<p><br/>For
 trans* and gender non-conforming people, and queer people of MANY 
intersectionalities, transit spaces (airports, buses, subways, streets, 
sidewalks) are often some of the most anxiety-ridden and problematic: 
full of overly-watchful eyes, invasive questions and procedures, and 
constant policing. Money hungry airlines shame and harm fat-bodied and 
disabled-bodied people to no end. Queers are targeted and harassed on 
the streets, at X-ray machines, while crossing borders, and more.</p>
<p>This group strip show and circus arts 
performance is a trans*/queer re-imagining of various travel spaces as 
at once size/ability/gender-affirming AND sexy. At its root, this 
project tells the stories of those of us who move through the world in 
bodies that refuse to meet other people’s expectations.</p>
<p></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>$9700. We're committed to paying our artists in a way that recognizes that a performance is just the tip of the iceberg - beneath the surface is intellectual labor, development, travel, workshop, rehearsal and more.<br/>
</li>
<li>Our perks are ridiculous! They're useful AND cool. Our multi-talented artists are putting their skills to work to offer you some of the most original perks around. Custom leather luggage tags, a chance to win tickets and art, a cocktail hour with cast members, and a professional massage are just some of the great perks that come with donating!<br/>

<h2><strong>LONE WOLF TRIBE is...</strong></h2>
<p>A multi-disciplinary theatre company sparked long ago from the simple act of my grandmother making a sock puppet for me as a boy. That gift, that notion of creating and sharing from the heart, has led my artistic path ever since.  I've put my heart and soul into Lone Wolf Tribe. Utilizing all my gifts and talents, LWT's mission is to create original theatre and share stories with a live audience, focusing on what brings us together rather than what keeps us apart.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2><strong>WE ARE RAISING MONEY TO...</strong></h2>
<p>Help fund our first official ""season""~ where we'll produce and perform 2 NY debut productions within 4 months of each other! </p>
<p>The Season:</p>
<h2><em><strong>The God Projekt</strong></em></h2>
<p>November 14th - 24th, 2013 at La MaMa, Etc.</p>
<p><em>A minimal extravaganza, heaven-set murder mystery! </em> God, alone in a Beckett-inspired vision of paradise, does his level best to manage his divine office. But while fielding an unending flow of prayer requests, he uncovers a secret from his ancient past he'd rather remain forgotten. A daring and compassionate journey about waking up to one's own truth.</p>
<h2><em><strong>Hobo Grunt Cycle</strong></em></h2>
<p>March 14th - 29th, 2014 at Dixon Place  </p>
<p>Challenging war's futility with poetic imagery and a clown's mix of humor and pathos, this nearly silent circus pantomime looks towards a path to peace. Forging empathetic links between wounded soldiers and rescued fight dogs, the post-war legacy of veterans is exposed when a lowly tramp puts his heart and soul into healing his beloved pet. </p>
<p> <em>Associate collaborators: Brooklyn for Peace, Veterans for Peace, Fort Green for Peace</em></p>
<h2><strong>THE REASON WE NEED YOUR HELP...</strong></h2>
<p>Lone Wolf Tribe's shows are expensive ~ more than your typical puppet show. The main reason for this is that they take a long time to create. Generally, from initial ideas to fully produced show, one production takes us between 2 to 3 years! </p>
<p>A big part of that time is spent pushing the limits of our capabilities through development and experimentation. Fueled by a drive for artistic excellence, we never lose sight that all the work and long hours are towards a greater good: to share something wonderful and unforgettable with our audience.</p>
<h2><strong>LONE WOLF TRIBE'S IMPACT...</strong></h2>
<p>Our hope is that we raise the bar of the theatrical experience for both national and international audiences.  As we join the magic and beauty of puppetry with an empathetic consciousness of the world around us - through intelligent stories that aim to touch both the heart and mind - our creative desire is to play a small part in making this world a more wonderful place.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2><strong>DOLLARS AND CENTS...</strong></h2>
<p>The specific funds we will raise will go to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Artistic Fees: Puppeteers, designers (sound, lighting, costume, graphics), collaborators, technicians                                                                       </li>
<li>Rehearsal space</li>
<li>Equipment, materials &amp; special effects</li>
<li>Marketing, promotion and postage</li>
<li>Curation and installation of an exhibition of original veteran art work to be shown in the Dixon Place gallery during the run of Hobo Grunt Cycle </li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi I am Lenny Schwartz! I am trying to raise funds to bring eleven actors from Rhode Island to NYC...one way or another we are going but I figured I would try this way and try to do a little good in the process.</p>
<p>We here at Daydream Theatre Company are trying to raise <a class=""FAtxtL"" href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-someone-for-everyone-campaign/x/502621"" id=""FALINK_3_0_2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">money</a> for a play we are doing in NYC called ""Subject 62."" We are performing at the Gene Frankel Theatre.</p>
<p>Subject 62 is a play written and directed by Lenny Schwartz. It is a surreal drama about an artist, Chris, who is afflicted with a degenrative disease called Huntington's. When he is signed up for a unique experiment to find a cure, he finds himself trapped in his memories, losing them as he tries to hold onto a single one to take with him.</p>
<p>Basicaly we are taking 11 actors from RI to NYC...and that costs money. We are already on the fundraising trail but here's the thing: The money will go to housing and feeding the actors. That being said, it won't cost 3600 to do that. So we will donate whatever extra we don;t need to the charitable orginization Huntington's Disease Association of America which is the national network for people afflicted with this terrible disease. . So spread the word...and I will donate whatever we do not use.</p>
<p>IF WE RAISE THE FULL 3600 on here? I will PERSONALLY DONATE 250 to the  Huntington's Disease Association of America and if we don't I'll still donate 50 dollars!-Lenny</p>

We here at Daydream Theatre Company are trying to raise money for a play we are doing in NYC called ""Subject 62."" We are performing at the Gene Frankel Theatre.
Subject 62 is a play written and directed by Lenny Schwartz. It is a surreal drama about an artist, Chris, who is afflicted with a degenrative disease called Huntington's. When he is signed up for a unique experiment to find a cure, he finds himself trapped in his memories, losing them as he tries to hold onto a single one to take with him.
Basicaly we are taking 11 actors from RI to NYC...and that costs money. We are already on the fundraising trail but here's the thing: The money will go to housing and feeding the actors. That being said, it won't cost 3600 to do that. So we will donate whatever extra we don;t need to the charitable orginization Huntington's Disease Association of America which is the national network for people afflicted with this terrible disease. . So spread the word...and I will donate whatever we do not use.
IF WE RAISE THE FULL 3600 on here? I will PERSONALLY DONATE 250 to the  Huntington's Disease Association of America and if we don't I'll still donate 50 dollars!-Lenny

<h3>Hello all!</h3>
<p>My name is Shawn Nabors. I'm a recent college graduate of Syracuse University, a Brooklyn, N.Y. native and an actor, playwright and poet. I'm ridiculously ecstatic about having the opportunity to produce my brand new play, <strong>CAKE</strong>, Off-Broadway this summer at the American Theatre of Actors from August 1st - 4th! I'm also very excited to be able to make you a part of this extraordinary creative process.</p>
<p> <strong>CAKE</strong> is going to be produced this summer through a program called the Araca Project. The play will be opening this years 2nd annual season of shows, all shows being produced by young emerging theatre artists. </p>
<p>The play takes place on March 3rd, in Brooklyn, N.Y. on the eve of the main character, Messiah's, late daughters 3rd birthday. Overwhelmed with grief and regret, Messiah is at the lowest low point of his life and has not left his room in days. He goes online and arranges a ""casual encounter"" with a young man named Ari and the two of them wind up invested and involved in way more than either one of them originally expected. </p>
<p>Words cannot express how thrilled I am to have the chance to bring this story to life. I've been working on this play tirelessly for the past year and a half and am ready to step into the next necessary phase of development. I am in need of <strong>$7,000 </strong>of funding for <strong>Light</strong>, <strong>Sound</strong>, <strong>Set &amp; Costume design</strong>, <strong>Transportation of equipment</strong>, <strong>Rehearsal space</strong>, etc. </p>
<p>I have been dreaming about pursuing a career theatre since I was twelve years old and now, after college, I finally have the opportunity to do so. This is an experience that I cannot pass up on. My life as an artist and as a human being will forever be changed by this. I would learn not only how to further my training as an actor but also gain first hand knowledge on how to produce a show with a team of producers. The ability to create one's own opportunities is crucial in this business and I will be able to take the things I learn from this experience with me into future creative endeavors throughout the duration of my career.</p>
<p>This play is very edgy and raw in a lot of its content and its important to me present strong images for the sake of widening perspectives and creating dialogue amongst people. Wouldn't you love to be a part of that? : )</p>
<p>Perks!</p>

<p>The buzz before the curtain rises.  There is nothing like it.  Brava! For Women in the Arts invites you to catch a buzz with us as we work to revitalize a San Francisco treasure. Brava is seeking $50,000 to seed the revitalization of the organization and jumpstart the completion of the Brava Theater Center, a performance, education and community engagement space in San Francisco’s Mission District. </p>
<h3><strong>OUR STORY</strong></h3>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ZL4lX75LVdw/T6LgKiWzJ3I/AAAAAAAAFzo/7L2JAs8LTrA/s512/Brava%25202.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Founded in 1986 by an eclectic, talented group of women artists, Brava evolved from an all-volunteer organization into a nationally recognized producing and presenting organization with a devoted audience and a production history of more than 1,400 performances seen by over 350,000 people.  For over 25 years Brava has been a gathering place for community arts organizations, and nationally and internationally acclaimed artists.  Of equal importance is the role Brava has played in sustaining arts education in neighborhood schools, providing vital programming in theater training to the young people San Francisco. </p>
<h3><strong>THE PROJECT</strong></h3>
<p>In 1996, Brava bought the York Theater – a 10,000 square foot property on 24<sup>th</sup> street between York and Hampshire that included a 70-year-old former vaudeville house and six storefronts - and began a three-stage renovation.  The first two stages converted the 900-seat movie house into an intimate 365-seat theater that included a renovated lobby and a 1,200 square foot studio/second stage multi-purpose space.  The third and final stage of the renovation, which began in 2008, was put on hold as Brava, like many organizations both locally and nationally began to feel the impact of the Great Recession.   This final stage will convert the six abandoned storefronts along 24<sup>th</sup> Street into much needed dressing rooms for the main stage, office space for Brava and other non-profit arts and community organizations and a 1,000 square foot area destined to be a multi-purpose performance/rehearsal space.<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Tty9ZiQBc6g/T6LgKa5AjoI/AAAAAAAAFzk/TH_1k_eFACQ/s512/brava%2520exterior.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></p>
<h3><strong>THE IMPACT</strong></h3>
<p>Brava Theatre Center is an anchor in the grassroots driven economic development of the 24<sup>th</sup> Street Corridor in the Mission District.  The Center provides vital artistic and cultural enrichment for the community, and serves as an important tool in arts education.  We are very happy that on March 15th Loco Bloco moved in as a resident company. They will join long time renters Cuicacalli Escuela de Danza and 915 Cayuga, a radio drama performance group as artists-in-residence at the Brava Theater Center.   Additional bookings and new residents include:  Teatro Vagon, Classical Revolution, La Bohemia Productions, Volti Chitresh Das Dance, Freshmeat Productions, Thrill Peddlers, and The 1<sup>st</sup> Annual Son Jarocho Festival.</p>
<p>It is these community artists, educational and community engagement organizations that will benefit from a complete and self-sustaining building.  In addition, the completed facility will have significant economic impact on the 24<sup>th</sup> Street corridor, as Brava’s audiences, students, and production staff that pass through our doors the more our neighboring restaurants, eateries, cultural institutions, corner stores, bookstores, and shops will benefit from our clientele. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>BRAVA!’s leadership has a strong vision of how to improve our facilities to better serve our mission by completing this renovation.  In preparing to move forward Brava recently has under gone staff restructuring.  The organization’s new Executive Director is Stacie Powers Cuellar.  In a career spanning 30 years in San Francisco’s community arts scene, Stacie has worked with a wide range of organizations as an arts and financial administrator, including the San Francisco Mime Troupe, Frameline’s International LGBT Film Festival, Dance Brigade and Dance Mission Theater.</p>

Thank you so much!</p><p>Lot of love </p><p>Mzz Kim xx</p><i>And the campaign.............................................</i><p><b>Who am I and why do I need you?</b></p><p>My name is Mzz Kimberly (call me Mzz Kim!). I’m a transgender singer and performer from the US, now living in the UK. I have a
wide repertoire of music and have performed in over 50 London venues including
residencies at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern, The Ivy and recent performances with
one of my fans – Stephen K Amos and on Britain's Got Talent. My voice has been compared many times
to Bassey and Tina Turner and in 2011 I won the BOYZ award for best cabaret
artist.</p>Transgender rights have come a long way in the last 20 years but there is still a high level of invisibility for us in the arts. I want to contribute to trans art by taking a new show to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2014 and show the UK what we transfolk can do! <p></p><p>My show will be called <i>'A Tranny on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown!' </i>But I can't do this without your help. If you support me I will be able to list my show on the local Fringe news and complete a full run (which I will be able to put on for free). I don't want to do a token show - I want it to be up there with the more established types of act.</p><p><b>What do I need and what can I give you in return?</b></p><p>I have saved up some money myself but don't have enough to take my show to the Fringe in order to give 26 free shows. I need another £3,000 to do it. This will pay for:</p><p>* My listings at the Fringe so people know I will be there</p><p>* Accommodation for the fortnight (a bedsit will do!)</p><p>* Travel (I'll stand on the baggage rack if I have to....)</p><p>* Administrative expenses - securing the show, etc</p><p>* Show expenses and props - and remember - I wont be charging an entry fee!</p><p>Supporting me is not just about shining a light on transgender art and allowing me to go to Edinburgh! As well as my gratitude and love you will receive one of 5 perks depending on your contribution. VIP access, private dinner at 116 Pall Mall or a special mention on my next video - there is a treat for everyone.</p><p>I have worked the budget out so that if I don't make my target of £3,000 I can do a limited run instead - perhaps not the full package but I won't let any contributions go to waste - I will do what I can within any means possible but the £3,000 is a realistic amount for the Fringe on a shoestring.</p><p><b>Impact</b></p><p>Each year I go to, and usually perform at, London's Trans Day of Remembrance. I do this to raise awareness of the plight of many trans people around the world. Last year the figure of trans murders were around 300 and that's the tip of the iceberg. </p><p>This is important but this campaign is different, I want to show the talents of our community by taking my show to Edinburgh and representing the trans communities across the UK.

We have commitments of another £1,300 so have made our target of £3,000!

Those of you who have picked a perk will receive a separate message with details - if you have selected the VIP fringe ticket then please let me know which date you want to meet me and I will get the Champagne!! Signed posters will be delivered after my final show and don't forget to look out for your behind the scenes video towards the end of the month! Thank you so much!Lot of love Mzz Kim xxAnd the campaign.............................................Who am I and why do I need you?My name is Mzz Kimberly (call me Mzz Kim!). I’m a transgender singer and performer from the US, now living in the UK. I have a
wide repertoire of music and have performed in over 50 London venues including
residencies at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern, The Ivy and recent performances with
one of my fans – Stephen K Amos and on Britain's Got Talent. My voice has been compared many times
to Bassey and Tina Turner and in 2011 I won the BOYZ award for best cabaret
artist.Transgender rights have come a long way in the last 20 years but there is still a high level of invisibility for us in the arts. I want to contribute to trans art by taking a new show to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2014 and show the UK what we transfolk can do! My show will be called 'A Tranny on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown!' But I can't do this without your help. If you support me I will be able to list my show on the local Fringe news and complete a full run (which I will be able to put on for free). I don't want to do a token show - I want it to be up there with the more established types of act.What do I need and what can I give you in return?I have saved up some money myself but don't have enough to take my show to the Fringe in order to give 26 free shows. I need another £3,000 to do it. This will pay for:* My listings at the Fringe so people know I will be there* Accommodation for the fortnight (a bedsit will do!)* Travel (I'll stand on the baggage rack if I have to....)* Administrative expenses - securing the show, etc* Show expenses and props - and remember - I wont be charging an entry fee!Supporting me is not just about shining a light on transgender art and allowing me to go to Edinburgh! As well as my gratitude and love you will receive one of 5 perks depending on your contribution. VIP access, private dinner at 116 Pall Mall or a special mention on my next video - there is a treat for everyone.I have worked the budget out so that if I don't make my target of £3,000 I can do a limited run instead - perhaps not the full package but I won't let any contributions go to waste - I will do what I can within any means possible but the £3,000 is a realistic amount for the Fringe on a shoestring.ImpactEach year I go to, and usually perform at, London's Trans Day of Remembrance. I do this to raise awareness of the plight of many trans people around the world. Last year the figure of trans murders were around 300 and that's the tip of the iceberg. This is important but this campaign is different, I want to show the talents of our community by taking my show to Edinburgh and representing the trans communities across the UK. I will be showing the positive side of trans and hopefully do my bit to raise the profile of trans causes. As a result of the publicity I hope to get I will raise awareness of trans issues in the UK and abroad. Other ways you can helpI hope you will be able to make a contribution but if not I still need your help. Please shout about my campaign and let me know about this crowdfunding project. Please share www.mzzkim.com.Why not put on a benefit for me or do a sponsored run?Or come a long to one of my fundraisers in London over the coming months (Check back here regularly for more details or on my www.facebook.com/mzz.kimberley).But most importantly, I want to thank you for your support - whether in person or spirit - let's go to the Fringe together!Lots of LoveMzz Kimberley",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p></p><p></p><p>Hi. My
name is Marcus Siler and I am the owner/founder of Theatre and Me, LLC. I am a
graduate of East Stroudsburg University with a BA in Theatre
(acting/directing). I am a professional actor and singer. I have been
performing professionally since I was young. Besides being a performer I am a
teacher (preschool/toddler), mentor, and child advocate. I have also taught
high school programs, elderly programs, the Upward Bound Program, served as a
child care director and several other positions that concentrate in helping a
child and teen grow and develop. I have dedicated my life to helping children.
I also have a strong background in creating shows, writing, and developing
programs.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/285216/files/20131231072940-5359_165209633651030_433109840_n.jpg?1388503780"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>My
company's mission is to promote a fun, relaxed, respectful and positive
learning environment that encourages our students to interact with one another
and build self-confidence, self-respect and self-love. Through the art form of
""Theatre"" our students will be given the opportunity to discover
their own inner voice. Some of the creative/performing activities they learn
about are acting, voice, dance, stage, film and design techniques to help them
better understand more about this ever growing art form of ""Theatre"".
This company is led by our guiding principle: ""When you understand more of
whom you are then life with all of its complications will be much
simpler."" </p>
<p>I am
running this campaign because last year, 2013, with a very<b> limited to no budget </b>at all, my volunteers
and I were able to help several students understand more about themselves. <b>We were able, with our students, to write,
direct, and film a short PSA film about
anti-bullying, four commercial shorts, teach students about performing,
drawing, music, directing, production, and several other creative and
performing art elements. </b>We worked out of a shared studio and we had
a great first year.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/285220/files/20131231073303-IMG_4270.JPG?1388503983"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FKv02-82TMCE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DKv02-82TMCE&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FKv02-82TMCE%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a2b78eb2d12f45f9a400a7341cc8e511&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">In 2014,
we have big plans. We would love to have our own studio home where we can
continue to help students express and grow their creativity and self-confidence.
We have two production projects that we will be working on with our students to
create and to film. One of the short films is about coping with a relative that
is ill, and the other one is about loving who you are and being true to yourself. </span><br/><p></p>
<p>If you
contribute and help make this campaign a success we will be able to, produce
better quality products, reach more students, offer more free classes to those
who cannot afford to learn this craft, and to have a space that is more
conducive to a creative/performing arts class. You will  help us own, instead of always renting, the
equipment needed to give our students the opportunity to practice in front of the
camera as well as learn behind the camera techniques. </p>
<p>With your
help in 2014 we will be able to create and film two strong films. You will also
assist us to help students who have a passion for this art form of
""Theatre"", and who do not have the finances to be able to enroll in performing/creative arts programs. Helping children means the world to me and with the right funding
Theatre and Me will be able to do more to benefit their lives. </p>

Hi. My
name is Marcus Siler and I am the owner/founder of Theatre and Me, LLC. I am a
graduate of East Stroudsburg University with a BA in Theatre
(acting/directing). I am a professional actor and singer. I have been
performing professionally since I was young. Besides being a performer I am a
teacher (preschool/toddler), mentor, and child advocate. I have also taught
high school programs, elderly programs, the Upward Bound Program, served as a
child care director and several other positions that concentrate in helping a
child and teen grow and develop. I have dedicated my life to helping children.
I also have a strong background in creating shows, writing, and developing
programs.My
company's mission is to promote a fun, relaxed, respectful and positive
learning environment that encourages our students to interact with one another
and build self-confidence, self-respect and self-love. Through the art form of
""Theatre"" our students will be given the opportunity to discover
their own inner voice. Some of the creative/performing activities they learn
about are acting, voice, dance, stage, film and design techniques to help them
better understand more about this ever growing art form of ""Theatre"".
This company is led by our guiding principle: ""When you understand more of
whom you are then life with all of its complications will be much
simpler."" 
I am
running this campaign because last year, 2013, with a very limited to no budget at all, my volunteers
and I were able to help several students understand more about themselves. We were able, with our students, to write,
direct, and film a short PSA film about
anti-bullying, four commercial shorts, teach students about performing,
drawing, music, directing, production, and several other creative and
performing art elements. We worked out of a shared studio and we had
a great first year.In 2014,
we have big plans. We would love to have our own studio home where we can
continue to help students express and grow their creativity and self-confidence.
We have two production projects that we will be working on with our students to
create and to film. One of the short films is about coping with a relative that
is ill, and the other one is about loving who you are and being true to yourself. 
If you
contribute and help make this campaign a success we will be able to, produce
better quality products, reach more students, offer more free classes to those
who cannot afford to learn this craft, and to have a space that is more
conducive to a creative/performing arts class. You will  help us own, instead of always renting, the
equipment needed to give our students the opportunity to practice in front of the
camera as well as learn behind the camera techniques. 
With your
help in 2014 we will be able to create and film two strong films. You will also
assist us to help students who have a passion for this art form of
""Theatre"", and who do not have the finances to be able to enroll in performing/creative arts programs. Helping children means the world to me and with the right funding
Theatre and Me will be able to do more to benefit their lives. 
Thank you
all, in advance, for your support! 
What We Need
Our
Goal: $63,899.94
This
budget will cover the essentials that we need in order to fully teach our
clientele for the year of 2014, rent a studio space that is spacious enough for our students needs, buy essential supplies needed for our classes, and to be able to do our three student projects (two short films and our end of the year project). This budget will also help us to be able to offer 25 students free classes for the year of 2014. Having
sufficient space and equipment for the students to learn and practice their
craft is most essential. What You Get
Our
perks range from a
shout out on Facebook to a credit in our short film titled ""The
Bully"" to being brought on stage at our (2014) end of the year showcase,
for audience applause, to being placed on our studio wall of sponsors, as well

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>Who are you?</i></p>
<p>The Aeneid Theatre Company is a new student theatre company devoted to independently producing upstanding non-musical plays at USC. Our first adventure is already well underway: We've recently chosen, cast, and established a technical crew for our first-ever production, Six Degrees of Separation by John Guare. </p>
<p><i>What's that? </i></p>
<p>Six Degrees of Separation is a Pulitzer Prize-winning tragicomedy that gracefully maneuvers issues of class conflict, sexual orientation, and race. The play was written twenty-five years ago, but because of recent political events and the ever-connectedness of humans in the digital age, it is now more relevant than ever. </p>
<p><i>So what's the Indiegogo page for?</i></p>
<p>The next step of this very important process involves an equally important person: <b>You</b>. Because we are a brand-new student organization, we don't have the funding and support that other, long-standing production companies possess. We need a little more assistance to get our company off the ground and onto the stage, and contributors like you can make all the difference in the world.</p>
<p>With your help, ATC can begin making a real impact on the USC theatre community and the students involved.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><i>Where does the money go?</i></p>
<p>The Six Degrees production team has set a maximum budget for the production which will not change. The budget is broken down between the costs of scenic design, costuming, venue fees, and other essentials for producing any kind of theatre. Any money raised here will go directly to funding these essential costs of production, even if we do not raise the full $2,000.*</p>
<p><i>*Indiegogo claims 9% of funds if fundraising does not meet the goal amount.</i></p>
<p><i>What do I get out of this?</i></p>Well, first, you get the knowledge that you've helped enrich the lives of countless students and theatre-lovers in the USC community by helping produce a work of art.<br/><br/>But if you're looking for something a little more extrinsic, there are a few unique perks involved in contributing to our cause:<ul>
<li>Every contribution of $10 gets a personal thank you from a member of the ATC board</li>
<li>Every contribution of $25 gets two (2) guests free admission and priority seating to one of our six shows.</li>
<li>Every contribution of $50 gets two (2) guests free admission tickets and priority seating to one of our six shows and two (2) programs signed by the entire cast as a souvenir.</li>
<li>Every contribution of $100 gets two (2) guests free admission tickets and priority seating to one of our six shows and one (1) surprise present from the Six Degrees team!</li>
<li>Every contribution of $250 gets the contributor recognition as an executive producer of Six Degrees Team, along with two (2) free admission tickets and priority seating to one of our six shows.</li>
<li>Every contribution of $500 gets the contributor recognition as a founding investor in the Aenied Theatre Company on future ATC publications including the website and Facebook page; two (2) free admission tickets and priority seating to one of our six shows; and one (1) surprise present from the Six Degrees Team!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<i>How does this help in the big picture?</i><br/><br/>While USC has amazing student organizations devoted to producing a wide variety of theatre, including musicals, new works, and even sketch comedy. However, USC doesn't have the best track record when it comes to regularly producing great non-musical plays, so we at ATC have taken it upon ourselves to fill that niche. In order for this company to thrive and continue expanding the diversity of the theatrical scene here at USC, we need your help. Every dollar raised helps us reach that goal.<p> </p>

<h2><b>About A Midsummer Night’s Dream</b></h2>
<h3><b>Synopsis</b></h3>
<p>The
course of true love never did run smoothly, but who expected fairies and magic
flowers? <br/>
<br/>
On a midsummer’s night, a quartet of mismatched lovers and a band of inept
actors wander into an enchanted forest where they find themselves embroiled in
a dispute between the king and queen of the fairies. Romance, confusion, and
desire all unite as our characters experience the inexplicable magic of love
and the wonder of waking dreams. Some of Shakespeare’s most dazzling, dramatic
poetry is found in this glittering and inventive comedic masterpiece, whose
seriousness is only fleetingly glimpsed beneath its dreamlike surface. </p>

<h2><b>About Alchemy Theatre</b></h2>
<p></p>
<p>Alchemy Theatre Ensemble is an exciting, innovative theatre group, and the amalgamation of the talents and dedication of a group of young actors from across the Lower Mainland. Having met while working together on the Vagabond Players’ production of <em>Goodnight Desdemona (Good Morning Juliet)</em>, the group created something magical – and it wasn’t just the magic on the stage. This production brought together a pool of talented actors whose chemistry was undeniable, and who were drawn together through their mutual desire to produce alternative theatrical works as well as old classics with a new spin.</p>
<p>After officially forming their own theatre group in the spring of 2014, Alchemy Theatre staged their inaugural summer theatre production of <i>Twelfth Night</i> at The Bernie Legge Theatre, a befitting choice since this is where<i>Goodnight Desdemona (Good Morning Juliet)</i> was performed. They are bringing summer theatre back to The Bernie Legge Theatre for a second time with this summer’s Shakespeare production, <i>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</i>, which includes both new and existing Alchemy Theatre members, and look forward to a long tradition of summer theatre.</p>

The artists featured in these concerts includes established and emerging choreographers and dancers.     The Impact of Your Donation Your tax deductible donations will fund the production of these concerts and allow us to continue the growth of contemporary dance in the Brazos Valley. As a non-profit and a member of the Arts Council for the Brazos Valley we have grant funding provided to us but these are matching funds. We must reach our fundraising goal to be able to continue offering quality dance in the Brazos Valley.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>The Show</strong></p>
<p>Power. Kingdoms. Lust. And the Will of one (anti-) hero who
wants to do everything he can to conquer the one enemy he cannot beat:
Death. Based on the epic from Mesopotamia, one of the oldest pieces of
literature known to us today, ""Gilgamesh - A Musical Epic"" is a story
of how Man went from Animal to God, told in the form of an epic musical with a
live band. It brings together the rocky deserts of the mythical Middle East and
the electrifying energy of Rock to challenge the gods themselves.</p>

<p>Peter’s quest began with his decision to direct a musical

<p>Then, much like Gilgamesh, Peter got a crazy idea. But,
instead of searching for the oldest man in the world, Peter decided to direct a
musical that he wrote himself. But who would be the one to join Peter on this

ancient Sumerian epic poem for little to no money a creatively sexy one? Enter

<p>Since its founding in 1999, Clinard Dance Theatre has produced five full works: <em>Quest of Theseus, Shifting Landscapes,</em> <em>Jondo Portraits</em>, <em>Sueño Fuera Del Lugar: An Out of Place Dream</em>, and premiering our newest project, <em>From the Arctic to the Middle East: Broken Narratives by an American Flamenco Dance. </em>Clinard Dance Theatre presents contemporary dance rooted in flamenco, created by collaborators from a diverse range of artistic disciplines and cultural backgrounds. At the center of each work, the company seeks to explore personal and global concerns, connecting the audience to the world through art.</p>
<p>The above video features selections from our most recent project, ""From the Arctic to the Middle East: Broken Narratives by an American Flamenco Dancer."" For our company’s next piece, which will begin its research phase this May, I have chosen the Chicago River as the principal metaphor for the new story I hope to tell. ""The Chicago River is the city's most neglected natural resource. It is overshadowed by Lake Michigan, disdained by environmentalists and outdoorsmen alike, neglected, fouled, and abused by industry and all the rest of us. Nonetheless, it is the second greatest gift that nature has bestowed on this city,"" says Robert Cassidy. The quote above connects directly to what it is about flamenco that holds great meaning to me: that both flamenco and the river contain an ugly, raw, exasperated beauty; a kind of beauty that beacons the observer to seek the unobvious and welcome discomfort. To me, the Chicago River is not beautiful as an expansive view; It is beautiful by her various subtle sought out pictures that carry a history of man's interactions both commercial and design. Old metal remnants of defunct bridges, heron's nests, the frenetic movement of the city above and the bedrock below capture the mechanical, poetic and dramatic understandings I have taken from my life as a dancer/choreographer. I relate to the twists and folds of water likening them to the contractions and spirals that accompany the way I move. The pressures within my body from above and below are like the water sandwiched between air and rock. Being in a small boat on the river simulates the way breath works under my ribcage while dancing. Watching various vessels on the River is watching choreography between barges, speed boats, tour boats, kayakers and canoes.</p>
<p>During the Summer 2010 we likened our studio location at 18th and Halsted to the hub of a wheel. From this hub we made our way outward; north, south, east and west to share our art in our community parks. After researching the history of area parks I tried to make connections between the community, the natural landscapes and my artistic practices. Performance norms were challenged including: pre-show procession-like parading versus traditional marketing, discovering new technical innovations using light and sound, new interactions with an unexpecting public and translating movement and choreography into large and alive spaces. What I learned through these performances is that I became much more interested in finding the connections between my personal artistic practices versus transplanting a prefabricated performance that I created in the studio. The past 15 years have offered much growth in the traditional studio and theatre alike. At present I am curious about how these years of investigation, discipline and growth glean from outdoor, natural spaces and forces that are much larger, both figuratively and literally. I am not interested in outdoor spectacle as much as the understated dialogue between nature and dance. Also the witnessing public holds the potential to be trusted and active, as opposed to entertained.</p>
<p>Current ideas surrounding the Production Phase include finding an outdoor space (be it on the water or the river's bank) where the various natural occurrences allow an improvisatory component to each<br/> performance. Examples are: Studying how the sun lights the space or how a rainstorm allows for a unique movement dialogue with that space. Each performance will intentionally strive to be different due to the elements while the performance space remains static. We hope that the initial parts collected integrate along the way to create a whole story about the Chicago River for our public and interconnected Midwest for the final Production Phase. It will be a story of renewal, a new path to tread on the river. The metaphor of the River is as much about nature as it is about humanity. And the rediscovery of the manifold way in which our lives can be shaped by the recovery of a sense of reverence for life and what we are part of.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need and What You Get</strong></p>
<p><br/> The research phase of the project will focus on researching, exploring, and documenting the Chicago River, cataloguing various perspectives of the River ranging from architectural, design and stories/interviews from Chicagoans, visiting the River at various times of day and weather conditions. With the funds from this campaign, we propose to work with both an outdoor educator and a photographer/designer as I collect my findings. Later phases may require an architect, composer and corps of dancers. Both proposed colleagues offer critical strengths in setting this proposal into action. Charles Stark, Senior Instructor if the REI Outdoor School, offers a knowledge of the human and natural history of the Chicago River. Additionally, he would serve as principal engineer and boat/foot guide in mapping out routes and access points to scout along the river.</p>
<p><br/> In the research phases photographer Laura Prieto- Velsco would photo journal moments in time and place that create dialogue between movement and the many natural occurrences of the river, such as changing light, weather conditions and seasons, all of which alter perception. An example of this came while I was kayaking on the river this summer—rain and shafts of sunlight penetrated an industrial<br/> bridge; I wanted to join in with the rain as a mover and add to the geometry of the bridge with my body. Additionally Laura is a metal-smith and has a keen sense of design that support the intentions of our initial hunting. Through Phase One observations, my job will be to make connections and find patterns that will be carried into the Development Phase where I will work with translating these findings into proportion and rhythm; increment and spatial volume (both pictures that create harmony and horror). I will then try to participate within these frames as a mover or corps of movers to create choreographic links.</p>

Each performance will intentionally strive to be different due to the elements while the performance space remains static. We hope that the initial parts collected integrate along the way to create a whole story about the Chicago River for our public and interconnected Midwest for the final Production Phase. It will be a story of renewal, a new path to tread on the river. The metaphor of the River is as much about nature as it is about humanity. And the rediscovery of the manifold way in which our lives can be shaped by the recovery of a sense of reverence for life and what we are part of.
What We Need and What You Get
 The research phase of the project will focus on researching, exploring, and documenting the Chicago River, cataloguing various perspectives of the River ranging from architectural, design and stories/interviews from Chicagoans, visiting the River at various times of day and weather conditions. With the funds from this campaign, we propose to work with both an outdoor educator and a photographer/designer as I collect my findings. Later phases may require an architect, composer and corps of dancers. Both proposed colleagues offer critical strengths in setting this proposal into action. Charles Stark, Senior Instructor if the REI Outdoor School, offers a knowledge of the human and natural history of the Chicago River. Additionally, he would serve as principal engineer and boat/foot guide in mapping out routes and access points to scout along the river.
 In the research phases photographer Laura Prieto- Velsco would photo journal moments in time and place that create dialogue between movement and the many natural occurrences of the river, such as changing light, weather conditions and seasons, all of which alter perception. An example of this came while I was kayaking on the river this summer—rain and shafts of sunlight penetrated an industrial bridge; I wanted to join in with the rain as a mover and add to the geometry of the bridge with my body. Additionally Laura is a metal-smith and has a keen sense of design that support the intentions of our initial hunting. Through Phase One observations, my job will be to make connections and find patterns that will be carried into the Development Phase where I will work with translating these findings into proportion and rhythm; increment and spatial volume (both pictures that create harmony and horror). I will then try to participate within these frames as a mover or corps of movers to create choreographic links.

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Okay, theater isn't free. Espeically when it's international, multi-media theater.  We're going to need a lot of help on this one.  Here's what we're up against:</p>

<strong>AIRFARE! - </strong>In case you haven't noticed, the Olympics are in London this year which means flying to GB this summer is just NUTZ! It's a steep ticket from sunny LA on a good day, and this year there just isn't a good day. Tickets for each of us are about $1400 EACH. No joke. Help!</div>
<div>
<strong>MATERIALS! - </strong>Part of the plan this year is to travel as light as possible, but there are still some serious material costs that go into making theater magic happen. This piece uses TWO PROJECTION SCREENS which run about $100 a piece. Then there are frames to make for them and figuring out some way to get them overseas. Yikes!</div>
<div>
<strong>POST</strong><strong>CARDS! - </strong>There are THOUSANDS of performances presented at the Fringe every year. How can we stand out? Having tons of beautiful POSTCARDS and POSTERS are a big help.  This isn't a huge expense, but it's very important. And the more we can afford, the better.  Full color ostcards run about $100 for the volume we need, and posters are about the same if we only get a few...</div>
<div>
<strong>LIVING EXPENSES!</strong> - <strong></strong>This, after airfare, is the big one. The Fringe is basically all of August and while we can probably sublet our LA apartments, we'll still have bills to pay back home, plus eating and houshold costs in Scotland. The US dollar doesn't go as far in GB as it does at home. Even modest items add up. Help!</div>
<div> </div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why YOU Should Give</h3>
<p><strong></strong>We believe that live performance is both a powerful and necessary form of expression and we know great shows can change lives. With this piece we are trying something new, and through this challenge we hope to help push our art form into a new era and let its intertia take us along for the ride. This piece is not just theater, it's physical expression, visual storytelling, and imaginative laboratory.  It's a link in the evolution of performance from something presentational to something personal. Supporting this piece means supporting the courage and vision it takes to try new things, and to share those discoveries with the world.</p>
<p>But! If that doesn't float your boat, we can give you stuff too!  We have some lovely perks too offer if you like to keep mementos. :)</p>
<p>Last year, we successfully completed our campaign to support the CalArts shows at the Fringe. Help us go 2 for 2!  ART happens when you give!</p>

<p>We (Aleshea Harris and Ngaire Young) are taking Aleshea's show, <em>Oddlie</em>, to Fringe in the summer of 2012.  We are very proud that it was selected to represent California Institute of the Arts in Scotland.  <em>Oddlie</em> was conceived in Aleshea's hometown of St. Petersburg, FL.  With this show, Aleshea draws on her background as a songwriter, actor and poet to weave this provocative, gritty tale.  Ngaire supports this tale with expert percussion of drums and found instruments.</p>
<p><strong>That's all well and nice, but what's so great about this show?</strong></p>
<p>We believe <em>Oddlie</em> is an important work because it offers a perspective of a marginalized person not often seen in mainstream theatre.  It does this without relying on ""tricks"" or stereotypical interpretations.  Nope, <em>Oddlie</em> is honest, challenging work which we believe should be seen by as many people as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Why should I dig into my pockets?</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, neither of us is a wealthy heiress.  Or a wealthy <em>anything</em>, for that matter.  This is not a trip that we can afford on our own.  Your donations will keep us afloat and fed.</p>
<p><strong>I suppose I can get behind that.  How much money we talkin'?</strong></p>
<p>$5,000</p>
<p><strong>What the-</strong></p>
<p>We know.  In this economy, right?  Here's a break down of how much we need and where it's going:</p>
<p>Two round trip tickets from the U.S. to Scotland-3,000</p>
<p>Fees for housing/venue/etc for two people-2,000</p>
<p>Even if we don't make our goal, we'll split any monies we make between the two of us evenly and hope for the best. But. We will do so with heavy hearts.  You ever seen a poet or a musician with a heavy heart? Not. Pretty.</p>
<p><strong>*Cough*perks?*cough, cough*</strong></p>
<p>We're sooooo glad you asked. We've got CD's of Aleshea's and Ngaire's music, autographed posters, personalized postcards...all kinds of cool stuff to give to our supporters! </p>
<p><strong>You artist types are always trying to get money to make projects.  I need you to convince me this is worth investing in.</strong></p>
<p>We have seen how this play affects people and that's what we're about-change via art. We know <em>Oddlie</em> is an important contribution to the global cultural landscape.  This isn't art for art's sake.  It's for people's sake.  And it's quality work.  Here are links to reviews:</p>

The Process
With Don Juan, we are expanding on our previous work of the French technique L’essential (transmitted to us by Paris based Company Collectif Masque), to include standard Commedia Dell’arte styles, British Pantomime sensibilities, and most importantly an incorporation of Boal’s Theater of The Oppressed. This immense hybridization of form has been another leap for the Bricklayers in their mission to create a mask theatre unique to American audiences.
The Production
Our production is a tantalizing examination of the rift between the haves and have-nots. Our modernization of the Moliere play focuses on Don Juan as a modern day 1% trust-fund baby (much like those on display at Rich Kids of Instigram) living a life of selfish comfort and ease. He’s a character spoiled by privilege and without empathy; who only hopes to spend the rest of his life in frivolous pursuit of the next pleasure. When his father cuts him off, Don Juan is sent into a tailspin, his selfishness, greed, and knack for depravity spiral out of control destroying the stability of those around him, who lack the means to survive such a malignant squall. 

The Bricklayers’ production of Don Juan comically focuses on the trickle down disparity between the American classes and the next generation’s errant disregard for fellow man, by posing the question:
Is the behavior of Don Juan acceptable, and if not, HOW DO WE STOP IT? (a question directly answered by the audience themselves at the end of every performance.)

</div>
<span class=""notranlsate""><div>UPDATE: We've hit our goal, and made it to New York, and performed on the City Centre stage to a sold out house of 2700 people each night. A huge thank-you to all who have helped make this possible for us. The goal has been reached, but every dollar raised beyond helps us now make the most of our Canadian touring in 2013/14, affording flights and hotels, (from Prince Edward Island in November to Whitehorse in the Yukon in February), and of course, getting in extra rehearsal time to prep some great shows!  We are so grateful for your support. Thank-You!</div>

<a href=""http://www.605collective.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">605 Collective</a> (605) is one of Canada's fastest rising dance companies. The artists' premiere performance took place in 2009 at the Dancing On The Edge Festival in Vancouver BC, and just four years later, 605 has grown into a high-caliber and sought-after company, touring extensively throughout Canada and into the US at some of North America's most prominent dance venues and festivals. <br/>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>605 has now received an invitation to perform its newest work at the 10th Anniversary edition of <a href=""http://www.nycitycenter.org/tickets/productionNew.aspx?performanceNumber=7520"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Fall For Dance Festival</i></a> (FFD), hosted by the prestigious <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Center"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">New York City Centre</a> in Manhattan. This incredible opportunity marks 605's NYC debut, and its largest venue to date, performing for over 2700 attendees each night. This year, 605 Collective is one of 20 companies invited from around the world, sharing the stage with the likes of Doug Elkins, The Royal Ballet, Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui, Alvin Ailey, and Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo. FFD is a major platform for showcasing both rising choreographers and legends of contemporary dance. 605 stands to gain tremendous exposure from this engagement, opening new doors that may support future creation projects, and launching the company forward with new international touring opportunities.  </p>

<p>Directly following FFD, the company prepares for its next major Canadian tour, continuing to help build dance audiences in remote communities on the <a href=""http://www.madeinbc.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Made In BC: Dance on Tour</a> network, as well as performing in larger venues in Eastern Canada (see dates below). As a non-for-profit organization, part of our mandate is to bring dance to anyone and everyone, sharing our work with as broad an audience as possible, and we need your help to keep expanding our reach. <br/></p>

UPDATE: We've hit our goal, and made it to New York, and performed on the City Centre stage to a sold out house of 2700 people each night. A huge thank-you to all who have helped make this possible for us. The goal has been reached, but every dollar raised beyond helps us now make the most of our Canadian touring in 2013/14, affording flights and hotels, (from Prince Edward Island in November to Whitehorse in the Yukon in February), and of course, getting in extra rehearsal time to prep some great shows!  We are so grateful for your support. Thank-You!

605 Collective (605) is one of Canada's fastest rising dance companies. The artists' premiere performance took place in 2009 at the Dancing On The Edge Festival in Vancouver BC, and just four years later, 605 has grown into a high-caliber and sought-after company, touring extensively throughout Canada and into the US at some of North America's most prominent dance venues and festivals. 


605 has now received an invitation to perform its newest work at the 10th Anniversary edition of Fall For Dance Festival (FFD), hosted by the prestigious New York City Centre in Manhattan. This incredible opportunity marks 605's NYC debut, and its largest venue to date, performing for over 2700 attendees each night. This year, 605 Collective is one of 20 companies invited from around the world, sharing the stage with the likes of Doug Elkins, The Royal Ballet, Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui, Alvin Ailey, and Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo. FFD is a major platform for showcasing both rising choreographers and legends of contemporary dance. 605 stands to gain tremendous exposure from this engagement, opening new doors that may support future creation projects, and launching the company forward with new international touring opportunities.  


Directly following FFD, the company prepares for its next major Canadian tour, continuing to help build dance audiences in remote communities on the Made In BC: Dance on Tour network, as well as performing in larger venues in Eastern Canada (see dates below). As a non-for-profit organization, part of our mandate is to bring dance to anyone and everyone, sharing our work with as broad an audience as possible, and we need your help to keep expanding our reach. 
What We Need & What You Get:
We need to raise over $2500 to assist with the company's Fall 2013 travel expenses, which include costs for flights and ground transport, extra baggage and shipment for costumes, set pieces, and equipment, and hotel accommodation for 8 travelling company members in each of the visited cities:
605 Collective Fall 2013 Touring Dates:September 27th - 28th, 2013 - Fall For Dance Festival, New York City Center, NYCOctober 20th, 2013 - Dance Allsorts, Roundhouse Community Centre, Vancouver, BCOct 21st-24th, 2013 - Outreach/Community Engagement Residency in Golden, BCOctober 25th, 2013 - Kicking Horse Culture, Golden BCOctober 30th, 2013 - Mount Elizabeth Theatre, Kitimat, BCNovember 2nd, 2013 - Lester Centre for the Arts, Prince Rupert, BCNovember 9th, 2013 - Crimson Coast Dance, The Port Theatre, Nanaimo, BCNovember 14th - 16th, 2013 - DanceWorks, Enwave Theatre, Toronto, ONNovember 20th - 23rd, 2013 - Shadbolt Centre for the Arts, Burnaby, BCNovember 30th, 2013 - Harbourfront Theatre, Summerside, PEIDecember 5th - 7th, 2013 - Live Art Dance, Sir James Dunn Theatre, Halifax, NS
Travelling from coast to coast is expensive for our young company, and costs can add up very quickly. Every dollar raised makes a difference, and your support will help us pull it off. 
About the Perks:

An 8x10 Print of 605 Collective - Choose from one of three photos taken of the company's dancers in action by dance photographer extraordinaire David Cooper. (Please See Gallery for Options) Photo can be signed, or left unsigned, and delivered by Mail to specified address.
Complimentary Tickets to a 605 performance - Claimants can chose from any of the above dates/cities listed, with the tickets (general seating) available at the box office for pick-up under specified name. 



For ""The Big Apple"" Perk Only:

Post-Show ""Meet The Artists"" - Stick around after the performance and meet 605's dancers and crew for a personal thank-you. Ask questions, and learn about the 605's creation process and ""behind-the-scenes"" of a dance performance.  
Can't make it to a show? Rather than tickets, receive a DVD of Archival Performance Footage from one of 605's live dance productions to watch whenever you'd like.

605 Collective has a proven track record of successfully touring and performing its energetic work, reaching thousands of people in 34 cities across Canada/USA with a countless number of shows. By giving to this cause you are helping these young artists take full advantage of their largest opportunity to date. If we are successful beyond our goal with this campaign, all additional funds will be put towards future touring and dissemination. 
All young dancers and choreographers have a goal of sharing their work on a big and beautiful stage, in front of a large audience, and in a cultural hub like New York - you can help us make this a reality.

<p>Hi, my name is Naomi and I am 12 years old. I have been dancing since I was three, and have attended 2 other dance intensives previous to this upcoming summer. I want to become a professional dancer when I grow up, and take every opportunity I can to improve and enhance my dancing and technique. This year, I auditioned for Joffrey Ballet School's summer intensive, and was accepted with a 75% scholarship to attend for 5 full weeks. I know that this intensive is in fact <i>intense </i>and will give me all of the dance training I am hoping to gain this summer, plus some.

<h1>The Chasse-Galerie </h1>
<p>Our Story:</p>
<p>Many moons ago, the good folks at <b>The Red One Theatre Collective</b> came up with the grand idea of bringing the famous French Canadian folk-tale <i>La Chasse Galerie</i> to life at our sometime home <b></b><a href=""www.thestorefronttheatre.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Storefront Theatre </a>at 955 Bloor St., West.  With no more than a desire to create a holiday show that we might present annually, the idea for the story grew and grew, and now we are about to present the first incarnation of this tale—created by the members of the collective and featuring an original score by the enormously talented composer <b>James Smith</b>. </p>
<p>The story of <i>The Chasse-Galerie</i> is as old as the province of Quebec.  In our version, four young Coureurs de Bois (<b>Kat Letwin, Dana Puddicombe, Tess Benger and Shaina Silver-Baird) </b>are trapped deep in the woods of Quebec on a very cold and lonesome New Year's Eve.  Wishing they were back in Montreal to celebrate with their loved ones, they strike up a deal with the Devil himself, who promises to fly them back to Montreal in their Canoe for one night only on the condition they refrain from Blasphemy (All the choicest Quebecois swear words are Blasphemous!)  If they break their promise, the Devil will take their souls.  The heroes take the Devil's deal, but the Prince of Darkness is a wily customer.  The winter nights are long and in the <i>Chasse Galerie</i> anything can happen.</p>
<p><b>Your generous support for this project will help with the cost of renting our venue, providing musical equipment, lights, costumes, and marketing materials. Most importantly however, your dollars will go toward the creation of an original play which we hope to bring back to our audiences in the years to come!</b></p>
<p><b>Come check us out Dec 17-31 (no shows Dec 23-27) at 8pm at The Storefront Theatre, 955 Bloor St. W., Toronto! </b></p>

Our Story:
Many moons ago, the good folks at The Red One Theatre Collective came up with the grand idea of bringing the famous French Canadian folk-tale La Chasse Galerie to life at our sometime home The Storefront Theatre at 955 Bloor St., West.  With no more than a desire to create a holiday show that we might present annually, the idea for the story grew and grew, and now we are about to present the first incarnation of this tale—created by the members of the collective and featuring an original score by the enormously talented composer James Smith. 
The story of The Chasse-Galerie is as old as the province of Quebec.  In our version, four young Coureurs de Bois (Kat Letwin, Dana Puddicombe, Tess Benger and Shaina Silver-Baird) are trapped deep in the woods of Quebec on a very cold and lonesome New Year's Eve.  Wishing they were back in Montreal to celebrate with their loved ones, they strike up a deal with the Devil himself, who promises to fly them back to Montreal in their Canoe for one night only on the condition they refrain from Blasphemy (All the choicest Quebecois swear words are Blasphemous!)  If they break their promise, the Devil will take their souls.  The heroes take the Devil's deal, but the Prince of Darkness is a wily customer.  The winter nights are long and in the Chasse Galerie anything can happen.
Your generous support for this project will help with the cost of renting our venue, providing musical equipment, lights, costumes, and marketing materials. Most importantly however, your dollars will go toward the creation of an original play which we hope to bring back to our audiences in the years to come!
Come check us out Dec 17-31 (no shows Dec 23-27) at 8pm at The Storefront Theatre, 955 Bloor St. W., Toronto!

<h3>THE SHOW</h3>
<p>CAFÉ SARAJEVO is an immersive performance exploring borders that divide and unite us, within the framework of a live podcast. The piece is created and performed by Mariel Marshall, Peter Musante, Lucy Simic and Stephen O’Connell and with stage manager Lisa Humber, creative technologist Jacob Niedzwiecki, and lighting designer Patrick Lavender.</p>
<p>CAFÉ SARAJEVO follows Lucy on a journey of self-discovery, as she travels to her father’s birthplace, Bosnia. Along the way, we explore divided cities and the notion of “human nature”, asking the question: what causes a nation to divide, and begin to hate the very people and culture who, before the dividing lines were drawn, they saw as their own?</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>THE OPPORTUNITY</h3>
<p>bluemouth has been confirmed to present CAFE SARAJEVO at both the M1 Singapore Fringe Festival in Singapore this coming January and in Toronto in February.</p>
<p>We need your help raising $4,000usd to help cover the cost of renting mobile devices to provide 360 video content we shot on Sarajevo. We can’t realize this project without your help! All donations over $25 are eligible for a tax receipt<i> (available upon request!)</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3>M1 SINGAPORE FRINGE FESTIVAL</h3>
<p>The M1 Singapore Fringe Festival (M1 Festival) is an annual festival of theatre, dance, music, visual arts and mixed media created and presented by Singaporeans and international artists. The festival brings the best of contemporary, cutting-edge and socially engaged works to the Singapore audience.</p>

</div></div>","THE SHOW
CAFÉ SARAJEVO is an immersive performance exploring borders that divide and unite us, within the framework of a live podcast. The piece is created and performed by Mariel Marshall, Peter Musante, Lucy Simic and Stephen O’Connell and with stage manager Lisa Humber, creative technologist Jacob Niedzwiecki, and lighting designer Patrick Lavender.
CAFÉ SARAJEVO follows Lucy on a journey of self-discovery, as she travels to her father’s birthplace, Bosnia. Along the way, we explore divided cities and the notion of “human nature”, asking the question: what causes a nation to divide, and begin to hate the very people and culture who, before the dividing lines were drawn, they saw as their own?
 
THE OPPORTUNITY
bluemouth has been confirmed to present CAFE SARAJEVO at both the M1 Singapore Fringe Festival in Singapore this coming January and in Toronto in February.
We need your help raising $4,000usd to help cover the cost of renting mobile devices to provide 360 video content we shot on Sarajevo. We can’t realize this project without your help! All donations over $25 are eligible for a tax receipt (available upon request!)
 
M1 SINGAPORE FRINGE FESTIVAL
The M1 Singapore Fringe Festival (M1 Festival) is an annual festival of theatre, dance, music, visual arts and mixed media created and presented by Singaporeans and international artists. The festival brings the best of contemporary, cutting-edge and socially engaged works to the Singapore audience.

TORONTO
North American premier to be announced soon!!!

 
THE COLLECTIVE
bluemouth collectively creates immersive site-specific performances by marrying choreographed movement, text, immersive sound design, original live music, video, and film to create a cohesive, multi-sensory experience. The various themes of our original performances are multi-layered and strive to be a vital witness to our particular time and place while challenging and exploring new levels of interaction between performers and audiences.
We ask our audience,
“WHAT LEVEL OF EXPERIENCE ARE YOU COMMITTED TO HAVING?”

<b>The Cello of Mr. O, a stunning multidisciplinary performance for all ages!</b>

<p><b></b></p>
<p>At the most fundamental level, <b>The Cello of Mr. O</b> is about the power of music itself. The power to inspire, to unite and to challenge us.

<p>
</p><p>Even when we reach our goal, no one will get rich from this project. You can imagine how much time goes into a complex creative process like this one -- and how dedicated our artists have already proven to be. But everyone has already (and will continue to) contributed time, in-kind services, practices, ideas, help with fundraising, and in so many ways.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>A 30 min. sketch show, Victims of Circumstance explores unfortunate situations that you will be glad you have never had before. A very patient 411 Operator, one really committed Annie, a gay son who has a mother unlike any other, and many more victims ask the question, ""What did I do to deserve this?"" Sometimes you can't control the present, but you can laugh about the past.</p>
<p>This is the first time this show has been brought to a stage here in New York. This show will also be taped and submitted to local comedy theaters in NY in hopes for a run in front of larger audiences.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>
</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are not asking for a lot, only just enough to cover the cost of the theater rental space, because to do this properly, we want to put the show up in the proper space. This is not cheap. The money raised will also go towards the rehearsal spaces that we have used for the cast. It will also go towards any props, wardobe, transportation, food, and any other additional variables that pop up when producing a project such as this.</p>
<p>You will get all of the perks. From the smallest donation to the biggest, you can earn a digital copy of the taped show to as much as a sponsor credit that will be presented in all of our PR for the show. If you help us, we want to help you! We will be promoting this show all over the internet, in restaurants around the theater, and through the theater's promotional website.</p>

<b>THE FOOD CHAIN</b><p></p>
<p>Even almost 20 years after its acclaimed first Off-Broadway run in 1995 at the Wooly Mammoth Theater, <i>The Food Chain</i>'s sharp commentary on self-image, acceptance, and the desperation that follows from a lack of both rings true with present-day audiences. Silver's philosophy of mixing his message with a heavy dose of absurd character-based humor makes for a heavy-hitting comedy that sheds light on the darker side of our insecurities and coping mechanisms.</p>
<div>
<i>But don't take our word for it!</i><p></p>
<p>""In <i>The Food Chain</i>, Nicky Silver's toxic, fractured tale of sex, loneliness and the importance of being thin, the pursuit of love is an even more convoluted process than usual. It's hard, after all, to forge a relationship when all you can really hear is the sound of your own voice. For the poisonously funny, image-obsessed Manhattanites in the play, all the world's a mirror. It's no accident that much of this breathless comedy of neuroses [...] is made up of monologues, even though there are nearly always at least two people onstage."" - <i>New York Times</i></p>
<p><b>SPOON PRODUCTIONS NYC</b></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Spoon Productions is a new collaborative group of artists from varying backgrounds and talents with a common interest/concentration in writing, improvisation, film, and live theatre. Current members consist of Jordan Stovall, Kyra Bromberg, Britta Whittenberg, Shane O’Neill, Joey Pelletier, and Dan Poppy. We met during the completion of the sketch curriculum at the Upright Citizens Brigade Training Center, and continued to meet independently to create and workshop new sketch comedy as the team We Spoon.</span><br/></p>
<p><i>The Food Chain </i>will be our second production after our successful debut of <i>AfterSpoon Delight</i>, a sketch comedy show written, produced, directed, publicized, and acted by the members of Spoon in December 2014. This was our first successful venture to produce a full-length production as a company.</p>
<p>In other words, we love doing this stuff, we're trained to do this stuff, we want to do the stuff, and we'd love to have you seeing us do the stuff. Stuff, stuff, stuff.</p>
<p><b>WHY CONTRIBUTE?</b></p>
<p>As a budding production collaborative with virtually no budget, all expenses will otherwise come out of the pockets of those involved, making new theatre difficult to realize. In order to bring <i>The Food Chain</i> back to life, we are asking for help from others, especially those that are similarly interested in live theatre and comedy, to help make our vision a reality.</p>
</div>
</div><h3>The (Financial) Skinny</h3><h3></h3><p><b>OUR FUNDING GOAL</b></p><p>We are seeking to raise <b>$3,000 in 30 days</b> to get this production on its feet. This budget will fund:</p><ul>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Rights to produce the play</span></li>

THE FOOD CHAIN
Even almost 20 years after its acclaimed first Off-Broadway run in 1995 at the Wooly Mammoth Theater, The Food Chain's sharp commentary on self-image, acceptance, and the desperation that follows from a lack of both rings true with present-day audiences. Silver's philosophy of mixing his message with a heavy dose of absurd character-based humor makes for a heavy-hitting comedy that sheds light on the darker side of our insecurities and coping mechanisms.

But don't take our word for it!
""In The Food Chain, Nicky Silver's toxic, fractured tale of sex, loneliness and the importance of being thin, the pursuit of love is an even more convoluted process than usual. It's hard, after all, to forge a relationship when all you can really hear is the sound of your own voice. For the poisonously funny, image-obsessed Manhattanites in the play, all the world's a mirror. It's no accident that much of this breathless comedy of neuroses [...] is made up of monologues, even though there are nearly always at least two people onstage."" - New York Times
SPOON PRODUCTIONS NYC
Spoon Productions is a new collaborative group of artists from varying backgrounds and talents with a common interest/concentration in writing, improvisation, film, and live theatre. Current members consist of Jordan Stovall, Kyra Bromberg, Britta Whittenberg, Shane O’Neill, Joey Pelletier, and Dan Poppy. We met during the completion of the sketch curriculum at the Upright Citizens Brigade Training Center, and continued to meet independently to create and workshop new sketch comedy as the team We Spoon.
The Food Chain will be our second production after our successful debut of AfterSpoon Delight, a sketch comedy show written, produced, directed, publicized, and acted by the members of Spoon in December 2014. This was our first successful venture to produce a full-length production as a company.
In other words, we love doing this stuff, we're trained to do this stuff, we want to do the stuff, and we'd love to have you seeing us do the stuff. Stuff, stuff, stuff.
WHY CONTRIBUTE?
As a budding production collaborative with virtually no budget, all expenses will otherwise come out of the pockets of those involved, making new theatre difficult to realize. In order to bring The Food Chain back to life, we are asking for help from others, especially those that are similarly interested in live theatre and comedy, to help make our vision a reality.

The (Financial) SkinnyOUR FUNDING GOALWe are seeking to raise $3,000 in 30 days to get this production on its feet. This budget will fund:
Rights to produce the play
Renting out the Treehouse Theatre for a 4-week, 8-show run of the production
Sets, lighting, sound, costuming, and other technical requirements
Rehearsal space
A small marketing budget to increase public interest

The North Carolina Comedy Arts Festival (http://www.nccomedyarts.com/) was founded in Chapel Hill, NC, in 2001 as an improv showcase and workshop opportunity. It's grown into one of the largest improv festivals in the southeast, and it attracts performers and instructors from all over the country.
CRAB&LOBSTER (Ian Custar and Kris Purushothaman, gentlemen-at-large) applied to the festival back in September 2015, and we got accepted! Somewhere on this page, you can view our video submission and see why.

What Does This All Mean?

CRAB&LOBSTER is everyone's favorite crustacean-titled longform improv comedy duo. Ian and Kris (omnipotent child-emperors) got accepted to perform in the North Carolina Comedy Arts Festival in Chapel Hill, February 11th-14th, and we need your help paying for the trip. Here's what your funding with your donation:
  Registration fees, hotel room, workshops at the festival, fancy show tickets, gas (Atlanta to Chapel Hill and back!), food, bear mace, disguises, and definitely not bail money.  But What's In It For Me?

TWO-FOLD ANSWER. A) You get the warm, fuzzy feeling knowing you helped support two Atlanta improvisers hone their craft and spread their brand of weird joy. B) Prizes. Wizard-themed prizes.  We've got a bunch of perks for different donation amounts.
These perks are all wizard-centric.
To be clear, our two-man show is not about wizards necessarily; we just really like doing wizard impressions, and we want to share that joy with you.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

I am reaching out now for your support to get we live in space  up and running. There is some work to do, and I hope you can help out!

Primarily, I am seeking to raise funds to install a sprung dance floor in the studio; and to cover costs for a small amount of renovation work. 


This studio will be a home base for Meg Wolfe Dance; for events and residencies; and will also support the broader community through low-cost rentals for rehearsals. we live in space will provide a place for choreographers to explore and refine their work; and a place for artists and audiences to connect.


What We Need & What You Get
I am asking for your support with these costs:
- lumber & other materials for the floor- paint, plaster, rollers, etc- mops, buckets, brooms, cleaning supplies- replacing an old toilet & floor linoleum- removing old flourescent lighting, rewiring for new lights- replacing a broken window- replacing broken doorknobs & locks

The Impact
On the most basic level, your contribution will help sustain dancers in their work. Dancing on a sprung dance floor minimizes the wear and tear on our bodies that can occur working on hard floors with no give.
Being able to keep rental rates low nourishes and encourages a community of choreographers working in Los Angeles.
Beyond that, the impact of having a home base, to be part of the fabric of a neighborhood, to find new intersections of ideas, dreams, and dancing, is huge.

Risks
This is something I have been thinking about and working towards for a many years.

<p>""Six Months of Winter"" is a new original comedy by Cody Sanders about a young, queer couple and the first six months of them living together. They struggle through different hurdles and they have some less than helpful sources of advice: their meddling friends, self-involved family members and even the local god-like radio DJ. It is a tumultuous six months, but they learn at the end that spring always comes after winter. </p>
<p>We at CodAko Entertainment are producing this play as our first entry into the Capital Fringe Festival in July 2019. It is our largest and most ambitious project yet, with the opportunity to reach a wider audience than we've ever had. We will be performing in Capital Fringe's Plum Theatre in the Arena Stage building in SW DC.</p>
<p>Performance dates:</p>
<ul>
<li>July 12th  @ 7:30pm</li>
<li>July 14th @ 8:00pm</li>
<li>July 21st @ 12:30pm</li>
<li>July 25th @ 5:30pm</li>
<li>July 28th @ 12:30pm</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p>To put on a full production we are buying/building all set pieces, props and costumes. And with gods as characters we have some elaborate plans for these, therefore our budget is much bigger than usual. Also being a part of the Capital Fringe Festival comes with its own fees. We are hoping to raise about $2500 to cover these costs.</p>
<p>But we also want to give back and have several perks for those who donate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Those who donate $5 or more will have their names printed in the program </li>
<li>Donate $10 or more and you'll get a shout-out on social media to any personal or professional page</li>
<li>If you donate $25 or more you'll get invited to a special preview event with food and drink</li>
<li>For $50 you will get a ticket to the show</li>
</ul>
<p>We are very excited about this play and our premier in the Capital Fringe Festival. Since founding CodAko Entertainment we have been passionate about creating and showcasing important queer art. ""Six Months of Winter"" is a new kind of queer art: queer art that affirms identity while showcasing toxic behaviors within the community. We've been working on this story for years and are ready to bring it to a mainstream audience.</p>
<p>If you are not able to donate but still want to help out, there are plenty of ways you can participate. First, you can share this campaign to friends and family. You can also follow us on social media: CodAko Entertainment on Facebook and @codako_dc on Twitter and Instagram. You can also just come and see the show and enjoy it.

<i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Hawthorne</i><br/>
</h3>
<div>In Portland, Oregon - city of sodden dreams - a private investigator wrestles with her past's attempts to become her present. Whether she's diving down the rabbit hole or climbing up the chain of command, she can't stop until she finds the truth. And we all know how well that usually goes...</div>
<div>
<i>Hawthorne, </i>running May 12th through June 4th at Action/Adventure Theatre, is an original play by A/A company members Aubrey Jessen and Greta West, written through collaboration with a brilliant team of actor/devisors.  By using the structures and tropes familiar to film noir and pulp detective novels, <i>Hawthorne</i> explores what it means to navigate a world that is filled with traps we built ourselves - the unsafe, unsettled feeling of generalized anxiety that so heavily influences both film noir and an awful lot of people's lives.</div>

We're best known for our ""theatre for TV people"" serialized shows - a new episode of an ongoing story each weekend, bringing together the best parts of scripted work and improvisation (a story with a definite beginning, middle and end, AND exciting, in-the-moment dialogue). <i>Hawthorne </i>is Action/Adventure's second original, fully-scripted play - after last year's beautiful and successful <i>How to Stop Dying</i> by company member Noah Dunham, we were inspired to keep exploring the possibilities of applying our creative team's energy to a more traditional scripted play format. The results have been overwhelming, and we can't wait to share them with you. Our team of astonishing collaborators includes the cast: <b>Zoe Rudman, Jade Hobbs, Ellery Jessen, Cassie Skauge, Beth Summers, Jake Simonds, Michael Zimmer, and Andrew Haftkowycz; </b>the design team: <b>Lucas Welsh, Richard Moore, Dan Minzer, Tyler Buswell, and Jade Harris</b>; Stage Manager <b>Kelsie Johnson</b>; and our devising team: <b>Stephanie Cordell, Brian Kuwabara, Justine Davis, Katie Watkins, and Jed Arkley.</b>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Action/Adventure is in the extremely rare position of having spent most of our years almost entirely funded by ticket sales. This is a pretty glowing testament to our relationship with our audience, but it also puts an inherent ceiling on the scope of our shows. Without asking too much of our audience by raising ticket prices, it limits our ability to compensate our collaborators in a way that reflects the magnitude of their talents and time. We are asking for $5,000 - your help will take the cost burden off of ticket sales and let us go deeper and bigger with our design elements. Our tremendously talented team is working to create a multi-media immersive world for our characters (seriously - sound, lights, projections, set, costumes - all so amazing). Every contribution will go directly toward production costs like equipment rentals, material purchases, and - most critically - artist stipends. Any amount is helpful toward this end, and it will all go to offset costs and pay artists even if we fall short of our $5,000 goal. By helping, you become an invaluable part of this team, and teammates get gifts! </p>

</div></div>","Hawthorne

In Portland, Oregon - city of sodden dreams - a private investigator wrestles with her past's attempts to become her present. Whether she's diving down the rabbit hole or climbing up the chain of command, she can't stop until she finds the truth. And we all know how well that usually goes...

Hawthorne, running May 12th through June 4th at Action/Adventure Theatre, is an original play by A/A company members Aubrey Jessen and Greta West, written through collaboration with a brilliant team of actor/devisors.  By using the structures and tropes familiar to film noir and pulp detective novels, Hawthorne explores what it means to navigate a world that is filled with traps we built ourselves - the unsafe, unsettled feeling of generalized anxiety that so heavily influences both film noir and an awful lot of people's lives.

<h3>A little background </h3>
<p>Hello! For those who don't know me my name is Kat Wellman and I've recently graduated with a Bachelors in Technical Theatre. Theatre is something that I'm passionate about and have been lucky enough to pursue. Although I was born in Alaska, I grew up in Germany, and then moved to England to pursue my passion for backstage work. </p>
<p>Now I need to save up enough to apply for a new visa to stay in the UK to continue pursuing my dreams and working toward my goals. It's a lot for a student and with the impact of Covid, funds are always tight. </p>
<p>Contributing to this would help me achieve the goals that I've been working towards for three years and help me to start off on this truly amazing career path. Anything at all would be immensely helpful to me and I would forever be grateful.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What do I need?</h3>
<p>The downside of being an international in the UK is that staying is incredibly difficult...especially when funds are low. The application fee for a graduate route visa (Which will allow me to work in any capacity of Theatre for two whole years!) is £700 alone. Additionally theres a Healthcare Surcharge for both years of the visa which comes to £1.248. All of that together plus postage and additional documents comes out to about £2.000. </p>
<p>This is why I've decided to ask for help, it's a lot of money to try to save by myself at the moment and any little bit that can be spared would be amazing. Wether you're my family and would like to give a small graduation present or anyone who can spare a small bit, it all adds up. If I don't reach my entire goal then that's perfectly okay, I'm still going to use whatever money I do raise to fund at least part of the application process</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why do I need this?</h3>
<p>Technical Theatre is not only something I'm passionate about but something that I excel at. Being able to pursue my dream and kick off my career would not only mean the world to me, but also change the entire course of my future. </p>
<p>This is a huge opportunity for me and I would appreciate any help at all to make my dreams a reality.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<p>If you can't donate anything that's completely fine. I know times are tough and I don't want to ask anything of anyone who isn't in a place to help. But if you could share and tell people who are in that position it would mean a lot. Thank you so much for reading and helping!</p>

<h3>What is this?</h3>
<p>The Apt Show: Haunted House of Capitalism is about showcasing local indie artists with live performances and installation art. There'll be snacks, entertainment and a whole lot of fun. All funds raised will be split between the 6 artists equally, as well as paying for any decorations/tech needed so that these artists don't have to pay out of their own pocket and are reimbursed for the hours that they have spent prepping.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why are you asking for money?</h3>
<p>At Thumbs Up Good Work Theatre we believe that artists should be paid for their art, their hard work and their efforts. With our previous shows we have found that the artists are just barely breaking even.</p>
<h3>What do you need $800 for?</h3>
<p>Ideally, we would like to give each artist $100 to reimburse them for any incurred costs on tech rental, props, costumes and the time the have spent prepping and creating their pieces for the show! No matter what we raise, each artist will receive an equal share of the amount raised, and a portion will be used to cover decorations, advertising, props and items for the installation art pieces.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>I can't donate, but I want to help!</h3>
<p>Great! Thank you for believing in our project. If you can't donate money, we would also love old halloween decorations, bags of candy, or just a share and a like. You can check out our Facebook page Thumbs Up Good Work Theatre.</p>

We were founded in 2006 and compete around the nation from California to Florida keeping the Gujarati tradition and culture alive not only on stage but also around Duke University's campus.</span></p><p>We have had success in past competition winning competitions such as Miami Mayhem and Aag Ki Raat and placed at several others.</p><p>We are currently a club sport, however, because of renovations around campus, we are looking for support from the community to keep our successful seasons coming. With your help, we are looking at towards our two first major goals: getting new costumes from India and winning our first competition of the the spring, Raas Mania at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. Then we are going to Dallas for Southern Methodist University's Raas Rave &amp; Bhangra Blitz competition.</p><p>We need $2500 just for our first competition at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champlain, Raas Mania but we expect we'll need $5000 in fundraising to make our season a success and $3500 for Raas Rave. If we reach our goal of $1500, we can be sure that we will be able to go to our first competition, Raas Mania! But this is just a start and we could use all the help you can give.<br/></p><p>We put in a ton of time a week on top of our already busy class schedules. All we need is your support so that our costumes look as good as we do and that we can get to Illinois in February.</p><br/><h3>What is Raas-Garba?</h3><p> Raas-Garba is set of traditional dances from the Indian province of Gujarat performed during Navarati. These include Garba, Raas and Tran Taali. These dances started as communal dances were everyone would dance in celebration of Durga.</p><p>We have moved the dance from this setting and onto stage as we perfected and energized the dance. In America, this grew into a competition circuit, especially at the college level, where different teams compete to see who has best kept the spirit of Navaratri alive while impressing the audience.</p><br/><h3>Our Short Term Goals</h3><p>As we've mentioned, right now we need to pay for competitions and costumes.</p><p>Getting to competitions is clearly our top priority, but it is also expensive. Even past paying for entering the competition itself, reaching the competition and reserving hotel rooms for twenty people can cost more than a thousand dollars per competition.</p><p>Right now, we're looking towards our next competition, but this is just one of our spring competitions. Included in our fundraising goal is the entirety of our competition costs of Raas Mania in February to ensure we can afford to compete. Although we plan on driving to Illinois, we still need to pay for hotels, dues and gas money to get there.</p><p>We estimate just this competition to cost $2000-2500, $1000-1200 to help us fly there and $1000-1200 for hotel costs with $100 set aside for competition costs and other expenses.</p><p>SMU's R2B2 competition will likely cost us $3500 with $2500 spent out of pocket for plane tickets and about $1000 on hotel accommodations.</p><p>In addition, we have had our current costumes for three years and they are beginning to become dilapidated. After use in our competitions and around campus, the detailing on these outfits are starting to go. If possible, we would like to replace these before they become unusable. However, we get our costumes custom-made from India, which causes the costs to rise. In order to get enough costumes for our team and to get them made right, we estimate the cost of replacing our costumes to be $1000-1250.</p><p>If you could help us reach half of what we need, we would be very grateful although if you can help us with this competition and costumes, it will open us to larger competitions later in the season.</p><h3>Longer-Term Goals</h3><p>Even this is just one of the competitions we going to over the course of the year. We plan on needing $10,000 to successfully compete in all of the competitions we want to and to get new costumes. That is, even beyond Raas Mania and costumes, there is until plenty of room for you to help. We continue going to competitions throughout the spring and then start again next year with more competitions.</p><p>Club dues cover nearly half of what we need, but it is still not enough to compete everywhere we would like. As a college organization with a still small alumni base, we need your support and the help of the community to accomplish all that we set out to this season.</p><p>We have had successful seasons in the past and with your support we can bring it even further as we go to even more competitions. In the past we've won at competitions such as Miami Mayhem, even placing third in our most recent competition, University of South Carolina's Aag Ki Raat.</p><p>Help us do what we love and keep Raas on the rise. We can't do it without you!</p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Even if you can't donate, there are plenty of ways to help. Please share our page with others or with organizations that can support us. Further beyond, money if you have any means of helping us get our costumes or reach or competition, please feel free to contact us.</p><p>If you can help us with fundraising on campus, please contact us so we can find out more at dbsraasfundraising@gmail.com</p><br/><p>Thank you for your support!</p><p>DBS Raas</p>Abhishek Balakrishnan, Sruti Pisharody, Pramodh Ganapathy, Anna Knight, Ashwin Kommajesula, Daiana Dai, Eshita Singh, Alekhya Sure, Deepika Potarazu, Helen Murphy, Kavya Durbha, Komal Kinger, Nicole White, Alisha Pope, Parth Chodavadia, Pooja Mehta, Priyanka Kanal, Raj Sikaria, Becky Holmes, Rhea Chitalia, Jordan Lucore, Roshni Prakash, Sagar Patel, Shreyas Bharadwaj, Swetha Iruku, TJ Ciesla, Vaishali Oza and Vandana Kumar.<p></p></div>","About UsWe're Duke Daal Baath Shaak Raas, Duke's premier raas-garba competitive team.

Then we are going to Dallas for Southern Methodist University's Raas Rave & Bhangra Blitz competition.We need $2500 just for our first competition at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champlain, Raas Mania but we expect we'll need $5000 in fundraising to make our season a success and $3500 for Raas Rave. If we reach our goal of $1500, we can be sure that we will be able to go to our first competition, Raas Mania! But this is just a start and we could use all the help you can give.We put in a ton of time a week on top of our already busy class schedules. All we need is your support so that our costumes look as good as we do and that we can get to Illinois in February.What is Raas-Garba? Raas-Garba is set of traditional dances from the Indian province of Gujarat performed during Navarati. These include Garba, Raas and Tran Taali. These dances started as communal dances were everyone would dance in celebration of Durga.We have moved the dance from this setting and onto stage as we perfected and energized the dance. In America, this grew into a competition circuit, especially at the college level, where different teams compete to see who has best kept the spirit of Navaratri alive while impressing the audience.Our Short Term GoalsAs we've mentioned, right now we need to pay for competitions and costumes.Getting to competitions is clearly our top priority, but it is also expensive. Even past paying for entering the competition itself, reaching the competition and reserving hotel rooms for twenty people can cost more than a thousand dollars per competition.Right now, we're looking towards our next competition, but this is just one of our spring competitions. Included in our fundraising goal is the entirety of our competition costs of Raas Mania in February to ensure we can afford to compete. Although we plan on driving to Illinois, we still need to pay for hotels, dues and gas money to get there.We estimate just this competition to cost $2000-2500, $1000-1200 to help us fly there and $1000-1200 for hotel costs with $100 set aside for competition costs and other expenses.SMU's R2B2 competition will likely cost us $3500 with $2500 spent out of pocket for plane tickets and about $1000 on hotel accommodations.In addition, we have had our current costumes for three years and they are beginning to become dilapidated. After use in our competitions and around campus, the detailing on these outfits are starting to go. If possible, we would like to replace these before they become unusable. However, we get our costumes custom-made from India, which causes the costs to rise. In order to get enough costumes for our team and to get them made right, we estimate the cost of replacing our costumes to be $1000-1250.If you could help us reach half of what we need, we would be very grateful although if you can help us with this competition and costumes, it will open us to larger competitions later in the season.Longer-Term GoalsEven this is just one of the competitions we going to over the course of the year. We plan on needing $10,000 to successfully compete in all of the competitions we want to and to get new costumes. That is, even beyond Raas Mania and costumes, there is until plenty of room for you to help. We continue going to competitions throughout the spring and then start again next year with more competitions.Club dues cover nearly half of what we need, but it is still not enough to compete everywhere we would like. As a college organization with a still small alumni base, we need your support and the help of the community to accomplish all that we set out to this season.We have had successful seasons in the past and with your support we can bring it even further as we go to even more competitions. In the past we've won at competitions such as Miami Mayhem, even placing third in our most recent competition, University of South Carolina's Aag Ki Raat.Help us do what we love and keep Raas on the rise. We can't do it without you!Other Ways You Can HelpEven if you can't donate, there are plenty of ways to help. Please share our page with others or with organizations that can support us. Further beyond, money if you have any means of helping us get our costumes or reach or competition, please feel free to contact us.If you can help us with fundraising on campus, please contact us so we can find out more at dbsraasfundraising@gmail.comThank you for your support!DBS RaasAbhishek Balakrishnan, Sruti Pisharody, Pramodh Ganapathy, Anna Knight, Ashwin Kommajesula, Daiana Dai, Eshita Singh, Alekhya Sure, Deepika Potarazu, Helen Murphy, Kavya Durbha, Komal Kinger, Nicole White, Alisha Pope, Parth Chodavadia, Pooja Mehta, Priyanka Kanal, Raj Sikaria, Becky Holmes, Rhea Chitalia, Jordan Lucore, Roshni Prakash, Sagar Patel, Shreyas Bharadwaj, Swetha Iruku, TJ Ciesla, Vaishali Oza and Vandana Kumar.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Over the next few months, we intend to bring the NYU community together in an

together on a project with the cast containing students from four of NYU's schools.
The collaboration that happens when performers of these different backgrounds come
together is something truly outstanding, with every single person bringing something
completely unique to the process. This year, we have taken that idea of cross-school
collaboration and have attempted to maximize its full potential, with students from six
of NYU’s schools being represented in our cast and on our production team.
We're thrilled to welcome students from Tisch (Drama, Film & TV), Steinhart (Vocal

<p>I'm a spoken word artist, playwright, filmmaker, journalist, blogger, author, food and health justice organizer, gender rights activist, and medicine maker/herbalist. I'm also ending a year term as an Americorps VISTA member/community health organizer where I took a vow of poverty while serving low-income communities of color on Austin's East Side.</p>
<p>I began my journey as a playwright while living in West Oakland and had the reading of my first play, Genderqueer Files: La Qolectiv@, in Austin this year for the Mi Casa es Su Teatro portion of our local, fringe festival- FronteraFest.  It was the highest grossing and highest attended play for this section of the festival. Genderqueer Files: La Qolectiv@ brought out people of all colors, genders, and sexualities and created much-needed dialogue in the community. Not bad for a brown, queer, play in spanglish. The play is now a community workshop.</p>
<p>Genderqueer Files: La Qolectiv@ is a sci-fi tale that follows a multi-racial group of queer, radical activists who find strength and guidance from their ancestors in order to dismantle a system that thrives off gender and racial exploitation. (<em>Read the monologues:</em> <a href=""http://issuu.com/toiscott/docs/monologues"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Here</a>)</p>

<p>My writings are an extension of the life I live as a community organizer and activist committed to justice, equity, and freedom for all marginalized folks. Queer. Brown. Women. Genderqueer. All those who feel voiceless or invisible. My writings are a tool for healing and liberation. They are meant to open a space for cross-cultural, intergenerational dialogue that sparks collective action across difference . By examining all of who we are we are able to address multiple layers of oppression faced by the various communities that we are a part of.</p>
<p>These writings have helped me to heal by allowing me to work through my own oppression and re-examine and reclaim my multi-ethnic heritage and deep roots that span from the Americas, to the Caribbean, Africa, Spain and other parts of the Mediterranean and as far east as India.</p>

<p><span>This play is all about reclamation and resistance. For far too long, we've been denied our histories and forced to forget our roots and expected to assimilate. Afro-Boricuas and Tainos, especially those inhabiting queer bodies, have a rich history of political and cultural radicalism that is seldom told. Weaving together the stories of characters that embody contemporary countercultures, feminist and anarchist historical figures, and African and Taino ancestry, <em>Sangre: Resistencia</em> will help us uncover the more hidden side of the Island's rich culture of dissent.<br/></span></p>
<p><span><br/></span></p>
<p><em><strong>Reclamation is healing. Healing is resistance.</strong></em></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<h2><strong><strong><strong><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Who is Resistencia: Sangre for?<br/></span></strong></strong></strong></strong></h2>
<p><span>This isn't for broadway or fancy, inaccessible bookstores with coffeeshops in fast gentrifying areas. This is for the <strong>People</strong>. I want to bring this to queer communities of color, our families, friends and allies. <br/></span></p>
<p><span><em>Resistencia: Sangre</em> is meant to inspire dialogue that recognizes the significance of incorporating our spiritual roots, cultural ancestry and political heritage into our collective struggles to create a world free from exploitation.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>While <em>Resistencia: Sangre</em> focuses on a specific group of Black and Brown Puerto Ricans, the themes addressed within are relevent to peoples of all racial/ethnic identities who are engaged in a struggle to dismantle oppressive hierarchies of power and reclaim their humanity.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>Indigenous, Australian (Murri) artist and activist Lilla Watson once said:</span></p>
<p><em>""If you have come here to help me, you are wasting our time. But if you have come because your liberation is bound up with mine, then let us work together.""</em></p>
<p>Our liberation is bound up together. And as Martin Luther King, Jr. said:</p>
<p>""Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.""</p>
<p>When we listen to each others' stories we begin to understand the complexities that have led to our oppression, our roles in the oppression of others, and what it will take as a larger community to heal from and transfrom a system based on suppression, invisibilizing, and invalidation.</p>
<p>Just as it took hundreds of years of careful crafting for this ridiculous system to dominate the world, it will be a slow process to dismantle it.</p>
<p>It starts with compassionate and transformational dialogue and blossoms into strategic action.</p>

I'm Toi, a storyteller, community organizer and artivist, and I'm asking the community- the People- to support the first steps in my research for my second community play and novel (*and possibly graphic novel) entitled Resistencia: Sangre which will take you, the co-authors, deep into exploration of Afro-Boricua and Taino identity and spirituality while also exploring liberation- Puerto Rican independence and anarchy. We follow a group of radical, queer independentistas involved in Puerto Rico's underground movement and  music scene  who are interested in the dismantling of the current system and the collective liberation of the island's People. The group find out that their current story is the continuation of a much older story- a history of slave revolts, indigenous resistance, and rebellion told in a parallel by their ancestors and radical predecessors.
About Me and My Work:

I'm a spoken word artist, playwright, filmmaker, journalist, blogger, author, food and health justice organizer, gender rights activist, and medicine maker/herbalist. I'm also ending a year term as an Americorps VISTA member/community health organizer where I took a vow of poverty while serving low-income communities of color on Austin's East Side.
I began my journey as a playwright while living in West Oakland and had the reading of my first play, Genderqueer Files: La Qolectiv@, in Austin this year for the Mi Casa es Su Teatro portion of our local, fringe festival- FronteraFest.  It was the highest grossing and highest attended play for this section of the festival. Genderqueer Files: La Qolectiv@ brought out people of all colors, genders, and sexualities and created much-needed dialogue in the community. Not bad for a brown, queer, play in spanglish. The play is now a community workshop.
Genderqueer Files: La Qolectiv@ is a sci-fi tale that follows a multi-racial group of queer, radical activists who find strength and guidance from their ancestors in order to dismantle a system that thrives off gender and racial exploitation. (Read the monologues: Here)
     
My plays address themes of gender, sexuality, spirituality, ancestry  heritage, accessing our inner power, autonomy, and interdependence.

My writings are an extension of the life I live as a community organizer and activist committed to justice, equity, and freedom for all marginalized folks. Queer. Brown. Women. Genderqueer. All those who feel voiceless or invisible. My writings are a tool for healing and liberation. They are meant to open a space for cross-cultural, intergenerational dialogue that sparks collective action across difference . By examining all of who we are we are able to address multiple layers of oppression faced by the various communities that we are a part of.
These writings have helped me to heal by allowing me to work through my own oppression and re-examine and reclaim my multi-ethnic heritage and deep roots that span from the Americas, to the Caribbean, Africa, Spain and other parts of the Mediterranean and as far east as India.
About Resistencia: Sangre
In Resistencia:Sangre you'll listen to the silenced voices of Afro-Puerto Ricans, Tainos and their ancestors through the story of queer musicians, organizers and visionary community members committed to their island's liberation. While searching for their own autonomy and independence they stumble upon suppressed histories, tragedy, triumph and Truth. Experience the music and magic.

The Characters:
An interesting mix of punk band members, organizers and activists, artists, community members and visionaries and all are about decolonization, ending ""the Struggle"", and their oppression and reclaiming their birthright: Freedom.
There will be scenes with their African, Taino, and even Spanish, ancestors, healers, and scenes with anarchist, feminist, and other radical and powerful predecessors. And the play will integrate the following themes...
Main themes:

 

Liberation
Independence/Interdependence
Autonomy/Sovereignty

Trans and Queer identity and injustice

LGBT/Queer Rights
Afro-Puerto Rican Identity (*in spanish, see above link for an english video)
Taino (indigenous) Identity
Land rights
Environmental Justice
Economic justice
Gender justice
 
 
I'm super excited about the birth of this play as all of these themes contain elements of my personal history and I know that you will be excited with the outcome, too.
 
Why Resistencia: Sangre is important
             
This play is all about reclamation and resistance. For far too long, we've been denied our histories and forced to forget our roots and expected to assimilate. Afro-Boricuas and Tainos, especially those inhabiting queer bodies, have a rich history of political and cultural radicalism that is seldom told. Weaving together the stories of characters that embody contemporary countercultures, feminist and anarchist historical figures, and African and Taino ancestry, Sangre: Resistencia will help us uncover the more hidden side of the Island's rich culture of dissent.

Reclamation is healing. Healing is resistance.
 
Who is Resistencia: Sangre for?
This isn't for broadway or fancy, inaccessible bookstores with coffeeshops in fast gentrifying areas. This is for the People. I want to bring this to queer communities of color, our families, friends and allies. 
Resistencia: Sangre is meant to inspire dialogue that recognizes the significance of incorporating our spiritual roots, cultural ancestry and political heritage into our collective struggles to create a world free from exploitation.
While Resistencia: Sangre focuses on a specific group of Black and Brown Puerto Ricans, the themes addressed within are relevent to peoples of all racial/ethnic identities who are engaged in a struggle to dismantle oppressive hierarchies of power and reclaim their humanity.
Indigenous, Australian (Murri) artist and activist Lilla Watson once said:
""If you have come here to help me, you are wasting our time. But if you have come because your liberation is bound up with mine, then let us work together.""
Our liberation is bound up together. And as Martin Luther King, Jr. said:
""Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.""
When we listen to each others' stories we begin to understand the complexities that have led to our oppression, our roles in the oppression of others, and what it will take as a larger community to heal from and transfrom a system based on suppression, invisibilizing, and invalidation.
Just as it took hundreds of years of careful crafting for this ridiculous system to dominate the world, it will be a slow process to dismantle it.
It starts with compassionate and transformational dialogue and blossoms into strategic action.

</h3><p>Pulp Productions: we are a small band of students and professionals, troubadours and tragedians, brought together by our shared vision of what theatre--its organization and its presentation--ought to be. We are committed to an open, collaborative creative process, in which all are encouraged to share their ideas and listen earnestly to others in the building of character, craft, and authentic connection. And we strive, above all, for truth. </p>
<p>Our latest project is J. M. Barrie's <i>The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up,  </i>more commonly known by its colloquial title, <i>Peter Pan.</i> However tempting it may be, one should not confuse this work with Disney's appropriation. Barrie's <i>Pan</i> is a sensitive and insightful exploration of imagination, the borderlands of childhood, and what we leave behind when we grow up.</p>

We are committed to an open, collaborative creative process, in which all are encouraged to share their ideas and listen earnestly to others in the building of character, craft, and authentic connection. And we strive, above all, for truth. 
Our latest project is J. M. Barrie's The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up,  more commonly known by its colloquial title, Peter Pan. However tempting it may be, one should not confuse this work with Disney's appropriation. Barrie's Pan is a sensitive and insightful exploration of imagination, the borderlands of childhood, and what we leave behind when we grow up.

<span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">My name is Scott Dehn and I own Golden Age Cinemas, LLC which operates the McHenry Outdoor Theater.  Some of my fondest memories as a child are of attending The McHenry Outdoor Theater with my parents, my sister and my grandmother.  As a six year-old, I could hardly comprehend the concept of watching movies on such a huge screen outside under the stars.  I recall watching ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" while sitting on my grandmothers lap in the back of our family's station wagon.  I remember explaining to her what had happened in the last Indiana Jones adventure.  I remember the smell of the blanket she cuddled me up in.  </span><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">I remember loving the dancing food items on the intermission reel.  Most of all, </span><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">I remember feeling so safe and loved amongst my family in this unique setting.  It was moments like this that remain with me to this day.  I fell in love with movies and this particular theater from that day on.</span>

</div></div>","My name is Scott Dehn and I own Golden Age Cinemas, LLC which operates the McHenry Outdoor Theater.  Some of my fondest memories as a child are of attending The McHenry Outdoor Theater with my parents, my sister and my grandmother.  As a six year-old, I could hardly comprehend the concept of watching movies on such a huge screen outside under the stars.  I recall watching ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" while sitting on my grandmothers lap in the back of our family's station wagon.  I remember explaining to her what had happened in the last Indiana Jones adventure.  I remember the smell of the blanket she cuddled me up in.  I remember loving the dancing food items on the intermission reel.  Most of all, I remember feeling so safe and loved amongst my family in this unique setting.  It was moments like this that remain with me to this day.  I fell in love with movies and this particular theater from that day on.

Today, I find myself blessed to be in a position to help provide memories like those I experienced as a child to a whole new generation of families.  I get to see the looks of awe and excitement on the children's faces as they arrive at the theater to see their favorite cartoon character or superhero on the big screen.  I know, however, that as the years go on it will be the time and moments spent here with their family and friends that they will cherish the most.

This show deserves to be seen across the country -- and the continent."" </em>Pat Donnelly, The Gazette</p>
<p>In her award-winning solo show, Johanna Nutter tells the extraordinary and true story of her brother’s pregnancy. As she tries to put aside the role of family caretaker and live her own life, her transgender sibling is preparing to bring a child into the world he is not sure that he can parent alone. With barely more than a piece of chalk to set her stage, Nutter traces a portrait of a unique family, drawing us into her fight to assert her own identity and ultimately illustrating the universal struggle of following our own dreams while being there for those we love.</p>
<p><em>“Brilliant and moving<strong>…</strong>a profoundly wonderful play.”  </em>Karen Muir<em>,</em> <em>CBC Radio</em></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>my pregnant brother </em></strong>is Freestanding’s flagship production and Johanna's first play. After winning the best of the Montreal Fringe Festival in 2009 and a subsequent MECCA for best text, the show began touring Canada. Perfectly bilingual, Nutter translated her play into French and presented both versions at La Licorne Theatre in 2010 (a first for the francophone theatre), winning a COCHON D’OR award for best Independent Production in Quebec and following up with a performance at the ProPulse Festival in Belgium; the only Canadian show to be invited.</p>
<p>Now, the show has been invited to the Pleasance theatre for the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, followed by a week at the SOHO Theatre in London. This is wonderful news and it comes at a price. Both theatres operate on box office splits of 60/40, so there are no guarantees and no financial support prior to showtime. At the same time, an outlay of about $15 000 CND is required to properly fund this tour. Accommodations and travel are expensive, plus we have hired an award-winning communications company to ensure that we don't get lost in the sea of shows at the world's biggest theatre festival. We have applied to the Canada Council for the Arts in the hopes of obtaining some assistance, and we are here; asking for your help as well. </p>
<p>Along with the personalized eco-friendly perks that Johanna has promised, a donation to our project will also mean that a young and energetic company will have the resources to make Montreal, Quebec, and Canada proud. Time and time again, <em><strong>my pregnant brother</strong></em> has won over the communities it plays for, creating relationships that we will carry with us into the future. We are working diligently to promote our special brand of simple, intimate, integral, and reciprocal theatre: our latest show, Jeremy Taylor's <em><strong>Big</strong> <strong>Plans</strong></em> was a resounding success at this past SummerWorks festival, winning awards for Taylor and for Tanner Harvey, its director. This tour will not only open up further opportunities for <em><strong>my pregnant</strong><strong> brother</strong></em>, it will also pave the way for our upcoming productions.</p>
<p>If you would like to support us financially--amazing!--we greatly appreciate your contribution. If you feel like helping out but don't have the monetary means, please do share this campaign (or if you know someone with a spare bedroom in Edinburgh for the month of August, Johanna is still looking). Also, if you're in Montreal on the 10th of June, there will be a special fundraiser evening at Mainline Theatre with back-to-back performances <em>en français</em> at 19h00 and in English at 9pm.
