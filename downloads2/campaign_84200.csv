<p>Thanks for being here and a part my campaign. Some of you may know me from my years touring and playing in the studio with some very famous artists.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm <a href=""http://www.willpayneharrison.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Will Payne Harrison</a>. I have been writing songs for a long time, but I believe that these 12 songs that I am about to record may be the best I've ever written. I'm very proud of this next record and the musicians that I have on the project. If you aren't familiar with me here's a bit about me:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am an Americana/Roots songwriter and artist in Nashville, TN.</li>
<li>I host a podcast on songwriting in Nashville called <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/americanastation"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Americana Station</a>.</li>
<li>I'm a Libra and I like long walks on the beach at sunset.</li>
<li>I have spent the last three years touring the US, writing songs and spending every last dime on my craft.</li>
<li>Here are a few quotes from some press on my last album:</li>
</ul>
<p><i>""Easy, clean and humble, this, his follow-up to Louisiana Summer, is well-written but simple.""</i> - <strong>Offbeat, New Orleans, LA</strong></p>
<p><i>""Harrison follows in the footsteps of his heroes, telling stories that can make you smile right before they make you cry. Willie Nelson and John Prine would be proud.""</i> - <strong>Mother Church Pew, Nashville, TN</strong></p>
<p><i>""East Nashville Blues lets Will Payne Harrison get 'Lost in the Sway' on a weaving fiddle run as he ponders a 'Strange Contradiction' regarding life in the fast lane, and quietly walks down Woodland Avenue into 5 Points after a night of drinking asking a companion to 'Stay with Me'.""</i> <strong>- The Alternate Root Magazine, Los Angeles, CA</strong></p>
<p><i>""Harrison has unveiled smooth, sweet vocals to match the heartfelt lyrics on the new album.""</i> - <strong>Herman Fusilier, The Daily Advertiser, Lafayette, LA</strong></p>
<h3>Living With Costs</h3>
<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p>
</div><div>
<p>Here's the cold hard truth:</p>
<ul>
<li>In order to record this album, I need <strong>$6000 </strong>alone just for recording space, production, hiring musicians and mixing. </li>
<li>A PR campaign costs around<strong> $4,000 </strong>(Heard your favorite band in that magazine or blog? That's what PR is for!)</li>
<li>Merchandise costs will be <strong>$2000</strong>.</li>
<li>That's around <u><strong>$12,000</strong></u> for a conservative estimate in cost to produce this album.</li>
<li>I have been saving up for this record, and have drained my bank account. In order to make this record work, I need at least <strong>$5,000</strong> in support to move forward. I'm not asking you for the entire amount, but  I am humbly asking for your help to get to my goal.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>By donating to this campaign, you will help keep me on the road promoting the album!</li>
<li>By relieving some of this financial burden, I will be able to focus on radio tours, growing my fan base and making sure everyone in the recording process gets a fair wage.</li>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>

<h2>Hola, soy Isra (@isramusica), cantante y vocal coach venezolano.</h2>
<p>Desde pequeño, inicié mis estudios como cantante con diferentes profesores y entrenadores vocales; todos de amplia trayectoria en Venezuela.</p>
<p>Asimismo, para nadie es un secreto que provengo de una familia rodeada de músicos, de manera que la música forma parte de mi vida desde que nací: mis padres se conocieron gracias a la música.</p>
<p>Por un lado, mi mama es cantante coralista, perteneció a la Schola Cantorum de Venezuela durante muchos años y formó parte del grupo instrumental de la Universidad Simón Bolívar; por otro, mi papá es licenciado en música, productor musical y arreglista, ex integrante de la Schola Cantorum de Venezuela, del grupo instrumental de la USB, ganador de La Siembra del Cuatro, músico de la reconocida agrupación venezolana Serenata Guayanesa, actualmente director y arreglista del grupo coral Ave Fénix, entre otras cosas.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>TRAYECTORIA</h3>
<p>Para el año 2013 se me presentó la oportunidad de audicionar en el Grupo Tártara, reconocida agrupación venezolana,  y de  inmediato comencé a formar parte de los cantantes principales, lo que me llevó a compartir tarima en muchas ocasiones con artistas venezolanos de la talla de la superbanda de Venezuela Guaco, Aditus, La Matarica, Grupo EA, Oscar de León, Oscarcito, Victor Drija, Victor Muñoz, Jonathan Moly, Gustavo Elis, Corina Smith, entre otros; e internacionales como Maluma. </p>
<p>Toda esta experiencia, me permitió rodearme de personas muy talentosas y me abrió las puertas del medio artístico de Venezuela, motivo por el cual decidí iniciar mis proyectos personales: (1) en conjunto con dos amigos fundé la ‘coverband’ Tono 3 (@tono3music), una agrupación conocida por sus arreglos de muy alto nivel vocal y musical, que me hizo crecer aún más como artista y me generó otras oportunidades, como poder tener un tema principal en uno de los más recientes dramáticos de Venevisión, “Para verte mejor”. La canción se llama ‘Volverás’ y es el sexto promocional del cantante venezolano Fran Strippoli en colaboración con Tono 3; (2) formar parte, como vocalista principal, de ‘La Marcha’, bajo el liderazgo del reconocido productor y compositor venezolano José Alfonso Quiñones, agrupación que logró posicionarse con el número uno en la Cartelera Nacional de Pop y en el Top 100 nacional del Record Report con el tema ‘I wanna feel the boom boom’.</p>
<p>Actualmente soy el director vocal de la banda de Corina Smith (@corinasmith), soy el director vocal de la agrupación Emusic (@emusicve), me desempeño como vocal coach de Shantal Marsuian (@shantalmarsuian), Marielen (@marielen.oficial), el dúo Los Muchachos (@losmuchachosmusica) y Corina Smith; y, en paralelo, me encuentro trabajando arduamente en mi proyecto musical como solista, estimando que el lanzamiento del primer tema promocional se lleve a cabo para el segundo trimestre de este año.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>'Isra' EL PROYECTO</h3>
<p>Con este proyecto, pretendo combinar el género urbano con un sonido anglo muy internacional que combina elementos del pop y el R&amp;B que reflejan mi identidad como cantante, para poder enseñarles quién soy a través de mi música y cumplir todas la expectativas del público a nivel nacional e internacional.</p>
<p>Los fondos recaudados serán destinados a la producción de la imagen artística, diseño y producción del show, producción audiovisual, introducción del producto (primer sencillo promocional) al mercado, promoción radial en las principales carteleras a nivel nacional, prensa y gira de medios.</p>
<p>Durante mucho tiempo, como integrante de grupos bailables, como corista o como vocal coach he vivido mi sueño a partir del sueño de otras personas. Ha sido una experiencia increíble, he conocido gente maravillosa, he aprendido muchísimo y definitivamente me he formado como artista. Pero creo que llegó la hora de apostar a mi proyecto, a mis ideas y a mi propuesta. Nada es fácil, pero tampoco es imposible; tal y como me ha enseñado siempre mi familia: el trabajo es la mejor forma de progreso.</p>

The North and South American musicians function astoundingly as one team with a unified artistic goal. </p><p>The project is complex, and involves a lot of people in many places. Recording, mixing, mastering, fees, production, and promotional expenses are formidable on a high quality CD.

I’ve been immersed in all of these for most of my life. But it’s really more about community than category.It's a celebration of values that we all share -  looked at from several perspectives. There are pieces about Bali, New York, India, Brazil, New Orleans, Africa, and Patagonia. The more I write, play and travel, the more vivid these connections become. ​ This is an exciting adventure that requires coordination, vision, and careful planning. The basic tracks were done in Buenos Aires and additional recording is being done in New York.Contemporary technology facilitates easy sharing of musical files across continents and allows me to maintain a cohesive concept of the project’s artistic statement. The North and South American musicians function astoundingly as one team with a unified artistic goal. The project is complex, and involves a lot of people in many places. Recording, mixing, mastering, fees, production, and promotional expenses are formidable on a high quality CD.

<strong>Introducing the sequel to <i>MFTRSP: Volume I.</i></strong><br/> </h3><h3>**This campaign is on ""fixed"" funding - so it's all or nothin,' baby!  The album will only be born with YOUR help!</h3><p> </p><p><i>(A personal letter from RAINBOW about the making of this 'fempowering' project:)</i></p><p> </p><p>Dear sweet musical dreamer,</p><p>After a 13 year perfectionism-and-self-doubt-induced songwriting hiatus, fairy muses interrupted the children’s book I was writing &amp; illustrating to bestow two volumes of heart-wide-open folk &amp; folkpunk songs upon my Dulcimer &amp; me, where we sat unexpectantly at The Rainbow Sparkle Palace... </p><p>It’s been one year since your support launched my debut album, Volume I of Music From The Rainbow Sparkle Palace. I could crawl out of my screamin' skin with excitement over sharing part 2 of that musical story with you.</p><p>ALL of this happens with your support, for your eyes, for the joy that arises in the collective consciousness when we are supported in living our creative dreams. Thank you for making this possible. </p><p>Here's the juicy background on the journey, for your reading pleasure...</p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>The Music</h3><p>MFTRSP: Volume II has been in the works for nearly two years!  It is a bit different from its predecessor, with a stronger folk-punk connection &amp; a full-fledged 'PARENTAL ADVISORY' label. </p><p>This brand new auditory journey features an existential crisis, feminist anthems, a domestic violence survival story, and powerful tales of love; its beautiful beginning &amp; epic end. The full-length album (18 tracks and counting!) is flanked by field recordings of myriad wildlife in the woods at my tiny house &amp; homestead, The Rainbow Sparkle Palace, and ends on a high note, with <i>'Sun Song,'  </i>the happiest tune I've ever written, which ends in proclamation</p><p><i>""I'm alright, I'm alright, I'm alright...""</i></p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>The Concept</h3><p>The concept for the album &amp; its execution is based in authenticity.  The songs are unapologetic, even when vulnerable &amp; soft as kitty fur.  They are raw in their birthing; many tracks you'll discover are the song <i>as it was being born</i>. I literally felt it coming, grabbed my phone and instrument, and hit record.</p><p><strong>What you hear is as real, fresh, and raw as it gets.</strong></p><p>You'll find refreshingly minimal post production here, yet I can honestly tell you this record will sound as good on your car stereo as the first, professionally recorded, mixed &amp; mastered MFTRSP: Volume I. </p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>The Feminism</h3><p>I want this project to empower women &amp; femusicians, in as many ways I can squeeze from it (and I hope you want that too. When women are uplifted, everyone wins!)</p><p><strong>How you will empower women by backing this project</strong>:</p><ul>
<li>Employing women &amp; women-run companies for every step of this process (yes, I even wrote each major digital distributor &amp; CD manufacturing company to find which employed the highest percentage of women, at the highest ranking position). </li>
<li>Launching an uber-economical yet badass-sounding record proves to women (who suffer globally lower wages &amp; are far underrepresented in the music industry) that successful musicianship can be achieved despite financial difficulty</li>
<li>Supporting a record that speaks out about domestic violence and sexual harassment shines light on the dark, and eradicates it from hiding. This powerful motion facilitates healing for DV survivors (statistically, mostly women), and is a movement toward social change.</li>
<li>Financially facilitating my fempowering professional music video for 'Patriarchy Song,' (a self-produced project, inviting women the world over to alchemize #metoo moments into nourishing fuel, and challenging social taboos regarding female nudity), fuels a powerful global movement toward healing humanity through honoring the divine feminine &amp; her power to turn dark to light.</li>
<li>Because 10% of profits for the lifetime of this record go to Hope's Wings, a local Domestic Violence Shelter,  you are aiding vital efforts to free women from the enslavement of violent relationships.</li>
</ul><p> </p><p> </p><h3>The Album Art</h3><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">A</span><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> dreary winter forest - spring on the horizon. Facing the camera in vintage breezy dress, cupped hands blow glitter stars at you.  Shininess emerges from the dark. </span></p><p>Ariana Jordan is photographing this scene during our music video shoot.  The stars will be collaged (by me! Yay, art degree coming in handy!) onto the printed photo, then scanned in.  Abby Marium, who helped with album art for Vol. 1, will duplicate the text we used for that record, for continuity, and add it to the new art in Adobe Illustrator.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>The Music Video</h3><p>Have you ever felt stifled, oppressed, and after decades of it clawing at you, it dawned on you a way to start feeling free?</p><p>That's what 'Patriarchy Song,' the first single &amp; bigger-budget music video for MFTRSP: Vol. 2 is about.  Women worldwide are being invited to participate virtually, or in person; anonymously or not, in an alchemizing ritual where #metoo moments are magically reborn as nourishing fuel. </p><p>Women will present their #metoo moments on poster, then toss them into a burning wood stove, which will heat our meal.  We'll sit together eating and enjoying each other's company, then take the ashes from the stove and fertilize an oak sapling we will plant together.  Women the world over are mailing in bits of ashes from their own private rituals, which will be added to our group ashes during planting. </p><p>I've gotten deep, heartfelt letters of gratitude from several participants, relaying horrifying stories, and assertions that this event is healing them and giving them hope.  The video will be shot by Ariana Jordan on March 13 &amp; 14 in special outdoor spaces near Berea.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>The Budget</h3><p>So, what does it take to make an album?  Even an uber-low-budget record like this takes a lot of work. </p><p>Times have graciously shifted in favor of the musician, and it's been a dream come true to  release my music independently under my own record label, <strong>Rainbow Sparkle Palace Publishing</strong> (est. 2018 via BMI).  Not being signed to a label gives me a folkton of freedom, and it means that I alone am responsible for funding my music; making every single detail run smoothly, and promoting my music solo.  It's been an 80 hour per week job, studying 'the new music industry' &amp; building my music business over the last 3 years, all while working part-time as an entrepreneur cleaning houses &amp; organizing for local clients.  It really feels like I'm in a self-run college for music marketing.   </p><p>It's a cat-ton of work &amp; responsibility!</p><p><strong>But I've found the reward of making music FOR &amp; WITH my fans makes it the kind of work that fuels me li'l soul. </strong></p><p>Music From The Rainbow Sparkle Palace: Vol. I released in August 2018; for financial &amp; practical reasons, I decided not to release a double volume debut album all at once.  With your help, though, we can make this happen in Spring 2019. </p><p>It's important to be transparent (perfectionism is a killer) and let ya know the challenges I face as an independent musician.  I'm uber-grateful to fans who have supported me in the past (we raised $2500 in the campaign for Volume I last year!), and have continued to purchase music and merchandise between releases, which allowed this album to be made!</p><p><strong>Y'ALL KEEP THIS MUSIC KICKIN'. </strong></p><p>For a detailed Budget Outline, <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LUF2ebQl7m-TXv2GU4kdYy_KNgp3nxDavy8RXgF-its/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">click here.</a></p><p> </p><h3>How You Can Be Involved</h3><h3>

Introducing the sequel to MFTRSP: Volume I. **This campaign is on ""fixed"" funding - so it's all or nothin,' baby!  The album will only be born with YOUR help! (A personal letter from RAINBOW about the making of this 'fempowering' project:) Dear sweet musical dreamer,After a 13 year perfectionism-and-self-doubt-induced songwriting hiatus, fairy muses interrupted the children’s book I was writing & illustrating to bestow two volumes of heart-wide-open folk & folkpunk songs upon my Dulcimer & me, where we sat unexpectantly at The Rainbow Sparkle Palace... It’s been one year since your support launched my debut album, Volume I of Music From The Rainbow Sparkle Palace. I could crawl out of my screamin' skin with excitement over sharing part 2 of that musical story with you.ALL of this happens with your support, for your eyes, for the joy that arises in the collective consciousness when we are supported in living our creative dreams. Thank you for making this possible. Here's the juicy background on the journey, for your reading pleasure...  The MusicMFTRSP: Volume II has been in the works for nearly two years!  It is a bit different from its predecessor, with a stronger folk-punk connection & a full-fledged 'PARENTAL ADVISORY' label. This brand new auditory journey features an existential crisis, feminist anthems, a domestic violence survival story, and powerful tales of love; its beautiful beginning & epic end. The full-length album (18 tracks and counting!) is flanked by field recordings of myriad wildlife in the woods at my tiny house & homestead, The Rainbow Sparkle Palace, and ends on a high note, with 'Sun Song,'  the happiest tune I've ever written, which ends in proclamation""I'm alright, I'm alright, I'm alright...""  The ConceptThe concept for the album & its execution is based in authenticity.  The songs are unapologetic, even when vulnerable & soft as kitty fur.  They are raw in their birthing; many tracks you'll discover are the song as it was being born. I literally felt it coming, grabbed my phone and instrument, and hit record.What you hear is as real, fresh, and raw as it gets.You'll find refreshingly minimal post production here, yet I can honestly tell you this record will sound as good on your car stereo as the first, professionally recorded, mixed & mastered MFTRSP: Volume I.   The FeminismI want this project to empower women & femusicians, in as many ways I can squeeze from it (and I hope you want that too. When women are uplifted, everyone wins!)How you will empower women by backing this project:
Employing women & women-run companies for every step of this process (yes, I even wrote each major digital distributor & CD manufacturing company to find which employed the highest percentage of women, at the highest ranking position). 
Launching an uber-economical yet badass-sounding record proves to women (who suffer globally lower wages & are far underrepresented in the music industry) that successful musicianship can be achieved despite financial difficulty
Supporting a record that speaks out about domestic violence and sexual harassment shines light on the dark, and eradicates it from hiding. This powerful motion facilitates healing for DV survivors (statistically, mostly women), and is a movement toward social change.
Financially facilitating my fempowering professional music video for 'Patriarchy Song,' (a self-produced project, inviting women the world over to alchemize #metoo moments into nourishing fuel, and challenging social taboos regarding female nudity), fuels a powerful global movement toward healing humanity through honoring the divine feminine & her power to turn dark to light.
Because 10% of profits for the lifetime of this record go to Hope's Wings, a local Domestic Violence Shelter,  you are aiding vital efforts to free women from the enslavement of violent relationships.
  The Album ArtA dreary winter forest - spring on the horizon. Facing the camera in vintage breezy dress, cupped hands blow glitter stars at you.  Shininess emerges from the dark. Ariana Jordan is photographing this scene during our music video shoot.  The stars will be collaged (by me! Yay, art degree coming in handy!) onto the printed photo, then scanned in.  Abby Marium, who helped with album art for Vol. 1, will duplicate the text we used for that record, for continuity, and add it to the new art in Adobe Illustrator.  The Music VideoHave you ever felt stifled, oppressed, and after decades of it clawing at you, it dawned on you a way to start feeling free?That's what 'Patriarchy Song,' the first single & bigger-budget music video for MFTRSP: Vol. 2 is about.  Women worldwide are being invited to participate virtually, or in person; anonymously or not, in an alchemizing ritual where #metoo moments are magically reborn as nourishing fuel. Women will present their #metoo moments on poster, then toss them into a burning wood stove, which will heat our meal.  We'll sit together eating and enjoying each other's company, then take the ashes from the stove and fertilize an oak sapling we will plant together.  Women the world over are mailing in bits of ashes from their own private rituals, which will be added to our group ashes during planting. I've gotten deep, heartfelt letters of gratitude from several participants, relaying horrifying stories, and assertions that this event is healing them and giving them hope.  The video will be shot by Ariana Jordan on March 13 & 14 in special outdoor spaces near Berea.  The BudgetSo, what does it take to make an album?  Even an uber-low-budget record like this takes a lot of work. Times have graciously shifted in favor of the musician, and it's been a dream come true to  release my music independently under my own record label, Rainbow Sparkle Palace Publishing (est. 2018 via BMI).  Not being signed to a label gives me a folkton of freedom, and it means that I alone am responsible for funding my music; making every single detail run smoothly, and promoting my music solo.  It's been an 80 hour per week job, studying 'the new music industry' & building my music business over the last 3 years, all while working part-time as an entrepreneur cleaning houses & organizing for local clients.  It really feels like I'm in a self-run college for music marketing.   It's a cat-ton of work & responsibility!But I've found the reward of making music FOR & WITH my fans makes it the kind of work that fuels me li'l soul. Music From The Rainbow Sparkle Palace: Vol. I released in August 2018; for financial & practical reasons, I decided not to release a double volume debut album all at once.  With your help, though, we can make this happen in Spring 2019. It's important to be transparent (perfectionism is a killer) and let ya know the challenges I face as an independent musician.  I'm uber-grateful to fans who have supported me in the past (we raised $2500 in the campaign for Volume I last year!), and have continued to purchase music and merchandise between releases, which allowed this album to be made!Y'ALL KEEP THIS MUSIC KICKIN'. For a detailed Budget Outline, click here. How You Can Be Involved

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>River City Worship has worked hard over the years to write songs that speak hope, drawing worshippers further into intimacy and awe of our incredible Savior. Our desire is to continue writing songs relevant to where people are at by helping put words to their pain, their struggles, their opportunities, and their tomorrow. Through these songs, we explore the depths of God's character and focus our attention and hope on Him. We have dreamed of opportunities to keep recording these ""anthems"" so that people can continue singing them long after the event is over.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This album is a continuation of that dream coming true. It is more than just a musical project; we believe it is a glimpse into the divine, an opportunity to loudly sing the anthems that God has gifted to River City Church. We believe we have an opportunity to capture a moment that will continue to change lives for years to come.</p>
<p>We need $25,000 to cover the live sound engineering, media company shooting video, and the post-production costs which will give the album that final professional touches. We are utilizing Indiegogo and our recording event to help fund this project. Your preorders and desire to attend the event will help us with the cost required to record and deliver songs from River City Worship.</p>
<p>All of the resources given to River City Worship will go directly to funding the filming, recording, and production of this much-anticipated project. All financial gifts are considered charitable giving and tax-deductible.</p>
<p>We also have a handful of unique perks that I think you will enjoy.  </p>
</div><div><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3></div><div><p>We will have a lot of work to do leading up to the live recording event, and even more work to do afterward.  We are looking forward to the challenge and are grateful that you've taken the time to check this out.</p></div><div>

</div></div>","The Y B ÷ Movement and our message:Y B ÷ is a socially-minded, San Diego based apparel  company whose mission is to ignite a global movement to Harmonize Humanity. The Y B ÷ logo poses the question - Why Be Divided? Whether these divisions are racial, religious, political, national, or within ourselves. Seeing the Y B ÷ logo sparks a moment of clarity and introspection that transcends the divisions throughout our world and inspires tolerance and positivity. When you wear a Y B ÷ shirt or hat you tell the world you stand for peace, compassion, unity, equality, acceptance and love. 
            Our Story:
Y B ÷ started two and a half years ago after Founder, Steve Leisher traveled to Nicaragua in search of truth and purpose. With newfound inspiration, perspective and the support of his family, Y B ÷ took flight with humble beginnings. After producing a limited amount of apparel we received an overwhelmingly positive response from the community, local retailers, non-profits, musicians, artist, and via social media internationally. We knew we were on to something truly meaningful and powerful and we want YOU to help spread this positive vibration and what people are calling the new peace sign of our times!! Throughout this last year Y B ÷ has been organizing for widespread acceptance and has rapidly grown a galvanized fan base of 51k+ Facebook and 26k+ Instagram followers. With a newly designed website we are poised for our first major round of production and ready to make a huge splash in 2015!
Our Products:Y B ÷ offers apparel that has an immediate attraction and appeal to people of all ages and backgrounds. Our designs are colorful, fun, thought-provoking and timeless and are intended to generate a smile and a shift in consciousness. We pride ourselves in providing complimentary, comfortable and quality products that are meant to inspire a positive action. 

Our Goals:
We here at Y B ÷ embrace the motto 'Reach For The Stars' and dream... BIG!!  It is our purpose to be the unified voice that raises awareness to the many divisions that are present in the world today.  We intend to encourage the efforts of the many organizations and individuals who strive to expose these illusions of division. A major goal of Y B ÷ is to create collaborative efforts with non-profits working for social and environmental harmony to design products that raise money and awareness for their important work. With your support Y B ÷ has no shortage of inspiration and passion to continue to create new products and marketing avenues to further spread our message and effect positive change for the world in which we wish to live in today.

<p>This year The Slackers have been around for 25 years and Ernesto’s has been in existence for 26 years, perfect timing to organize their 27th concert at Ernesto's that took place on Monday, November 21, 2016. After 2 earlier live CD's it’s time to celebrate this union with a 3rd recording (even on vinyl). That is, if you support our plan and spend a few bucks on our crowdfunding-campaign to realize this live-CD/LP. As reward: a memory for eternity.</p>
<h3>Ernesto's</h3>
<p>Next to being a great and very cosy Mexican restaurant Ernesto’s is also a infamous stage for maverick musicians. Bands like La Troba Kung Fu, Los de Abajo, The Slackers, The Skatalites, M.D.C., The Paladins, Jaya The Cat as well as “local” heros like The Wolff, Mo'Jones, the WW-Band and the Janse Bagge Bend have played here. Even though they might attract bigger in clubs or even stadiums most bands return as often as they can because they enjoy the interaction and bonding with the crowd. </p>
<h3>Ernesto himself</h3>
<p>The creative power behind this place is Ernesto America. Born and raised in Sittard with genuine Mexican roots (or is that caused by tequila intake) he has been connected with music and hospitality form an early age on. ""My love of music started on the infamous stage of pop music called Donkiesjot in my hometown. My former band the WW-Band was also founded there. It wasn’t long after that that I brought a tray of tequila shots into the dressing room of The Slackers, who decided pretty soon after that to play in my bar. That gig was recorded and one thing led to another. Together with Jan van Montfort and Rino Vincken, owners of record shop Music Machine, and Rob Driessen of 3Sun Recordings, I started my own record label in 2004”.</p>
<h3>The Slackers</h3>
<p>The Slackers are self-styled masters of Reggae, Ska and Rock’n’Roll from New York City. They began in 1991 in NYC. After years of local gigs and rehearsing in a dingy basement in Manhattan’s lower east side, the band released its debut album in 1996. The band’s success resulted in the re-lease of a second album in 1997. Since then The Slackers have released 14 more albums amongst which 3 live albums (Live at Ernestos, Upsettin' Ernestos, Slack in Japan), several EPs and numerous singles and compilation tracks. Since 1997 The Slackers have played yearly over 100 shows on all continents of the world and abroad. The band’s musical style is distinctly from their contemporaries; a mix of early Jamaican music with classic 50’s and 60s American styles. There are influences from 50s and 60s Rock’n’Roll, Rythmn and Blues, Jazz and Latin music. Singer Vic Ruggiero has coined the term ‘Jamaican Rock’nRoll.’ to describe it. With the demise of record companies over the last 5 years, The Slackers have suc-cessfully used crowdfunding to release new music including the latest release, The Slackers [self-titled] in February 2016.</p>
<h3>De crowdfunding campaign</h3>
<p>There’s that certain kind of chemistry brewing between Ernesto's and The Slackers. Every year the New York boys visit the small town of Sittard, their home away from home. Their European tours nowadays mostly end with a homecoming concert in Ernesto’s. This year The Slackers have been around for 25 years and Ernesto’s has been in existence for 26 years, perfect timing to organize their 27th concert. After 2 earlier live CD's it’s time to celebrate this union with a 3rd recording (possibly even on vinyl). That is, if you support our plan and spend a few bucks on our crowdfunding-campaign to realize this live-CD/LP.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Recording and producing a CD/LP requires an investment so we need your help. Support our crowdfunding-campaign and you will of course be rewarded. Irrespective of your donation, our gratitude will be immeasurable! Dependent on the size of your donation we also bring joy to your ears with heavenly notes via MP3, CD or vinyl, accompanied by a stunning cover and exclusive booklet. This special booklet will be exclusively given to those who support our campaign. It will NOT be sold together with the CD/LP in shops later on.</p>
<h3>Recordings &amp; Party</h3>
<p>As Ernesto stated himself:  “It’s my goal to bring parties together to have a party.” The party and the recording of the album took place November 21st at Ernesto’s. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What is the production investment?</h3>
<p>Costs live recordings € 2500,- (already spent) Costs technical facilities € 1000,- Costs CD's/LP's production, covers, booklets, inlays € 4500 (min 500 ) Costs rights, design promo € 2000,- Total investment: € 10.000,-</p>
<h3>What can we achieve together?</h3>
<p>All our benefits are stated here. You can be as rude and reckless as you want; for 10 bucks you will get a download link to exclusive MP3-materiaal, for 20 bucks you will get a CD recording and for only 30 bucks you will be able to add a new LP to your record collection. Your donation will be returned to your account if we don't reach our goal. If our donations exceed the targeted amount we will spend the money on getting The Slackers to the release party of the CD/LP in the spring of 2017. Possible exceeding amounts after that, will be given to a charity-organization with a musical purpose.</p>
<h3>Record label</h3>
<p>The CD and LP will be released under the Music Machine Records label. The recordings are done by 3Sun Recordings. The release is planned in the spring of 2017. Music Machine and Ernesto's have already produced several live recordings of The Slackers and other artists like La Troba Kung Fu and The Paladins.</p>
<h3>Spread the word</h3>
<p>So spread the word and help us! Donate, share and spread the news. Choose one of the options and use social media tools to spread this perfectly innocent and fun musical virus. For more information send us an e-mail. Stay informed and like us on our Facebook-page.</p>

That is, if you support our plan and spend a few bucks on our crowdfunding-campaign to realize this live-CD/LP.
What We Need & What You Get
Recording and producing a CD/LP requires an investment so we need your help. Support our crowdfunding-campaign and you will of course be rewarded. Irrespective of your donation, our gratitude will be immeasurable! Dependent on the size of your donation we also bring joy to your ears with heavenly notes via MP3, CD or vinyl, accompanied by a stunning cover and exclusive booklet. This special booklet will be exclusively given to those who support our campaign. It will NOT be sold together with the CD/LP in shops later on.
Recordings & Party
As Ernesto stated himself:  “It’s my goal to bring parties together to have a party.” The party and the recording of the album took place November 21st at Ernesto’s. 

What is the production investment?
Costs live recordings € 2500,- (already spent) Costs technical facilities € 1000,- Costs CD's/LP's production, covers, booklets, inlays € 4500 (min 500 ) Costs rights, design promo € 2000,- Total investment: € 10.000,-
What can we achieve together?
All our benefits are stated here. You can be as rude and reckless as you want; for 10 bucks you will get a download link to exclusive MP3-materiaal, for 20 bucks you will get a CD recording and for only 30 bucks you will be able to add a new LP to your record collection. Your donation will be returned to your account if we don't reach our goal. If our donations exceed the targeted amount we will spend the money on getting The Slackers to the release party of the CD/LP in the spring of 2017. Possible exceeding amounts after that, will be given to a charity-organization with a musical purpose.
Record label
The CD and LP will be released under the Music Machine Records label. The recordings are done by 3Sun Recordings. The release is planned in the spring of 2017. Music Machine and Ernesto's have already produced several live recordings of The Slackers and other artists like La Troba Kung Fu and The Paladins.

Because of its chronic progressive nature, insidious onset, complicated and diverse motor and non-motor symptoms and limited management options Parkinson’s is one of the most challenging diseases.Parkinson’s Australia is the national not-for-profit body working to support and advocate for all people affected by Parkinson’s and other movement disorders. Our mission is to create an environment that is responsive to the needs of all people affected by Parkinson’s. It is estimated that there are currently 70,000 Australians living with Parkinson’s.The State-based Parkinson’s organisations provide a variety of services to people living with Parkinson’s, these include:·        Education for patients, clinicians and health care workers·        290 support groups nationwide for people living with Parkinson’s ·        Support through the 1800 info line·        Counselling services for people living with Parkinson’s and their carers·        Clinical support for people living with Parkinson’s through specialist nurses and allied health professionals·        Support for research including scholarship programs PREVIOUS SUCCESSFUL PROJECTSI have previously recorded 8 CD’s2015.

<p>My name is Chaz Samuel. I've played piano for almost 25 years as a hobby of mine. I am by no means a professional pianist. However, I've played violin for 7 and gained certifications from the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music when I was a child. I am a graduate of University of West Florida with a degree in Creative Writing and currently working on a novel but music is my passion. Since I was 13 years old I've wanted to make music for Nintendo. Specifically, I've wanted to make music for ""The Legend of Zelda"". I've studied the music over and over and listened to countless hours of soundtracks and fan creations. </p>
<p>This soundtrack's ultimate purpose was to provide catharsis for me. I've played through and have completed the latest entry in the series--""Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild"". Upon completion I realized how little of the main themes I heard in the game. Granted it was a stylistic choice I respected, but I longed for something more bombastic and orchestral. The few songs peppered throughout the game were among the best in the series but I needed more. I searched the internet and found various cover songs and re-orchestrations of the themes but felt that the only way I could fill this hunger for more music was to create my own.  </p>
<p>So I gathered all the necessary equipment and instruments I would need to make a re-score of Breath of the Wild's soundtrack but I realized quickly that a simple re-score would not be good. Using my creative writing background I sat down and analyzed the history of Hyrule and made a few notes regarding the events directly preceding ""Breath of the Wild"". The focus of the soundtrack changed from re-score to fan-made soundtrack.  </p>

<p>Let me start off by saying this, the soundtrack is <strong>complete</strong>. </p>
<p>So naturally the question is why ask for funding at all? Well in order to publish the soundtrack online to iTunes and Spotify and Amazon.com, I will need the necessary Mechanical Licenses for each song, a fact I did not realize until it was time to publish the soundtrack. I am asking for $1,500.00</p>
<p>The soundtrack is a 3 disc set with a total of 38 songs. A Mechanical License for each song will be handled through DestroKid. Their fee is $1.00 per song, per year billed annually. So in actuality it will be $12.00 per song and that comes out to about $456.00 just to release the soundtrack for which I will be handling the upkeep yearly.</p>
<p><strong><i>""Yes, but even with that...you're left with $944. Do you need that much?""</i></strong> The short answer is yes. My goal is also to provide physical copies of the soundtrack  as perks of backing the project. The total physical discs produced would be 300 for $820.00 through CDBaby.com. I would also commission actual artists to assist in making a 2 hour long youtube video telling the story and creating the website and promotional material. The cost breakdown is here:<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495916452/rveju342arwq0qsp1adm.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong><i>""But, wait! It shows a cost of $3,000 for instruments and samples. Are we paying that too?""</i> </strong>No. I've done 59% of the work, all I need is your help with the other 26%. If the project is funded beyond the $1,500.00 then we can talk about artists and all that. </p>
<p><strong><i>""So what do I get out of this and what do you get out of this?""</i></strong> Well for starters, since the soundtrack is complete and is ready to go for the most part, $2 gets you the entire soundtrack and $10 nets you a fancy physical copy. That's it. No fluff, no outlandish promises. As a thank you for backing the project you receive 38 songs for a $2 donation or a physical CD for $10. As to what I get out of it, well--I get the satisfaction that the songs are being heard by someone and out of legal trouble with Nintendo.</p>
<p>Regardless of the funding situation, the soundtrack will be available to all iTunes, Spotify, and Amazon.com users by the end of July. If by chance the project does not meet the goal, I will use the funds to offset the cost for the Mechanical Licenses and send out the physical CDs to backers who requested it. There may be a delay in shipment. </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What Have We Done So Far? </h3>
<hr style=""width:400px;color:firebrick;background-color:firebrick;height:3px;""/>
<p>We’ve spent the last months preparing the groundwork to organize the season of concert 2017/2018.</p>
<p>Firstly, we've met up with the jazz promoters to schedule gigs for a first leg between November 27th and December 15th 2017.</p>
<p>3 concerts have been booked in 2017, November 30th in France and Switzerland, December 2nd in Belgium. We have the possibilities to extend the tour in Germany, Poland, Denmark, Austria, Luxembourg and Estonia.</p>
<p>Secondly, we work actively to create our proper SVOD platform to make available our productions on any platform.  Our Jazz SVOD channel will be launched January 1st 2018.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why We Need Your Help With Funding</h3>
<hr style=""width:400px;color:firebrick;background-color:firebrick;height:3px;""/>
<p>First, we need your help to make these tours happen. A club remains the venue where the primary entertainment is the performance of jazz music and the first place for the audience to discover new talents. For bands, to perform in a club is the first opportunity to open doors to develop their art. As they are rather small compared to other music venues, it is very difficult for the artist and the venue to balance financially a gig especially when the venue is not located in a big city.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502811306/eyarmonmmlwwx9bmrreh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Secondly, we need your help to complete the budget to produce an audiovisual recording of these performances. To work in the best conditions and offer a quality level suited to your experience, we will have to rent a venue and recording devices then work with talented sound engineer and director.  </p>

<p>Voted one of the top 10 bassists of 2016 by the prestigious Downbeat Magazine Reader’s Poll, Mark Wade has been an active bassist in the NYC area for over 20 years.  In February 2015, Wade released his debut album Event Horizon to international acclaim.  The album received great critical reviews from a host of domestic and international publications such as Downbeat Magazine, Jazz In Europe, The New York City Jazz Record, All About Jazz, Jazz Life (Japan), and several others.<br/>Arnaldo DeSouteiro, founder of Jazz Station Records and NARAS-GRAMMY voting member, voted Event Horizon in the top 10 for his Best of 2015 in the categories of Best Acoustic Bass, Best Composer, and Best Instrumental Group, and #16 for Best Album of the Year. Event Horizon was played extensively on radio stations throughout the U.S. and Europe.</p>
<p>Currently, he plays with pianist and composer Takashi Asai, soprano Melinda Hughes, pianist Cecilia Coleman, trumpet player Bill Warfield.</p>

<p>With his outstanding technique and artistic expression, Lorenzo was immediately recognized by the media and began playing some of the most important musical venues in Europe very early. Specialized in jazz and contemporary music, Lorenzo has traveled back and forth from Europe to the United States, collaborating with important musicians such as J. Gregg, B. Dameo, T. Robinson, S. Kimmons, D. Freemann, G. Goldstein, C. Vilchez, S. Hunt, D. Martinez, T. Scott, T. Dambley, A. Acuna, E. Rodriguez, E. Marienthal, F. Gambale, M.Abrams, The Harlem Gospel Singers, J. Bisonette, F.

<p>""WE LIVE HERE, suite for jazz quartet"" is the first album of Lorenzo's acoustic quartet, and has been released by the Norwegian label Losen Records.

<p>CORPO presents new Jazz in the best meaning of the phrase.  The band, leaded by Mikael Godée, has been working as a group since 1992, and toured in Europe and went for a very successful tour to South-Africa in 1999. The South-African audiences did really appreciate CORPO, mix of Nordic melodies and African percussion.</p>
<p>Mikael Godée is one of the main ingredients of what we call Swedish jazz. His involvement with the Corpo and Änglaspel groups, where his lyrical and warm soprano saxophone creates a unique musical atmosphere, has been very important in today's jazz scene. ""<br/>This skilled and social musician who has covered numerous constellations with a pleasantly melodic atmosphere and great integrity has been rewarded with a Grammis (Swedish equivalent of the Grammy Awards) and a Jazz in Sweden Award.</p>
<p>”A lot consists only of a bright, shining surface. We are supposed to be impressed by the brilliance. But most often it lacks substantional context. Refreshing, then, to discover music with bone and marrow, as was the fact in Piteå, to have a chance to see a musical performance that didn’t need any ”show or glitter”, just music that lingers in the open minded listener’s head. Together the musicians create a music that penetrates the listener. The different tune characters change, of course, but are all inflicted with complex rhythms and meditative levels. All the band members are greatly skilled musicians, capable of conveying musical statements. Rich, intense, rhythmic and with humor. Music that stands alone. We want to hear more from CORPO!” – Lars-Erik Forsgren</p>

<hr style=""width:400px;color:firebrick;background-color:firebrick;height:3px;""/>
<p>BYP has been promoting and producing jazz music for nearly 10 years now and the booking model really hasn’t changed. Promoters of concerts (who may be the owners of clubs, labels and agencies or artists themselves) keep taking risk after risk, hoping for the best while artists roll the dice on the secondary and tertiary markets they are playing. With the reach that social media has and the popularity of crowdfunding we don’t need to take that risk and send artists out on the road wondering how shows will be.</p>
<hr style=""width:400px;color:firebrick;background-color:firebrick;height:3px;""/>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Other than contributing, how can I help?</strong></h3>
<hr style=""width:400px;color:firebrick;background-color:firebrick;height:3px;""/>
<p>Whether or not you’re in a position to make a financial pledge at the moment, we’d still really value your help in getting the message out about these bands, and this crowdfunding campaign.  You can do this by sharing this page via social media, or mentioning Badass Yogi Productions to friends who you know are interested in Jazz and music.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you so much for taking the time to read this. We all really appreciate it.</strong></p>

What Have We Done So Far? 

We’ve spent the last months preparing the groundwork to organize the season of concert 2017/2018.

Secondly, we work actively to create our proper SVOD platform to make available our productions on any platform.  Our Jazz SVOD channel will be launched January 1st 2018.
BYP.tv will feature exclusive content, full concerts, educational music programs and jazz documentaries.

First, we need your help to make these tours happen. A club remains the venue where the primary entertainment is the performance of jazz music and the first place for the audience to discover new talents. For bands, to perform in a club is the first opportunity to open doors to develop their art. As they are rather small compared to other music venues, it is very difficult for the artist and the venue to balance financially a gig especially when the venue is not located in a big city.

Secondly, we need your help to complete the budget to produce an audiovisual recording of these performances. To work in the best conditions and offer a quality level suited to your experience, we will have to rent a venue and recording devices then work with talented sound engineer and director.  

Artists On Tour


Mark Wade Trio - American Jazz

Voted one of the top 10 bassists of 2016 by the prestigious Downbeat Magazine Reader’s Poll, Mark Wade has been an active bassist in the NYC area for over 20 years.  In February 2015, Wade released his debut album Event Horizon to international acclaim.  The album received great critical reviews from a host of domestic and international publications such as Downbeat Magazine, Jazz In Europe, The New York City Jazz Record, All About Jazz, Jazz Life (Japan), and several others.Arnaldo DeSouteiro, founder of Jazz Station Records and NARAS-GRAMMY voting member, voted Event Horizon in the top 10 for his Best of 2015 in the categories of Best Acoustic Bass, Best Composer, and Best Instrumental Group, and #16 for Best Album of the Year. Event Horizon was played extensively on radio stations throughout the U.S. and Europe.
Currently, he plays with pianist and composer Takashi Asai, soprano Melinda Hughes, pianist Cecilia Coleman, trumpet player Bill Warfield.
Lorenzo De Finti Acoustic Quartet - Modern Jazz

With his outstanding technique and artistic expression, Lorenzo was immediately recognized by the media and began playing some of the most important musical venues in Europe very early. Specialized in jazz and contemporary music, Lorenzo has traveled back and forth from Europe to the United States, collaborating with important musicians such as J. Gregg, B. Dameo, T. Robinson, S. Kimmons, D. Freemann, G. Goldstein, C. Vilchez, S. Hunt, D. Martinez, T. Scott, T. Dambley, A. Acuna, E. Rodriguez, E. Marienthal, F. Gambale, M.Abrams, The Harlem Gospel Singers, J. Bisonette, F.

Lorenzo currently holds his own jazz and classical radio show on Rete Due Swiss national network in Lugano (Switzerland), interviewing many important musicians and musicologists and commenting on live concerts.
Mikael Godée's CORPO - New Jazz

CORPO presents new Jazz in the best meaning of the phrase.  The band, leaded by Mikael Godée, has been working as a group since 1992, and toured in Europe and went for a very successful tour to South-Africa in 1999. The South-African audiences did really appreciate CORPO, mix of Nordic melodies and African percussion.
Mikael Godée is one of the main ingredients of what we call Swedish jazz. His involvement with the Corpo and Änglaspel groups, where his lyrical and warm soprano saxophone creates a unique musical atmosphere, has been very important in today's jazz scene. ""This skilled and social musician who has covered numerous constellations with a pleasantly melodic atmosphere and great integrity has been rewarded with a Grammis (Swedish equivalent of the Grammy Awards) and a Jazz in Sweden Award.
”A lot consists only of a bright, shining surface. We are supposed to be impressed by the brilliance. But most often it lacks substantional context. Refreshing, then, to discover music with bone and marrow, as was the fact in Piteå, to have a chance to see a musical performance that didn’t need any ”show or glitter”, just music that lingers in the open minded listener’s head. Together the musicians create a music that penetrates the listener. The different tune characters change, of course, but are all inflicted with complex rhythms and meditative levels. All the band members are greatly skilled musicians, capable of conveying musical statements. Rich, intense, rhythmic and with humor. Music that stands alone. We want to hear more from CORPO!” – Lars-Erik Forsgren

Our Risks And Challenges

BYP has been promoting and producing jazz music for nearly 10 years now and the booking model really hasn’t changed. Promoters of concerts (who may be the owners of clubs, labels and agencies or artists themselves) keep taking risk after risk, hoping for the best while artists roll the dice on the secondary and tertiary markets they are playing. With the reach that social media has and the popularity of crowdfunding we don’t need to take that risk and send artists out on the road wondering how shows will be.

Other than contributing, how can I help?

Whether or not you’re in a position to make a financial pledge at the moment, we’d still really value your help in getting the message out about these bands, and this crowdfunding campaign.  You can do this by sharing this page via social media, or mentioning Badass Yogi Productions to friends who you know are interested in Jazz and music.
Thank you so much for taking the time to read this. We all really appreciate it.

<div>
<div><b>Who are you? </b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div> My name is Paul Bucur, I am 23 years old, I study international business at one of the best universities in Romania, in the heart of Transilvania, Cluj. In my free time I dance and teach dancing, after 10 years of gaining experience in this domain.</div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b> What do you really want to acomplish by this campaign?</b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div> The main goal is to show everyone that is possible. Ordinary people can organise such an event, without any help from other companies, agents or politicians that may lead the project and gain some benefits. I want a festival completely organised by people, for the people. I want anyone to afford to come to this kind of large-scale festival. I also want to show everyone that any income can go back to people, to charity organisations that really need help.</div>
<div><b> </b></div>
<div><b>How did you come out with this idea? </b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div> Recently in Cluj were organised two big festivals. Both of them huge. Biggest names in the domain, a big amount of people, but very high prices, even if they were organised with the support of the community or local leadership. Public money has been used and it was nothing different than a private festival. Sponsors that imposed certain brands, many restrictions and all income redirected to certain ""aknowledged people"". </div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b> What is so different about this festival?</b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div> Firstly, all income will be sent to charity organisations. Then, our main sponsors are the contributors themselves and in this way we won't be put in any situation to give any right to set the price of their products during the festival. In this way, when you're on a budget, this could be much smaller than any festival you've been at. Also, the basic price will be 20€/day for everyone.

Another inovative thing is the voting sistem for the costumization of the festival. Our contributors speak their minds and choose the landscape, the duration, the country and the artists.</div>
<div> Also, you'll be able to bring your own food and booze, not being restricted in any way! Be aware though: We'll still be having shops from where you can buy anything you like.</div>
<div><b> </b></div>
<div><b>Have you ever been involved in the organisation of a festival? </b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div>I never took part in the organisation of such a big festival, I was just volunteering before. I organised many other small events. </div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div>
<b> Did you get in touch with any charity organisations that you would like to support?</b> </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Yes. I hope that I will help them and I'm expecting the same thing from the other.<br/>
</div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>What will happen if you don't achieve the target sum of money?</b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div> This makes the most important question, because, as you can tell, it's a ""flexible-funding"" campaign, and this means that even if we don't get enough money, everything gained so far will not be returned. Well, I would like to assure you that absolutely no cent will be send to any other place, but to charity purposes. This is the only way, and if the people contributed with some money, it is my duty to give them back to people, but this time, to people that really need the money. </div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b> What's your part in this?</b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div> I came up with this idea, from scratch, thinking about all the people that would like to go to a large-scale festival, but can't afford it. Then, I decided that all the income should be given further, because I wanted to help more.
Personally, besides the time and energy that I put in this project, I already spent some money for website purposes, and I will also donate some. However, I hope that I will get a free ticket and not be left behind by the volunteers. </div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b> How many volunteers do you need?</b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div> Hmm.. as many as possible! The whole festival is based on the people's power, volunteer's power. Any thing that you could think of, concerning organising, requires a volunteer or more. 
So, we are desperately searching for volunteers that want to give us a hand and take part in something that will be a global inovation and I hope that this event will take part again, even if it's organised by me, even if other people will take my example and do the same thing where is needed. </div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>How can people that can't donate due to certain reasons help?</b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div>Any idea that could help us, or a person that has some kind of experience and would like to help is warmly welcomed to our website and asked to send us an email.
We also provide accomodation, food and free entries for every volunteer. We need help in all fields, from the building process, to web-designing or security.
Any help is welcomed!<br/>

Check the association website on www.bcrfcure.org


For the first time in history.
The internet takes over the world.
Just imagine:
Any country. Any artist. Any landscape. Any duration.
One single price: 20$ per day.
All the profit goes for charity!
Bring your own booze and food! 
Sounds interesting? 

The world of internet comes along together to create something that is going to be legendary forever. A brand new festival, on the largest scale, ""designed by the people, for the people"".
Hardwell, Armin Van Buuren, Martin Garrix, Tiesto, Avicii, David Guetta, Skrillex, Steve Aoki, Calvin Harris, Afrojack, Major Lazer, Wu Tang Clan, Zedd, Kaskade, Swedish House Mafia, Daft Punk, Fedde Le Grand, Carl Cox, Dash Berlin and more others, SKY IS THE LIMIT!
Our vision:
You are fed up with festivals organised by associations, companies, city councils or other people that have their own interest only. It's time for a new vision. All the profit goes for charity!
And here it is: THE BIGGEST FESTIVAL IN THE WORLD, COMPLETELY BY THE IDEAS AND THE OPINIONS OF THE CONTRIBUTORS !
100% donations, 100% internet, 100% you !
Our idea is to organise a festival that implies the smallest sum of money that can be possible used for a festival, but on the largest scale. Couldn't it be low-cost and good enough? We strongly believe it is possible! And yes, it is!You'll be able to bring your own food and booze, you won't be restricted in any way!  
All money goes for charity!
It is a ""flexible-funding"" campaign, so you will question what will happen with all the money if the target sum is not reached. 
Well, all the money will be donated to charity organisations. We are still searching because we want to help as many as we can, so any suggestion is welcomed. 
Perhaps you are involved in this kind of activity and you need some help.

The same thing will happen to any sum of money that will exceed our target. 
Any income cent will be sent towards charity purposes, after the closing of the festival. Feel free to contact us and share your knowledge at: charity@megafestival.org

Join in!

Do you want to feel the sand at the bottom of your feet? No problem!
Do you want Armin Van Buuren or maybe Afrojack? No problem!
Do you want to see Versailles from France or maybe Netherlands does fascinate you since your childhood? No problem!

You're on a large plateau, in the yard of a bavarian castle, on the top of a mountain. There you can see the Alpes through the horizon, also the air and the sun are caressing your face. The music is wonderful.
 In front of your eyes, you see the sunrise. The water splashes your knees. The sky is clear and blue. The sand is tickling your feet. Your lover is next to you. The music is marvelous.
 Far away, you'll see plenty of cars and impatient people. You just don't care. The lasers are giving their reflection over the nearby buildings, thousand of colorful lights make you jump simultaneously with the speakers. The music is astonishing.



What We Need
The expenses included in the budget are the following:
-volunteers fees (including accomodation, transport and so on)
- licences, organising fees.
- equipment and anything related to the technical part of organising (scene, decorations, proper camping areas, toilets, showers, and so on).
- fees that go to the artists (including accomodation, transport and other miscellaneous fees that may occur)
   
HOW DOES THE OPINION OF EACH CONTRIBUTOR MATTER:

Extra - For 100€ : A chart of the favourite artists. Each contributor will send an e-mail to the organisers who will line up weekly a chart of the favourite artists chosen. Any name sent will be taken into consideration. +Vote for Landscape, Duration and Country

FAQs and Press/Media


Who are you? 

 My name is Paul Bucur, I am 23 years old, I study international business at one of the best universities in Romania, in the heart of Transilvania, Cluj. In my free time I dance and teach dancing, after 10 years of gaining experience in this domain.

 What do you really want to acomplish by this campaign?

 The main goal is to show everyone that is possible. Ordinary people can organise such an event, without any help from other companies, agents or politicians that may lead the project and gain some benefits. I want a festival completely organised by people, for the people. I want anyone to afford to come to this kind of large-scale festival. I also want to show everyone that any income can go back to people, to charity organisations that really need help.
 
How did you come out with this idea? 

 Recently in Cluj were organised two big festivals. Both of them huge. Biggest names in the domain, a big amount of people, but very high prices, even if they were organised with the support of the community or local leadership. Public money has been used and it was nothing different than a private festival. Sponsors that imposed certain brands, many restrictions and all income redirected to certain ""aknowledged people"". 

 What is so different about this festival?

 Firstly, all income will be sent to charity organisations. Then, our main sponsors are the contributors themselves and in this way we won't be put in any situation to give any right to set the price of their products during the festival. In this way, when you're on a budget, this could be much smaller than any festival you've been at. Also, the basic price will be 20€/day for everyone.

Another inovative thing is the voting sistem for the costumization of the festival. Our contributors speak their minds and choose the landscape, the duration, the country and the artists.
 Also, you'll be able to bring your own food and booze, not being restricted in any way! Be aware though: We'll still be having shops from where you can buy anything you like.
 
Have you ever been involved in the organisation of a festival? 

I never took part in the organisation of such a big festival, I was just volunteering before. I organised many other small events. 


 Did you get in touch with any charity organisations that you would like to support? 

Yes. I hope that I will help them and I'm expecting the same thing from the other.


What will happen if you don't achieve the target sum of money?

 This makes the most important question, because, as you can tell, it's a ""flexible-funding"" campaign, and this means that even if we don't get enough money, everything gained so far will not be returned. Well, I would like to assure you that absolutely no cent will be send to any other place, but to charity purposes. This is the only way, and if the people contributed with some money, it is my duty to give them back to people, but this time, to people that really need the money. 

 What's your part in this?

 I came up with this idea, from scratch, thinking about all the people that would like to go to a large-scale festival, but can't afford it. Then, I decided that all the income should be given further, because I wanted to help more.
Personally, besides the time and energy that I put in this project, I already spent some money for website purposes, and I will also donate some. However, I hope that I will get a free ticket and not be left behind by the volunteers. 

 How many volunteers do you need?

 Hmm.. as many as possible! The whole festival is based on the people's power, volunteer's power. Any thing that you could think of, concerning organising, requires a volunteer or more. 
So, we are desperately searching for volunteers that want to give us a hand and take part in something that will be a global inovation and I hope that this event will take part again, even if it's organised by me, even if other people will take my example and do the same thing where is needed. 

How can people that can't donate due to certain reasons help?

Any idea that could help us, or a person that has some kind of experience and would like to help is warmly welcomed to our website and asked to send us an email.
We also provide accomodation, food and free entries for every volunteer. We need help in all fields, from the building process, to web-designing or security.
Any help is welcomed!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am asking for financial support for the beginning of a unique touring concert beginning in 2020. <strong>STATE OF BEING</strong> is a touring concert experience for Ultrasoprano and Electronics, a COMBINATION NEVER HEARD BEFORE, featuring commissions by composers from the United States, UK, Germany, and Norway. This music deals with themes of <i>looking within, illusion, distortion, the inner-most self, and the challenge of questioning what is real vs. what is imaginary</i>. The music follows the journey of one woman questioning and exploring her own reality, both within herself and through the stories of others. As a result, the audience is brought into<strong> a unique sound world and new reality, where they must also begin to question their own perspectives about life both in terms of what they see on the outside, and who they are internally.</strong></p>
<p>Those helping support this campaign allow me to get the proper equipment for the electronics, to pay the composers an introductory amount as a giant THANK YOU, and to help this incredible project get its feet off the ground!</p>
<p><strong>Who I am:</strong></p>
<p>International ""ultra-soprano"" (ultra-soprano"" (Second Inversion, WA, USA) and ""new music rising star"" (The Stranger, WA, USA), I aim to continuously pave the path of new and engaging music as a vocalist and performer. STATE OF BEING is not your traditional concert. Its subject and aesthetics are unique, daring and emotionally raw. The included works represent  every composer involved, all of whom I am so incredibly stunned by, and wish to share their work with the world.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>I am seeking funding for <strong>all electronics equipment</strong> (estimated at $1500) and <strong>the first payment to each of the composers</strong> for writing commissions for me. (I am asking for $1500 as well to be divided amongst the composers as a starter.)</li>
<li>If additional funds are raised they will go towards the <strong>production of new performances and/or performance related costs (travel to venue, etc.)</strong>.</li>
<li>Breakdown in detail:<ul>
<li>EQUIPMENT:<ul>
<li>Audio interface: ~€399</li>
<li>Headset Microphone + receiver: ~€1200</li>

The Impact

What makes STATE OF BEING special is that it combines the extraordinary voice of an Ultrasoprano with the intriguing world of electronic music – a combination never done in concert before in the world.
The program and the performance dive into the world of the human mind, conscious and unconscious.
It is planned that in the future STATE OF BEING could be staged.
STATE OF BEING  features only works by incredibly talented and prominent living composers from around the globe, and helps their magnificent work to prosper.
For me personally, STATE OF BEING is the largest solo touring project thus far.
My goal is for there to be versions of the concert that have an educational element. I would like to hold masterclasses for young composers and singers when this is performed at Universities. 


Risks & Challenges
This is not your typical opera concert. STATE OF BEING exceeds all expectations that come with this notion both aesthetically and conceptually. The challenges thus consist of:

Reaching a brand new audience and
possibly reaching the traditional opera audience.

This is the plan to master these challenges:

make an entirely unique experience that fills in a niche
possibly include transformed snippets of well-known classical repertoire

I'm looking to have a limited edition of 200 copies pressed, which will make it cheaper, because economics. If I had only 100 copies pressed, it would cost double. So we're not doing that. 200 copies. Yup.I'm using my local PEI record pressers Kaneshii, which do excellent work. And don't worry about that shortage you read about of lacquers - Canada has our own secret supply.Also a portion of the funding will be donated to the artist Prawny who created all the artwork.What you give is what you getVINYL:12"" blue coloured vinyl of the album in a nice colourful jacket sleeve, with postcards and stickers.CD-R:The emphasis is really on vinyl for this project, but you can also get a CD-R with full colour artwork, professionally pressed in a jewel case. Yes, this is a CDR (not a silver pressed CD) made by Kunaki and that's why the price is so low. Also includes postcards and stickers*VINYL + T-SHIRT COMBO:You get the 12"" blue colour vinyl, a special custom t-shirt in the colour and size of your choice, postcards, the stickers, and I'll throw in a CD-R for free!Both VINYL and CD-R pledges come with:- 2 postcards and 2 stickers- digital download of the album- my undying devotionIf the campaign is successful, the CDRs are shipped shortly after it closed but unfortunately, vinyl lovers will have to wait a minimum of 8-10 weeks after the end of the campaign before it goes into manufacturing and an additional week or so after it's mailed out. But good things come to those who wait! If there are any delays with the vinyl, I'll update you as I find out stuff.You can also just pledge the digital download if you wish, but all vinyl pledges come with a complimentary digital download in the format of your choice.THE BAD SHIPPING NEWS** PLEASE NOTE **What's more expensive than pressing vinyl? Shipping it!It's ridiculous, I won't lie. So there will be an additional shipping cost on top of your vinyl pledge.  I know, I'm sorry. But I went to the post office with a record and the prices are actual shipping.*For CDRs, Kunaki will ship anywhere in the world for a low price, so if you pledge for a CDR, it's $8 for everything: the CDR, shipping anywhere in the world and postcards and stickers - however since they are shipping the discs and not me, I will mail you the postcards and stickers separately...But what if I want more than one record? I ain't paying that much shipping! If you want to pledge for more than one copy of the vinyl (thank you!!), pledge once first and then send me a message using the ""ASK A QUESTION"" form at the top of this page and I will send you a secret link that will let you pledge for as many records as you want with a MUCH MUCH reduced shipping rate per record. RISKY RISK and the RISKYTONESThis project is an all or nothing deal. So if the goal is not reached, nothing is pressed and you are not charged anything. So no risk.Thanks for your interest and stay chill.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Space Funk has a limited supply of entertainment on their ship, a cobbled together space cruiser called The Profit. Among their derelict movies, they have found a cult classic called Star Odyssey. Space Funk has scored a new, hot original soundtrack for the film, which they intend to play live in synch with the screening. They have also marked up the video with tons of audience participation pop-ups for a spectator all-inclusive experience. Along with some new original songs, the soundtrack will debut in studio form on their album, 0-G Throwdown.</p>

Nothing better captures the heart than the sound of melancholic notes on a piano alongside the sweet scuffling of an upright bassist. Add a dream-like locomotion of drums and cymbals like sailing on a chariot in the clouds and you have the ingredients for a major work of art. With a song list inspired by such greats as Chet Baker, Russ Freeman and Bill Evans, this album is sure to win over the hearts of many.</p><p>    Nothing destroys the heart of music more than fake instruments. This album will not only be played on real ones but the best of the best. A grand piano, vintage drums and cymbals and of course the maturity and wisdom of an upright bass. But the instruments don't make the music. People do. My name is Jonathan Crocco. It is my wish to bring to you an album of jazz of the highest quality and musicianship possible. Yet one that won't try to seduce your ego with virtuosity and fire. One that won't try to intellectualize harmony and rhythm beyond the peacefulness of the moon and a gentle breeze. Above all, one that won't disregard your need for love and companionship after the day has been put aside, as life carries you well past the hour of midnight.</p><p>    After several rehearsals with the group spanning the later part of 2019, one of the members had to sacrifice his convenient availability for financial reasons. This is all too often the drama that occurs behind the curtain of a musician's life. This project needs your help. I have already invested hundreds of dollars in this album from buying the appropriate vintage cymbals to finding and rehearsing the appropriate musicians. I've also just got done professionally recording the ambient time of almost 20 vintage cymbals in an effort to better anticipate the most appropriate sound-locomotion behind the music of this project. Albums of this quality demand such seeds of consideration. This group has already performed at a business function and received a very pleasant return from the audience.</p><p>    The studio, Bop City where the album was destined to be recorded awaits the green light. We were ready to officially record from my own finances this past February(2020). Everything has suddenly stopped. Depending on my budget I'd also like to hire a known Parisian trumpet player as special guest to intersperse references of the heart warming character of Chet Baker. I feel his subtle melancholic style will add the final touch to this beautifully simple, mature listening experience. I'm also very pleased to inform you that one of my long time friends from college now living in Seattle will be contributing one of his beautiful songs on piano to this album.</p><p>    The details: I am of the generation that believes that good music starts with the right casting of musicians.

One full day of recording is all that is required. Most projects demanding this kind of quality span several days, some several months. In addition to this, because the musicians I selected are seasoned performers, mixing should take no more than a day. This is because good jazz musicians notoriously mix themselves as they play. However, any seasoned musician and engineer will tell you unforeseen problems always occur. One must always have a reserve of time for such cases. Funds for a second day of recording should be available.</p><p>    Mastering, as any seasoned engineer knows, is also very important. This allows for a professional quality sound across all platforms and entertainment systems. The higher quality mastering studios know how to give the overall experience a final shine, like the hot-wax cycle on a freshly cleaned car. This raises the album to a level coherent with the best of the best. That'll be the case for this album. The studio chosen ""has provided music for Grammy winning artists, The BBC, KBAQ &amp; KJZZ Radio, NAXOS Records, independent and signed artists, and various film scores.""</p><p>Check it out for yourself.

</h3><p>    This is not just another jazz album. If the fruit of this project is achieved it will be a work of humble, innocent beauty and companionship where the ego has been appropriately placed aside for the greater purpose, YOU. What better message to deliver the universe. This album will be a beacon in the dark to all that is priceless and closest to the whispers of the heart. Some members of this project have compared the sound achieved during rehearsals to some of the best sounding albums in jazz.</p><p>    I have never had the opportunity to pursue something of this nature. If you never try you'll never know. A few years ago a sound started to churn inside me. My work demands thousands upon thousands of hours listening and transcribing and performing music for my students. I have been doing this for almost two decades. After being immersed in so much music- dissecting it and explaining the workings of it to people for so long, I feel very confident in knowing what makes for a pleasant and worthy listening experience. Having said that, this album will surely appeal to lovers, parents, dreamers, lonely hearts, luxury brands and iconic cinematic moments. Though this album's true intention will undoubtedly appeal to the simplicity found in the coziness of any heart late into the night.</p><p>    The musicians have been chosen and enthusiastically desire to put this music into your history. The studios and engineers have been chosen for their reputable service of quality and professionalism. The music itself has been auditioned, chosen and arranged appropriately for the members of this album. The instruments themselves have been tested and chosen intentionally for the needs of this music. The distribution label has been chosen for its flawless service and relations with all the major streaming services in the world.

Rien ne saisit mieux le cœur que le son des notes mélancoliques sur un piano aux côtés de la douce bagarre d'un contrebassiste. Ajoutez une locomotive de tambours et de cymbales comme  un char dans les nuages et vous avez les ingrédients pour une œuvre d'art majeure. Avec une liste de chansons inspirées des grands noms comme Chet Baker, Russ Freeman et Bill Evans, cet album ne manquera pas de conquérir votre cœur.</p><p>    Rien ne détruit plus le cœur de la musique que de faux instruments. Cet album ne sera pas seulement joué sur de vrais instruments mais les meilleurs des meilleurs. Un piano à queue, des batteries et des cymbales vintages et bien sûr la maturité et la sagesse d'une contrebasse. Mais les instruments ne font pas la musique. Les gens font la musique. Je m'appelle Jonathan Crocco. C'est mon souhait de vous apporter un album de jazz de la plus haute qualité et musicalité possible. Pourtant, cet album n'essaiera pas de séduire votre ego avec virtuosité et feu. Il n'essaiera pas non plus d'intellectualiser l'harmonie et le rythme au-delà de la tranquillité de la lune et d'une douce brise. Surtout, cet album ne négligera pas votre besoin d'amour et de compagnie une fois la journée mise de côté au-delà de minuit.</p><p>     Après plusieurs répétitions avec le groupe pendant la dernière partie de 2019, l'un des membres a dû sacrifier sa disponibilité pour des raisons financières. C'est trop souvent le drame qui se déroule derrière le rideau de la vie d'un musicien. Ce projet a besoin de votre aide. J'ai déjà investi des centaines de dollars dans cet album, de l'achat des cymbales vintages appropriées à la recherche et à la répétition des musiciens adéquats. Je viens également d'enregistrer professionnellement le temps ambiant de près de 20 cymbales vintages dans le but de mieux anticiper la locomotion sonore la plus appropriée derrière la musique de ce projet. Les albums de cette qualité exigent de telles graines de considération. Ce groupe a déjà joué dans une fonction commerciale et a reçu un retour très agréable du public.</p><p>     Le studio Bop City où l'album était destiné à être enregistré attend le feu vert. Nous étions prêts à enregistrer officiellement avec mes propres finances en février (2020). Tout s'est soudainement arrêté. En fonction de mon budget, j'aimerais également engager un trompettiste parisien connu comme invité spécial pour entremêler les références du personnage réconfortant de Chet Baker. Je pense que son style mélancolique subtil ajoutera la touche finale à cette expérience d'écoute magnifiquement simple et mature. Je suis également très heureux de vous informer que l'un de mes amis de longue date de l'université vivant maintenant à Seattle contribuera à cet album d'une de ses belles chansons au piano.</p><p>  Les détails: je suis de la génération qui croit que la bonne musique commence par le bon casting des musiciens. Ce sont les musiciens les mieux adaptés que je connaisse à Paris. Ils ont foi en mon expérience et en mon jugement.</p><p>Franck Morin/Piano</p><p>Corentin Decouture/Bass</p><p>Special guest: Pascal Lacuès/Trumpet</p><p>Special guest: Tom Van Duzer/Piano</p><p>     Le studio est très important. L'ingénieur est très important. Il y en a plusieurs à Paris. Celui que j'ai choisi est très confortable, hors des sentiers battus et absent de tout sens de la célébrité et du faux caractère. Connu pour son ingénieur, il attire presque exclusivement l'artiste de jazz. De plus, c'est l'un des seuls studios à proposer un piano à queue maison au prix correct.</p><p>    Studio: Bop City, 9 Rue de Stalingrad Le Pré-Saint Gervais France 93310</p><p>    Max, l'ingénieur et propriétaire de Bop City, est un homme sympathique, soucieux de la musique mature et belle. Une journée complète d'enregistrement suffit. La plupart des projets exigeant ce type de qualité durent plusieurs jours, certains plusieurs mois. De plus, parce que les musiciens que j'ai sélectionnés sont des interprètes aguerris, le mixage ne devrait pas prendre plus d'une journée. C'est parce que les bons musiciens de jazz se ""mixent"" et s'adaptent  notamment  pendant qu'ils jouent. Cependant, tout musicien et ingénieur chevronné vous dira que des problèmes imprévus se produisent toujours. Il faut toujours avoir une réserve de temps pour de tels cas. Les fonds pour un deuxième jour d'enregistrement devraient être disponibles.</p><p>    Le ""Mastering"", comme tout ingénieur expérimenté  le sait, est également très important.  Cela permet un son de qualité professionnelle sur toutes les plates-formes et tous les systèmes de divertissement. Les studios de ""mastering"" de qualité supérieure savent comment donner à l'expérience globale un éclat final, comme l'étape de la cire chaude sur une voiture fraîchement nettoyée. Cela élève l'album à un niveau cohérent avec le meilleur des meilleurs. Ce sera le cas pour cet album. Le studio choisi ""a fourni de la musique à des artistes primés aux Grammy Awards, à la BBC, à la radio KBAQ &amp; KJZZ, à NAXOS Records, à des artistes indépendants et signés, et à diverses musiques de films.""</p><p>Vérifiez par vous-même.

Savoir que vous avez contribué à réunir les fonds nécessaires pour produire un si bel album dans une si belle ville est une récompense en soi. Cet album sera un message de votre part à tous pour l'amour, la paix, la beauté, la simplicité, la maturité, la camaraderie et la solidarité. Le monde le saura car votre contribution assurera également votre nom dans les notes linéaires.</p><h2>     <strong>L'impact</strong>
</h2><p>    Ce n'est pas juste un autre album de jazz. Si le fruit de ce projet est atteint, ce sera une œuvre d'une beauté et d'une camaraderie humbles et innocentes où l'ego a été correctement mis de côté pour le plus grand dessein, VOUS. Quel meilleur message pour délivrer l'univers. Cet album sera un phare dans le noir pour tout ce qui n'a pas de prix et se rapproche le plus des chuchotements du cœur. Certains membres de ce projet ont comparé le son obtenu pendant les répétitions à certains des meilleurs albums de jazz...</p><p>    Je n'ai jamais eu l'occasion de poursuivre quelque chose de cette nature. Si vous n'essayez jamais, vous ne saurez jamais. Il y a quelques années, un son a commencé à résonner en moi. Mon travail exige des milliers et des milliers d'heures d'écoute, de transcription et d'interprétation de musique pour mes élèves. Je fais cela depuis près de deux décennies. Après avoir été immergé dans tant de musique - en disséquant et en expliquant le fonctionnement aux gens pendant si longtemps, je me sens très confiant de savoir ce qui fait une expérience d'écoute agréable et digne. Cela dit, cet album plaira sûrement aux amoureux, aux parents, aux rêveurs, aux cœurs solitaires, aux marques de luxe et aux moments cinématographiques emblématiques. Bien que la véritable intention de cet album fasse sans aucun doute appel à la simplicité trouvée dans le confort de tout cœur jusque tard dans la nuit.</p><p>    Les musiciens ont été choisis et désirent avec enthousiasme mettre cette musique dans votre histoire. Les studios et ingénieurs ont été choisis pour leur service réputé de qualité et professionnel. La musique elle-même a été auditionnée, choisie et arrangée de manière appropriée pour les membres de cet album. Les instruments eux-mêmes ont été testés et choisis intentionnellement pour les besoins de cette musique.

Surtout, cet album ne négligera pas votre besoin d'amour et de compagnie une fois la journée mise de côté au-delà de minuit.     Après plusieurs répétitions avec le groupe pendant la dernière partie de 2019, l'un des membres a dû sacrifier sa disponibilité pour des raisons financières. C'est trop souvent le drame qui se déroule derrière le rideau de la vie d'un musicien. Ce projet a besoin de votre aide. J'ai déjà investi des centaines de dollars dans cet album, de l'achat des cymbales vintages appropriées à la recherche et à la répétition des musiciens adéquats. Je viens également d'enregistrer professionnellement le temps ambiant de près de 20 cymbales vintages dans le but de mieux anticiper la locomotion sonore la plus appropriée derrière la musique de ce projet. Les albums de cette qualité exigent de telles graines de considération. Ce groupe a déjà joué dans une fonction commerciale et a reçu un retour très agréable du public.     Le studio Bop City où l'album était destiné à être enregistré attend le feu vert. Nous étions prêts à enregistrer officiellement avec mes propres finances en février (2020). Tout s'est soudainement arrêté. En fonction de mon budget, j'aimerais également engager un trompettiste parisien connu comme invité spécial pour entremêler les références du personnage réconfortant de Chet Baker. Je pense que son style mélancolique subtil ajoutera la touche finale à cette expérience d'écoute magnifiquement simple et mature. Je suis également très heureux de vous informer que l'un de mes amis de longue date de l'université vivant maintenant à Seattle contribuera à cet album d'une de ses belles chansons au piano.  Les détails: je suis de la génération qui croit que la bonne musique commence par le bon casting des musiciens. Ce sont les musiciens les mieux adaptés que je connaisse à Paris. Ils ont foi en mon expérience et en mon jugement.Franck Morin/PianoCorentin Decouture/BassSpecial guest: Pascal Lacuès/TrumpetSpecial guest: Tom Van Duzer/Piano     Le studio est très important. L'ingénieur est très important. Il y en a plusieurs à Paris. Celui que j'ai choisi est très confortable, hors des sentiers battus et absent de tout sens de la célébrité et du faux caractère. Connu pour son ingénieur, il attire presque exclusivement l'artiste de jazz. De plus, c'est l'un des seuls studios à proposer un piano à queue maison au prix correct.    Studio: Bop City, 9 Rue de Stalingrad Le Pré-Saint Gervais France 93310    Max, l'ingénieur et propriétaire de Bop City, est un homme sympathique, soucieux de la musique mature et belle. Une journée complète d'enregistrement suffit. La plupart des projets exigeant ce type de qualité durent plusieurs jours, certains plusieurs mois. De plus, parce que les musiciens que j'ai sélectionnés sont des interprètes aguerris, le mixage ne devrait pas prendre plus d'une journée. C'est parce que les bons musiciens de jazz se ""mixent"" et s'adaptent  notamment  pendant qu'ils jouent. Cependant, tout musicien et ingénieur chevronné vous dira que des problèmes imprévus se produisent toujours. Il faut toujours avoir une réserve de temps pour de tels cas. Les fonds pour un deuxième jour d'enregistrement devraient être disponibles.    Le ""Mastering"", comme tout ingénieur expérimenté  le sait, est également très important.  Cela permet un son de qualité professionnelle sur toutes les plates-formes et tous les systèmes de divertissement. Les studios de ""mastering"" de qualité supérieure savent comment donner à l'expérience globale un éclat final, comme l'étape de la cire chaude sur une voiture fraîchement nettoyée. Cela élève l'album à un niveau cohérent avec le meilleur des meilleurs. Ce sera le cas pour cet album. Le studio choisi ""a fourni de la musique à des artistes primés aux Grammy Awards, à la BBC, à la radio KBAQ & KJZZ, à NAXOS Records, à des artistes indépendants et signés, et à diverses musiques de films.""Vérifiez par vous-même. Ils représentent la qualité et le professionnalisme à un prix correct.www.thebluedoorstudios.com     L'album une fois terminé sera distribué sur toutes les plateformes populaires, y compris Spotify, iTunes, Apple Music, Pandora, Amazon (permettant des copies de CD à la demande) Google Play, Tidal, iHeartRadio, Youtube, Deezer et plus de 150 autres magasins et services de streaming. Savoir que vous avez contribué à réunir les fonds nécessaires pour produire un si bel album dans une si belle ville est une récompense en soi. Cet album sera un message de votre part à tous pour l'amour, la paix, la beauté, la simplicité, la maturité, la camaraderie et la solidarité. Le monde le saura car votre contribution assurera également votre nom dans les notes linéaires.     L'impact
    Ce n'est pas juste un autre album de jazz. Si le fruit de ce projet est atteint, ce sera une œuvre d'une beauté et d'une camaraderie humbles et innocentes où l'ego a été correctement mis de côté pour le plus grand dessein, VOUS. Quel meilleur message pour délivrer l'univers. Cet album sera un phare dans le noir pour tout ce qui n'a pas de prix et se rapproche le plus des chuchotements du cœur. Certains membres de ce projet ont comparé le son obtenu pendant les répétitions à certains des meilleurs albums de jazz...    Je n'ai jamais eu l'occasion de poursuivre quelque chose de cette nature. Si vous n'essayez jamais, vous ne saurez jamais. Il y a quelques années, un son a commencé à résonner en moi. Mon travail exige des milliers et des milliers d'heures d'écoute, de transcription et d'interprétation de musique pour mes élèves. Je fais cela depuis près de deux décennies. Après avoir été immergé dans tant de musique - en disséquant et en expliquant le fonctionnement aux gens pendant si longtemps, je me sens très confiant de savoir ce qui fait une expérience d'écoute agréable et digne. Cela dit, cet album plaira sûrement aux amoureux, aux parents, aux rêveurs, aux cœurs solitaires, aux marques de luxe et aux moments cinématographiques emblématiques. Bien que la véritable intention de cet album fasse sans aucun doute appel à la simplicité trouvée dans le confort de tout cœur jusque tard dans la nuit.    Les musiciens ont été choisis et désirent avec enthousiasme mettre cette musique dans votre histoire. Les studios et ingénieurs ont été choisis pour leur service réputé de qualité et professionnel. La musique elle-même a été auditionnée, choisie et arrangée de manière appropriée pour les membres de cet album. Les instruments eux-mêmes ont été testés et choisis intentionnellement pour les besoins de cette musique. Le label de distribution a été choisi pour son service irréprochable et ses relations avec tous les principaux services de streaming dans le monde. Et maintenant, vous avez été choisi pour vos propres valeurs d'amour et de camaraderie.Veuillez utiliser les outils de partage indiegogo pour faire passer le mot.Je vous remercie.Musicalement vôtre,Jonathan Crocco",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>...we have been struggling to raise enough money to keep him from being evicted at the end of the month.</strong></h3>
<p>Like many people in the past year, a close friend of mine was impacted heavily by the COVID-19 pandemic. I'm a film composer/producer and he's a fantastic drummer, so our first instinct was to play to our strengths to create something awesome to offer to people in exchange for their help. The problem is: we have less than two weeks to pull this off.</p>
<h3>His Story</h3>
<p>Already living paycheck to pay check, there was little margin of error when the pandemic hit the US. As a chronic sufferer of allergies, he found himself being sent home at his employer's whim, or at the slightest sneeze. Soon he also contracted the virus after exposure at his workplace, and was unable to work for an additional 3 weeks. <strong>After missing a total of 5 weeks of work, he found himself caught in an ever-growing snowball of fees and bills that made it impossible for him to get out on top.</strong></p>
<p>Over the last few weeks, we have been struggling to raise enough money to keep him from being evicted at the end of the month. This is why we created the OP Drum library.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What you'll get</h3>
<p>The OP Drum library is a collection of drum grooves, loops and fills that you can use in your personal music projects. You'll have a number of different styles and tempos to choose from in order to take your track to the next level, including classic rock, metal and country beats and fills. Everything was recorded live at SoundCast Studios in Winnetka, California, with state of the art equipment, and produced by industry professionals. Each successive perk contains even more of the original files and recordings used to create the library, for maximum control over your mix.</p>
<h3>We're so close!</h3>
<p>Through the efforts of another close friend, we were able to raise half of the amount needed to keep him housed! Now we just need the final push!</p>
<p>If you've read this far, thank you so much for your interest, and please share this with anyone who might be interested in our library and in supporting a fantastic and hard working musician!</p>

<p>~ NEW ALBUM ~</p>
<p>The new Vivaldi Metal Project album will not only feature classical masterworks by Vivaldi, but the works of other great composers such as Chopin, Mozart, Bach, Fauré, Schubert, Saint-Saens, Dvorak, Beethoven, Albinoni, Paganini, and more.</p>
<p>While based on classical themes, these songs will be largely composed of original material, representative of Vivaldi Metal Project’s symphonic-metal style.</p>
<p>As on the band’s previous album ""The Four Seasons"", all songs will include vocalists, band, orchestra and choir, as well as a featured cast of internationally-recognized metal and classical artists.</p>
<p>CONCEPT</p>
<p>The band's first record revolved around the concept of the various ""seasons"" of the human life - from birth to death. As a continuation of the last, this new album will explore the ""seasons"" of our emotional experience as human beings - from joys to sorrows and from frailty to deep strength. Each song creates a rich musical tapestry expressing the “colours” of raw human emotion, while weaving a common thread throughout the album.</p>
<p>~ OVERVIEW ~</p>
<p>The Vivaldi Metal Project is a symphonic-metal group conceived and produced by Italian keyboard player, composer and producer Mistheria</p>
<p>(solo artist, Bruce Dickinson, RoyZ, Rob Rock, Mark Boals, Artlantica, Tower of Babel)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Back in 2013, Mistheria started thinking about making a metal version of “The Four Seasons”, a masterpiece that he loved and kept listening to since his childhood. Mistheria started to play and record all the movements on the piano but then felt that a parallel symphonic-metal version would have been the perfect continuation.</p>
<p>Mistheria made the “innovative” choice – never done so far – to add lyrics and singers to “The Four Seasons” which, as composed by Vivaldi, is an instrumental work. For this important task, he invited Douglas R. Docker who perfectly translated the producer’s concept into brilliant lyrics. Additional lyrics were written by Mistheria, Rob Rock and Lance King.</p>
<p>A cast of 10 awesome arrangers joined Mistheria creating epic and memorable music, combining a standard metal band lineup with strings, orchestra and choir:<br/>Douglas R. Docker, Francesco Dall’O’, Frank Caruso, Gabriels, Keiko Kumagai, Nicolas Waldo, Pawel Penksa, Tomas Varnagiris, Yannis Androulakakis, Zhivko Koev.</p>
<p>The cast furthermore includes performances by Mark Boals (Malmsteen, Royal Hunt), Fabio Lione (Rhapsody of Fire, Angra), Edu Falaschi (Almah), Rob Rock (Impellitteri), Mike Lepond (SymhonyX), Dani Löble (Helloween), Ruud Jolie (Within Temptation), Mark Cross (Firewind, Scorpions), Steve Di Giorgio (Testament), Rolf Pilve (Stratovarius), Victor Smolski (Rage, Almanac), Ruben Israel (Delain), John Macaluso (ARK), Marco Sfogli (James Labrie), Chris Caffery (Savatage), Mark Wood (Trans Siberian Orchestra), Dirk Verbeuren (Soilwork), Atma Anur (Tony MacAlpine), Vitalij Kuprij, Anna Portalupi (Tarja Turunen), Sean Tibbetts (Kamelot), Martijn Peters (Stream of Passion) and many more.</p>
<p>Moreover, the project features the “Sinfonietta Consonus Symphonic Orchestra” (Poland), the “Academic Choir Angel Manolov” (Bulgaria), the “Chamber Choir Ivan Filipovic” (Croatia) and the “Rock Academy Choir” (Croatia). It took more than 2 years of intensive non-stop hard work to complete the album.</p>

<p>Short version: we want your money. We’re also accepting satchels of gold nuggets, unwanted Bentleys, and mouthfuls of precious gems stolen from booby-trapped pirate ships.</p>
<p>Long version: Kangaralien’s recording efforts to this point have been modest in scope. For the most part we set up two mics in Eric’s basement, gaze adoringly into each other’s eyes, and try to get through a take without butchering it. We’re ready to try something new.</p>
<p>We’d like to “do it right” this time. Some of the process, namely the adoring gazes, will remain. But we’re expanding to full-band arrangements featuring some semi-recognizable names. Depending on how much cash we can drum up, we’ve been in talks with drummer Gavin Harrison (Porcupine Tree, Iggy Pop, King Crimson), bassist Tony Levin (Peter Gabriel, Liquid Tension Experiment, Paul Simon), and some other celebrity-type peoples. Was that enough name-dropping? Cool.</p>
<p>Some of these musicians we don’t know personally, so we’d need to pay them actual wages. And even our buddies like Max Zemanovic (Miranda Lambert, Andrew Duhon) should probably get paid I guess. Aside from paying musicians, once we add acoustic drums and dozens of overdubs into the fold, we may decide to hire a mix engineer. Beyond that we need to pay for studio time for live drums, mastering, artwork, graphic design, photography, duplication, and one gross of Shamwows. Eric is clumsy and he’s planning to spill stuff everywhere.</p>
<p>One of the reasons crowd-funding is useful is that it helps us gauge interest. How many vinyl copies should we press? Zero? Do people still buy CDs? Where do ponies go when they die?</p>
<p>So- what do you get in return for your contribution? Check out our list of incentives. The main prize, of course, is that I, Steve, will give you the “what’s up” nod when we see each other in public. You can’t put a price on that. But it’s $125. Also, give any amount and you're entitled to updates on our album. You’ll see videos of what we’re up to, videos of me riding my bike, maybe a super non-informative guitar instructional video, and definitely a makeup tutorial.</p>
<p>We literally can’t do this without you. Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi. You’re my only hope.</p>

<p>My name is Nice Brazil. I'm singer, composer and producer from São Paulo, Brazil. I love the Brazilian music, especially the Brazilian Jazz. I already produced 4 Albums - 3 Independents in my 15-years career as a professional musician. The album JaZZ Popular Brasileiro is my new project and will be presented on tour with a great Band in March 2018. During the Tour the Album will be recorded. I hope you will come on board to help make it happen!</p>
<p>My passion for music began in my childhood in São Paulo, my hometown. With the music of the Radio and major festivals. With the protest and revolt against the military dictatorship, present in the poetry of composers such as Chico Buarque, Geraldo Vandré and Joao Bosco. With MPB (Brazilian Popular Music), with Bossa Nova. And last but not least the great interpreters of Brazilian music, Jazz and Pop music.</p>
<p>Later, my experience as an actress in theater and musicals for kids would further reinforce my desire to deepen myself in the creative work of vocal expression. At that time the fascination for music and theater led me to an interest in different musical styles and their interpretations. This interest and fascination with music are still omnipresent.</p>
<p>It's a pleasure to express myself through music and have the prestige to share that passion not only with my musicians, but also with you,  fan of the Brazilian music.</p>
<p>With the new album JaZZ Popular Brasileiro I'll celebrate my musical roots and honor my ancestors.</p>
<p>The project will be realized with the support of amazing musicians: the Brazilian drumming legend <strong>Portinho (BR/USA)</strong>, the great pianist and producer <strong>Klaus Mueller (G/USA)</strong> and the grant bass player <strong>Dudu Penz (BR/CH).</strong></p>

</div><div>
<p>As you know if you’ve been watching my career in the last fifteen years, I sing, compose, manage and produce my own projects by myself.  I have also organized some concerts in Germany. I'm lucky to have real friends and great musicians by my side. My persistent musical work, my experience and musical insight, led me to successfully produce and record my independent albums:<br/>Meu Caminho (My Way), Arcobaleno (Rainbow), Pra Voce (For You) and Minhas Raízes (My Roots).</p>
<p>The CD Arcobaleno at JazzMagazin, JazzThing:</p>

<p>The CD Pra Voce won an honorable mention on the list of the best Brazilian music in 2014</p>

<p>Since many years I've been singing with my band at many jazz clubs and several jazz festivals in Europe.</p>
<p>My repertoire consists of  compositions of the 60s and 70s only - and my own compositions.</p>
<h3>About the new Project  ""JaZZ Popular Brasileiro"":</h3>
<p>With this project, I want to reveal the parallels and discrepancies between Jazz and MPB (Brazilian Popular Music).<br/>The basic idea is to reduce as far as possible the musical distance to jazz and to reveal all the jazz affinities in our popular music.<br/>Opposing sounds, rhythms, poetry and a diverse mix of different Brazilian musical styles like Bossa-Nova, Samba, Choro, Baiao etc. are being offered.<br/>In this way, already known compositions are interpreted in a new way and esteemed from another perspective.<br/>In addition, the compositions themselves tell stories that invite you to reflect, feel and dream. The fusion of different styles of music lends the diversity of life a voice - the voice of jazz.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your contribution to the realization of this project !</p>

Any money that is raised beyond my campaign goal will be put towards the album record budget, and increased online advertising and distribution. Other Ways You Can HelpSpread the word ! The Difference You Make

As you know if you’ve been watching my career in the last fifteen years, I sing, compose, manage and produce my own projects by myself.  I have also organized some concerts in Germany. I'm lucky to have real friends and great musicians by my side. My persistent musical work, my experience and musical insight, led me to successfully produce and record my independent albums:Meu Caminho (My Way), Arcobaleno (Rainbow), Pra Voce (For You) and Minhas Raízes (My Roots).
The CD Arcobaleno at JazzMagazin, JazzThing:
https://www.jazzthing.de/review/arcobaleno-bossa-nova-more/
The CD Pra Voce won an honorable mention on the list of the best Brazilian music in 2014
http://www.melhoresdamusicabrasileira.com.br/2014/12/2014-amostra-completa.html
Since many years I've been singing with my band at many jazz clubs and several jazz festivals in Europe.
My repertoire consists of  compositions of the 60s and 70s only - and my own compositions.
About the new Project  ""JaZZ Popular Brasileiro"":
With this project, I want to reveal the parallels and discrepancies between Jazz and MPB (Brazilian Popular Music).The basic idea is to reduce as far as possible the musical distance to jazz and to reveal all the jazz affinities in our popular music.Opposing sounds, rhythms, poetry and a diverse mix of different Brazilian musical styles like Bossa-Nova, Samba, Choro, Baiao etc. are being offered.In this way, already known compositions are interpreted in a new way and esteemed from another perspective.In addition, the compositions themselves tell stories that invite you to reflect, feel and dream. The fusion of different styles of music lends the diversity of life a voice - the voice of jazz.
Thank you very much for your contribution to the realization of this project !

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, world! We are Foray Between Ocean (F.B.O.), five dudes based in Athens Greece (Jon, Themis, Kostas, Elias and Stefanos) who make sweet horror lullabies for your children's nightmares. Over the past two years we have released our 1st album ""Depression neverending"" .We've toured our country and played to some awesome venues, also supporting some notable acts like Annihilator, Belfegor etc. But now the time has come. Τhe time to write more horror stories, more sweet death/black metal tunes, for teachers to teach and preachers to preach. We've already began to write our beautiful hellish music, in order to take advantage of this incredible opportunity, we need some help!</p>
<p><strong>Without you, it would be MUCH more difficult, delayed, and stressful to share the power of positive actions and perseverance through the music we create as Foray Between Ocean.</strong></p>
<p>We live the music everyday. We hope that the notes and the words convey the strong feelings and emotions that inspired them. Each song built upon real life human experiences. We take inspiration from each other, from our fans, from our communities, and this world we share.</p>

<h3> The idea:</h3>
<p>""Antilles, before the islands: our black blood. Antilles, a fusion of cultures, of peoples who, faced with kidnapping and plunder, responded with chants for freedom. The Antillean Confederation was an ideology of those who, like Ramón Emeterio Betances, saw in our islands the emergence of a new idiosyncrasy: the Caribbean spirit. Betances, the Antillean, by choice he knew our sea, he lived in many of our islands and fought for the freedom of our peoples. Faced with the threat of empires, either from the north or from the west, he proclaimed: the Antilles for the Antilleans. From that statement emerges the memory of our common stories, because we are islands bathed by the same sea, the same blood flows, the same joys and the same pain. We speak in Spanish, French, Creole, English. We are Fusion, flavors, colors and rhythms. And from our diversity the Antillean calls to beat in syncopated beats.""</p>Our idea for the CD is born from the statement above.  I have been playing since I was a teenager and after many years I have noticed that we as people have more things in common than differences.  This recording is a celebration of that and what it means in this moment to the islands of the Caribbean.<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>The budget for the recording is about $15,000.  We can complete $2,000 with our savings as a band. So we need about $13,000 to complete what is needed to pay the studio recording, mixing, mastering, studio engineers, CD manufacturing, Art, etc.</li>
<li>As a perk for supporting our campaign we offer downloads, physical CD's and Fusion Beat T-Shirts</li>
<li>Please help us reach this goal by purchasing your CD in advance and claim one of our rewards.  Thank you !</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>This project emphasize the things that we have in common as people.</li>
<li>We have been developing master classes on our music for beginners, intermediate and advanced levels. </li>
<li>We can use the recording to improve the pedagogical quality of our instruction delivery</li>
<li>The community is always benefited by good and diverse music. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>The challenge is to record a 6 piece jazz group all at the same time.  Also to do all the pre-production, production and post-production on time.</li>
<li>However the musician's proficiency and the quality of our arrangers and composers will help us to overcome this challenge.</li>
<li>As a band we all have been involved successfully before in the production of recordings.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot contribute at this time, please help us to spread the word with social media.  You can use the Facebook, Twitter and Copy Link icons on IndieGoGo to spread the word. Thank you!</p>

The budget for the recording is about $15,000.  We can complete $2,000 with our savings as a band. So we need about $13,000 to complete what is needed to pay the studio recording, mixing, mastering, studio engineers, CD manufacturing, Art, etc.
As a perk for supporting our campaign we offer downloads, physical CD's and Fusion Beat T-Shirts
Please help us reach this goal by purchasing your CD in advance and claim one of our rewards.  Thank you !


The Impact

This project emphasize the things that we have in common as people.
We have been developing master classes on our music for beginners, intermediate and advanced levels. 
We can use the recording to improve the pedagogical quality of our instruction delivery
The community is always benefited by good and diverse music. 


Risks & Challenges

The challenge is to record a 6 piece jazz group all at the same time.  Also to do all the pre-production, production and post-production on time.
However the musician's proficiency and the quality of our arrangers and composers will help us to overcome this challenge.
As a band we all have been involved successfully before in the production of recordings.

The style is formed around an ego-rap base, as the 'game' imposes, with doses of fun, cultural references.  </p><p>Album cover explained: It contains 4 major elements. The first one is the green-shaded background in order to show respect for the best artist in the present Kendrick Lamar.The second element is the ""Seven Society"" emblem. After my research, I think they are the undercover heroes of our world. I have no real connections to them, and I don't want them to find this use disrespectful. The third element is the old Parental Advisory logo. I found it funny (ha) because It will remind me of my group 10Tone. (Tone of this record, unsuitable for minors). Oh, and it will be just for the design of the album cover, because I'm not intending to use any foul, explicit language in any of my songs. The last element, is the font that I've used in order to type my name and Reynasterea. Its called DacianDonarium, because of my dacian roots. </p><p>This album WILL drop on 7 August.  A sample of the sound that I'm going to use can be heard here: 7AMOLXE Original Cut: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmGmLdpyIIE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://youtu.be/Frj7R_q5H2s</a></p><p>What will I do with the raised-money? I got to invest in recording this album. It is written, 7 tracks but I want to use the highest sound-recording devices in order to complete and succeed.

The style is formed around an ego-rap base, as the 'game' imposes, with doses of fun, cultural references.  Album cover explained: It contains 4 major elements. The first one is the green-shaded background in order to show respect for the best artist in the present Kendrick Lamar.The second element is the ""Seven Society"" emblem. After my research, I think they are the undercover heroes of our world. I have no real connections to them, and I don't want them to find this use disrespectful. The third element is the old Parental Advisory logo. I found it funny (ha) because It will remind me of my group 10Tone. (Tone of this record, unsuitable for minors). Oh, and it will be just for the design of the album cover, because I'm not intending to use any foul, explicit language in any of my songs. The last element, is the font that I've used in order to type my name and Reynasterea. Its called DacianDonarium, because of my dacian roots. This album WILL drop on 7 August.  A sample of the sound that I'm going to use can be heard here: 7AMOLXE Original Cut: https://youtu.be/Frj7R_q5H2sWhat will I do with the raised-money? I got to invest in recording this album. It is written, 7 tracks but I want to use the highest sound-recording devices in order to complete and succeed. I will also pay photographers, PR-s, camera-mans, editors and for the multiplying the CD in the best physical form.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Why, hello there! :-)<br/>My name is Naida Lynn and I am a Haitian-American, singer/songwriter based in South Florida! </p>
<p>You ever come to a place where you're tired of letting fear of failure or rejection run your life? Tired of hiding who you are and ready to just get real already?--embracing your identity &amp; every God-given dream with confidence? Well that's my story and there's a soundtrack for that now! ha</p>
<p>In my most compelling work yet, I tackle subjects like letting go of toxic relationships, reconnecting with my Haitian roots, and the process of finally believing that my truest self is good enough. In this project, I sing the tune that every heart cries but need YOUR help to get this music out there. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So far, I have paid all the front-end costs to record 6 of the 7 songs that will be on this EP but now need an additional $4,000 to pay for the remainder of production (ie, mixing &amp; mastering), as well as funds for digital distribution, album printing, marketing and promotions.<br/><br/>More specifically:<br/>---Record final song - $500<br/>---Mixing &amp; Mastering - $2000 <br/>---Digital Distribution - $100 <br/>---Album Printing - $500 <br/>---Marketing &amp; promotions - $900 (ie, merch, online marketing, touring, etc.) <br/><br/>My deadline to raise this by is October 31st. <br/><br/>IN RETURN FOR DONATING TO THIS PROJECT, I am pleased to offer various insider perks including exclusive music releases, signed merchandise, a song written in your honor &amp; more!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I have definitely gone out on a limb with this one--essentially putting all of my eggs into this one basket! Why? Because I believe in the message and believe that my story will help people everywhere to rise again after hitting rock bottom. What began as a way for me to wear my heart on my vocal chords is not the tale of a powerful journey from struggle to peaceful self-discovery. </p>
<p>My greatest risk here would be getting to this point (recording all of these lovely songs) but not being able to afford to polish them &amp; get them out to the world! But this is where you come in and can help make this dream a reality! <br/><br/>Between 2 fundraising concerts I'm planning as well as the support of friends &amp; family, I believe that I will reach my goal and impact tons of people. Would you consider donating today? </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you've read down this far but aren't able to contribute financially, don't be discouraged! You can STILL help out &amp; here's how: <br/><br/>#1: Get the word out!! Share this page and hashtag #TeamRoyaLynn so we can keep track. <br/>#2: Pray for me! Pray that all the needed funds come through and that this music makes a difference for people everywhere. <br/>#3: Finally, once my music, lyric videos and music videos come out, please share!! </p>Thanks again for who you are and for your willingness to follow my journey!

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>My name is Febian Perez, and I'm the songwriter/frontman for Eclisse, a darker/heavier band based in Portland. Eclisse is influenced by such bands as: Deftones, Queens of the Stone Age, King Crimson, Sigur Ros, Radiohead, Mastodon and more...I spent a good part of last year writing and recording my first album ""The Origin of Error"", and I loved the process. The feeling of making something out of nothing is addictive, and I feel like my work ethic and creative skill-set has grown tenfold since the recording of our first album. I'm beyond excited to go back into the studio, with 8 new amazing songs and truly make something that will stand the test of time. By contributing to this project, you'll help me manifest the music in my head into an album which will ideally introduce my music into bigger markets.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need $3,500 to fund this record. 11 days of studio time will run me about $3,000. Mastering will cost me about $250 and CD duplication will be about the same. The unique perks are super rad, from limited edition Vinyls of our first record and our upcoming second record, to custom songs written just for you and even potentially a private show in your home town!!</p>
<p>If the goal is not reached, all funds will go directly into studio costs.</p>
<p>To get an idea of the quality of work I bring to the table, please listen to these two songs from our first album!</p>

<p>I make it my utmost priority, when in the studio, to complete the project at hand and give it my 100%. I spend many weeks doing pre-production, working on the songs and recording demos and constantly perfecting them before bringing it to the studio. This new album is heading into a much heavier direction, but staying very melodic and dynamic. I've been listening to a lot of different music to get my brain into gear... I'm pulling creative inspiration from many sources and I feel like this album is going to be a killer both musically and conceptually.</p>
<p>I'm recording this album with Jordan Richter, a talented Engineer who owns and operates Room 13 Recording Studios in Portland, OR. Jordan and I worked together on the first album, and have amazing creative chemistry together! Mastering will be done by Adam Gonsalves of Telegraph Mastering. Duplication will be done by Saturn CD Duplication.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest risk is potential delay with Vinyl productions, as most plants take months to turn around orders. I will to my best to maximize turn arounds by working with smaller plants if need be. The album itself is on a strict timeline, so there should be no delay in getting that recorded/mixed and mastered before the deadline.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">The Batmetal LIVE tour has been postponed. Don’t worry though! - everybody who backed is being refunded 100% of their pledge. Your funds will appear in your account within 5 working days.<br/><br/>Thankyou so much to everyone who showed their support and to all our backers. Without you there is no Batmetal!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What do I have to do to get my money back?</strong><br/>You don’t have to do anything! We have issued refunds for all backers (Including those who donated!) You should see the funds back in your account within 5 working days.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What happened!?</strong><br/>We would like to thank everyone who backed us and showed their support! You are all awesome! The sad truth is we didn’t raise enough to put on any of the live shows this time.<br/><br/><strong>Will you consider trying again in the future?</strong><br/>Yes!  We are looking at how we can make a potential future Batmetal LIVE campaign a success. This has certainly been a learning experience for us, and there are definitely things we can do better next time.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Here are some of the things we would do different:<br/>1. Start smaller. One show in one country + plus a livestream for our fans worldwide.<br/>2. More exclusive perks (Back stage tours, dinner with the creators etc…)<br/>3. More financial transparency</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Does this affect Batmetal?</strong><br/>Nope! The Youtube series will go on as normal :)</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What happens if I canceled the credit card I used to make my original contribution? How will I get my refund?</strong><br/>Your refunded contribution will still get sent back to your original credit card's issuing bank without issue.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">FAQ</h2>
<p><strong>What venues!?</strong><br/>Venues and travel information will be announced Mid May. We won't know exactly what venue to book until we know how many people are interested - which is why it is important to pledge your interest asap! <strong>All venues will be within a 10 mile radius of each city, with excellent transport links.</strong><br/><br/><strong>I don't understand! Why should I pledge without knowing the venue?</strong><br/>When you pledge you are letting us know you are interested and you can travel to the city. If 500 people pledge for a particular city - we can book a venue that holds 500. If 2000 people pledge, we can book somewhere bigger. Waiting to pledge until after we've announced venues is bad as it makes the numbers look smaller, <strong>thus the venue will be smaller, meaning we cannot guarantee your place!<br/><br/>What if you announce a venue and I no like it!?</strong><br/>No problem! We will happily refund your pledge(s)  - using indiegogo means there is no risk to you.<br/><br/><strong>What if the show doesn't happen?</strong><br/>It's indiegogo - so you get 100% of your money back.</p>

<p><strong>What kind of tickets are these?</strong><br/>Standing only.</p>

<p><strong>Can I take photos of the show?</strong><br/>Yes, but no flash please</p>
<p><strong>Does the show use special FX?</strong><br/>Yes. Batmetal LIVE uses a variety of stage FX. Including STROBE and PYROTECHNICS.</p>
<p><strong>How does it work?</strong><br/>BATMETAL LIVE uses top secret Wayne Enterprises holographic technology to bring the characters to life.<br/><br/><strong>Is there disabled access?</strong><br/>Disabled access is available at all Batmetal LIVE Performances.</p>

</div></div>","The Batmetal LIVE tour has been postponed. Don’t worry though! - everybody who backed is being refunded 100% of their pledge. Your funds will appear in your account within 5 working days.Thankyou so much to everyone who showed their support and to all our backers. Without you there is no Batmetal!
What do I have to do to get my money back?You don’t have to do anything! We have issued refunds for all backers (Including those who donated!) You should see the funds back in your account within 5 working days.
What happened!?We would like to thank everyone who backed us and showed their support! You are all awesome! The sad truth is we didn’t raise enough to put on any of the live shows this time.Will you consider trying again in the future?Yes!  We are looking at how we can make a potential future Batmetal LIVE campaign a success. This has certainly been a learning experience for us, and there are definitely things we can do better next time.
Here are some of the things we would do different:1. Start smaller. One show in one country + plus a livestream for our fans worldwide.2. More exclusive perks (Back stage tours, dinner with the creators etc…)3. More financial transparency
Does this affect Batmetal?Nope! The Youtube series will go on as normal :)
What happens if I canceled the credit card I used to make my original contribution? How will I get my refund?Your refunded contribution will still get sent back to your original credit card's issuing bank without issue. The issuing bank will determine how to get the funds to you:
If there is a balance owed on the card, it offsets the balance. If you opened up a different card, the issuer usually transfers the credit to the new account. Sometimes the issuer will cut a check to the customer. Regardless of which way the issuing bank handles this, the card issuer will handle reimbursing the backer. We recommend reaching out to your issuing bank if you have any questions about how you will be receiving a refund sent to your canceled credit card.It’s been 5 days and I haven't received my refund!1.

THE CHRONOMASTER PROJECT has a solid band on his back, formed by experienced musicians with a common purpose: give life to Fabio Rancati's story with a fresh songwriting that follows step by step the Cronomante's adventures through time and space.
The great number of guest singers, each one will play a different character, will result in a journey full of surprises. You'll experience moments full of great metal impact, but also majestic melodies and evocative refrain that will be your guide in space.

<p><strong>Every country in the world has acknowledged the existence of climate change</strong>, but it is still a debate in the US - a country that many look to as an example. The reality is that many of us live in a bubble of denial, perpetuated by corruption in the media and government, which desensitize the masses and regulate truth.</p>
<p>How can we feel empathy when we see the world through our devices, and other people feed us the reality they want us to believe? <strong>Time is ticking</strong>, and indifference towards the environment keeps  growing.</p>
<p><strong>Science helps us understand facts, but music helps us experience them</strong>. Art helps us care about truths, which is why it can be a powerful medium for solving social and environmental issues. Because this cause calls for every person to become actively involved, <strong>the most effective solution will start with awakening the empathy of others.</strong></p>
<p>How to awaken empathy? This is <strong>the first part of my solution</strong>: A project that combinesdeep human emotion, powerful lyrics and the vulnerability of the human voice.</p>
<p><strong>“Our Only Home, an Opera for the Planet”</strong> is a project whose primary mission is to motivate people toward a sense of responsibility towards our earth. Using<strong> music as the vessel </strong>to deliver a message of collaboration and love for the environment will effectively spark a desire in the audience to take action.<br/><br/><strong>The second part to my solution</strong>: to create a relationship between audience members and a non-profit organization. After becoming inspired, the audience would have access to the resources a non-profit organization can provide. Establishing this connection would allow the audience to develop their feelings into actions. When the significance of our actions are tangible and recognized, we are then encouraged to become and remain <strong>active participants in our community.</strong></p>
<p>In February 2017, this project won the<strong> San Francisco’s Conservatory of Music Development Grant</strong>. Aside from boosting our social media signal, being awarded this grant drew the interest of Canadian artists and Mexican journalists, who wish to bring this project to their countries.</p>
<p><strong>Artistically</strong>, we are well on our way, with the music composed, the libretto in nearly final stages, and a majority of necessary personnel recruited. Our<strong> next step </strong>is to consider logistics. <strong>What we need most is financial support, in order to compensate personnel, purchase materials for the production, rent a venue, and fund promotional materials.</strong></p>
<p>Our musicians and community are eager and ready to get to work. We have the necessary talent and desire to create a project that will help change society, but <strong>we need the financial help to make this project feasible. </strong></p>

<h3>Who are Heg &amp; The Wolf Chorus?</h3>
<p>Heg &amp; The Wolf Chorus are a theatrical folk band from Bristol. The band has been born out of Heg Brignall's story-inspired songwriting and create original music, rooted in folk tradition. The band received critical acclaim for their debut album 'Raising The Fires', with national press, radio and awards for their work. They have performed across the country on headline tours and festivals and have received funding from EFDSS (English Folk Dance and Song Society) for the development of their second album. </p>
<p>The early part of 2018 was spent working in collaboration with Bristol-based company <strong><a href=""http://www.cirquebijou.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cirque Bijou</a> </strong>on the one-off spectacle circus performance <i>Portolan, </i>which was performed at Sunderland's Tall Ships Races in July. Two high wire walkers (Chris Bullzini and Johanne Humbert) crossed a 200 metre long, 30 metre high wire across the River Wear to an original, purpose written soundtrack by Heg. The music was also accompanied by a 50-strong local community choir. </p>
<p>The aim of this campaign is to raise enough funds to create a studio recording of the music which was written about and for the city of Sunderland. Creating a CD of the soundtrack would offer a memento of the show. </p>
<p>Heg's parents and extended family are all from Seaham, very close to Sunderland, and so this project and this music has been created with deep connection to the area. It would be wonderful way to celebrate the city and it's stories.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To make the EP a reality, we need to raise a minimum of <strong>£3000</strong>. This will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>studio hire</li>
<li>musicians fees</li>
<li>engineers and mixing time</li>
<li>mastering</li>
<li>CD duplication </li>
</ul>
<p>If we go over our target, we will be able to pay for some extra publicity for the CD. </p>
<p>The campaign is for pre-orders of the CD, so your contribution will get you a copy of the CD, delivered to your door.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, we will do one of the following:</p>

</div></div>","Who are Heg & The Wolf Chorus?
Heg & The Wolf Chorus are a theatrical folk band from Bristol. The band has been born out of Heg Brignall's story-inspired songwriting and create original music, rooted in folk tradition. The band received critical acclaim for their debut album 'Raising The Fires', with national press, radio and awards for their work. They have performed across the country on headline tours and festivals and have received funding from EFDSS (English Folk Dance and Song Society) for the development of their second album. 
The early part of 2018 was spent working in collaboration with Bristol-based company Cirque Bijou on the one-off spectacle circus performance Portolan, which was performed at Sunderland's Tall Ships Races in July. Two high wire walkers (Chris Bullzini and Johanne Humbert) crossed a 200 metre long, 30 metre high wire across the River Wear to an original, purpose written soundtrack by Heg. The music was also accompanied by a 50-strong local community choir. 
The aim of this campaign is to raise enough funds to create a studio recording of the music which was written about and for the city of Sunderland. Creating a CD of the soundtrack would offer a memento of the show. 
Heg's parents and extended family are all from Seaham, very close to Sunderland, and so this project and this music has been created with deep connection to the area. It would be wonderful way to celebrate the city and it's stories.

What We Need & What You Get
To make the EP a reality, we need to raise a minimum of £3000. This will cover:

studio hire
musicians fees
engineers and mixing time
mastering
CD duplication 

If we go over our target, we will be able to pay for some extra publicity for the CD. 
The campaign is for pre-orders of the CD, so your contribution will get you a copy of the CD, delivered to your door.
If we don't reach our goal, we will do one of the following:

If the amount is too low to be able to go forward, we will refund your money in full
If we make close to our target, we will go forward with the recording and cut some corners in order to keep costs down, for example, aim to record it in less time than is ideal. 


Other Ways You Can Help

<h3>S.AF.E Virtual Music Festival May 7th-10th</h3>
<p>Sober AF Entertainment wants to give the masses things to do when you are stuck at home! A FREE Virtual Music Festival called S.AF.E which stands for Sober AF Entertainment but coincidently works out in another way cause we all want to “Stay Safe” from this pandemic ravaging the world. I truly wish I could fund the whole virtual event so no one has to spend money because I want to give the world a gift during these hard times, but I can’t do it alone. Help us put on the first free successful virtual music festival.</p>
<p><u><strong>We want to take live-streaming and put it together in a music festival format. All the artists in one place.</strong></u></p>
<p>In Italy, people are playing music off their balconies and they have caught a lot of attention around the world. We were working on this virtual music festival before the people in Italy started playing off their balconies. Thanks to them, it helped solidify our decision to move forward with the S.AF.E virtual music festival. At night, I can barely sleep due to the fact that I am very excited about this opportunity and thinking of new ideas every day and night. During the event, we will be having competitions such as best meme creations, best photo caption, funny video contests, best tips of things to do when you are stuck at home, selfie contests, and share a photo contest. Also, we are going to have an award show at the end of the event not only announcing the most liked performed artist but also for the raffle, contest winners and a sweepstake winner. </p>
<p>Before the major event, we are planning to have multiple free virtual events leading up to the S.AF.E Virtual Music Festival. Sober AF Entertainment will be streaming on our website and across multiple platforms all at once so no one can miss it! You will be able to discover new artists you will fall in love with and see artists you are already in love with! Get excited about this because we are! Spread the word and get the world involved. We are alone at home, but let’s come together as a virtual community.</p>
<p>Artists will be live streaming, for FREE, from our site SoberAFE.com, Facebook, Instagram, Youtube and more. We want to live stream events before the festival to keep everyone entertained. We truly desire to give something people to watch and be entertained while everything is happening. This event will have interactive chat and video rooms during virtual events. There will also be links to other in place virtual experiences such as virtual museum tours. Also, we will have virtual competitions:</p>
<ul>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Everything in the world is going haywire! Artists and Festivals all over are canceling or postponing due to the novel Coronavirus. What is there to do? Sit at home and watch old videos? Read the same worrisome stories about what is going on around the world? Since artists and festivals have had to cancel or postpone their events. We are very disappointed we can't go to a concert and see our favorite artists. What if you didn't have to leave home to experience a concert to see and hear your favorite artists? Right now, Sober AF Entertainment sees an opportunity to support the US and the World to give them something to do and compete in fun competitions around the world while being constantly entertained. From our research, it seems like no one in the world has been able to pull off a massive Virtual Music Festival with entertaining things to do during the event, successfully. Help Sober AF Entertainment bring support to the world during these worrisome times!</p>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>Skata Vibration is an eclectic Afro-psychedelic band from Lagos, Nigeria. Our band is a reflection of the depth of brotherhood, depth, art, commitment and passion that the spirit which is music brings. The band has Adey (drums), Jad (lead guitar), Laughter (bass) and Stiques (vocals).</p>
<p>Our music is a blend of ancient northern Nigerian music, funk, grunge, jazz and rock in a twist we like to call Afro-psychedelic rock.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We would require funding to cover flights, accommodation and basic logistics.</p>
<ul>
<li>Flights; from Lagos to London, from London back to Lagos.</li>
<li>Accommodation in a hostel close to the event venue.</li>
<li>Rehearsal studio and feeding.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are accepting funding in exchange for limited physical signed copies of our first album, free tickets to see us perform at the biggest Afrobeats festival in the world ""FELABRATION"", in October, 2018.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This opportunity will offer us a chance to showcase our kind of music. Currently in Nigeria, the Afro-pop genre has the entire mainstream and has made things difficult for a unique band to succeed. Being able to showcase ourselves outside Nigeria gives us leverage; for booking gigs internally, to be able to perform more in Nigeria and expand our fan base. Also, to be able to create a new path for musicians with a stronger message to believe that they do not have to change their uniqueness to fit in!</p>
<h3><strong>How Much Is On The Line?</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>Honestly, we have everything on the line for this opportunity! We organized a fundraiser concert, sent out emails, sold some personal valuables and have been beyond humble seeking funds in every way we can.</p>
<p>Partly, we feel like if we are unable to showcase, we might come up short; as people without enough drive to scale beyond our limitations. On the other hand, the entire process of seeking for resources have deepened our bond and given us a deeper sense of togetherness that is good for us as a band.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I have been playing the Ukulele for over 10 years! I went to school for music and taught band and orchestra for 10 years. I love Video Games, Anime, Sci-fi and anything geeky! And I love to create, arrange my music and direct my music videos! Which is where I need your help! I have been funding (along with the amazing time of some amazingly creative people) my music videos for my YouTube channel for the last year. In a year we have been able to create 6 fully conceptualized music videos! And I want to get a few more out before the end of the year, and that is where I need your help!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to do this we need a little help getting them done, The money made to create these will go towards, Better instrumental recording for the tracks, Money to be able to use better locations (so far I have relied on the resources around me, but there are two videos coming up that I want to use areas that are not free to use.), as well as other aspects that I cannot do out of pocket. </p>
<ul>
<li>Each video I do takes about $200 out of pocket expenses from me, having a slightly larger budget means we can go all out on them!</li>
<li>The perks are low on this one since they are thank you's at the end of the videos and an EP download of the Ukulele pieces I have recorded so far (along with the newest videos track as well!) </li>
<li>All funds made in this will go to create the next three videos (October Video, Original Piece that is being written for me, Harry Potter theme and/or Game of Thrones theme (I want to use the same location, so both may happen), and Holiday video. So technically four videos, but the Holiday video doesn't take much money to do) If it is not all used on that it will also go towards the videos after that, anything made in this will go straight to other videos. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> The geek music scene is strong, and I love making music and playing concerts. Being able to show that the Ukulele can have the same response as the Violin or other string instruments and not just be the ""toy instrument"" is important to me and everyone out there who plays it! Also getting to listen to your favorite geeky tunes in a new form is always really fun as well!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Risks of this project not being completely funded? Just means that it will take longer for each video to come out. So far I have two confirmed videos for the remainder of the year that will be made no matter what. I would love to be able to film the other two this year and get them out early next year, but if we don't make the funding then they will be filmed next year. </p>
<p>If I end up making more? then the money will go into producing the videos after the ones on this list! So any money made on this Indiegogo (and my <a href=""http://www.patreon.com/AngelaPritchett"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Patreon</a>) goes straight into making the music videos for my <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/c/angelaplaysukulele"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">YouTube Channel</a> bigger and better! </p>

I have been playing the Ukulele for over 10 years! I went to school for music and taught band and orchestra for 10 years. I love Video Games, Anime, Sci-fi and anything geeky! And I love to create, arrange my music and direct my music videos! Which is where I need your help! I have been funding (along with the amazing time of some amazingly creative people) my music videos for my YouTube channel for the last year. In a year we have been able to create 6 fully conceptualized music videos! And I want to get a few more out before the end of the year, and that is where I need your help!

What We Need & What You Get
In order to do this we need a little help getting them done, The money made to create these will go towards, Better instrumental recording for the tracks, Money to be able to use better locations (so far I have relied on the resources around me, but there are two videos coming up that I want to use areas that are not free to use.), as well as other aspects that I cannot do out of pocket. 

Each video I do takes about $200 out of pocket expenses from me, having a slightly larger budget means we can go all out on them!
The perks are low on this one since they are thank you's at the end of the videos and an EP download of the Ukulele pieces I have recorded so far (along with the newest videos track as well!) 
All funds made in this will go to create the next three videos (October Video, Original Piece that is being written for me, Harry Potter theme and/or Game of Thrones theme (I want to use the same location, so both may happen), and Holiday video. So technically four videos, but the Holiday video doesn't take much money to do) If it is not all used on that it will also go towards the videos after that, anything made in this will go straight to other videos. 


The Impact
 The geek music scene is strong, and I love making music and playing concerts. Being able to show that the Ukulele can have the same response as the Violin or other string instruments and not just be the ""toy instrument"" is important to me and everyone out there who plays it! Also getting to listen to your favorite geeky tunes in a new form is always really fun as well!

Risks & Challenges
Risks of this project not being completely funded? Just means that it will take longer for each video to come out. So far I have two confirmed videos for the remainder of the year that will be made no matter what. I would love to be able to film the other two this year and get them out early next year, but if we don't make the funding then they will be filmed next year. 
If I end up making more? then the money will go into producing the videos after the ones on this list! So any money made on this Indiegogo (and my Patreon) goes straight into making the music videos for my YouTube Channel bigger and better!

<p>Hello there Devils, and thank you for taking the time to consider helping us with what will be our most ambitious and rewarding project yet! We know you’re busy, so let’s get straight to who we are, and what we do.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align=""center""><strong>About Us</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We’re a five piece, female fronted ‘character metal’ band. What’s that you say? In a nutshell, we choose a popular character and create a song from the ground up to musically, lyrically, and vocally fit their personality and tell their story. Our vocalist, Evilyn, writes the songs and then, as a band, we breathe life into them to make them a reality.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align=""center""><strong>About Our Music</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The style of music is tailored to suit the character, and the vocal performance is designed to impersonate/act out that character. One example is our song, I Bathe in Blood, which is an ode to the 16<sup>th</sup> Century Hungarian serial killer, Countess Elizabeth Bathory. This song has a distinctly Baroque/Renaissance musical feel to it to fit the era in which Bathory lived, and is sung entirely with a Hungarian accent to capture who she was.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align=""center""><strong>About The Vision</strong></p>
<p>Our most recent metal homage is to the cult horror movie, Jennifer's Body. The song itself is recorded and ready for your ears, but, in typical Halo fashion, we want to go all out for it! We want to produce a full on, boy eating, bloody, goretastically brutal music video to do this justice, and to make sure this song travels as far and wide as it possibly can. We want to show the world our very own brand of metal; character metal and just how awesome it can be. For this to happen, WE NEED <u>YOU</u> TO CHEER US ON!</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>About The Video</strong></p>
<p>This cinematic style production will be produced and directed by Neon Temple who have an 18 year history of creating music videos and TV commercials for many well recognised names. All sequences shot will be with a full professional crew in a studio and sound stage and as well as all the usual trappings of a feature style production such as this there will also be award winning prosthetic and creature effects artists who will be providing all the lovely bloody stuff! In post it will be edited and colour graded in the style of the original American film of which the theme of the track is based on.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is £3,500 to maximise the potential of our production; the more we receive, the more we can do! We have a lot of ideas for this video and we want to be able to execute them all!</p>
<p>Of course, our Devils (YOU) are as much a part of this as we are and we want everyone to get something out of it along the way! A few perks you can achieve from the funding of this campaign are:</p>
<p>- Instant access to the music video's track 'Fearleader'</p>
<p>- Instant access to an instrumental piano version of Diabolus</p>
<p>- Crowdfund exclusive merchandise to let the world know you were involved in the making of world domination later! </p>
<p>- Exclusive art designed by our very own Evilyn!</p>
<p>- Personalised thank you from the band so we can let you know exactly how much you mean to us as the Devil BFFs (Best Freakin' Fans!)</p>
<p>- A chance to be ON SET with us as we produce the music video as well as TAKE PART IN THE MUSIC VIDEO! </p>
<p>- One very lucky fan gets to choose the next character to be immortalised in song!</p>
<p>The list for perks and prizes goes on and on! </p>
<p>All the money funded will go straight to the production of the video. As said before; the more we get, the more we can do! </p>
<p align=""center""><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Your favourite band doesn't create music and art to fuel their own happiness, they do it for their fans and for the love of music; we're no different. You Devils are the reason we do what we do individually and together. Your contribution to this campaign makes it possible for us to build upon a community of music fans, so throw your horns up and show pride in what you love!</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>We understand more than anyone that this is asking a lot of you and you may not have the financial freedom to back what you love. However, our end-goal is to build a foundation of fans who can relate to each other through the power and love of Music, TV and Film. You can help us in achieving this goal by sharing the campaign with your friends and making some noise about the campaign. This action can be achieved with one click of a share tool across multiple social media sites. All we can reward you with is a guaranteed continued passion for making music and art, as well as our sincere thanks, but, if you want more...you know what you have to do! <br/><br/>LET'S GO DEVILS! </p>

<p> Im a Portuguese/German Singer-Songwriter and Filmmaker who studied Philosophy in Berlin and Medicine in South America and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Nowadays I am fully dedicated to crafting my art. <i>Everything you hear or see of my art is self taught</i>: the instruments, the music production, Film directing, editing, the paintings etc.</p>

<h3>Hello</h3>
<p>We are The Medlars, a seven piece contemporary folk based in London. We take influence from the folk tradition as well as rock, classical and psychedelic music.</p>
<p>We released our debut album ""The Medlars"" earlier this year and are now looking at releasing a double A-side single.</p>
<p>We want this release to be as much about the art and film as it is about the music itself. So we've teamed up with the filmmaker Joseph Fitz and the artist Marijke Keyser who are going to be working with us on a music video and an animation for the two tracks. Marijke is also going to be designing posters and postcards with download codes on which we'll be releasing the single instead of on CD.</p>
<p>Without your help in this campaign we won't be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Record our tracks</li>
<li>Mix the tracks</li>
<li>Master the tracks</li>
<li>Pay for promotion of the release</li>
<li>Pay for the production of posters and postcards</li>
<li>Cover the costs for the making of the film and animation</li>
</ul>
<p>So we really need your help to make this release a reality.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>We need to raise a minimum of £2000.<br/>This will pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recording for 2 days - £640</li>
<li>Mixing for 1 day - £320</li>
<li>Mastering £60 per song -£120</li>
<li>Session trumpet player (that's right we're getting a trumpet in!) - £150</li>
<li>Promotion (bare minimum) - £250</li>
<li>Covering Joseph’s costs of film (minimum) - £200</li>
<li>Covering Marijke’s cost for animation and artwork - £250</li>
<li>Printing 100 postcards with download codes - £50</li>
<li>Posters will be something that we either pay for ourselves or if we make more from the campaign we can use that to fund them.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we don't quite raise all the money we need then we in this campaign we'll start by recording and producing the tracks and go from there. It might take years, but we'll raise it somehow!</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Two beautiful songs (not to blow our own trumpet but these two are our best so far)</li>
<li>An amazing music video by Joseph Fitz with your name in the credits.</li>
<li>A incredible animation by Marijke Keyser with your name in the credits.</li>
<li>You'll receive the music before anyone else.</li>
<li>We'll be releasing a limited line of posters and post cards designed by Marijke Keyser and you'll be the first (and perhaps the only) people to receive them.</li>
<li>If we make over our campaign we are hoping to record a bonus track that will only be available to those of you who contributed!</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll be having a single launch gig next summer, it'll be one of the only opportunities to come see us live for the next year, if not longer.<br/>You'll get eternal love (platonic) and respect from all seven of us!</p>
<h3>How you can support us</h3>
<p>So you can pledge to us in lots of ways.<br/>You can buy:</p>
<ul>
<li>The poster (with a download code for the tracks) - £15</li>
<li>The postcard (with a download code for the tracks) - £5</li>
<li>Download of the double A-side - £3</li>
<li>Our first album ""The Medlars"" - £7</li>
<li>Ticket to our Single launch - £10</li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As many of you may know it's becoming more and more common for musicians and bands to start crowd funders for their releases.<br/>We released our first album off our own backs and we are still feeling the weight of those costs today. <br/>Without your help we would not be able to carry on creating the music we love.<br/>So if you love music that hasn't become commercialised and like what we've done in the past then please support our campaign</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The next year</h3>
<p>So we have a lot of work to get started, what with the recording, mixing, mastering, promoting and production of films and posters, but we cannot wait to be in the studio again and to be sharing our music, film and art with you!</p>

<p>Hola, soy Luis Escobar. Soy un recién graduado de la Licenciatura en Música de la Universidad del Valle de Guatemala (UVG), tengo 25 años y me he especializado en la ejecución de la Guitarra Clásica.</p>
<p>Recientemente recibí la buena noticia de ser admitido en el programa de Maestría en Interpretación de Guitarra Clásica en la Universidad de Alicante (España). Esta es una oportunidad muy valiosa para mí y para mi país, ya que estamos convencidos de que la ciencia, el arte y la cultura son pilares sólidos para una sociedad más justa y emprendedora.</p>
<p>Con su apoyo para que pueda finalizar exitosamente este programa, habrá contribuido al hecho de que no solo yo, sino muchos guitarristas y músicos guatemaltecos tengan la oportunidad de mejorar la cultura artística del país. Con su valioso aporte estará ayudando a progresar en las aulas de las universidades y escuelas de nuestra nación para que muchos jóvenes despierten su pasión por el arte y muchos otros caminos profesionales destinados a la humanización de la sociedad, que ahora tanto se necesita.</p>
<p>Por supuesto, este gran proyecto va más allá de un programa de maestría; ya que con esta visión será posible abrir el espacio para que más guatemaltecos puedan aprovechar esta y otras grandes oportunidades en todo el mundo. Este es solo el primer paso para lograr que la calidad artística en mi entorno mejore exponencialmente y que se apoyen más este tipo de iniciativas que, en conjunto, pueden contribuir a la mejora de la calidad de vida y la sensibilidad.</p>
<p>Este programa tiene un costo total de € 8,000 (aproximadamente $9,400) que incluye la matrícula y los pagos mensuales exigidos por la Universidad. Es por eso que solicito su generosa ayuda para comenzar este programa en enero de 2019 y regresar a mi país con la experiencia y el conocimiento necesarios para contribuir positivamente en su desarrollo. Gracias por su apoyo.</p>

<p>Hi, I'm Luis Escobar. I am a recent graduate of the Bachelor of Music at Universidad del Valle de Guatemala (UVG), I am 25 years old and I have specialized in Classical Guitar Performance.</p>
<p>Recently I received the good news of being admitted to the Master's Program in Classical Guitar Performance at Universidad de Alicante (Spain). This is a very valuable opportunity for me and for my country, since we are convinced that science, art and culture are solid pillars for a more fair and enterprising society.</p>
<p>With your support for successful completion of this program, you will have contributed to the fact that not only me, but many Guatemalan guitarists and musicians have the opportunity to improve the country's artistic culture. With your valuable contribution you will be helping to progress in the classrooms of universities and schools of my nation so that many young people awaken their passion for art and many other career paths to the humanization of society, which is so much needed today.</p>
<p>Of course, this great project goes beyond a master's program; since with this vision it will be possible to open the chances so more Guatemalans can take advantage of this and other great opportunities throughout the world. This is only the first step to ensure that the artistic quality in my environment will improve exponentially, which together can contribute to the improvement of the quality of life and sensitivity.</p>
<p>This program has a total cost of € 8,000 (approximately $ 9,400) which includes tuition and monthly payments required by the University. That is why I request your generous help to start this program in January 2019 and return to my country with the necessary experience and knowledge to contribute positively in my development.

<p>Short Summary</p>
<h2><strong>WHO AM I?</strong></h2>
<p>Hi! I'm Douglas Allen, singer-songwriter in Nashville, Tennessee. Prior to Nashville, I made music under the moniker Blood &amp; Dust in San Francisco, California.  I've been writing songs for the past ten years, making my first record in 2014 as B&amp;D. I've been lucky and blessed to write songs professionally these past two years since moving to Nashville, having a song placement on CBS' Hawaii 5-0, working with various country artists, placing in several Nashville songwriting competitions, and even playing a spot on Nashville's indie radio station Lightning 100.  During this time I've been patiently waiting to release new music to YOU and the world. </p>
<h2><strong>WHAT'S UP?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>I'm making a record (with YOUR help of course)!</strong> My first Nashville written, recorded, and produced album. I'm calling this record ""Chasing Down A Ghost"" and it's a collection of songs I'm really proud of. The songs center around chasing down a person, a thing, or an idea that you just can't quite grasp and in the end you're left with just yourself, learning to love yourself, those closest to you and ultimately finding peace within.</p>
<p>A few months ago I became friends with Grammy-winning producer Mitch Dane of Sputnik Sound. He's a great guy but he's also a great producer (seriously, check out and listen to some of the albums he has produced). He stumbled upon some of my songs and we set up a time to meet. After hearing some of my new songs he said ""We should make a record together!"" I cannot lie, those words both floored me and scared me. It would mean raising ample support and a lot of hard work, how in the world could I ever do it. SOOOO, Here we are! </p>
<p>I think ""Chasing Down A Ghost"" are the best songs I've ever written; imagine some old Motown, with a dash of Zepplin, mixed with the cleverly real lyrics of John Prine.  I humbly and desperately want to share these songs with YOU but I need Your Help. </p>
<p>Here are some examples of the sounds we are shooting for:  <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7sEbeQWLZlvT351cQwaPJR"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CAMPAIGN PLAYLIST</a></p>
<h2><strong>MEET MITCH DANE</strong></h2>

</div><div>
<h2><strong>WHAT WE NEED?</strong></h2>
<p>Are <strong>YOU</strong> ready? I am asking for 21K. Dollars you ask? Precious Gems? Handshakes? Well my country of origin is the USA so I'm humbly asking for 21K in dollars and I'm adding an additional flex goal of 5K.</p>
<p><strong>What does that cover?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>2 weeks studio time and recording: </strong>Sounds like a lot of time? Making a good record takes time. Every session needs to be setup and paced.  We start by arranging the songs as a road map, set up mics and tune guitars and then we take multiple runs to get the best result.</li>
<li>
<strong>Mixing:</strong> After recording Mitch adds in all the cool sounds that we may not have recorded with instruments, locks in all the levels, vocals, guitars, drums etc.</li>
<li>
<strong>Musicians:</strong> We are spending 14 days in the studio - having great musicians helps make that process smooth and FUN! And just like any job, I need to compensate them for their work. I could bring in an uncle and a cousin to play drums and bass but believe me, you DON'T want that.</li>
<li><strong>Flex goals go toward mastering and distribution.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>WHAT DO YOU GET? </strong></h2>
<p>My team and I have worked to come up with some cool perks to reward you for your generosity, your participation, and your heart! For detailed perk breakdowns you can find them in the right column but they are pretty cool.</p>
<p>You'll of course get your own copy of ""Chasing Down a Ghost"" but what if you want more? Want a personal music lesson? A personal song or a co-write? A video blog chronicling the making of the record? A personal house show for you and your buds? A guitar - pictured below - owned by and employed by yours truly? All of these could be yours in addition to knowing you helped make it happen!</p>
<p>What if we don't make the goal? Where does that money go? I will still be hitting the studio! This project may take a little longer than planned. But you have my promise that anything raised goes into bringing these songs to life. </p>

<h2><strong>IMPACT - WHY BOTHER?</strong></h2>
</div><div>
<p>I mean you don't have to give or be a part of this campaign :( I'd be happy to give you a hi-five in the street if we bump into each other. You can also support lots of other music out there, really, there's a lot. But with this project you get Mitch and Doug; you get two guys concerned with making really good music/art, better, you get our hearts, and our blood, sweat, and tears poured into this album.</p>
<p>I'm also hoping that these songs start to get played in and eventually outside of Nashville. When you give to this campaign you are making independent music live and breathe. You are a producer yourself!</p>
<h2><strong>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</strong></h2>
</div><div>
<p>The obvious risk and challenge is that we could miss our goal. It happens - sometimes you go big and go home. It's possible that our extensive planning for this campaign falls flat. However, I've never been more encouraged and confident that this goal can be reached. The next 60 days will have my undivided commitment to make this campaign succeed with your goodwill and help.</p>
<p>In addition, I want to know that this isn't my first time in a professional recording studio. I want you to know we will be working from the time we get in until we leave. I've been lucky to record in Northern California and even a bit here in Nashville. It's an environment that feels like home these days. I feel confident and excited to make this music a reality.  </p>
<h2><strong>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP </strong></h2>
</div><div>
<p>Can't contribute? I get it. I'm a musician - I'm eating ramen right now. But, if you have a smartphone, social media accounts, or a computer you can help us get there. You have friends and they have friends. If you share this campaign and ask them to contribute or share, then we are cooking. Indiegogo has share tools which make it easy to spread the word. ALSO reach out and become part of my street team!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I've been a songwriter/musician since I was 14 and my dad bought me a guitar for Christmas. Prior to this, it was all just for fun. However, my own family felt the effect of loss during the COVID pandemic. The music on this album started during that time and now I want to share it with all the surviving families of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Studies estimate that for every death, an average of 9 additional family members are effected. That means there are over 4 million people affected in the US alone and millions more around the world. The music on this album is specially dedicated to those families as a means of emotional support, inspiration and motivation.</p>
<p>Together, we can share this small piece of support and affect their lives in a positive way.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I will provide the sound engineering, mixing and producing to reduce costs.</p>
<p>All funds raised will be put towards advertising in order to attempt to reach all the families who have been effected. </p>
<p>Perks will include a digital copy of the full album upon release and sheet music for all relevant songs.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will help us reach more of the people that need this support.</p>
<p>This music may also be purchased as a gift, if you know of a surviving family or person who needs it. While it's intended for this specific audience. It can be given to anyone who may need inspiration or motivation.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are short on time and currently the album is set to launch on 12 March 2021. I will work day in and day out to ensure this material get's out to this audience.  I have managed several large and complicated projects in my professional career and I will personally ensure this is music reaches the maximum number of people.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot support this campaign monetarily, then please just share it with those around you, whether on social media, personal conversation, email, etc. The more people we reach, the bigger difference we can make. To make it really easy, use the Indiegogo share tools!</p>

<h3>Into The Great Unknown</h3>
<p>This is basically a pre-sell campaign for the third New American Farmers LP release. You buy the CD or vinyl now, and we can put the finishing touches on manufacturing and promoting our album release. The basics were recorded in a state of the art studio just down the street from us, so we're keeping it local. The musicians are local as well, all living here in the bay area. You may have heard of some of them! Visit our page at <a href=""https://newamericanfarmers.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bandcamp</a> to check out our previous releases. </p>
<p><strong>Sample track from the LP: </strong> <strong><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/paulmichaelknowles/44-1-right-before-our-eyes-mix-6-mastered"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">R</a></strong><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/paulmichaelknowles/44-1-right-before-our-eyes-mix-6-mastered"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>ight Before Our Eyes</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Drums:</strong> Nigel Twist from one of our favorite all time 80's folk/punk/rock bands, The Alarm, finally joins us on every track of the album this time out.

This is basically a pre-sell campaign for the third New American Farmers LP release. You buy the CD or vinyl now, and we can put the finishing touches on manufacturing and promoting our album release. The basics were recorded in a state of the art studio just down the street from us, so we're keeping it local. The musicians are local as well, all living here in the bay area. You may have heard of some of them! Visit our page at Bandcamp to check out our previous releases. 
Sample track from the LP:  Right Before Our Eyes
Drums: Nigel Twist from one of our favorite all time 80's folk/punk/rock bands, The Alarm, finally joins us on every track of the album this time out. He's been appearing with us on drums for our live shows for a few years now. Check out the discography here.
Bass: Kevin T. White has also been with us in the studio and on the stage for a few years now. There is NO ONE better to hold down the bottom end than Kevin. You can read Kevin's bio here.

<h2>Project Summary.</h2>
<p>La Grande Bande is partnering with Sibley East’s Middle/High School music department to produce an educational and community program (May 8-10) for the music students at Sibley East and for the greater Sibley East region (Gaylord, Arlington, Green Isle, MN).</p>
<p>Each component of our proposal is designed</p>
<ul>
<li>To provide creative musical programming</li>
<li>To provide well-rounded educational programming</li>
</ul>
<p>Each part will illustrate the cultural and historical significance of the selected music in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Europe.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>About the Ensemble.</h3>
<p>La Grande Bande is a project-based Period Instrument Orchestra founded as a non-profit organization by Michael Thomas Asmus* in 2011. We strive to create innovative, unique, and inspiring musical programs that are played on the instruments premiere audiences might have heard.</p>
<p>When we present “masterworks” alongside lesser-known compositions, we demonstrate the extensive musical production during the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries. By using program notes, directed-educational events, or other methods, we inform our audiences about the vast array of music at our fingertips—this is crucial to our mission.</p>
<p>We see incredible value in resurrecting the music written by the great known and unknown masters of our past; it's a historical, cultural, and musical lesson...rolled into one. </p>
<p><i>*Michael is a 2009 graduate of Sibley East. </i></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What We Want To Do.</h2>
<p>Our program <span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>will provide over 225 Sibley East students with the opportunity </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>to learn about Baroque music,</span></li>
<li><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>to learn about important historical figures, and </span></li>
<li><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>to learn about uniquely Baroque instruments </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>through </span></p>
<ul>
<li>a performance/lecture</li>
<li><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>masterclasses, and</span></li>
<li><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>open rehearsals</span></li>
</ul>
<p><font>presented by La Grande Bande's Baroque music specialists</font></p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>We will also </span></p>
<ul><li><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>provide the greater Sibley East community with a world-class artistic performance only available to major metropolitan areas.</span></li></ul>
<h3>Performance/Lecture.</h3>
<p>Another educational component of our project is a 30- to 35-minute performance/lecture presented by several LGB artists. Students will be able to</p>
<ul>
<li>hear demonstrations of Baroque instruments, such as the viola da gamba and harpsichord</li>
<li>learn about important historical figures, like George Friderich Handel and Elisabeth-Claude Jacquet de la Guerre</li>
<li>see their masterclass instructors perform </li>
</ul>
<h3>Masterclass Sessions.</h3>
<p>Our project will provide Sibley East music students with the opportunity to participate in three, 45- to 60-minute masterclasses given by LGB’s New York-based Artists. These sessions will allow students to learn about Baroque music one-on-one with our artists.</p>
<p>Topics of discussion include, Baroque performance practice, diction for singers, and more. Their classmates will also be able to observe these unique sessions. Participants will be pre-selected by Sibley East's music teachers.</p>
<ul></ul>
<h3>Open Rehearsals. </h3>
<p>Ensemble rehearsals are normally off limits to the general public. As a part of this project, La Grande Bande will allow Sibley East students to observe all of our rehearsals as their class schedules permit. (We are also making our rehearsal on May 10 open to the public.)</p>
<p>Having a chance to observe our rehearsals will give students, and members of the community,</p>
<ul>
<li>an inside-look at how we work,</li>
<li>to see what it's like to be a professional musician, and</li>
<li>to see how much fun we have together. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Community Benefits.</h3>
<p>At the culmination of LGB's project, we will present a full-length ticketed concert ($5, $7, $10) on May 10.  The program will include an assortment of sacred and secular Baroque pieces for instruments and singers...written by some of the eras best known and unknown composers. </p>
<p>Our program booklet will include translations of non-English texts and extensive program notes, highlighting important and fascinating information about the pieces we will perform. </p>
<p>La Grande Bande is opening our afternoon rehearsal on May 10 to the general public, giving you a chance to see us in action before our concert. </p>
<h3>Project Outcomes</h3>
<p>This program will</p>
<ul>
<li>foster interest in classical music by interacting directly with our community’s young performers;</li>
<li>it will engage Sibley East music students, and the greater community, through creative, unique, and exceptional musical programming;</li>
<li>it will provide an underserved community with a high-quality artist performance.</li>
</ul>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>What We Need. </h2>
<p>With a total budget of $9,000, we need to raise approximately $1,500 through individual contributions to make this project possible. </p>
<p>These funds will help us to</p>
<ul>
<li>pay our artists (13),</li>
<li>cover artist travel/lodging expenses, and</li>
<li>pay for instrument rental (harpsichord)</li>
</ul>
<p>so we can create an educational program that provides many benefits to the Sibley East students and the greater community.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What You Get.</h2>
<p>By supporting this project you will provide an incredible educational and artistic experience to more than 225 students and to a wonderful community. As a thank you, you can also elect to receive any one of our perks. </p>

Drummer, Terri Lyne Carrington joined the band on the second night.Upon their triumphant return to Chicago, Laura was besieged by unbelievable news that led to a vicissitude of “life happenings”, that persisted for 25-years.The Shocking News:After all the other “life happening” events (the worst of which includes the shocking erasure of the studio multi-track master tape), much later, Laura’s career as a singer songwriter all but ended with a rare vocal-chord paralysis that prevented her voice from producing a tone.Coinciding with her full recovery in 2016, came the re-discovery of two small DAT stereo rough mix  digital tapes from both the 1994 studio recording (95% original music) and from the first night at the North Sea Jazz Festival  (consisting of 95% jazz standard repertoire).  Miraculously, the rough mixes from the studio project were deemed to be esthetically of 85% performance quality for a commercial release.   On Laura’s birthday, May 16, 2018, her “Olori Live At The North Sea jazz Festival” recording was released on the Sonic Portraits Jazz label receiving domestic and international airplay. On the day before (May 15, 2018) Terri Lyne Carrington (now recipient of two recent Grammy Awards) and James Cammack (bassist for Ahmad Jamaal) returned to Chicago to re-record two songs for the studio album: “Cat’s Out On A Stroll” and “Free As a Child” along with a new holiday tune penned by project producer, Robert Irving III (recent recipient of two Lifetime Achievement Awards) and Laura. While in Chicago, Wallace Roney (the only trumpet player directly mentored by the legendary Miles Davis) also added his amazing trumpet to these three selections.The First Project ""Review""In March of 1994 after receiving a preview demo recording of the Laura Walls ""Free As A Child"" project, Rod Echols at WHPK Radio wrote, “I feel that this project rates as one of the top two vocal projects I’ve heard this year— it stands along-side of Dee Dee Bridgewater’s latest CD… its refreshing to hear some new vocal repertoire.”  Now in 2019 the musicians featured on the project and others agree that this project is just as fresh today. It could be that this project was just 25-years ahead of its time. Many anticipate the release as the opening of a bottle of red wine aged for 25-years.What remains towards the completion and post-production are:-Horn and String Arrangements for Holiday tune--Re-recording of two entire rhythm tracks with vocals/horns-Overdub sessions; Vocals, horns on three tracks-Editing Sessions (above 5 tracks)-Final Mix Session-Mastering Session (Combining new recordings with those from 1994)-Artist Photo Shoot-Album Art and Graphic Design-Manufacturing/Shipping of product-PR Campaign (Print media)-Radio Promotion Campaign (including mailing to 300 radio stations)

</h3>
<div>Vor einiger Zeit haben sich Musiker, Künstler und Interessierte zusammengeschlossen und trafen sich, um den Techno wieder zu beleben. Aus der Idee wurde ein Verein, aus den Plänen Wirklichkeit. Veranstaltungen wie z.B. ""Der Zirkus ist in der Stadt"" oder ""NEON"" wurden von uns umgesetzt und unterstützt. Wir haben nun beschlossen, abgesehen von den weiter laufenden Veranstaltungsreihen, ein Vereinshaus zu schaffen, um ab November/Dezember 2015 dort einen gemeinnützigen Club zu eröffnen! Denn wo kann man vor den Toren Frankfurts noch zu moderner Musik tanzen? <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Doch es geht nicht ausschließlich um Techno:</span>
</div>
<div>Unsere Ziele sind:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Eröffnung des Vereinshauses (""Tabakmühle"")<br/>
</li>

<div>Ausgegeben wird das Startkapital für größere Anlagen, mehr DJs und mehr gemeinnützige Förderungen.</div>

Danach finanziert sich die Tabakmühle selbst, was durch niedrige Immobilienpreise, gute Lage und Erwartung hoher Besucherzahlen begünstigt wird.</div>
<div>Das, was du also bekommst ist ein Club mit guter Musik in deiner Nähe (gut zu erreichen von Frankfurt am Main und Oberursel), die Möglichkeit neue Künste und Musikgenres kennen zu lernen sowie einen Raum, in dem auch deiner Kreativität keine Grenzen gesetzt sind. </div>

Der Verein erreicht
seine Ziele vor allem durch gutes Eigenmarketing über Flyer, markeneigene
Textilprodukte, Mitgliederkontakte („Networking“), soziale Netzwerke
(Facebook-Reichweite: ca. 3000 Personen), sowie durch die Hilfe von privaten
Unterstützern („Ehrenmitglieder“). Des Weiteren bildet der Verein als Plattform
für Künstler und Musiker ein beständiges Netzwerk, welches die gegenseitige
Unterstützung von Künstlern und Musikern begünstigt und fördert. 
Die Kommunikation der
Mitglieder untereinander wird hierzu vor allem durch die „Foekmo.org-App“ begünstigt, da diese über einen vereinseigenen
Mitglieder-Chatroom verfügt.

<h3>
<b style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;"">The Idea.</b><br/>
</h3> <p>Create an app (IOS/Android) that will allow the host of a party to create a server everyone can log into and vote for ""Whats Next"". </p>
<p>Easy to use and straight forward. Whip your phone out, vote for a few songs you would like to hear, check out Whats Next, upload 1 or 2 songs, or a playlist you have, put phone away, keep socializing/partying. All up, it would only take a minute or 3.</p>
<p>Compatible with both Android and Apple no one should be left out.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, Guests can upload their own music to the list if the host allows it. These songs can then be voted on by everyone. </p>
<p>Ultimately the Host is in control of the music. they may Pause, Play, Skip, Change, Choose songs just like a normal Music Player. </p>
<p>It will play songs that have been voted for, if no songs have been voted for it will just shuffle through whats on there.</p>
<p>So that is the basic idea without going into too much detail. There are many other features that will be implemented, such as more advanced hosting options, etc.</p>
<p><i>*At no time will ‘in-app’ purchases be essential for proper use of this application. All in-app purchases are purely cosmetic, affecting only app appearance or extra abilities (such as giving guests, with the free app, temporary premium access).

<h3>What is TourSmart?</h3>
<p>My name is Christopher Murray, I've been in multiple metal acts for almost 6 years now as a vocalist touring my home state of Florida, and around the rest of the country. While touring a lot of the country, my band and I would be hundreds of miles from home and would end up booking with promoters that just didn't show up, only paid us 10 bucks (way less than what we agreed on, without reasonable cause) or just didn't pay us at all.</p>
<p>Being a DIY touring band and even being on a small label, you can get ripped off easily by many people. I'd like to flip the table on that, and help as many bands as possible before they get on the road. Showing them through this service, what people to trust and who to avoid. I wish I had something similar while touring, and I don't think it's fair that if you're not a huge agent with a thousand super trust worthy contacts, that you should just blindly book with strangers. The service will provide a similar atmosphere to Yelp, reviewing promoters based on past experiences and if they are poorly reviewed by a majority of users, we will recommend you booking with someone else to save time and frustration.</p>
<p>With these contributions, they will go straight to the start up costs to this idea. It will take a website design, app design and production, as well as server storage and space to run such a big idea.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am going to keep the indiegogo simple, if everyone can contribute just five dollars, we will put your name on the website as a big THANK YOU for helping out musicians everywhere.</p>

<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>Like Yelp, this could help weed out the great from the not so great. If you are new to touring and don't want to just place all your bets on booking with someone who <i>could</i> be trustworthy, then this service can show you who is actually worth booking with.</p>
<p>This could help bands EVERYWHERE, regardless of the size of the band. Bands nowadays have it hard enough as it is, we need to give power back to the artist in anyway we can, and I hope to accomplish that by doing this.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge is creating enough start up capital to make this a reality, making a large website and app that can hold so many users isn't cheap, but your five dollars can go a long way in making this a reality. If we don't meet our goal- you will be refunded completely.</p>

They have 14 branches throughout CA, AZ, and NV housing homeless veterans and helping our vets become stable and independent again.Please take a look at our campaign video… We’ve had the honor of hearing what these knowledgeable and experience physicians, nurses and patients have to say about the health benefits of medical cannabis. When we reach our goal our vision is to create a modern version of the “Heal The World” music video by Michael Jackson which helped bring awareness to world hunger. Our music video will spread a message about the health benefits of medical cannabis.Oh annnnddd below, we have some great perks for your donations.  Check it out!We are deeply thankful for your support for this amazing cause. We want our song to break the stigma attached to cannabis that causes fear and misunderstanding and its labeling as a destructive drug so that it can be used freely to help our suffering veterans.Here’s to living our lives to the fullest with happy bodies and hearts, cheers!~ Jelly Bread and Whitton",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>On the 12th July, the Portland State Chamber Choir arrived in Singapore on their way to Bali. They sang spontaneously at Changi Airport. Since then their video has been viewed more than 100,000 times after it was reported on mothership, a Singapore blog site.<br/><br/>Well, the tamil song sung was a popular hit with the Indian community here in Singapore. </p>
<p>I think the people in Singapore would love to hear the group sing live in a hall. It is also a celebration of friendship, international cross-cultural exchange and music. <a href=""http://mothership.sg/2017/07/u-s-choral-group-spontaneously-performs-acclaimed-tamil-song-at-changi-airport-transit-area/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://mothership.sg/2017/07/u-s-choral-group-s...</a><br/><br/>The choir comes in to Singapore on the 22nd July at  345p.m. They can perform in the evening at 8p.m of the 22nd July, Saturday.<br/><br/>As the time to organise this is short, we welcome and appreciate any and all help to spread this ASAP.

<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p><span>Seattle-based Bucharest Drinking Team is more that just a Balkan inspired band. At our shows and Pop-Up Kafanas, we bring you on a whirlwind trip through the Balkans with pop songs from old radios and cartoon theme songs; from wedding brass bands in dusty streets to smoky back rooms with old fiddlers getting down.</span></p>
<p>Though we are a group of mostly American-born people, we have grown to love the music and culture of the Balkans through family, friendships, travel, study, work, and activism. There is amazing music, dancing, and a wonderful culture of hospitality that spans southeastern Europe, a region where the Ottoman Empire once clashed with the Austro-Hungarians. We on the Bucharest Drinking Team take our inspiration from this great hospitality, which many of us have experienced first hand, and for you, we craft an experience that involves the sounds, sights, smells, and tastes to capture the essence of Kafana culture.</p>
<p>Our Pop-Up Kafana album starts with us recording everything we do for a year: our rehearsals, our shows, our practices and after-parties, stories of joy and songs of heartache. With these ingredients, we will distil the year of recordings into a 45 minute package of the finest of our fine moments. We hope that when all is said and done, we can raise a glass and toast each other and you to carry on toward another day. We throw these parties for you, because of you; otherwise it would just be practice.</p>
