<p><b>We have spent the last year working on an EP entitled ""Boys &amp; Girls"".  The album art and recorded music aspects are in their final steps, and one music video has been completed, but we have one last visual portion to create.  A live performance + music video mash up that features the entire album! In other words, a visual album (think LEMONADE), but with a live performance being the main attraction.</b></p>

<p>So, this is what we need and what you will be helping us get! :)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Rental of Venue</b> - We will be shooting the live performance portion of the video at The Clock Factory in Berkeley, CA and will need to rent it for 2 days.</li>
<li>
<b>Engineer, Producer and Rental of Recording Equipment</b>- The live recordings are just as important as the visual components of this video. So we will have to rent recording equipment as well as hire an engineer to record it and a producer to create the final version of the live recordings.</li>
<li>
<b>Film Crew</b>- This includes directors, director of photography, producers, art director, set director, camera operators and assistants, production sound mixer, lighting technician, key grip, wardrobe/stylist, make-up artist, hair stylist, actors, and editor.  We will need all of these people for <b>two</b> different shoots.  First the live performance shoot and then the storyline shoot. </li>
<li>
<b>Set Production</b> - Both portions of the Video will need to have set designs; this includes painting, projections, space rentals and car rental (for storyline portion) and props.</li>

<h3>Eventhough things are hard in Greece we decided that we are going to continue making this CD. We thank all the contributors and we are going to send them their perks as we promised. They will hear from us soon. Art can keep us alive and happy. <br/>

<h3>Things are difficult for artists in Greece</h3>
<p>I am Apostolis Armagos. A new composer who lives in Athens-Greece. I have composed some new songs and I am trying to create my third cd. Markos Kritikos wrote the lyrics. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I am very lucky to have a really great male voice for my project, Nikos Venetakis. Nikos is from the beautiful island of Crete and his voice is totally original. When I listen to him, I travel to the island. I want to use traditional Greek musical instruments. My songs are based on traditional Greek music. You might call it ethnic or folk.</span><br/></p>
<p>We have started some recordings in a small studio in the center of Athens, near the Acropolis, and we hope that the recordings will finish in September. Although the musicians that participate are friends, I believe that they must be payed. We also have to pay the studio, the sound engineer and of course the production of the discs.</p>

<h3>Things are very hard in Greece now, because of the crisis, and musicians that record their music have to pay everything by themselves.</h3>
<div>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">If I collect 5.000 euros I will manage to pay my studio, musicians and a part of the disc production. If I collect less, i will pay... a part of all those. </span><br/>
</div>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
<h3>
<strong>I am really excited about this 10 songs </strong>album.</h3> <p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">All of my friends believe that, if finished, this will be a really good Cd. And I believe it too. I also think it will be very interesting for non Greek people, because it uses Greek instruments: lute, cretan lyra, bouzouki, greek percussion, etc. And Nikos Venetakis is a really great vocalist. You must meet him. </span><br/></p>

<h3><strong>Γεια σας!</strong></h3>Ονομάζομαι Αποστόλης Αρμάγος. Είμαι συνθέτης και τραγουδοποιός και αυτήν την περίοδο προσπαθώ να ηχογραφήσω το τρίτο μου CD. Πρόκειται για έναν δίσκο που θα περιλαμβάνει δέκα τραγούδια σε μουσική δική μου και στίχους του συνεργάτη μου Μάρκου Κρητικού. Είμαι πολύ χαρούμενος που ερμηνευτής αυτών των κομματιών είναι ένα νέο παιδί, ο Νίκος Βενετάκης,  ο οποίος πιστεύω ότι μπορεί να πάει πολύ ψηλά.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Ο δίσκος έχει ύφος παραδοσιακό</h3>

Eventhough things are hard in Greece we decided that we are going to continue making this CD. We thank all the contributors and we are going to send them their perks as we promised. They will hear from us soon. Art can keep us alive and happy. 


DEAR FRIENDS
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT
*This campaign might restart again later this year.


Things are difficult for artists in Greece
I am Apostolis Armagos. A new composer who lives in Athens-Greece. I have composed some new songs and I am trying to create my third cd. Markos Kritikos wrote the lyrics. 
I am very lucky to have a really great male voice for my project, Nikos Venetakis. Nikos is from the beautiful island of Crete and his voice is totally original. When I listen to him, I travel to the island. I want to use traditional Greek musical instruments. My songs are based on traditional Greek music. You might call it ethnic or folk.
We have started some recordings in a small studio in the center of Athens, near the Acropolis, and we hope that the recordings will finish in September. Although the musicians that participate are friends, I believe that they must be payed. We also have to pay the studio, the sound engineer and of course the production of the discs.
  


   
Things are very hard in Greece now, because of the crisis, and musicians that record their music have to pay everything by themselves.

If I collect 5.000 euros I will manage to pay my studio, musicians and a part of the disc production. If I collect less, i will pay... a part of all those. 


    

I am really excited about this 10 songs album. All of my friends believe that, if finished, this will be a really good Cd. And I believe it too. I also think it will be very interesting for non Greek people, because it uses Greek instruments: lute, cretan lyra, bouzouki, greek percussion, etc. And Nikos Venetakis is a really great vocalist. You must meet him. 





For contributing to the album you will get some items
Ι must say that, even if you have very little to offer it is important for me. 


Thank you.

Γεια σας!Ονομάζομαι Αποστόλης Αρμάγος. Είμαι συνθέτης και τραγουδοποιός και αυτήν την περίοδο προσπαθώ να ηχογραφήσω το τρίτο μου CD. Πρόκειται για έναν δίσκο που θα περιλαμβάνει δέκα τραγούδια σε μουσική δική μου και στίχους του συνεργάτη μου Μάρκου Κρητικού. Είμαι πολύ χαρούμενος που ερμηνευτής αυτών των κομματιών είναι ένα νέο παιδί, ο Νίκος Βενετάκης,  ο οποίος πιστεύω ότι μπορεί να πάει πολύ ψηλά.



Ο δίσκος έχει ύφος παραδοσιακό
Αν σας αρέσει η παραδοσιακή μουσική και τα παραδοσιακά μουσικά όργανα πιστεύω ότι ο δίσκος αυτός μπορεί και να σας ενθουσιάσει. Λαούτα, κρητικές λύρες, νταούλια και μια φωνή γνήσια και αυθεντική, νομίζω ότι δημιουργούν ένα πολύ καλό αποτέλεσμα.

Όπως όλοι ξέρουμετα πράγματα στην Ελλάδα είναι πολύ δύσκολα αυτή την εποχή, για όλους. Εάν παρόλ' αυτά μπορείτε να συνεισφέρετε έστω και κάτι μικρό, για μας είναι πολύ σημαντικό. Είμαι από αυτούς που πιστεύουν ότι στα δύσκολα η τέχνη μπορεί να βοηθήσει τον καθένα μας να αισθανθεί καλύτερα. Είναι μια πολύ καλή διέξοδος.


Τι θα λάβετε εάν βοηθήσετεΌπως θα δείτε και στο πλάι της σελίδας, εάν συνεισφέρετε στην προσπάθειά μας θα λάβετε κάποια δώρα. 

- Με 2 ευρώ θα σας στείλουμε ψηφιακά 1 τραγούδι του δίσκου- Με 10 ευρώ θα σας στείλουμε ψηφιακά τα τραγούδια του δίσκου
- Με 30 ευρώ θα σας στείλουμε το δισκάκι
- Με 50 ευρώ θα σας στείλουμε ψηφιακά τα τραγούδια του δίσκου καθώς και ένα t-shirt είδικά σχεδιασμένο για την καμπάνια με σχέδια από ελληνικά μουσικά όργανα (κρητική λύρα, λαούτο κτλ.)
- Με 100 ευρώ θα σας στείλουμε το cd, το t-shirt καθώς και ένα πλεκτό χειροποίητο βραχιολάκι
- Με 200 ευρώ θα σας στείλουμε το cd καθώς και ένα κόσμημα-αντίγραφο του δίσκου της Φαιστού από ασήμι.

ΠΡΟΣΟΧΗ: η συνεισφορά μπορεί να είναι και διαφορετικό ποσό από τα παραπάνω. Κάθε ποσό είναι εύπρόσδεκτο, όσο μικρό κι αν είναι.


Ακόμα κι αν δεν μπορείτε να συνεισφέρετεδημοσιεύστε την καμπάνια μου στη σελίδα σας στο Fb ή στείλτε το σχετικό λινκ σε κάποιον που νομίζετε ότι μπορεί να ενδιαφέρεται, είναι κι αυτό πολύ σημαντικό.

<p>I am so thankful for
all my supporters from American Idol, and now it is time to give back with my first BIG
GIRL ALBUM! My first album was recorded and produced on my iPhone before I
appeared on Idol, but I know I can do better, so here I am. </p>
<p>Before my time on Idol, I was making a living as a street busker in New Orleans, which means I just made what I needed to survive. In order to produce the quality album that I want to produce, I need proper funding. Sadly, not the kind of money I would
find in a hat at the end of a shift. So, I am turning to you, my fans, my kiwis, to help me. </p>
<p>I checked around and
the costs are high, as you would imagine. With the help of some professionals in the industry, I have come up with a figure that will help me to produce and distribute the type of album I can be proud of, as well as hit the road and perform it live in as many of your cities as possible. </p>
<p>That being said, of course, I plan to give something back to you all for you wonderful donations. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">I have come up with a list of
gifts I can give to each of you for your support. If you don’t see anything you
like, let me know, and I will find something to send as a thank you!</span></p>
<p>This Big Girl Album is
for you, my kiwis. </p>
<p><b>What We Need</b></p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">I will need studio time, musicians, engineers, and producers. I will also need help with marketing, promotion, and distribution. I am
just one girl with an ever growing group of volunteers, but clearly I can't do this on my own. My hope is to get enough funding that enables me to produce an album I can be proud of, and to tour as many cities across the U.S. to perform my album and meet as many of you as I can.</span></p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>If you followed me on
American Idol, I looked a little starstruck in the beginning, and I still am. The day that my grandfather talked me into auditioning for American Idol, I never could have imagined that I would not only make it onto the show as a contestant, but that I would make it as far as I did. </p>
<p>Throughout the process, you all helped me believe in myself. I have a book coming out about my personal
journey, about all of the ups and downs. It wasn't easy! You made
me believe that dreams can come true, and that anything is possible. You have all given
me so much, and asked for so little in return. It is time for me to release my own album and come to your cities to perform it.</p>
<p>You
helped me get to a 7th place finish on American Idol, you sent me your love via social
media, and now I turn to you again.</p>
<p>So many people have
told me how I have touched and even changed their lives, just by being myself. I
knew I was weird and quirky before American Idol, but now I know I am not alone. Let’s take #teamKiwi to a new level!</p>
<p>I realize that I am asking a lot, but this is what it will take to
produce a high quality album, and a subsequent tour. I have carefully selected perks that I feel you guys would appreciate. Regardless of whether or not I reach my goal, I will ensure that each of you receives a token of my thanks. If I don't reach my goal, it
will just take a little longer, but this album WILL happen. Ideally, the album will be released in 2016, hopefully earlier than later.</p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>Social Media is a powerful tool, as I learned during my time on Idol, maybe even moreso afterwards. People all around the world have been contacting me and asking how they can help. This campaign is your chance. Kiwi Nation is growing, and social media assistance is just as important. I need to you guys to spread the word. Use the Indiegogo
share tools, retweet on twitter, repost on Instagram, share on facebook, and any other platforms you can think of!

Je suis Olivier Bélisle. Pour ceux et celles qui ne me connaissent
pas, ça fait pas mal d'années que je joue de la musique dans
différents projets. J'ai lancé mon premier album en 2012. Depuis,
tu m'as peut-être vu au Quai des Brumes, au Divan Orange, aux
Francouvertes, au concours village en chanson de petite-Vallée, ou à
suer mes cordes de guitare avec le groupe Canailles ou au défunt
Pizza Madonna. Bref, je ne suis pas que ça mais beaucoup.
Maintenant, 2015, le temps est venu d'enregistrer mon prochain disque
mais pour l'instant je n'ai aucun financement quelconque pour
produire cette chose, cette précieuse chose...</p>
<p>Le
studio est réservé pour la fin août. Les gens avec qui je veux
travailler sont prêts. Les chansons sont prêtes. Ça s'enligne pour
un bel album avec de belles collaborations. Une sortie en novembre
prochain serait le plan. </p>
<p>Je
profite de cette approche de sociofinancement pour demander votre
aide à concrétiser ce projet! Je vous demande ici une somme de
5000$. Ce montant est environ la moitié de ce que j'ai réellement
besoin. Pourquoi je ne demande pas 10 000$ alors? Parce que 5000$
c'est déjà immensément gentil de votre part et j'ai fait des
demandes de subventions pour amasser le reste. On s'entend que
demander une bourse et/ou des subventions dans le domaine des arts,
avec le nombre de demandes qu'ils reçoivent, c'est ultra contingenté
et je ne peux me fier pas là-dessus. Dans le cas où le refus est
global au niveau de mes demandes de subventions, le 5000$ que vous
pourriez me donner va tout simplement sauver la vie de cet album! Ça
va faire la job en coupant par-ci par-là avec comme résultat final,
un album et du plaisir!</p>
<p>En
fait c'est comme une prévente d'album + d'autres surprises!</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432049731/bcvladmv15o7c0seodfo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><i>Crédit photo: Luca Pharand qui capte et vous montre comment Olivier écrit sur un banc d'auto.</i><br/>

</p><p><b>Donc
pour les contreparties en échange de votre participation</b>:</p>
<p>À
<b>20$</b> de votre part, je vous donne l'album lors du lancement qui aura
lieu en novembre. À venir chercher lors du lancement ou bien il vous
sera envoyé par la poste.</p>
<p>À

<p>À

global au niveau de mes demandes de subventions, le 5000$ que vous
pourriez me donner va tout simplement sauver la vie de cet album! Ça
va faire la job en coupant par-ci par-là avec comme résultat final,
un album et du plaisir!
En
fait c'est comme une prévente d'album + d'autres surprises!Crédit photo: Luca Pharand qui capte et vous montre comment Olivier écrit sur un banc d'auto.

Donc
pour les contreparties en échange de votre participation:
À
20$ de votre part, je vous donne l'album lors du lancement qui aura
lieu en novembre. À venir chercher lors du lancement ou bien il vous
sera envoyé par la poste.
À
40$ de votre part, je vous donne l'album lors du lancement (ou par la
poste) et vous allez participer à un concert en solo gratuit dans un
endroit inusité de Montréal. Vous aurez les détails une semaine
avant via votre courriel.
À
200$ et plus de votre part, je vous donne tout ce qui est énuméré
au-dessus (album + concert surprise) + je vous invite bien
cordialement chez moi. Je prépare ma meilleure recette de
(chuuuut....) et un beau jam durant le reste de la soirée. C'est
quand même assez spectaculaire comme proposition! Concours de selfie
en chest en moins.

Donc
merci à l'avance! Bien hâte à tout ça! Ça va faire du bien des
sortir ces tounes là! 
Merci

<p>Since 2008, the band evolves in a dark and dancing
universe. Gloomy and melodic at the same time, the power of the songs comes
with a dreary atmosphere and distorted beats, all of this cradled by the voice
of Julien Kidam, sometimes aggressive, sometimes quiet but always angry and
obscure.</p>
<p>After their first album Tears Of Pain in 2011, the
german label Danse Macabre released Broken Wings in 2012. In this second album,
the electro is violently merging with sounds close to the guitars riffs all
along the 13 songs of an industrial dark electro rock. Each of these albums
were followed by some free digital remixes albums.</p>
<p>The band really expresses itself with energetic shows
on stage and is proud, with 7 years of existence, to have shared the stage with
bands such as Hocico, The Young Gods, Punish Yourself, Tamtrum, and soon (in January) withTyske
Ludder. </p>
<p>CSK has recently been endorsed by the brand Hyraw
clothing and can't wait to share this new opus with you!</p>

<b><h3>Histoire du groupe</h3></b>Depuis 2008, le groupe évolue dans un univers sombre, énergique et 
dansant. Á la fois sinistre et mélodique, la puissance des morceaux 
s’imprègne d’une ambiance ténébreuse aux beats saturés, bercée par la 
voix de Julien Kidam, tantôt agressive, tantôt posée, mais toujours 
obscure et furieuse.<br/><br/><p>Après leur premier album Tears Of Pain en 2011, Broken Wings sort sur
 le label allemand Danse Macabre en 2012. Dans ce deuxième album, 
l’électronique s’accouple avec violence à des sonorités proches des 
riffs de guitares au cours de 13 plages d’un rock industriel 
délicieusement dark. Chacun de ces deux opus a été suivi par un album de
 remixes proposé en téléchargement libre.<br/></p>
<p>Mais c’est sur scène à travers un show des plus énergique que le 
groupe s’exprime réellement. Fort de ses 7 ans d'existence et fier d'avoir pu partager l'affiche avec des groupes tels que Hocico, The Young Gods, Punish Yourself, Tamtrum et bientôt (en janvier) Tyske Ludder.<br/></p><p>CSK a récemment été endorsé par la

After their first album Tears Of Pain in 2011, the
german label Danse Macabre released Broken Wings in 2012. In this second album,
the electro is violently merging with sounds close to the guitars riffs all
along the 13 songs of an industrial dark electro rock. Each of these albums
were followed by some free digital remixes albums.
The band really expresses itself with energetic shows
on stage and is proud, with 7 years of existence, to have shared the stage with
bands such as Hocico, The Young Gods, Punish Yourself, Tamtrum, and soon (in January) withTyske
Ludder. 
CSK has recently been endorsed by the brand Hyraw
clothing and can't wait to share this new opus with you!

Voilà déjà quelques temps que
nous en parlions et nous y sommes enfin… Notre troisième album ""The Speed of
Time"" est finalement prêt ! Comme vous l’avez probablement deviné, il
traitera du temps qui passe, des sentiments et regrets que nous pouvons
ressentir face à lui. Mais ce qui le démarque des précédents albums est que
nous avons décidé d’ajouter de la guitare sur presque tous les morceaux. Alors tenez-vous prêts pour un moment musical bien plus industriel et
rock’n’roll !

Histoire du groupeDepuis 2008, le groupe évolue dans un univers sombre, énergique et 
dansant. Á la fois sinistre et mélodique, la puissance des morceaux 
s’imprègne d’une ambiance ténébreuse aux beats saturés, bercée par la 
voix de Julien Kidam, tantôt agressive, tantôt posée, mais toujours 
obscure et furieuse.Après leur premier album Tears Of Pain en 2011, Broken Wings sort sur
 le label allemand Danse Macabre en 2012. Dans ce deuxième album, 
l’électronique s’accouple avec violence à des sonorités proches des 
riffs de guitares au cours de 13 plages d’un rock industriel 
délicieusement dark. Chacun de ces deux opus a été suivi par un album de
 remixes proposé en téléchargement libre.
Mais c’est sur scène à travers un show des plus énergique que le 
groupe s’exprime réellement. Fort de ses 7 ans d'existence et fier d'avoir pu partager l'affiche avec des groupes tels que Hocico, The Young Gods, Punish Yourself, Tamtrum et bientôt (en janvier) Tyske Ludder.CSK a récemment été endorsé par la

This ended abruptly when the national Radio Slovenia unlawfully terminated my contract and consequentially cancelled the show in the summer of 2013. The lawsuit followed and I've been fighting to bring the show back for two years now. My attorney and the Union of Journalists believe that I stand a good chance, but I now need your help to finally make this happen.</p>

</div><div> <p>I've been unemployed for two years now and I cannot afford to pay the fees of my attorney any longer. With that, the show will be over for good and there will be no chance of winning. The problem is that I specialized in electronic music and fully devoted the last decade of my career to it based on the contract with the national Radio Slovenia. This was never supposed to be terminated and my work experience as a result of a decade of full-time work for the RTVS became so specific that I am now unable to find a job anywhere else. I tried at the commercial radios in Slovenia, but they show no appreciation for the less commercial genres of electronic music and were not interested in any kind of cooperation.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Without your help, the show will never be broadcasted again. With your help, we can make it happen  - there is a chance to get it back on air and offer you the best new sounds and the best works of Slovenian and international producers again. We can have our show back if we just stand together and make a clear statement that this means something to us! It is easy to become discouraged, but even 1 Euro donations can make a difference at this point, I promise you that.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>As with every lawsuit (or anything else in life for that matter) there are no guarantees. No one can 100% guarantee that we will win, but chances are good and I have a strong case well supported by evidence. I would have dropped the case long ago if this weren't so.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you cannot afford to donate, you can help by spreading the word about this campaign and make sure that as many people as possible hear about it. This too would be of great help and deeply appreciated.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for any kind of help and support.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary Dear all, as many of you know, my radio show Nova elektronika has been famous for bringing new sounds and voices of electronic music to the people of Slovenia every Friday for over a decade. This ended abruptly when the national Radio Slovenia unlawfully terminated my contract and consequentially cancelled the show in the summer of 2013. The lawsuit followed and I've been fighting to bring the show back for two years now. My attorney and the Union of Journalists believe that I stand a good chance, but I now need your help to finally make this happen.
V SLOVENŠČINI NAJDETE CELO ZGODBO TUKAJ: 
http://www.reporter.si/slovenija/mateja-klari%C4%8D-se-v-sodni-bitki-z-rtv-slovenija-ne-predaja/54305
IN TUKAJ
http://podcrto.si/odpuscena-honorarna-sodelavka-rtv-slovenija-z-mnozicnim-financiranjem-zbira-denar-za-odvetnika/
What We Need & What You Get
 I've been unemployed for two years now and I cannot afford to pay the fees of my attorney any longer. With that, the show will be over for good and there will be no chance of winning. The problem is that I specialized in electronic music and fully devoted the last decade of my career to it based on the contract with the national Radio Slovenia. This was never supposed to be terminated and my work experience as a result of a decade of full-time work for the RTVS became so specific that I am now unable to find a job anywhere else. I tried at the commercial radios in Slovenia, but they show no appreciation for the less commercial genres of electronic music and were not interested in any kind of cooperation.
    The Impact Without your help, the show will never be broadcasted again. With your help, we can make it happen  - there is a chance to get it back on air and offer you the best new sounds and the best works of Slovenian and international producers again. We can have our show back if we just stand together and make a clear statement that this means something to us! It is easy to become discouraged, but even 1 Euro donations can make a difference at this point, I promise you that.
    Risks & Challenges As with every lawsuit (or anything else in life for that matter) there are no guarantees. No one can 100% guarantee that we will win, but chances are good and I have a strong case well supported by evidence. I would have dropped the case long ago if this weren't so.
    Other Ways You Can Help If you cannot afford to donate, you can help by spreading the word about this campaign and make sure that as many people as possible hear about it. This too would be of great help and deeply appreciated.
Thank you so much for any kind of help and support.

<li><p><strong>Music found me</strong> at the age of 22 with a little ukulele and a lot of words; it's been wild.  God has brought some incredible opportunities to my fingertips; especially since making leaps out of my comfort zone...to MUSIC CITY.  I got a manager and a publishing deal..having a team has helped me so, so much...  <strong>Now </strong>I have the opportunity to work with an <strong>amazing production</strong> <strong>team,</strong> that I could have only dreamed about before. I didn't realize how important production was until I worked with my different people and styles and realized ...production is the music.  So, this opportunity is everything for me.  This man is the best of the best; I feel in my heart of hearts that he is the one I am supposed to work with. His humility, kindness, and down- to- earth-ness is stunning. The way that we came together is destiny. <i>The only thing between me and this opportunity is some </i><strong style=""font-style: italic;"">money. $$</strong><i>  (although I already signed the deal...so the money will have to come some way or another lol) </i></p></li>
<li>My manager and I have been presented with some opportunities to team up with some incredible giants in the industry next year.  We are definitely scoping those out and considering every opportunity.  My goal right now is to see how far we can get this project while being independent.  I know you guys can help me take my music to the next level.  If I have at least 200 people who believe in me...then game on.</li>
<li><strong>I have experienced the power of music. I also know that it's critical to hold onto my power in my own music (prince says so), until the right team comes along to support the vision.  </strong></li>

(insert Uncle Sam poster)</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What I need + What you get</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>let me break it down: </p>
<p><b>It costs 10K+ to produce and release one song with a producer at this level. </b> My goal is to do 4 songs.  The money pays for the production, the band, the mixing, mastering, and marketing.  There are so many people involved to get one song out effectively.  I work in a restaurant and every bit of money I have goes towards food, rent, and music.  It's def been worth it to live in Nashville and have to work my butt off in this industry, I have so much more drive and respect now.  You really cant put a price on the years of heart and soul this team has put into their craft.</p>
<p><strong>PERKS: you get to be my current label. The fuel to make the dream work. Partners in this God-dream of mine.  You get my gratitude...I can't do it without you. (unless I get picked up by a label :)</strong></p>
<ul><li>If I don't reach my entire goal, I will do as many songs and marketing that the funds will allow.</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Lets Make An Impact</h3>
<p>I know each of you have been touched by music.  It has the power to bring us together.  Music is one of the biggest ways I connect with people, connect with God, process my feelings, understand others, and the world around me. My gift came to me from above and I want to give it back to the world, to you, to as many people as I can. I've had lots of people reach out with stories of how my music has helped them through breaks ups, divorces, hard times, family issues....that is what keeps me going in this business.. through the ups and downs....more than anything. It's my passion, it's my purpose.  The opportunity I've been presented with blows my mind, I tear up when I talk about it.  I'm overflowing with gratitude. </p>
<ul><li>I have had (very) mild success with campaigns like this, because I didn't have a plan of action, nor the songs, nor the maturity in my craft that I now have.  This project has the potential to take me to another level.  But I need you. </li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>RISK it for the biscuit.</h3>
<p>Pursuing music is a risk.  Especially as an indie artist.  I can't imagine doing anything else.   The reason I believe this project is a financial risk worth taking is because<strong> I'm ready.</strong>  I've prepared.  I've developed a strong sense of self as writer, a singer, and as an artist.  I am more confident than ever..I've stood in front of greats and stood tall..(I used to have a panic attack when I had to be on stage..now it's home). I've built a team to help me with the creative and the business side of my project. <strong> I have a grammy winning producer who is willing to take a risk on me, who believes in me whole-heartedly. </strong>The bones are in place,  The heart beat is here.  Now it's time to make it dance, babyyy.  Will you help me make it dance?</p>

<h3>Who is Tall Boy Special?</h3>
<p>Glad you asked! We are three tall idiots who love to make people laugh.  We left our professional comedian jobs in Boston in late 2019 to try our hand at making it in LA. Then the world shut down. We spent our newfound excess of down time jamming by pools and drinking tall beers. Tall Boy Special was born out of a deep desire for creative output in a world that needed it most. We're very serious about our silly output. In the past year we've released two albums, <i>Really Actually Beautiful</i> and <i>Monster Music, </i>as well as four singles ""Open Mic Night at the Chuckle Barn"", ""Hot Tub Hot Air Balloon"", ""Normal Day"" and ""Fictional Aisle"", the latter of which blew up on Tik Tok and was featured on CBS' Funniest #atHome Videos hosted by Cedric the Entertainer. All of our music has been written, recorded and produced by us.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where's My Money Going?</h3>
<p>Great question, you want to get right to the point. While we've enjoyed our makeshift bedroom recording set up, we're ready for our art to reflect our professionalism. Our newest ideas are bigger than ever before and we're not equipped to realize them on our own. Your contributions will help us get into a proper studio to get our new music out to the world! In addition to studio time and post-production costs, your contributions will go towards hiring other creatives to aid in the realization of the project. Such artists will include session musicians, graphic designers, photographers and videographers. So really, your donation will be assisting a number of people.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why can't you just record your music from your bedroom like you did before?</h3>
<p>Okay. Fair question, but geeze. In recent months we've experienced some difficulties as a band for the best possible reasons. Johnny Mac just welcomed his beautiful baby girl Sophie into the world. He has relocated to MA and we are so proud and happy for him. And don't get it twisted, while we're all very busy on opposite coasts we still meet via FaceTime a few times a week to write songs. We've got a backlog of great new material and with your help we can all be in one place to make this music the proper way. And Zack and Alex get to meet Sophie. If you don't contribute you are barring Zack and Alex from meeting baby Sophie. C'mon.</p>

<h3>Can't Contribute?</h3>
<p>No Problem! All we ask is that you check out our music on Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon, YouTube, etc, anywhere music is found. If you like it, tell a friend about it! </p>

<p>We started working on our online radio station <strong>(<a href=""http://www.rababa.fm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.rababa.fm</a>)</strong> since 2013, We have invested so much effort and money to the point where we couldn't do it on our own anymore, and our dream was to expand our idea, that's when a friend of ours suggested Indiegogo.</p>
<p>rababa.fm is made FOR people like you and me, we stream songs with profound meanings, songs that relate to our daily lives, songs that make us happy, simply great songs!</p>

<p>Our dream is to expand to the new radio experience and services mentioned earlier,We are now trying to raise <strong>$12500</strong> to open an office, to setup a team and get some bright minded individuals to work with me to get my idea come true. The most important thing for us is to redefine radio broadcasting, and offer the extra services for startups and small businesses from all over the world.</p>
<p>By successfully funding our campaign and reach the <strong>$12500</strong> goal, you will generously be able to help us by:</p>
<ul>

rababa.fm
Our names are Yasmin & Mo Khalaf, we are living in Amman, Jordan. We both have been in love with radio and music ever since we can remember, in fact, one of the best things we have in common is music. Join us in creating something special, as we share our story about how we aim to redefine your radio listening experience.
We started working on our online radio station (www.rababa.fm) since 2013, We have invested so much effort and money to the point where we couldn't do it on our own anymore, and our dream was to expand our idea, that's when a friend of ours suggested Indiegogo.
rababa.fm is made FOR people like you and me, we stream songs with profound meanings, songs that relate to our daily lives, songs that make us happy, simply great songs!
We are your go to radio station when you feel you need that motivation, positiveness and uplifting. We are live 24/7, you can listen to our English songs all day long from our website www.rababa.fm, and soon from our App for iOS and Android.
To us, most radio stations operate the same, talk shows that don't interest the majority, filled with commercials and just playing new music, well we want to offer you a better radio experience, because people are forgetting how fun and amazing radio stations are, we will also be offering other services such as retail radio services and commercials production for startups and small businesses.
Our dream is to expand to the new radio experience and services mentioned earlier,We are now trying to raise $12500 to open an office, to setup a team and get some bright minded individuals to work with me to get my idea come true. The most important thing for us is to redefine radio broadcasting, and offer the extra services for startups and small businesses from all over the world.
By successfully funding our campaign and reach the $12500 goal, you will generously be able to help us by:

Renting an office, with internet, which will cost me approximately $3500. 
Developing an App. Cost = $2500.
Setup equipment and production hardware and software. Cost = $1700.
Hiring, marketing and advertising my expanded business. Cost = $3800.

Creative productions such as voice overs and others. Cost = $1000.

Start operation and growth plan.

The goal is to start offering our services on the cheap, startups and small businesses can avoid hefty studio charges when they create their commercials with us, we can also compete strongly in retail radio services, as we can use my experience in setting up an online radio station in a very cost effective manner.
The ultimate goal is for us to succeed, and save up capital to do the following step by step:

Buying a local radio frequency and opening a radio station.
Opening a music school.
Opening an instruments shop.
All the above to operate under one umbrella.

You may call us dreamers, or see this as unrealistic, but they are our dream one day we will make them a reality, a promise we made to ourselves, and we will never give up on it.
With your help, We are confident that we will offer the market something different, something special that will gain the appreciation of all music enthusiasts and artists alike.
We'd be grateful for your consideration to invest in our idea, in return, you will be getting a better way to be entertained while staying happy and positive all the time, thanks to the music selection we are going to be broadcasting.

<h3><strong>Update</strong></h3>
<p>November 8 is fast approaching, and it appears that funding for this song will not meet its goal ahead of the final days when Puget Sound regional citizens are deciding whether to accept or reject the $54 billion, 25-year ST3 tax proposition.  The song’s producers – educators and explainers first, business savants second! – have decided  to release the finished song <strong>now </strong>to support the public interest in trying to prevent a train wreck, or at least make sure that those aboard the train are fully informed!</p>
<p>The full song/video is now available publicly at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQgsb_bs84Zb4tOeU-_gzQg"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>TRAINWRECK.VIDEO</strong></a></p>

<h3><i>""There's something brewin' 'round the Sound""</i></h3>
<p>... and it ain’t coffee! </p>
<p>The Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue-Everett region will soon be voting on the ST3 rail expansion plan (also called Regional Proposition One).  In presenting the ST3 plan to the public, the transportation agency proposing it (Sound Transit) for the past year has flooded the media with seemingly irrefutable wonderfulness and benefits.  Sharp eyes soon took a closer look and discovered serious concerns that weren’t evident at first glance.</p>
<p>To support the $54 billion in expenditure, the amount of tax money to be collected exceeds the officially claimed $36 billion because of construction bonds that will require repayment decades beyond the 25 years of construction.  </p>
<p>Beyond this and other financial concerns, there are also substantial underlying issues of actual service delivered, which go beyond the surface appearance of “faster and nicer” and are (understandably) not apparent to frustrated travelers who just want things to get better. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Lopsided funding for a serious debate</h3>
<p>A pro-ST3 campaign organization called <b>Mass Transit Now</b> recently began operations with a paid staff supported by organizational contributions amounting to over $2.5 million as of early September.</p>
<p>A few robust “opposition” websites have been established, but their visibility can't compete with the TV and print ads generously funded by millions of dollars in contributions from big design, construction, and sports organizations that would benefit from the expanded system.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Citizens are now starting to hear the rumblings of concern, and the time is right to grab that awareness and put some more attention-getting and trustworthy “meat” on those bones of concern.</p>

<h3><b>Grabbing attention in a fun, accessible way</b></h3>

<p>We believe that <b>SEATTLE TRAIN WRECK</b> will be an unexpected and engaging way to harness the power of social media (in this case, YouTube) to catch the attention of our unsuspecting taxpayers in order to reveal some surprises that will <b><i>directly affect their pocketbook and their transportation experience, whether they use public transit or not.</i></b></p>

<p><strong>Vaishnavi </strong>has spent time un-learning with Rajeswar Bhattacharya and deepening into authentic sound with Chloe Goodchild. She encountered mantra through Kundalini Yoga and was introduced to bhajan and the bhakti path through meeting Amma. She considers this her greatest “teaching” – a flowering of the heart. For three years, she chanted the Lalita Sahasranama daily and led bhajans in a large Indian ashram.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>""She sings like an angel, touching hearts at a deep devotional level.""</strong></i> <strong>Chloe Goodchild</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Vaishnavi: ""I always longed to sing but shyness and terror overwhelmed me. On a TEFL training in 1997, when asked to teach a simple nursery rhyme to 5 people, my face beetrooted, my throat constricted and I could barely squeeze a sound out. In that mortifying moment, I realised: ""This has to change!"" It was the beginning of a long, arduous and utterly graced journey of ""finding my voice”. From beginning to sound mantra in a group through my Kundalini Yoga teacher training in 2001, I was introduced to bhajan through meeting Amma in 2005. After 2 months singing nightly at San Ramon ashram, I had a startling breakthrough. I think that was the day I began to understand that what comes through when I sing is so much greater than me. My main learning continues to be to get out of the way and my prayer is always for my voice to be a channel for love. It is with that intention that I embark on bringing forth harmonious mantras with Amy: to transmit the healing vibration of love and transport you on its wings!""</i></p>
<p><strong>​Amy</strong> continues to  witness in herself and others how the power of mantra and sound healing can carry us back into a state of surrender and grace, allowing our lives to unfold organically and our souls to guide us. Amy's passion for mantra and sound healing was ignited when she first discovered Kundalini Yoga in 2000 - around the same time she met Vaishnavi. Amy and Vaishnavi created 'Earth' in 2012, they came to understand that they share their music as a bridge to the Divine more than as a “performance”. </p>
<p><i>Amy: ""The idea of creating this album stirs up immense joy and love in my heart. I feel like it is a beginning, a birthing, a letting go and a sweet surrender into trust. It represents a flowering of my heart; a gesture that my soul is ready to receive and share. I have swam through fears, doubts, and a sea of insecurities regarding my creativity but now see these doubts as friends rather than enemies, as teachers rather than interrogators: they are there to awaken the best possible version of Myself - God's dream. My soul flourishes when I am singing, writing, sharing, loving, creating, when I am just being myself! So I pray that not only will our music radiate healing and devotion but will also inspire a rejoicing of each other’s gifts, joy, success and creative outlets.""</i></p>
<p><strong>Our Producer</strong>: We have a magical producer who loves our sound and has offered an amazing recording/mixing/mastering deal. Marc JB from Velvet Jam studios is a successful dance music producer and is moving into creating music more consciously imbued to uplift: JAM stands for Joy in Audio Manifest. What a delight it is for us to record in the depths of a leafy garden with someone coming from the intention! </p>

​Amy continues to  witness in herself and others how the power of mantra and sound healing can carry us back into a state of surrender and grace, allowing our lives to unfold organically and our souls to guide us. Amy's passion for mantra and sound healing was ignited when she first discovered Kundalini Yoga in 2000 - around the same time she met Vaishnavi. Amy and Vaishnavi created 'Earth' in 2012, they came to understand that they share their music as a bridge to the Divine more than as a “performance”. 
Amy: ""The idea of creating this album stirs up immense joy and love in my heart. I feel like it is a beginning, a birthing, a letting go and a sweet surrender into trust. It represents a flowering of my heart; a gesture that my soul is ready to receive and share. I have swam through fears, doubts, and a sea of insecurities regarding my creativity but now see these doubts as friends rather than enemies, as teachers rather than interrogators: they are there to awaken the best possible version of Myself - God's dream. My soul flourishes when I am singing, writing, sharing, loving, creating, when I am just being myself! So I pray that not only will our music radiate healing and devotion but will also inspire a rejoicing of each other’s gifts, joy, success and creative outlets.""
Our Producer: We have a magical producer who loves our sound and has offered an amazing recording/mixing/mastering deal. Marc JB from Velvet Jam studios is a successful dance music producer and is moving into creating music more consciously imbued to uplift: JAM stands for Joy in Audio Manifest. What a delight it is for us to record in the depths of a leafy garden with someone coming from the intention! 
Budget: With recording, producing and distribution, this musical creation is only going to cost around £4000! Here are the break down of costs....
Recording/mixing/mastering/musicians -£2500CD Production - £1000Digital distribution, Indiegogo fees & Contingency - £456.67
If we make over the amount, this will go directly towards the making of our second Kundalini Yoga Mantra album - the songs are ready to go!
To have the opportunity and privilege to record and share these offerings is a blessing for us. We deeply appreciate any donation, however small, and hope in return we can inspire, uplift and console through this creation. With nothing but gratitude we open the invitation for you to be a part of this creation. If you cannot contribute with a donation you can still be a part of this by sharing and spreading the word:

<h3>Overdue Confession II - The Full Length EP</h3>
<p>Overdue Confession II - The Full Length LP </p>
<p>Hi there! My name is Sam Jones and I was born to make music.</p>
<p>My band and I, Sam C. Jones &amp; the Sinners recorded our first EP together last fall. ""Overdue Confession"" is a sweeping tour through the Americana landscape, with everything from blazing guitar solos to ballads about lost love and the sea. The songs are a mix of blues driven break-up tales, upbeat rockabilly and slowed down folk ballads. I am incredibly proud of the work we put into recording that EP, the stories behind the songs and the overwhelming response from our fans. If you like the songwriting styles of Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson and the musicality of Jason Isbell and Elvis Presley, my music is just for you!</p>
<p>So, here's the deal: <strong>we have six more songs we would like to record this year and we need your help.</strong>  Once we record these songs, we'll combine the new tunes with the OG ""Overdue Confession"" EP to release our first full-length album. The thing is, recording an album is <strong>expensive</strong>, even when you have a record label backing you; which, I do not. I am an independent musician, so all of the money to make this album happen comes from me (and hopefully you). The money from this campaign will go towards everything I need to make this album happen: paying my band and our recording engineers, paying the album photographer and poster designer, marketing and PR, paying to make, print and send y'all the rewards for this campaign.</p>
<p>These new songs are straight from the heart and hit you right in the soul. I have big dreams to tell these stories in the biggest way possible - and you can make that dream a reality! </p>
<p>No donation is too small - that being said, no donation is too big. We have some excellent reward tiers, ranging from physical copies of the new LP all the way to a live, in person show in your home.  Check them out!</p>
<p>Oh, and a thousand thank you's in advance for your help making this project happen. </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Since my manager and I are a two-person operation, it will take some time to get everything put together to mail out to you. We hope that the rewards will be mailed out to you sooner than the dates listed, but with me being in D.C. and my manager being in Nashville there is an additional step to this coordination process since things that need to be signed have to come to me, and then go to her! My manager is the most organized person I know (that's why she's my manager), so everything will probably be ready to go in August, but we want to give ourselves as much time as possible, while staying within reason.</p>
<p>Recording an album also takes time! Mixing and mastering takes time! God-willing everything will go right the first time around, but sometimes things have to be re-recorded or added in or tweaked after we're done in the studio. This album's release date is planned to give everyone as much time to make it perfect as we can.</p>

<h3>About the ""Where We Find Ourselves"" Virtual Choir</h3>
<p>Hello! I’m composer Michael Bussewitz-Quarm. I write choral music that engages singers and audiences with the leading social issues of our time. I’d love for you to join me in a virtual choir for my latest piece, Where We Find Ourselves.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1604968411/ftbfzizndca8a30jpmc1.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Where We Find Ourselves is inspired by an exhibit and book of the same name, which feature the portraits of Hugh Mangum, a photographer who lived in Durham, North Carolina during the Jim Crow era. He is unique in that he photographed people of diverse racial and economic backgrounds and was incredibly sensitive to the details in the portraits: the clothing, hair, expression, and physicality he captured truly represent humanity’s richness. It is significant that his work reflects racial diversity during a time of violent segregation. As Margaret Sartor, on of the curators and authors of the book, Where We Find Ourselves, observes, his portraits “indicate that an unbiased and open-door policy existed in his studio.”</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1604968434/bhuz8hh3ntntg9iqbzrp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>These portraits are from a set of glass plate negatives that were found years after Mangum’s death in a family barn. Over time, these negatives were damaged and so the photographs developed signs of wear and some distortions—all of which add to the richness of experiencing them as we consider the passage of time and the gaps between what we think we know about a person based on their appearance and who they truly are.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1604968516/slxg8mwrntflqvlu8pmc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This project begins with a series of video “journeys” that explore the themes in the portraits, the history of this era, and the music and lyrics as they are being written. These journeys will be hosted by me, lyricist Chantal Sellers, photographers, curators, and authors of the book Where We Find Ourselves, Margaret Sartor and Alex Harris, as well as Dr. Sherry Boyd, Humanities Coordinator for Dallas College, and Tina Sayers, Executive Director of Maple Seed Creative Consulting.</p>

<p>All virtual choir members will be invited to join a private Facebook group hosted by me so that you can meet one another, share your thoughts and observations, and build community with your fellow singers. In this way, we begin our artistic journey with introspection and discussion, to deepen our understanding and open our minds and hearts to the topics we will be singing about.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1604968646/blrlakzmlcyjsfgvfmef.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Where We Find Ourselves will be 20-22 minutes long, in five movements, for SATB choir.  The work will be of medium difficulty, with original lyrics written by Chantal Sellers. The music will be released in January, 2021, along with rehearsal tracks for you to use to practice and record your part. I will host recorded virtual “rehearsals” with each section to share my vision for phrasing, shaping, and overall musical ideas. These rehearsals will be recorded for those who will be preparing their part on their own. </p>
<p>In addition, you may join at the Premium Virtual Choir Member level and receive a one-on-one musical coaching with me. The final video will be edited together in the spring of 2021 and delivered to you and shared online so that the message can spread and grow!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The message of these photographs, that we must look and listen deeper to one another, and that while much time has passed, our country still has so much work to do to overcome racism, is timely and urgent. As we look around at our country and our world, it is easy to get overwhelmed by the many challenges we see. It’s important to know that we can make a difference by educating ourselves and using our talents to inform and inspire others.</p>
<p>In addition, many of us who have found a home in choral music are missing our usual outlet for singing during the pandemic. Our weekly rehearsal routine has been disrupted to keep our communities safe. But we still need community, we still need purpose and a way to channel our artistic talents for our own happiness and to serve others. This project will have an immense impact on our lives and on the world as we come together in the journeys this fall and in song in the spring.</p>
<p>I truly believe we can change the world through the power of music. Choral music is the perfect medium to raise awareness, engage ourselves and our community in dialogue, inspire compassion, and incite meaningful change. I hope you will open your hearts and raise your voice with me to create this new piece of music.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I am committed to writing this piece, hosting the video journeys, and creating the virtual choir video. I am an experienced composer and conductor with an extensive background in writing music, running rehearsals, and bringing a performance project to fruition. </p>
<p>One of the great things about a virtual choir is that it can work with a large, medium, or small group of singers. Because everyone will have access to the rehearsal tracks, I expect a high quality performance no matter the number of singers. I would love to have a large four-part chorus for this project, but the piece will work beautifully with a smaller ensemble if necessary. </p>
<p>If my financial goal is not reached, all commitments listed in the “perks” will be honored, the video journeys will go live, and the virtual choir video will still be created. In this way, I and my business are absorbing the risk of this project. There is no risk to donors. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I would love for you to raise your voice and sing with us, but I understand this may not be possible for everyone who supports the mission of this project.</p>
<p>You can help amplify the message of this piece by sharing this project with choral singers who do not have the opportunity to sing this season, or with choirs who are working to program their season.</p>

<h3><strong>Who We Are:</strong></h3>
<p><br/>We are Commie Faggots. You may know us by the name we had to use on Facebook - Communist Homosexuals - until we became the Band that are Banned on Facebook. This will be our third album and we think it's great and that you'll love listening to it (it unless you're Tory in which case you'll really hate it.)<br/><br/><strong>The Album</strong></p>
<p>We realised a while back that we had amassed several songs about politicians and political figures, and thought it would make sense to put them together in one album. As far as concept albums go, that's a pretty simple one eh?! Along with the humorous take downs of this gallery of deplorables are songs about the power seeking and conforming mindset more broadly (Normal), an anti-body shaming song about a penis that is Bent (Like A Politician), a song about a politician we actually approve of (no prizes for guessing who), and one to round off the album which points out the limitations of focusing on individuals rather than ideas and systems (Better Be Better).<br/><br/> </p>
<p><strong>    We'd love it if you fund this campaign because we believe:</strong><br/> </p>
<ul>
<li>Personality Politics will make you laugh lots, tap your feet, wiggle your bum and want to do it all over again several times</li>
<li>You'll get to listen to the whole album, rather than songs in isolation that you come across on Youtube or split up by ads on Spotify, who'd pay us about 0.001 p per listen</li>
<li>We love to play without charge  at fundraisers and benefit concerts for causes we believe in, and we love recording music and making videos. We can keep all the costs involved in this sustainable by having merch to sell</li>
<li>We printed our last album, Pinko, entirely from crowdfunding. Lots of people love that one, and if we can crowdfund this one, we're sure you'll love this one too!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our target</strong><br/><br/>We're setting a flexible target - the more we raise the more CDs we'll get printed.<br/>The price per unit goes waaaaay down if we reach £750, so that'd be nice, but less would still be cool - we can print smaller or bigger batches accordingly.<br/><br/><br/><strong>What you can give and what you can get!</strong><br/><br/>£5 - a download link to the album so you can listen digitally<br/>£10 - a CD copy of the album with full colour artwork<br/>£15 - the new CD plus a copy of our previous release, Pinko<br/>£20 - the new CD plus a t-shirt with the Commie Faggot logo</p>

<h2><strong>It’s Time!</strong></h2>
<p>Hey, Cloud People! We have heard your requests and are ready to get some music recorded for you. It is really important to us that we reflect Tucson in our sound, so we are looking for a local studio with whom to record. We also know that the live performances need some tweaking to get a better sound and we would love to continue to bring props and swag for our fan-mily (does that work? Fan + Family). Below is what are hoping to accomplish:</p>
<p><strong><u>Project Expense Breakdown (So why that amount?)</u></strong></p>
<p>First of all some good news, the campaign is a “Flexible” account which is different than ‘Kickstarter’ campaigns in the way that if we don’t make our target we still have access the amount raised. In a Kickstarter, if you don’t make the amount you lose it all.</p>
<p>We have already done significant work in that the songs have already been written and have been “quality” tested at live gigs. The songs that had the strongest reactions made the list and those that didn’t have gone back to the bench for more work. Now we just need to get the songs professional recorded and we need our gear updated for the live shows.</p>
<p>Below is a list of our expenses (in order of importance) so you can get a clear understanding of how the money in this campaign will be used:</p>
<p><strong><u>Professional Record and Product Music ($3219)</u></strong></p>
<ul><li>Record, mix, and master 10 songs ($2250)<ul>
<li>Standard studio cost is $45 an hour</li>
<li>Each song takes about 4-5 hours to record, mix, and master (so $225 a song)</li>
</ul>
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Graphic (Tucson) artist for CD art ($150)</li>
<li>Run of 500 CDs in sleeves ($750)</li>
<li>Get the songs onto music steaming services (Spotify, Pandora, etc.)<ul><li>It is really import to us that music is available to anyone who wants it. To get the songs onto media streaming services only runs $69. </li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Equipment Refresh ($1300)</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Jonica’s accordion is having pretty signifant issues but fortunately we have found a potential replacement for only $150</li>
<li>Geremy’s bass needs a major overhaul – estimating $200</li>
<li>The microphone stands are slowing breaking apart – estimating $50</li>
<li>Instrument cables are starting to go – estimating $100</li>
<li>Update the sound system for live performances<ul><li>Wireless system for street gigs ($800)</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Props, lights, and costumes ($300)</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lights and cloud props – estimating $150<ul><li>We want the live shows to remain feeling magical so we have included costs in for lights replacements and new cloud props</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Costumes – estimating $150<ul><li>That’s right, we have a costume budget. This should not be a surprise to you ;)</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Additional Overheard ($900)</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Indiegogo costs – the cost to run this campaign back to Indiegogo is 5% - estimating $300</li>
<li>Taxes – This counts as income and therefor there is about a 10% tax to consider – estimating $600</li>

<p><u><strong>HOW DID I GET HERE?</strong></u></p>
<p>On New Year’s Eve of 2016, I made the resolution to start meditating every day.</p>
<p>Something about meditation made me ask myself: <strong><i>what am I actually supposed to be doing with this life? What is my purpose while I’m alive?</i> This questioning led me down an unexpected path.</strong></p>
<p>I knew that I still loved making music and sharing it, but I started asking: how can it truly be used for good in the world? How can I do things with it, without any sense of shame or selfishness?</p>
<p>Eventually I found out about an academy in Vermont called MAPLE (Monastic Academy for the Preservation of Life on Earth), and their residential training program. I was intrigued because one of their missions is to help their trainees discover what they call their VOW: “<strong>A vow is your deepest commitment to be of service to all living beings in the way that is uniquely yours.</strong>”</p>
<p>So I took a huge chance, left amazing friends, musical projects, and my job in Los Angeles to move to Vermont, for the training. The training is in cultivating a deep mindfulness practice, doing good things in the world through non-profit development, and the intersection of those entities. I continue to live and train with an incredible community of spiritual practitioners and compassionate people. I live the lifestyle of what we can call a Modern Monastic, on a very strict <a href=""http://www.monasticacademy.com/schedule/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">schedule</a> of chanting, seated meditation and work for our organization and community.</p>
<p>Through this intense and deep training, new parts of myself have opened up that I never dreamed I would encounter. This has led me to find new energy and openness within my artistic prowess.</p>
<p>With immense gratitude, I accepted a small grant for <strong>FIRE SIGN</strong> from our non-profit. I went to Brooklyn in March 2018 to begin recording the album with my friend Jon Markson. Jon and I were in a band called Time Crisis together and we had one album, which is my favorite album I've ever worked on. It was our first time recording since 2009, and it’s been incredible to be working with him again.</p>
<p><strong>So now, I’m reaching out to you to help me complete the project!</strong></p>
<p>I'm about to travel to Brooklyn again to finish recording and mixing <strong>FIRE SIGN</strong>.</p>
<p>There are 10 songs on the record. They were written and produced in Los Angeles, Vermont, Maine, Philadelphia, and Washington DC.</p>
<p><u><strong>WHY DO I NEED FUNDING? WHY DO I DESERVE YOUR MONEY?</strong></u></p>
<p>Prior to starting training at MAPLE, I was able to independently afford and fund my albums, but now, because I’m in the training (which I’ve literally given up my entire life for), in exchange for a supportive and loving community, healthy food, and a bed to sleep on, I don't get paid.</p>
<p><i><strong>Your generosity will support me in my creative path, and in my spiritual path.</strong></i></p>
<p>You will be supporting me as a musician who deeply cares about giving their offering to the world from a place of true compassion. I’ve thoroughly considered the karmic affiliations of not hiding my songs from the world. <strong>This has given me strength, clarity, and zeal to share them with you!!</strong></p>
<p><u><strong>WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU HELPING ME PAY FOR?</strong></u></p>
<ul>
<li>Studio time with engineer + producer extraordinaire <a href=""https://www.discogs.com/artist/2600490-Jon-Markson"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jon Markson</a>
</li>
<li>Mastering (putting a beautiful sheen on the record once the mix is completed)</li>
<li>Art work by the talented <a href=""http://caitlinherrschaft.wixsite.com/caitlinherrschaft/portfolio"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Caitlin Herrschaft</a>
</li>
<li>Potential pressing of physical copies, merchandising</li>
<li>Uploading the record to streaming services</li>
</ul>
<p><u><strong>WHAT WILL I DO ONCE THIS ALBUM IS FINISHED? WHERE ARE YOU HELPING ME GO, AND HELPING ME TO DO?</strong></u></p>
<p>I want to be playing shows. Once this record is done, I plan on releasing it in late 2018 / early 2019, and promoting it around the world. I plan on starting gradually around the East Coast, and expanding from there. Hopefully I’ll see you at show.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you endlessly for your support. I absolutely cannot wait to share these songs with you.</strong></p>

<h3>Our Project</h3>
<p>Hey everyone! We're Ian Mullins and Jackson Gulick, AKA Matfield Green. We're a couple of singer-songwriters from Kansas living in Nashville, TN. The funny thing is, we didn't know each other until we met in Nashville three years ago (even though we grew up 40 miles apart)! It wasn't long after we started writing songs and playing shows together that we figured out we had a good thing going...  So we decided to make the duo Matfield Green! </p>
<p>Since then, we've played shows all over the map and written hundreds of songs with some of our best friends here in Music City. From that catalog, this project is a collection of six of our favorite songs we have ever been a part of. Now, all that's left to do is get in the studio and record this thing! We're so excited to get it out to you all!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>Your impact on us:</strong></p>
<p>Each contribution not only brings us one step closer to finally putting music out, but will also get the ball rolling for us in the music industry. Having an album out could potentially open a lot of doors for us on Music Row here in Nashville, as well as globally- through streaming, digital media platforms and even radio. </p>
<p>Another perk of having an album out is that we will now have the opportunity to tour! This will let us share our music with so many more people, as well as giving us the chance to meet all of you who have supported us over the years.</p>
<p><strong>Your impact on our hometown communities:</strong></p>
<p>After talking about what inspired us to create music, we decided that we wanted to give back to each of our incredible high school music programs. Five percent of all funding received will be shared between the music programs at Jefferson West High School and Shawnee Mission Northwest High School. We hope that this money can give a little back to the people and communities that gave us so much.</p>

<p><strong>THE AMINA FIGAROVA SEXTET has been in existence for twenty years, and to celebrate this anniversary she will release two new albums in the coming months.</strong></p>
<p>First in November: The <strong>Amina Figarova Sextet PLUS</strong>: She will add three strings to her sextet: Sara Caswell on violin, Lois Martin on viola, and Jody Redhage on cello.</p>
<p>The first album is comprised of two sessions: the first session recorded in June with Wayne Escoffery - tenor sax; Alex Pope Norris - trumpet; Bart Platteau - flute, Luques Curtis - bass, Jason Brown - drums, and Amina Figarova - piano, and the second session recorded in August with the Sextet Plus, with Marc Mommas on tenor and soprano sax, Brian Richburg Jr - an incredible 19 year old drummer from New Orleans, and Hasan Bakr as special guest on percussion.</p>
<p>The second album will be with a newly-created group:  ""<strong>Amina Figarova E Band</strong>"", with Rex Abbasi - guitar, Yasushi Nakamura - bass, Rudy Royston - drums, Bart Platteau - flute and EWI, and Amina on keyboard and piano. This album will be released in January, 2019.</p>
<p>Both albums will be released in CD format as well as vinyl.</p>
<p>The cover artwork for the sextet album will be created by a wonderful Brazilian artist, Chris Barreto.</p>
<p>Amina Figarova, born in Azerbaijan, is a phenomenal pianist and stunning composer, now based in New York. Her sextet is quickly developing a huge reputation on the international scene. For almost eighteen years, Amina has toured extensively, developing a tight-knit ensemble that, despite inevitable personnel changes, has attained a distinctive and inimitable voice by concentrating on an all-original repertoire. During that period, having collaborated with musicians residing in both the U.S. and Europe and having developed a circuit of welcoming venues, the Amina Figarova Sextet has triumphed at the main stage of the Newport Jazz Festival, has been invited repeatedly to the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, and has won critical and audience acclaim in Chicago, Detroit, Paris, Amsterdam - and of course, New York.</p>
<p>Amina's pieces strike a perfect tone, employing incomparably beautiful harmonizations, to capture fleeting thoughts that accompany those precious moments when the puzzling jostle of daily existence comes into unexpected but deep satisfying sync.</p>
<p>To make both of these albums possible, <strong>we need your help.</strong> The costs of recording, musicians, studios, and album replication are around $20,000 for the Sextet album and $ 15,000 for the E band album. Our goal is to raise with this campaign the half of all the costs, the amount of $ 17,500.</p>
<p>We need your support to be able to make and to keep on making this wonderfully creative music. You can help us by contributing to this campaign - any donation is appreciated. Please share this and spread the word. Hopefully, we'll see you either at the album release concerts at the Jazz Standard in New York City on Tuesday, November 13 or Wednesday November 14, or during our European tour between November 16 and December 6, 2018 in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Italy, and Spain.</p>

The second album will be with a newly-created group:  ""Amina Figarova E Band"", with Rex Abbasi - guitar, Yasushi Nakamura - bass, Rudy Royston - drums, Bart Platteau - flute and EWI, and Amina on keyboard and piano. This album will be released in January, 2019.
Both albums will be released in CD format as well as vinyl.
The cover artwork for the sextet album will be created by a wonderful Brazilian artist, Chris Barreto.
Amina Figarova, born in Azerbaijan, is a phenomenal pianist and stunning composer, now based in New York. Her sextet is quickly developing a huge reputation on the international scene. For almost eighteen years, Amina has toured extensively, developing a tight-knit ensemble that, despite inevitable personnel changes, has attained a distinctive and inimitable voice by concentrating on an all-original repertoire. During that period, having collaborated with musicians residing in both the U.S. and Europe and having developed a circuit of welcoming venues, the Amina Figarova Sextet has triumphed at the main stage of the Newport Jazz Festival, has been invited repeatedly to the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, and has won critical and audience acclaim in Chicago, Detroit, Paris, Amsterdam - and of course, New York.
Amina's pieces strike a perfect tone, employing incomparably beautiful harmonizations, to capture fleeting thoughts that accompany those precious moments when the puzzling jostle of daily existence comes into unexpected but deep satisfying sync.
To make both of these albums possible, we need your help. The costs of recording, musicians, studios, and album replication are around $20,000 for the Sextet album and $ 15,000 for the E band album. Our goal is to raise with this campaign the half of all the costs, the amount of $ 17,500.
We need your support to be able to make and to keep on making this wonderfully creative music. You can help us by contributing to this campaign - any donation is appreciated. Please share this and spread the word. Hopefully, we'll see you either at the album release concerts at the Jazz Standard in New York City on Tuesday, November 13 or Wednesday November 14, or during our European tour between November 16 and December 6, 2018 in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Italy, and Spain.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>I am Joi Najae Watts and I am a recording artist, actor and producer currently based in Savannah, Georgia. I am a senior Performing Arts major at Savannah College of Arts and Design and I will be graduating this spring. Music has always been a vital part of my life and watching music come to life through music videos made it even more special to me. That is what I want to do with my new single Solemate beat produced by Diggy Diamond. Solemate is a special piece to me because I am not only speaking of love, but I am also expressing how sometimes not everyone will love you for you, but there will always be that one person who sees and understands your full unique purpose here on earth. I want the music video of Solemate to represent happiness, fun times and not having a care in the world; especially with all that we as humankind have been going through. I want this music video to be not only entertaining, but I want it to pop and stick to your happy place in your mind as so many music videos did for me growing up today and still do. </p>
<p>Your help towards this project is extremely important to those aspects of the music video. With your help we will be able to make costume design, set design, location and make up standout. The location is an extremely important part to this music video and with your help it will really make my vision come alive. My sole purpose in my music career is to make and see others happy to ignite joy in people's hearts. Which is why this music video will be inclusive of all ethnicities, gender and not only is the music video cast multicultural but so is my team and I. I want younger multicultural audiences that watch this to know they are included, unique and beautiful. We need your help getting our work out there and bringing this sense of happiness to life in picture for this music video.</p>

<p>Well, hello there!</p>
<p>There is a great expectation we have for this year: to continue reaching our brothers and sisters around the world by being given the opportunity to enter into Praise &amp; Worship with them. In other words, we are working to record an entire album by the end of 2021, and we cannot do it on our own.</p>
<p>In the past couple of years, we have seen walls come down, hearts stirred and lives changed. We have seen how deeply others have been convicted to know Jesus more because of a simple song – and all that we have been a part of has only been possible through the grace of God and the generosity of His people.</p>
<p>So, today, our hope is this: that you might consider joining us on our mission by making a contribution to this campaign.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>We are a group of friends, musicians, servants, and Catholic worship leaders, otherwise known as Steadfast Worship. We are based in the Archdiocese of Toronto, where we are set on giving back to the place we call ‘home’ – and the Church as a whole – by using our gifts. In praying with songs that glorify God and align hearts with truth, beauty, and goodness, our ministry aims to lead listeners closer to Jesus Christ, and our hope is to inspire the Church by bringing Catholic culture to the forefront of modern Christian music and the world.</p>
<p><strong>Joseph Fabie</strong> is a vocalist and songwriter for Steadfast Worship. Joseph was born in the Philippines but has lived in Scarborough, Ontario since his family moved to Canada when he was six years old. Currently, Joseph works as a civil engineer-in-training in a consulting firm where he specializes in building science and restoration. Joseph also grew up pursuing music, performing various genres of music throughout his life - from musical theatre, sacred Catholic music, and his personal favourite, R&amp;B. He discovered Praise &amp; Worship music more recently, but has found in it a beautiful expression of devotion which brings him and those around him to a more intimate relationship with Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>Erica Cinco</strong> is one of Steadfast’s vocalists and one-time egg shaker. She’s a recent graduate of a certificate program at George Brown College and is pursuing a career in nursing (Update, she got accepted into her program! Yay PG!) Growing up in a Christian church, she was exposed to praise and worship at a young age and still continues to be moved and formed through music. One significant way praise and worship has helped her grow in her faith was in her reversion to Catholicism. It introduced her to other Catholics who love and desire to grow more deeply in a faith that unceasingly reveals the beauty and love of God through the Church (St. Barnabas familyyyyyy)!</p>
<p><strong>Jacob Kevin</strong> is the drummer/percussionist of Steadfast Worship. He was born and raised in Scarborough, Ontario and is currently studying at York University in the Mechanical Engineering program. During his 6th grade at St. Barnabas School, Jacob was asked to play the drums for school mass by his music teacher, where he learned to play Catholic hymns and songs of praise. Since then, using his gifts for praise and worship in youth groups and music ministries has drawn him closer to the heart of God and lead him to want to grow deeper in his faith.</p>
<p><strong>Camille Herrera</strong> is a singer and songwriter for Steadfast Worship. She has spent her whole life thus far in Markham and Stouffville, where she has recently wrapped up her time as the youth minister at St. Mark's Catholic Church. In August, she will be moving to Ottawa for a new (full-time missionary!) career as an Events Intern for Catholic Christian Outreach. Camille has been singing since she was taught to read through karaoke, and it was being introduced to praise &amp; worship in grade 7 that led to the recognition of her desire to make her voice a gift, and how beautiful it would be to serve the Lord through it.</p>
<p><strong>Gabe Marania</strong> is the main guitarist and bassist of Steadfast Worship. He grew up in Scarborough, Ontario, where he now works as the Music &amp; Media Communications Coordinator at St. Barnabas Roman Catholic Parish, Scarborough. Gabe has served in music ministry for 10 years and it was because of serving in music ministry that drove him into a deeper desire in getting to know the faith more intimately.</p>

<h3>What We Need (Our Budget)</h3>
<p>$15,000 may seem like a steep goal, but we assure you that every dollar that goes into our campaign will be used with purpose and integrity. The following list outlines in detail what your money will be used to help us build Steadfast Worship:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Recording Costs</strong> - $5650: This covers the costs of studio recording, mixing, and mastering at the rate of at least $500 per song. Moreover, these expenses ensure that we rightfully pay those who work tirelessly in the mixing and mastering process of each track.</li>

<li>
<strong>Equipment</strong> - $6350: This will include new equipment such as Shure Sm7B Mics, Speakers, Audio Interfaces, stands, cables and wires, which will be used for our live events and recordings. These costs will also cover any needed equipment reparations.</li>
<li>
<strong>Indiegogo</strong> - $1000: This covers two of the following Indiegogo fees: 5% commission fee of raised funds in return for the use of their platform,  2.9% payment processing fee, and a $0.30 fee per donation transaction.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There is an abundance of good that music can do. It is a common topic of conversation. It can heighten the experience of a presentation, or a film, or a moment. Above all this, it can easily bring people together. Paired with the greatest good of the Gospel, we have every confidence that these moments of prayer in Praise &amp; Worship can help to transform the world.</p>
<p>As for you, you have a place in this. If our goal is one that looks to reach souls across the globe, it only makes sense that the way to get there would involve leaning on the support of our brothers and sisters. By backing our campaign, you are helping us to be present for others in one of the greatest ways we know how to, shaping moments of conviction and conversion for others, and choosing to say ‘yes’ to even the possibility of lives being changed.</p>
<p>Here are some testimonies of people we have helped:</p>
<p><i>""It has been a blessing to have Steadfast lead the worship at our campus ministry events including Adoration nights. They were easy to contact and work with and sought to tailor their style to the unique needs of our theme and venue. They created a soulful, meditative way to enter into prayer with their unique vocal and instrumental duo. I would strongly recommend them for large or small ministry gatherings. In knowing some of the members personally, they provide an amazing example of what is it to throw themselves into the Lord's vineyard and depict an earnest desire to lead others to Christ through their music.""</i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">- <strong>Erica Figueiredo, </strong>Chaplaincy Director, UTSC &amp; Centennial College</p>
<p><i>""When we were bouncing off ideas on how to best lead our ministry leaders at the parish in worship that would honour the Lord and be memorable for everyone, we knew we wanted Steadfast Worship involved. Aside from being incredibly easy and flexible to work with, Steadfast created a space for us to encounter Jesus. Having Jesus at the centre of it all mattered to us, and you could see that it was the desire of their hearts as well and for that, we are so grateful.""</i> </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">- <strong>Pamela Clerigo, </strong>Youth Minister, St. Patrick Parish, Markham</p>
<p><i>""Steadfast Worship is a young adults music band actively involved in the youth ministry in several Catholic Parishes in the Archdiocese of Toronto. There I've had an opportunity to see and hear them, observing that their singing and even original music flow from ecstatic praise and yet humble yearning for the Lord as, for example, it may be experienced in their song, ""Alleluia"". I've seen them moving small groups and large masses of young people in humble worship of the Lord while passionately singing His praises. Steadfast Worship, stay humble as you evangelize and inspire new evangelists.""</i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">- <strong>Fr. Marijan Sisko, </strong>Pastor, Corpus Christ Parish, Toronto</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Okay, let’s lay out all the facts here! Though we might be tired of hearing it, we are still in the middle of a worldwide pandemic. We are setting up this campaign during a time when it could be most difficult for anyone to want to support us. For most of 2020, even we struggled to discern what it was we should be doing. For those of you who were familiar with our ministry before this campaign, you might have noticed that we seemingly disappeared for a time. And, honestly, that is because we did. When COVID-19 hit, every event we were booked for had been cancelled and we had to hit the brakes on recording. We lost opportunities, certainty, and, in some ways, tangible support. We had no idea what the Lord was calling us to do. For months, we found ourselves stuck in an unintended hiatus, and it took a 3-day retreat for us to finally decide to be more intentional in our ministry again.</p>
<p>So, here we are. Though the state of the world is still as it is, with finances fickle and certainty still in question, we know that the Lord is calling us to move. We still want to be present for others. We still want to use our gifts. We still want to serve our Church. All we can do is take the next best step and pray that others might feel compelled to work with us in taking many more.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Not every person is going to be able to help financially, and that is okay! Thankfully, there are other ways to get on board:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Prayer: </strong>Pray for our ministry, the work that we are doing, but especially those in whom we have encountered and those in whom we have yet to meet.</li>
<li>
<strong>Spread the word:</strong> Share this campaign with others through word of mouth or on any social media platforms.</li>

We are based in the Archdiocese of Toronto, where we are set on giving back to the place we call ‘home’ – and the Church as a whole – by using our gifts. In praying with songs that glorify God and align hearts with truth, beauty, and goodness, our ministry aims to lead listeners closer to Jesus Christ, and our hope is to inspire the Church by bringing Catholic culture to the forefront of modern Christian music and the world.
Joseph Fabie is a vocalist and songwriter for Steadfast Worship. Joseph was born in the Philippines but has lived in Scarborough, Ontario since his family moved to Canada when he was six years old. Currently, Joseph works as a civil engineer-in-training in a consulting firm where he specializes in building science and restoration. Joseph also grew up pursuing music, performing various genres of music throughout his life - from musical theatre, sacred Catholic music, and his personal favourite, R&B. He discovered Praise & Worship music more recently, but has found in it a beautiful expression of devotion which brings him and those around him to a more intimate relationship with Jesus.
Erica Cinco is one of Steadfast’s vocalists and one-time egg shaker. She’s a recent graduate of a certificate program at George Brown College and is pursuing a career in nursing (Update, she got accepted into her program! Yay PG!) Growing up in a Christian church, she was exposed to praise and worship at a young age and still continues to be moved and formed through music. One significant way praise and worship has helped her grow in her faith was in her reversion to Catholicism. It introduced her to other Catholics who love and desire to grow more deeply in a faith that unceasingly reveals the beauty and love of God through the Church (St. Barnabas familyyyyyy)!
Jacob Kevin is the drummer/percussionist of Steadfast Worship. He was born and raised in Scarborough, Ontario and is currently studying at York University in the Mechanical Engineering program. During his 6th grade at St. Barnabas School, Jacob was asked to play the drums for school mass by his music teacher, where he learned to play Catholic hymns and songs of praise. Since then, using his gifts for praise and worship in youth groups and music ministries has drawn him closer to the heart of God and lead him to want to grow deeper in his faith.
Camille Herrera is a singer and songwriter for Steadfast Worship. She has spent her whole life thus far in Markham and Stouffville, where she has recently wrapped up her time as the youth minister at St. Mark's Catholic Church. In August, she will be moving to Ottawa for a new (full-time missionary!) career as an Events Intern for Catholic Christian Outreach. Camille has been singing since she was taught to read through karaoke, and it was being introduced to praise & worship in grade 7 that led to the recognition of her desire to make her voice a gift, and how beautiful it would be to serve the Lord through it.
Gabe Marania is the main guitarist and bassist of Steadfast Worship. He grew up in Scarborough, Ontario, where he now works as the Music & Media Communications Coordinator at St. Barnabas Roman Catholic Parish, Scarborough. Gabe has served in music ministry for 10 years and it was because of serving in music ministry that drove him into a deeper desire in getting to know the faith more intimately.
 

What We Need (Our Budget)
$15,000 may seem like a steep goal, but we assure you that every dollar that goes into our campaign will be used with purpose and integrity. The following list outlines in detail what your money will be used to help us build Steadfast Worship:


Recording Costs - $5650: This covers the costs of studio recording, mixing, and mastering at the rate of at least $500 per song. Moreover, these expenses ensure that we rightfully pay those who work tirelessly in the mixing and mastering process of each track.

Album Artwork and Videos - $1000: This covers the commissioning of our artwork, including album design cover, video graphics, photography, and videography.

Marketing - $1000: This covers all of the work to create and sustain a website, new merchandise & promotional material for our album.

Equipment - $6350: This will include new equipment such as Shure Sm7B Mics, Speakers, Audio Interfaces, stands, cables and wires, which will be used for our live events and recordings. These costs will also cover any needed equipment reparations.

Indiegogo - $1000: This covers two of the following Indiegogo fees: 5% commission fee of raised funds in return for the use of their platform,  2.9% payment processing fee, and a $0.30 fee per donation transaction.

 

The Impact
There is an abundance of good that music can do. It is a common topic of conversation. It can heighten the experience of a presentation, or a film, or a moment. Above all this, it can easily bring people together. Paired with the greatest good of the Gospel, we have every confidence that these moments of prayer in Praise & Worship can help to transform the world.
As for you, you have a place in this. If our goal is one that looks to reach souls across the globe, it only makes sense that the way to get there would involve leaning on the support of our brothers and sisters. By backing our campaign, you are helping us to be present for others in one of the greatest ways we know how to, shaping moments of conviction and conversion for others, and choosing to say ‘yes’ to even the possibility of lives being changed.
Here are some testimonies of people we have helped:
""It has been a blessing to have Steadfast lead the worship at our campus ministry events including Adoration nights. They were easy to contact and work with and sought to tailor their style to the unique needs of our theme and venue. They created a soulful, meditative way to enter into prayer with their unique vocal and instrumental duo. I would strongly recommend them for large or small ministry gatherings. In knowing some of the members personally, they provide an amazing example of what is it to throw themselves into the Lord's vineyard and depict an earnest desire to lead others to Christ through their music.""
- Erica Figueiredo, Chaplaincy Director, UTSC & Centennial College
""When we were bouncing off ideas on how to best lead our ministry leaders at the parish in worship that would honour the Lord and be memorable for everyone, we knew we wanted Steadfast Worship involved. Aside from being incredibly easy and flexible to work with, Steadfast created a space for us to encounter Jesus. Having Jesus at the centre of it all mattered to us, and you could see that it was the desire of their hearts as well and for that, we are so grateful."" 
- Pamela Clerigo, Youth Minister, St. Patrick Parish, Markham
""Steadfast Worship is a young adults music band actively involved in the youth ministry in several Catholic Parishes in the Archdiocese of Toronto. There I've had an opportunity to see and hear them, observing that their singing and even original music flow from ecstatic praise and yet humble yearning for the Lord as, for example, it may be experienced in their song, ""Alleluia"". I've seen them moving small groups and large masses of young people in humble worship of the Lord while passionately singing His praises. Steadfast Worship, stay humble as you evangelize and inspire new evangelists.""
- Fr. Marijan Sisko, Pastor, Corpus Christ Parish, Toronto

 
Risks & Challenges
Okay, let’s lay out all the facts here! Though we might be tired of hearing it, we are still in the middle of a worldwide pandemic. We are setting up this campaign during a time when it could be most difficult for anyone to want to support us. For most of 2020, even we struggled to discern what it was we should be doing. For those of you who were familiar with our ministry before this campaign, you might have noticed that we seemingly disappeared for a time. And, honestly, that is because we did. When COVID-19 hit, every event we were booked for had been cancelled and we had to hit the brakes on recording. We lost opportunities, certainty, and, in some ways, tangible support. We had no idea what the Lord was calling us to do. For months, we found ourselves stuck in an unintended hiatus, and it took a 3-day retreat for us to finally decide to be more intentional in our ministry again.
So, here we are. Though the state of the world is still as it is, with finances fickle and certainty still in question, we know that the Lord is calling us to move. We still want to be present for others. We still want to use our gifts. We still want to serve our Church. All we can do is take the next best step and pray that others might feel compelled to work with us in taking many more.
 

Other Ways You Can Help
Not every person is going to be able to help financially, and that is okay! Thankfully, there are other ways to get on board:


Prayer: Pray for our ministry, the work that we are doing, but especially those in whom we have encountered and those in whom we have yet to meet.

Spread the word: Share this campaign with others through word of mouth or on any social media platforms.

<h3>Who Am I?</h3>
<p>Hey everyone! My name is Emily Groff, and if you know me you know I love music. By the time I was ten years old, I was already writing songs on wide-ruled school paper about the crazy world of a fourth grader using the few chords I knew. As I grew up, my music grew up with me. It became the way I processed the world around me and the more I learned about it the more I wanted to dive in head first. </p>
<p>I grew up in Miami Beach, FL, playing saxophone in my school bands and songleading in Jewish youth group. I attended URJ Camp Coleman and URJ Kutz Camp as a camper and was heavily involved in my youth group and NFTY-STR. Through my band experience, I found a love of ensemble playing and teaching music. Through my experiences in the Jewish community, I found a deeper connection to Judaism and a passion for creating community. This led to Vanderbilt University where I studied music education and led services at Hillel. I have spent amazing summers songleading at URJ Camp Coleman, URJ Six Points Sports Academy, and Gordon JCC Camp Davis. Today, I am an elementary music teacher, songleader, and songwriter based in Nashville, TN. Between working as a music teacher and working in the Jewish community here, I feel so lucky to be in a place where I get to do what I love everyday. </p>
<h3>This EP- Breathe</h3>
<p>Music is not just the way I process my world, but also the way I process and connect to Judaism. The four Jewish songs on Breathe are inspired by how I have related common experiences and emotions to Judaism through music. </p>
<p>Hashkiveinu- A desire for not just physical but also mental and emotional protection.</p>
<p>Shiru- Celebration. Music is how I celebrate. </p>
<p>Lo Yisa Goy- An outcry for unity.</p>
<p>Ahavat Olam- Having someone by your side, through good and bad times.</p>
<p>The namesake of the EP, Breathe, is about my struggles with performance anxiety. This song is included because without the events that inspired this song, this EP could not have happened. My performance anxiety began in college, and while it started in my solo saxophone performance, it bled into things like songleading and public speaking. My love of performing and being in front of a group gradually diminished and I started to dread doing it. My senior year, I had a professor tell me “you play the tenor saxophone like you love it” and I remember thinking “man, why can’t I just play it and feel that love”? I had a songwriting final due the next day, that line went into the first line of the chorus, and with the writing of that song I finally decided to work towards dealing with my performance anxiety and getting back out there. Life can be unexpected, scary, and have many twists and turns. It can feel so much easier to turn around than continue, even if you’re so close to where you want to go. Always remember to breathe, and keep going.</p>

<h3>Story Behind the Karen Lyu Jazz Experience CD</h3>
<div><ul></ul></div>
<div>
<span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Why did I fly from South Korea to New York to record this </span><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">special CD?</span><br/><br/>It's quite a story!!!<br/><br/>It starts in 1995. I was starting my jazz career in Minneapolis, MN, but I was considering moving to New York City, because things weren't going so well, being a newbie Korean-American jazz singer in MN who just graduated in 1993 with a BSS in Jazz Studies from Cornell College in IA. So, I decided to check out NYC.</div>
<p><br/>Amazingly, my old college roommate, Naomi, worked with the mother-in-law of legendary actor, Nathan Purdee, who played Hank Gannon on the soap opera, One Life to Live, and she put in a good word for me! So, I got to house-sit his extra NYC apartment with my high-school friend, Jenny. I had a nice, healthy lunch with Nathan, and he amazingly took me on the set of One Life to Live and introduced me to everyone, which was unforgettable!!!</p>
<p>While in New York, I had dinner with Ravi Coltrane (son of John Coltrane)—who I met in Minneapolis 3 weeks prior, when he played with veteran jazz pianist, Joanne Brackeen, at the Dakota. I asked him about his dreams, and he mentioned that Lonnie Plaxico was his favorite bassist, but that he was too green and doubted that Lonnie would ever play with him?! I encouraged him, but he was humble. Lonnie has played with multiple Grammy-award-winners, including Cassandra Wilson, Art Blakey, Chet Baker, Dexter Gordon, and Wynton Marsalis!!!<br/><br/>Two days later, I went with my friend, Jenny, to Birdland. And, Lonnie just happened to be playing there! So I gave Lonnie Ravi's number, and they have gigged, recorded and toured together a number of times over the years since then!!!<br/><br/>I went back to Minneapolis, got a day job, started my Karen Lyu &amp; Global Jazz band, and never returned to New York. But, Lonnie kept in touch with me about once a year, by phone or email. Then, he found me on MySpace and we later connected on Facebook, when I lived in Nashville, and he always remembered to wish me a happy birthday!<br/><br/>Suddenly, last November, Lonnie called to let me know that he was flying to Seoul, where I live now, to perform with Cassandra Wilson!!! I tried to see him perform with Cassandra Wilson in Minnesota before, but he wasn't playing with her at that time. Sadly, we missed each other again due to circumstances beyond our control. I was despondent, but Lonnie said, ""We'll meet in New York, someday. Don't worry!""</p>
</div>
<p>Then, out of the blue, 3 months later, Dave Anderson, a renown Rochester, NY producer/recording engineer/songwriter/and radio show host friended me on Facebook based on our mutual platinum award-winning songwriter friend, Roy August, in Nashville, TN. After a few video chats about songwriting and potentially recording vocals of his original songs in Seoul, Dave bought and listened to my Karen Lyu &amp; Fresh Jazz CD. And, he was so inspired that he generously invited me to record a new CD on spec at his dream recording studio, which he was building in Rochester, NY!!!</p>
<p>The first thing I did was contact Lonnie Plaxico, who offered to record with me for free. (minus room, board, and airfare)!!! And, it was on!!!</p>
<p>Miraculously, the resources suddenly appeared in my life to not only make this unexpected recording opportunity happen, but also to fund a 3-City US Birthday Tour!!! The music tour took me to Minneapolis, MN to perform with my former Global Jazz band members, to Nashville, TN to perform with my former Fresh Jazz band members, to NY to record at Saxon Recording in Rochester, NY, and also to New York City to perform at Rockwood Music Hall with Lonnie and world-class NYC jazz cats!!! It was great to see old friends and fans, and meet new fans!!<br/><br/>In 1996, I woke up in the middle of the night from a vivid dream of touring with amazing international musicians wearing colorful clothes, that I designed, for a huge and lively audience in Brazil! Please help me on the path to making this dream come true! My ex-boyfriend remembers and believes in me still!</p>

Story Behind the Karen Lyu Jazz Experience CD


Why did I fly from South Korea to New York to record this special CD?It's quite a story!!!It starts in 1995. I was starting my jazz career in Minneapolis, MN, but I was considering moving to New York City, because things weren't going so well, being a newbie Korean-American jazz singer in MN who just graduated in 1993 with a BSS in Jazz Studies from Cornell College in IA. So, I decided to check out NYC.
Amazingly, my old college roommate, Naomi, worked with the mother-in-law of legendary actor, Nathan Purdee, who played Hank Gannon on the soap opera, One Life to Live, and she put in a good word for me! So, I got to house-sit his extra NYC apartment with my high-school friend, Jenny. I had a nice, healthy lunch with Nathan, and he amazingly took me on the set of One Life to Live and introduced me to everyone, which was unforgettable!!!
While in New York, I had dinner with Ravi Coltrane (son of John Coltrane)—who I met in Minneapolis 3 weeks prior, when he played with veteran jazz pianist, Joanne Brackeen, at the Dakota. I asked him about his dreams, and he mentioned that Lonnie Plaxico was his favorite bassist, but that he was too green and doubted that Lonnie would ever play with him?! I encouraged him, but he was humble. Lonnie has played with multiple Grammy-award-winners, including Cassandra Wilson, Art Blakey, Chet Baker, Dexter Gordon, and Wynton Marsalis!!!Two days later, I went with my friend, Jenny, to Birdland. And, Lonnie just happened to be playing there! So I gave Lonnie Ravi's number, and they have gigged, recorded and toured together a number of times over the years since then!!!I went back to Minneapolis, got a day job, started my Karen Lyu & Global Jazz band, and never returned to New York. But, Lonnie kept in touch with me about once a year, by phone or email. Then, he found me on MySpace and we later connected on Facebook, when I lived in Nashville, and he always remembered to wish me a happy birthday!Suddenly, last November, Lonnie called to let me know that he was flying to Seoul, where I live now, to perform with Cassandra Wilson!!! I tried to see him perform with Cassandra Wilson in Minnesota before, but he wasn't playing with her at that time. Sadly, we missed each other again due to circumstances beyond our control. I was despondent, but Lonnie said, ""We'll meet in New York, someday. Don't worry!""

Then, out of the blue, 3 months later, Dave Anderson, a renown Rochester, NY producer/recording engineer/songwriter/and radio show host friended me on Facebook based on our mutual platinum award-winning songwriter friend, Roy August, in Nashville, TN. After a few video chats about songwriting and potentially recording vocals of his original songs in Seoul, Dave bought and listened to my Karen Lyu & Fresh Jazz CD. And, he was so inspired that he generously invited me to record a new CD on spec at his dream recording studio, which he was building in Rochester, NY!!!
The first thing I did was contact Lonnie Plaxico, who offered to record with me for free. (minus room, board, and airfare)!!! And, it was on!!!
Miraculously, the resources suddenly appeared in my life to not only make this unexpected recording opportunity happen, but also to fund a 3-City US Birthday Tour!!! The music tour took me to Minneapolis, MN to perform with my former Global Jazz band members, to Nashville, TN to perform with my former Fresh Jazz band members, to NY to record at Saxon Recording in Rochester, NY, and also to New York City to perform at Rockwood Music Hall with Lonnie and world-class NYC jazz cats!!! It was great to see old friends and fans, and meet new fans!!In 1996, I woke up in the middle of the night from a vivid dream of touring with amazing international musicians wearing colorful clothes, that I designed, for a huge and lively audience in Brazil! Please help me on the path to making this dream come true! My ex-boyfriend remembers and believes in me still!
IN MEMORIAMIn loving memory of my Auntie Yeon-ok Kim, my Second Mom, who believed in me and my music. She died on Saturday, May 18th. Also, in loving memory of my SuperFan Friend, Janet Johnson, who was one of my biggest supporters in Minnesota of all my creative endeavors. She died of cancer on Saturday, May 25th.PRESS RELEASEhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1-VX4jsyhwUU... HOW DOES A WALLFLOWER BECOME AN AWARD-WINNING JAZZ VOCALIST?Toastmasters Icebreaker Speech by Karen Lyu(2x Toastmasters Best Speaker award-winner)​https://docs.google.com/document/d/10npN7v52IWZ...

<h3>UPDATE: This album will be made regardless.  Your contributions will help give it more ""polish and push"" :)</h3>
<h3>What is this about?</h3>
<p>Greetings!  I don't want to make a huge scrolling page so I will make this as brief as possible!</p>
<ul>
<li>I am Jordan Aguirre, aka bLiNd and have been producing electronic music for 20 years now.</li>
<li>This campaign is about supporting THE album by bLiNd, this is the big one.  Basically I make an album every 2 weeks of standard dance music and release on my bandcamp but now I want to really get creative and try something completely new and different.  The style I am choosing is a genre that literally just blipped on the radar for a brief time in the 90s.  The Chemical Brothers, The Prodigy, The Crystal Method, Propellerheads, Future Sound of London and Leftfield were all huge influences on me growing up thanks to the Hackers Movie soundtracks and Wipeout XL for the Playstation.  I was only 14-16 when the sound was hot but it was MEGA inspiring.  So I want to revive it in my own way!</li>
<li>This could be bigger than I expect mainly because the style would be new to many ears and I plan on pushing it a lot more than I do my other music.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>If you are a fan of <strong>Fat of the Land</strong> by <strong>The Prodigy</strong>, <strong>Dig Your Own Hole</strong> by <strong>Chemical Brothers</strong>, <strong>Vegas </strong>by <strong>Crystal Method</strong>,<strong> The Hackers Soundtracks</strong>, <strong>Wipeout XL Soundtrack</strong> etc, then this campaign is for you, most definitely.  Even if you aren't a huge fan of the styles, the perks may be worth it as I am offering my entire catalog to backers.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need at least $5,000 to cover the costs to produce this album</p>
<ul>
<li>$1,000 Minimum goes to Marketing and ADs</li>
<li>$1,000 for Mastering</li>
<li>$2,000 for Hiring other Musicians and Vocalists</li>
<li>$1,000 for Extra Artwork</li>
</ul>
<p>If you back me, you get things!</p>
<p>EVERYONE that joins gets access to livestreams and the songs as I finish them.  On the completion of the indiegogo campaign, most perks will be delivered including the tracks that are already completed (currently 3.5)</p>
<ul>
<li>$1 gets you an album off my bandcamp (and the first single off the album immediately)</li>
<li>$5 gets you 5 albums off my bandcamp  (and the first single of the album immediately)</li>
<li>$10 gets you the above plus the digital release of the album</li>
<li>$20 gets you the above plus the physical release of the album (CD)</li>
<li>$75 gets you the above all above plus a Vinyl copy</li>
<li>$100 gets you all the above plus my entire 2019 release list (nearly 30 releases/20 albums as a download)</li>
<li>$200 gets you all the above plus my ENTIRE discography (<a href=""http://blindhandicap.bandcamp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://blindhandicap.bandcamp.com</a>)</li>
<li>$250 gets you all the above plus every CD I have released (28 cds total)</li>
<li>$750 gets you all the above plus every Vinyl I have released (10 vinyls total, 28 cds total :O</li>
</ul>
<p>I won't be signing these as it adds 3 extra steps to shipping and processing.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>This album could potentially help revive a sound that has been lost in time!</li>
<li>I will be marketing through Move Music Distribution, who is my publisher, and they are plugged into big names in the dance music industry which could give it the boost it needs to be truly heard by people into the sound.</li>
<li>I will be crafting every song from scratch, no sample packs or presets, as there isn't much in the style anyway. </li>
<li>I will be using HARDWARE for the sounds (because it's more fun and some of it truly sounds magical compared to software sources)</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573924118/jceabpdz7funsqlbszxd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I currently have NO jobs I am working on (just finished 2 game soundtracks) so this campaign is a bit of a need as well.  If it doesn't succeed I may have to cancel the project for the moment and refocus my energies</p>
<ul>
<li>I WILL deliver the album as promised probably within just a few months as I work EXTREMELY fast. </li>
<li>The more support I get the more polished the album will be most likely.  I will hire original vocalists and artists to help bring the vision to life.</li>
<li>Even if the campaign doesn't reach the goal, anything helps as this is a flexible campaign (not fixed) so don't think your contribution won't be acknowledge or appreciated.  This album will be made regardless of this funding and will be marketed as well!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can't contribute, I appreciate you telling those that would be interested!</p>
<ul>
<li>Resharing helps me TONS!</li>
<li>Share using the indiegogo share tools!</li>

What is this about?
Greetings!  I don't want to make a huge scrolling page so I will make this as brief as possible!

I am Jordan Aguirre, aka bLiNd and have been producing electronic music for 20 years now.
This campaign is about supporting THE album by bLiNd, this is the big one.  Basically I make an album every 2 weeks of standard dance music and release on my bandcamp but now I want to really get creative and try something completely new and different.  The style I am choosing is a genre that literally just blipped on the radar for a brief time in the 90s.  The Chemical Brothers, The Prodigy, The Crystal Method, Propellerheads, Future Sound of London and Leftfield were all huge influences on me growing up thanks to the Hackers Movie soundtracks and Wipeout XL for the Playstation.  I was only 14-16 when the sound was hot but it was MEGA inspiring.  So I want to revive it in my own way!
This could be bigger than I expect mainly because the style would be new to many ears and I plan on pushing it a lot more than I do my other music.

 
If you are a fan of Fat of the Land by The Prodigy, Dig Your Own Hole by Chemical Brothers, Vegas by Crystal Method, The Hackers Soundtracks, Wipeout XL Soundtrack etc, then this campaign is for you, most definitely.  Even if you aren't a huge fan of the styles, the perks may be worth it as I am offering my entire catalog to backers.

What I Need & What You Get
I need at least $5,000 to cover the costs to produce this album

$1,000 Minimum goes to Marketing and ADs
$1,000 for Mastering
$2,000 for Hiring other Musicians and Vocalists
$1,000 for Extra Artwork

If you back me, you get things!
EVERYONE that joins gets access to livestreams and the songs as I finish them.  On the completion of the indiegogo campaign, most perks will be delivered including the tracks that are already completed (currently 3.5)

$1 gets you an album off my bandcamp (and the first single off the album immediately)
$5 gets you 5 albums off my bandcamp  (and the first single of the album immediately)
$10 gets you the above plus the digital release of the album
$20 gets you the above plus the physical release of the album (CD)
$75 gets you the above all above plus a Vinyl copy
$100 gets you all the above plus my entire 2019 release list (nearly 30 releases/20 albums as a download)
$200 gets you all the above plus my ENTIRE discography (http://blindhandicap.bandcamp.com)
$250 gets you all the above plus every CD I have released (28 cds total)
$750 gets you all the above plus every Vinyl I have released (10 vinyls total, 28 cds total :O

I won't be signing these as it adds 3 extra steps to shipping and processing.  

The Impact

This album could potentially help revive a sound that has been lost in time!
I will be marketing through Move Music Distribution, who is my publisher, and they are plugged into big names in the dance music industry which could give it the boost it needs to be truly heard by people into the sound.
I will be crafting every song from scratch, no sample packs or presets, as there isn't much in the style anyway. 
I will be using HARDWARE for the sounds (because it's more fun and some of it truly sounds magical compared to software sources)



Risks & Challenges
I currently have NO jobs I am working on (just finished 2 game soundtracks) so this campaign is a bit of a need as well.  If it doesn't succeed I may have to cancel the project for the moment and refocus my energies

I WILL deliver the album as promised probably within just a few months as I work EXTREMELY fast. 
The more support I get the more polished the album will be most likely.  I will hire original vocalists and artists to help bring the vision to life.
Even if the campaign doesn't reach the goal, anything helps as this is a flexible campaign (not fixed) so don't think your contribution won't be acknowledge or appreciated.  This album will be made regardless of this funding and will be marketed as well!


Other Ways You Can Help
Even if you can't contribute, I appreciate you telling those that would be interested!

Resharing helps me TONS!

<h3>Hi! I'm Mandy.</h3>
<p>Sharing music with kids and their family is my biggest passion. I have dedicated my entire life to it!</p>
<p>Music with Mandy began in August of 2017 when I combined my experience as an educator with my passion for performing jazz. I have been lucky enough to have performed throughout Western Canada at theatres, libraries, preschools and retirement facilities with highlight shows at the National Music Centre, JazzYYC, Hay Days Festival, Fernie’s Culture on the Lawn and Enkindle with JUNO nominated artist Ginalina. Music with Mandy’s debut album, “On the Sunny Side of the Street”, was released in conjunction with a colouring book that I illustrated. It has been praised by families and jazz fans alike. It was recently nominated for Jazz Recording of the Year at the YYC Music Awards. In addition to my work as an artist, I work hard to promote the arts in my community. In May 2019 I founded a brand new children’s festival in Calgary called Create Kids Fest which presented 15 performances over the course of three days at two venues featuring music, dance, theatre, storytelling and visual art. I am also the youngest member on the JazzYYC board of directors where I work to introduce jazz to a wider audience in Calgary.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>From My Head to My Toes</h3>
<p>“From My Head to My Toes” is Music with Mandy's second full length album. It features a fresh take on children’s music that promotes self awareness, cultural awareness and emotional intelligence. The music on this album allows kids to explore their body, emotions and empathy. I have used my experience as a performer and educator to write songs in collaboration with composer, Matt Morris, that are entertaining and educational. Kids are invited to be present with the music through movement, silly stories and call and response. Children have always inspired my songwriting and will continue to on this album. You will hear them sing on some tracks to create a sound that is inspired by Raffi and the children’s music of Vince Guaraldi.</p>
<h3>The Team</h3>
<p><u>Matt Morris</u></p>
<p>My musical collaborator, Matt Morris, is a pianist, composer and educator. He studied classical composition at the University of Lethbridge and jazz performance and composition at Grant MacEwan University. For the past ten years he has worked with children to introduce them to and develop their understanding of music. Matt teaches piano, theory and composition lessons at Chinook School of Music where his patient demeanour allows children to develop their own unique musical voice. On this project he will be working as composer and I’ll serve as lyricist and arranger. In the studio and on stage Matt has and will continue to kill it on the keys. His playing style is whimsical and minimalist which allows kids to dig into his sound.</p>
<p><u>Kodi Hutchinson</u></p>
<p>Kodi Hutchinson is a WCMA nominated producer and bass player who has worked with JUNO winner Laila Biali and JUNO nominated artists Al Muirhead and PJ Perry. He is a leader of The Hutchinson Andrew Trio which won the 2013 TD Grand Jazz Award from the Montreal International Jazz Festival. Kodi is a great player, jazz advocate, industry person and producer which make him an obvious choice for any jazz album. What makes him the perfect fit for this project is his upbeat, happy-go-lucky personality and his recent jump into fatherhood. His passion for bringing accessible, high quality music to young children comes from passion for sharing music with his one and a half year old daughter. I have worked with Kodi since the inception of Music with Mandy and have used his expert guidance to bring my career this far. Kodi will bring his skills as producer and player to “From My Head to My Toes” which will be sure to please discerning jazz critics and children’s advocates alike. As a producer he favours clean, precise sounds which are perfect for kids tunes and as a player he lays down the groove with confident and ease and throws in the occasional playful lick to keep the audience intrigued.</p>
<p><u>Ian Yule</u></p>
<p>Ian Yule is a father and multi-instrumentalist who grew up in Manitoba, studied jazz drums at McGill before settling in Calgary. He has toured North America with Onlyforward and has been playing with Music with Mandy since it began and will join us again on this recording. It is important in jazz that the bass player and drummer have a strong connection. Kodi and Ian work together as a unit providing the foundation for the Mandy and her musical guests to explore the arrangements with freedom. The album explores grooves like swing, free jazz, bossa nova and funk. Ian moves flawlessly between them thanks to experience in both the jazz and contemporary world.</p>
<p><u>Spencer Cheyne</u></p>
<p>Spencer Cheyne is a JUNO-award winning Mixer/Producer/Drummer who has been nominated for multiple additional JUNOs, WCMAs and CCMAs. He’s one of the busiest engineers in Western Canada thanks to his extensive training with Manny Marroquin (Katy Perry, Rihanna, Kanye West) and Michael Brauer (Coldplay, Bob Dylan, Rolling Stones). He has worked with top notch talents such as Tommy Banks, PJ Perry, Paul Brandt and Raffi to name a few. His combined talents as a musician and engineer have given him the golden ear which is exactly what we need to bring the magic of a Music with Mandy live performance to a recorded album</p>

I am also the youngest member on the JazzYYC board of directors where I work to introduce jazz to a wider audience in Calgary.

From My Head to My Toes
“From My Head to My Toes” is Music with Mandy's second full length album. It features a fresh take on children’s music that promotes self awareness, cultural awareness and emotional intelligence. The music on this album allows kids to explore their body, emotions and empathy. I have used my experience as a performer and educator to write songs in collaboration with composer, Matt Morris, that are entertaining and educational. Kids are invited to be present with the music through movement, silly stories and call and response. Children have always inspired my songwriting and will continue to on this album. You will hear them sing on some tracks to create a sound that is inspired by Raffi and the children’s music of Vince Guaraldi.
The Team
Matt Morris
My musical collaborator, Matt Morris, is a pianist, composer and educator. He studied classical composition at the University of Lethbridge and jazz performance and composition at Grant MacEwan University. For the past ten years he has worked with children to introduce them to and develop their understanding of music. Matt teaches piano, theory and composition lessons at Chinook School of Music where his patient demeanour allows children to develop their own unique musical voice. On this project he will be working as composer and I’ll serve as lyricist and arranger. In the studio and on stage Matt has and will continue to kill it on the keys. His playing style is whimsical and minimalist which allows kids to dig into his sound.
Kodi Hutchinson
Kodi Hutchinson is a WCMA nominated producer and bass player who has worked with JUNO winner Laila Biali and JUNO nominated artists Al Muirhead and PJ Perry. He is a leader of The Hutchinson Andrew Trio which won the 2013 TD Grand Jazz Award from the Montreal International Jazz Festival. Kodi is a great player, jazz advocate, industry person and producer which make him an obvious choice for any jazz album. What makes him the perfect fit for this project is his upbeat, happy-go-lucky personality and his recent jump into fatherhood. His passion for bringing accessible, high quality music to young children comes from passion for sharing music with his one and a half year old daughter. I have worked with Kodi since the inception of Music with Mandy and have used his expert guidance to bring my career this far. Kodi will bring his skills as producer and player to “From My Head to My Toes” which will be sure to please discerning jazz critics and children’s advocates alike. As a producer he favours clean, precise sounds which are perfect for kids tunes and as a player he lays down the groove with confident and ease and throws in the occasional playful lick to keep the audience intrigued.
Ian Yule
Ian Yule is a father and multi-instrumentalist who grew up in Manitoba, studied jazz drums at McGill before settling in Calgary. He has toured North America with Onlyforward and has been playing with Music with Mandy since it began and will join us again on this recording. It is important in jazz that the bass player and drummer have a strong connection. Kodi and Ian work together as a unit providing the foundation for the Mandy and her musical guests to explore the arrangements with freedom. The album explores grooves like swing, free jazz, bossa nova and funk. Ian moves flawlessly between them thanks to experience in both the jazz and contemporary world.
Spencer Cheyne
Spencer Cheyne is a JUNO-award winning Mixer/Producer/Drummer who has been nominated for multiple additional JUNOs, WCMAs and CCMAs. He’s one of the busiest engineers in Western Canada thanks to his extensive training with Manny Marroquin (Katy Perry, Rihanna, Kanye West) and Michael Brauer (Coldplay, Bob Dylan, Rolling Stones). He has worked with top notch talents such as Tommy Banks, PJ Perry, Paul Brandt and Raffi to name a few. His combined talents as a musician and engineer have given him the golden ear which is exactly what we need to bring the magic of a Music with Mandy live performance to a recorded album
What will the funds be used for?This campaign will cover the studio time, engineering costs and mastering. Any additional funds will be used towards musician fees, producer fees and marketing.

<p><strong>About Us</strong></p>
<p>Our story began as a group of friends and family practicing spiritual ceremonies to improve ourselves and sharing music that help facilitate our growth. Being a guest at Pagan Spirit Gathering Festival, we were called upon to fill in a musical spot for a band that unfortunately was not be able to come. The community welcomed us and encouraged us to work a whole year and put together a prepared musical ensemble which played the following year and was well received. We are now in the forward phase of our next step, which is to record an album for our community who have supported us from the start and a way to share our music, experience, and story to the world!<br/><br/>Recording this album would be very special not just to us, but to the many supporters who have been asking for our music for a year now, since we were called upon to be a band. As young artists and musicians, getting funding for this album will help make it into a reality and help us afford the right professional help to capture our music magic, message and delivery.<br/><br/>Your contributions: will allow us to hire a good producer, purchase and press the full album cd and other merch like stickers, posters, shirt. .. etc. You will not only be helping fund us, but will be giving us inspiration, hope, and nourishment as we continue to pursue this path of being musical artists.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Who We Are</strong></p>
<p>The Thundersirens is a multifaceted ceremony inspired musical group that combines sound therapy, shamanic influences and a variety of styles of music into their performances. Their music draws inspiration from each individual’s personal experience in their healing journeys, devotion to their spiritual work, and a variety of different ethnic soundscapes, tribal beats, with blues, rock, folk, and jazz fusion delivery that make their sound powerful and unique.    </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We will need around $3,000 on a very tight budget. About $2,000 will go to our recording cost and mixing the album. The reminder will go into producing and pressing the cd’s and packaging as well as delivery, and printing some stickers, artwork and band merch (if there’s enough in the budget).  <br/><br/>We have prepared a list of ways to donate and our unique perks which includes personal artwork and signed merch. Each level has an appropriate incentive and a copy of our cd starts at $20 donation<br/><br/>If we do not reach everything in the fund, it will go into a future fund as we continue to campaign in other ways to reach the benchmark to record a cd.</p>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Flashpoint CD/DVD Concert</span></h3>
<h3> </h3>
<p>I'm Aaron Gayden and I am a full-time musician. I try to make the world a better place one song at a time. I play in several bands including my own and work full time at my church doing music. My music ranges from orchestral to R&amp;B and Jazz to Gospel and multiple genres in between. My guitar player, from my church (and a band leader in his own right) Tim Brisson,, reminded me that we'd been talking about doing a CD of my Gospel music for over a year and he gave me a swift kick in the rear and pretty much said ""Let's do it now!"" </p>
<p>He has essentially said my music has impacted him and helped him tell his story about his recovery and he believes it needs to get out into the world. So here we are.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Budget and I do mean budget...</h3>
<p>A lot of favors have been called in. My budget for a previous attempt at capturing my music was $15,000 just for a CD. We're just trying to raise 1/3 of that. $5000. I have a lot of fellow starving artists who just want to help get the music to you! Ideally, I would like to make that not have to be the case for my fellow artists. But at the very least there are the hard costs such as manufacturing that need to be covered. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What does it all do?</h3>
<p>I believe this is just the beginning. In the past, my band has taken on such causes as the Haiti earthquake, sex trafficking and fundraising for a young man stricken down in a freak accident to become a paraplegic in the prime of his life. Music is what I do so whenever there is a problem I am likely to throw music at it. Music is one of my tools to help brighten lives on any level I can. Like I said, I believe this is just the beginning. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>You can help make it happen.</h3>
<p>I hope you will join me to get the ball rolling. Just one dollar from you and 4999 of your closest friends can help me get started bringing a little more love, joy  and hope into our crazy world. There's a lot more to it. But I figure that's enough to start with. Just a dollar.  </p>

<h3>Help Pat Donaher create a very special occasion! </h3>
<p> <u>Occasionally</u> will feature Pat's music realized by Allison Miller, Jason Palmer, Carmen Staaf, Tony Scherr, and Tim Watson, at Samurai Hotel in Queens, NYC</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The goal for this campaign covers the following expenses</p>
<ul>
<li>musicians' salaries (80%)</li>
<li>2/3 of the cost of the studio time (the first third is paid for) (13%)</li>
<li>the cost of the merchandise you receive (7%)</li>
</ul>
<p>If we reach our first goal, these are our stretch goals</p>
<ul>
<li>$14,500, would cover the cost of mastering with one of the best in the world</li>
<li>$17,000 would let me hire one of the best jazz and new music PR firms in the world, to make sure this music is heard everywhere.  </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Making an album like this, with really personal meaningful music being interpreted by some of the best musicians on the planet, has been a dream of mine since I was a kid.  But now it's even more important</p>
<ul>
<li>All of the players on this record have seen all of their upcoming gigs and tours, and hence most of their livelihood, go up in smoke due to the pandemic.  No one is booking gigs for at least six months, and the future of venues is very much at risk.  Likewise, the studio and its team, who are responsible for so many amazing recordings, have been sitting idle for months.  My hope is this project can be a shot in the arm for them, both musically and financially.  It's not enough, by any means, but it's something.</li>
<li>I've done one crowdsourcing project before, for my third album ""Who We Are Together"".  It was a success beyond my expectations.  This is a much bigger ask, but I'm hoping we can make this one just as successful</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Ordinarily, I'd say the biggest risk is that we don't make our goal, and I'm left figuring out how to make up the difference and make the album happen.  Because I have people counting on me, especially.  But, obviously, these are not ordinary times.  </p>
<p>The biggest risk, near term, is that New York is not ready to open recording studios for our late August date, which has been on the books for several months now.  Hopefully, given the circumstances, everyone involved can be flexible and we can push the project back, or (an unpleasant prospect) do it in another space. I hope you will be patient in this unusual moment.</p>
<p>For the past six years I've been working as a music educator in a high school.  Wynton Marsalis likes to say that educators are more than just teachers- we have to be counselors, coaches, travel agents, referees, surrogates.  I know what he's talking about.  If I can talk a group of twenty teenagers off the proverbial cliff, I can manage this project.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I realize that for a lot of folks right now, things are hard.  So if you can't support this project financially, but you want to help keep the music going:</p>

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>I'm <strong>Adam Bauer</strong> and I've been singing and playing sacred music for 30+ years. In 2014 I released a partially crowd-funded sacred chant album, <strong>Shyam Lila</strong>--which was a critically acclaimed success and one of the true honors of my life. I remain humbled and grateful for everyone who helped bring that into form!</p>

<p>I am <strong>profoundly grateful</strong> for the support I've felt (from the Universe <i>and</i> from humans) these last years as I've traveled all over the world offering these devotional chants through my own voice.

<p>With your help, we will be able to complete a record I began one year ago in the ancient city of Varanasi India with some of the finest musicians in that city known for profound musicianship.  Working with <strong>Ben Leinbach</strong>, one of the world's best known producers of sacred and world music, has been a real pleasure, and I've been blessed with the support and contributions of a host of incredible artists, players like <strong>Steve Gorn</strong> (bansuri), <strong>Hans Christian</strong> (cello), <strong>John McDowell</strong> (piano and organ) and many others. We are almost finished recording, and so far it's sounding great! Much remains to be done, however, and here's where you come in. The last rounds of recording, mixing and mastering, album cover design, CD production will cost about $14k, so I'm inviting a little help from my friends as we navigate these last rounds of creativity and expense on our way to releasing this new album later in Summer of 2017. Thank you in advance for helping us make it happen!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So far, I've paid (happily!) for everything out of my own pocket. Now, I'm seeking $10,800 in order to partially cover the following expenses, estimated at $13,408:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remaining musicians' &amp; singers' fees: $2500 </li>
<li>Studio recording &amp; production time: $3600 (6 days at $600/day)</li>
<li>Final mixing &amp; mastering time: $4200 (7 days at $600/day)</li>
<li>Album art, design &amp; creative: $1000</li>
<li>Printing and manufacturing of first round of physical CDs: $2000</li>
<li>Lunch and superfood smoothies for Ben so he stays sharp and happy: $108.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most basic ""perks"" on offer are simple: just pre-buy the album! This one easy thing, when lots of people act together, can help immensely. In addition, there will be other perks for participating at different levels; these will range from copies of the last album, <strong>Shyam Lila</strong>, to private house concerts for you and your friends, to an executive producer credit on the album,  and more.</p>
<p>If we don't reach the goal, I'll just keep traveling and singing and pouring money into the project as I can, and one day, insh'Allah, we will finish this beautiful labor of love and offer it to you, with our love and gratitude.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><i>The Impact</i></h3>
<p>The last time I ran an Indiegogo campaign, it helped me make the <a href=""http://www.iamadambauer.com/shyam-lila"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Shyam Lila</a> album, and people's responses to that album continue to move and humble me deeply as it continues to make its way through the world. It takes a village to make a record, and I'm deeply grateful for the beautiful folks who live in my village--thanks for being part of the lila! </p>
</div><div>
<h3><i>Risks &amp; Challenges</i></h3>
<p>As far as ""risks and challenges"" on this project, there really aren't any big ones. I've already paid for all the work to date, the album is 3/4 recorded and already sounded pretty lovely, and if this campaign doesn't fully fund the remaining costs, I won't give up! By hook or by crook I will raise and spend the money necessary to finish it, and finish it well. That is my commitment, and God willing, this album will be publicly available while 2017 still offers warm weather in the northern hemisphere.</p>
</div><div><h3><i>Other Ways You Can Help</i></h3></div><p>And finally: whether you are able to contribute monetarily or not, you can definitely help this project by <strong>spreading the word amongst <i>your</i> community</strong> and <strong>sharing on social media ( <a href=""https://www.igg.me/at/adambauer2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.igg.me/at/adambauer2</a> </strong>)<strong> </strong>to help us get the word out there. Many thanks for your good thoughts and help--I bow to you!</p><p>See you out on the bhajan trail,</p><p>Adam</p></div>","The Project
I'm Adam Bauer and I've been singing and playing sacred music for 30+ years. In 2014 I released a partially crowd-funded sacred chant album, Shyam Lila--which was a critically acclaimed success and one of the true honors of my life. I remain humbled and grateful for everyone who helped bring that into form!
Now I am back in the studio working on the next album, this time with renowned producer Ben Leinbach.
I am profoundly grateful for the support I've felt (from the Universe and from humans) these last years as I've traveled all over the world offering these devotional chants through my own voice.

In keeping with a dance scene tradition, we commissioned 3 exclusive remixes from world class producers. This has grown into a whopper, sweetly named 'Charm EP'.

<h2>Hi friends!</h2>
<p>I’m singer-songwriter Jenny Bienemann, based in the Chicago area, member of the bands The Zimmerman, The Significant Others, and The Rainy Day Women.  I've taught songwriting at schools, community centers, and retreats.  I've produced three solo CDs, a live CD with my husband Robin Bienemann, and have been very fortunate to have a number of my songs featured in TV, radio, and theatre.  </p>
<h2>What's new?</h2>
<p>In recent years, the guitar has been in the background of my projects.   </p>

</div></div>","Hi friends!
I’m singer-songwriter Jenny Bienemann, based in the Chicago area, member of the bands The Zimmerman, The Significant Others, and The Rainy Day Women.  I've taught songwriting at schools, community centers, and retreats.  I've produced three solo CDs, a live CD with my husband Robin Bienemann, and have been very fortunate to have a number of my songs featured in TV, radio, and theatre.  
What's new?
In recent years, the guitar has been in the background of my projects.   
  
My most recent solo CD, ""Heading Slowly Towards the Beginning,"" was supported by the Illinois Arts Council, featured a string quartet, and was recognized as one of the year’s top albums by local DJs, with WXRT's Local Anesthetic heralding it as ""simply striking in its fluidity and charm.""  The album before that, ""Girl Friday,"" didn't even have a guitar on it!  It was recorded live during rush hour in the Ogilvie Transportation Center in Chicago with  my voice, kalimba, and a looper, earning accolades from TimeOut Chicago and the Illinois Entertainer.
  
What's new is that my brand new, upcoming CD, ""Every Soul Grows to the Light,” marks my return home to my first love, the acoustic, finger style guitar!
  
I need you!
YES, you!  I need your help.
I have a track record of successfully producing ambitious projects on tight budgets.  Yet, even with the generosity of the artists and artisans, all of whom are working at  below-market rates, my vision exceeds my personal resources on this project.

<p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>My name is Cory Matthews and I have been making music for over 10 years. I have been working hard to perfect my craft and make music that I am proud of. I have worked with some incredible artists and really want a chance to finally put out my own music to the world. I have been working on my new album ""Boy Meets World"" for over 2 years now and have finally narrowed down the album to 10 songs. Writing this album has been a journey of self discovery for me. I have really grown a lot through this writing process and have finally discovered who I want to be as an artist.</p>
<p>Your support of this campaign will mean that I finally get to share my passion with each and every one of you. Everyone who has heard demo's of the project have fallen in love with the heart and the soul that has gone into it, and I just want to be able to share that same emotion with the rest of the world.</p>

<p>  We are Eb &amp; Flow. We are currently set out to record our new album ""The Great Wave"" Parts 3 &amp; 4 @ the Saltmine Recording Studios in Phoenix AZ starting January 2017. It has always been a dream of ours to sit back and play music hands free without the recording technology interfering with our creative process. We love working in the studio and all of our writing and recordings our done by ourselves. We would like to take our music up to the Next Level and have our recordings professionally handled. This has been a dream of ours for a long time now, and it will allow us to go in to the studio and channel our energy directly to the music to create new sounds and emotions pure from our being. We feel strongly about a lot of the Improvisational songs we have done and want to channel and capture that energy in this new album. We currently are booked for 2 days in this studio. But this will only allow us to get half of the album done. We are looking for help to get a couple more days covered to finish the tracking and mastering of this new album. Along the journey we will be creating a DVD of the recording sessions ,travel, music, friends, and life to accompany the newest album. We hope to involve everyone who has helped support ""The Great Wave"" along the way and invite them to join us further as we delve further into the multiple dimensions of music. </p>
<p>Music connects us, it heals us, music is meditation, it is relaxation. Without these a forms of connection the human race can not fully understand life. It is necessary for us to have these things we are passionate about. Because without them we will forget what it feels like to be human. It is our task to remember. Does it really matter why we are here? All that matters is every second is a recollection of ourselves, it is a fragment in time, Something to be remembered. It is our task to enjoy it! What ever it is that makes you happy! Do it! Make it happen. Music is one of those passions for us.</p>
<p>Studio time: We'll be booking time in the studio with enough flexibility to make sure nothing is rushed.<br/>Mixing<br/>Mastering<br/>Guest Musicians: None of the band are getting paid to work on this record, but we hope to hire some exceptional professionals to give the final touch.<br/>Production: Saltmine Engineers<br/>Artwork<br/>Physical CD production</p>

<h3>Kort &amp; bondig</h3>
<p>Iedereen heeft die ene uitlaatklep. Een droom om te realiseren. Een passie om na te jagen. Dit album is dat van mij. Als ondernemer, vader en echtgenoot is mijn work-life balans een enorme evenwichtsoefening. Mijn muziek helpt mij om stoom af te laten. Het helpt mij om mijn batterijen weer op te laden en mijn creatieve geest op scherp te zetten. Die muziek komt trouwens in verschillende vormen. Je kent me misschien al van:</p>
<ul>
<li><u><a href=""http://www.wednesdaynightjams.be/boxs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">De Wednesday Night Jams </a></u></li>
<li><u><a href=""http://degrungblavers.be/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">De Grungblavers</a></u></li>
<li><u><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCxpoGMAHD0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Voice Semi-Finalist</a></u></li>
</ul>
<p>Maar nu is het tijd voor een eigen solo album. </p>

</div><div>
<h3>Over het album:</h3>
<p>Het album heet 'Slower, smaller, happier'. Het is een album gebaseerd op 'goesting'. Met talent van hier en <i>songs</i> van eigen maak. De nummers gaan over het leven. Over fictie. Over de realiteit. Het is een <i>funky</i> plaat. Met dansbare <i>songs. </i>Het is nog in de maak, maar hier kan je alvast een eerste song beluisteren en gratis downloaden! </p>

</div><div>
<h3>Waarom heb ik jou nodig?</h3>
<p>Een eigen album opnemen kost tijd. Veel tijd én geld. Niet enkel voor mij, maar ook voor alle mensen die mij helpen bij de opnames. De eerste rekeningen heb ik zelf betaald. Het is tenslotte mijn droom. Maar als ik het goed wil doen, als ik het album juist wil laten klinken, heb ik hulp nodig. Ik heb jouw hulp nodig. Het grootste deel van deze campagne gaat naar het <i>producen</i> en <i>mixen</i> van het album. Dat is noodzakelijk voor een professionele <i>sound.</i> De rest van het ingezamelde geld gaat naar allerlei zaken die nodig zijn om het album te realiseren zoals ik het in mijn hoofd heb zitten.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Waar gaat je geld naartoe?</h3>
<p>Om te laten zien dat ik het écht meen, wil ik heel transparant zijn. Elke euro die gestort wordt, gaat naar het realiseren van mijn droom. Jouw bijdrage gaat dus rechtstreeks naar één van de vele stappen in het proces:</p>

Kort & bondig
Iedereen heeft die ene uitlaatklep. Een droom om te realiseren. Een passie om na te jagen. Dit album is dat van mij. Als ondernemer, vader en echtgenoot is mijn work-life balans een enorme evenwichtsoefening. Mijn muziek helpt mij om stoom af te laten. Het helpt mij om mijn batterijen weer op te laden en mijn creatieve geest op scherp te zetten. Die muziek komt trouwens in verschillende vormen. Je kent me misschien al van:

De Wednesday Night Jams 
De Grungblavers
The Voice Semi-Finalist

Maar nu is het tijd voor een eigen solo album. 


Over het album:
Het album heet 'Slower, smaller, happier'. Het is een album gebaseerd op 'goesting'. Met talent van hier en songs van eigen maak. De nummers gaan over het leven. Over fictie. Over de realiteit. Het is een funky plaat. Met dansbare songs. Het is nog in de maak, maar hier kan je alvast een eerste song beluisteren en gratis downloaden! 
>> Cassiers: Shackles & Chains <<


Waarom heb ik jou nodig?
Een eigen album opnemen kost tijd. Veel tijd én geld. Niet enkel voor mij, maar ook voor alle mensen die mij helpen bij de opnames. De eerste rekeningen heb ik zelf betaald. Het is tenslotte mijn droom. Maar als ik het goed wil doen, als ik het album juist wil laten klinken, heb ik hulp nodig. Ik heb jouw hulp nodig. Het grootste deel van deze campagne gaat naar het producen en mixen van het album. Dat is noodzakelijk voor een professionele sound. De rest van het ingezamelde geld gaat naar allerlei zaken die nodig zijn om het album te realiseren zoals ik het in mijn hoofd heb zitten.

 
Waar gaat je geld naartoe?
Om te laten zien dat ik het écht meen, wil ik heel transparant zijn. Elke euro die gestort wordt, gaat naar het realiseren van mijn droom. Jouw bijdrage gaat dus rechtstreeks naar één van de vele stappen in het proces:

 
Wat krijg je in ruil voor een bijdrage?
Elke bijdrage telt. Groot én klein. Je kan op deze pagina kiezen uit verschillende 'perks' van €5 tot €2.500. Wat je ook kiest, er staat altijd een beloning tegenover om mijn dankbaarheid te tonen. 
 

De risico's
Wat er ook gebeurt, mijn avontuur gaat verder. Ook als deze campagne haar doel niet bereikt. Never stop chasing your dream, right?  Het ingezamelde geld gaat hoe dan ook naar het album. Stel dat deze campagne enorm succesvol is, dan komen er nieuwe 'perks' bij. Dat geld gaat naar extra's en naar de oorspronkelijke onkosten die reeds zijn betaald.

Je kan ook op een andere manier helpen
Verspreid de blijde boodschap. Wil je liever niet financieel steunen? Even goede vrienden. Maar deel deze pagina dan met je vrienden en familie. Misschien willen zij een bijdrage leveren?

We are not responsible for the causes that make us unhappy, we are not guilty even when we look around and see things we don't like or don't agree with.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Drive By Wire has been rocking for over 10 years! Starting with the release of our brand new single 'Blood Red Moon' we've finetuned our unique heavy-rock sound, and now we want to record our 4th full-length album fulll of new kickass material.... The days that recordlabels payed the bills for studio-costs, producers, mixing and mastering are long gone......bands have to cough that money up themselves..</p>
<p> We  decided to take matters into our own and your hands and want to raise money for the new album together with  fans, friends and family who have helped keep this band  going all these years. Throughout the years , we've released 3 full length albums, toured all over Europe, and pretty much lived and breathed this music as long as we've been around....</p>
<p>We are an independent band ( although backed up by a small but very good Indie/stonerrock recordcompany for distribution) free from obligations and want to be in control of our 'careers'. Crowdfunding seems to be the way to go nowadays... it's a way that supporters of this kind of music/ Drive By Wire  know exactly where their hard earned money is going. No middlemen, no commissions, no greedy managers, no bullshit.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Over the last couple months, we watched other bands use this method and actually succeed. There have been many different approaches and fans of music are starting to understand this format.</p>
<p>T<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>he success of this campaign will determine how amazing this record will become. We are set up for Flex Funding which means if we don't reach our goal, we are still getting the money that is raised. So, if we don't reach our goal, we will have to reevaluate how we are planning to do this record. Regardless, we are ready to deliver this thing however our campaign plays out.</span></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Every time we've headed into the studio in the past, we've kept all the people who have supported Drive By Wire in mind. But, the level of responsibility is so much higher this time.</p>
<p>With that in mind, we give you our word that we will not settle for 'good enough' - we wont take any shortcuts, and above all – the money we raise in this thing will be reflected in the final product.</p>
<p>Lets raise our glasses to making our best album yet... Hell Yeah!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you want to support us, but can't miss the cash – there are other ways you can help out;  Spread the word! Tell your family and friends and let them know what's going on. We don't expect everyone who digs our music to jump on board, just let people know this is happening. With all the social networking and ways we now connect with one another, by posting links of this crowdfunding-campaign you are reaching places we would never be able to reach..... So, let's spread the word, and lets make this happen together!  Cheers!</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Drive By Wire has been rocking for over 10 years! Starting with the release of our brand new single 'Blood Red Moon' we've finetuned our unique heavy-rock sound, and now we want to record our 4th full-length album fulll of new kickass material.... The days that recordlabels payed the bills for studio-costs, producers, mixing and mastering are long gone......bands have to cough that money up themselves..
 We  decided to take matters into our own and your hands and want to raise money for the new album together with  fans, friends and family who have helped keep this band  going all these years. Throughout the years , we've released 3 full length albums, toured all over Europe, and pretty much lived and breathed this music as long as we've been around....
We are an independent band ( although backed up by a small but very good Indie/stonerrock recordcompany for distribution) free from obligations and want to be in control of our 'careers'. Crowdfunding seems to be the way to go nowadays... it's a way that supporters of this kind of music/ Drive By Wire  know exactly where their hard earned money is going. No middlemen, no commissions, no greedy managers, no bullshit.

What We Need & What You Get
Over the last couple months, we watched other bands use this method and actually succeed. There have been many different approaches and fans of music are starting to understand this format.
The success of this campaign will determine how amazing this record will become. We are set up for Flex Funding which means if we don't reach our goal, we are still getting the money that is raised. So, if we don't reach our goal, we will have to reevaluate how we are planning to do this record. Regardless, we are ready to deliver this thing however our campaign plays out.

The Impact
Every time we've headed into the studio in the past, we've kept all the people who have supported Drive By Wire in mind. But, the level of responsibility is so much higher this time.
With that in mind, we give you our word that we will not settle for 'good enough' - we wont take any shortcuts, and above all – the money we raise in this thing will be reflected in the final product.
Lets raise our glasses to making our best album yet... Hell Yeah!

Other Ways You Can Help
If you want to support us, but can't miss the cash – there are other ways you can help out;  Spread the word! Tell your family and friends and let them know what's going on. We don't expect everyone who digs our music to jump on board, just let people know this is happening. With all the social networking and ways we now connect with one another, by posting links of this crowdfunding-campaign you are reaching places we would never be able to reach..... So, let's spread the word, and lets make this happen together!  Cheers!

It is with glowing pride that Nelumbo Records presents to you SHAK’s Debut EP pre-release Tour 2018. Shak’thiya has been a Nelumbo Artist since early 2017. Most people know him by his stage name, SHAK. Nelumbo Records is an independent Singapore-based Record Label that focuses on soul, funk, jazz and groove music. To put it simply, we are dedicated to the groove. Our mission is to foster emerging and established artists in discovering and amplifying their unique sound.</p><p>Nelumbo records and SHAK are delighted to share with you his music from his debut EP entitled ‘Sitting at Home’. With that, we are planning to do an EP pre-release tour to Manila, Sydney and Melbourne.</p><p>To do a music tour, there is a notable amount of expense, which includes Promotions, Travel, Lodging, Equipment Rental and Food. The music business is always growing and evolving to meet the needs of the listeners. Not so long ago, music artists had to perform live shows for their music to be known and develop their fan-base. Kudos to the internet, artists now have used Youtube as a justifying platform to gain popularity amongst a virtual fan-base. However, even though it is an effective approach to gaining fans and industry attention, this virtual stage does not assure that an artist is a good live performer. Having access to various means of recording equipment and an intelligent studio engineer helps internet music artists gain more legitimacy, but at some point, standing in the crowd and being a part of the live performance is an experience that can not be replicated via a YouTube video.</p><p>So YES, we would like to humbly seek your help in making this dream tour happen. If you have read this far, thank you so much! You are totally awesome and we want you to know that we really  and truly appreciate your support. We are aware that your time is valuable, and so we will elaborate to the best that we can within the brief description below.</p><p>Our goal for this campaign is to present SHAK’s music on an international stage.

<p><strong>The Ventriloquist Mute's new album ""Revenant""</strong></p>
<p>While I have enjoyed making music for many years, this is the first album that I really put a deeply personal and private part of myself into. I have struggled with addiction, as have many close friends and family members, and this album is my story.</p>
<ul>
<li>My dad gave me my first guitar when I was 16 and things slowly developed from that moment.</li>
<li>This album is deeply personal to me and tells a story that a lot of people can relate to.</li>
<li>I make music as a personal hobby, and as such I do not have corporate backing to help fund the printing, marketing, and distribution of my music. </li>
</ul>
<p>I am hoping that those who enjoy my music and want to support a meaningful project will contribute in whatever way they can and enjoy the high quality product they get in return.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The printing of 100 physical copies of the album and 100 11x17 posters will cost $405 dollars; this is where most of the funding is going. The remaining funding goal amount will cover the printing of the t-shirts and distribution on iTunes, google music, etc.</li>
<li>I tried to make the perks the things that I would want if I were backing an independent band's project: hard copies of the album, posters, and t-shirts. </li>
<li>I am prepared to dedicate whatever amount of my personal money is needed towards fulfilling funding gaps should this campaign not cover the full cost of printing. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Label backed music has become so highly corporatized that there is little room left for creative experimentation out of fear of reduced profit margin and angry stock holder meetings. Crowdfunding gives the power back to both artists and the consumer to make and enjoy something that is unique and inspiring. </li>
<li>I crowdfunded my previous album on Kickstarter successfully and verified that all backers received their promised rewards on time. I am not one to leave a project unfinished: especially one as deeply personal and important to me as this. </li>
<li>I love making music and I hope to reach as many people as possible who may enjoy my music. If even just one person finds meaning or inspiration in my music, then I consider my project a resounding success. Anything more is just icing on the cake!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>I would imagine this is a pretty low risk campaign for backers because I have a modest funding target, realistic goals, and lots of experience in making albums independently. The main risk would be a 30-60 day delay in printing the albums/posters/t-shirts so that I can save up enough of my own money to pay for the printing. This would certainly be a burden but I am prepared to do whatever is necessary to make this album happen</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>

</div></div>","The Ventriloquist Mute's new album ""Revenant""
While I have enjoyed making music for many years, this is the first album that I really put a deeply personal and private part of myself into. I have struggled with addiction, as have many close friends and family members, and this album is my story.

My dad gave me my first guitar when I was 16 and things slowly developed from that moment.
This album is deeply personal to me and tells a story that a lot of people can relate to.
I make music as a personal hobby, and as such I do not have corporate backing to help fund the printing, marketing, and distribution of my music. 

I am hoping that those who enjoy my music and want to support a meaningful project will contribute in whatever way they can and enjoy the high quality product they get in return.
What We Need & What You Get

The printing of 100 physical copies of the album and 100 11x17 posters will cost $405 dollars; this is where most of the funding is going. The remaining funding goal amount will cover the printing of the t-shirts and distribution on iTunes, google music, etc.
I tried to make the perks the things that I would want if I were backing an independent band's project: hard copies of the album, posters, and t-shirts. 
I am prepared to dedicate whatever amount of my personal money is needed towards fulfilling funding gaps should this campaign not cover the full cost of printing. 

The Impact

Label backed music has become so highly corporatized that there is little room left for creative experimentation out of fear of reduced profit margin and angry stock holder meetings. Crowdfunding gives the power back to both artists and the consumer to make and enjoy something that is unique and inspiring. 
I crowdfunded my previous album on Kickstarter successfully and verified that all backers received their promised rewards on time. I am not one to leave a project unfinished: especially one as deeply personal and important to me as this. 
I love making music and I hope to reach as many people as possible who may enjoy my music. If even just one person finds meaning or inspiration in my music, then I consider my project a resounding success. Anything more is just icing on the cake!

Risks & Challenges
I would imagine this is a pretty low risk campaign for backers because I have a modest funding target, realistic goals, and lots of experience in making albums independently. The main risk would be a 30-60 day delay in printing the albums/posters/t-shirts so that I can save up enough of my own money to pay for the printing. This would certainly be a burden but I am prepared to do whatever is necessary to make this album happen
Other Ways You Can Help
For an independent artist the hardest thing is getting the word out about your project. 

Taking a few minutes of your time to stream my music (it's free!) and let me know what you think is immensely helpful.
If you like my music or think you know someone who would like it, share it around! Social media is hugely beneficial to artists in my position and empowers you the listener to connect directly with the artist (me!)
Like my Facebook page and connect with me! I love to chat with fellow music lovers and genuinely appreciate feedback, even if it's critical.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Charleston Civic Chorus has a 66-year tradition of providing quality choral performances for the greater Charleston area FREE OF CHARGE.  We depend on funding from this campaign along with corporate and private contributions, grants, and sponsorships to offset part of our operating expenses, salaries, fees for guest performers, music scores, concert hall rent, program printing and advertising. </p>
<p>Your contribution to this campaign is extremely important to us and will be greatly appreciated.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise $2,000 from this campaign to cover the fees for our guest performers, their sound engineer, and a portion of our expenses for advertising, venue rental, insurance, music scores, and salaries of our Artistic Director/Conductor and our Accompanist.</p>
<p>If we do not reach our campaign goal the performance will still go on, but with somewhat reduced funds for additional performances in 2018.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By offering this performance to the greater Charleston, West Virginia area FREE OF CHARGE, everyone can come and enjoy an evening of quality choral performance regardless of their financial status.</p>
<p>Now in our 66th year, The Charleston Civic Chorus has established a relationship with the community in which we can be trusted to present wholesome programs suitable for all family members.</p>
<p>We have had a successful track record with crowdfunding including a previous campaign to bring renowned Canadian composer Eleanor Daley to Charleston, WV for an afternoon of her reflective and evocative music. Ms. Daley accompanied The Charleston Civic Chorus on piano and organ, on a concert that included 18 of her compositions.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>It is always a challenge to present a widely varying range of choral music that will attract and appeal to the varying interests of the community.  To that end, our Artistic Director and Conductor organizes the repertoire for each performance around a central theme with diverse forms of choral music that relate to that theme, along with his insights and excellent commentary in the concert programs. Enhancing the appeal of this 90-minute performance will be a 25-minute independent set by our guest artists, the Mountain Thyme Appalachian Ensemble, including a piece that combines the voices and instrumentalists of both the Charleston Civic Chorus and the Mountain Thyme Ensemble.</p>

<h3>Who Are The Vocal Blue Trains?</h3>
<p>We are a choir of vocalists who create and rearrange contemporary music with an incredible pop-blues-jazz sound mixed with traditional gospel and modern electronic music. Although we've been active for just under 2 years, the project has gained national and international acclaim in more than 40 performances across Italy and Europe, including the Prague International Choral Meeting 2016 and the Wien International Choir Festival 2017.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why We Need Your Support...</h3>

Yep, that means our total amounts to €35,000 euros. Wowza!</p>
<p>We're doing all we can to fundraise, so here on Indiegogo, our goal is <strong>€12.000 euro</strong>. </p>
<h3>PA (Pretty Awesome) Perks!</h3>
<p>To support our dream you will get our deepest gratitude! We will also be giving out awesome gifts to those who can help us lower the costs incurred for this trip, including:</p>

<p>My name is Hailey Mae Niswanger, I am a saxophonist, composer, vocalist, and lover. My passion for music has been the driving force of my life ever since I can remember. Throughout my childhood years I studied piano, clarinet, saxophone, flute and accordion. Saxophone became my main focus and upon graduating high school, I went on to attend Berklee College of Music to study Jazz Performance. During my freshman year of college, I released my first album, Confeddie (2009). After graduating, I moved to Brooklyn, where I began working as a professional musician, and released my second jazz album, The Keeper (2012). A few years later, I released my third album, a funk project titled PDX Soul (2015), thanks to a successfully funded crowd campaign. And while all these projects were representative of me at those times, I felt like I had yet to find the sound that was truly my purpose, and where I felt the most free. </p>
<p>So I started letting go of concepts, boxes, and genres that would tell me to write or play a certain way. I opened myself up to all the many different influences around me, and began recognizing our connection to all the life we see and beyond. Meditating on this, I let the music flow through me, without judgement, and found MAE.SUN. This is the most honest, and real I have ever felt with my music, and I believe it's music for the world, intended to help us be free and conscious of the interdependent nature of reality. </p>
<p>Last December we went into the studio to record Vol. 1: Inter-be. The album features Nikara Warren on the vibraphone, Andrew Renfroe on guitar, Axel Laugart on keys, Aaron Liao on bass, David Frazier Jr. on drums, and I am on soprano sax and vocals. But releasing an album is not easy. It takes months of preparation before and after the recording. It costs a great amount to pay for the studio time and engineer, the musicians, the mixing and mastering of the album, as well as the expenses for pressing the album, the visuals, distribution, and promotion. </p>
<p>I have been able to budget on expenses so far, but I am in honest need of help to complete the first volume, in addition to recording and releasing the second. If this campaign is successfully funded with $15,000, it would help both of these projects come to fruition. In exchange for your donations, you would receive digital and autographed hard copies of Vol. 1, stickers, T-shirts, a poster of the album art work done by the talented Anna Lise Holly, handmade dream catchers, Skype lessons, VIP tickets to a future concert, a cover recording song of choice, or an original composition. </p>
<p>It is my dream to release as much honest music as possible, and to make this world a better place through the music. Your contribution will help this music thrive; and in a world with so much separation, fear, and pain, I believe that it is a necessary reminder to be love. Any amount is extremely helpful, and if you are unable to contribute financially but still believe in our music and message, we would greatly appreciate your help in spreading the word to your community about this project.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Karel Ruzicka and I am a saxophone player, composer, producer and educator based in New York City. I perform and record regularly with my groups as a leader and as a sideman I worked with legendary musicians such as Michael Franks, George Benson, Ravi Coltrane, Roy Hargrove, Ben E. King (he wrote and first recorded the hit R&amp;B classic ""Stand By Me"") , Arturo Sandoval, Dean Brown, Mike Stern, Reggie Young and many others. I am also a frequent guest artist at the Jazz at the Lincoln Center as well as a band member at the Times Square Church.</p>
<p>This upcoming musical offering is called ""Grace and Gratitude"". This title reflects how positively transformative experiencing grace and responding with gratitude can be. Grace makes things seemingly impossible, possible. And gratitude brings into our life true joy and more things to be grateful for. This is the theme and inspiration for the compositions on this album. Music has so much healing power and my chief aim is to help bring joy and healing among us through the tunes on this album. </p>
<p>The group that I have put together for this special project is a true dream team. Pianist Jon Cowherd is a member of the Brian Blade Fellowship and also performed with Norah Jones, Cassandra Willson, Iggy Pop and many others. Bassist John Patitucci can be heard with Chick Corea Elektric Band, Wayne Shorter Quartet and did work with Herbie Hancock, Sting, Michael Brecker, Joe Lovano and the list goes on. Drummer Nate Smith has just received a Grammy nomination for a composition ""Home Free"" from his album KINFOLK-Postcards from Everywhere. He has toured and recorded with Dave Holland, Chris Potter, Ravi Coltrane, Regina Carter, Nicholas Payton and others.</p>
<p>Once again, it is my great pleasure to invite you on this incredible journey with me. Your contributions will help me bring this music to life (and to you).  Moreover, it will be performed and recorded by some of the finest musicians and recording engineers in the world.  This is a big deal and together we are about to make it possible!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Budget</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I am very excited about this album and about the musicians, producers and engineers I will be working with to bring this project to life. Making an album is not only a lot of work, but there are many necessary expenses required to create a quality product. This is what $19,750 will pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Musicians</li>
<li>Studio Engineers</li>
<li>Rehearsal Studio</li>
<li>Recording Studio</li>
<li>Mixing, Mastering</li>
<li>CD Artwork/Design</li>
<li>CD Manufacturing</li>
</ul>
<p>For your contributions you will receive rewards ranging from digital downloads, physical CD's, photos/videos,  to your name in the booklet or executive producer credit to more interactive experiences such as online lessons and private in-house concerts (only in NYC Metro Area, Philadelphia,Washington DC,NJ,CT,MA or with all travel expenses covered extra if you are in CA or elsewhere in the US) The live concert option is only available in the USA. The personnel will include top musicians from the NY jazz scene.</p>
<p>Your funds will go towards releasing this project even if we raise less funds than our entire goal. However the number of tracks on the album and album release date might be affected because of the time constraints caused by reduced funding.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Your contribution to this project will provide you with high quality music and the inside look into various aspects of the creative process. All my recordings as both a leader and sideman up to date received awards and nominations and great reviews. Become a part of yet another success!  </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We will record on June 5 and 6, 2018 and mixing/mastering will proceed subsequently. We expect a release date by the end of October 2018 on the Czech independent label Animal Music <a href=""https://animalmusic.cz/en?switch=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://animalmusic.cz/en?switch=1</a>.</p>
<p>The studio, musicians and rehearsal space have already been booked. Music always has challenges such as meeting all the various deadlines and other unforeseen circumstances. But the team I have in place to see this project through to its completion makes all risks and challenges easy to overcome. We got you covered!</p>
<p>  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you are in no position to contribute financially, you can still help us make this happen. We will greatly appreciate if you spread the word and make some buzz about this campaign. Send an email with a link to your friends and do not forget to take advantage of all the available Indiegogo share tools. </p>

I am also a frequent guest artist at the Jazz at the Lincoln Center as well as a band member at the Times Square Church.
This upcoming musical offering is called ""Grace and Gratitude"". This title reflects how positively transformative experiencing grace and responding with gratitude can be. Grace makes things seemingly impossible, possible. And gratitude brings into our life true joy and more things to be grateful for. This is the theme and inspiration for the compositions on this album. Music has so much healing power and my chief aim is to help bring joy and healing among us through the tunes on this album. 
The group that I have put together for this special project is a true dream team. Pianist Jon Cowherd is a member of the Brian Blade Fellowship and also performed with Norah Jones, Cassandra Willson, Iggy Pop and many others. Bassist John Patitucci can be heard with Chick Corea Elektric Band, Wayne Shorter Quartet and did work with Herbie Hancock, Sting, Michael Brecker, Joe Lovano and the list goes on. Drummer Nate Smith has just received a Grammy nomination for a composition ""Home Free"" from his album KINFOLK-Postcards from Everywhere. He has toured and recorded with Dave Holland, Chris Potter, Ravi Coltrane, Regina Carter, Nicholas Payton and others.
Once again, it is my great pleasure to invite you on this incredible journey with me. Your contributions will help me bring this music to life (and to you).  Moreover, it will be performed and recorded by some of the finest musicians and recording engineers in the world.  This is a big deal and together we are about to make it possible!
 

 
Budget
 
I am very excited about this album and about the musicians, producers and engineers I will be working with to bring this project to life. Making an album is not only a lot of work, but there are many necessary expenses required to create a quality product. This is what $19,750 will pay for:

Musicians
Studio Engineers
Rehearsal Studio
Recording Studio
Mixing, Mastering
CD Artwork/Design
CD Manufacturing

For your contributions you will receive rewards ranging from digital downloads, physical CD's, photos/videos,  to your name in the booklet or executive producer credit to more interactive experiences such as online lessons and private in-house concerts (only in NYC Metro Area, Philadelphia,Washington DC,NJ,CT,MA or with all travel expenses covered extra if you are in CA or elsewhere in the US) The live concert option is only available in the USA. The personnel will include top musicians from the NY jazz scene.
Your funds will go towards releasing this project even if we raise less funds than our entire goal. However the number of tracks on the album and album release date might be affected because of the time constraints caused by reduced funding.

 
The Impact
 
Your contribution to this project will provide you with high quality music and the inside look into various aspects of the creative process. All my recordings as both a leader and sideman up to date received awards and nominations and great reviews. Become a part of yet another success!  

 
Risks & Challenges
We will record on June 5 and 6, 2018 and mixing/mastering will proceed subsequently. We expect a release date by the end of October 2018 on the Czech independent label Animal Music https://animalmusic.cz/en?switch=1.
The studio, musicians and rehearsal space have already been booked. Music always has challenges such as meeting all the various deadlines and other unforeseen circumstances. But the team I have in place to see this project through to its completion makes all risks and challenges easy to overcome. We got you covered!

<p><strong>ARTIST BIO AND MUSIC - KYEKYEKU (GHANA)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kyekyeku </strong>is described by CNN AFRICAN VOICES as a<strong> ‘Wizard with a Guitar’</strong>. A Ghanaian musician whose acoustic and electric guitars sounds, intricate percussive groove and lush horns defines a style that carries a distinctive Ghanaian sound and image locked between folk and a throbbing urban highlife beat. Kyekyeku is seen as a new generation of young lively Ghanaian musicians that is combining musical traditions from roots <strong>PALMWINE </strong>(a style of Ghanaian folk) <strong>HIGHLIFE </strong>and <strong>AFROBEAT</strong>; performing live in new and exciting sounds. <br/>The young Ghanaian musician has collaborated with world-renowned musicians including Peter White (UK/Jazz), Thais Morel (Brazil), Mayra Andrade (Cape Verde), Blick Bassy (Cameroun), Ebo Taylor (Ghana), Pat Thomas (Ghana), Atongo Zimba (Ghana) and played same stage as Bob James and Earl klugh.</p>

<h3>WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP:</h3>
<p>Kyekyeku seeks to bring his group on tour as their next stage of development and views music festivals across Africa as great way to meet a wider live audience and share the results of hard word through great music and fun in addition to calling attention to the various dysfunctionalites in Africa which is a central theme in Kyekyeku’s music with the hope of contributing to finding solutions.</p>
<p>This year the band performed outside of Ghana at MASA Festival; which is one of Africa’s biggest arts and spectacles expo held in La Cote D’Ivoire where several agents and promoters attend to book acts. The band’s performance and music at MASA caught the eye of other agents, who extended invitations to perform at other festivals thereafter. Consequently, Kyekyeku has been invited at the annual Visa For Music expo in Rabat, Morocco.</p>
<p>For the last 2 years Kyekyeku and his band have worked hard and been invited on several musical events and stages in Accra’s live music scene. The band is one of the most frequently seen playing their own compositions of re-visited Highlife and Afrobeat styles from Ghana.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Roy's Story </strong></h3>
<p>As one of 12 children, Roy spent most of his childhood growing up on a farm in a small town in Arkansas.  Roy enjoyed school, helping his father with farming, and he started singing in the church choir at the age of 8. Roy took on most of the farming duties when his father became disabled by a stroke when he was only 13 years old.  The family moved to California in the early 60's . Roy joined the Army in 1966 and was stationed in Germany as a track vehicle mechanic in the 3rd armored div.  After his time in the military Roy decided to travel Europe to broaden his mind and creative spirits.  In 1971 He moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in entertainment and kept studying his craft at LACC.  Roy finally got his first big break when he won a role in the tony award-winning Broadway musical Dreamgirls.  He spent over four years touring the world performing eight shows a week.  When the show ended Roy became a family man.  To provide for his family he took a job as a mechanic at the U.S postal service, and for years he worked the graveyard shift in order to continue pursuing his creative passions to have time to spend with his family.  Over the years Roy has played in several roots and R &amp;B bands with some of them getting to open for more prolific artists.  Now at 69 Roy is going to take the spotlight.<br/><br/> </p>
<h3><strong>Album BIO</strong></h3>
<p>The album “Devil’s in the Whiskey” is a roots meets modern approach to a variety of genres while keeping the themes connected. The album starts and ends with an original recording of a chain gang and is the re-occurring theme throughout the album. The songs range from late 1800’s all the way up to current modern production. The album was recorded at Studio 1916 in Kyle TX. It’s a beautiful old Victorian style home that was built in 1916 and has been renovated to become a recording studio while preserving it’s historical integrity. In the recording process of the album, producers Travis Kennedy and Blake Atwell took special care and attention to detail, in using time period correct instruments and gear that would have been used in the original recordings within the themes throughout the album. It’s an album that takes you on a journey through time while keeping a roots theme throughout.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Why we need your HELP!</strong></h3>
<p>The album is completely finished and we have poured hundreds of hours and time, and personal money to complete this passion project. Why we need your help is to be able to keep the ball rolling with a campaign for PR/Marketing, Manufacturing, and distribution costs.  By contributing you are becoming our record label and only with your help, we can make this album get the recognition we feel it deserves.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What you'll get that nobody else will!</strong></h3>
<p>By pre-ordering from this campaign, not only will you get the album ahead of the rest of the world, and at a discount, but also included are several exclusive packages that will only be made for this campaign. From a CD with exclusive artwork, all the way to a custom finished wooden box that will contain a bottle of whiskey, a cigar, signed and numbered vinyl with exclusive artwork, digital download included, T-shirt, Hat, signed poster, and photo book. Only 50 vinyl records will ever be made for the artwork included in the ultimate package.  Anything helps and we all know that nobody is paying for music these days, but try to think of it this way. You could forego a few cups of coffee from Starbucks and have a tangible piece of art that you can keep forever.  You would also be changing our lives in helping to make this a success. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Your Impact</h3>With enough help, we will be able to afford a PR/Marketing campaign to get this album to a much larger audience.  When you hear Roy Lee Jones on the radio, you can say to yourself, I made that happen.  There's a ton of expenses outside of producing, recording, mixing, and mastering an album.  We need radio campaigns, interviews with reputable music writers and magazines, show booking agents, web development, social media marketing.... The list goes on forever and your impact is integral to the success of this project. </div>
<div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our biggest fear, is that after putting in hundreds of hours of work into making such a great album, that only our close family and friends will know about it because we won't have the funding to get this album out to a broader audience. PR/Marketing cost will play a big factor in this.  We also want to give Roy the gift of traveling and sharing this to the world.  Travel/touring expenses for a new artist are not cheap and most new artists are just praying they break even. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that not everyone can afford maybe even a $10 digital download but that doesn't mean that you can't help!  Please spread the word about this in any way that you can and share this to all of your social media pages, send emails, and just yell about it at the top of your lungs.  We'll be doing the same!  Thanks a million to everyone that can help in even this way!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> We, Reese McHenry (Vocals, Guitar) and Stephen Gardner (aka The Fox, Drums) started a Raleigh-based rock and roll drums/guitar duo in February, 2017.</p>
<p>In July, 2017, we recorded a 4 song, 7"" record (EP) we are really proud of. Engineered and produced in Raleigh by the mighty Dave Bartholomew, in a building where one could buy a tombstone, we are anticipating the return of the actual record at the end of November. We are using our own money to finance the record, t-shirts and tours, and we could use your help by way of pre ordering this record for $10.00.  </p>
<p>We do not consider this band a hobby or a side project. We were meant to make music and we are taking steps to do this full time, for a living, forever. We largely use my songs (Reese) but Stephen, in addition to being a fantastic drummer, is a great arranger/songwriter/singer/guitar player. </p>
<p>We are on the fast track. We've done a 10 day east coast tour, we're doing another one at the end of October and continue to do shorter regional weekends and local shows.  We have both been in rock bands all of our adult lives and starting this duo has proven to be a wonderful and productive union. We are both fully committed and excited for this journey to continue. This band and these songs are  a way to see the world doing the thing we love best: making music that people relate to and enjoy. Once this record comes out, we plan to release it and tour in both the USA and Europe.</p>
<p>We're asking for pre orders, but of course anything is appreciated and will be put to great use. If you'd like to buy a fox t-shirt, please email me at rrmchenry007@gmail.com. They are 20.00 and you can pay by PayPal. Thanks!</p>

<h3>What am I all about?</h3>
<p>Hi, i'm Erin Mulcair, an Indie Pop musician from Edmonton, AB, Canada. This is my first full length album, and my dream is to share my music with the world. A bit about me! I have been writing a long time, and have always loved it, but never recorded an album.</p>
<p>I got really sick after my daughter was born, and it was such a wake up call! Life is short, life is beautiful... it was time to stop sitting around and waiting to record and realize my dream.</p>
<p>This music is compelling, illustrative, and story driven and it is so important to me that you get to hear it. You will allow me to share this with people all around the globe.</p>
<p>Being a do-it-yourself artist is so rewarding, but not without challenges.. especially financial ones!<strong> If every one of my Facebook fans gave even $5, we would surpass the goal and then some.</strong>  </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The entire project will cost $25,000 and I am asking for $10,000 worth of funding. The money will be used for mixing and mastering the music, CD artwork, publicist costs, and CD manufacturing. </p>
<p>For as little as $5, I will send you a thank you tweet.</p>
<p>For $50, I will send you a signed copy of the CD and a thank you note right to your door.</p>
<p>Is there a song you were hoping I would cover? For $300, I will record whatever song you want with piano and voice!</p>
<p>I am SUPER optimistic that with your help, we will reach our goal, but if we don't reach the goal, be 100% assured that your money will still go towards the costs listed above. </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Music moves all of us. It is the thing that you turn to when you are joyful, it is the thing we reach for when we are down and out. It bring us through all moments of life - singing lullabies to our little ones, walking down the aisle, blasting our favourite song in our first car. It connects all of us, and it is the soundtrack to our lives.</p>
<p>In an age where there is more music than you can shake a stick at, I want you to be able to have a new favourite, something that brings you through your day. A soundtrack that you want to put on during a glorious summer sunrise, or a cold winter day. </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As I said earlier on, it is risky being a do-it-yourself artist. It is costly, and because there is so much music out there, it is hard to know exactly how to make a big splash. I believe in this music, and not only the sound and the songs, but so much so that I have taken courses and created intensive plans and checklists to ensure its success. Working with a publicist is one of the best decisions I could have made, and it allows the album to get press locally as well as internationally. </p>
<p>Having already <strong>poured my savings into this project,</strong> you can be sure this is something I believe in with my whole heart, and that I will work to overcome each challenge through the proactive planning I have already set in motion.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can only do one thing, please share this with your social networks! Whether it is email, Facebook, Twitter, blogs, YouTube, wherever you may be. Thank you so much, and I can't wait for you to hear it. </p>

I feel in this season of my life God has given me vision to release songs that bring joy and freedom. Over the years, God has been captivating my heart and my gaze to fall more in love with Him. This project will display different aspects of who God is and his faithfulness towards us. I'm always in awe of sunrises and sunsets because it gives me a glimpse of His majestic ways. I believe God displays colors and light in the sky to give us a taste of what Heaven resembles. When Jesus returns, everyone will look towards the sky because he’s coming for His bride. I want to create music that shows light, depth and the beauty of God. It would mean the world to me if you could donate to this project because you would be partnering with the dream and promise that God as placed inside of me.  My prayer for this album is that through these songs people will come to the Lord, stand in awe of Him and forever praise Him.

This project will display different aspects of who God is and his faithfulness towards us. I'm always in awe of sunrises and sunsets because it gives me a glimpse of His majestic ways. I believe God displays colors and light in the sky to give us a taste of what Heaven resembles. When Jesus returns, everyone will look towards the sky because he’s coming for His bride. I want to create music that shows light, depth and the beauty of God. It would mean the world to me if you could donate to this project because you would be partnering with the dream and promise that God as placed inside of me.  My prayer for this album is that through these songs people will come to the Lord, stand in awe of Him and forever praise Him. Again, please donate to the project but more importantly pray for this new journey I'm embracing with the Lord. Thank you so much! What We Need I need to raise $15,000 to fund this project.

Scott Robinson and a special appearance by Cantor William Tiep.  LABOR DAY 1967 will be followed by Quartet Nouveau’s bravura performance of Beethoven’s String Quartet, Opus 18, Number 3.  Beckett, an accomplished classical pianist, loved Beethoven, likely admiring, as he would, the musical context where things fit together, reflecting a world striving for and perhaps achieving, as Beckett might put it “order.”  An ""order"" to be reflected and perhaps shattered by Beckett's attempt to strive for the same thing in IMAGINATION DEAD IMAGINE.WE NEED - Your support.  To cover the San Diego premiere, the Red Hen/Los Angeles performances, and the eventual CD, we need $20,000 to make all of our plans possible.  We're turning to our friends in hopes of raising at least $15,000 now so that we may be well on the way.  And, happily, because San Diego Rep is a 501(c)3 non-profit, all contributions will be tax-deductible.PLEASE - Join me, join San Diego Repertory Theatre, and join my friends in this exciting and very personal project, something that I’ve been dreaming about and wanting to share for over 30 years. RISKS & CHALLENGES - This is a very personal project, and I'm committed to making it happen despite the risk or the consequences.  I've never opened any project to crowd and internet funding, and have never asked for funding or help in this unique fashion - still, we hope this direct appeal from all of us - from San Diego Repertory Theatre, from Todd Salovey, Artistic Director of the Lipinsky Family San Diego Jewish Arts Festival, from Red Hen Press and all our collaborators - will inspire you to support us in any way that you can.  AND FINALLY - LOS ANGELES IN JULY! Yes, IMAGINATION DEAD IMAGINE has been invited to be part of a special event at the Broad Stage.  We are thrilled about this and very busy working out details to make the special performances on July 9 happen, when we will be part of a celebration of contemporary literature produced by Red Hen Press.  Quartet Nouveau and our designers will recreate the Beckett as the finale for this program - more details coming soon.  For those who may be interested in jump starting our Los Angeles performances with one major contribution, the boost that will send IMAGINATION DEAD IMAGINE to LA with enormous confidence, please see the final perk!OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP - We - the musicians, the designers, and all of the collaborators, are truly grateful for ANY size contribution. All of us will spread the word about this project - and any help that anyone can offer in that spirit would be great and much appreciated.  Please tell your friends.  In addition, please:Share this on online anyway you can with as many friends as you can, and in anyway that appeals or is convenient via e-mail, Facebook, twitter, etc.And please do contact us with any questions and feedback, we'd love to hear what you think of this exciting and unique project.THANKS TO ALL - Michael RothTodd Salovey, Artistic Director, Lipinsky Family San Diego Jewish Arts Festival, San Diego Repertory TheatreKate Gale, Red Hen Press * - “IMAGINATION DEAD IMAGINE” from SAMUEL BECKETT: The Complete Short Prose,  Copyright © 1995 by The Estate of Samuel Beckett.

<p><strong>Courage &amp; Suffrage</strong> is an album to celebrate two iconic women in Britain whose classical compositions inspired many in the suffrage movement. The amount of classical work composed by women represented in the modern society is far too little, whether it is in public performances or CD recordings. There exists an outstanding number of beautifully composed sonatas and sinfonias. Most of them were written in a time when women’s education and professional development were subject to limitations and discrimination. In deliberately under-representing women’s work, we have shifted more and more towards a gender biased industry, in which record companies bias towards male composers. We want to encourage recording companies to give female artists their fair share of our musical heritage.</p>
<p><br/>We hope that more and more people will become aware, study and appreciate the music of women and come to recognise composers like Smyth and Clarke as composers rather than women composers. We believe everyone deserves to be part of this movement, and this album is great first step towards realizing this vision of ours. Whether or not we can succeed depends entirely on your support and we need every bit of help that can be gathered.</p>

<p><strong><i>&lt;historical significance of the two featured composers, Smyth and Clarke&gt;</i></strong></p>
<p>In the late 19th century, British born Dame Ethel Smyth was the most successful and accomplished British composer of opera. She was awarded knighthood of the Order of British Empire in 1922, for her compositions and contributions to music. In fact, she is the first woman in Britain that was awarded a knighthood. Despite the recognition from the King, and her multiple doctorates from University of Durham and Oxford, her peers and crtics always regarded her as a ""woman composer"", rather than a ""composer"", and judged her harshly on the grounds of sounding like ""male composers"". After her death, her musical talents and legacy were not celebrated, as most scholars regarded her as an eccentric figure. However Ethel Smyth had been a figurehead for women’s rights in the 19th century, part of the suffrage movement. She wrote two cello sonatas, the first in A minor was published but the second one, in C minor was never published, though she got very close to it as I read her original manuscript, now stored in the British Library.</p>
<p>Rebecca Clarke, born and raised in London, whose most creative years coincided with the most intense period of the women's suffrage movement. Her career was patchy at best as she struggled to find herself amongst other composers and like Smyth, faced difficulty promoting her own work to critics and peers. Unlike Smyth though, she mostly chose to be silent instead of being a fighter for the suffrage movement. As a result many of her compositions were never published and her composition career came to a halt shortly after she got married. Nevertheless she acted with great courage to promote young women instrumentalists to perform her own compositions. Clarke is another example of a great composer that could have been much more had the world given her a chance, and after a lifetime of classical music, the recognition she received is much less than what she deserved. She composed her first sonata for viola in the iconic year of 1919, when the Gender Disqualification Removal act became a law in the United Kingdom. This album will feature this sonata arranged for cello.</p>

<p><strong>Risk and challenge:</strong></p>
<p>This is the first musical album that I've ever proposed; it is a very challenging project to start with.</p>
<p>As I started planning on it, I realized most of the music scores for the repertoire were either missing or unpublished. Not only that, restrictions on copyright and recording right are more complicated than what I expected. Funding is definitely that real issue, as most of the application for project funds require the first 10% cash match funding.</p>
<p>At the stage, I’ve managed to get all the scores, although one of the sonatas weren’t ever published. I have gotten a manuscript copy from British Library, and will have to transcribe into the form that is performable. As the copyright, I’ve also managed to find out all the information. I will have to pay for Limited Manufactured License before I start the recording sections.</p>
<p>From all above, what’s missing is only funding. It would be impossible to release this album if it doesn’t reach the target. </p>

<p><strong>Artist:</strong></p>

As I started planning on it, I realized most of the music scores for the repertoire were either missing or unpublished. Not only that, restrictions on copyright and recording right are more complicated than what I expected. Funding is definitely that real issue, as most of the application for project funds require the first 10% cash match funding.
At the stage, I’ve managed to get all the scores, although one of the sonatas weren’t ever published. I have gotten a manuscript copy from British Library, and will have to transcribe into the form that is performable. As the copyright, I’ve also managed to find out all the information. I will have to pay for Limited Manufactured License before I start the recording sections.
From all above, what’s missing is only funding. It would be impossible to release this album if it doesn’t reach the target.

<h3> </h3>
<h3>What is ""California?"" </h3>
<p>The second full length record for indie singer/songwriter Mary Scholz, ""California"" will be the most organic, intimate release yet. </p>
<ul>
<li>Focusing on the intimate style of Mary's live performances, this record will keep Mary's voice and lyrics front and center, supported by a stripped down, live band.</li>
<li>Recording on an Ampex 8 track tape machine, the record will be co-produced by Los Angeles musician and producer, Jason Hiller. This method of recording is what helps keep it organic and personal.</li>
<li>With Mary on acoustic guitar and piano, the record will also feature superb musicians on upright bass, electric guitar, cello and percussion. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hi Everyone</strong> - thank you for taking the time to learn about the next Mary Scholz record! I am so excited to get into the studio and record what feels like the most honest version of my music yet. As many of you know, I have been touring and releasing records independently for 11 years now, sharing my own life battles through song, in hopes that we can all come together, knowing that we're not alone. My last record, <i>The Girl You Thought You Knew</i>, centered around the experiences dealing with my relocation, divorce, and making peace with being exactly who I am. </p>
<p><i>California</i> is the next chapter - recognizing that sometimes the best choices in life are the scary ones, and finding yourself able to make those choices. <br/>It's about stepping into the sunlight - knowing what you want, and moving towards it.</p>
<p>It's also about love, longing, and ""what the hell did I get myself into??"" </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Most Important Collaborator: The Listener</h3>
<p><br/>Part of the perk of being an indie artist is having complete creative control over my material, (how it sounds, how it looks), and getting to collaborate with whomever I'd like, which helps me work towards my artistic goal.<br/><i>But one of my most important collaborators is the listener.</i>  <br/>You're the reason this music reaches an audience, instead of collecting dust in my lyric book. <br/>Your random messages when you have a special connection to a song is what keeps me putting my personal experiences out in the world. <br/>You are the driving force that keeps me going when the DIY solo artist world gets tough and the road gets weary. </p>
<p>I'm so excited to share this next chapter with you, but in order for this album to come to life, I need your help! I've saved money to make this record, but as one indie artist with no label backing, it would take quite a while to save enough.<br/><br/>So let's collaborate:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm aiming to raise $10,000 to cover studio costs, producer fees, tape fees and mastering. <br/>You can help here by simply pre-ordering the record, either digital or physical. You can also purchase items like the current Mary Scholz catalog, posters, handwritten lyrics, t-shirts, house concerts, Skype voice lessons, etc.<br/>Every. Dollar. Counts. </li>
<li>I'll be covering pre-production costs, musicians' salaries, instrument rental, artwork, photography, physical pressing (cd and vinyl!), distribution costs, promotion, PR, booking, travel, etc.<br/>(The list goes on!)</li>
<li>If we don't reach the entire goal, the money <i>still goes toward creating the record</i>.<br/>It just means that the end result will be delayed, as I'll be continuing to work and save to finish the record and book a release tour.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution to this project means so much to my creativity - but also to my health:</p>
<ul>
<li>In 2013 I was working 5 different jobs and in the studio overnight to make <i>TGYTYK</i> (alongside regular life costs) happen. It cost me $18,000 to make, 5 of which was raised right here. (Thank you!!)<br/>Those kinds of hours left me with very little sleep, migraines and various bouts of sickness during production. </li>
<li>I'll still be working full time through this process, but raising this dollar amount will give me the ability to stay focused on the creativity, and (fingers crossed) healthy throughout the production.</li>
<li>I could never have completed <i>TGYTYK </i>without you all - and I am so grateful for your continued Love and support.<br/> </li>

<h3>WHO AM I / WHO ARE WE?</h3>
<p>My name is Conrad, bandleader of The Big Butter Jazz Band, a L.A.-based Traditional Jazz band dedicated to playing classic jazz songs from the 1900's-1930's (and a few from the '40's). We've been playing around Los Angeles since 2013 at bars, restaurants, swing dances, festivals, and more.</p>
<p>Two years ago, I left my corporate job to pursue music and martial arts, the two passions of my life. It's been challenging, hustling for every gig, trying to make a living. For the most part, it's a one-man show behind the scenes. I do 98% of the booking, hiring, promotion, web design, and social media. And that's on top of practicing and actually playing music! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>WHY NOW?</strong></h3>
<p>After 3 years, it was time to record a CD and showcase some of the amazing musicians that the BBJB features. For you guys, it's a chance to enjoy our music when you want, outside of our shows.  Playing live is still our favorite, but having a CD is a crucial step in our development - with a CD we can better promote ourselves, plus we get to give you something you can take home.  And with the first one out of the way,  we can start planning the second one!</p>

<li>Hello! Welcome to my IndieGoGo page! I am an 18 year-old college student with a lifelong dream of a career in music as a singer and songwriter! I began writing songs at the age of 8, and I have since dreamed of going to Nashville to record my first EP (6 songs)! Now that I finally have the chance and opportunity to do so, I would love your help! </li>
<li>This campaign will help me make the best possible recording of the songs I've poured my heart into creating the past 18 months. I hope to work with the amazing producers and musicians in Nashville and believe your support will be the main reason I can.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul><li>I want to raise $15,000 which goes toward travel, studio time, mixing and mastering the end recordings, and marketing and promotions including an actual physical CD as well as online downloadable versions of the EP (6 songs). </li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>The music industry is full of successful artists who seem to be featured over and over again on radio. I want to break through as a new artist you'll hear on the radio too and this EP (6 songs) is a big part of that process.</li>
<li>My first single, ""Broken"" has received over 20,000 views on YouTube so far, and has received several awards already. I really think that recognition has helped me make valuable industry connections that will only be a great foundation and have the momentum needed to create this new EP (6 songs).</li>
<li>Music has been in my family for generations! I have been singing for as long as I can remember! Both of my parents grew up in very musical homes. My dad, Richey Gibbons, was on his way to fulfilling his dream as a rock star when he was diagnosed with a brain tumor. He passed away five days before I was born. My mom named me ""Anna Richey"" so that I would always have a piece of him with me at all times. When it came time to choose a stage name, I wanted to use his name, Richey, to carry on his legacy and dream as I pursue a full-time career in the music industry.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul><li>More than the music itself, your support is your belief in me as a person and artist. There are thousands of artists struggling to find their way and every one of them need financial resources to do what they are passionate to do. This is a risky project, but it's also the best way for me to present myself as a serious artist. I'm excited for this challenge and so thankful for your help.</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul>
<li>I have a great social media following of fans already and I'm just getting started. If you can support me with just even $25, it will make a huge difference.</li>
<li>It would seriously help to have you share the link to this fundraiser on your social media as well. Whether it's Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or whatever, sharing this link would help me so much.</li>

Hello! Welcome to my IndieGoGo page! I am an 18 year-old college student with a lifelong dream of a career in music as a singer and songwriter! I began writing songs at the age of 8, and I have since dreamed of going to Nashville to record my first EP (6 songs)! Now that I finally have the chance and opportunity to do so, I would love your help! 
This campaign will help me make the best possible recording of the songs I've poured my heart into creating the past 18 months. I hope to work with the amazing producers and musicians in Nashville and believe your support will be the main reason I can.


What We Need & What You Get
I want to raise $15,000 which goes toward travel, studio time, mixing and mastering the end recordings, and marketing and promotions including an actual physical CD as well as online downloadable versions of the EP (6 songs). 

The Impact

The music industry is full of successful artists who seem to be featured over and over again on radio. I want to break through as a new artist you'll hear on the radio too and this EP (6 songs) is a big part of that process.
My first single, ""Broken"" has received over 20,000 views on YouTube so far, and has received several awards already. I really think that recognition has helped me make valuable industry connections that will only be a great foundation and have the momentum needed to create this new EP (6 songs).
Music has been in my family for generations! I have been singing for as long as I can remember! Both of my parents grew up in very musical homes. My dad, Richey Gibbons, was on his way to fulfilling his dream as a rock star when he was diagnosed with a brain tumor. He passed away five days before I was born. My mom named me ""Anna Richey"" so that I would always have a piece of him with me at all times. When it came time to choose a stage name, I wanted to use his name, Richey, to carry on his legacy and dream as I pursue a full-time career in the music industry.


Risks & Challenges
More than the music itself, your support is your belief in me as a person and artist. There are thousands of artists struggling to find their way and every one of them need financial resources to do what they are passionate to do. This is a risky project, but it's also the best way for me to present myself as a serious artist. I'm excited for this challenge and so thankful for your help.

Other Ways You Can Help

I have a great social media following of fans already and I'm just getting started. If you can support me with just even $25, it will make a huge difference.

<h3>All-New Pop/Rock Original Music!</h3>
<p>Hi! We're Black Tie Stereo (Stephen, George, Aaron, and Jesse)! We're from Scranton, Pennsylvania (like The Office) and we play Pop/Rock tunes (like OneRepublic, Imagine Dragons, Walk the Moon, The Killers, Maroon 5).</p>
<p>You may know us or hear about us if you're from our area. We are honored to have been named Northeast Pennsylvania's Best Pop/Top 40 Act of 2016, and to have opened up for national acts such as Weezer, Panic! At the Disco, Steve Miller, and more.  But you may only know that we've done these things as a <i>cover</i> band, or one that doesn't write their own material.</p>
<p>We are actually primarily an <i>original</i> band. We have released a self-titled EP (Extended Play) of five songs and two singles over the past two years, all recorded with great people at great studios in our area. With your help on this project, we will add an additional five (or more) songs to our recorded library, professionally recorded in Los Angeles with producer Mark Mazzetti, who has similarly worked with artists that are household names (John Mayer, Janet Jackson, Sting, and more).</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why Do We Want This?</h3>
<p>This is HUGE for us.  Simply put: creating a project with an established music industry professional in Los Angeles dramatically increases our appeal to large record companies. This could mean making music our full-time career; hearing our songs on major radio stations around the country, going from packing bars in Scranton to filling concert venues everywhere, and fulfilling each of our individual and collective dreams of becoming successful in the music industry.  And it all starts with this 5-song EP, which all starts with YOU.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>You Will Be Rewarded!</h3>
<p>Of course, this isn't by any means cheap.  The $25,000 we are hoping to raise covers Production Cost, Producer Fees, Recording Cost, and goes towards housing, food, gas (yes, we are driving from Pennsylvania to Southern California!), and possible necessary equipment rentals.</p>
<p>But we won't let your donation go without thanks! In order to thank you for your donation, we've set up perk packages at certain donation levels.  These include all of our existing merchandise, signed copies of the eventual new release, private performances, your name on the EP liner notes, and your own A&amp;R (talent-seeking and artist development) session with Mark Mazzetti!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Happens If We Don't Raise All That $$$?</h3>
<p>We're viewing this as a platform to our one really big shot at success.  The project will happen, however much money we raise through Indiegogo.  The more money we raise through your generosity and support, the easier this will be for us. Thank you, as always, for whatever amount you can give!</p>
</div><div> </div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't donate right now, that's fine! ANY type of support helps - including sharing this page on <strong>Facebook</strong>, <strong>Twitter</strong>, <strong>Instagram</strong>, etc. to get the word out, and even coming to see our shows! Please feel free to listen to our current music on<strong> iTunes</strong>, <strong>Spotify</strong>, <strong>SoundCloud</strong>, and <strong>Amazon Music</strong>.  If you like what you hear so far, it will only get better, we promise!</p>

<h3>Hello!</h3>
<p>I'm so glad you've made it to this page!</p>
<p>Music and Judaism are the crux of my existence, so this debut project is incredibly important to me. I want to release an EP of 4 songs of my original Jewish music. My style ranges anywhere from acoustic melodic to folk to R&amp;B. I listen to a myriad of genres, and that can be seen in what I write. I will be recording in Los Angeles, CA with the amazing Josh Goldberg in mid-August.</p>

<b>A Music &amp; Film venue built from Pure Salvage without curfews, limitations, and in the midst of 18,000,000 people who could join us to celebrate and support all the ways we can work together to Save and improve the World.</b>  Lots of room to camp overnight for multi-day events that would enable the positive energy of people to get their works out through concerts and premiers out doors where thousands could assemble without an army of city police, huge expenses, and allow the freedom for people to speak out as we did in the days of Woodstock.  We have wars to stop, injustice to make right, and need the music and film venue capable of letting that dialogue happen once more.  Imagine the 12' x 40' stage on the back with that door above that leads to the recording studio.<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442709380/x1ghq5ryq9g7o7edimhb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

</li> <li>Contributors will be part of creating a legendary venue site that will be so creatively built, so incredibly low priced, and accessible to all right along Interstate 10 in the Heart of Texas where Austin, San Antonio, and Houston will be just a short drive away.  From here we can hold festivals and events as well as Barter markets for all things salvaged from the past, grown organically, created in America, and designed to make it possible to sing the songs and show the masses how we can wipe out the age of consumerism, Big Pharma, Big Oil, Insane Wars, and Global Corporations that are destroying our planet.  </li> </ul> <p>No where in Texas is there a place where we can gather together the masses that will be possible here in order to hold events to buy, sell, barter, and trade antiques, music, organic food, and all the salvage parts it takes to build Tiny Houses or bigger.  Events from giant weddings, bike and car rallies, solar, wind, and 0-point energy shows, preppers gatherings, Steampunk festivals, and so much more.  Promoters will get the venue nearly for free if the cause is right, and thus the cost to the public will be lower than possible in any city on the planet.  Very limited police force even able to come on the property so the freedoms we will have are unlike in the big cities that make a fortune off from hauling cars away, busting people for all the wrong reasons, and charging amazing fees for the use of public parks.  </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>As you can see from the <a href=""http://puresalvageliving.com/new-plan-for-music-film-festival-venue-one-door-closes-and-another-one-opens/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">pictures... it is already nearly built</a>...(photoblog with more shots) the land is already in hand... utilities and even the materials to build much more is in stock.. so that those who want to come and be part can.  <b>In return for contributing,  or volunteering people can get most of the materials they need to build market spaces,  book events, and get involved with establishing the schedules of regular festivals, rallies, concerts, markets, and other great ideas for the use of this venue in the years to come.</b></p> <ul> <li>The restaurant for concessions, cooking up the brownies, cookies, muffins, and popcorn, as well as serving cold drinks, and so much more is nearly completed already.  More refrigeration is needed and some finish out of the second story decks that will let people sit and view the Texas scenery for miles around while they eat, drink, and find happiness outside the city.  This will cost $10,000 to $15,000 to finish, depending on how much refrigeration we buy and help we get on finishing the decks.  <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442709238/cltkw7xf968fs9op6uba.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

A Music & Film venue built from Pure Salvage without curfews, limitations, and in the midst of 18,000,000 people who could join us to celebrate and support all the ways we can work together to Save and improve the World.  Lots of room to camp overnight for multi-day events that would enable the positive energy of people to get their works out through concerts and premiers out doors where thousands could assemble without an army of city police, huge expenses, and allow the freedom for people to speak out as we did in the days of Woodstock.  We have wars to stop, injustice to make right, and need the music and film venue capable of letting that dialogue happen once more.  Imagine the 12' x 40' stage on the back with that door above that leads to the recording studio.
 Not only will this grow the Pure Salvage Living Renaissance by proving we can finish building it all out of Salvage, in the Tiny Texas Houses tradition, but it will also create a market where we can barter our goods, music, crafts, and films to a public that is craving change from the status quo.  Freedom to create solutions, share them, and inspire others with festivals that are focused on Organic paths to Empowerment of the people can only be found outside the big cities where the bureaucracy can not limit or control us.  That is exactly what I have to offer and have nearly finished.  This fund is simply to top it off and let everyone know it is here, that you can book concerts, premiers, and market days for all think ecological, anti-war, and freedom of the people oriented.  Decades ago we had drive in theaters and this will give us a giant one where film festivals can run all night long.  Concerts can run for days on end with camping and RV spaces, Tiny Texas Houses to stay in, and extremely limited Authoritarian presence.  We are outside any city limits, so the possibilities are nearly endless.  Imagine this space filled in with people, and it goes much further back behind where this shot is taken.   
 Contributors will be part of creating a legendary venue site that will be so creatively built, so incredibly low priced, and accessible to all right along Interstate 10 in the Heart of Texas where Austin, San Antonio, and Houston will be just a short drive away.  From here we can hold festivals and events as well as Barter markets for all things salvaged from the past, grown organically, created in America, and designed to make it possible to sing the songs and show the masses how we can wipe out the age of consumerism, Big Pharma, Big Oil, Insane Wars, and Global Corporations that are destroying our planet.    No where in Texas is there a place where we can gather together the masses that will be possible here in order to hold events to buy, sell, barter, and trade antiques, music, organic food, and all the salvage parts it takes to build Tiny Houses or bigger.  Events from giant weddings, bike and car rallies, solar, wind, and 0-point energy shows, preppers gatherings, Steampunk festivals, and so much more.  Promoters will get the venue nearly for free if the cause is right, and thus the cost to the public will be lower than possible in any city on the planet.  Very limited police force even able to come on the property so the freedoms we will have are unlike in the big cities that make a fortune off from hauling cars away, busting people for all the wrong reasons, and charging amazing fees for the use of public parks.     What We Need & What You Get As you can see from the pictures... it is already nearly built...(photoblog with more shots) the land is already in hand... utilities and even the materials to build much more is in stock.. so that those who want to come and be part can.  In return for contributing,  or volunteering people can get most of the materials they need to build market spaces,  book events, and get involved with establishing the schedules of regular festivals, rallies, concerts, markets, and other great ideas for the use of this venue in the years to come.  The restaurant for concessions, cooking up the brownies, cookies, muffins, and popcorn, as well as serving cold drinks, and so much more is nearly completed already.  More refrigeration is needed and some finish out of the second story decks that will let people sit and view the Texas scenery for miles around while they eat, drink, and find happiness outside the city.  This will cost $10,000 to $15,000 to finish, depending on how much refrigeration we buy and help we get on finishing the decks.  



The recording studio for audio and video production behind the stage on the back of the building is also nearly finished so that visiting groups can set up in a quiet peaceful space and create masterpieces.  A few thousand will take care of that.  Here is the entrance and shots of the inside of the quiet studio space.


We have spaces inside for gatherings, that still need some flooring and ceilings which the materials are in stock for, but some of the labor has to be taken care of adding a couple of grand.  We  even some 3rd story space for 1,000 sf of  guest dorms if we get extra money.
 The bigger contributors will get to book Music Concert, Film Festivals, and events of other sorts dates as rewards for $1,000 or larger contributions.  We will create a Drive-in Venue using vintage beams cut to let cars drive up on, park, and  create the classic pitch of the old drive in theaters, then use FM transmitters to reach the cars with great sounds.  The projector and FM transmitter will be the biggest cost but a few grand should do it, or better yet a donation by a corporation wanting to prove their product and a giant canvas or Highway billboard sign reversed to show the movies on.  We will offer free tickets to the concerts and events for the $50+ contributors as well as free parking.  The people who want Market spaces will get all the materials for a 10' x 20' space for $2,000 contributions, including roofing metal, Cobalt clay tile for roofs, doors, windows, and posts needed to build weatherproof digs, and their prime location spaces for events at no cost for a year.   This is a view of some of the materials ready to go and one of the buildings for the market on the frontage. All the money raised will go to completing and opening up Salvagefaire for the public to have a venue where thousands can meet for weekday or weekend bookings.  We already have camping spaces for tents, RV spaces, and if we get more than our target we will add more along with bath houses for over night guests too.  We also have Tiny Texas Houses to stay in by the ponds.  
We have the materials in place to do it all, and other great projects like covered and screened campsites, but the labor is a cost factor unless volunteers show up.  Those who come to help will be able to barter time for materials or free use of the camp houses they help build.  The more we get, the more incredible we will build out the facility so that it will be able to grow into the biggest and best space for concerts and film festivals in Texas.  
Most of the profits from Salvagefaire events will be going toward creating the 30 Building Plans and Space Magic with Pure Salvage Book to show others how to build Tiny Texas Houses or manifest other toxin free dream homes sustainably out of 95% Pure Salvage.  The big picture is to promote the Pure Salvage Living Renaissance so that people can grow this concept in places far from Texas and keep moving forward with sharing how to empower the people without government and big corporations controlling the narrative.       Having a positive Impact on millions is possible. You can actually help create a forum for change in this challenge to activists and people concerned enough to write music, make films, and do all they can with their energy of soul to change the world into a better place.    Once upon a time it was possible for musicians to be heard by large crowds as they sang about stopping the War, helping Farmers, and social reforms we needed to make in America.  Now most venues are controlled by the very people we were protesting about so the chance to get a film onto the big screens that threatens the status quo is nearly impossible.  Lets change that. 
Musicians singing about change like Joan Baez, Dylan, Crosby, Stills, &Nash, the Byrds, and so many others can be heard again if the festivals are open and they do not cost them anything to come and perform.  This is the chance for you to help make that to happen again as well as come to see it for free. Tiny Texas Houses has proven to the world we can build incredible sustainably built energy efficient houses out of 95% Pure Salvage that are toxin free and now it is time to take it to the next level.  By creating the markets for people to get the parts and pieces, even through barter rather than cash, we will open up a new door to the empowerment of the people.  The music and film festival venue will enable us to fund the further growth of Salvagefaire, as well as the book and building plans projects using profits from concessions and parking.  That way we can sponsor events that our followers feel are important.

are – Josh Cohen, Ryan Scully, Bailey Smith, Steve Calandra, Mike Andrepont and
Rick Hukill. In1998, we began writing, recording and touring the United States.
We’ve played major U.S. festivals (SXSW, Voodoo, Jazz Fest, etc.) and have been
interviewed and reviewed by NPR, Billboard, Spin, Maxim, CNN, The New York
Times, and Playboy among others.  </p>
<p>Those of you who know
us already know that a few years ago we went on hiatus (Alright! We broke up!)
to reassess our place in the universe. After a couple of years, it told us to
get back together and play. From the first rehearsal things began to click. You
could say we've been experiencing a bit of a Morning Forty Renaissance, or as
Scully likes to say, a ""Fortyaissance"". As new songs and ideas spew
forth, releasing a traditional CD has lost its appeal. Our goal is to produce
and record a series of 7 inch records that capture this resurgence, i.e., a
fully realized piece of sonic art. In order to bring this to fruition, we need
additional funding. Here's where you can help!</p>
<p><b>The Project</b></p>
<p>The project we’ve been
working on is a set of four limited edition 7 inch vinyl singles (500 of each).
Each record will have its own theme complete with front covers designed by New
Orleans artists, colored vinyl based on the theme of the record, and an image
on the back, that can only be viewed when all four back covers are put
together. The music for one of the four records has already been recorded,
having been produced by <a href=""http://galacticfunk.com/site/home"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Galactic's own Ben Ellman</a>, with <a href=""http://www.righteousbabe.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ani DiFranco</a> on
backup vocals. The two songs are called ""From Conception"" and
""Wild White Tears."" (You guess the theme and what the color of the
vinyl will be.)</p>
<p><b>Why do we need your money?</b></p>
<p>We were able to pay
for the first two recordings with a little help from a friend. Now we need help
from our other friends and fans to bring it home. </p>
<p>To complete this
project, we need to raise an additional $16,000 to cover the expenses. As with
the first recording, the next three will have reputable producers each chosen
to fit the theme and sound of the record. Your funding will pay for those
producers as well as studio time, record pressing, photography, and all of the
miscellaneous expenses that come with such an undertaking. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Perks</b></p>
<p>We have put together a few perks and
incentives in the vein of other campaigns we’ve seen. However if there is
nothing here that you want, or if you feel like you would like to contribute a
different amount, you are not limited to the donation price points to the
right. You may contribute any amount you are comfortable with at the top of the
page, right above the large red “Contribute Now” button. </p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>Whether or not you
contribute financially, we would really appreciate your help in spreading the
word about our Indiegogo campaign. Please tell your friends about our campaign
through Facebook, Twitter, and email! Do you know some people who love being
part of projects like this? Do you know a billionaire who has a soft spot for a
bunch of good-timing, New Orleans rabble-rousers? Please send it their way!</p>
