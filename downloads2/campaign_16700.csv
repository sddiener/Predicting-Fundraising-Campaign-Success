Through the CartHorse, Buran provides equitable opportunities to artists whose work would otherwise not be developed and presented; simultaneously, we seek to challenge organizational paradigms in the non-profit performing arts field that favor marginalization, nepotism, commercialization, and hierarchy. In line with Buran's mission of generosity and inclusion, we actively seek - through our presentations, explorations and administration - to demote and dismantle capitalism's influence on theatre-making by promoting and bestowing our horizontal practices through the Fellowship toward radical, queer and impossible performance ventures.</p><p>Our first CartHorse Fellow <strong>Cara Scarmack</strong> is now seeing her work fully realized through two years of developmental and creative support. The Fellowship allowed Cara to take the lead in the creative process, with Buran Theatre responding and serving her vision as best as we could. The result of Cara's CartHorse will be the premiere of <strong><i>some higher glimmer in our landscape of flat</i></strong> at the <strong>Collapsable Hole </strong>in the West Village (NYC) from October 20-November 3 under the direction of <strong>Sarah Hughes</strong>.</p><p>Cara has written a wild and beautiful text that defies genre and, quite frankly, explanation. The text itself is experiential and immersive, bending your mind and inner ear toward a zany poetic realm of maternal warmth that embraces the humanness of failure and desire. The play lives between the folds of theatre, dance and music; it is a play about slippage between time, genre and ever-evolving relationship.</p><p>Described by Cara as a “journey play that traverses the double-edged sword of solitude,” every character has their turn in this play: to take up space, to speak, and to challenge and alter the course of narrative. A central character is a singular force in the world: a Mother who has just given birth and now wears her raw heart on the outside. Harnessing her severe vulnerability and the love she’s newly discovered, she provokes a slew of philosophical revelations. Simultaneously or consequently, a number of duos – dancing, singing, and conversing – uncover everything we once knew but have forgotten, the ills we are unaware of, and how these unknowns are hurting us.</p><p>Cara, Sarah and Buran Theatre have assembled an <i>absolutely stellar team</i> of collaborators to bring this work to life, including many Buran associates as well as many new faces to the company. Collaborators include choreographer <strong>lisa nevada</strong>, composer<strong> Johnny Gasper</strong>, lighting/video designer <strong>Jeanette Oi-Suk Yew</strong>, costume designer <strong>Peiyi Wong</strong>, set designers <strong>Carolyn Mraz</strong> &amp; <strong>Cori Williams</strong>, musical director<strong> Alaina Ferris</strong>, technical director <strong>Nicholas Kostner</strong>, and performers <strong>Laurena Allen, Kate Benson</strong>, <strong>LaToya Lewis</strong>, <strong>Lanxing Fu, Manny Rivera</strong>, <strong>Kate Schroeder</strong>, and <strong>Merlin Whitehawk</strong>, among others.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3><p>Over the past year we have persistently sought funding for this project and have successfully raised nearly $10,000 from grants, including The Edith Lutyens and Norman Bel Geddes Design Enhancement Fund grant from A.R.T./N.Y.

<p>Theatre is not a hobby. It’s something you feel inside. Something that represents you.</p>
<p>In Italy it’s not usual to go to the theatre. This country would be more alive if everyone, once in their lifetime, decided to go to the theatre.</p>
<p>One day someone told me: it’s not that we have no money. We have no people with imagination. And willing to use it, I might add.</p>
<p>We have no wish to be bold, to be creative.</p>
<p>We live in constant fear of judgments, we need to conform to a society that tends towards apathy.</p>
<p>I firmly believe in The Black Box Project because I know it will change the history of theatre in Italy for good.</p>
<p>After centuries we’ll bring back to life one of our best traditions: the pantomime!</p>
<p>It is Commedia dell’Arte, it is a musical, it is entertainment, and much more.</p>
<p>It’s for everybody, none excluded, from 0 to 100 years old people!</p>
<p>It’s a project that involves people who want to create, people who want their voice to be heard, who want to show their talent on a theatre stage.</p>
<p>However, like any other project it needs everybody’s help. When the government cannot help, we are there to help, all together.</p>
<p>I am here to ask you to donate something. Something for a community, for a society, something for me and all of us. And all of you.</p>
<p>Theatre is something that doesn’t belong only to me, it belongs to you, to all of us.</p>
<p>If we help each other, we will take a step forward to better ourselves.</p>
<p>Thank you so much. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.</p>
<p>We need 5000 pounds to get started. We want everybody to perform a great job and it is fair that everybody is paid for that. We also need props, costumes, to pay the theatre rent and much more.</p>
<p>All the money will be spent on the project, to create something great that will help people fall in love with theatre and willing to go back on a regular basis.</p>
<p>We create something different because we are artists with a huge imagination and we want to share our passion with all of you.</p>
<p>I promise that this will be the best show ever of 2020. Let us deliver a quality job and all the dreams you are looking for in a play.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We would like to raise at least $2,500 for this performance, so that we can donate $1,300 to the NAACP’s Legal Defense Fund and still guarantee each otherwise unemployed performer a minimum of $100 for their time creating this magic. Please help make this happen! </p>
<p>For patrons donating $50 or more, our Bard will record a Shakespearean sonnet of your choice, just for you.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Funding our campaign will directly help the struggle for racial equality in the United States. At this time of social injustice, we need all the allies we can get! The NAACP is a BBB certified charitable organization of the highest caliber, and we are proud to support them.</p>
<p>You will also become a patron of the arts, helping professional entertainers pay their bills, their groceries, and avoid further poverty or credit card debt.</p>
<p>Last but certainly not least, you will help extend hope and build morale for our fellow members of humanity by giving them a much-needed distraction during this crisis, a sense that we all have people around us who care enough to make this world more just, more equitable, and more magical.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><div><p>Many of us cannot afford to support any cause financially during this troubled time, and we all (personally) understand how this feels. You can still help this campaign by sharing it with friends, family, social groups, etc. And if you can do so in the future, please donate to the NAACP or other organizations fighting for racial equality.</p></div></div>","A PRODUCTION OFShakespeare Approves: Your Friendly Neighborhood ShakespeareThe Social Distancing PlayersThe Zenith Playersand Maisha Elonai

What We Need & What You Get
We would like to raise at least $2,500 for this performance, so that we can donate $1,300 to the NAACP’s Legal Defense Fund and still guarantee each otherwise unemployed performer a minimum of $100 for their time creating this magic. Please help make this happen! 
For patrons donating $50 or more, our Bard will record a Shakespearean sonnet of your choice, just for you.
 

The Impact
Funding our campaign will directly help the struggle for racial equality in the United States. At this time of social injustice, we need all the allies we can get! The NAACP is a BBB certified charitable organization of the highest caliber, and we are proud to support them.
You will also become a patron of the arts, helping professional entertainers pay their bills, their groceries, and avoid further poverty or credit card debt.
Last but certainly not least, you will help extend hope and build morale for our fellow members of humanity by giving them a much-needed distraction during this crisis, a sense that we all have people around us who care enough to make this world more just, more equitable, and more magical.
 
Other Ways You Can HelpMany of us cannot afford to support any cause financially during this troubled time, and we all (personally) understand how this feels. You can still help this campaign by sharing it with friends, family, social groups, etc. And if you can do so in the future, please donate to the NAACP or other organizations fighting for racial equality.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>THE LAUNCH: John on the Island of Patmos</h3>
<p>JOHN @PATMOS springs to life in this world-premier work by Daniel Stompor! Set on a Greek island roughly 1000 years after the life and death of Christ, PATMOS follows the exile of the forgotten, beloved apostle John amidst an incursion led by King Henry II of England on his way to pay homage in Jerusalem. In tow are the royal sons (and would-be kings) Fitz and Rich, an imprisoned Eleanore of Aquitaine, and a curious guard named Petra. With the End of Days fast approaching, John grapples with a royal family struggling to live both Queer and Catholic while searching for where in the world has space for an immortal jewish apostle thriving far afield of any binary. As John grapples with his role in creating a world of cultural colonization, it becomes less and less clear if this whole Christianity thing is worth saving.</p>
<p>Directed by Sofía Anastasia, PATMOS features the talents of Madison Couture, Irisdelia Garcia, Ash Laraque-Ho, Elle Vallejos, and Angel Zeas. The show’s design incorporates the work of costumes by Paul Van Sickle, lights by Erik Peterson, sound by Emma Hasselbach, and space by Madison Couture. Script development and dramaturgy by Viv\\Ian Chace.</p>
<p>Living somewhere between historical fantasy and spiritual passion play, PATMOS is a conjecture of queer identities encountering one another in a world somewhere adjacent to our own. Queer imaginings and reimaginings of historical figures have long been an element of euro-western LGBTQ storytelling. Exploring this tradition laid the foundation for PATMOS, wherein queer bodies navigate the claiming of their narratives and bodies by others, and the violence that can result from losing control of your own story. JOHN @PATMOS was conceived at Northwestern University and is in continued development in Queens, NY from December 2018 to present.</p>

<h2>Milo's World: A Digital Musical Song Cycle About Creating Art!</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>4Score Productions and On Its Way Musical Productions are raising funds to produce, record, and present Milo's World, an original musical song cycle premiering digitally this fall.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Milo’s World follows a budding sculpture artist, stuck attempting to create the final piece for a career-defining commission. The pressure from her agent, an unforgiving deadline, and herself, send her spiraling on a dark and desperate search for inspiration in the confines of her studio. Throughout the riveting score of 13 original songs, Milo fluxes in and out of reality and begins to see that her world contains much more than meets the eye.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Help Produce This New Musical Song Cycle and Album!</i></p>
<h3>About the Writer</h3>

<h3>The Impact of Contributing </h3>
<p>Milo's World is being produced by two small indie companies (4Score Productions and On Its Way Musical Productions) who care deeply about the work that they do and the young artists that they work with! They are taking a risk by employing an artistic team of emerging professionals to work on this show. This is also the first original musical that both companies have been involved in bringing it to life.</p>
<h3>Where Contributions Go? </h3>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The financial risk involved in bringing a brand new musical and album to life is rather large for us.

But with your support, we will be able to bring it to life. We have dreams of continuing to support and develop new musical works by this artist, so if <i>Milo’s World</i> is successful this surely won’t be the first original musical and cast album that we produce! </p>

<i>Almost, Maine</i> is a romantic comedy that consists of short, 10 minute vignettes of the citizens of the titular town. The show takes it’s time going from pair to pair, and let’s the viewer get to slowly get the idea of what the citizens of Almost are all about; which is them finding out who they are, and who they do or do not need in their lives to find that person. The show is funny, smart, sweet, and sincere, and is never trying to be anything other than honest. I feel the struggle of being sincere to one’s true character is an epidemic all college students can relate to in this whirlwind period of our lives. Not only is this a show many can relate to, it has taken the nation by storm as a popular showcase of emotion that many theatre patrons citywide will flock towards. With Valentine's Day, and cold weather to cuddle up to, February couldn't be more appropriate to feature this love-ly tale.</li>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>It's a Win, Win, Win, Win, Win.</h3> <p>The production of <i>Almost, Maine</i> will cost nothing compared to the ""MainStage series"", that of which is directed by faculty, and consisting of a paid team.

Yes, these tasks will be significantly more hands on, but it comes with endless learning opportunities. </p>
<p>Where the budget is needed comes in two important parts: the rights, and the rest. Rights aren't cheap, $100 per performance.

No one will be compensated in making this miracle happen, but funds are more than necessary for setting it all up.

Georgia State University, a thriving university in the heart of Atlanta, Georgia, is  home to the Georgia State University Players, the oldest organization on campus, honing on providing Atlantans with prime performances, lead by the faculty and working professionals in the area to feature students both on stage and off in two main stages a year, along with a student showcase,  a staged reading, as well as bringing the GSU Players several workshops and many opportunities to hone their craft.

Hello everyone, my name is Dagny Ingle. First, a little about me. I am a 14 year old high school freshman from Macon, Georgia, USA (small town about 100 miles south of Atlanta).  I am a straight ""A"" student (nerd) pursuing an International Baccalaureate diploma with a Fine Arts minor (in Dance) from Central High School's magnet programs. I am a devout Sherlock/Dr. Who fan (go BBC!). An avid reader of John Green novels. I also play the violin. But first and foremost (and most relevant), I am a Dancer.

<p>
I have been dancing since I was 3 years old. I have turned my 3 year old's outlet to burn excess energy into a passion I will pursue for the rest of my life. If only mom had known then that the weekly 30 minute Saturday class would become an daily 3 to 4 hour, every weekend for rehearsals, every hour outside school phenomenon,  she might have reconsidered.

I have found my calling.  I wish to dance professionally and in that pursuit, I am attempting to gain best instruction from the best available.  I have been fortunate to have had my ballet education with Mrs. Jane Madison at the Madison Studio - Dance Education for the last 10 years.  Under her mentorship and her excellent faculty, I have gained the technique, strength and artistry that allowed me the confidence to audition for the American Ballet Theater Summer Intensive and gain a coveted invitation to attend their New York City Advance program.</p>

Now for the hard part, funding. I will need to fund my tuition, accommodations for two (room and board), proper dance attire (ABT dancewear) and transportation. As I am 14, my age requires me to have a chaperon. As the intensive is for 5 weeks, June 22nd until July 24th, the accommodations will need to be for both my mother and myself. Finding accommodations for 5 weeks in New York City has been eye opening and frankly frightening experience. The price is intimidating but as I have informed my mom, the internet is vast. So I am turning to you, the dance enthusiasts of the web to help me obtain a piece of my dream.
</p>
<p>
I am asking you to take a journey with me this summer.  Support me with a donation and/or share my story/link on your social networking platform (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc.).  I will let everyone who donates follow me on my Facebook Blog during the intensive.  I will share insight into the day to day and just keep you all informed on how NYC is treating me. 
</p>
<p>
In all honesty this dream is currently beyond my single mom's means.  If I am going to continue to get the best instruction from true Ballet Master teachers, I know I am going to need financial help. Please consider supporting me. Donate, spread my story (share, share, share) and join me on my Dancing Dream journey.  Thank you everyone.</p>

We have grown from our first musical, written, rehearsed, and performed in just six weeks, to producing four mainstage shows, a 24-Hour Musical for charity, a festival of one-acts, and a variety of educational workshops and events every season. Before HOOLIGAN was founded, there was no way to be involved with theatre on campus unless students were in the theater major. Now, we are able to provide opportunities as performers, technicians, or staff for over 200 UCLA students, from Engineering majors to English majors and everything in-between! HOOLIGAN has become a family for many students on campus and strives to provide a home away from home for students of all backgrounds with an interest in theater.</p><p>Producing theatre as a student group at UCLA becomes more expensive every year. Last year, HOOLIGAN’s annual budget reached a high of $120,000. As less funding comes from the university, we as students become more dependent on the generosity of donors and the cast and crew becomes responsible for fundraising a larger percentage of the budget.  We are hoping to celebrate our 10th season by raising $10,000 to relieve much of the financial burden placed on students to make theater happen on campus. This sum will help ensure that students do not have to spend their own money up front to guarantee that we have a venue to perform in. We are so grateful for our first decade on campus and hope to keep HOOLIGAN Theatre around for many more seasons to come.  Each and every donation makes a tremendous difference for us!  </p>This is the largest fundraising effort we have ever attempted, and we are so excited to celebrate our 10th season on campus and hope that you can donate $10 to help keep theatre opportunities alive for UCLA students of all majors!

<p>What followed was months of

Aside from the questions the play raises about the capacity of human interplay as a whole, interestingly, the reactions to the illness explored in this fable and the misinformation of authorities thereof, not only embody a small microcosm of what happened in 1918, but also how the world handled - or rather mishandled - the more recent Ebola Outbreak.</p>

The Impact of the Play

Dramatic impact:
Alex Merilo, a young, award winning and critically acclaimed playwright manages to do successfully what many contemporary playwrights cannot, and that is to continually twist and turn a suspenseful tale until it reaches an outcome audiences do not see coming.
Additionally, not only is the plot captivating, but the characters speak in beautifully written prose, so rare in contemporary playwriting, yet so enriching for the audience’s ear.
From an acting standpoint, this two-hander is a tour de force for two young actors. They are on stage the entire time, embroiled in a byzantine relationship, surrounded by extreme circumstances.
What a thrilling way for audiences to spend an evening, instead of slumped on one’s couch in front of the television screen!
On the global front:
Although this play is not intended to be an historic account by any means, it is significant to note that the workshop production of The Widow of Tom’s Hill at Luna went up in June 2014, just one week before any major news arrived of last spring’s Ebola outbreak, and numerous weeks before the onset of abject hysteria, media frenzy, and clear mishandling by authorities. Aside from the questions the play raises about the capacity of human interplay as a whole, interestingly, the reactions to the illness explored in this fable and the misinformation of authorities thereof, not only embody a small microcosm of what happened in 1918, but also how the world handled - or rather mishandled - the more recent Ebola Outbreak.
As for the Influenza of 1918, it is lost history. We have forgotten its enormous impact and the scope of loss. Three to five percent of the world’s population died from the illness. It killed more people in twenty four weeks than AIDS killed in twenty four years, and more people in a year than the Black Death of the middle ages killed in a century.
The story told in The Widow of Tom’s Hill moves us to ask: What impact do global disasters have on us as a people? But perhaps most pointedly, how does human nature, and the complexities and circumstances of our individual lives play a part in how we react?

<p> <b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Murray Louis</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> was born on November 4, 1926 in Brooklyn, New York. He is known as one of the most influential American modern dancers and choreographers. He grew up in Manhattan near Henry Street where he would later attend class at the <b>Henry Street Playhouse</b> and also start his company. He was one out of five children and his mother died when he was eight years old. He was then sent to an orphanage until he was twelve. He graduated from Samuel Tildon High School in 1944.</span></p>
<p>Louis was discharged from the Navy in 1946 and began to live in San Francisco, California. He then enrolled at Colorado College for a summer session conducted by <b>Hanya Holm</b> in 1949. It was there during one of their workshops where he met Alwin Nikolais, who would later become his mentor and lifelong partner. That year he moved back to New York to pursue a Dramatic Arts degree at New York University and attend class with <b>Nikolais</b> at Henry Street Playhouse. Louis made his debut as the lead soloist in Nikolais’ newly formed Playhouse Dance Company (which would late be renamed the Nikolais Dance Theater)</p>
<p>                                             <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1192277/files/20150203000801-Screen_Shot_2015-01-29_at_1.06.09_PM.png?1422950881"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Louis was chosen as Associate Director to Nikolais and together they created the Nikolais/Louis dance technique, which would become a major influence on modern dance and is still taught by his students. Louis founded his own company in 1968 known as the <b>Murray Louis Dance Company</b>. His company was then chosen to represent the U.S. State Department on a two-month tour of India in 1968. In 1972 he piloted the “Artist in School” program. He also created two works for Rudolph Nureyev to debut on Broadway in 1978. Louis additionally worked in television in the United States and Europe. In 1984 the Murray Louis Dance Company collaborated with the Dave Brubeck Quartet and had four very successful seasons, which were broadcast in the United States, Europe, and Japan. Some of his choreographed works include Pulcinello for Batsheva Dance Company for Israeli television and The Tales of Cri-Cri for Mexico City television. In July 1987 PBS televised <i>Nik and Murray</i>, an award winning documentary film by Christian Blackwood, in their American Masters series. The Princeton Book Publishing Company released a video called Murray Louis in Concert, a collection of solos in 1989.</p>
<p>Louis also had his collection of essays, <i>Inside Dance</i>, published by St. Martin’s Press and released a five-part film series, <i>Dance as an Art Form</i>, which is now used as an introduction series for Educational Arts programs in the United States.<sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Louis#cite_note-4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[4]</a></sup> A Cappella Books published his second book of essays, <i>On Dance</i>. Louis’s and Nikolais’ dance companies merged in 1989.<sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Louis#cite_note-5"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[5]</a></sup> On May 8, 1993 Louis’s most influential mentor and partner, Alwin Nikolais, died. Louis did not dance for 2 years after Nikolais’ death. In 1995 his company performed at Carnegie Hall for 10,000 children during their “LINK” program and in 1996 he completed a five-part video series titled, The World of Alwin Nikolais.</p>
<h2>Work &amp; Accomplishments</h2>
<p>Louis had many accomplishments and received copious amounts of awards, recognitions, and honorary degrees. He received the Dance magazine award in 1977, which was presented to him by his former dance instructor Hanya Holm. He also received a Thank You letter from Harry Truman, the Colorado Contemporary Dance Award, two John Simon Guggenheim Fellowships, and the Scripps/American Dance Festival award (June 18, 2006). In 1998, he was selected as a Phi Beta Kappa Visiting Scholar for a “distinguished lecture” tour of twelve universities and colleges in the United States. Louis received his first Honorary Degree from Indiana University in 1970, his Honorary Doctorate of Performing Arts from Ohio University in 1999, his second Honorary Degree from Rutgers University in 2000, and his third Honorary Degree from Boston Conservatory in 2004. In 1998 Louis started assembling his archives and they are now available at the Ohio University’s Vernon R. Alden Library in Athens, Ohio.<sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Louis#cite_note-6"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[6]</a></sup> He has created over 100 works (including 70 ballets), performed in 20 nations and every state of the United States, and has toured five continents. He is one of the few choreographers to dance in his own creations and a variety of composers have produced music for him and his performances. He has also choreographed to the music of Bach, Brahms, Schubert, Stravinsky, Tchaikovsky, and many others. Some of the companies he has choreographed dances for include: The Royal Danish Ballet, The Jose Limon Company, The Hamburg Opera Ballet, The Scottish Ballet, The Berlin Opera Ballet, and The Cleveland Ballet.</p>
<p>Louis speaking of his choreography once said, “I don’t have a style. I come out of dance itself. I operate the principles of dance the way I talk. I get a point of view. Each piece has its own identity. It’s what choreography is all about.”</p>
<p>Murray Louis continues to live and work in New York City, New York.</p>

FROM THE HORSE'S MOUTH



From the Horse's Mouth celebrates Murray Louis, dancer, choreographer, teacher, mentor, and overall force of nature, who with Alwin Nikolais helped to shape the heart and history of dance at Henry Street Settlement. Twenty-five outstanding dancers, choreographers, critics, and friends of all ages and traditions will share their stories of Murray through their own unique styles of dance. Conceived and directed by Tina Croll and Jamie Cunningham.

                                   
 Murray Louis was born on November 4, 1926 in Brooklyn, New York. He is known as one of the most influential American modern dancers and choreographers. He grew up in Manhattan near Henry Street where he would later attend class at the Henry Street Playhouse and also start his company. He was one out of five children and his mother died when he was eight years old. He was then sent to an orphanage until he was twelve. He graduated from Samuel Tildon High School in 1944.
Louis was discharged from the Navy in 1946 and began to live in San Francisco, California. He then enrolled at Colorado College for a summer session conducted by Hanya Holm in 1949. It was there during one of their workshops where he met Alwin Nikolais, who would later become his mentor and lifelong partner. That year he moved back to New York to pursue a Dramatic Arts degree at New York University and attend class with Nikolais at Henry Street Playhouse. Louis made his debut as the lead soloist in Nikolais’ newly formed Playhouse Dance Company (which would late be renamed the Nikolais Dance Theater)
                                             
Louis was chosen as Associate Director to Nikolais and together they created the Nikolais/Louis dance technique, which would become a major influence on modern dance and is still taught by his students. Louis founded his own company in 1968 known as the Murray Louis Dance Company. His company was then chosen to represent the U.S. State Department on a two-month tour of India in 1968. In 1972 he piloted the “Artist in School” program. He also created two works for Rudolph Nureyev to debut on Broadway in 1978. Louis additionally worked in television in the United States and Europe. In 1984 the Murray Louis Dance Company collaborated with the Dave Brubeck Quartet and had four very successful seasons, which were broadcast in the United States, Europe, and Japan. Some of his choreographed works include Pulcinello for Batsheva Dance Company for Israeli television and The Tales of Cri-Cri for Mexico City television. In July 1987 PBS televised Nik and Murray, an award winning documentary film by Christian Blackwood, in their American Masters series. The Princeton Book Publishing Company released a video called Murray Louis in Concert, a collection of solos in 1989.
Louis also had his collection of essays, Inside Dance, published by St. Martin’s Press and released a five-part film series, Dance as an Art Form, which is now used as an introduction series for Educational Arts programs in the United States.[4] A Cappella Books published his second book of essays, On Dance. Louis’s and Nikolais’ dance companies merged in 1989.[5] On May 8, 1993 Louis’s most influential mentor and partner, Alwin Nikolais, died. Louis did not dance for 2 years after Nikolais’ death. In 1995 his company performed at Carnegie Hall for 10,000 children during their “LINK” program and in 1996 he completed a five-part video series titled, The World of Alwin Nikolais.
Work & Accomplishments
Louis had many accomplishments and received copious amounts of awards, recognitions, and honorary degrees. He received the Dance magazine award in 1977, which was presented to him by his former dance instructor Hanya Holm. He also received a Thank You letter from Harry Truman, the Colorado Contemporary Dance Award, two John Simon Guggenheim Fellowships, and the Scripps/American Dance Festival award (June 18, 2006). In 1998, he was selected as a Phi Beta Kappa Visiting Scholar for a “distinguished lecture” tour of twelve universities and colleges in the United States. Louis received his first Honorary Degree from Indiana University in 1970, his Honorary Doctorate of Performing Arts from Ohio University in 1999, his second Honorary Degree from Rutgers University in 2000, and his third Honorary Degree from Boston Conservatory in 2004. In 1998 Louis started assembling his archives and they are now available at the Ohio University’s Vernon R. Alden Library in Athens, Ohio.[6] He has created over 100 works (including 70 ballets), performed in 20 nations and every state of the United States, and has toured five continents. He is one of the few choreographers to dance in his own creations and a variety of composers have produced music for him and his performances. He has also choreographed to the music of Bach, Brahms, Schubert, Stravinsky, Tchaikovsky, and many others. Some of the companies he has choreographed dances for include: The Royal Danish Ballet, The Jose Limon Company, The Hamburg Opera Ballet, The Scottish Ballet, The Berlin Opera Ballet, and The Cleveland Ballet.
Louis speaking of his choreography once said, “I don’t have a style. I come out of dance itself. I operate the principles of dance the way I talk. I get a point of view. Each piece has its own identity. It’s what choreography is all about.”
Murray Louis continues to live and work in New York City, New York.

""I believe if you have been successful at what you dreamed of doing with your life, then it is your obligation to spend a good portion of your time sending the elevator back down...All of us can send the elevator back down because it doesn't matter what floor you're on; in life there is always someone below, just waiting for the chance to be invited up. Our job is to make sure the floors we live on are not so high we no longer hear the voices of young people crying out for opportunity and experience that will help shape a better future."" -Kevin Spacey
Thanks in advance for sending the elevator back down.

</p><p>
</p><p><b>What is <i>Titus Andronicus</i>, and why is it relevant today?</b></p>
<p><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Titus Andronicus</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""> is a brutal but beautifully poignant play about the heads of two opposing families--the Roman general Titus, and the Queen of the Goths, Tamora--who each choose the path of revenge over mercy and are ultimately destroyed by that choice. Metamorphosis is a major theme in this play, and many of the characters undergo major transformations, physical or otherwise, but the most central transformation is that of the character of Titus, from a dispassionate follower of rules, authority, and ritual, to a feeling, hurting, passionate human being, who is capable of emotion-filled acts of violence.  </span><br/></p>
<p>This is a provocative play about the themes of violence (including sexual violence), revenge, racism, and the concepts of barbarity versus civilization.  While these deep themes are sometimes overlooked in favor of an emphasis on the gore and grotesqueness of the play, they point to the play's--and Shakespeare's--underlying sense of humanity. </p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Although</span><i style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> Titus Andronicus</i><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> was quite popular among Elizabethan audiences, it was maligned for centuries as too violent to be either respectable or believable.  However, during t</span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">he latter half of the twentieth century, and particularly since the beginning of the twenty-first century</span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">, the play has undergone a resurgence in popularity, possibly because the violence depicted in the play no longer seems unbelievable.  Although we live in a time that is actually less violent than in the past, we have unprecedented access to images of extreme violence, depicted in television shows like </span><i style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Game of Thrones</i><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">, and in real–world events.  </span></p><p>This year in particular seems an appropriate year for this play, with its attention to the issues of rape, extreme violence, and racism.  Just under a year ago, the Isla Vista shooter expressed sentiments of hatred, desire for chaos, and racial otherness that bear similarity to those of the character Aaron, as well as simultaneous woman-desiring and woman-hating feelings similar to those of Tamora’s sons, Chiron and Demetrius, toward Titus’s daughter, Lavinia.  Furthermore, anyone with Youtube access is able to witness the extreme violence and deliberate cruelty of ISIS.  Finally, the theme of racism in <i>Titus</i> is shockingly relevant this year.  Despite being one of Shakespeare's earliest plays, <i>Titus</i> <i>Andronicus</i> can feel surprisingly modern.</p>
<p>Whereas violence in television and film is often more graphic than violence depicted on stage, live theatre has a unique ability to jar us from a sense of complacency towards it.  In the theatre, audience members share not only a physical space with actors, but also a powerful experience together in real time.  That is part of the magic of theatre and part of the value of this particular play.  </p><p>Our wonderful director Ray Salcedo, who brought us <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i> last year, is emphasizing the humanity of this play and combining aesthetic elements that are distinctly ancient and classical with those that are edgy and modern, highlighting the distinct Roman setting of the play while giving a nod to the timelessness of its themes. </p><p></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We’re bringing this play to a mixed English-speaking and Korean-speaking audience, and the play will be performed in English with Korean surtitles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>What are you all doing in Korea?</b></p>
<p>South Korea can be a wonderful place to be an artist.  Many of the people in our company at least originally came to Korea to teach English, or music, or theatre, etc., and these kinds of jobs allow them to support themselves while having time to pursue artistic activities.  However, for that to happen, we need artistic organizations like Seoul Shakespeare Company to provide these kinds of opportunities.  Various English-speaking theatre companies have come and gone in the last few years here because the expat community is so transient.  Right now the Seoul theatre community is down to just two theatre companies, Seoul Players and Seoul Shakespeare Company, which means that what we do in this company has become even more vitally important to our theatre community.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Why is Seoul Shakespeare Company important?</b></p>
<p>Seoul Shakespeare Company serves three different groups of people, making Shakespeare widely accessible to audiences and artists alike.  </p><p>First, we’re a unique resource for Korean audiences, though largely unknown and untapped at this point.  Shakespeare is widely taught in Korea, and widely performed in Korean translation, but we are the only theatre company in Seoul that performs Shakespeare in its original language, which is a very different experience from a performance in translation<b>.  </b></p>
<p>Secondly, Seoul has a large English-speaking expat population, many of whom would like to see theatre regularly but have few chances to see live theatre performed in English, aside from big touring shows.  For them, we’re an important part of the local artistic community.  </p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The third group of people that we serve are the people directly involved in the production.  There are a lot of English-speaking theatre artists living in Seoul who are looking for opportunities to use and develop their talents.  A number of our past company members have gone on to pursue a career in the theatre, and one of our goals is to nurture the talent we have here in Seoul so that they can pursue a future theatre career.    </span><br/></p>
<p>Some of our actors actually work professionally as actors in Korea doing roles in Korean dramas and films, and also in the expat indie film scene.  Our company gives those actors a chance to explore classical material and to experience some of the greatest plays and roles ever written.  These are the kinds of roles that shape great actors, and we’re the only company here that gives English-speaking actors the opportunity to play those roles.  </p><p>For this production, we also have a wonderful voice and text coach, Amy Mihyang Ginther, who has been giving our actors additional training as well.  </p>
<p>Aside from our mainstage productions, we also offer educational workshops and small performances throughout the year to bring Shakespeare to more intimate local audiences.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>What is special about this year’s production, and where is the money going?</b></p>
<p>With this production, we are trying to attract larger general audiences and to become more widely recognized as a resource for Shakespeare in Korea.  W<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">e’ve therefore increased </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">our production values this year, particularly with our set. In the past, our sets have been pretty minimalistic, but this play is written for a stage that has at least two levels.  We have a wonderful set designer who specializes in carpentry, but we need to be able to afford the materials to realize his design.  Reaching our funding goal will allow us to realize the beautiful set that he has designed for us, which will help our company and also help further his career in set design. </span></p>
<p>We’re still keeping our production costs very reasonable, but there is no getting around the cost of renting a theatre space in Seoul.  The cost of everything else is completely overshadowed by the cost of our theatre.  That is really why we need this Indiegogo campaign.  The amount we are raising is about half of the total cost to rent our theatre, and it’s just something that we cannot get around or penny-pinch our way out of.  We are asking for your support to help us pay for our theatre space and bring this production to life.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>What is the long-term impact of this campaign?</b></p>
<p>When this company first started in 2010, it was a small group of people performing Shakespeare in places like bars, with machines behind the bar making loud noises--that kind of thing.  One of the goals that Lindsey Higgins, our previous artistic director, had for the company was to produce Shakespeare’s works in actual theatre spaces, beginning with our production of <i>Macbeth</i> in 2011. </p>
<p>In Seoul, however, theatres are very expensive.  The fundraising events that we typically hold throughout the year are usually enough to pay for props, costumes, printing, and rehearsal space, but paying for the theatre space has always been impossible without company members using their own resources.  We are trying to make this production the last one under this model, shifting our revenue toward ticket sales instead.  This year, with an eye toward long-term development, we are changing our budgeting approach by increasing the number of performances and trying to earn enough money from ticket sales this year for our next production’s theatre rental.  This means that this is our crunch year: we started the year with very little, and our budget this year is higher than in the past in order to have enough performances (and to sell enough tickets) to start a sustainable financial cycle of ticket sales.  This is why we need your support, but also why your support for this show will have an ongoing long-term impact.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>Thank you!</b></p><p>Thank you so much for your support in helping us make this production happen, and helping us take a major step in our company’s development.  For those of you not in Korea, we’ll be sure to have a video of the production available so that you can see the work you have helped bring to life. Thank you!</p><p><b><br/></b></p><b>Other ways you can help</b><p>Aside from backing our show directly, sharing this campaign on social media is one of the best ways you can help!  </p><p>If you have a Korean bank account, you can also contribute via bank transfer.  Your contribution won't show up in our Indiegogo total, but we can still send you the perks listed above.  Send us an email to let us know that you've contributed, and we can add you to our list of donors.  Here is a link to our bank information: <a href=""http://www.seoulshakespearecompany.org/contribute-via-bank-transfer"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.seoulshakespearecompany.org/contribu...</a>    <br/></p><p>You can also purchase Seoul Shakespeare Company products from our Cafepress store:  <a href=""http://www.cafepress.com/seoulshakespearecompanystore."" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">http://www.cafepress.com/seoulshakespearecompanystore.</a><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">  (We receive 20% of sales.)  </span></p><p>Finally, we have lots of videos on our Youtube page that are currently monetized with ads.  Want to help us without spending any money?  Browse our videos and share any you like.  The amount we receive per view is very small, but every little bit helps!  We have two Youtube channels: </p><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIkl2wZH1PiMmNQwdiW_r7Q/playlists?flow=grid&amp;view=1&amp;sort=lad"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.youtube.com/channel/UCIkl2wZH1PiMmNQwdiW_r7Q/playlists?flow=grid&amp;view=1&amp;sort=lad</a> (Our archive of performances; all are monetized.)</p><p>and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/lindseyjade223"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/user/lindseyjade223</a> (Only 2 videos are monetized, but check out the channel anyway!)</p><p><br/></p><p><b>Performance Information</b></p><p>SSC presents <i>Titus Andronicus</i> May 30-June 14, 2015, at Theater Egg and Nucleus (알과핵 소극장) in Seoul's theatre district, Daehangno/Hyehwa.   </p><p>For more information, please visit our website: <a href=""http://www.seoulshakespearecompany.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.seoulshakespearecompany.org</a> </p><p>And find us on Facebook here:</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/seoulshakespeare?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/seoulshakespeare?fref=ts</a></span></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><div>Director: Ray Salcedo<br/>Stage Manager: Hee Sunwoo<div>Artistic Director/Producer: Lauren Ash-Morgan<p></p>

What is Titus Andronicus, and why is it relevant today?
Titus Andronicus is a brutal but beautifully poignant play about the heads of two opposing families--the Roman general Titus, and the Queen of the Goths, Tamora--who each choose the path of revenge over mercy and are ultimately destroyed by that choice. Metamorphosis is a major theme in this play, and many of the characters undergo major transformations, physical or otherwise, but the most central transformation is that of the character of Titus, from a dispassionate follower of rules, authority, and ritual, to a feeling, hurting, passionate human being, who is capable of emotion-filled acts of violence.  
This is a provocative play about the themes of violence (including sexual violence), revenge, racism, and the concepts of barbarity versus civilization.  While these deep themes are sometimes overlooked in favor of an emphasis on the gore and grotesqueness of the play, they point to the play's--and Shakespeare's--underlying sense of humanity. Although Titus Andronicus was quite popular among Elizabethan audiences, it was maligned for centuries as too violent to be either respectable or believable.  However, during the latter half of the twentieth century, and particularly since the beginning of the twenty-first century, the play has undergone a resurgence in popularity, possibly because the violence depicted in the play no longer seems unbelievable.  Although we live in a time that is actually less violent than in the past, we have unprecedented access to images of extreme violence, depicted in television shows like Game of Thrones, and in real–world events.  This year in particular seems an appropriate year for this play, with its attention to the issues of rape, extreme violence, and racism.  Just under a year ago, the Isla Vista shooter expressed sentiments of hatred, desire for chaos, and racial otherness that bear similarity to those of the character Aaron, as well as simultaneous woman-desiring and woman-hating feelings similar to those of Tamora’s sons, Chiron and Demetrius, toward Titus’s daughter, Lavinia.  Furthermore, anyone with Youtube access is able to witness the extreme violence and deliberate cruelty of ISIS.  Finally, the theme of racism in Titus is shockingly relevant this year.  Despite being one of Shakespeare's earliest plays, Titus Andronicus can feel surprisingly modern.

<span>Here

year we want to give something back to those individuals and families through

VIA
Program was founded based on two truths:</span><br/></p><p><span><b>1.</b><span>  </span>Coping with Alzheime'rs
can be deeply isolating and lonely for both those diagnosed with Alzheimer's
and their families, but opportunities to socialize and build community with
others going through similar experiences can drastically improve spirits for
all involved.</span></p>
<p><b>2.</b><span>  </span>For those diagnosed
with Alzheimer’s, the opportunity to experience live performance as either
spectator or participant often disappears. Improvisation, however, is an ideal
artistic form for those suffering with Alzheimer’s Disease. Each scene can be
short, fun, and requires no rehearsal.  It’s a perfect creative outlet for
loved ones who live in the moment, though their memories may have escaped
them.  Live performance provides a sense of inclusion, community, and joy
for both audiences and participants.</p>
<p>With these two
truths in mind, V.I.A. will offer free improvisational theatre classes to
Calgarians living with Alzheimer’s and their family caregivers.  Led by
Calgary-based improviser Karen Johnson-Diamond and Verb Theatre Co-Artistic
Director Col Cseke, these classes will aim to bring some much needed and joyful
escape to families and individuals going through an emotionally and financially
challenging time at no cost to participants.<br/>
<br/>
<span>This
is a brand new program, and we need to ensure that we are approaching our new

I have a lot of ambitious dreams, but this is one that I want to come true. I want to direct a stage version of Hedwig and the Angry Inch!

<div>Every year on Puerto Rican day, I notoriously air my frustrations with the ensuing celebrations. We are a rich and complicated culture, and I've always felt that gets lost in the madness surrounding the parade, parties, and the like.</div>
<div>This year, instead of complaining, I figured: why talk the talk? I should DO something. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">So I came up with the following.</span>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">A poetry slam featuring some of the most talented Puerto Rican poets I know, along with featured music from some friends of Caribbean heritage and origin, and- get this- a live salsa band. It's going to be legit, guys.</span></div> </div> <div> <h3>Here's what we need.</h3>
<div>Right now, the funds we need go directly to renting out the Nuyorican Poets Cafe (I know, right?!) for the night of June 14th, and to pay the band I feel best fits the entire feel of the event. I would also like to stipend all featured performers. Tiny stipends, but stipends nonetheless. At it's most basic, the primary needs are for the space and the band if not all funds are met, but let's try!</div>

</div></div>","Guys. Guys. I have an idea.
Every year on Puerto Rican day, I notoriously air my frustrations with the ensuing celebrations. We are a rich and complicated culture, and I've always felt that gets lost in the madness surrounding the parade, parties, and the like.
This year, instead of complaining, I figured: why talk the talk? I should DO something. So I came up with the following.

A poetry slam featuring some of the most talented Puerto Rican poets I know, along with featured music from some friends of Caribbean heritage and origin, and- get this- a live salsa band. It's going to be legit, guys.   Here's what we need.
Right now, the funds we need go directly to renting out the Nuyorican Poets Cafe (I know, right?!) for the night of June 14th, and to pay the band I feel best fits the entire feel of the event. I would also like to stipend all featured performers. Tiny stipends, but stipends nonetheless. At it's most basic, the primary needs are for the space and the band if not all funds are met, but let's try!

<h3>Costs and You</h3>
<p>As stated above, we are looking for a production budget of $5,000. This budget is designed to cover the comprehensive costs of our production--everything from marketing, to set and costumes, to props, to venue rental costs.</p>
<p>Here are the details:</p>
<p>Our largest expense so far is the rental of our space. We are renting out a studio space usually reserved for photography and videography projects. The space is giving us a wonderfully reduced price of $2,500 for the entire run of our show.</p>
<p>Our marketing costs are another large part of our budget. We are finishing up a cinematic trailer for the production which will cost us around $500 for camera rentals, prop rentals, and costuming. Also included in our marketing costs is our brilliant marketing designer, <a href=""http://cmdugan.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CM Dugan</a>, who has designed many, many theatrical productions, who charged us a reduced price of $150. Finally, in terms of marketing, we need to produce our physical marketing materials (posters, postcards, business cards, etc.) which will run an estimated $500 all told.</p>
<p>Next, our set, props, and costume budget will be approximately $1000. We've done the math on the set, which will cost us around $300 for lumber, molding, and decoration. Costumes are difficult to estimate at this time, but we can't imagine a budget much higher than $500 all told, and a budget of $200 for props.</p>
<p>Other various costs have included the creation of our website, which has come to around $150 for hosting, building, and service.</p>
<p>Here is an itemized budget:</p>
<p>Property Rental: - $2,500</p>
<p>Marketing: - $1,150</p>
<p>Set: - $300</p>
<p>Costumes: - $500</p>
<p>Properties: - $200</p>
<p>Miscellaneous: - $150</p>
<p>Total: - $4,800</p>
<p>Our budget projection of $5,000 is designed to give us some cushion for unexpected costs, of which there are many in theatre.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Importance of <i>Ivanov</i>
</h3> <p>Chekhov was a hundred years ahead of his time. He is said to have written <i>Ivanov</i> in just ten days, before seeing it performed and almost completely rewriting the entire script claiming he couldn't recognize the words he wrote.</p>
<p><i>Ivanov</i> beautifully paints the picture of a man, Nikolai Ivanov, who is struggling with what we would today call clinical depression. However, in Chekhov's day, depression was not a neurological illness, but rather it was considered a state of mind--one of weak constitution, and one that could be overcome through sheer power of will. Depression is progressively becoming more understood by modern medicine, but much remains unknown about it, and about most emotional disorders. </p>
<p><i>Ivanov</i> also seriously considers the situation of suicide. For hundreds of years, philosophers literary and otherwise have speculated and mused on the idea of self-sacrifice and martyrdom, and conversely the selfishness of taking your own life. While Chekhov does not take sides on the issue, he does brilliantly illustrate a fact echoed by data and research that suicide is most often attempted successfully by a culmination of emotional turmoil and a sudden, random event. Most suicides are not premeditated or pre-planned. With so many events of celebrity suicide in the news recently, we think that both themes of depression and suicide are important, not only philosophically, but personally in a country so deeply riddled by emotional disorders and misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Also, especially in the United States, the world has been experiencing a recent period of disillusionment with the rich by not only the poor, but also the middle class, and even members of the 1% themselves. In Chekhov's day, Russia was going through the decades leading up to the Bolshevik Revolution--an iconoclastic overthrow of the Russian Upper Class. In the same way, America went through an exacerbated period of unrest in the 1920's, which may have led to a revolution of its own if it hadn't been for the stock market crash and the Depression that followed. For this reason, we've chosen to design our production in a setting reminiscent of the 1920's in the United States.</p>
<p>All of this, and the text itself makes us extremely excited about this project. We hope that you are more in tune with our goals and message. Feel free to give us your thoughts on the subject: we will take what you say to heart while rehearsing and building this incredible show.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Challenges Facing <i>Ivanov</i>
</h3> <p>Primarily, the challenges we face are financial ones. We do not have the personal capital available to pay for this production at the level we want to see it done. If it wasn't for all of your support, this project would not be possible. To offset the possibility of not reaching our goals, we will be applying for a grant through the city of Hartford, but as these grants are hard to come by, we are truly relying on you and your generosity to pull us through.</p>
<p>We are also doing everything ourselves. We are designing our set, building it by hand, painting it, papering it, moving it into the space, gathering furniture, costumes, and props ourselves, and setting up all of our marketing and web builds on our own. We are experienced in all of these things--all of us have worked on the back stage side of things with experience in set design, set construction, property management and acquisition, costume construction and design, and marketing. Through both our in depth education at the <a href=""http://harttweb.hartford.edu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hartt School</a>, and many, many productions under our belts, we are prepared to deal with all of these issues and more.</p>
<p>If we cannot solve any of these problems ourselves, we also have the luxury of excellent connections, who can guide us to solutions on any issues we might face, from former directors, to professionals in the field, to family with great success in the business. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>How You Can Help</h3> <p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help. The best thing you can do for us is to shout out loud about <i>Ivanov</i> and share it with as many people as you can! Share it on Facebook, share it on Twitter, share it in an email, share it in a text, it doesn't matter to us! Just get that word out there for us, and thank you so much for your contribution to this incredible project, We look forward to meeting you on opening night!</p>

</h3><div><br/></div><h3>What are we creating?</h3><p>This is the first step on the road to creating something that’s not often seen in our corner of the world: an independent, grassroots opera project, created by a pair of new writers, and (ultimately) brought to life by some of Halifax’s most promising emerging performers.  </p><p>This is a story we’ve always wanted to tell, brought to life through a uniquely vibrant, engaging medium that combines the twin strengths of drama and music.  </p><blockquote><p>“Two hundred and eighty six years have passed since the Great War ravaged the earth; one hundred and ninety seven since the founding of Scientia among the ruins of a city once part of Nova Scotia. Here, the radiation isn’t as strong. Our water needs only minor purification, and under controlled settings, plants can grow without contamination. Built on the promise that through science we could solve all of our problems, the city of Scientia could not afford to ignore the effect of radiation on unborn life. Reproduction, a dangerous trial since the advent of the war, became a state-controlled affair: conception, a routine procedure performed by dispassionate doctors. At the age of twenty we partner – either with a partner of our choice, or one appointed by the state. At twenty-one, we give birth to our first of two required children.”</p></blockquote><p>Based on a short story by Emilie Hurst, this is the story of Lucy, a young cis woman living in a future society where resources are rationed, knowledge is tightly controlled, and reproduction is mandatory.  Though she submits to the medical procedure that’s said to be 99.9 percent effective in causing pregnancy, it slowly becomes apparent that something is wrong. Who, she wonders, are the 0.1 percent? What happens to them, and what does that mean for her?<br/></p><p>We’ve sometimes referred to this piece as “a feminist science fiction opera” - and it’s all of those things and more.  Like all good science fiction, it asks difficult questions about our own world, and, ultimately, about ourselves.  What is the value of a person’s life when they can’t contribute in the way that’s set out for them by their society? What is the extent of the damage done by a system that’s unsympathetic to those who fall through the cracks? In an age where politicians moralise over reproductive rights, and where we engage every day with the commodification of women’s bodies, this is a story that we feel is increasingly relevant.  For opera fans, it could be a breath of fresh air in a genre full of cherished classics.  For those who’ve come for the story, it could be a chance to engage with a new medium in a way they might not have experienced before.</p><h3>Who are we?</h3><ul><li>
<b>Emilie Hurst (librettist)</b> is an academic and creative writer living in Ottawa.  Raised in the Maritimes, she has a degree in Music and Creative Writing from Dalhousie University, and is currently completing a Master’s thesis which deals with, among other things, the use of music in Doctor Who.  She will be pursuing doctoral studies at York University in the fall.</li></ul><ul><li>
<b>Michael Robson (composer)</b> creates theatre and concert music that fuses contemporary sensibilities with elements of early music.  Based in Halifax, Nova Scotia, he has contributed incidental music and song settings to The Villain’s Theatre and the King’s Theatrical Society, and directs the student-run Unconscious Collective Vocal Ensemble.  Michael holds a Bachelor of Music (Composition) from Dalhousie University, where he studied with Jérôme Blais and Scott Edward Godin.</li></ul><h3>Why Crowdfunding?</h3><blockquote>“When we arrive home, Tom reveals he was busy while I slept, and pulls from a brown paper bag two carrots, a head of lettuce and a single tomato. I gasp at the expenditure – fresh produce is a rare commodity – and take the tomato in my hand to feel the elastic skin. On an impulse I take a bite. The tart juice drips onto my shirt, but I cannot bring myself to care. Tom laughs, and offers me a cloth before pulling out a final gift, a flat parcel poorly wrapped in brown paper.”<br/>
</blockquote><p>This project is really dear to both of us.  We’ve had it on the table for a few years now (since we both finished our undergrads, in fact), but every time we bring it up, it gets forced once again to the back burner, whether due to conflicting projects, asynchronous life plans, or - most of all - our various day jobs getting in the way.  And there’s the rub - this kind of project requires a full-time commitment of several months at least, and, being twenty-somethings who are still in the process of getting established, taking that amount of time off with no steady income just isn’t feasible.  In short, the funds raised by this campaign are going to allow Emilie to pay rent and buy groceries for the two or three months it takes to get our bearings and produce a workable, usable text.  This is a timely, relevant, compelling story that we really want to bring to life, but we can’t starve while we’re doing it.<br/></p><p>This campaign is a jumping-off point - the first step in a long series of things that we need to make happen in order to bring this project to fruition.  At this stage, our story only exists in the realm of pen, paper, and plain text files; we have no free album downloads, no cool gadgets to show off, no hand-drawn artwork or DVD bonus material to share.  But we hope that contributing to us will be like planting a seed which you can watch growing as we continue to develop this project; in return, we’ll share the results of our work as it happens, and with it, a bit of ourselves.</p><p></p><h3>Where do we go from here?</h3><blockquote>“As we walk through the streets of Scientia, I notice how the city core seems stitched together, new square angled constructions contrasting with the makeshift project of the early founders. When we move towards the edge of the city, the houses slowly morph into a standardized form, grey concrete and white doors, until I feel as if we are caught between two mirrors, the same unit reflected back to us eternally. I busy myself with cataloguing the small discrepancies…”<br/>
</blockquote><p>Once we have a libretto, then comes the all-important composition process, in which our story is retold - again - in the language of flowing vocal melodies and colourful orchestrations, transforming it from a narrative poem into an honest-to-goodness opera score.  This is the main part of creating the work that we want to create, and will (hopefully) be funded through Arts Nova Scotia’s Grants To Individuals program.  The grant application will be submitted in early May, and we should know by mid-July whether it’s been approved - which should allow the composition process to start in late July / early August, and to continue for the next 4-6 months.  <i>(NB: Just so we’re perfectly clear, the libretto process - being primarily Emilie’s work - isn’t eligible for for this grant, as she’s continuing to pursue graduate / doctoral studies - hence, this campaign.)</i><br/></p><p>With a completed score in hand, our next step will be to put the story into the hands of performers and hear it for the first time.  We’re aiming to do this in summer 2016; most likely, it will take the form of a semi-staged workshop performance.  If all goes well, we’ll start soliciting support for a fully staged production, to be developed over the following year.</p><h3>Why this project?</h3><blockquote>“As I step out into the unknown landscape, my ears pick up on the faint hum of the wind turbines, usually barely audible within the city walls. I stand for a moment, letting the sound wrap around me…”<br/>
</blockquote><p>Beyond just telling a story that matters, we see this project as filling a hole within Halifax’s vibrant arts community.  Halifax has a flourishing independent theatre scene, and is famous for the creativity and diversity of its music, but opera - possibly the most exciting and multifaceted of all forms of live performance - remains the provenance of universities and arts organisations.

Check out the update tab above for the details on a bonus perk which we will offer to all backers if we can make it there!
What are we creating?This is the first step on the road to creating something that’s not often seen in our corner of the world: an independent, grassroots opera project, created by a pair of new writers, and (ultimately) brought to life by some of Halifax’s most promising emerging performers.  This is a story we’ve always wanted to tell, brought to life through a uniquely vibrant, engaging medium that combines the twin strengths of drama and music.  “Two hundred and eighty six years have passed since the Great War ravaged the earth; one hundred and ninety seven since the founding of Scientia among the ruins of a city once part of Nova Scotia. Here, the radiation isn’t as strong. Our water needs only minor purification, and under controlled settings, plants can grow without contamination. Built on the promise that through science we could solve all of our problems, the city of Scientia could not afford to ignore the effect of radiation on unborn life. Reproduction, a dangerous trial since the advent of the war, became a state-controlled affair: conception, a routine procedure performed by dispassionate doctors. At the age of twenty we partner – either with a partner of our choice, or one appointed by the state. At twenty-one, we give birth to our first of two required children.”Based on a short story by Emilie Hurst, this is the story of Lucy, a young cis woman living in a future society where resources are rationed, knowledge is tightly controlled, and reproduction is mandatory.  Though she submits to the medical procedure that’s said to be 99.9 percent effective in causing pregnancy, it slowly becomes apparent that something is wrong. Who, she wonders, are the 0.1 percent? What happens to them, and what does that mean for her?We’ve sometimes referred to this piece as “a feminist science fiction opera” - and it’s all of those things and more.  Like all good science fiction, it asks difficult questions about our own world, and, ultimately, about ourselves.  What is the value of a person’s life when they can’t contribute in the way that’s set out for them by their society? What is the extent of the damage done by a system that’s unsympathetic to those who fall through the cracks? In an age where politicians moralise over reproductive rights, and where we engage every day with the commodification of women’s bodies, this is a story that we feel is increasingly relevant.  For opera fans, it could be a breath of fresh air in a genre full of cherished classics.  For those who’ve come for the story, it could be a chance to engage with a new medium in a way they might not have experienced before.Who are we?
Emilie Hurst (librettist) is an academic and creative writer living in Ottawa.  Raised in the Maritimes, she has a degree in Music and Creative Writing from Dalhousie University, and is currently completing a Master’s thesis which deals with, among other things, the use of music in Doctor Who.  She will be pursuing doctoral studies at York University in the fall.
Michael Robson (composer) creates theatre and concert music that fuses contemporary sensibilities with elements of early music.  Based in Halifax, Nova Scotia, he has contributed incidental music and song settings to The Villain’s Theatre and the King’s Theatrical Society, and directs the student-run Unconscious Collective Vocal Ensemble.  Michael holds a Bachelor of Music (Composition) from Dalhousie University, where he studied with Jérôme Blais and Scott Edward Godin.Why Crowdfunding?“When we arrive home, Tom reveals he was busy while I slept, and pulls from a brown paper bag two carrots, a head of lettuce and a single tomato. I gasp at the expenditure – fresh produce is a rare commodity – and take the tomato in my hand to feel the elastic skin. On an impulse I take a bite. The tart juice drips onto my shirt, but I cannot bring myself to care. Tom laughs, and offers me a cloth before pulling out a final gift, a flat parcel poorly wrapped in brown paper.”
This project is really dear to both of us.  We’ve had it on the table for a few years now (since we both finished our undergrads, in fact), but every time we bring it up, it gets forced once again to the back burner, whether due to conflicting projects, asynchronous life plans, or - most of all - our various day jobs getting in the way.  And there’s the rub - this kind of project requires a full-time commitment of several months at least, and, being twenty-somethings who are still in the process of getting established, taking that amount of time off with no steady income just isn’t feasible.  In short, the funds raised by this campaign are going to allow Emilie to pay rent and buy groceries for the two or three months it takes to get our bearings and produce a workable, usable text.  This is a timely, relevant, compelling story that we really want to bring to life, but we can’t starve while we’re doing it.This campaign is a jumping-off point - the first step in a long series of things that we need to make happen in order to bring this project to fruition.  At this stage, our story only exists in the realm of pen, paper, and plain text files; we have no free album downloads, no cool gadgets to show off, no hand-drawn artwork or DVD bonus material to share.  But we hope that contributing to us will be like planting a seed which you can watch growing as we continue to develop this project; in return, we’ll share the results of our work as it happens, and with it, a bit of ourselves.Where do we go from here?“As we walk through the streets of Scientia, I notice how the city core seems stitched together, new square angled constructions contrasting with the makeshift project of the early founders. When we move towards the edge of the city, the houses slowly morph into a standardized form, grey concrete and white doors, until I feel as if we are caught between two mirrors, the same unit reflected back to us eternally. I busy myself with cataloguing the small discrepancies…”
Once we have a libretto, then comes the all-important composition process, in which our story is retold - again - in the language of flowing vocal melodies and colourful orchestrations, transforming it from a narrative poem into an honest-to-goodness opera score.  This is the main part of creating the work that we want to create, and will (hopefully) be funded through Arts Nova Scotia’s Grants To Individuals program.  The grant application will be submitted in early May, and we should know by mid-July whether it’s been approved - which should allow the composition process to start in late July / early August, and to continue for the next 4-6 months.  (NB: Just so we’re perfectly clear, the libretto process - being primarily Emilie’s work - isn’t eligible for for this grant, as she’s continuing to pursue graduate / doctoral studies - hence, this campaign.)With a completed score in hand, our next step will be to put the story into the hands of performers and hear it for the first time.  We’re aiming to do this in summer 2016; most likely, it will take the form of a semi-staged workshop performance.  If all goes well, we’ll start soliciting support for a fully staged production, to be developed over the following year.Why this project?“As I step out into the unknown landscape, my ears pick up on the faint hum of the wind turbines, usually barely audible within the city walls. I stand for a moment, letting the sound wrap around me…”
Beyond just telling a story that matters, we see this project as filling a hole within Halifax’s vibrant arts community.  Halifax has a flourishing independent theatre scene, and is famous for the creativity and diversity of its music, but opera - possibly the most exciting and multifaceted of all forms of live performance - remains the provenance of universities and arts organisations. Young Halifax singers overwhelmingly go elsewhere to specialise and pursue performance careers.  It would be wonderful to see Halifax build a bridge between the two worlds - a vibrant young independent opera scene with one foot in the university community and the other in the theatre world, where we tell our own stories about people and places that matter to us, where new work is celebrated and forms the backbone of what we do, holding a mirror up to the classics that we know and love.But right now, there is no infrastructure that will help us tell the story that we want to tell.  So it’s up to you - if you find any of this intriguing, or if you like the direction we’re going, you can help us build the boat that will test these uncharted waters.I want this to happen, but I’m a starving artist too.As with anything, please keep watching us and share this widely! This is a project with a tremendous amount of crossover potential, so if you know anyone who’s interested in any aspect of this work - whether it’s opera, theatre, music, science fiction, or social commentary - send them our way.  If you’re interested in getting involved at a later stage of this project, feel free to get in touch!

<p>WORKSHOP with Diego Pinon</p>
<p>Butoh Ritual Mexicano (BRM) challenges us to awaken
and explore all the human qualities ranging from the subtle to the outrageous.
BRM seeks the emergence of the deeper self. Through this process of
transforming our daily life through the rebirth of our dance, we can offer more
inspired energy to our community. BRM training involves high-impact aerobic
movement, active meditation, and guided improvisation, all embraced within a
space of communal ritual. The collective physical training consists of shaking,
low-level ground work, partnering, impulse exchange, and transpersonal
communication in order to expand our currents of energetic exchange. Guided
improvisations then give participants the opportunity to integrate this
new-found sensory awareness within their physical body, external environments,
and the collective presence to reach new realms of creative potential.</p>

</div><br/></div>","Dance on the Lawn is back for for a second year of free dance performances in northern New Jersey. 
And this year, we're bigger and better than before:  



We've rounded up more dance companies -- a full dozen -- to perform free of charge on the lawn at St. Luke's Episcopal Church on Saturday, Sept. 12th at 4.30pm. 


 We've launched an ""Emerging New Jersey Choreographer"" program, to develop and mentor new artists.  This year's DOTL will feature a specially commissioned performance by our very first Emerging Choreographer, Robert Mark Burke.  


 Who We Are  Dance on the Lawn is a small, all-volunteer organization dedicated to exposing everyone -- especially folks intimidated by enormous ticket prices and fancy theaters -- to the glory of dance in all its forms.  We present an annual dance festival, free of charge.  This year, we have added a mentorship program for young artists, awarding a $1000 stipend to an ""Emerging New Jersey Choreographer.""  

Our founder, Charmaine Warren, has performed with several New York dance companies and is a former faculty member at The Ailey School, Fordham University, and the Joffrey Ballet.  She curates dance festivals for Harlem Stage and the Wassiac Project.  This past year, DOTL has grown to include an entire team of volunteers are are working hard to help make DOTL 2015 a success.  
Charmaine is ferociously committed to the power of dance to move us, to change our perspectives, and to enlarge our sense of empathy and compassion.  She is passionate about sharing that power, and started Dance on the Lawn to help give everyone a chance to see and feel how a little dance can rock your world.  

What We Need  Dance on the Lawn has received support from local community organizations in Montclair, NJ (where we are based), including  Toni’s Kitchen, Studio042, The Spoon Group, and TonyTurnerPhotography.  This year, we have added Investor's Bank and Dance New Jersey to our roster of supporters.  


Our support is mostly the ""in-kind"" variety -- we will perform in donated space, on a donated stage with a donated Marley floor, donated microphones and donated speakers.  The fabulous dancers who agreed to perform said YES!, knowing that DOTL has no money to pay them.  We started this campaign to help raise funds to pay the artists. 




99% of all funds we raise will go directly to the dancers.  (The other 1% will be used for administrative/logistical things like Gaffer's tape, ice and water for the dancers, and renewing our domain name)

<h3>The Inspiration of Maui Circus &amp; Parkour Studio </h3>
<div>
<b><i>Aloha</i></b>~ My name is Halle, I am an extremely passionate, hard working individual and a  believer that movement and energy create love and inspiration in everyone. I know Parkour, aerials and circus arts provide so much more than just fitness! They inspire greater creativity, boost self-confidence, bring people together, and make exercise FUN! </div>
<div>In teaching aerials here on the island of Maui, I observed the demand for these programs that I know will provide invaluable tools for the community. There is a need and I have the skills, support network, heart and passion to make this happen. </div>
<div>I'm truly called to this mission of creating <b>Maui Circus &amp; Parkour</b>. It's a BIG mission, and I'm grateful for all your support! Read on for more about me and our team.</div>

<p>I knew when I was 5 that I wanted  to be a circus <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">performer. I started young, making my own clown costumes and juggling. I even built my very own stilts when I was 9.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I've always been a </span>passionate,<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> motivated, agile, mechanically minded person. For the past 5 years I have  reconnected with my dream of circus </span>and movement. I've <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">traveled around - training, learning, teaching and performing aerials and circus arts, sprinkling in some Parkour on the side, and building some pretty profound relationships with amazingly talented successful athletes, performers, and business owners. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">My training, certifications and dedication go above and beyond. I have also spent the last 12 years as a tower climber, mechanic, welder &amp; high rigger/stage rigger. I have been working in the most dangerous industry in America and take my safety, work, and goals very seriously. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">To me, safety and following through are as important as my love for movement and fun. Our studio will have all the necessary safety equipment and policies. I believe in open communication and promise to be someone the community can rely on. I want to see people fall in love with creative movement! </span></p>

The Inspiration of Maui Circus & Parkour Studio 

Aloha~ My name is Halle, I am an extremely passionate, hard working individual and a  believer that movement and energy create love and inspiration in everyone. I know Parkour, aerials and circus arts provide so much more than just fitness! They inspire greater creativity, boost self-confidence, bring people together, and make exercise FUN! 
In teaching aerials here on the island of Maui, I observed the demand for these programs that I know will provide invaluable tools for the community. There is a need and I have the skills, support network, heart and passion to make this happen. 
I'm truly called to this mission of creating Maui Circus & Parkour. It's a BIG mission, and I'm grateful for all your support! Read on for more about me and our team.

                           



                                      


I knew when I was 5 that I wanted  to be a circus performer. I started young, making my own clown costumes and juggling. I even built my very own stilts when I was 9.
I've always been a passionate, motivated, agile, mechanically minded person. For the past 5 years I have  reconnected with my dream of circus and movement. I've traveled around - training, learning, teaching and performing aerials and circus arts, sprinkling in some Parkour on the side, and building some pretty profound relationships with amazingly talented successful athletes, performers, and business owners. 
My training, certifications and dedication go above and beyond. I have also spent the last 12 years as a tower climber, mechanic, welder & high rigger/stage rigger. I have been working in the most dangerous industry in America and take my safety, work, and goals very seriously. 
To me, safety and following through are as important as my love for movement and fun. Our studio will have all the necessary safety equipment and policies. I believe in open communication and promise to be someone the community can rely on. I want to see people fall in love with creative movement! 

  




Examples of what we are building: Bigger the better!











And some fun!

Risks & Challenges
Being passionate means Taking Risks
Every move with aerials and Parkour is a risk and a challenge. That is why it takes time, patience, determination and passion to build up strengths. 
I anticipate the same models in opening the doors to this studio. We are taking this risk and accepting the challenge. We have an amazing support system of professionals that have our backs. We will embrace any challenges and create strengths through them.

Once we raise these funds we will be positioned to sustain as a business; however, we are keenly aware that the work is just beginning. Running a Parkour and aerial studio involves a lot of overhead costs. We are committed to being fiscally healthy so that MCPS can thrive. We will pay a living wage and have comprehensive insurance for our studio and programming.   
Your active support of MCPS is essential for our success. Sign up for our classes, camps and workshops! Engage in our wonderful workshops for traveling or local professionals and aspiring performers, stunt artists, ninja warriors and circus creatives.  
It is our responsibility to offer the best possible instruction and opportunities so that you want to be at MCPS. Ultimately, our success will be a result of Maui seizing this opportunity as a community and creating some ripples.
It is our passionate intention that we fully fund our campaign with your support! However, if we do not meet our campaign goal, we will start with a smaller space and less equipment and build it up as we grow. 
The seed is planted. The roots will grow. The talent, passion and experience will prove itself, and create ripples.

Other Ways You Can Help 
You can help us by spreading the word! Share this campaign with a few other people you think might be in the position to give!

<h2><i><strong>The Scoop on <u>SPRINGLOADED </u></strong></i></h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485827804/docqnwzwssrsfg7fghyh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>There are no mistakes in this world. If I hadn't stalled and gotten stuck, in my life as well as with my show; if I'd finished my show sooner, I wouldn't have had my story; not even close. Why? Because the woman I am, despite clawing the air, spinning like a top and lamentations - had to be just as I am today in order to know how to unravel the skein and learn what I can.</p>
<p> When I was 11, maybe 12, my sister Judith and I had a nightly tradition. We perched on my bed next to the open window, leaned on the sill and peered out to the shadowed street. Air mics in hand, we delivered the <strong><i>Up to the Minute Report</i></strong><i>. (""attention all chipmunks! There's a new crow causing trouble all over the block - be careful out there!""). </i></p>
<p>Well, <strong>SPRINGLOADED</strong> is my present day <strong><i>Up to the Minute Report.                                             </i></strong><i> ""Now where did those 35 years run off to? When did I lose my faith in possibility, in myself? What do I do to get those years back? And what about my lost faith?  How, where do I look for that? And she turns to her past, younger selves for help. If she's lucky, maybe even a few answers</i></p>
<p>As for the genesis of it all - I got the idea to write a one-woman show - wait for it- over 25 years ago. I figured the idea made good sense:<span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'> </span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489570508/wy3twqo8hvb0ucde4yk2.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>I'd worked as an actor most all my adult life;         <strong>1) </strong></span></p>

<p><span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'> last but definitely not least,   I have an enormously, um - colorful - back story. ""Easy peasy"", I  thought, and I got right to  work. Drawing on the aforementioned back story, I wrote about a dozen vignettes, named the piece <u><i><strong>DIGS</strong></i></u> and  performed it in a <strong><i><u>Cornerstone Theatre</u> </i></strong>workshop. I didn't put any  music in the first incarnation of my show, but I could hear the whole soundtrack-I knew which songs I'd use that I'd already written, like <i><strong>Runner...</strong></i></span></p>

<p><span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>I knew where in the story I'd need to write something new, I heard how and where the songs would fit. It was  the most <i>exciting</i> feeling. That whole year I was charged and optimistic; I wrote three, then four new songs that fit my show perfectly, like <strong><i>No Applause...</i></strong></span></p>

<p>At the same time, I was prepping to begin recording my first independent album project, <b>Gravity of the Heart. </b>with my pal, <strong>Mike Clinco. </strong>Mike and I went on to collaborate on two new songs for my show: <i><strong>25</strong></i> and <i><strong>14. </strong></i>They're still two of my absolute favorite songs :<strong> </strong><strong>5) </strong><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/margot-rose/%20%20springloaded25-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://acquaintance.com/margot-rose/ springloaded25-1</a> </p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">During this time, I was also lucky enough to be getting fabulous TV bookings. Definitely the best and most exciting of these jobs was on <i><strong>Star Trek, The Next Generation</strong></i> as Eline in <i><strong>The Inner Light. </strong></i>I couldn't have wished for a better role. To this day, it's one of the best roles I ever had the good fortune to play on TV.                                                                                           <strong>                                                                                                                                                                             (6 </strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490453058/qkiqeozwwh0dznw3emjb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I think most every artist experiences times that are more fertile than others. For me, the years in the early 1990's definitely were one of those times. But our fortunes tend to rise and fall like the tides; terrific times seem to even out with more challenging ones. Before I got too comfortable with all my good fortune, I hit several chapters of<strong> </strong>that<strong> </strong><i>evening out</i> time - first, it came dressed as a crippling, ridiculously hard-to-diagnose chronic illness. This took my attention for the better part of 5 years - and my show gathered dust. When I'd pushed away from my island of illness, my partner Pat and I got serious about creating a family (yep, I'm gay). After four plus years of shots in the butt, insemination, and finally In Vitro Fertilization, she gave birth to our twins, Will and Nora. Now <i>THIS </i>was (and still is) a real quality problem. But twins don't leave a lot of elective time; when a few minutes do turn up, one usually opts for a shower or a meal. And so my show gathered an even thicker layer of dust.  </p>
<p>As the kids sprouted, my focus began to expand. For the first time in years, my field of vision included more than two small people. At the same time, the need to finish what I started began to preoccupy my kid-centric brain. The desire to get back to my artist self spread like heat from a hot plate. So I warily ventured out to a few tiny clubs for the first time in ages; songwriter rounds and short sets. I swallowed my pride, bitch-slapped my ego and forced myself to go to some open-mic nights (<strong>Me</strong>: Do<i>n't they know who I am?<i> </i><strong>Me :</strong> Well, it's been every bit of 15 years, babe, so that would be a </i><u><i>no</i>)</u>. I went back to my stories, added more, retooled what I'd written before. I moved forward, then stalled once again.                     </p>
<p>In the story of my story, the saga goes on; more illness, more conflict, enormous love, crippling heartbreak, paralyzing hurt, all-encompassing fear; all shot through with the joy, frustration and frequent overwhelm of having kids. And like so many stories, especially true ones, there are stories within the stories within the stories, like Russian nesting dolls.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say the twists and turns of life as well as the monsters in residence under my bed kept the road blocks coming like whack-a-moles.</p>
<p>So, here it is all these years later - and I'm finally,<i> finally </i>ready to jump off the cliff, no matter where I land.</p>
<p>I'm asking <strong><i>you</i></strong>, my family, my family of friends and my friends unmet, to help me get my butt to the finish line and get my show <strong>ON ITS FEET!</strong></p>
<p><strong>(my</strong> <strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490233201/cchvsld2hqcufi8ou6fl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/> feet)</strong></p>

</div></div>","The Scoop on SPRINGLOADED 

There are no mistakes in this world. If I hadn't stalled and gotten stuck, in my life as well as with my show; if I'd finished my show sooner, I wouldn't have had my story; not even close. Why? Because the woman I am, despite clawing the air, spinning like a top and lamentations - had to be just as I am today in order to know how to unravel the skein and learn what I can.
 When I was 11, maybe 12, my sister Judith and I had a nightly tradition. We perched on my bed next to the open window, leaned on the sill and peered out to the shadowed street. Air mics in hand, we delivered the Up to the Minute Report. (""attention all chipmunks! There's a new crow causing trouble all over the block - be careful out there!""). 
Well, SPRINGLOADED is my present day Up to the Minute Report.                                              ""Now where did those 35 years run off to? When did I lose my faith in possibility, in myself? What do I do to get those years back? And what about my lost faith?  How, where do I look for that? And she turns to her past, younger selves for help. If she's lucky, maybe even a few answers
As for the genesis of it all - I got the idea to write a one-woman show - wait for it- over 25 years ago. I figured the idea made good sense: I'd worked as an actor most all my adult life;         1) 
as a singer-songwriter, playing in the clubs throughout LA, my  tunes were invariably, achingly autobiographical;
 (2
 last but definitely not least,   I have an enormously, um - colorful - back story. ""Easy peasy"", I  thought, and I got right to  work. Drawing on the aforementioned back story, I wrote about a dozen vignettes, named the piece DIGS and  performed it in a Cornerstone Theatre workshop. I didn't put any  music in the first incarnation of my show, but I could hear the whole soundtrack-I knew which songs I'd use that I'd already written, like Runner...

I knew where in the story I'd need to write something new, I heard how and where the songs would fit. It was  the most exciting feeling. That whole year I was charged and optimistic; I wrote three, then four new songs that fit my show perfectly, like No Applause...

At the same time, I was prepping to begin recording my first independent album project, Gravity of the Heart. with my pal, Mike Clinco. Mike and I went on to collaborate on two new songs for my show: 25 and 14. They're still two of my absolute favorite songs : 5) https://acquaintance.com/margot-rose/ springloaded25-1 
During this time, I was also lucky enough to be getting fabulous TV bookings. Definitely the best and most exciting of these jobs was on Star Trek, The Next Generation as Eline in The Inner Light. I couldn't have wished for a better role. To this day, it's one of the best roles I ever had the good fortune to play on TV.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        (6 
I think most every artist experiences times that are more fertile than others. For me, the years in the early 1990's definitely were one of those times. But our fortunes tend to rise and fall like the tides; terrific times seem to even out with more challenging ones. Before I got too comfortable with all my good fortune, I hit several chapters of that evening out time - first, it came dressed as a crippling, ridiculously hard-to-diagnose chronic illness. This took my attention for the better part of 5 years - and my show gathered dust. When I'd pushed away from my island of illness, my partner Pat and I got serious about creating a family (yep, I'm gay). After four plus years of shots in the butt, insemination, and finally In Vitro Fertilization, she gave birth to our twins, Will and Nora. Now THIS was (and still is) a real quality problem. But twins don't leave a lot of elective time; when a few minutes do turn up, one usually opts for a shower or a meal. And so my show gathered an even thicker layer of dust.  
As the kids sprouted, my focus began to expand. For the first time in years, my field of vision included more than two small people. At the same time, the need to finish what I started began to preoccupy my kid-centric brain. The desire to get back to my artist self spread like heat from a hot plate. So I warily ventured out to a few tiny clubs for the first time in ages; songwriter rounds and short sets. I swallowed my pride, bitch-slapped my ego and forced myself to go to some open-mic nights (Me: Don't they know who I am? Me : Well, it's been every bit of 15 years, babe, so that would be a no). I went back to my stories, added more, retooled what I'd written before. I moved forward, then stalled once again.                     
In the story of my story, the saga goes on; more illness, more conflict, enormous love, crippling heartbreak, paralyzing hurt, all-encompassing fear; all shot through with the joy, frustration and frequent overwhelm of having kids. And like so many stories, especially true ones, there are stories within the stories within the stories, like Russian nesting dolls.
Suffice it to say the twists and turns of life as well as the monsters in residence under my bed kept the road blocks coming like whack-a-moles.
So, here it is all these years later - and I'm finally, finally ready to jump off the cliff, no matter where I land.
I'm asking you, my family, my family of friends and my friends unmet, to help me get my butt to the finish line and get my show ON ITS FEET!
(my  feet)
With enormous love and my forever gratitude,
xo Margot

PS - a small gift: I wrote this song as part of a musical based on a children's book; it may or may not find its way into SPRINGLOADED. Either way, it's all about magic. Everything that's happening lately? It's the miracle I always heard I should stick around for- just another word for magic. 
                                                                                                 I freakin' love magic.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>For ASF's 5th anniversary season we have plowed ahead with a two show season.  We hope you will assist us as we continue to put works on stage that helps break down the terrible stereotypes that exist about Arabs and Muslims in our world today.  Over the previous four years we have produced two distinctly Arab stories: <i>We Made Bread</i>, a one woman show celebrating the women of Kuwait, and <i>A Message</i>, a comedy about religious and social tolerance; and two Shakespearean productions: <i>Othello </i>and <i>Macbeth</i>; both of which approached the broad themes of the plays from an Arab point of view.</p>
<p>This year we are producing Yussef El Guindi's <i>Jihad Jones and the Kalashnikov Babes<i> </i></i>and <i>Hamlet</i> in addition to our yearly one day New Works Festival.  El Guindi's <i>Jihad Jones</i> takes on the portrayal of Arabs in the American media with a brilliantly funny dark comedy, while our production of <i>Hamlet </i>aims to look directly at how the youth contend with the actions of the older generation as well as how to continue to function under a new, and perhaps authoritarian government.  Finally, this year's New Works Festival will feature four short plays created from Elmaz Abinader's wonderful poetry.</p>
<p>Your donation will allow us to present both an Arab story and one of Shakespeare's in the same season for the first time.  Our mission is to create a cultural bridge between the Arab world and the West and now we will be able to do this twice as quickly.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>At ASF we have always put well over 60%, sometimes upwards of 80% of our budget into paying our artists.  While we have been fiscally sound in our first four years of existence, we very much need to raise the funds to pay for as many artists as we can.  We are seeking to raise $6,500 in order to pay for the actors and stage manager for our first ever spring production.  Every single dollar that we raise will go directly to a Bay Area artist, even if we do not reach our goal we will use all of the funds to pay our artists.</p>
<p><u>The Perks!</u></p>
<p>Everyone who gives even $1 will be celebrated and rewarded!  You can check out the specifics to the right of the screen but let's highlight a few right now.  Folks giving a single dollar will be given the all important digital shout out via facebook, folks donating $50 will receive a ticket to either  <i>Hamlet</i> or <i>Jihad Jones</i>, $100 gets tickets to both shows, and for $350 you get...</p>
<p>We need a whole paragraph to explain the $350 level.   Have you ever wanted your face on a movie poster?  Now is your chance.  <i>Jihad Jones</i> illustrates and condemns the way that Arabs and Muslims are portrayed in Hollywood.  To do this we will be creating a series of movie posters on the walls of the set, which can star you!  Check out the sample above to get an idea of just what you could be the star of.  Whichever night you attend the show you will get to take it off the wall and take it home with you.  If you are unable to attend we will send you a picture of it up on the stage, and then ship it to you.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3></div><div>
<p>We are happy to say that we plan to move forward our two show season no matter what!  Every dollar that you give will go to an artist in our 2017 season!  Guaranteed!</p>
<p>Our greatest challenge moving forward will be sustaining two show seasons as we move into the coming years.  Your support will help ease this transition to many future years of multi-show seasons.</p>

<p><strong>What is GATZ?</strong></p>
<p>Gatz is a post-modern post-apocalyptic vaporwave infused interracial parody on the Great Gatsby.  I know it seems like a lot of stuff but all elements of the show share common themes that make them work.</p>
<p>There are many changes that were made to the original text that were not meant to negotiate the original themes but rather enhance the story. By providing an alternate view point one can compare the show to the original text and see elements they might have missed. That being said the work itself stands on its own as a well thought out piece that the entire family can enjoy.</p>
<p>There are a countless number of themes in The Great Gatsby as it is but Gatz touches upon areas unexplored. One of the more controversial elements of this production is Gatsby himself being played by a black man. Symbolically Gatsby has always been black and one can come to these conclusions by looking at the symbolism objectively. It would not be right if the production did this any other way and we stand by our choice.</p>
<p><strong>Who came up with this?</strong></p>
<p>Harrison Stengle is a producer/playwright/director in Philadelphia. Stengle made his directorial debut with his original work <i>Cult Classic</i> in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he received considerable media attention as part of the city’s 2015 Fringe Festival.  The following year, Stengle staged <i>Wolfhead Hamlet</i> at the Society Hill Playhouse in Philadelphia. Stengle’s adaptation of Hamlet quickly garnered him a reputation for edgy and, sometimes controversial, work.  Harrison is excited for his off-off Broadway debut of “Sword of the Unicorn” which will be in the “Theatre for a New City” Dream up Festival.  Sword of the Unicorn deconstructs false narratives about the coming out experience for the LGTBQ community, through a sci-fi fantasy twist of the Hero’s Journey. </p>
<p><strong>What is 1<sup>st</sup> Street Players?</strong></p>
<p>A small community theater nestled in the heart of Birdsboro, PA, the 1st Street Players have a huge amount of talent to display. Opening their doors in 2015,they provide top notch entertainment to the community and the surrounding areas. Their goal is to provide a safe place where children, adults and families can come and have fun, be educated and create lasting memories.  </p>
<p>Thanks to Mr.Mascaro for his unending generosity of leasing the use of this building to make a home for this theater company.  This blackbox type of theater holds 92 seats in an intimate environment and is great for many different types of show-casings.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our Mission is to provide an outlet for creative community involvement, while producing quality entertainment for the entire family. Our goals are to enrich, educate, and entertain our community by providing an exceptional and safe theater experience. We want to stimulate, enhance and celebrate the understanding of ourselves and others through the experiences of live theater, on stage, off stage, and throughout the entire process.</p>

<p><strong>What is the Philadelphia Fringe Festival?</strong></p>
<p>The Fringe Festival, presented by FringeArts, is a 17-day, city-wide celebration of innovation and creativity in contemporary performance. Each September, the Festival explodes into every nook and cranny in neighborhoods across Philadelphia with more than 1,000 artistically daring performances, including national and international performances curated by FringeArts, and works that are produced by independent artist and promoted by FringeArts. The party continues late night, every night with music, food and drink at FringeArts’ center on the Delaware River waterfront. This vast assemblage of curated and self-produced innovators offers an unparalleled opportunity to see a cross section of the world’s greatest experimenters at one time, in one city.</p>
<p><strong>Where is this going to be performed?</strong></p>
<p>This show will be performed at 2111 Samson street in the heart of Philadelphia. You may also know the theatre as the “Philadelphia Shakespeare Theatre”. There are plenty of parking garages and restraints in the area.</p>
<p><strong>How will this help?</strong></p>
<p>The hope is (or at least should be) in art is to create a higher form of communication so that we can become closer to our fellow human. This show in particular covers many controversial topics that so desperately need to be addressed. What is it like being gay and being pressured to be straight? What are the implications of being in an interracial relationship? How does our political environment shape our reality? These are questions that boggle many people. Gatz address these questions and more. By seeing events unfold in front of us we come to a higher level of understand of the people around us. The hope of this play is to end discrimination and find love.</p>
<p>We hope to hold charity events that will raise money to end inner-city violence in Philadelphia.</p>
<p><strong>What is my money going towards?</strong></p>
<p>The money you are so generously donating to this project will go into a few things. One of the major issues with this production is payment of crew. There are a lot of furniture pieces in the performance. To move these furniture pieces quickly and effectively requires a crew of at least three people. We pay everyone who wants to be involved with the project and wish only to treat people fairly. However, we are limited.</p>
<p>Our costume budget is very limited as well. Gatz requires many different high end costume pieces. We have a basic budget laid out but to get the quality we are looking for it would require some more funds.</p>
<p>When the theatre group tragically left the space, we occupy now, they took all the lighting equipment with them. To perform in this space, we will need to rent all the technical equipment, that are typically the standard in other theatres. This can be very costly and the fear is that we will not have enough money to satisfy the shows lighting needs.</p>
<p><strong>Is there any other way I can help?</strong></p>
<p>Why sure you can. We are always looking for and excepting volunteers to help with seating or be in our crew. If you would like to be a part of this production please contact Harrison Stengle at his email <a href=""mailto:hstengle@aol.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">hstengle@aol.com</a>.</p>

To perform in this space, we will need to rent all the technical equipment, that are typically the standard in other theatres. This can be very costly and the fear is that we will not have enough money to satisfy the shows lighting needs.
Is there any other way I can help?
Why sure you can. We are always looking for and excepting volunteers to help with seating or be in our crew. If you would like to be a part of this production please contact Harrison Stengle at his email hstengle@aol.com.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>About ""In Manhattan""</h3>
<p><strong>IN MANHATTAN</strong> is a socially relevant play that looks at the lives of a young couple that come to New York City with big city dreams, but end up far from where they expected to be. It's a story of hopes, dreams, and the realities that sometimes take us off course and force us to make life saving decisions that may not be too pretty, but are the only option. On the fringe, are many such people living all around us.  For <strong>Rick Charles Mueller</strong>, as a playwright, it is important to tell these stories because they are real or based on real issues. IN MANHATTAN explores the lives of a young couple and the disappointments and challenges they face after arriving in New York City with dreams to become actors. They get scammed, and with no option, end up homeless and without money. It's a tale about being young and on top of the world, finding their saddest, lowest point, and with the help of a stranger, eventually finding their way. It is also a story about parenting, about sexual awakening and discovery, and the obstacles that either bind us, or frees us.  </p>
<p>Rick Charles Mueller is an activist who speaks internationally about social issues and the importance of acceptance and understanding. He is also a novelist, playwright, and actor who has written about many of the issues we face in our world, especially issues so concentrated in a big metropolis like New York City.</p>
<p>As a playwright, he writes about injustices and brings some of the dark things he has encountered to the stage. As president of his non-profit organization, Pride Not Prejudice, Inc., he finds ways to bring his message to the forefront and initiate dialogue, discussion and solutions. With his work as a playwright, he does the same. IN MANHATTAN is a work that delves into issues such as homelessness, drug addition, parenting, sexuality, puberty, and even Tourette's Syndrome. His characters are memorable and you will want to continue the dialogue beyond your time at the theater.</p>
<p>This campaign is the first attempt for Mr. Mueller to take his work beyond the theatre festival circuit, and bring his story to a broader audience. As a playwright, he has produced, directed, and acted in many of his plays, all with social issues worth discussing and viewing. But with IN MANHATTAN, Mr. Mueller makes his first attempt at bringing his message of hope and understanding to the general public.</p>
<p>During these tumultuous times, when our political and social differences are causing a divide, especially in a city like New York, Mr. Mueller hopes to create a general dialogue that brings us closer and not further apart. It promises to be an important journey that can make an impact, even if to only a small section of the local population.</p>
<p>Without the support of contributors, sponsors, and even other social activists (or socially conscious supporters), we can't tell this story and promote it widely.  Even the smallest contribution will help!</p>
<p>With your contribution, we can create a play production that incorporates an inspiring, tight script, a talented professional group of actors, and the highest quality production values we can bring to the stage. With this kind of core value, we can then focus on promoting the play, not because of some commercial endeavor, but because the message matters, and many people should be exposed to it. At this point, we have already secured the opportunity to be covered by some media outlets largely in part due to contributions of some initial supporters. With this non-profit project, your tax-deductible contribution will be the final step in bringing In Manhattan to the New York stage.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>We need you. Here's how. </h3>
<p>There is no doing this without you.</p>
<ul>
<li>We need approximately $24K+ to mount a full production of IN MANHATTAN. We want to do this in New York City (uh, actually ""in Manhattan"") and run for three full weekends, including matinees and evening performances including Wednesday and Thursdays. More importantly, we plan to offer tickets to folks who otherwise wouldn't be able to afford theatre, and get groups of the disenfranchised into some special performances. We also want to appeal to the general public and create some buzz and notice within larger groups.</li>
<li>We are asking for your support so that we can not only mount this production, but also create attention to some of the most needy in our society. Our production will incorporate a fundraising element that we hope will be visible outside the show itself so that we can encourage people to donate to causes that help fight homelessness, drug additions, disorder such as Tourette’s Syndrome and more! Your contribution will help us focus attention on some of the non-profits out there that help these people so that we can create interest and support for these groups. IT WILL GO FAR BEYOND these performances!</li>
<li>Contributors will be thanked in many different ways. Depending on what level of contribution you make (again, all tax-deductible), you will receive free tickets to the show, mentions in our program, invites to a very special opening party, and the opportunity to meet people just like you that CARE!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Mr. Mueller has been working for many years to take his message to young audiences throughout the NYC Board of Ed system in an effort to inspire tomorrow's future to be more compassionate and understanding of other people's situations. His success is that he and his Pride Not Prejudice non-profit organization has been invited back to these schools for years. His involvement in gay rights and other issues that matter, has resulted in life altering situations where young people have shared how he has changed their lives and their perception of life. He wants to bring this message to a larger audience, gain more visibility for his cause, and inspire thousands more to advocate positive change and a stronger charitable philosophy. He asks that if you help him, he can help thousands more, an inspire his audiences to do the same! Your contribution is life-altering. It's for the sake of art... that matters.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our hurdle is money. Mr. Mueller has already invested thousands in getting this play to the stage, has enlisted the help of many who can contribute with marketing, PR, promotion, advertising, and even the work required to logistically plan this journey to the larger stage. Without your contributions, we can't stage this play in a manner that will gain the visibility it needs. </p>
<p>Any contribution you can make will be instrumental in helping us finish what we started. We have the script, are planning another reading, and are looking to enlist the help of professionals who will make the vision come to life! Without you, we can't achieve this greater mission. Please help.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Many Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>A contribution is phenomenal. Any contribution. But we only have 60 days to raise the monies needed to find the right venue, hire the cast, begin production on sets, marketing, lighting, sound, costumes, and so much more. We are looking for many ways to achieve this and are working round the clock to accomplish our goals. But there are so many other ways you can help.</p>
<ul>
<li>Help us spread the word. Share our videos, our links, our social media posts! Subscribe to our site and share what updates we share with you so that we can kick this off in a big way!</li>
<li>Know of any interested sponsors? Businesses? Or organizations that can help? Please let us know by emailing InManhattanThePlay@Gmail.com. Donations, if not in dollars, are welcomed in-kind. A free theatre venue, volunteers, all those things matter!</li>

<p>On Aug 8th at Lyric Hyperion Theatre in Los Angeles, internationally touring theater artist, music artist, and activist Sariyah Idan will perform HOMELESS IN HOMELAND to be filmed in front of a live audience. (RSVP on <a href=""https://homelessinhomeland_lyric.eventbrite.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Eventbrite</a>.) This filming will both open doors and make it eternal, at least digitally. This campaign is to cover the costs of the space rental and filming.</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501269315/zw9ppr3gi1g82ilikfe9.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Through its development process, this acclaimed interdisciplinary theater show has been presented at festivals and colleges in California, New York, Massachusetts, Maryland and England UK. Now, with a brand new prologue that ties the central themes of the show to more universal questions about identity, migration and diaspora, it is time to properly document HOMELESS IN HOMELAND.  Donors to this Indiegogo campaign will receive access to the final edited video.</p>
<p>The high-quality, three-camera shoot and edit facilitated by Hal Masonberg of Off Leash Films will accomplish three important goals.</p>
<ul>
<li>It will provide new images and clips for promotional and booking material.</li>
<li>It will enable people who cannot attend a live performance (due to location, etc.) to see it on video.</li>
<li>It will archive the show so that there is a solid record of it after it is no longer being performed. Sariyah is extremely proud of this piece, and of all the work that collaborating artists have put in, namely Shymala Moorty and Troy Acendor. It is important that this material can live on.</li>
</ul>
<p>The $1200 will go towards the theater rental, tech, and camera gear. Breakdown of the budget below. Any additional funds raised will go towards stipends for the generous work of cinematographer and editor Hal Masonberg, director Shyamala Moorty, and writer/performer Sariyah Idan.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u>SHOW DESCRIPTION:</u><br/>What and where is home? Combining poetry, dance, and character monologue, Sariyah Idan conveys a young Jewish-American woman’s struggle to understand her identity, her family and relationships, justice, and the meaning of home through the lens of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Idan’s portrayal of seventeen vibrant and diverse Americans, Palestinians, and Israelis, uncovers a new Middle East of grief, daily struggle, and humor. HOMELESS IN HOMELAND is a solo show in a documentary hip-hop theatre aesthetic, based on a trip taken by the writer-performer to the State of Israel and the occupied West Bank. “a dramatic tour-de-force…not to be missed (Hollywood Progressive).” The play briefly touches on Idan’s studies of Islam and her birth on a Sufi commune in New York.</p>
<p>“…A stunning piece of theater. Highly recommended.”</p>
<p>— Gail Louw, Brighton Fringe Review, England, 2013                                              <a href=""http://fringereview.co.uk/review/brighton-fringe/2013/homeless-in-homeland/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://fringereview.co.uk/review/brighton-fring...</a></p>

<p> </p>
<p>HOMELESS IN HOMELAND was born from Sariyah’s commitment to the intersection of multiple narratives through a lens of compassion, her investigation of the responsibility that comes with privilege, and her belief that interdisciplinary performance has the capacity to create transformational experiences. During the writing process Ms Idan spent time in Israel and the occupied West Bank meeting and working with various different groups, both coexistence and direct action organizations.</p>
<p>“Idan boldly, but never recklessly, confronts these simmering issues with sensitivity, intelligence and an over-abundance of talent in this solo show.”<br/>— Ed Rampell, The Forward, 2014  <a href=""http://forward.com/schmooze/192168/finding-homeland-at-la-women-s-theatre-fes/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://forward.com/schmooze/192168/finding-home...</a></p>

</div></div>","On Aug 8th at Lyric Hyperion Theatre in Los Angeles, internationally touring theater artist, music artist, and activist Sariyah Idan will perform HOMELESS IN HOMELAND to be filmed in front of a live audience. (RSVP on Eventbrite.) This filming will both open doors and make it eternal, at least digitally. This campaign is to cover the costs of the space rental and filming.

Through its development process, this acclaimed interdisciplinary theater show has been presented at festivals and colleges in California, New York, Massachusetts, Maryland and England UK. Now, with a brand new prologue that ties the central themes of the show to more universal questions about identity, migration and diaspora, it is time to properly document HOMELESS IN HOMELAND.  Donors to this Indiegogo campaign will receive access to the final edited video.
The high-quality, three-camera shoot and edit facilitated by Hal Masonberg of Off Leash Films will accomplish three important goals.

It will provide new images and clips for promotional and booking material.
It will enable people who cannot attend a live performance (due to location, etc.) to see it on video.
It will archive the show so that there is a solid record of it after it is no longer being performed. Sariyah is extremely proud of this piece, and of all the work that collaborating artists have put in, namely Shymala Moorty and Troy Acendor. It is important that this material can live on.

The $1200 will go towards the theater rental, tech, and camera gear. Breakdown of the budget below. Any additional funds raised will go towards stipends for the generous work of cinematographer and editor Hal Masonberg, director Shyamala Moorty, and writer/performer Sariyah Idan.
 
SHOW DESCRIPTION:What and where is home? Combining poetry, dance, and character monologue, Sariyah Idan conveys a young Jewish-American woman’s struggle to understand her identity, her family and relationships, justice, and the meaning of home through the lens of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Idan’s portrayal of seventeen vibrant and diverse Americans, Palestinians, and Israelis, uncovers a new Middle East of grief, daily struggle, and humor. HOMELESS IN HOMELAND is a solo show in a documentary hip-hop theatre aesthetic, based on a trip taken by the writer-performer to the State of Israel and the occupied West Bank. “a dramatic tour-de-force…not to be missed (Hollywood Progressive).” The play briefly touches on Idan’s studies of Islam and her birth on a Sufi commune in New York.
“…A stunning piece of theater. Highly recommended.”
— Gail Louw, Brighton Fringe Review, England, 2013                                              http://fringereview.co.uk/review/brighton-fring...

 
HOMELESS IN HOMELAND was born from Sariyah’s commitment to the intersection of multiple narratives through a lens of compassion, her investigation of the responsibility that comes with privilege, and her belief that interdisciplinary performance has the capacity to create transformational experiences. During the writing process Ms Idan spent time in Israel and the occupied West Bank meeting and working with various different groups, both coexistence and direct action organizations.
“Idan boldly, but never recklessly, confronts these simmering issues with sensitivity, intelligence and an over-abundance of talent in this solo show.”— Ed Rampell, The Forward, 2014  http://forward.com/schmooze/192168/finding-home...

<p>     After the acclaimed premiere (on April 3rd and 4th of 2017) that got 60 young Armenians involved and passionate about performing on stage, Andrea , with the support of the new Artistic Director, Constantine Orbelian, has been asked to launch a production of a Broadway musical at the Armenian National Academic Theater of Opera and Ballet in Yerevan.  Unfortunately, the Opera's budget is limited and they cannot afford the performance rights, rentals and royalties themselves. With your help we can get this project to materialise - we need 9,000 Euros to finance the rights and rentals for On The Town by Leonard Bernstein, which is Andrea’s first choice, not least because 2018 is Leonard Bernstein's 100th birthday!</p>
<p>      If we don’t reach our goal of €9,000 for this production we would use what we have collected to hold workshops in Musical Theater Arts in Yerevan, which are sorely needed.

<p>    Andrea has almost 40 years’ experience as a teacher of singing and acting; she has already directed ""On The Town"" as well as dozens of other musicals, operas and plays, and she can get incredible performances out of total beginners (you can see what they can do by clicking on the link to ""The Illuminator"" above and viewing a video of the complete premiere performance).

<p>If we are unable to reach our funding goal, both Creative Place and Artistic New Directions are committed to bringing this production to audiences with our February off-broadway dates and the show will go on!  All funds received for this campaign will go to producing <i>Kunstler</i>.  Should we receive more than our goal (a delicious thought!) any funds not used for this specific production will be used to extend or move this run or help send it on tour for others in the country to experience.</p>

Kunstler was written specifically for Broadway veteran Jeff McCarthy (who received terrific reviews last season as one of the leads in Southern Comfort at the Public Theater and was one of the original stars of the Tony-winning Urinetown).  Jeff is joined by Nambi E. Kelley, a leading Chicago actor-writer (she recently received raves both as the star of the Goodman’s production of Two Trains Running and for her hit adaptation of Richard Wright’s Native Son).
The director is Meagen Fay, one of the most highly-regarded alums of Chicago’s famed Second City troupe and a guest star on almost every TV show worth your time (including Mad Men and Transparent).  Kunstler was a family friend (she called him “Uncle Bill”) who collaborated with her lawyer uncle on some of his most controversial cases.  (In fact, Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin crashed in the family house during the Chicago 7 trial and she had waffles with them in the morning.)
The Creative Place International, Inc. in association with Artistic New Directions, two non-profit theatre companies  (donations are tax-deductible) have joined forces to bring this compelling play to an off-Broadway audience.  
The Creative Place International,Inc. is a Small Professional Equity Theatre based in Saratoga Springs, New York and resident at the National Museum of Dance. The Creative Place is dedicated to developing family audiences, producing new work, and participating in international cultural exchange.  For over 30 years, New York City based Artistic New Directions through its development program has provided a place for playwrights to create work through their choice of
readings, workshops and improvisational exploration and has provided initial development support for Kunstler.
Kunstler has been presented twice before, once in Regional Theatre (Hudson Stage), where it was praised by the New York Times as “skillful, wise and revealing,” then as part of the New York Fringe, where Time Out dubbed it a “critic’s choice.”  (Among its fans were Mike Nichols, Sheldon Harnick, Marshall W. Mason and Tonya Pinkins, who shlepped up the stairs to a garret to see it.)  This production will continue Kunstler’s journey from Regional Theatre to Fringe Festival, Off Broadway and beyond, bringing this “gripping” (New York Theatre Review) work to a wider audience and launching it into the national repertoire so the true story of a remarkable and complex man can be shared around the country and the world!   
What We Need & What You Get
 On our own, we have received more than half the funding we need to bring this play to the high-profile 59E59 Theatre in New York City.  We have dates booked for February 2017 but we need to complete our funding before September to ensure all costs are covered.  We have previously fully funded this play with a modest budget for the New York Fringe Festival, a bare-bones situation that served the play in a small black box theatre at the end of three long flights of stairs.  With minimal set pieces and creative lighting and sound, that presentation was a sell-out success.  With this production, we will be designing all-new sets, lights and sound, as well as paying the designers, actors and director (novelty!).   
If we are unable to reach our funding goal, both Creative Place and Artistic New Directions are committed to bringing this production to audiences with our February off-broadway dates and the show will go on!  All funds received for this campaign will go to producing Kunstler.  Should we receive more than our goal (a delicious thought!) any funds not used for this specific production will be used to extend or move this run or help send it on tour for others in the country to experience.",0.0,0,"11 Campaigns

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""> <h3></h3><p>We are bringing a reimagined Globe Theatre to the Playa and filling it with people witnessing one another speak with joy, passion, abandon, specificity, imagination, irreverence, humor and pathos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Burning Globe fully embraces the mission to change the paradigm of art from a commodified object to an interactive, participatory, shared experience of creative expression. As a piece of live theatre,  our work can only exist once in time and it is gone. Our gift will be a series of workshops, on site performances and around Playa performance journeys that are created by the players and audience; our company will only facilitate. We will bring Shakespeare’s language to a community of 60,000 people whose previous experience may be a play a teacher presented to them as literature, made them read rather than speak and then told them what it should mean to them. We do not believe there is a right way to speak Shakespeare; just the way that brings the words, speaker and audience to life.  It is a world in which the player gets to encounter who they are and who they might be.  Everything they need is within themselves and as they breathe their life into the text it comes alive as if for the first time. This heightened language is for everyone as it holds the sacred and the profane, the ridiculous and sublime. It asks big questions about the human experience in all its complexity and invites the speaker to commit body, voice, heart, and soul to the moment.  And it is enormously fun.  I often tell people that speaking Shakespeare from an authentic, passionate place is like getting to be Mick Jagger live in concert. To get up on a stage and say to a group of friends and strangers under a wide desert sky, ""We are such stuff as dreams are made of and our little life is rounded with a sleep "" transforms you and all those listening. It is my hope that people leave the Playa having had that experience and then allow it to have ripples in their lives and to deepen their appreciation of and hunger for live theatre.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the lead artist on this project, I bring over twenty years of experience directing, teaching, coaching and performing Shakespeare. As an actor, I have performed with numerous professional theaters and Shakespeare festivals around the country. I am currently the Co Head of Voice and Dialects at the American Conservatory Theatre where I train actors in the MFA program as well as coach the mainstage productions. I am also on the faculty at UC Berkeley and have previously been on faculty at UC Davis, Syracuse University, and Shakespeare and Company. I have directed everything from full Shakespeare productions to rogue touring adaptations. I have coached over seventy professional productions and am a certified Linklater voice teacher who works with people of all ages and professions to free their voices and find more authentic, clear and effective ways of communicating. I know how to take something from nothing, to meet all obstacles head on,  to adapt as necessary and to make the experience fun and fulfilling for all involved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This year, your contribution will allow us to build three performance/workshop spaces- a  20 foot dome space, a 10 x 12 x 2 stage and an 8 x 8 x10 balcony space, as well as a Shakespeare Tarot booth/bar. It will allow us to purchase swords, costumes, instruments,and a sound system that will also need to be transported to the Playa. It will allow us to document our work. This year is just the beginning. All leftover funds from this year will go toward our continuing goal of creating a fully realized Globe Theatre that is a work of art for all to enjoy in the middle of the Playa.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In return for your help, we have created a few fun perks of personalized Shakespeare recordings, Shakespeare Tarot cards and private vocal coaching sessions. If you are in the Bay Area, anyone who contributes will be invited to the pre event and post event thank you Gumbo celebrations. So give whatever you can and please pass the word to everyone you know.

The Burning Globe fully embraces the mission to change the paradigm of art from a commodified object to an interactive, participatory, shared experience of creative expression. As a piece of live theatre,  our work can only exist once in time and it is gone. Our gift will be a series of workshops, on site performances and around Playa performance journeys that are created by the players and audience; our company will only facilitate. We will bring Shakespeare’s language to a community of 60,000 people whose previous experience may be a play a teacher presented to them as literature, made them read rather than speak and then told them what it should mean to them. We do not believe there is a right way to speak Shakespeare; just the way that brings the words, speaker and audience to life.  It is a world in which the player gets to encounter who they are and who they might be.  Everything they need is within themselves and as they breathe their life into the text it comes alive as if for the first time. This heightened language is for everyone as it holds the sacred and the profane, the ridiculous and sublime. It asks big questions about the human experience in all its complexity and invites the speaker to commit body, voice, heart, and soul to the moment.  And it is enormously fun.  I often tell people that speaking Shakespeare from an authentic, passionate place is like getting to be Mick Jagger live in concert. To get up on a stage and say to a group of friends and strangers under a wide desert sky, ""We are such stuff as dreams are made of and our little life is rounded with a sleep "" transforms you and all those listening. It is my hope that people leave the Playa having had that experience and then allow it to have ripples in their lives and to deepen their appreciation of and hunger for live theatre.

As the lead artist on this project, I bring over twenty years of experience directing, teaching, coaching and performing Shakespeare. As an actor, I have performed with numerous professional theaters and Shakespeare festivals around the country. I am currently the Co Head of Voice and Dialects at the American Conservatory Theatre where I train actors in the MFA program as well as coach the mainstage productions. I am also on the faculty at UC Berkeley and have previously been on faculty at UC Davis, Syracuse University, and Shakespeare and Company. I have directed everything from full Shakespeare productions to rogue touring adaptations. I have coached over seventy professional productions and am a certified Linklater voice teacher who works with people of all ages and professions to free their voices and find more authentic, clear and effective ways of communicating. I know how to take something from nothing, to meet all obstacles head on,  to adapt as necessary and to make the experience fun and fulfilling for all involved.


This year, your contribution will allow us to build three performance/workshop spaces- a  20 foot dome space, a 10 x 12 x 2 stage and an 8 x 8 x10 balcony space, as well as a Shakespeare Tarot booth/bar. It will allow us to purchase swords, costumes, instruments,and a sound system that will also need to be transported to the Playa. It will allow us to document our work. This year is just the beginning. All leftover funds from this year will go toward our continuing goal of creating a fully realized Globe Theatre that is a work of art for all to enjoy in the middle of the Playa.

In return for your help, we have created a few fun perks of personalized Shakespeare recordings, Shakespeare Tarot cards and private vocal coaching sessions. If you are in the Bay Area, anyone who contributes will be invited to the pre event and post event thank you Gumbo celebrations. So give whatever you can and please pass the word to everyone you know. And if you are at the event, come find us at 5:45 and High Renaissance and join in.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>About The Play</h3>
<p>Jane doesn’t know what to do with the literary character who has taken up residence in her bathtub. She doesn’t want Ophelia interrupting the obsessive order of her life with obnoxious songs about death and valentines. She doesn’t want Ophelia disrupting her relationship with Edmund, the oddly charming actor who might show up for dinner in a suit...of armor. And she most definitely doesn’t want Ophelia stirring up memories of a brother she would rather forget. But Ophelia doesn’t care about what Jane wants so much as what she needs. As Jane’s past intrudes dangerously on her present, it becomes clear that Ophelia is not simply a character from Hamlet, but a long-forgotten messenger with a question from Jane’s own troubled mind: How do you move on when reconciliation is not an option?</p>
<ul>
<li>This timely, poetic play tackles many different issues facing the younger generations today including abuse, mental illness, suicide, and victim self-blame, without pandering or preaching to the audience. It's hard to come by plays with such a beautiful and difficult message of understanding and forgiveness, without victimizing or villainizing any character or party.</li>
<li><p>We live in a time where boundaries are being redefined: what constitutes rape? Who bears the responsibility of suicide? What is and is not okay to joke about? And in the course of these discussions and drawing of boundary lines, we often see everything in black and white, bad and good, evil and pure. We forget that even those we villainize are human. We, as a society enveloped in technology, have found a way to dehumanize those we find unworthy based on their actions. No matter how much we believe we have progressed as a species, we still find ways to carry on behavior we thought we eradicated hundreds of years ago; we’ve just done it from a longer distance, through a computer screen. This play has found a way to empathize with someone we thought we could never empathize with. Rachel Strayer has blurred our defined boundaries, and mixed the black with the white. In a time where we think everything is clear cut, Ms. Strayer makes us re-think judgment, and re-evaluate our standing as humans.</p></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why Now? Why This Show?</h3>
<ul><li><p>Never has there been a more important time to break down the technological armor that allows us to cyber bully, judge from a distance, say things we would never say in person, and more importantly, shield us from empathy. When one is faced with empathizing with someone thought to be “pure evil” based on their actions, we are completely uprooted, and have the opportunity to look at others we may have judged.</p></li></ul>

<p>Each year, hundreds of dancers, choreographers, educators, students, and audience members come through our doors and fill the Performance Garage with movement, creativity, and love of the arts. </p>
<p>The studios at the Performance Garage are one-of-a kind in Philadelphia's dance community.  We offer <span style=""background-color: initial;"">two spacious studios with sprung Marley floors, technical support for performances, as well as dressing rooms and other amenities.  Our performance space has a professional lighting and sound system with seating for 120 audience members.  Our rehearsal/class space has wall-to-wall mirrors, dance barres, and a reception area.  </span></p>

<h3>What a New Floor Can Do</h3>
<h3></h3>
</div>
<p>In order to continue serving our
community of dancers and expand our reach, the Performance Garage is raising
funds to replace the floor in Studio B.  For
over 13 years, the Performance Garage's professional grade studios have been
utilized by countless renters for rehearsals, productions, auditions, classes,
workshops, and our Youth Outreach Program.  With all those feet twirling, jumping, leaping, stomping, and shuffling around, it's no surprise that our studio
floors have become worn and are in desperate need of replacement.
 Additionally, the current flooring does not accommodate all shoes types
and limits the styles of dance that can utilize the space to those with bare
feet, cloth or leather dance shoes, and pointe shoes.  </p><p><br/></p><div>
<b>The new floor </b>we have selected will allow for more styles of dance be hosted at the Performance Garage including Tap, Flamenco, Hip Hop, and more!  It also is a great surface for dancing in bare feet, ballet and point shoes, and sneakers- a true miracle floor!<span style=""background-color: initial;""> We will be purchasing the floor from a local company called Stage Step, who for over 40 years has been providing innovative flooring solutions specifically for dance, theater, and performing arts spaces.</span>
</div><div> <h3>Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>Your contribution will help the Performance Garage to further its mission and increase our sustainability.  This new floor will help us expand our roster of classes, serve more types of dance companies, and develop new audiences.</p>

</div></div>","A Home for Dance 
Each year, hundreds of dancers, choreographers, educators, students, and audience members come through our doors and fill the Performance Garage with movement, creativity, and love of the arts. 
The studios at the Performance Garage are one-of-a kind in Philadelphia's dance community.  We offer two spacious studios with sprung Marley floors, technical support for performances, as well as dressing rooms and other amenities.  Our performance space has a professional lighting and sound system with seating for 120 audience members.  Our rehearsal/class space has wall-to-wall mirrors, dance barres, and a reception area.  


    
What a New Floor Can Do


In order to continue serving our
community of dancers and expand our reach, the Performance Garage is raising
funds to replace the floor in Studio B.  For
over 13 years, the Performance Garage's professional grade studios have been
utilized by countless renters for rehearsals, productions, auditions, classes,
workshops, and our Youth Outreach Program.  With all those feet twirling, jumping, leaping, stomping, and shuffling around, it's no surprise that our studio
floors have become worn and are in desperate need of replacement.
 Additionally, the current flooring does not accommodate all shoes types
and limits the styles of dance that can utilize the space to those with bare
feet, cloth or leather dance shoes, and pointe shoes.  
The new floor we have selected will allow for more styles of dance be hosted at the Performance Garage including Tap, Flamenco, Hip Hop, and more!  It also is a great surface for dancing in bare feet, ballet and point shoes, and sneakers- a true miracle floor! We will be purchasing the floor from a local company called Stage Step, who for over 40 years has been providing innovative flooring solutions specifically for dance, theater, and performing arts spaces.
 Impact 
Your contribution will help the Performance Garage to further its mission and increase our sustainability.  This new floor will help us expand our roster of classes, serve more types of dance companies, and develop new audiences.
Thus far in our 2014-2015 season, we have hosted and provided support to:




52 production
rentals with 771 participating artists


71 performances
with over 5,000 audience members


28 dance
workshops with 380 attendees


75 studio rentals for
classes, auditions, and rehearsals


25 weeks of
free outreach classes for underserved youth





The new floor will increase the impact we will have our our dance community and allow us to expand our constituency.  Please donate today to help us get a new floor and be floored by the results!


Every Little Bit Makes a DifferenceThe Performance Garage Give 'n' Get Floored campaign is aimed at donors of all levels! Your contribution, in any amount, represents a show of support for the many dancers and choreographers who rely on the Performance Garage as a home for their artistic work. The individual support from donors like you helps our organization flourish with a sense of community and personal connection.

</div><p><b>What is Eastside Heartbeats?</b></p><div>
<div><span>""Eastside Heartbeats"" uses an actual event, Cannibal and the Headhunters opening for the Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl in 1965, to tell the largely fictional story of a young man's dreams and the vibrant East LA music scene of the 1960s. The full-length, rock and roll musical features a book by Tom Waldman, co-author with David Reyes of ""Land of a Thousand Dances: Chicano Rock and Roll from Southern California."" The music is composed by hit 60's songwriter, James Holvay, best known for writing the hits for The Buckinghams (""Kind Of A Drag,"" ""Don't You Care"" etc.), Rudy Salas, a founding member of Tierra, known for their hit song, ""Together,"" and the composer David Reyes. Waldman and Nancy Bianconi (producer of three Off Broadway musicals) are co-producers of the show, which is being presented by Casa 0101. The director is Corky Dominguez, who directed ""Real Women Have Curves"" which premiered at Casa 0101 Theatre. <p></p></span></div>

""For God so greatly loved and dearly prized the world that He [even] gave up His only begotten (unique) Son, so that whoever believes in (trusts in, clings to, relies on) Him shall not perish (come to destruction, be lost) but have eternal (everlasting) life."" -John 3:16 (AMP)

<h3>Innovation Dance</h3>
<div>Innovation Dance Studios was founded five years ago by Emma Hardy and Zoe Newell, and it now provides classes to children and adults from studios in Ealing, Finchley and Colindale, plus over fifty weekly outreach classes based in schools and community centres.</div>
<div>The Ealing studio in Pitshanger Lane is currently full to capacity, with classes being provided in hired halls in addition to the main studio, and some children still on waiting lists. Due to space availability, the hired venues are in different parts of Ealing, and not always convenient for parents and children.</div>
<div>We have the opportunity to have a second full-time studio on the same road as our existing one, but this would need building from scratch. </div>

<p>The cost of leasing the building and building the studio from scratch is £150,000. We can provide the majority of the funding but are looking for the final £15,000 for the finishing touches to make the dancers have the right sound equipment, A/C, flooring and and teaching tools.</p>
<p>Its sounds like a huge amount, but building a creative space is pretty expensive. Some of the costs are:</p>

<ul></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>The new studio will allow hundreds more children to attend class in a professional environment. It would mean we can take classes out of church halls, which don't have specialist flooring, air conditioning and mirrors, and into a proper studio environment. </div>
<div>It would also allow us to open a new range of classes, including break dance, contemporary and GCSE Dance, which we currently can't fit into our existing studio space, giving a much broader range of opportunities for the local children. </div>
<div>We will also be able to provide more adult classes, covering different dance styles which are currently frequently requested, such as ballroom, salsa and jazz.</div>
<div>Our current Ealing studio is a great community space for adults and children to come together and learn - children have the opportunity to perform in annual theatre productions and at local community events, and to enter examinations to gain valuable qualifications. The studio has a lovely family environment, and we would like to re-create the same fun, friendly feel just down the road!</div>

Cabaret! Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and (hopefully)
supporting this wonderful show!

</p><h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
<p>Cabaret is set in a
glamourous yet seedy nightclub in 1930s Germany as the Nazi party begins its
rise to power. Acting as an allegory about the way people become bystanders and
ignore the evil going on around them, the show explores how quickly, and with
such little resistance, Berlin became unsafe for the Jewish and homosexual
communities. This is represented by the struggle of many of the performers and
guests at the fictional Kit Kat Klub within the show.<br/>
<br/>
We see this show
as a perfect way to mark and reflect on a monumental anniversary and act as a
clear call to action in the present; focusing on the contemporary relevance of
the Holocaust and subsequent genocides, and considering our individual
responsibilities not to be bystanders to hate crime and prejudice.<br/>
<br/>
Our vision for Cabaret
is to create an immersive piece of theatre that defies convention and will blur the lines between performance and
spectator. We hope to give the audience an experience that feels more like they
are entering a real life cabaret in 1930’s Germany, rather than an evening at
the theatre. This will be the first time we
have attempted
a production on this scale in our 50 year history.</p>
<h3><b>What You Get</b></h3><p><span><span>We have a range of perks on offer for supporters,

<p><i><b>From the
moment audience members pass through the front doors of the building, they will
be immediately transported into the world of 1930’s Berlin and the Kit Kat
Klub. </b></i><b><br/>To commemorate Holocaust Memorial
Day in 2016 ACT Aberdeen are producing a unique event, of which Cabaret, the
musical, will be the centrepiece. Based on John Van Druten's play ‘I Am a
Camera’, adapted from Christopher Isherwood’s short novel ‘Goodbye to Berlin’,
‘Cabaret’ is set in early 1930s Berlin as the Nazis are rising to power. The
seedy Kit Kat Club is at the centre of the action, and features 19-year-old
English cabaret performer Sally Bowles and her relationship with young American
writer Cliff Bradshaw.<br/>
<br/>
A sub-plot involves a doomed romance between German boarding house owner
Fräulein Schneider and a Jewish fruit vendor Herr Schultz. The Master of
Ceremonies at the Kit Kat Klub oversees the action, and the club serves as a
metaphor for ominous political developments in late Weimar Germany.<br/>
<br/>The venue will be transformed to look like a
nightclub with a 1930s style burlesque and entertainment during the interval,
and before and after the performance. To counterpoint the lighter
entertainment of the musical and burlesque offerings, our exhibitions spaces will
host an experiential journey of life in the concentration camps, giving
participants a vivid impression of the suffering of those who perished in the
Nazi gas chambers. The exhibition will take people on a journey from the Nazi
holocaust through the fifteen confirmed acts of mass genocide since the end of
World War Two, drawing attention to the fact that, to this day, acts of mass
murder by states are still continuing, despite a United Nations vow, in 1945,
that they must never occur again.

<p>The seminal BBC Radio classic comedy, spawning <b>The Goodies</b> and <b>Monty Python's Flying Circus</b> and, most importantly, the forerunner to <b>I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue</b>, has been somewhat neglected in the pantheon of '60s and '70s radio comedy goodness.

</div> </div>","I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again... AGAIN!


The seminal BBC Radio classic comedy, spawning The Goodies and Monty Python's Flying Circus and, most importantly, the forerunner to I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue, has been somewhat neglected in the pantheon of '60s and '70s radio comedy goodness. We aim to put this right, with YOUR help! Starring John Cleese, Graeme Garden, Bill Oddie, Tim Brooke-Taylor, David Hatch and Jo Kendall, this mix of anarchic madness, silly puns, catchphrases galore and gloriously manic characters ran from 1964 to 1973 and had a youth following that made live recordings seem more like a rock concert than a comedy show. It was immediate and fresh and energetic.
By crowdfunding our production, we aim to bring a 'Best Of' package together in one LIVE theatre show in February next year. All we're asking from you is to help raise our production budget, in order to adapt, rehearse and stage this unique show. We'll be donating all the profits to the charities put forward by writers Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie.


We are The OFFSTAGE Theatre Group and have been running from our base in Gloucestershire since 1991. We've won the odd award, toured the 'classics' and premiered a lot of original work, all of which have been highly-acclaimed. We pride ourselves on having a close-knit team of creatives that we call on when we have a special project to do, such as this. Our version of this classic comedy will feature a new team of comic actors who won't be doing slavish impersonations but 'archetypes' of the roles inhabited by the original cast. It's the buzzing of energy and barrage of jokes that we aim to astound the audience with.
We're very humbled to have been granted exclusive rights for this one-off show by ISIRTA's original writers, Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie. We're also very excited to be working alongside the legend that is Dirk Maggs (multi-talented writer/director/producer/musician/bearded wonder), who will be adapting, directing and producing alongside our very own walking chinbeard, Barnaby Eaton-Jones; as well as Andrew Farrington as Musical Director and Band Leader.The charities that Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie have chosen to benefit from this one-off production are ENRYCH and The League Against Cruel Sports.Our budget might seem like a lot for a one-off production but here's a little run-down of what this professional production has to pay for...
Cost of Venue Hire; Performance (The Bacon Theatre, Cheltenham)
Cost of Venue Hire; Technical Rehearsal (The Bacon Theatre, Cheltenham)

Cost of Adapting The Script (from 9 series and one 25th anniversary special)

Cost of Rehearsal Space (musical and staging separately and then together)

Cost of Professional Musicians (a 5-Piece Band)

Cost of Professional Actors (5, in total)

Cost of Graphic Designer/Artist (posters and artwork)

Cost of Set Building (construction and materials)

Cost of Copyright Percentage (allowing us to perform this work)


Cost of Costumes (actors and musicians)


Cost of Live Foley (sound effects props and technician)

Cost of extra Sound Equipment for venue (mics, etc)

Cost of Public Liability Insurance (one-off, as requested by the venue)

Cost of Publicity (posters, flyers, programmes, etc)

Cost of Producer/Director fees

“I fully support WELL
SEASONED PRODUCTIONS. I have been performing onstage for over 50 years now and
I truly believe I am just getting the hang of it! The idea of a platform for
all of us to keep doing what we love and entertaining audiences is a stunning
idea. I hope I can play a role in this fabulous idea. We may be getting a
little older but that just means we are getting better.” 

Sheila Mccarthy, Performer

“I am pleased to be
able to work with five truly well seasoned professional performers. Their
dedication, experience and enthusiasm take them far along their new and
exciting path. We all look forward to their opening night!”

Dr. Joseph Green, Professor Emeritus, York University, and
Mentor for Well Seasoned Productions. 

“CSARN commends Well
Seasoned Productions for its mandate to create work [and works] for older
performers. Canada has a rich legacy of artists who have devoted their lives to
enriching our country. But, as they age, there are fewer opportunities to work
and display their virtuosity. As an organization whose mission is to help
Canada’s senior professional artists, CSARN believes Well Seasoned Productions
should be assisted and encouraged in every way possible.”

 Scott Walker, Executive
Director, Canadian Senior Artists’ Resource Network

<h3>About the director</h3>
<p>I'm Stephanie Unger, a dancer/choreographer, writer, visual artist, and music enthusiast living in Oakland, CA. I'm originally from Florida, but spent several years as a dance artist in Chicago before settling in the Bay Area. For the last six months, I've been in the studio, developing new work. After workshopping ideas over the summer, I realized that many of my new pieces followed similar themes as work that I created 6-7 years ago. I decided to combine them into one seamless hour-long show.</p>
<p><strong><i>""Being Left, Leaving, and Being""</i></strong> is not only important to me because it is my first evening-length work as an independent artist, but it is also semi-autobiographical. The piece is full of nostalgia, recounting lost love, missed connections, and the struggle to find my place in the world. I know I'm not the only one who experiences the emotions of this work. My hope is that by celebrating the highs and lows, we find peace within ourselves and with each other.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>By contributing to this campaign, <strong>you will be a producer</strong> of our work! You'll help us create costumes, purchase materials for props (which will be more like installation art pieces), create compelling marketing pieces like posters and post cards. <strong>Even more important: </strong>you'll help provide stipends for these incredible artists. I am working with six multi-talented dancers (some sing, some write, some create visual art), two composers (with whom I worked to create original music for the show), a musician to play live accompaniment, and a lighting designer.</p>
<p>For your contribution, you will feel amazing about funding original, emotion-driven artwork! If that's not enough, we are including some amazing perks such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Autographed show post cards</li>
<li>Personalized dance phrase video </li>
<li>Opportunities to preview the work and ask questions</li>
<li>Tickets to our upcoming sneak-peek party</li>
<li>Tickets to the show</li>
<li>Canvas prints of our amazing professional photos </li>
</ul>
<p>While we would love to reach our goal, anything we receive will go directly to producing the show. If we don't reach our goal, we will have to scale back in some areas. We hope you'll help us realize our full vision!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our work is being created in order to inspire others and connect with one another. This project has brought together a group of dancers of various ages. Each dancer has many strengths and interests and bring a true sense of community to the work. My goal is to encourage and appreciate the ""fringe"" art scene. </p>
<p>I've been a part of successfully funded shows when I was working with a dance cooperative in Chicago, and I hope that this campaign will be no different. I am passionate about my work, and I hope that some of that energy will inspire you to be a part of this fundraiser.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Of course, there is a possibility that we won't reach our goal. If we can't raise all the money we intend to, we will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scale back on costumes and props.</li>
<li>Ask for a volunteer technician to run lights, without ""designing"" them.</li>
<li>Not offer various hospitality niceties, like a bar, at the show.</li>
<li>Not be able to pay the dancers a rehearsal stipend.</li>
</ul>
<p>That last one is the hardest to write. These dancers work dozens of hours in the studio and countless hours outside of the studio. They deserve to be paid for their work. However, if we don't raise enough for a rehearsal stipend, they will all receive a performance stipend regardless of our funds.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Whom will thou call?</h3>
<p><i>Ministers of Grace</i> is a  wickedly funny mash-up joy ride of Shakespeare and one of the best loved films of all time! Our production features fast-paced comedy, Shakespearean parody, supernatural shadows and spectral puppetry. The sound track includes original Elizabethan folk music with familiar sounding melodies..</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our Story:</h3>
<p>Formed in 2015 by James Ducker and Hayley Evenett, <strong>REDuck ProDUCKtions</strong> are passionate about bringing new scripts to life and showcasing East Anglian talent. A small scale production company nestled in the heart of Norwich, REDuck began as a staged rehearsed reading platform for playwrights to test out their work in progress in front of a live audience.</p>
<p>Just one year into their existence, <strong>REDuck ProDUCKtions</strong> were nominated for the <i>Norfolk Arts Theatre Award,</i> along with their co-founder Hayley Evenett being nominated for the <i>People's Choice Award</i>.</p>
<p>Last year, we discovered Jordan Monsell's incredible Shakespearean parody of Ghostbusters and before long we found ourselves staging a rehearsed reading on a nominal budget. The reading was a huge success and we know that it's a show worth seeing and with your help, we can get the full production made.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact:</h3>
<p>Edinburgh Fringe Festival is the best place to get yourself seen by industry professionals and it is our hope, that if we are able to stage this production in Edinburgh,  we may be able to tour it further around the UK (to begin with). We want to give people an opportunity to see this show and your support will make this production a reality.</p>
<h3> </h3>
</div><div>
<h3>Where the money goes:</h3>
<p>We are looking to take a cast of 8 actors and one tech manager up to Edinburgh from Norfolk and while travel is one hurdle, there's also accommodation, venue hire and promotional material. This is our cost breakdown:</p>
<p>Fringe Festival Registration: £250</p>
<p>Theatre hire: £1,500</p>
<p>Accommodation: £2,000</p>
<p>Travel: £500</p>
<p>Promotional material (flyers/posters): £250</p>
<p>Additional set required for full production: £500</p>
<p>£5,000 is a <i>HUGE</i> amount for a small scale production company, but with your help, we can reach this target and reward you for your support. </p>

<p>Hello! Allow us to introduce ourselves, we are Matt Mancuso (conception and book) and Jerome Kurtenbach (music and lyrics), the creators of the new musical Outside the Lines.</p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Three years ago, the inspiration for Outside the Lines started when a friend expressed a desire dance on a stage again. To most people that is a simple as just finding a stage to get on but this friend is an incomplete quadriplegic. From that one expressed desire the story of learning to live outside the lines that have been drawn for you was born. This campaign is important because it will help us raise the necessary funds to get this story out there. It is story that strives to say that we are all unique and no one way is the right way. It strives to say that we can be more than what we think of ourselves and more than what others might say about you. This musical challenges conventions and aims to create growth. You're generous donation will help us bring this story to its fullest life. We believe that this is a story and musical that has something for everyone and we want to bring together as many people as we can.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here's what we need: we are looking to raise $4000 so that we can have a public reading and so that we can record a demo of the music of the show to reach out to possible theatre companies and investors.</p>
<p>Wait! You're generous donation will not go unrewarded. Our perks range from social media shout outs to receiving a PRODUCER CREDIT on the demo. If you ever wanted to feel like you got in on the ground floor of something and helped it grow we are the campaign for you.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This musical has been a labor love and devotion to what theatre can do. Matt started writing the project two and half years ago and from the moment he typed the first scene, it felt like something special. Six months later, after meeting in a coffee shop, Jerome came on board and the project began to sore to new heights. Outside the Lines became more than just a love story but a story of overcoming adversity and personal demons. A story of acceptance and imagination. Of hope, enlightenment, perseverance and strength. In our climate, we need stories that challenge the way we see things and show us there are other ways. We need stories of positivity not negativity. When you donate to this campaign you are donating to that, to that story. This musical aims to bring people together not only with its story but combining elements and different styles of music so that everyone can have a great night in the theatre.</p>
<p>Matt has successfully raised money for the premiere of his first play Rum and Cookies and also ran a non-profit theatre company in Los Angeles for two years successfully raising money for its productions.</p>
<p>We know with support from people like you we can achieve the dreams we have for Outside the Lines.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Raising money for a new project especially a new musical is difficult but we believe in the show itself and all of you who are fans and friends. No matter what, we will be bringing this musical to all of you.  </p>
<p>Jerome and Matt have been working in the industry for many, many years and have seen ideas for projects come and go but Outside the Lines is one to stay. They have done their homework with editors and in-house readings, tirelessly trying out the show so that it is ready to touch the hearts and minds of many. They have contacts and have reached out to many people all over to help bring this story to life and will continue to pursue that dream with their help, support and advice.</p>

<h3>Who we are:</h3>
<p>Thiasus Productions was founded by American actress, Alix Martin, and Austrian actress, Verena Müller. After spending entirely too long bemoaning the lack of stage opportunities for actresses (primarily for themselves, but also the many other talented actresses they know - they aren't selfish), they decided to do something about it!</p>
<p>The plan for Thiasus Productions was born: create a theater company to cast all those talented actresses (and themselves - they are a little selfish). But not exclude men, or anyone else for that matter. But rather to even the odds. And to always pay the casts and directors - it may not be much, but it will always be something. Nobody has to work for ""the exposure"".</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>One can't stage shows and run a theater company without funds - who knew?!?! Thus far, we have been entirely self-funded. Which is why we are reaching out to you lovely and generous people! (Did we mention your elevated intelligence, soulful eyes, and snappy fashion sense?) Here's where the money has been spent so far has gone:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance rights for the two current shows: The Vagina Monologues and The Eight: Reindeer Monologues (no relation)</li>
<li>Paying a very generous and talented Graphic Artist for our logo and posters</li>
<li>Printing said posters</li>
</ul>
<p>What we haven't paid yet:</p>

</div></div>","Who we are:
Thiasus Productions was founded by American actress, Alix Martin, and Austrian actress, Verena Müller. After spending entirely too long bemoaning the lack of stage opportunities for actresses (primarily for themselves, but also the many other talented actresses they know - they aren't selfish), they decided to do something about it!
The plan for Thiasus Productions was born: create a theater company to cast all those talented actresses (and themselves - they are a little selfish). But not exclude men, or anyone else for that matter. But rather to even the odds. And to always pay the casts and directors - it may not be much, but it will always be something. Nobody has to work for ""the exposure"".

What We Need 
One can't stage shows and run a theater company without funds - who knew?!?! Thus far, we have been entirely self-funded. Which is why we are reaching out to you lovely and generous people! (Did we mention your elevated intelligence, soulful eyes, and snappy fashion sense?) Here's where the money has been spent so far has gone:

Performance rights for the two current shows: The Vagina Monologues and The Eight: Reindeer Monologues (no relation)
Paying a very generous and talented Graphic Artist for our logo and posters
Printing said posters

What we haven't paid yet:

Our Actresses and Actors
Our Directors
The rent on the theater spaces
Costumes, sets, props, etc.

We would never dream of asking for something for nothing (well, not here anyway). As such, we have created some fabulous perks to accompany your generous donation. (Did we mention how you light up a room just by entering it?)

<p><strong><u>A New Concept to the Story:</u>    (en francais suivra)</strong></p>
<p>Life in a rural community can be lonely for a teenage girl and her younger sister who creates an imaginary friend as a playmate.  Usually a doll the younger sister carries around, I have brought the doll to life as an on-stage character, responding and guiding with her flute.</p>
<p>Laurie, the teenage girl about to graduate, can sometimes hear those themes of innocence and whimsical fantasy, but the music becomes fainter as she is becoming a woman.  When the strict and fearful mother and grandfather appear, the imaginary friend/flutist disappears.</p>
<p>She reappears in the love duet when drifting migrant worker, Martin (who is now from Mexico), opens his soul to Laurie and is instrumental (literally) in bringing them together in a later duet as the twitter of a bird.  They confirm their love and make plans for their new life on the road.</p>
<p>However, the older drifter travelling with Martin, convinces him that the grandfather would be quick to have them arrested if Laurie comes along.   Martin reluctantly leaves with him.   Laurie discovers they have left without her, but is determined to see the world “beyond that road”.   As the mother tries her best to make her stay, the two finally have it out, expressed so brilliantly in text and music with conflicting rhythms and tempos. </p>
<p>The sister Beth is shocked as Laurie departs.   The final aria sung by the mother is about how endings are beginnings. She hugs Beth close to her.   No longer needed, the flutist exits down the road echoing the final theme of the opera as Beth waves goodbye.  </p>
<p><u>Note</u>: Beth is the only role that speaks while the others sing.  To make this production bilingual, Beth will speak in French, as she sets up the opera and often repeats what other characters have just sung.   Quebec is bilingual, so we want everyone to enjoy this opera. </p>

Laurie sur le point d’être diplômée, rêve d’une vie plus excitante loin de la ferme tandis que la cadette se crée une amie imaginaire, Danielle. Laurie planifie poursuivre son rêve avec son ami Martin, mais ce dernier l’abandonne à la ferme et quitte sans elle.

Fortunately, Marie Louise Benson, an angel at the gates of heaven, is there to help her connect with her true love. MADE IN HEAVEN is directed by Irish actor and director Maria Blaney.</p><p><strong>HOW TO GET MARRIED IN FIVE STEPS AND 17 YEARS by Kathleen Warnock</strong></p><p>In Warnock’s HOW TO GET MARRIED IN FIVE STEPS AND 17 YEARS (European premiere), Warnock documents the long journey for her and her wife to the altar. The play is performed by the playwright and directed by Margaret Van Sant.</p><p><strong>Both playwrights have deep roots in Provincetown and New York. </strong></p><p>MADE IN HEAVEN was presented at the Women's International Theater Festival and And HOW TO GET MARRIED IN FIVE STEPS IN 17 YEARS premiered in New York as part of ""Landmarks &amp; TRANSformations,"" presented by Project Y Theater at the Episcopal Actors Guild, Feb. 2017.</p><p>Candace Perry has written over 35 ten-minute plays which have been produced around the United States. She’s also written four full length plays which have had productions and staged readings, as well as several radio plays. Her work deals with issues of social justice and change.  She’s the recipient of the Cape Cod Playwrights’ Award for her full length play “Meridian Summer,” and she received a commission from the Four Squared Theater Collaborative which resulted in her full length play, “Along the River Road.” Both plays deal with racism and the legacy of slavery in the United States. Candace is an activist and feminist who believes that theater can change the world.  She is thrilled to be traveling to Ireland for the first time and honored to be a part of the IDGTF with Provincetown Dramatic Arts.</p><p>Kathleen Warnock is a New York City-based playwright who considers Provincetown a theatrical home. Her plays have been seen in New York City, London, Ireland and regionally. Provincetown Dramatic Arts produced her play, ""What to Throw Out"" in the Fall Playwrights Festival and at the International Dublin Gay Theatre Festival, 2014. In 2015, the TOSOS production of ""The Further Adventures of..."" was presented at the WITF and also went on to the Dublin Festival. And in 2016, ""Julie Andrews is the Devil,"" was presented at the WITF and went on to the IDGTF. Other plays seen in Provincetown include: ""Sharing the Pie,"" ""The Adventures of..."" ""Seattle,"" ""Not at Home,"" and a staged reading of ""The Audience,"" which returned in 2015  as ""Rock the Line."" Kathleen is a member of The Dramatists Guild. Thanks to Margaret Van Sant for her continued friendship &amp; support.</p><p><strong>PROVINCETOWN DRAMATIC ARTS COLLABORATES WITH IDGTF</strong></p><p>Provincetown Dramatic Arts is honored that this is the fourth time they have been accepted to perform at the International Dublin Gay Theatre Festival. This is a testament to the quality of work of our Provincetown and New York playwrights who are addressing important cultural issues in their plays. Through our presentations at the IDGTF, we developed a collaborative process and PDA brought and hosted Brian Merriman’s EIREBRUSHED (North American premiere) for a run in Provincetown and New York in 2016. EIREBRUSHED is the inspiring story of the gay and lesbian heroes of the Easter Rebellion of 1916.</p><p>LOVE TRUMPS EVERYTHING: TWO FROM PROVINCETOWN GO TO DUBLIN will be our first collaboration using Irish actors and directors, who will be rehearsing in Dublin, and it is our great hope these collaborations will continue and grow and allow us to host more Irish productions in Provincetown and New York.</p><p><strong>How You Can Help Us Get To Dublin </strong></p><p>LOVE TRUMPS EVERYTHING: TWO FROM PROVINCETOWN needs your help to get to Ireland. Your contribution (of any amount) will help fund the following:</p><ul>
<li>Roundtrip airfare from NYC and Boston to Dublin for the company.</li>
<li>The cost of a furnished flat (with kitchen and laundry!) in Dublin for them to stay. And presumably cook and do laundry.</li>
<li>Postcards, posters and playbills.</li>
<li>A per diem so the company doesn't have to go out busking in the street! (Though they can if they want to).</li>

Fortunately, Marie Louise Benson, an angel at the gates of heaven, is there to help her connect with her true love. MADE IN HEAVEN is directed by Irish actor and director Maria Blaney.HOW TO GET MARRIED IN FIVE STEPS AND 17 YEARS by Kathleen WarnockIn Warnock’s HOW TO GET MARRIED IN FIVE STEPS AND 17 YEARS (European premiere), Warnock documents the long journey for her and her wife to the altar. The play is performed by the playwright and directed by Margaret Van Sant.Both playwrights have deep roots in Provincetown and New York. MADE IN HEAVEN was presented at the Women's International Theater Festival and And HOW TO GET MARRIED IN FIVE STEPS IN 17 YEARS premiered in New York as part of ""Landmarks & TRANSformations,"" presented by Project Y Theater at the Episcopal Actors Guild, Feb. 2017.Candace Perry has written over 35 ten-minute plays which have been produced around the United States. She’s also written four full length plays which have had productions and staged readings, as well as several radio plays. Her work deals with issues of social justice and change.  She’s the recipient of the Cape Cod Playwrights’ Award for her full length play “Meridian Summer,” and she received a commission from the Four Squared Theater Collaborative which resulted in her full length play, “Along the River Road.” Both plays deal with racism and the legacy of slavery in the United States. Candace is an activist and feminist who believes that theater can change the world.  She is thrilled to be traveling to Ireland for the first time and honored to be a part of the IDGTF with Provincetown Dramatic Arts.Kathleen Warnock is a New York City-based playwright who considers Provincetown a theatrical home. Her plays have been seen in New York City, London, Ireland and regionally. Provincetown Dramatic Arts produced her play, ""What to Throw Out"" in the Fall Playwrights Festival and at the International Dublin Gay Theatre Festival, 2014. In 2015, the TOSOS production of ""The Further Adventures of..."" was presented at the WITF and also went on to the Dublin Festival. And in 2016, ""Julie Andrews is the Devil,"" was presented at the WITF and went on to the IDGTF. Other plays seen in Provincetown include: ""Sharing the Pie,"" ""The Adventures of..."" ""Seattle,"" ""Not at Home,"" and a staged reading of ""The Audience,"" which returned in 2015  as ""Rock the Line."" Kathleen is a member of The Dramatists Guild. Thanks to Margaret Van Sant for her continued friendship & support.PROVINCETOWN DRAMATIC ARTS COLLABORATES WITH IDGTFProvincetown Dramatic Arts is honored that this is the fourth time they have been accepted to perform at the International Dublin Gay Theatre Festival. This is a testament to the quality of work of our Provincetown and New York playwrights who are addressing important cultural issues in their plays. Through our presentations at the IDGTF, we developed a collaborative process and PDA brought and hosted Brian Merriman’s EIREBRUSHED (North American premiere) for a run in Provincetown and New York in 2016. EIREBRUSHED is the inspiring story of the gay and lesbian heroes of the Easter Rebellion of 1916.LOVE TRUMPS EVERYTHING: TWO FROM PROVINCETOWN GO TO DUBLIN will be our first collaboration using Irish actors and directors, who will be rehearsing in Dublin, and it is our great hope these collaborations will continue and grow and allow us to host more Irish productions in Provincetown and New York.How You Can Help Us Get To Dublin LOVE TRUMPS EVERYTHING: TWO FROM PROVINCETOWN needs your help to get to Ireland.

With a lot of begging and smiles we could do another edition with less money, even when the goal stated here is not met. But after years of so much contribution also by people involved outside of the scene (for example the investments made by the owner of the venue, just because he likes you people so much) it's time to 'hold up our own' and make this happen without others paying for it, right?

<h3>Background on This Project</h3>
<p>From the choreographer, Suki John....</p>
<p>""Twenty-two years ago the
world famous ballerina Alicia Alonso gave me my big break –a commission from
the Cuban National Ballet. A week before departure the composer dropped out, and
in my panic a mutual friend - the great music producer Rachel Faro - introduced me to Joel Diamond. Joel wrote a
spectacular score in one week; in fact it was so good my own father wondered if
I could equal it with my choreography! By all accounts we were a great fit and
our work, <i>After Pandora</i>, premiered at the Grand Teatro de la Habana during the International Ballet Festival. </p>
<p>Two years later Joel and I created <i>BarrigaBestia</i> for the Compañia Narciso Medina and the
first Havana festival of modern dance: Dias de la Danza. And we started
imagining another ballet - <i>Havana Love Letters</i>. In 2016 Dias de la
Danza celebrates 20 years as a month-long festival of contemporary dance. Joel
and I are still collaborating, this time on the first co-production between El
ISA, Cuba’s Juilliard, and a team of North American artists.<b> This unprecedented
collaboration is great for building bridges and inter-cultural exchange.</b></p>
<p>But for me and Joel, it’s a chance to
bring <i>Havana Love Letters</i> to life, to tell a story of love in its many
twisted and redemptive forms, and to work with the spectacular Cuban artists
who inspire us to keep making dances that spark ideas and optimism in
audiences – no matter what their language or location."" </p>

<h3>An Unprecedented Cultural Exchange</h3>
<div>
<p>This production is an historic cultural exchange between two

performers, costume and set construction, rehearsal space and performance
venue. Several dance companies in the U.S. have already expressed interest in

directors. </p>

choreographer Suki John combines contemporary moves with the story-telling
magic of classical ballet. Suki joins with New York-based composer, Joel
Diamond, whose enchanting composition weaves Latin American rhythms and poetry
into a lush new score. Suki and Joel have set six
works on major Cuban companies, including the Cuban National Ballet. They
helped inaugurate the first Cuban festival of modern dance, Dias de la Danza.<b> In April 2016, <i>Havana

 Short Summary

What is Havana Love Letters?



Havana Love Letters is a new ChoreoDrama set to premiere during Havana’s 20th Dias de la Danza Festival in April, 2016. It is the first time a North
American team of artists has co-produced a new work with the exceptional dancers, musicians and
designers of Cuba’s Juilliard – the famed Instituto Superior del Arte (El ISA). The process will be filmed and photographed in order to share the exciting behind-the-scenes trajectory of inter-cultural art making. Havana Love Letters explores the
enduring yet fickle nature of love -- romance, humor, and patience -- so important in this time of change between our two peoples.


Havana Love Letters is the creation of choreographer Suki John, composer Joel Diamond, and production designer Brian Clinnan, working closely with production staff sprinkled across the U.S. and performing artists in Havana. The majority of the funds raised will be spent in the United States in preparation for the performance project to take shape in Havana for the Dias de la Danza Festival and El ISA graduation exercises. Once the work has been developed, the composition and choreography created, it will be available for professional companies to present in Cuba and the U.S.



Background on This Project
From the choreographer, Suki John....
""Twenty-two years ago the

Magnitude of This Collaboration 
Dance goes far beyond the spoken word, communicating across
language and distance. Havana Love
Letters - or Cartas de Amor as it is titled in Cuba - creates a bridge across time and cultures. At the same time, a project of this size and scope builds channels of practical cooperation between our two peoples, who have been kept apart for far too long.

An Unprecedented Cultural Exchange

This production is an historic cultural exchange between two
countries and two accomplished groups of artists.  The production process
will be filmed and photographed, so this historic collaboration can be
shared on the screen as well as the stage. Cuban partners are shouldering the
largest costs usually associated with producing dance: providing the
performers, costume and set construction, rehearsal space and performance
venue. Several dance companies in the U.S. have already expressed interest in
performing the work Stateside, including companies boasting Cuban dancers and
directors. 

   Our Funding Goals In order to provide El ISA with the necessary components for this production, our goal is to raise $100,000 through several different revenue streams. With this campaign, we hope to reach 15% of that goal as a way provide the composer, choreographer and program assistants with support for operational expenses.
Our goal is to raise $15,000 with this platform, which will be the first of a two part series. The funds raised here will pay for transportation, housing for our team, costumes and set elements. It also guarantees that Cuban drivers, translators and filmmakers who are not paid by El ISA will be compensated fairly for their work on the project.
    The Inspirations 

Havana
Love Letters is inspired by Havana itself, by Cuban dancers and musicians,
poet Nicolas Guillen and painter Wilfredo Lam, and by Gabriel Garcia Marquez’s beloved
novel, Love in the Time of Cholera. With a passion for Cuban dance,
choreographer Suki John combines contemporary moves with the story-telling
magic of classical ballet. Suki joins with New York-based composer, Joel
Diamond, whose enchanting composition weaves Latin American rhythms and poetry
into a lush new score. Suki and Joel have set six
works on major Cuban companies, including the Cuban National Ballet. They
helped inaugurate the first Cuban festival of modern dance, Dias de la Danza. In April 2016, Havana
Love Letters will help kick off the 20th
anniversary of this month-long,
international dance festival, Dias de la Danza. 

The creative team is joined by designer Brian Clinnan, whose
magic touch fills the stage with colorful life. ChoreoDrama is a form that
includes elements of theater, scenic design, and contemporary ballet; it is
perfect for the talented artists of Cuba’s Instituto Superior del Arte, and for
telling this sweeping story of compelling characters forced to navigate the
currents of passion and history. 
    Risks & Challenges  As diplomacy and international developments ebb and flow between the United States and Cuba, this project offers an exciting opportunity to establish cultural exchange through one of Cuba's favorite art forms: dance. 
Joel and Suki have collaborated successfully on six previous ballets in the United States and Cuba - all before the re-establishment of diplomatic ties between the U.S. and Cuba. 
Suki's work with Ballet Nacional de Cuba, Danza Contemporánea de Cuba, and other major dance companies lays the foundation for this large scale event. As diplomatic ties continue to evolve, working with Cuba remains challenging on many levels.
An example of the many potential obstacles is the difficulty of carrying  costumes and set elements from the U.S. to Cuba through customs. The experienced staff,  Suki and Joel's long standing artistic contacts, and the support of El ISA will help ease the inevitable difficulties.   Ways You Can Help No gift is too small. By supporting this cause, you are actively helping develop cultural relations between United States and Cuba; essentially, extending an olive branch through dance, one of the most basic forms of human communication.
If you are unable to contribute, we encourage you to make some noise on social media about this campaign and use the IndieGoGo share tools to help us spread the word!

<p></p>
<p>But as it turns out, building a new performance space to showcase Detroit area talent is a lot more expensive than you’d think.</p>
<p>So we humbly ask for your help. It’s taken us 20 years to get this far. Without you, it could still be years more before we can give the residents of Hamtramck a cultural gem they can really be proud of, offer audiences the best all-around experience, and provide the Detroit theater community the kind of performance space it deserves.</p>

<h3>
<br/>Yeah, but what is Planet Ant Theatre anyway?</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Since its opening, Planet Ant has evolved into a cultural hub for southeastern Michigan.</p>
<p>Originally opening in 1993 as a coffeehouse, Planet Ant quickly became known for its art openings, poetry readings and open mic nights.</p>
<p>In 1996, it transitioned into a small black box storefront theatre. Keegan-Michael Key, MadTV alum and co-creator of Comedy Central’s Key and Peele, was one of the original founders of the theater, and the theater has since been an early stepping stone for many other artists who have moved on to prosperous show business careers.</p>
<p>Monday nights at Planet Ant feature the longest running improv show in Michigan, and the Home Team regularly performs for oversold houses.</p>
<p>And for those who wish to accept “Yes And” as their savior, we have provided training to 100’s of aspiring improvisers in our training center.</p>
<p>We have always striven to give artists creative freedom in our space, and thus, we’ve explored various genres and media. We plan to continue that philosophy in our new space, and this new, bigger space will allow us to offer more opportunities to more Detroit artists. This growth in our stable of artists will allow us to expand our audiences. It will also allow for an expansion of our web presence via more short films and music videos and live streaming of performances, even further expanding our audience. Ultimately, this will allow for more Detroit art to be seen around the world… and for more Detroit voices to be heard.  </p>
<p>Cool? Then help out the cause… and seriously… there could be a Tee shirt in it for ya.</p>
<h3>
<br/>How will the Ant Hall impact the community?</h3>
</div><div>
<p>The banquet hall we purchased had previously been kind of a menace to the neighborhood, frequently hosting loud parties that Hamtramck police would inevitably have to disperse. Since we’ve acquired it, several neighbors have stopped by to thank us for trying to turn the former nuisance on the block into a home for theatre and music.</p>
<p>Hamtramck, completely surrounded by the city of Detroit, has long had a reputation for being an arts community because of its vibrant music scene. The low cost of living has drawn numerous artists to the neighborhood. Detroit’s continued resurgence has further encouraged people to rediscover the area’s artsy offerings. Planet Ant’s expansion will be another crown jewel in the city’s culture scene, cementing its reputation as a place for art.</p>

<br/>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>To us, a “sold out” show has always meant 50 people. While we have had success filling our current space, we are now adding three times more seating with the new space. To fill so many seats week after week will be a challenge. Because we’ve built a large, loyal audience in our 20-year history and because we’ve earned a solid reputation for offering audiences a great night out, we are confident that people will most definitely come.</p>
<p>Also, Hamtramck is a very ethnically diverse city. We must challenge ourselves to be all inclusive in our programming, or we will risk just becoming another example of urban gentrification.</p>
</div>
</div></div>","We're in our final week of fundraising!

Thanks to the support of over 200 generous donors, we've managed to raise over $20,000 towards finishing Planet Ant Hall! That's amazing. We're already getting started using that money, making plans for the construction of the walls that will separate the theatre with the rest of the building, but there is still much to do and more money to raise. 
That's where you come in! 
We're adding some new perks in this final stretch, including a purple version of our new throwback t-shirt and a complete 2016-17 season pass for our original Planet Ant black space.
Consider make a contribution today, and please spread the word!

Here's where we're at...Planet Ant Theatre is a small, non-profit black box venue that has been a fixture in Hamtramck, Michigan, for 20 years. For 20 years, we have focused on Detroit talent, giving Detroit artists a place where they can hone their skills and express themselves.And for 20 years, we have looked longingly across the street at the old banquet hall, daydreaming about how many more opportunities we could offer to more Detroit artists if we could one day buy that place and fill it with art.  Finally, this last February, we bought it. We immediately began work cleaning it and transforming it into a space fit for theatre.  We’ve gotten from here…


To here…



But as it turns out, building a new performance space to showcase Detroit area talent is a lot more expensive than you’d think.
So we humbly ask for your help. It’s taken us 20 years to get this far. Without you, it could still be years more before we can give the residents of Hamtramck a cultural gem they can really be proud of, offer audiences the best all-around experience, and provide the Detroit theater community the kind of performance space it deserves.
Help us IndieGoGo. You’re our only hope.(Psst… hey… there could also be a Tee shirt in it for ya.)

Yeah, but what is Planet Ant Theatre anyway?

Since its opening, Planet Ant has evolved into a cultural hub for southeastern Michigan.
Originally opening in 1993 as a coffeehouse, Planet Ant quickly became known for its art openings, poetry readings and open mic nights.
In 1996, it transitioned into a small black box storefront theatre. Keegan-Michael Key, MadTV alum and co-creator of Comedy Central’s Key and Peele, was one of the original founders of the theater, and the theater has since been an early stepping stone for many other artists who have moved on to prosperous show business careers.
Monday nights at Planet Ant feature the longest running improv show in Michigan, and the Home Team regularly performs for oversold houses.
And for those who wish to accept “Yes And” as their savior, we have provided training to 100’s of aspiring improvisers in our training center.
We have always striven to give artists creative freedom in our space, and thus, we’ve explored various genres and media. We plan to continue that philosophy in our new space, and this new, bigger space will allow us to offer more opportunities to more Detroit artists. This growth in our stable of artists will allow us to expand our audiences. It will also allow for an expansion of our web presence via more short films and music videos and live streaming of performances, even further expanding our audience. Ultimately, this will allow for more Detroit art to be seen around the world… and for more Detroit voices to be heard.  
Cool? Then help out the cause… and seriously… there could be a Tee shirt in it for ya.

The banquet hall we purchased had previously been kind of a menace to the neighborhood, frequently hosting loud parties that Hamtramck police would inevitably have to disperse.

</p><p><strong>THE HISTORY</strong>:
</p><p>
Back in 2001, Spencer Green was a member of a “tightcircle” called The Stump, an internet chat room/forum populated by hundreds of entertainment industry writers, actors, directors, and producers, most of whom were vastly more well-known, rich, and powerful than him. At one of the various Stump get-togethers, Green met fellow Stumper Gary Stockdale, and they talked of pigs and wings and their love for Broadway musicals. The next day, for Gary’s amusement, Green hastily posted on The Stump a list of fictional Broadway shows that were playing, with titles like “Bergen Belsen Bingo,” “Aack! A Cathy Musical!” and “Bukowsical.” 
 
Stockdale was intrigued by the last idea and suggested that he and Green actually write some tunes based upon the conceit of the famously profane writer Charles Bukowski being an unlikely subject for a musical. This eventually led to the first productions of <i>Bukowsical</i> at Los Angeles’ respected Sacred Fools Theatre in 2006. The show took the form of a backer’s audition being held by a fictional theatre troupe called The Sacred Angel Fist Circle of Note Gang (SAFCNG), in which they beg the audience for money to mount their latest (highly questionable) project, <i>Bukowsical</i>. They believe in the power of theatre to change the world and keep on plugging away, knowing that some day the world will eventually catch on. <i>Bukowsical</i> received critical acclaim from the “L.A. Weekly” (“riotously funny”), “The Los Angeles Times” (“an uproarious romp”), and “Backstage West,” which said: “It’s terrific fun, and so wrong in all the right ways.” In February of 2007, <i>Bukowsical</i> was invited to appear at New Mexico’s prestigious Revolutions Festival, and then played at 2007’s New York Fringe Festival, where it played to sold-out crowds (Variety described the demand for tickets thusly: “It’s been a frenzy”) and won the award for Outstanding Musical. A CD of the score was released by Kritzerland Records in 2010 and productions of the show were staged by St. Louis’ New Line Theatre and Wilmington’s C’est La Guerre. 
 
After <i>Bukowsical,</i> Stockdale and Green wanted to try a different approach for a musical, something that would encompass many different song styles and that did not rely too heavily on a story-driven narrative. And thus, <i>BUMPERSTICKER</i> was born.

 Help us produce the world premiere of the new musical BUMPERSTICKER  - by the creators of the award-winning hit musical Bukowsical - at this year’s Hollywood Fringe Festival in Los Angeles, California!   We must raise $17,500 to pay for our cast and crew, equipment, venue rental, and marketing.

THE SHOW:  BUMPERSTICKER  is the brainchild of Gary Stockdale and Spencer Green, who created Bukowsical, the acclaimed musical about besotten literary hero Charles Bukowski which won Outstanding Musical at the New York International Fringe Festival.   BUMPERSTICKER is set during a massive urban traffic jam, with each song inspired by one of those blunt, punchy slogans you’ve seen on the backs of cars throughout your life--and, yes, may even have put on the back of your own car. As the frustrations of morning gridlock mount, we get to know the people and stories behind these stickers: you may enthusiastically agree or violently disagree with them but, in the end, everybody has a point of view they think is completely rational...and always correct.
Throughout the show, there will be projected images of freeways, cars and traffic, along with the actual bumperstickers that are the basis for each of the songs. There will also be an Announcer/radio D.J. who serves as our guide and as a link to the different songs, and who takes on a number of different personalities: commercial pitchman, conservative blowhard, shrill left-wing pundit, a trucker, and more. Through this structure, we hope to present a kaleidoscopic view of our culture today, in all of its divisive, varied, and uniquely American attitudes.

THE HISTORY:

Back in 2001, Spencer Green was a member of a “tightcircle” called The Stump, an internet chat room/forum populated by hundreds of entertainment industry writers, actors, directors, and producers, most of whom were vastly more well-known, rich, and powerful than him. At one of the various Stump get-togethers, Green met fellow Stumper Gary Stockdale, and they talked of pigs and wings and their love for Broadway musicals. The next day, for Gary’s amusement, Green hastily posted on The Stump a list of fictional Broadway shows that were playing, with titles like “Bergen Belsen Bingo,” “Aack! A Cathy Musical!” and “Bukowsical.” 
 
Stockdale was intrigued by the last idea and suggested that he and Green actually write some tunes based upon the conceit of the famously profane writer Charles Bukowski being an unlikely subject for a musical. This eventually led to the first productions of Bukowsical at Los Angeles’ respected Sacred Fools Theatre in 2006. The show took the form of a backer’s audition being held by a fictional theatre troupe called The Sacred Angel Fist Circle of Note Gang (SAFCNG), in which they beg the audience for money to mount their latest (highly questionable) project, Bukowsical. They believe in the power of theatre to change the world and keep on plugging away, knowing that some day the world will eventually catch on. Bukowsical received critical acclaim from the “L.A. Weekly” (“riotously funny”), “The Los Angeles Times” (“an uproarious romp”), and “Backstage West,” which said: “It’s terrific fun, and so wrong in all the right ways.” In February of 2007, Bukowsical was invited to appear at New Mexico’s prestigious Revolutions Festival, and then played at 2007’s New York Fringe Festival, where it played to sold-out crowds (Variety described the demand for tickets thusly: “It’s been a frenzy”) and won the award for Outstanding Musical. A CD of the score was released by Kritzerland Records in 2010 and productions of the show were staged by St. Louis’ New Line Theatre and Wilmington’s C’est La Guerre. 
 
After Bukowsical, Stockdale and Green wanted to try a different approach for a musical, something that would encompass many different song styles and that did not rely too heavily on a story-driven narrative. And thus, BUMPERSTICKER was born.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Reason</h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Hi, there. My name is Greg Adkins, writer of ""Executive Decision."" I've been pretty passionate about exploring characters and bringing them to life ever since third grade when I won a creative writing contest for a short story about monkeys run amok in our classroom. Since then, I like to believe the stories and the writing have grown marginally more sophisticated ... Jury's still out.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Upon moving to New York City in 1996, I fell hard for live theater. When I first saw ""Bring in da' Noise, Bring in da' Funk,"" I was both fascinated and inspired, and I knew I wanted to be involved in theater in some way. That's one reason this crowd-funding campaign is so important to me; It's an opportunity to fulfill that dream and to bring this work to a larger audience with an amazing director, an incredibly accomplished team of actors, and with a play I'm proud to showcase for three performances at the 2016 New York Theater Thespis Festival at the Hudson Guild Theater at Elliot Center (Oct. 3, 6:15 pm | Oct. 6, 9:00 pm | Oct. 9, 3:30 pm)</span></p>

</div><div>
<p>""Executive Decision"" explores Presidential politics, the backroom bargaining that is all too often a hallmark of Washington D.C., and the struggle between citizens' right-to-privacy and the U.S. intelligence apparatus. </p>
<p>In ""Executive Decision,"" we meet Madam President, a Senator who wins the Presidency in unexpected fashion.  Her opposition to the National Security Agency's domestic surveillance program, however, puts her at odds with that organization's top brass. Will she sign an executive order ending the program once and for all, or will a shadowy agent prevent her from acting on principle? </p>
<p>Recent exposure of the U.S. government's domestic surveillance and monitoring in the wake of revelations by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden have raised serious questions about how far a government should be able to go in securing its citizens. Should we as a people be more concerned with safeguarding the right to privacy, or does the protection of lives surpass even The Constitution? </p>

    The Challenges Putting on a play ain't easy. There are logistical headaches and creative differences that can threaten to derail even the most well-crafted play. This team, however, is filled with amazing individuals, seasoned professionals who understand the risks ahead and have faced them down with confidence and poise in the past.    The Alternative Even if you can't kick in financially, not to worry. We get it. It would be much appreciated, though, if you could spread the word, tap into your social media outlets, use Indiegogo's sharing options or just come check out the show!
If you're going to be in the New York City area on Oct. 3rd (6:15pm), Oct. 6th (9:00pm) or Oct. 9th (3:30pm), please visit us at the Hudson Guild Theater, Elliott Center, at 441 W. 26th St. To order tickets online, visit:

<p>It was clear that for many Filipinos, Martial Law has become an abstract idea several decades old.

<p>Through  MarkaBayan: Mga Kuwentong Hindi Mabubura  campaign, Ladies Who Launch intends to do its part by staging and touring Never Again: Voices of Martial Law (NAVoML).</p>
<p>NAVoML consists of nine (9) Martial Law-themed one-act plays grouped into sets of three (3). These plays are designed to create awareness on the martyrs of the Martial Law era, the people around them, their work and its impact on the Philippines today. </p>
<p>Notable names in theatre such as Audie Gemora, Rody Vera, Pinky Amador, Lou Veloso, Kanakan Balintagos, and Chris Martinez are involved in the production. This initiative also has the support of the Coalition Against the Burial of Marcos at LNMB, a broad coalition composed of Martial Law victims, claimants, NGOs, and various civil society groups. </p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We would like to invite you to partner with us in mounting and touring this theatrical education campaign. The play's preview will be on September 21, the anniversary of the proclamation of Martial Law. Weekend performances will run from September 23 until to October 16 at the Bantayog ng mga Bayani Auditorium.</p>
<p>The money raised in this campaign will go towards 1) funding our first season at Bantayog ng mga Bayani, including costumes, sets, and lighting design, as well as salaries and stipends for actors, playwrights, choreographers, designers, educators, stage managers, and crew, and 2) touring the production around different schools, cities, and provinces. We will put your money directly into the production. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>For as little as 500 pesos (12 USD),  you get a ticket to one show of your choice, consisting of a set of 3 plays along with our everlasting gratitude. (descriptions and schedules below.) If you are not able to enjoy the show, let us know, and it will go towards sponsoring a student who needs to learn about the Martial Law era badly. <br/><br/>You can also choose to sponsor a whole show, as well as other perk packages in this campaign  </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>What we'd like to do is unearth the stories of Martial Law and the Marcos era and make them visible, visceral, and palpable. We want those alive today to remember the victims as people, not just as statistics or bios on a website. Above all, we want to ensure that the evils of Martial Law are never forgotten, never repeated. </p>
<p>With your help, we hope to win the fight against the blatant revision of history being perpetuated by the Marcoses. In so doing, we can honor those who fought against the injustices of Martial Law, and we can make sure that the horrors of those dark days will never happen again.<br/> </p>

<h3>Project Summary</h3>
<p>Project: Motion collaborates with Carla McDonald and Courtney Oliver of FindMemphis (findmemphis.com), diving into the process and product of Carla’s photographs to show how the city informs us as artists of Memphis, how we thrive in reflecting each other, and how we inspire and in turn are inspired.  </p>
<p>Carla McDonald (formerly of The Bouffants) and Courtney Oliver are Resident Company Members with Playhouse on the Square who create and curate FindMemphis together with England-native Rory Dale. McDonald’s photographs “celebrate the unapologetic soul of a river city.” FindMemphis celebrates and promotes the goings-on of Memphis and expresses McDonald and Oliver’s shared thrill for rediscovering our hometown.</p>
<p>Our choreographers for Tiny Dances/Hidden Spaces include Ballet Memphis alum Travis Bradley; local artist and writer Sheri Bancroft; NYU Tisch alum and Memphis native Jonathan Matthews; Highlands, NC dance teacher and performer with JOYEMOVEMENT Amelia Renee Byrd; St. Mary’s and Roudnev Youth ballet instructor Erin Walter; Hutchison ballet and movement instructor Louisa Koeppel; and more.</p>
<p>Tiny Dances/Hidden Spaces will take place at the Jay Etkin Gallery in Cooper Young, October 22 at 7 pm and October 23 at 6 pm. Come learn why Dr. Elena Stoeva calls Memphis’ longest-running modern dance company’s productions “so complete, and true to the values of dance.”</p>
<p>As Memphis musician Drew Holcomb states, “Memphis doesn’t hide its scars – but instead wears them proudly as it gathers around you to tell its story.” Our artists show these stories through movement – beauty, scars and all.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Funding a show like this one is a challenge. Pre-production overhead presents a neverending series of surprises, and while we are beyond thrilled to be staging the show in the intimate setting of an art gallery, the smaller venue also limits the number of tickets and, in turn, our revenue. We are seeking donations to help us meet the expenses of staging the show, and we could use any help you can give!</p>
<ul>
<li>We hope to raise $2,000, which will let us breathe a little more easily while we prepare this marvelous dance presentation.</li>
<li>As perks, we are offering advance-sale tickets, Project: Motion t-shirts, a sneak peek at pre-show rehearsals, and signed prints of Carla McDonald's photos!</li>
<li>Whether or not we reach (or exceed!) our goal, anything raised will go directly into the production!</li>

<p><u><strong>WHO ARE WE?</strong></u></p>
<p>SVDS was established in 2015 by respected Sydney dancer and choreographer Sheena Miss Demeanour.  </p>
<p>We are not asking for donations, rather we are offering a range of discounts and rewards for people to invest in and we would be open to cross promotion for businesses that would like to partner with us.  Donations would be gratefully received should you be that way inclined, however we hope that we can offer something to you for your investment.</p>
<p>SVDS mission is to share the love of vernacular and social dance  trends of the last century by offering courses and workshops in a variety of historical dance styles. Sheena has been teaching dance classes in the inner west and central Sydney for the last 12 years offering tuition through a number of reputable Sydney dance schools.  Prior to this she taught dancing across the northern beaches and eastern suburbs for 10 years, until she found her favourite area of Sydney to settle, the Inner West.</p>
<p>Offering tuition in burlesque, feather fan dance, chair and 60s go-go, strong community interest grew in these dance styles and she then decided to dedicate a school to the vintage dance arts.   Sheena has a passion for sharing her love of dance with the world and this is just the beginning. </p>
<p>Since 2015 more styles of dance have been added to the timetable such as 30s solo blues, 40s jive, 70s soul train, adult ballet, tap and tribal bellydance.  (PLEASE SEE A COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF CLASSES ON OFFER AND OTHER CLASSES WE HOPE TO OFFER SHOULD WE GET THE FUNDS FOR THE RENOVATION AND BOND COSTS)</p>
<p>In addition to providing dance experiences for the absolute beginner through to intermediate levels, the school also offers advanced tuition for dancers to take things to the next level by way of stage performance or competition. </p>
<p>The school has taken on 2 additonal instructors (in addition to Sheena) in 2018 and the school is growing in numbers and the demand for more variety in classes is also growing.  Currently we don't have a dedicated space to offer classes from and as such a variety of venues are currently being hired in the surburbs of Newtown, Marrickville and Surry Hills to ensure classes can take place, however this restricts the class numbers and dance styles we can offer.  We have now found a space in a fabulous location with the perfect size room for SVDS’s growing timetable and class numbers. </p>
<p>This new space would enable us to provide more opportunities for the growing number of students and we will be able to offer many styles of dance not currently available in the inner west, such as feather fan dance, 60s go-go,  70s  soul train, burlesque, 20s charleston, 40s Jive, adult ballet, tribal belly dance and more.</p>
<p> There is also a growing need for affordable and available rehearsal space for artists in the inner west. This space also presents the opportunity for multi-purpose use by other artists including dancers, yoga/pilates instructors, visual artists, musicians, actors and digital media.<br/> </p>
<p><u><strong>WHAT WE WANT TO DO!</strong></u></p>
<p>We have found a fabulous location and the perfect size space for the classes currently offered by SVDS. The space is in an awesome warehouse in the thriving but still old school hub of Marrickville which will allow for more classes and more students in the class to allow for the growing numbers of students. We have been renting multiple studios across the inner west for the last 2 years, however this has restricted class numbers and dance styles we can offer and the uncertainty around the availability of spaces from month to month becomes very taxing and some times results in courses being postponed or cancelled due to not finding room availability.</p>
<p>Providing a dedicated space will provide location security and more class opportunities for the growing number of students and the offering of many styles of dance not currently offered by any other dance school in the inner west.</p>
<p>SVDS is also expanding and wants to offer children's classes in fairy fan dance, tap dance, baby ballet and drama.  This is an exciting phase in the development of the school and in fact teaching children was Sheena's first teaching role at age 17 and she is excited to revisit this side of her teaching career. </p>

</div></div>","WHO ARE WE?
SVDS was established in 2015 by respected Sydney dancer and choreographer Sheena Miss Demeanour.  
We are not asking for donations, rather we are offering a range of discounts and rewards for people to invest in and we would be open to cross promotion for businesses that would like to partner with us.  Donations would be gratefully received should you be that way inclined, however we hope that we can offer something to you for your investment.
SVDS mission is to share the love of vernacular and social dance  trends of the last century by offering courses and workshops in a variety of historical dance styles. Sheena has been teaching dance classes in the inner west and central Sydney for the last 12 years offering tuition through a number of reputable Sydney dance schools.  Prior to this she taught dancing across the northern beaches and eastern suburbs for 10 years, until she found her favourite area of Sydney to settle, the Inner West.
Offering tuition in burlesque, feather fan dance, chair and 60s go-go, strong community interest grew in these dance styles and she then decided to dedicate a school to the vintage dance arts.   Sheena has a passion for sharing her love of dance with the world and this is just the beginning. 
Since 2015 more styles of dance have been added to the timetable such as 30s solo blues, 40s jive, 70s soul train, adult ballet, tap and tribal bellydance.  (PLEASE SEE A COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF CLASSES ON OFFER AND OTHER CLASSES WE HOPE TO OFFER SHOULD WE GET THE FUNDS FOR THE RENOVATION AND BOND COSTS)
In addition to providing dance experiences for the absolute beginner through to intermediate levels, the school also offers advanced tuition for dancers to take things to the next level by way of stage performance or competition. 
The school has taken on 2 additonal instructors (in addition to Sheena) in 2018 and the school is growing in numbers and the demand for more variety in classes is also growing.  Currently we don't have a dedicated space to offer classes from and as such a variety of venues are currently being hired in the surburbs of Newtown, Marrickville and Surry Hills to ensure classes can take place, however this restricts the class numbers and dance styles we can offer.  We have now found a space in a fabulous location with the perfect size room for SVDS’s growing timetable and class numbers. 
This new space would enable us to provide more opportunities for the growing number of students and we will be able to offer many styles of dance not currently available in the inner west, such as feather fan dance, 60s go-go,  70s  soul train, burlesque, 20s charleston, 40s Jive, adult ballet, tribal belly dance and more.
 There is also a growing need for affordable and available rehearsal space for artists in the inner west. This space also presents the opportunity for multi-purpose use by other artists including dancers, yoga/pilates instructors, visual artists, musicians, actors and digital media. 
WHAT WE WANT TO DO!
We have found a fabulous location and the perfect size space for the classes currently offered by SVDS. The space is in an awesome warehouse in the thriving but still old school hub of Marrickville which will allow for more classes and more students in the class to allow for the growing numbers of students. We have been renting multiple studios across the inner west for the last 2 years, however this has restricted class numbers and dance styles we can offer and the uncertainty around the availability of spaces from month to month becomes very taxing and some times results in courses being postponed or cancelled due to not finding room availability.
Providing a dedicated space will provide location security and more class opportunities for the growing number of students and the offering of many styles of dance not currently offered by any other dance school in the inner west.
SVDS is also expanding and wants to offer children's classes in fairy fan dance, tap dance, baby ballet and drama.  This is an exciting phase in the development of the school and in fact teaching children was Sheena's first teaching role at age 17 and she is excited to revisit this side of her teaching career. 
OTHER BENEFITS OF HAVING A DEDICATED SPACE
- Being able to offer a costume wardrobe for fantasy dress ups and performance courses
- Being able to bespoke hens parties and special life event parties via any of the dance styles we offer
- Storing feather fans and chairs so that Sheena doesn't have to have them hanging out the back of her car!  LOL
- A purpose built office to enable efficient administration of the business
- Making it a warm, friendly and vintage furntiture and artefact space to further reflect the name of the school 
- Expanding the school to include childrens tuition

<h3>Get to Know Us</h3>
<p>McCormick/Durham is a unique relationship between Director, Rondrell McCormick and Playwright, Vincent Terrell Durham born over years of friendship, five acclaimed seasons with PlayGround-LA, a monumental YouTube collaboration with Black Women Talking and the upcoming short film The Old Saturday.</p>
<p>Individually They Are:</p>
<p><strong>Rondrell McCormick</strong> (Actor/Director/Singer/Writer/Music Producer).<br/>Creator of hit web series, The Wesley's, and long form P.S.A., Black Women Talking. Joseph McNeil in February One (PBS). D-Mac in Channel 00 (Spike). Dijon in Leftovers reading/Oregon Shakespeare Festival). Adrian in Smokey Joe's Cafe (Center REP/nominated for best ensemble). Cassio/understudy in Othello. Duke of Florence in All's Well That Ends Well (Shakespeare and Company). Julius in Still Standing (Vitality Productions).

Michael Stuhlbarg/A.C.T.). Richard II, Philistines (ft. Jack Willis), Good Breeding, Little Shop of Horrors, Great Catherine, Ubu Roi, La Ronde, Our Lady Of 121st Street, Seven Guitars among a host of others. Born and raised in the seams of North Carolina, he holds a B.F.A from North Carolina Agricultural And Technical State University and an M.F.A. from the prestigious, Tony Award winning, American Conservatory Theater.

<h3><strong>The Campaign</strong></h3>
<p>Our campaign is to supplement an invitation to present two nights of Vol. 1  A Post Racial America at Highways Performance Space. An invite graciously extended to McCormick/Durham by artistic directors Leo Garcia &amp; Patrick Kennelly. </p>
<h3>The Story of Vol. 1 A Post Racial America</h3>
<p>With Vol 1. A Post Racial America the team of McCormick/Durham are pouring themselves into presenting an anthology of theatrical shorts examining the notion of a Post Racial America. The pieces range from questioning the ""ism"" chosen by Martin Luther King Jr. and our Civil Rights leaders, playgrounds no longer being safe places for Black children to play, the impact of the Black Church on a same gender loving couple, a family's reconnection to love across racial lines, along with several other shorts. An ensemble of LA's top actors are excited to bring this new work to Highways Performance Space. *A special thanks to C. Jerome Woods and the Black LGBT Project for the introduction to Highways Performance Space.</p>

<p><strong>The Epic Story of Nana Banana</strong><br/>In her 78 years, my Nana has touched the lives of everyone around her. A lot of my childhood was spent at Nan's house, and I grew up with this vivacious woman as my biggest role model. Her thirst for knowledge, zest for life, and myriad of eccentricities were, like the wardrobes of handmade sweaters and scarfs, tenderly knitted and stitched by Nan into my genetics. She exposed me to the great artists, to black and white films, to Cheez Whiz and The Simpsons, to feminism and the great perils of shaving one's legs. </p>
<p>I saw and admired the strength in my Nana, but I never knew where the source of the strength originated. Thus, this project was born. I am discovering a 40 year-old story that has been right in front of me my whole life, waiting to be told. A story not only belonging to my Nana, but to her parents, children, and grandchildren. </p>
<p>It's been a remarkable process, personally, and for the entire family. Truths have been revealed, repressed feelings released, carpet-munching stories regaled, and I respect my grandmother more than ever. Nana and I are both extremely excited (and nervous) to share her story with you this summer.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong><br/>Unfortunately, the cost of creating art isn't cheap. It would be a dream if the profits from ticket sales were enough to cover the expenditures attached to producing a show, but alas, it seldom is. Because the show is being mounted out of town, the travel expenses of a three-week stay add up. I have also made the spontaneous/irrational decision to quit my job in order to work on this show with all the time and energy I have to offer, so unlike my previous theatre endeavours, I won't be able to pay out of pocket to produce this story. </p>
<p>Here is where your generous donations will go:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting my poor butt on a plane and out to Winnipeg and saving my Mum the stress of having me hitchhike. </li>
<li>Set materials, costumes, and props. </li>
<li>Promotional materials- posters, handbills, buttons, and social media exposure. </li>
<li>BONUS: The ideal outcome of this fundraising process would be to raise enough money to fly my Nana, the fabulous protagonist of the show, to Winnipeg to get to see her story debut on stage.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you donate, not only will you be elevated to the highest moral standing and guaranteed entry into the holy Thespian Afterlife (lots of wine, Maenads, and good ol' debaucherous times), but you will score some sweet, more tangible perks as well!</p>
<ul>
<li>Delicious baked goods from original Nana recipes- lemon bars, peanut butter cookies, blueberry pies, and more!</li>
<li>Super swaggy buttons!</li>
<li>Thank-you cards featuring prints of Nana's paintings!</li>
<li>Mini-Recipe books of original Nana recipes! </li>
<li>Hand-Knitted Nana creations! </li>
<li>Shout Outs/Ad Space in the show program!  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong><br/>It wasn't until about two weeks ago, that Nana realized I was performing her life story on stage, in front of an audience. I <i>swear</i> I had mentioned it to her at the beginning of the process, but we've decided to agree to disagree. This made Nan a little nervous, but together we made a list of why it's important that her story be told to others, and this turned the nerves into excitement. </p>
<ul>
<li>To give a voice to the elderly queer community. We are lucky to be seeing LGBTQ2+ stories emerging more and more frequently on stage, but unfortunately the stories of seniors are not as common. </li>
<li>To inspire those exploring their sexual identities while living under oppressive societal circumstances: religion and the church, homophobic-centric neighborhoods, professions in which being queer can cost you your job, etc. </li>
<li>To bring together a family whose shared experience caused an unspoken divide. To liberate the thoughts, opinions, and secrets kept to oneself for forty years. To normalize a family's story with less-than-normal aspects. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong><br/>No money, no problem! Support us in other ways too!</p>
<ul>
<li>Share this campaign on social media! Share anything I post in the future about this project!</li>
<li>Holler at your Winnipeg pals (everyone's got <i>at least</i> one!) and send them my way July 18-29! </li>
<li>Send your warm fuzzies and well wishes... emotional support is just as valuable!</li>

<h3>Help us tell the story of 'UMUADA'</h3>

<h3><strong>THE STORY</strong></h3>
<p style=""margin-left:30.0pt;"">My name is <strong>Paula Josa-Jones</strong>.  I am a choreographer, performer, author, activist, and the artistic director of <strong>Paula Josa-Jones/Performance Works</strong>.  For the past thirty-five years,I have been creating dance theater with my collaborators, including dancers, horses, actors, composers, musicians, set, lighting, costume and projection designers.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:30.0pt;""><strong>RIVER/BODY</strong> is an expression of what matters most to me at this time. This dance is about the intense and immediate way that our bodies and the body of the earth are inseparably intertwined. We are water bodies living on a water planet. <strong>RIVER/BODY</strong> is about awakening the compassionate heart of that relationship.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:30.0pt;"">We live on a water planet: 70% of the earth’s surface is covered with water. We are water beings:  60–70% of the human body is water. Our once casual relationship to water and often unconscious relationship to our own bodies are co-mingled in the growing social and ecological crises. <strong>RIVER/BODY</strong> is our response to the global “rising tide” of water-related concerns and connects with all of the “water-is-life” efforts around the globe. <i>We want to make dance - the precious vulnerability of the moving body -  an essential part of that conversation.</i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:30.0pt;""><strong>RIVER/BODY</strong> asks how our bodies and that of the river are connected. How does the continuous coming and going of the river waters parallel our own short lives? What are our own wild currents? What is the heart of the river, the mind of the river and how are we a part of each other?</p>
<p style=""margin-left:30.0pt;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516821176/txuouejkpjsblu737s5h.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""margin-left:30.0pt;"">I grew up in Minnesota on the Mississippi River. As a child, that river felt huge – remote and unknowable. Now I live on the Housatonic River in Kent, Connecticut. I walk along this river, drive next to it during my commutes; listen to the trains traveling the river corridor at night. This river feels intimate, sensual. The Housatonic and its relationship to the rivers of my childhood – the water that I am and the water that surrounds me - inspire me powerfully at this time.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:30.0pt;"">The<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housatonic_River"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong> Housatonic </strong></a>- named “<i>usi-a-di-en-uk</i>” meaning “<i>beyond the mountains</i>” - is wild and turbulent in some places, bucolic in others, running from Pittsfield, Massachusetts to the Long Island Sound. Besides its extraordinary beauty, the river has a troubled history, involving the unregulated dumping of toxic chemicals by General Electric upriver, which continues to affect the entire river habitat, including fish, frogs, turtles, and waterfowl. The river waters upstream are still contaminated. Further downstream, the PCB’s are held in the silt of the river bottom and the banks.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:30.0pt;"">When I first entered the river last summer with dancers Amy Wynn, Sandrine Harris and Aislinn MacMaster, I had no idea how powerful and emotional that experience would be.  Almost immediately, we felt ourselves in an intimate, even tender relationship with the “<i>beingness</i>” of the river.  Then a friend sent me this beautiful <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeeAMNxuqio"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>water story</strong></a><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeeAMNxuqio"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> </a>by Lakota artist and activist <strong>Pat McCabe</strong>, and I understood that as we moved <i>with</i> the waters, we were feeling the very consciousness of the water.  For more about that, watch this <strong><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl9OAsjzYHQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">video</a> </strong>by <strong>Bernd Muller</strong>.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:30.0pt;"">The worlds that will merge in the course of this project include artists, natural resource conservation people, outdoor recreation enthusiasts, students, lovers of art and dance - anyone who appreciates or interacts with the river. Our idea is to create shared audiences through the intersection of diverse interests at various sites.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>RIVER/BODY</strong> is a performance project in the tradition of National Park ""artists on the trail."" We see ourselves as artists-in-residence on a water trail, participants in the river and its contingent communities and ecosystems. Each time we enter the water we are dancing between two states, solid and fluid, present and transient – allowing ourselves to be transformed as we invite the audience to experience the river as an <i>""open-ended being with [its] own inherent spontaneity and active agency.""</i> (<a href=""https://www.humansandnature.org/david-abram"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>David Abram</strong></a>)</p>

<h3><strong>ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE</strong></h3>
<p style=""margin-left:30.0pt;""><strong>DANCE</strong>: Dancing in the river is very different from dancing on a stage, or even a grassy lawn.  There are the slippery rocks, the fallen logs, the continuous, persuasive current.  Entering the water, we are blending our bodies with the body of the river - allowing ourselves to <i>be danced </i>by the waters. Every performance is unique and shaped by the river on that day.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:30.0pt;""><strong>SOUND/MUSIC:</strong> We have invited musician/percussionist <strong><i><a href=""http://www.steeprockassoc.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">John Marshall</a></i></strong> and actor/vocalist <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2268770/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong><i>Evangeline Johns</i></strong></a> to join the performance.  Student performers with improvised vessels for carrying and pouring water will be an accompanying <strong>“Water Orchestra.”</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:30.0pt;""><strong>VISUAL DESIGN:</strong> Costumes will wrap and extend the bodies of the performers, integrating layers of dyed and painted fabric with natural materials such as leaves, branches, bark, and mud.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:30.0pt;""><strong>AUDIENCE: </strong>For some performances, we may invite the audience to join us in moments of sounding and moving - to deepen our shared fluidity and relationship to the river.</p>
<h3><strong>TIMELINE</strong></h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We will premiere <strong>RIVER/BODY</strong> in August 2018, taking place in Northwest Connecticut,  Massachusetts, and New York.  Sites include the Housatonic River and several tributary rivers, including the Shepaug and Ten Mile Rivers.</p>
<h3><strong>WHAT WE NEED </strong></h3>
<p style=""margin-left:30.0pt;"">We must raise $9500 to get this project afloat.  Our total budget is $30,000.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>I'm Melanie Wilderman, an Oklahoma writer and journalism professor, who has been penning poems and fan fiction since I learned my ABCs. My most recent writing passions include magazine features and short film scripts, and, <strong>as you may have guessed from this campaign, stage plays. </strong>My husband, Ted Satterfield, and I co-wrote the play <i>Alcoholidays</i>, a Christmas comedy that ran in 2013, 2015, and 2017 on Oklahoma stages.</p>
<p>I have now completed <strong>my first solo stage play, <i>Faithiest</i>, </strong>and with your help, I'm hoping to reward the actors and others who make this show possible with a more appropriate amount of pay than many usually receive. For this new show, I have teamed up with director Rodney Brazil and the theatre troupe Next Stage, who were involved in two of the three <i>Alcoholidays</i> runs and have produced numerous original shows since 2012, including <i>All My Ex Boyfriends are Gay</i>, <i>Worthy Causes</i>, and <i>Birth</i>. </p>
<p>In my experiences with producing Alcoholidays as an independent writer and artist, two of the major <strong>financial obstacles </strong>in Oklahoma theatre are 1) affording a quality venue and 2) <strong>paying actors, directors, stage managers, etc. what they deserve</strong>. Many of these creative individuals work for free or just a few dollars per performance. While they do this because they have a passion and dedication for performance, <strong>I believe they deserve more. </strong></p>
<h3>We Need Your Support</h3>
</div><div>
<p>We need your help to raise $2,000 to assist in <strong>paying our actors </strong>closer to what they deserve, and helping to pay for the venue. If additional funds are secured, they may be spent on costuming, props, or promotional materials, but our <strong>first and most important financial concern, is appropriate pay for the actors, director, stage assistants</strong>, and any others involved making <i>Faithiest</i> the play happen. </p>
<h3>Why Contribute?</h3>
<p>Your contribution will support the Oklahoma arts and the talented and hard-working individuals who bring you unique, fresh entertainment. </p>
<p>Our previous stage play, <i>Alcoholidays</i>, sold out nearly all performance dates in 2013, and then every performance in 2015. You will be contributing to a group with a proven track record of successful performances, and all contributors will be listed on the playbill to showcase the amazing support we receive from people like you! Also, make sure to check out the <strong>additional perks based on your level of contribution</strong>, including free tickets and reserved preferred seating. </p>
<h3>The Show Must Go On!</h3>
<p>Regardless of the outcome of this campaign, <strong>the show will go on </strong>starting July 20, and will run through July 29. Our hope with this campaign is that the show will go on with the talent being well compensated for all their hard work!  </p>
<p>If you can't help financially at this time, but you still support the arts and this campaign, <strong>please share our Indiegogo link via social media and email </strong>and help us spread the word! Thank you for your support of Oklahoma theatre and the arts in general. Hope to see you at <i>Faithiest</i>!

</div><div><p><strong>What's the show about? Faithiest blurb:</strong></p></div><div>
<p><i>This original, new play from Melanie Wilderman explores best friends, beliefs, and a little bit of booze. A dramatic comedy, Faithiest tells the story of small-town Oklahoma school teacher, Abagail Asher, a well-liked young woman respected as a dedicated educator, church volunteer, and all-around good person. But her standing in the community crumbles as quickly as the locals can yell, “It’s a twister!”</i></p>
<p><i>Following a destructive tornado, during which Abagail rescues a group of children, she is thrust into the national spotlight after an accidental, personal revelation during a live cable news interview. Now, everyone she's known her whole life, including her best friend of 20 years, sees her in a new light--and that light is not so heavenly. How can Abagail return to normal when her private beliefs are trending on Twitter and the people she loves most aren't sure who she is anymore? </i></p>
<p><i>From one-half of the writing duo who penned Alcoholidays, this new work brings a similar sharp wit, occasional course humor, and moments of brute poignancy to a topic best left unspoken at the dinner table: religion.</i></p>

For this new show, I have teamed up with director Rodney Brazil and the theatre troupe Next Stage, who were involved in two of the three Alcoholidays runs and have produced numerous original shows since 2012, including All My Ex Boyfriends are Gay, Worthy Causes, and Birth. 
In my experiences with producing Alcoholidays as an independent writer and artist, two of the major financial obstacles in Oklahoma theatre are 1) affording a quality venue and 2) paying actors, directors, stage managers, etc. what they deserve. Many of these creative individuals work for free or just a few dollars per performance. While they do this because they have a passion and dedication for performance, I believe they deserve more. 
We Need Your Support

We need your help to raise $2,000 to assist in paying our actors closer to what they deserve, and helping to pay for the venue. If additional funds are secured, they may be spent on costuming, props, or promotional materials, but our first and most important financial concern, is appropriate pay for the actors, director, stage assistants, and any others involved making Faithiest the play happen. 
Why Contribute?
Your contribution will support the Oklahoma arts and the talented and hard-working individuals who bring you unique, fresh entertainment. 
Our previous stage play, Alcoholidays, sold out nearly all performance dates in 2013, and then every performance in 2015. You will be contributing to a group with a proven track record of successful performances, and all contributors will be listed on the playbill to showcase the amazing support we receive from people like you! Also, make sure to check out the additional perks based on your level of contribution, including free tickets and reserved preferred seating. 
The Show Must Go On!
Regardless of the outcome of this campaign, the show will go on starting July 20, and will run through July 29. Our hope with this campaign is that the show will go on with the talent being well compensated for all their hard work!  
If you can't help financially at this time, but you still support the arts and this campaign, please share our Indiegogo link via social media and email and help us spread the word! Thank you for your support of Oklahoma theatre and the arts in general. Hope to see you at Faithiest! Get your tickets here: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/faithiest-the-play...
What's the show about? Faithiest blurb:
This original, new play from Melanie Wilderman explores best friends, beliefs, and a little bit of booze. A dramatic comedy, Faithiest tells the story of small-town Oklahoma school teacher, Abagail Asher, a well-liked young woman respected as a dedicated educator, church volunteer, and all-around good person. But her standing in the community crumbles as quickly as the locals can yell, “It’s a twister!”
Following a destructive tornado, during which Abagail rescues a group of children, she is thrust into the national spotlight after an accidental, personal revelation during a live cable news interview. Now, everyone she's known her whole life, including her best friend of 20 years, sees her in a new light--and that light is not so heavenly. How can Abagail return to normal when her private beliefs are trending on Twitter and the people she loves most aren't sure who she is anymore? 
From one-half of the writing duo who penned Alcoholidays, this new work brings a similar sharp wit, occasional course humor, and moments of brute poignancy to a topic best left unspoken at the dinner table: religion.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Who Are We?</h3>
<p>We are The Trick 'R Treaters, a professional performance troupe based out of York, Pennsylvania.  We formed out of a desire to bring something new and unique to our community.  Our mission is to create high quality entertainment experiences that inspire and spark creativity in those around us while creating a feasible way for local artists to create a livelihood from their skills in the arts.  We do not believe that you should have to live in an overcrowded and overpriced area like New York City or Los Angeles to make a living as an artist, nor should you have to be part of a union in order to obtain respect and a decent wage.  We will be creating a campaign for each theatrical project as one of several ways to offer you, our supporters, a chance to help us create these masterpieces.  It literally takes a community to put on a successful production of any size.  Our first production, Bite Size: An Evening Of Miniature Theatre, was an extraordinary experience.  We hope to bring you many more of these gems, starting with ""The Ledge"".</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need To Succeed:</h3>
<p>This particular production will cost us approximately $675.00.  This money will cover...</p>
<p>*the cost of our rehearsal space</p>
<p>*full costumes and makeup for our performers</p>
<p>*props to make the piece more realistic</p>
<p>*a base salary for the artists (both cast and crew) involved in this production</p>
<p>Individuals who contribute to this production will be listed in our program as a special sponsor of this show.  Local contributors will be invited to a special behind-the-scenes experience where you get to see all of our hard work up close and see the show before anyone else!  For our supporters who are not local, you will receive a DVD copy of the filmed performance.  We are leaving this as a flexible campaign, because every penny raised helps with our costs.  If we go over our goal, the extra money will go towards our second project in the works called ""The Reckoning"".</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact Of This Production</h3>
</div><div><p>The arts give us a chance to explore the deepest parts of the human experience.  According to the Anxiety And Depression Association Of America, approximately 40 million adults in the United States suffer from anxiety in one form or another.  That's a lot.  This piece explores this rampant yet taboo topic in a way that we feel will touch our audiences.  Anxiety is a disorder that leads to bizarre behaviors.  We hope to entertain you while shedding some light on this pretty common ailment and the stress it causes the sufferer.</p></div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div><div>
<p>We totally understand that not all of you are in a position to financially contribute to this particular production.  But don't worry, you can help us too!  Simply share our campaign all over your social media accounts.  Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, whatever you've got.  Just remember to tell your friends and fans why our mission is important to you so they know WHY it is important for them to care about us and our cause.</p>
<p>Also, if you have a business or know of a business who would like to get the word out, we are offering 3 advertisement spots in our programs for this show.  Please have any interested parties email us at albarosacats@gmail.com and put ""The Ledge Advertiser"" in the subject line.</p>

<h3>Verkörperung</h3>
<p><i>Verkörperung</i> (German noun for embodiment) is a double bill featuring two works:Tracey Norman's <i>where we intersect </i>and Angela Blumberg's solo <i>Self-Portrait</i>. A DanceWorks CoWorks event, the production takes place at The Citadel: Ross Centre for Dance from April 29th - May 2nd, 2020.</p>
<p>Angela's solo <i>Self-Portrait</i> takes inventory of a life that includes loss, hope and new beginnings. Whether physically or psychologically, choices we’ve made unconsciously have consequences that suddenly show up in our lives like uninvited guests. How do you host them? Self-Portrait is a multi-media solo combining video, spoken word and dance. The different media are used to capture the self and to delve into the complex, fractured system that the self is. </p>
<p>Tracey's piece <i>where we intersect</i> is a series of shorts - solos, duets and trios- connected into a larger work delving into the failure and recovery of the body. This collaborative work delves into the failure and recovery of the body, laying bare the stories of the body and its miraculous abilities to heal and connect. where we intersect explores the act of listening to the body. There is the listening to one’s own body and the listening we do while attending to those with whom we share space. The structure of the dance allows Tracey to engage with 6 profoundly compelling and diverse dance artists: Irvin Chow, Justine Comfort, Jesse Dell,  Rufi Oswaldo, Julia Sasso and Denise Solleza.</p>

<h3>Donations </h3>
<p>Although both our works received generous funding for their creation, we find ourselves short of funding for the production despite having applied for government funding numerous times. Donations will go towards covering our productions costs including performers' salaries, our lighting designer and stage manager and theatre rental.</p>

<p>By supporting our production you support the independent dance community in Toronto including professional dancers and choreographers, technical personnel, and venues that specialize in featuring work of independent choreographers. Both Angela and Tracey are at a point in their career where  transitioning from emerging to mid career artist takes place. Like most transitions this requires some form of re-orientation. Funding that supports grass root projects is no longer available and funding that supports established companies is not available yet. It is a time where we're figuring out how to proceed and implement new structures that allow us to continue to create work going forward.

<h2><strong><u>NI MI MADRE</u></strong></h2>
<p>Arturo began working on NI MI MADRE ten years ago in a college solo performance class. The play began as an improvised performance based on the stories Arturo remembered from his childhood and his actual journals from different points in his life. The play began as a way for Arturo to deal with his identity, and his relationship to his mother and grandmother. Over the past decade, Arturo has continued to refine and shape the beautiful narrative that exists as NI MI MADRE today.  In 2018, the first full production of NI MI MADRE, directed by Danilo Gambini, premiered at the Yale Cabaret to rave reviews.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The creative team is thrilled to be bringing NI MI MADRE to Rave Theater Festival. We want the play to continue to move people and inspire them to call their mothers, or grandmothers, or mother figures and to ask them about their unique journeys. NI MI MADRE is a ritual of forgiveness, and lineage, and history. It is for your mother, and her mother, and her mother before…</p>

The festival, produced by Ken Davenport, provides a platform for the show and an opportunity for us to connect with presenters, producers, and other artists.
